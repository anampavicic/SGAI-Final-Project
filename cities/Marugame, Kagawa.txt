== History ==
The area of Marugame was part of ancient [[Sanuki Province]] and has been inhabited since ancient times, with many [[kofun]] [[burial mound]]s found within the city limits. From the [[Heian period]] onwards, it was noted as an entry point for pilgrims to the [[Kotohira-gū]] shrine. During the [[Edo Period]], the area developed as the [[jōkamachi|castle town]] for [[Marugame Domain]], which was ruled for 210 years by the [[Kyōgoku clan]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Marugame was established with the creation of the modern municipality system on February 15, 1890. It was elevated to city status on April 1, 1890, becoming the 53rd city in Japan. During the 1950s  the southeast area of the city and some islands were amalgamated to form new parts of the city.

On March 22, 2005, the towns of [[Ayauta, Kagawa|Ayauta]] and [[Hanzan, Kagawa|Hanzan]] (both from [[Ayauta District, Kagawa|Ayauta District]]) were merged into Marugame to create the current expanded city of Marugame.
*The former [[Ayauta, Kagawa|Ayauta]] was founded in 1959 with the merger of the villages of Kumatami and Okada. Kumatama was founded by the merger of the villages of Kurikuma and Tomikuma in 1951.
*The former [[Hanzan, Kagawa|Hanzan]] was founded in 1956 with the merger of the villages of Sakamoto and Hokunji.

==Government==
Marugame has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Marugame, together with [[Naoshima, Kagawa|Naoshima]], contributes four members to the Kagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Kagawa 2nd district]] and the [[Kagawa 3rd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Marugame has a mixed economy centered on agriculture (rice, vegetables, chicken, peaches) and manufacturing along a coastal belt of reclaimed land which contains a number of [[industrial park]]s, textile plants and shipyards. Traditionally, the city was noted for its production of ''[[uchiwa]]'' fans, claiming a 90% market share; however, due to mechanization and changes in fashion, only two workshops are left in the city. Due to its well-developed transportation network, industry is expanding, and the city is increasingly becoming a [[commuter town]] for neighboring Takamatsu.

In 2015, Imabari Shipbuilding announced the construction of a large dry dock capable of building world-class containerships in Marugame.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Imabari to build giant dock in Japan |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Imabari-to-build-giant-dock-in-Japan |access-date=2023-07-18 |website=Nikkei Asia |language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Education==
Marugame has 18 public elementary schools and eight public middle schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Kagawa Prefectural Board of Education. In addition, there are one private middle school, two private high schools and two correspondence high schools. The prefecture also operates one middle school and one high school.
