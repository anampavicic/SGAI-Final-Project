==History==
Bo began its modern development with the coming of the [[Sierra Leone Government Railway]] in 1889 and became an educational centre in 1906, when the Bo Government Secondary School was established.<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Bo-Sierra-Leone Bo], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 24, 2019</ref>

The city is the administrative centre of the [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|Southern Province]]. After [[Freetown]], Bo is the leading transportation, commercial, and educational centre of Sierra Leone.

The [[Sierra Leone Government Railway]] was closed in 1974.

The [[Residency (domicile)|inhabitants]] of Bo are known for their resolve, resistance and [[hospitality]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Etymology===
According to folklore, the town was named after its generosity. An [[elephant]] was killed by a hunter, and people from the surrounding [[villages]] came to receive their share. Because the amount of meat was so large, the [[hunter]] spent days distributing it. He said "Bi-woo", which in [[Mende language]] means "this is yours," (with reference to the meat) was said so much that the area came to be known as "Bi-woo," which became "Bo".<ref name="history-of-bo-city">{{cite web |url=https://bcc.gov.sl/history-of-bo-city/ |title=History of Bo City |author=Bo City Council |access-date=October 18, 2024}}</ref>

==Government==

==Culture==

===One World Link===
In 1981 Bo District formed a 'One World Link' (OWL)<ref name=OWL>{{Cite web|url=http://oneworldlink.org.uk/|title=Home -|website=oneworldlink.org.uk}}</ref> with [[Warwick District]] in the United Kingdom. This was inspired by a desire for justice, equality, human understanding and mutual support. Over the years it has helped to strengthen both communities and their awareness of global and development issues. The many outcomes of the link include women's groups, school links, an online archive, an education programme<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oneworldlink.org.uk/primary_1/index.html|title=One World Link programme}}</ref> and the opening, in 2008, of a Community Centre in Bo city. Immediate plans include collaboration on a pilot environmental programme for the collection and disposal of waste. There is also a youth wing which has 20 registered youth groups, that serve over 1,000 young people.<ref name=OWL/>

===BODDA===
The Bo District Development Association (BODDA - UK) was formed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2003 by a group of natives from Bo District in Sierra Leone. The primary purpose for the formation of this organization is for its membership to explore every possible lawful avenue to solicit generous donations in cash, food, clothing, educational and agricultural.

Bo District Development Association has been involved in various projects including sponsorships in Sierra Leone and the UK, for example the introduction of the BODDA Civic Award in which the people of Bo are annually awarded for their contributions towards nation building and community development (this is an effort to encourage the people of Bo in national development and citizenship); donation of two hundred computers and other school materials to various schools in Bo in 2007; donation of medical equipment to the Bo Government Hospital and books to the Bo Regional library in January 2010. In August 2006, in partnership with the British Council Sierra Leone, they were able to facilitate a one-month tour for six artists from Bo with the aim of promoting awareness of global issues through music and encouraging global citizenship through the linking of youth groups in the UK and Sierra Leone.

The Organisation also awards scholarship to students from poor family backgrounds who are unable to meet their educational needs.

==Education==
The city has a campus of [[Njala University]].

As in most parts of Sierra Leone, the [[Krio language]] is widely spoken in the city Bo, although [[English language|English]] is the [[official language]] spoken at schools and government places. The Mende language is also widely understood by the city's residents, although [[Krio language|Krio]] is by far the most widely spoken language.<ref name="krio"/> Bo has one of the highest [[literacy]] rates in Sierra Leone.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

The city is home to [[Bo Teacher's College]], and hence to many [[primary school]]s as well as several [[secondary school]]s, including one of the elite secondary schools in [[West Africa]], [[Bo School|The Bo Government Secondary School]] (commonly known as Bo School).

Bo school was founded in 1906 by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[educationist]] [[Leslie Probyn]] to educate the children of Bo Town. The school has a long history of producing the elite of Sierra Leone, especially the country's top politicians. It is situated on {{convert|13.5|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land in the heart of Bo Town. The school itself is situated in pleasant surroundings and within walking distance of the government hospital, government post office, police station, and the main shopping centre of Bo Town. A football field, volleyball court, basketball court, long tennis court, and cricket pitch enrich the recreational facilities the school provides. There are plans to rehabilitate the school swimming pool. Bo School also maintains a unique tradition of seniority which has consistently augured well for social cohesion among the students. Maggots/Greeners/Rustics are either junior or newer members of the school (specifically those with more recent admission numbers). They are expected to always observe all rules of deference association with their positions and comply fully with specific instructions from senior students.

Bo is also home to the [[Bo Teacher's College]], and the newly built Bo Industrial Growth Centre, one of Sierra Leone's largest [[vocational school]]s, which was officially opened by Sierra Leone's president [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] in April 2013.<ref name="UNIDO">{{cite web |url=http://thenewrisingsun.net/ViewSingleArticle.php?ArticleID=3427|title=Bo Residents Celebrates UNIDO and Sierra Leone Government Partnership as President Koroma opens new Industrial Growth Centre Facility |author=Anthony Kamara Jr.|date=13 April 2013|website=thenewrisingsun.net}}</ref>
