'''Thừa Thiên Huế''' is a southernmost coastal [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[North Central Coast]] region, the [[Central Vietnam|Central]] of [[Vietnam]], approximately in the center of the country. It borders [[Quảng Trị province|Quảng Trị]] to the north, [[Quảng Nam]] and [[Đà Nẵng]] to the south, [[Salavan province|Salavan]] of [[Laos]] to the west and the [[South China Sea|East Sea]] to the east.

Thừa Thiên Huế has 128&nbsp;km of coastline, 22,000 [[hectare|ha]] of lagoons and over 200,000 ha of forest. There is an extensive complex of imperial tombs and temples in [[Huế]]. The province is widely called '''Xứ Huế''' (The Land of Hue).

Thừa Thiên Huế is located in the middle of North Central and South Central (including the [[South Central Coast]] and [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Hightlands]]) as a transition in many aspects: geology, climate, administrative division and local culture.

==History==
The region's history dates back some 20,800 years according to archaeological findings from the Sa Huynh Culture as well as from relics in the region. Đại Việt became an independent nation around 938 AD of which territorial conflict lasts for about four centuries between the Đại Việt and the Champa. The two provinces then changed their names to Thanh and Hóa. In 1307, Đoàn Nhữ Hài was appointed by the emperor, [[Trần Anh Tông]], to administer the area. The people from the north (Thanh Hóa) migrated south and integrated with the people of the Kingdom of Champa. During this time, had the settlement of Hoa Chau province began, which included the area of present-day Thừa Thiên.

[[File:Province de Thua-Thien (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Thua Thien province in 1909]]
Between the settlement of [[Thuận Hóa]] (1306) to the founding of Phú Xuân (1687), there were conflicts and uncertainties for the local people, which including the fall of the Trần Dynasty to the renaissance of the [[Hồ dynasty]]. Thuận Hóa and Phú Xuân became the location of the Đại Việt kingdom once [[Nguyễn Hoàng]] was appointed head of Thuận Hóa (1511–1558). Lord Nguyễn Hoàng (1558–1613) established bases at Ai Tu, Tra Bat and Dinh Cat, while his lords moved palaces to {{ill|Kim Long, Thừa Thiên Huế|lt=Kim Long|vi|Kim Long, Huế}} (1636), where they would eventually base their operations in Phú Xuân (1687). The Nguyễn lords ruled the area until it tookn over the Trinh clan in 1775. The farmers' movement led by the Tây Sơn brothers gained momentum in 1771. The [[Tây Sơn]] insurgent army won the battle in Phú Xuân to take over the Nguyễn capital in 1786, where they continued north and overthrew the Trinh Dynasty. In Phú Xuân, Nguyễn Huệ appointed himself king, and with internal differences with the Tây Sơn Movement and the death of Nguyễn Huệ (1792), Nguyễn Ánh took advantage of the situation and took over Gia Định with the support of foreign forces. Nguyễn Ánh attached to the Tây Sơn movement and took over Phú Xuân and the throne, thereby choosing the dynasty title of Gia Long (1802). Phú Xuân was again chosen as the capital of Vietnam until 1945's August Revolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thua Thien Hue some facts on historical establishment and development|url=http://english.thuathienhue.gov.vn/Main.asp?pid=6&cid=4&fid=2&aid=1&ln=en|publisher=Thừa Thiên Huế province government website|access-date=26 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003040106/http://english.thuathienhue.gov.vn/Main.asp?pid=6&cid=4&fid=2&aid=1&ln=en|archive-date=3 October 2011}}</ref> Prior to 1975, the province was known simply as '''Thừa Thiên'''.

The province is known as an area of heavy fighting during the [[Vietnam War]], as it was the second-most northerly province of the [[South Vietnam]], close to the [[North Vietnam]]ese border ([[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]) at the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]]. More U.S. soldiers died in this province than in any other province in Vietnam (2,893).<ref>http://www.rjsmith.com/kia_tbl.html" {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415135022/http://www.rjsmith.com/kia_tbl.html |date=2010-04-15 }}</ref> The [[Massacre at Huế]] occurred here; an estimated 2,800 to 6,000 civilians and [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) [[Prisoner of War|prisoners of war]] (POWs) were slaughtered by the [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]]. Thừa Thiên Huế province saw a large influx of North Vietnamese settlers soon after the [[Vietnam War]] ended, as with the rest of the former South. This province and neighbouring [[Quảng Nam province]] suffered greatly from flooding in November 1999. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Geography==
The [[Perfume River]] (called Sông Hương or Hương Giang in Vietnamese) passes through the center of province. The province also accommodates the [[Tam Giang–Cau Hai lagoon]], the largest lagoon in Southeast Asia, which is {{convert|68|km|mi}} long with a surface area of {{convert|220|km2|sqmi}}. The province comprises four different zones: a mountainous area, hills, plains and lagoons separated from the sea by sandbanks. It has {{convert|128|km|mi}} of beaches. The mountains, covering more than half the total surface of the province, are along the west and southwest border of the province, their height varying from {{convert|500|m|ft}} to {{convert|1480|m|ft}}. The hills are lower, between {{convert|20|m|ft}} and {{convert|200|m|ft}}, with some points at {{convert|400|m|ft}}, and occupy about a third of the province's area, between the mountains and the plains. The plains account for about a tenth of the surface area, with a height of only up to {{convert|20|m|ft}} above sea level. Between the hills are the lagoons which occupy the remaining five per cent of the province's surface area.<ref name="Atlas"/>

[[Bạch Mã National Park]] is a protected area near the city of Hué. It covers {{convert|220|km2|sqmi}} and comprises three zones: a strictly protected core area, an administrative area and a buffer zone. The climate is similar to central Vietnam in general: a tropical monsoon climate. In the plains and in the hills, the average annual temperature is {{convert|25|C|F}}, but in the mountains only {{convert|21|C|F}} (statistical yearbook 2004). The cool season is from November to March with cold northeasterly winds. The lowest average monthly temperature is in January: {{convert|20|C|F}}. In the cool season temperatures can fall to {{convert|12|C|F}} in the plains and the relative humidity is high, between 85 and 95 per cent. Then follows a warmer period from April to September with average monthly temperatures up to {{convert|29|C|F}} in July, reaching up to {{convert|41|C|F}} at times. It is very humid in July but relative humidity is lower, sometimes down to 50 per cent.<ref name=Villegas>Villegas 2004</ref>

The annual precipitation in the province is {{convert|3200|mm|in}} but there are important variations. Depending on the year the annual average may be {{convert|2500|mm|in}} to {{convert|3500|mm|in}} in the plains and {{convert|3000|mm|in}} to {{convert|4500|mm|in}} in the mountains. In some years the rainfall may be much higher and reach more than {{convert|5000|mm|in}} in the mountains.<ref name="Atlas">''Atlas des lagunes de Thừa Thiên Huế'', 2003</ref> The rainy season is from September to December—about 70 per cent of the precipitation occurring in those months. Rainfall often occurs in short heavy bursts which can cause flooding and erosion, with serious social, economic and environmental consequences. The floods of November 1999 led to 600 deaths and affected 600,000 homes. (Comité des inondations, 1999).<ref>{{cite journal|first=Piero|last=Villegas|year=2004|title=Flood modelling in Perfume river basin, Hue province, Vietnam|url=http://www.itc.nl/library/papers_2004/msc/wrem/villegas.pdf}}</ref><ref>[http://www.imolahue.org Integrated Management of Lagoon Activities Project] - an [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] sustainable lagoon management project in the province.</ref>

==Flora and fauna==
A remote region known as the "[[Vietnam's Green Corridor|Green Corridor]]" is home to many species. New species of [[snake]], [[butterfly]], and [[orchid]] have been found there in 2005 and 2006, as stated by Chris Dickinson of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) on 26 September 2007.<ref>[http://www.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=113941 Recent news release] by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]</ref><ref>[http://www.huegreencorridor.org The Green Corridor Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915071406/http://www.huegreencorridor.org/ |date=2007-09-15 }} - a WWF conservation endeavor located in the province.</ref> The scientists discovered 11 new species of plants and animals, including a snake, two butterflies and five leafless orchid [[Variety (botany)|varieties]]. The new snake species is a white-lipped keelback (''[[Hebius leucomystax]]'').
