The old town is encircled by a stone wall and is home to gorgeous buildings and gardens. The 17th-century palace of [[Vir Singh Deo]] is a notable example of the [[Hindu]] architecture of [[North India]]. The town serves as a trading center for grains and cotton products. [[Handloom]] weaving is an important industry. Datia has several important [[landmarks]] and is famous for the seven-story up and seven-story down palace built by Raja Vir Singh Deo in 1614. The town is also a thriving [[pilgrimage]] spot for religious devotees. There are many temples, including the Sidhapeeth of Pitambara Devi, Buglamukhi Devi Temple, and Gupteshwar Temple. [[Pitambara Peeth]] is a famous [[Shakta pitha]] located at the entrance of Datia. This pilgrimage spot is located about 1&nbsp;km from Datia Bus Station and 3&nbsp;km from Datia Railway Station on the Delhi-Chennai main line and features Buglamukhi Devi Temple. The Dhumavati Main Temple, established by Golokwasi Swamiji Maharaj and the Vankhandeshwar temple, a [[Mahabharat]] period temple of [[Shiva]] are the main attraction of the place. It was ruled by Bundela Rajputs until 1947.

==History==
{{Main|Datia State}}
The state was founded in 1626 by Bundela Rajputs. Rao Bhagwan Rao, 1st Rao of Datia and Baroni 1626/1656, received Datia and Baroni from his father, Raja Bir Singh Deo of Orchha in 1626, and established his own state. After he died in 1676, the state came under British control with other territories in [[Bundelkhand]] under the Treaty of Bassein in 1802. The ancient title of the ruling family was Maharaja Rao Raja, but in 1865 the British Government recognized only the title of Maharaja as hereditary. For the British, the Peshwa maintained a military force consisting of 945 cavalry, 5203 infantry, and 3 guns.

The motto of the royal family was Wir dalap Sharandah ("Lord of the Brave Army, Giver of Refuge"). In 1896&ndash;97, the state suffered from famine, and again to a lesser extent in 1899&ndash;1900. After India's independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Datia acceded the dominion of India, which later merged with the Union of India. Datia, together with the rest of the Bundelkhand agency, became part of the new state of Vindhya Pradesh in 1950. In 1956, the Vindhya Pradesh state was merged with certain other areas to form the state of Madhya Pradesh within the Union of India.
