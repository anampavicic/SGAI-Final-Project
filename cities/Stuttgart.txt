Since the seventh millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the [[Neckar valley]]. The [[Roman Empire]] conquered the area in AD 83 and built a massive {{lang|la|[[castrum]]}} near [[Bad Cannstatt]], making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the tenth century with its founding by [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]], [[Duke of Swabia]], as a [[stud farm]] for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Bad Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the [[House of Württemberg]], and they made it the capital of their [[county of Württemberg|county]], [[duchy of Württemberg|duchy]], and [[kingdom of Württemberg|kingdom]] from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the [[Thirty Years' War]] and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during [[World War II]]. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and became the major cultural, economic, industrial, financial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stuttgart |url=http://world-cities.eu/regions/2015-2016/indian-cities/eu/stuttgart/ |website=world-cities.eu |publisher=[[European Union]] |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015002842/http://world-cities.eu/regions/2015-2016/indian-cities/eu/stuttgart/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Stuttgart is known for its strong [[high-tech]] industry, especially in the [[automotive sector]]. It has the highest general standard of prosperity of any German city. In addition to many [[Mittelstand|medium-sized companies]], several major corporations are headquartered in Stuttgart, including [[Porsche]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and [[Mercedes-Benz Group]]. Stuttgart is an important [[financial center]]; the [[Börse Stuttgart|Stuttgart Stock Exchange]] is the second largest in Germany (after [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange|Frankfurt]]), and the [[Landesbank Baden-Württemberg]] (LBBW) is Germany's largest [[Landesbank]]. Stuttgart is also a major transport junction; it is among the most congested conurbations of Europe, and [[Stuttgart Airport|its airport]] is the [[List of the busiest airports in Germany|sixth-busiest in Germany]] (2019). Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants; according to [[Dorling Kindersley]]'s ''[[#{{sfnref|Dorling|2001}} |Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany]]'', "In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner."{{sfn|Dorling|2001|p=15}} 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Presse/pm/2007/05/PD07__183__12521,templateId=renderPrint.psml |title=Neue Daten zur Migration in Deutschland verfügbar |publisher=Destatis.de |date=20 October 2008 |access-date=14 October 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231934/http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Presse/pm/2007/05/PD07__183__12521,templateId=renderPrint.psml |archive-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> In the rest of Germany, 28.7% of people are of immigrant background, with a relatively higher percentage living in cities and former western Germany (such as Stuttgart).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bildung |first=Bundeszentrale für politische |date=2023-04-29 |title=Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund |url=https://www.bpb.de/kurz-knapp/zahlen-und-fakten/soziale-situation-in-deutschland/61646/bevoelkerung-mit-migrationshintergrund/ |access-date=2024-01-09 |website=bpb.de |language=de}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Stuttgart, often nicknamed the "''Schwabenmetropole''" ({{langx|en|[[Swabia]]n metropolis}}) in reference to its location in the centre of [[Swabia]] and the [[Swabian German|local dialect]] spoken by the native [[Swabians]], has its etymological roots in the [[Old High German]] word {{lang|goh|Stuotgarten}},<ref name="GeschStutt1">{{cite web |title=Das Mittelalter (bis 1500) |trans-title=The Middle Ages (until 1500) |url=http://www.stuttgart-geschichte.de/history/mittelalter.html |work=Die Geschichte von Stuttgart |year=2008 |access-date=14 October 2018 |language=de |archive-date=22 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122181922/http://www.stuttgart-geschichte.de/history/mittelalter.html |url-status=live }}</ref> or "[[stud farm]]",<ref name="StuttInfo">{{cite web |title=Stuttgart's History |url=http://www.stgt.com/stuttgart/historye.htm |publisher=Stuttgart Information |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=21 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021164107/http://www.stgt.com/stuttgart/historye.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> because the city was founded in 950&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]] by [[Duke]] [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] [[Duke of Swabia|of Swabia]] to breed warhorses.<ref name="EBStutt"/>

In the local dialects of [[Alemannic German]] it can be "{{lang|gsw|Schtuegert}}", and in [[Swabian German]] "{{lang|swg|Stuagart}}"; with similar variant spellings, usually dropping the central T sound.

Cannstatt was a part of the Roman [[imperial province]] [[Germania Superior]].

As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]] moved further east.

In [[Anno Domini|AD]] 950, [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Duke Liudolf]] of [[Swabia]], son of the current [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]] on a widened area of the [[Nesenbach]] river valley {{cvt|5|km|mi}} south of the old Roman castrum.<ref name="StadtHist"/> The land and title of [[Duke of Swabia]] remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later.

His son, [[Eberhard I, Count of Württemberg|Eberhard I]] "the Illustrious",<ref name="GeschStutt1"/> would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of Württemberg.

Eberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the [[anti-king]] [[Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia|Henry Raspe IV]], [[Landgrave of Thuringia]], but was thwarted by the action of Emperor [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolph I]]. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created [[Vogt]]s and [[Bailiwick]]s as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia [[Rudolf II, Duke of Austria]], eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the [[Free imperial city]] of [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311){{sfn|Dorling|2001|p=294}} to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315.<ref name="GeschStutt1"/> Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] as King of the Germans and [[Frederick the Fair|Frederick III]] as anti-king.

Towards the end of the 15th century, Count [[Ulrich V, Count of Württemberg|Ulrich V]] began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monastery]] Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the [[Estates of Württemberg]] was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in [[Leonberg]]. After the temporary partitions of the County of Württemberg by the [[Treaty of Nürtingen|Treaties of Nürtingen]], [[Treaty of Münsingen|Münsingen]], and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.<ref name="GesichichtePDF"/>

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division]], French leader [[Charles de Gaulle]] found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by [[Free French forces]] would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|General de Lattre]] to order the [[5th Armored Division (France)|French 5th Armored Division]], [[2nd Moroccan Infantry Division (France)|2nd Moroccan Infantry Division]] and [[3rd Algerian Infantry Division]] to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945.

The military government of the [[American Occupation of Germany|American occupation zone]] established a [[Displaced persons camp]] for [[displaced person]]s, mostly [[Forced labor under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Displaced persons camps |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CD%5CI%5CDisplacedpersonscamps.htm |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=5 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220505010843/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CD%5CI%5CDisplacedpersonscamps.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> There was, however, a camp located in [[Stuttgart-West]] that, until its closure and transportation of internees to [[Heidenheim an der Brenz]] in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the [[Shoah]].

An early concept of the [[Marshall Plan]] aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented [[Restatement of Policy on Germany|during a speech 6 September 1946]] given by [[US Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]] at the Stuttgart [[Staatsoper Stuttgart|Opera House]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Speech by J.F.

In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be [[Federal Republic of Germany]], and was a serious contender against [[Frankfurt]], [[Kassel]], and [[Bonn]]. All these cities were examined by the [[Parlamentarischer Rat]],<ref name=Ennen>{{cite journal |last1=Ennen |first1=Edith |last2=Höroldt |first2=Dietrich |title=Kleine Geschichte der Stadt Bonn |journal=Stollfuß Verlag |date=1967 |pages=278–279}}</ref> but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949.<ref name=Ennen/> The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.

The immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of [[Arnulf Klett]], the first [[Lord mayor|Oberbürgermeister]] of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a [[modernist]] [[Automotive city]] with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the [[Athens Charter]]. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of [[Friedrich Schiller]], the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the [[Bundesstraße 14]]. Klett also dramatically expanded the [[public transportation]] of Stuttgart with the [[Stuttgart Stadtbahn]] and, in 1961, initiated a [[Twin towns and sister cities|city partnership]] with the French city of [[Strasbourg]] as part of an attempt to mend [[France–Germany relations|Franco-German relations]]. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today.<ref name=Strasbourg>{{cite web |title=Strasbourg, twin city |url=http://www.en.strasbourg.eu/en/europe-international/partnerships-and-solidarity/strasbourg-twin-city/ |website=en.strasbourg.eu |publisher=City of Strasbourg |language=de |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=20 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020080531/http://en.strasbourg.eu/en/europe-international/partnerships-and-solidarity/strasbourg-twin-city/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then [[President of France|French president]] Charles de Gaulle visited the city and [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany,<ref>{{cite web |title=Stuttgart und Ludwigsburg: Abschied mit Rede an die deutsche Jugend |url=http://www.degaulle.lpb-bw.de/rede_deutschlandreise_3.html |publisher=Landeszantrale für politische Bildung Baden-Württemberg |language=de |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015003003/http://www.degaulle.lpb-bw.de/rede_deutschlandreise_3.html |archive-date=15 October 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Theophil |first1=Roland |title=Die Queen besucht Stuttgart |url=http://www.vonzeitzuzeit.de/index.php?template=thema&theme_id=96 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208032831/http://www.vonzeitzuzeit.de/index.php?template=thema&theme_id=96 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 February 2017 |website=vonzeitzuzeit.de |publisher=Stuttgarter-Zeitung |access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of [[Baden]] and [[Württemberg]], [[South Baden]] and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]] merged and formed the modern German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], with Stuttgart as its capital.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our State |url=https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/en/our-state/ |publisher=Baden-Württemberg |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612135812/https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/en/our-state/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in [[southern Germany]] behind [[Frankfurt]] and [[Munich]]. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of [[Heimatvertriebene|German refugees]] [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expelled from their homes and communities]] by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. [[Economic migrants]], called "''[[Gastarbeiter]]''", from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the "''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''" unfolding in [[West Germany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://servicex.stuttgart.de/lhs-services/komunis/documents/5563_1_Auslaender_in_Stuttgart_1955_bis_2005.PDF |title=Ausländer in Stuttgart 1955 bis 2005 |publisher=Statistik und Informationsmanagement |access-date=14 October 2018}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.

In May 1965 [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] made a [[List of state visits made by Elizabeth II#As Queen of the United Kingdom|state visit]] to Stuttgart and nearby [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]] and [[Schwäbisch Hall]]. Her great-grandfather [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke Francis]] (1837–1900) had been a member of the Württemberg royal family.

In the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. [[Stammheim Prison]], built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for [[Ulrike Meinhof]], [[Andreas Baader]], [[Gudrun Ensslin]], and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]], members of a communist terrorist organization known as the [[Red Army Faction]], during [[Stammheim trials|their trial]] at the [[Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart]] in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the "[[German Autumn]]" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the [[Kidnapping and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer|kidnap and murder]] of [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] and the hijacking of [[Lufthansa Flight 181]].

The trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 with the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] and the opening of the [[Stuttgart S-Bahn]] on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the [[European Union]] met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the [[Solemn Declaration on European Union]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The European Council [Stuttgart Summit 1983], Stuttgart, 17–19 June 1983 |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/1788/1/stuttgart_declaration_1983.pdf |publisher=Pittsburgh University |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=20 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420085502/http://aei.pitt.edu/1788/1/stuttgart_declaration_1983.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1986, the [[1986 European Athletics Championships|European Athletics Championships of that year]] were held in the [[MHPArena|Neckarstadion]].

Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the [[1993 World Horticultural Exposition|World Horticultural Exposition]], for which two new bridges were built,<ref>{{cite web |title=Internationale Gartenbauausstellung 1993 |url=https://structurae.net/structures/internationale-gartenbauausstellung-1993 |publisher=Structurae |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015003125/https://structurae.net/structures/internationale-gartenbauausstellung-1993 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[1993 World Championships in Athletics|World Athletics Championships]] of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete [[Sally Gunnell]] and the United States Relay team [[1993 in athletics (track and field)#World records|both set world records]]. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on [[Leipzig]] to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] as it had in 1974.

Stuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the [[Protest against Stuttgart 21|protests against the controversial]] [[Stuttgart 21]].

==== US military in Stuttgart ====
Since shortly after the end of World War&nbsp;II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the [[Cold War]] over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reserve |first=Army |url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/20940/stuttgart-military-community-a-look-back-to-1967 |title=Stuttgart military community: A look back to 1967 &#124; EUCOM, Stronger Together |publisher=Eucom.mil |access-date=14 October 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404065358/http://www.eucom.mil/article/20940/stuttgart-military-community-a-look-back-to-1967 |archive-date=4 April 2013}}</ref> Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.

In March 1946 the [[US Army]] established a unit of the [[US Constabulary]] and a headquarters at Kurmärker Kaserne (later renamed [[Patch Barracks]]) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/constab-ip.html |title=The U.S. Constabulary in Post-War Germany (1946–52) |publisher=History.army.mil |date=1 July 1946 |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=11 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011115116/https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/constab-ip.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1948 the headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usarmygermany.com/Units/USConstabulary/HQ%20Con%20profile.htm |title=United States Constabulary, Bamberg/Heidelberg/Vaihingen, Germany, 1946–1950 |publisher=USArmyGermany.com |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=24 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424021401/http://www.usarmygermany.com/Units/USConstabulary/HQ%20Con%20profile.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Vandiver |url=https://www.stripes.com/news/monument-unveiled-for-u-s-constabulary-1.85211 |title=Monument unveiled for U.S. Constabulary |work=Stripes |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015004403/https://www.stripes.com/news/monument-unveiled-for-u-s-constabulary-1.85211 |url-status=live }}</ref> The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized [[Seventh Army (United States)|7th Army]]. As the Cold War developed US Army [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed [[Kelley Barracks]] in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.

In 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to [[Saudi Arabia]] for Operations [[Desert Shield]] and [[Desert Storm]] to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eur.army.mil/organization/history.htm#post |title=History &#124; U.S. Army in Europe |publisher=Eur.army.mil |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307190247/http://www.eur.army.mil/organization/history.htm#post |archive-date=7 March 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, [[Swabian Alb]] mountains, the [[Black Forest]], [[Schurwald]], and the [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]] act as shields from harsh weather, nevertheless the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it had lasted several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging [[hailstorms]], such as in July 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Woppowa |first1=Stefan |last2=Odenhausen |first2=Michael |title=Storm Front Andreas – A 15-Minute Hailstorm With Catastrophic Consequences |url=http://www.genre.com/knowledge/publications/iipc1404-en.html |website=genre.com |publisher=GenRe |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015002940/http://www.genre.com/knowledge/publications/iipc1404-en.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as "''Hagelflieger''" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by [[Daimler AG]], who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mit Silberjodid in die Gewitterwolken |url=https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.naechste-runde-fuer-hagelflieger-hagelabwehr-findet-weitere-interessenten.1d02b00e-6ad7-4295-aa5e-76586a6b8ec6.html |date=22 April 2014 |access-date=14 October 2018 |work=Stuttgarter-Nachrichten |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015002948/https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.naechste-runde-fuer-hagelflieger-hagelabwehr-findet-weitere-interessenten.1d02b00e-6ad7-4295-aa5e-76586a6b8ec6.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Landmarks and culture ==
{{wide image|Solitude pan-pjt.jpg|1280px|Solitude Palace}}

=== Inner city ===
[[File:Stiftskirche Stuttgart.jpg|thumb|The ''Stiftskirche'', seen from south-east (Kirchstraße)]]
At the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, [[Schlossplatz, Stuttgart|Schlossplatz]]. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, ''Schlossgarten'' park which runs down to the river [[Neckar]], Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. Königstraße, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.{{sfn|Bekker|2005|p=445}}

Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II,{{sfn|Bekker|2005|p=445}} many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the [[inner city]] include:
[[File:Stuttgart AlteKanzlei01.JPG|right|thumb|The ''Alte Kanzlei'' on [[Schillerplatz (Stuttgart)|Schillerplatz]] square]]
*The ''[[Stiftskirche, Stuttgart|Stiftskirche]]'' (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534.{{sfn|Bekker|2005|p=445}} Exterior: [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]/[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern.

=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===
[[File:Feuersee Spring.jpg|thumb|The Johanneskirche on the Feuersee, designed by [[Christian Friedrich von Leins]]]] 
[[File:Killesbergpark.jpg|right|thumb|[[Killesbergpark]] with fountains and vineyards in the background]]
At the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the ''Green U''. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river [[Neckar]] and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the [[Old Castle (Stuttgart)|Old Castle]], the [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|Main Station]], the [[Staatstheater Stuttgart|State Theater]] and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens – a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.

At the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second ''Green U'' park, the larger [[Rosensteinpark]] which borders Stuttgart's [[Wilhelma]] zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King [[William I of Württemberg]], it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.

Beyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final ''Green U'' park, [[Killesbergpark]] or 'Höhenpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to [[Internment|concentration camps]]). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the [[Bundesgartenschau]] and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.

On the northern edge of the [[Rosensteinpark]] is the famous '[[Wilhelma]]', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] of [[Württemberg]]. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest [[magnolia]] grove in Europe.

Other parks in Stuttgart include the historic [[Botanischer Garten der Universität Hohenheim]] and [[Landesarboretum Baden-Württemberg]] at [[Hohenheim|Castle Hohenheim]] (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandshöhe hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Weißenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the [[Birkenkopf]] a [[Schuttberg]] (at {{cvt|511|m|ft|}} the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 [[oak]] trees, many 300–400 years old).
[[File:Birkenkopf 1.jpg|right|thumb|View from the Birkenkopf]]

There are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the [[Max-Eyth-See]], which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river [[Neckar]] near [Mühlhausen].
There are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a {{cvt|3|km|mi}} trio made up of the Bärensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.

In the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the [[St. John's Church, Stuttgart|Johanneskirche]] (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.

'''Cemeteries''' in Stuttgart include:

*The Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an [[wikt:infirmary|infirmary]] graveyard last used in 1951
*The Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to Südheimer Platz by [[Standseilbahn Stuttgart|funicular railway]]
*The [[:de:Pragfriedhof|Pragfriedhof]], with its [[Art Nouveau]] [[cremation|crematorium]]. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] of [[Alexander Nevsky]].
*The Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient [[Roman roads]] and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985

The city boasts the second-largest mineral water deposits in Europe after [[Budapest]],{{sfn|Bekker|2005|p=445}}<ref name=Typical/> with over 250 springs within the urban area.<ref name=Typical>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuttgart.de/item/show/339461 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130212094541/http://www.stuttgart.de/item/show/339461 |archive-date=12 February 2013 |title=Typical Stuttgart |work=Official website of Stuttgart |access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> The [[Athenebrunnen]] (or Fountain of Pallas Athena) is along Jean-Amery-Weg in the western part of Stuttgart, dating from 1911.

Stuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its [[Staatstheater Stuttgart|State Theatre (''Staatstheater'')]] and [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart|State Gallery (''Staatsgalerie'')]]. The ''[[Staatstheater Stuttgart|Staatstheater]]'' is home to the [[Staatsoper Stuttgart|State opera]] and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The [[Staatstheater Stuttgart|Staatstheater]] was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland "Theatre of the year" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stuttgart-tourist.de/en/a-state-opera |title=Stuttgart State Opera |work=Official website of Stuttgart |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015002926/https://www.stuttgart-tourist.de/en/a-state-opera |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Stuttgart Ballet]] is connected to names like [[John Cranko]] and [[Marcia Haydée]].

Stuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious [[symphony orchestra]]s, the [[Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra]], with famous English conductor [[Roger Norrington|Sir Roger Norrington]], who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the ''Stuttgart Sound''. They mostly perform in the ''Liederhalle'' concert hall.

The city offers two Broadway-style musical theatres, the Apollo and the Palladium Theater (each approx. 1800 seats). [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] in the nearby town of [[Ludwigsburg]] is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.

As a result of Stuttgart's long history of [[viticulture]] (Even today there are vineyards less than {{cvt|500|m|ft|0}} from the [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|Main Station]]), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the "''Stäffele''") around the city, equivalent to approximately {{cvt|20|km|mi|0}} of steps.<ref name="Stäffele">{{cite web |title=Stuttgarter Stäffele |url=https://www.stuttgart.de/item/show/14954 |website=stuttgart.de |publisher=City of Stuttgart |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=20 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220022135/http://www.stuttgart.de/item/show/14954 |url-status=live }}</ref> Later, in the early 19th century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the ''Stäffele'' were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.<ref name="Stäffele"/>

The [[Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle|Schleyerhalle]] sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.

Stuttgart's [[Swabian cuisine]], beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germany.co.uk/Food---Drink/Gourmet/article,Culinary-A-to-Z,1501.html |title=Culinary A to Z |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517064903/http://www.germany.co.uk/Food---Drink/Gourmet/article%2CCulinary-A-to-Z%2C1501.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 May 2008 |access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> For example, [[Gaisburger Marsch]] is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.

In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|Football World Cup]]. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the [[2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]]. In 2008 it was host to the [[World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships]].{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 2015, Stuttgart hosted the Protestant [[Kirchentag]] (church convention) festival, a festival that takes place in a different German city every two years.<ref>{{cite web | title=Thousands gather in Stuttgart for Germany's festival of faith and action | website=World Council of Churches | date=4 June 2015 | url=https://www.oikoumene.org/news/thousands-gather-in-stuttgart-for-germanys-festival-of-faith-and-action | access-date=8 November 2022}}</ref>

[[File:Württembergische Königskrone.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Württemberg]] crown jewels on display in the State Museum of Württemberg ([[Old Castle (Stuttgart)|Old Castle]])]]

Stuttgart is home to five of the eleven state museums in [[Baden-Württemberg]].

Next door to the Old State Gallery is the [[Neue Staatsgalerie|New State Gallery]] (1980) with its controversial modern architecture. Among others, this gallery houses works from [[Max Beckmann]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]].

The [[Old Castle (Stuttgart)|Old Castle]] is also home to the [[Landesmuseum Württemberg|State Museum of Württemberg]] which was founded in 1862 by [[William I of Württemberg]]. The museum traces the rich [[history of Württemberg]] with many artifacts from its dukes, counts and kings, as well as earlier remnants dating back to the [[Stone Age]]. On the Karlsplatz side of the Old Castle is a museum dedicated to the memory of [[Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]], former resident of Stuttgart who attempted to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] on [[20 July plot|20 July 1944]].

=== Libraries ===
[[File:StadtBibliothekStuttgart-pjt3-18.jpg|thumb|City Library]]
[[File:Wuerttembergische landesbibliothek 2005 05a.jpg|thumb|[[Württembergische Landesbibliothek|State Library of Wurttemberg]]]]
[[File:Hstas.jpg|thumb|Central State Archive]]
The {{lang|de|[[Württembergische Landesbibliothek]]}} (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-Württemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and [[Tübingen]]. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about Württemberg, called ''Württembergica''. Together with the [[Badische Landesbibliothek]] (BLB) in [[Karlsruhe]] it also has the legal deposit for Baden-Württemberg, making it an archive library.

The [[Stuttgart University]] Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the university, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the university and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area – such as the [[University of Hohenheim]] Library – it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).

The Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-Württemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy Württemberg until 1806, the Württemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen Württemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South Württemberg.

The Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.

The [[Landeskirche|Landeskirchliche]] Archives preserve the stocks of the Württemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal Württemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections. It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death's Register) in the area of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg]].

The "Archive instigator" is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about "The dead town". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] have been acquired.

There are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city.{{sfn|Christiani|2015|p=310}} The other is the Neckar-Käpt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at [[Wilhelma]] in [[Bad Cannstatt]].{{sfn|Christiani|2015|p=311}}

Stuttgart has a population of about 630,000 and is the 6th largest city in Germany. Stuttgart reached its population peak of over 100,000 in 1874. In 1946, when Stuttgart became the capital of [[Baden-Württemberg]] state, it had a population of about 415,000. In 1960s the industrialization boomed in Stuttgart due to its automobile companies [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Porsche]] and other companies came to Stuttgart. It also saw the growth of foreign population, mostly from Turkey, Greece, India, Italy and former Yugoslavian countries. The population of Stuttgart hasn't changed a lot since then due to its high rent of the city where many people moved to neighbouring municipalities.

=== Immigrants ===
More than half of the population today is not of [[Swabia]]n background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the "[[Gastarbeiter]]" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the [[Wars in Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s. Thus, as of 2022, 47% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold [[German nationality law|German citizenship]], in 2022 this had increased to 27.6%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stuttgart in Zahlen |url=https://www.stuttgart.de/service/statistik-und-wahlen/stuttgart-in-zahlen.php |access-date=2024-01-09 |website=Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart |language=de}}</ref> By end of 2018 the largest groups of foreign nationals were [[Turkish people|Turks]] (17,900), [[Greeks]] (13,757), [[Italian people|Italians]] (14,021), [[Croats]] (15,268), [[Serbs]] (5,844) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, Austria, Morocco and Cameroon. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).<ref name="stuttgart_de" />

=== Religion ===
The religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].{{sfn|Schlaich|Heckel|Heun|1997|p=28}} Since this time [[Württemberg]] has been predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://servicex.stuttgart.de/lhs-services/komunis/documents/10717_1_Religioese_Vielfalt_in_einer_wachsenden_Stadt_2014___Kirche_und_Religion_in_Stuttgart_im_Zeitverlauf.PDF |title=Religiöse Vielfalt in einer wachsenden Stadt – Kirche und Religion in Stuttgart im Zeitverlauf |access-date=14 October 2018}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Unemployment ===
Unemployment in the [[Stuttgart Region]] is above the average of [[Baden-Württemberg]], but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-Württemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 November and 9 February respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuttgart-journal.de/tp/pool/nachrichten-stuttgart/sj/2008/11/28/news/zahlen-der-arbeitlosen-in-der-region-stuttgart-1/ |title=Stuttgart Journal |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714225002/http://www.stuttgart-journal.de/tp/pool/nachrichten-stuttgart/sj/2008/11/28/news/zahlen-der-arbeitlosen-in-der-region-stuttgart-1/ |archive-date=14 July 2009 |access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref><ref>Stuttgart Zeitung 27 February 2008, regional unemployment figures</ref>

=== Crime rates ===
Stuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuttgart.de/lhs-services/komunis/documents/4034_1.PDF |title=Kriminalität im Großstadt- und Regionalvergleich 2003 |access-date=14 October 2018 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028222737/http://www.stuttgart.de/lhs-services/komunis/documents/4034_1.PDF |archive-date=28 October 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind [[Munich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hamburg.de/stadt-staat/ |title=City of Hamburg website |publisher=Hamburg.de |access-date=14 October 2018 |language=de |archive-date=15 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515001225/http://fhh.hamburg.de/stadt/Aktuell/senat/welt/konsulate/start.html |url-status=live }}</ref> 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind [[Nuremberg]].

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Stuttgart Rathaus01.JPG|thumb|upright|Stuttgart Town Hall (Rathaus)]]
When Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the [[Duchy of Württemberg]], it was governed by a type of protectorate called a [[Vogt]] appointed by the [[Duke]]. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schultheiß'. Since 1930 the title of Oberbürgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of [[lord mayor]] in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other Württemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.

At the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician [[Arnulf Klett]] as [[Burgomaster]], a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]. One former mayor was [[Manfred Rommel]] (son of perhaps the most famous German [[Field Marshal|field marshal]] of World War II, [[Erwin Rommel]]).

As the capital of [[Baden-Württemberg]], Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or [[Landtag]] as well as all Baden-Württemberg state departments.

In June 2009, for the first time the [[Green party|Greens]] gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. According to the German newspaper {{Lang|de|[[Die Welt]]}}, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial [[Stuttgart 21]] rail project.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3881313/Stuttgart-21-zieht-CDU-und-SPD-nach-unten.html |title="Stuttgart 21" zieht CDU und SPD nach unten |trans-title=Stuttgart 21 pulls down CDU and SPD |work=[[Die Welt]] |date=7 June 2009 |access-date=14 October 2018 |language=de |archive-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130223530/https://www.welt.de/politik/article3881313/Stuttgart-21-zieht-CDU-und-SPD-nach-unten.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===City districts===
The city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 [[Stadtbezirk|city district]]s<ref>{{cite web |title=Discover the city |url=https://www.stuttgart.de/en/item/show/571987 |website=stuttgart.de/en |publisher=City of Stuttgart |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=10 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010111030/http://www.stuttgart.de/en/item/show/571987 |url-status=dead}}</ref> – five "inner" districts and 18 "outer" districts. Each district has a council headed by a district director. From there, the districts are broken down into [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarters]]. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/germansocialdemo0000scho |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/germansocialdemo0000scho/page/132 132] |quote=stuttgart city districts. |title=German Social Democracy, 1905–1917: The Development of the Great Schism |first=Carl E. |last=Schorske |year=1955 |isbn=9780674351257 |access-date=14 October 2018 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref>

Total GDP of Stuttgart is €33.9&nbsp;billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== The cradle of the automobile ===
The automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by [[Karl Benz]] and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] at the [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]]). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'.<ref name=Amondson/> Today, [[Mercedes-Benz]] and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and [[Mahle GmbH|Mahle]]. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/travel/07journeys.html |title=Stuttgart, Germany; Motor Stadt (Psst!

[[File:Kriegsberg.jpg|thumb|''Kriegsberg'' vineyard in the city center]]

=== A history of wine and beer ===
Stuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untertürkheim.

Wine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, [[Blaubeuren Abbey]] was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.

Stuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the [[Württemberg (wine region)|Württemberg wine growing area]] which covers {{cvt|11522|ha}} and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German [[wine law]]. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').

Stuttgart also has several famous breweries such as [[Stuttgarter Hofbräu]], [[Dinkelacker]], and [[Schwaben Bräu]].

== Education ==
[[File:Stuttgart HochschuleFuerMusikUndDarstellendeKunst.jpg|thumb|The new building of the State University of Music and Performing Arts, designed by [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]]]
Stuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]].

The city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the [[Fraunhofer Society]] (after [[Dresden]]).

=== Tertiary education ===
The city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:
*[[University of Stuttgart]], it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-Württemberg after [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]]. Founded in 1829, it was a ''Technische Hochschule'' ("Technical University") until 1967, when it was renamed to "university". Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|main train station]], while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (''Stuttgarter Schule''). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.
*[[University of Hohenheim]], founded in 1818 as an academy for [[agricultural science]] and [[forestry]]. While these subjects are still taught there today, its other focus today is on business administration. It is located in Hohenheim quarter of the southern city district of Plieningen.
*[[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart]], founded in 1857, located in the city center, next to the [[Neue Staatsgalerie]]
*[[State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart]], one of the biggest art colleges in Germany, founded in 1761, located in the Killesberg quarter of the northern city district Stuttgart-Nord
*[[Hochschule der Medien|Stuttgart Media University]] (Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart), founded in 2001 as a university of applied sciences, a merger of the former ''College of Printing and Publishing'' and the ''College of Librarianship'', located in Vaihingen
*[[University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart|Stuttgart Technology University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für Technik Stuttgart)]], founded in 1832 as a college for craftsmanship, university of applied sciences since 1971, located in the city center, near the University of Stuttgart's city-center campus
*[[Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University|University of Cooperative Education Baden-Württemberg]], founded in 1974, with a focus on practical experience, subjects are business, technology and social work

Historically, an elite [[military academy]] existed in Stuttgart in the late 18th century (1770–1794), the [[Hohe Karlsschule]], at Solitude Castle. Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous [[Classicism|Classicist architect]], Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.

=== Primary and secondary education ===
The first [[Waldorf School]] (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the [[Waldorf-Astoria-Zigarettenfabrik|Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory]], [[Emil Molt]], and Austrian social thinker [[Rudolf Steiner]], a [[comprehensive school]] following Steiner's educational principles of [[anthroposophy]] and [[humanism|humanistic]] ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.

The [[Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium]] was created in 1668 from a historical Latin School as a model high school with the goal of modernising education. Later, the Dillman-Gymnasium, Friedrich-Eugens-Gymnasium and Karls-Gymnasium emerged from it.

=== International School ===
Since 1985 Stuttgart is home to the [[International School of Stuttgart]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Schoolyard, Inc. |url=https://www.issev.de/ |title=International School of Stuttgart |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015003035/https://www.issev.de/ |url-status=live }}</ref> one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three [[International Baccalaureate]] programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11–12).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.sitepages.com/stuttgart/PDFs/general/quick_facts.pdf |title=International School of Stuttgart – Quick Facts |access-date=14 October 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213203110/http://files.sitepages.com/stuttgart/PDFs/general/quick_facts.pdf}}</ref> The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Schoolyard, Inc. |url=https://www.issev.de/about-iss |title=About IIS |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015003020/https://www.issev.de/about-iss |url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Media and publishing ==
[[File:Stuttgart SWR-Gebäude.JPG|thumb|Headquarters of [[SWR Fernsehen|SWR]]]]
One of the headquarters of the public [[Südwestrundfunk]] (SWR; ''Southwest Broadcasting'') channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-Württemberg and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being [[Baden-Baden]] and [[Mainz]]). It also has a ''Landesmedienzentrum'', a state media center.

Furthermore, the city is a significant centre of publishing and specialist printing, with renowned houses such as [[Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck|Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]], [[:de:Ernst Klett Verlag|Ernst Klett Verlag]] (schoolbooks), [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], Metzler Verlag and [[Motor Presse]] having their head offices there.

== Transport ==
Following the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, [[Cologne]] and [[Hanover]], on 1 March 2008 a [[low emission zone]] (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (''Umweltzone''), including vehicles from abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Umweltzone und Feinstaub-Plakette: Fragen und Antworten |url=http://www.stuttgart.de/sde/item/gen/185468.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105233847/http://www.stuttgart.de/sde/menu/frame/top.php?seite=http://www.stuttgart.de/sde/item/gen/185468.htm |archive-date=5 January 2013 |access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.env-it.de/luftdaten/download/public/html/Umweltzonen/Dokumente/PDF-Versionen_Umweltzonen_Einzelne_Staedte/Umweltzone_Stuttgart_20071115.pdf PDF showing the areas of Stuttgart in the Low Emission Zone] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

=== Local transport ===

[[File:S-Bahn-Station Feuersee in Stuttgart 24.jpg|thumb|Stuttgart S-Bahn]]
[[File:stuttgart hbf1.jpg|thumb|Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (main railway station)]]

Stuttgart has a [[light rail]] system known as the [[Stuttgart Stadtbahn]]. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for ''unabhänig'' (independent), due to the system being mostly separated from road traffic.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Germany |first=Stuttgarter Nachrichten, Stuttgart |title=U für Unabhängig: Stuttgart als Stadtbahn-Baustelle |url=https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.u-fuer-unabhaengig-stuttgart-als-stadtbahn-baustelle.85721593-65f7-4af1-ace4-4ab8de2a6fb3.html |access-date=2024-01-20 |website=stuttgarter-nachrichten.de |language=de}}</ref> Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the [[Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen AG]] (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the [[Stuttgart S-Bahn]], using tracks supplied by the national [[Deutsche Bahn]] AG (DB).

A peculiarity of Stuttgart is the ''[[Stuttgart Rack Railway|Zahnradbahn]]'', a [[rack railway]] that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a ''[[Standseilbahn Stuttgart|Standseilbahn]]'', a [[funicular]] railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In [[Killesbergpark|Killesberg Park]], on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the [[Killesberg Railway|miniature railway]] run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).

Stuttgart is a hub in the [[Intercity-Express]] and [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] networks of [[Deutsche Bahn]] AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities. It also operates international services to [[Strasbourg]], Vienna, [[Zürich]] and Paris (five times a day, journey time 3 hours 11 minutes).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/international/ice-paris.shtml |title=Mit dem ICE/TGV nach Paris |publisher=Deutsche Bahn |access-date=14 October 2018 |language=de |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015003133/https://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/international/ice-paris.shtml |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Long-distance trains stop at [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof]], the city's main line terminus, which is also used by [[Interregio-Express]], [[Regional-Express]] and [[Regionalbahn]] trains for services to stations in the Stuttgart metropolitan area. The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=German Railway {{!}} G2Rail |url=https://www.g2rail.com/help/railways/db |access-date=2024-06-26 |website=www.g2rail.com}}</ref>

Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with [[classification yard|marshalling yards]] and a [[container terminal]] in the Obertürkheim area of Hedelfingen.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Rail: The ''Stuttgart 21'' project ===
After years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|main train station]] to an underground through station. The ''[[Stuttgart 21]] project'' will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and was slated to be completed in 2019, then 2021 and now 2025.

=== Air transport ===
Stuttgart is served by [[Stuttgart Airport]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Flughafen Stuttgart}}, IATA airport code ''STR''), an international airport approximately {{cvt|13|km|mi|0}} south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using [[S-Bahn]] lines S2 or S3 or Stadtbahn line U6. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.<ref>Stuttgarter Nachrichten [http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/stn/page/detail.php/15242690, German newspaper report on planned 2nd runway] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

=== Road transport ===
Stuttgart is served by [[Bundesautobahn 8|Autobahn A8]], that runs east–west from [[Karlsruhe]] to [[Munich]], and [[Bundesautobahn 81|Autobahn A81]] that runs north–south from [[Würzburg]] to [[Singen]]. The [[Bundesautobahn 831|Autobahn A831]] is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.
[[File:Stuttgart-hafen-2005.jpg|thumb|Port on Neckar River in Stuttgart]]
Besides these [[Autobahn]]s, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, [[Bundesstraße 27|B27]] and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart. There are also a number of road tunnels under intersections in the center of Stuttgart.

=== Waterways ===
Stuttgart has an inland port in Hedelfingen on the [[Neckar]].
