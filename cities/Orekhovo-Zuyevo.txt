'''Orekhovo-Zuyevo''' ({{langx|ru|Оре́хово-Зу́ево}}, {{IPA|ru|ɐˈrʲexəvə ˈzu(j)ɪvə}}) is an industrial [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russia]], located {{convert|85|km|sp=us}} east of [[Moscow]] in a forested area on the [[Klyazma River]] (a tributary of the [[Oka River|Oka]]). Orekhovo ({{langx|ru|Оре́хово}}), often pronounced only as ''Orekh'',  is a Russian word which means "nut". The city was established in 1917 when three villages ([[Orekhovo, Pokrovsky Uyezd, Vladimir Governorate|Orekhovo]], [[Zuevo]], and [[Nikolskoye, Pokrovsky Uyezd, Vladimir Governorate|Nikolskoye]]) were merged, hence its name.<ref name=Bogorodsk>{{cite book | last = Лизунов | first = Владимир С. | script-title=ru:Минувшее проходит предо мною | url = http://bogorodsk-noginsk.ru/atlas/24_lizunov.html | trans-title = The Past Is Held in Front of Me | language = ru | publisher = Богородское краеведение (Bogorodskoye District Studies) | location = Орехово-Зуево (Orekhovo-Zuyevo) | date = 1995 | access-date = May 12, 2016}}</ref> Population: {{ru-census|p2010=120,670|p2002=122,248|p1989=137,198}}

==History==
The first known facts about what now is Orekhovo-Zuyevo date back to 1209. The place was mentioned in the Moscow Chronicles as the place called "Volochok" where the battle between Vladimir's prince Yury and Ryazan's prince Izyaslav took place. The name "Volochok" (or, as it was later called, "Zuyev Volochok") is derived from the Slavic word for "portage": a place where wooden ships were carried by land from one river to another. In this place in particular, the ships were usually moved by land between the Klyazma and [[Nerskaya River]]s. The villages Orekhovo and Zuyevo were mentioned in the chronicle several more times during the Middle Ages.

In 1797, [[serfdom in Russia|serf peasant]] [[Savva Vasilyevich Morozov]] opened his first silk factory in Zuyevo. Later he shifted from silk to wool. In 1823, profits from his business allowed him to buy the freedom of himself and his sons from serfdom. His family, the [[Morozovs]] became one of the major entrepreneurial families in late [[Imperial Russia]]. In 1830, he moved his factories to the opposite bank of the Klyazma River to the place that was later named Nikolskoye.

At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, Orekhovo and Zuyevo were the third largest textile production area in Russia after Moscow and St.&nbsp;Petersburg.

The first and largest Russian strike occurred in 1885 at Morozov's textile factories in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. Starting on January&nbsp;7, 1885, at 10 o'clock in the morning, Vasily Volkov raised his hand and a red flag symbolizing victory for the workers and for all to follow him. On the fifth day of the strike, soldiers with their bayonets fixed arrived to arrest the leaders, Volkov and F. Shelukhin, at which time they shouted to their comrades and brothers, "Remember, one for all and all for one!"<ref name=OldBelievers>{{cite book | last = Лизунов | first = Владимир С. | script-title=ru:Старообрядческая Палестина (из истории Орехово-Зуевского края) | url = http://www.bogorodsk-noginsk.ru/starover/19_lizunov.html | trans-title = Old Believers Palestine (from the history of Orekhovo-Zuevo region) | language = ru | publisher = Богородское краеведение (Bogorodskoye District Studies) | location = Орехово-Зуево (Orekhovo-Zuyevo) | date = 1992 | access-date = May 12, 2016}}</ref>  This strike lasted several weeks and created the momentum for the revolutionary movement in Russia. Sometimes abbreviated as ''Orekh'' ({{langx|ru|Оре́х}}), a walnut or ''Orekhovo'' ({{langx|ru|Оре́хово}}) flavored brandy is often drank to remember the sacrifices that these strikers in 1885 went through to standup and improve the lives of workers throughout the world.<ref name=Bogorodsk/>

The Soviet of Workers' Deputies in Orekhovo were elected in March 1917 as one of the first [[Bolshevik]] [[soviets]] in Russia. Six weeks later, the birthplace of [[Savva Morozov]] was controlled by the Soviets. This was six months before the Bolshevik victory in the [[October Revolution]] in [[Petrograd]]. In May 1917, the representative of the Moscow District Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|RSDLP(b)]] wrote: "The masses in Orekhovo are very well disciplined, following the Soviet of Workers' Deputies, in which all are Bolsheviks ... The influence of this organization is such that Orekhovo is now under the dictatorship of the proletariat."<ref name=Bogorodsk/>

Orekhovo-Zuyevo was granted city status on June 3, 1917.<ref name=Bogorodsk/>

==Economy==
For almost two centuries the economy of Orekhovo-Zuyevo was built on the textile industry, growing up around Savva Vasilievich Morozov's textile production. Cotton production in Orekhovo-Zuyevo made the city the third largest industrial center in Russia at the turn of the 20th century. After the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]], Morozov's textile mills were nationalized, becoming known as "Orekhovo-Zuyevsky Khlopchato-Bumazhny Kombinat" (the Orekhovo-Zuyevo Cotton Center). Textile production continued until the 1990s, when the Soviet textile industry collapsed due to poor management and the inability to compete with imported textiles, which were of better quality and cost less. Almost all production was shut down, and the factory halls were turned into market areas and trading centers.

==Sports==
===Association football===
The city is the home of the [[FC Znamya Truda Orekhovo-Zuyevo|oldest association football team in Russia]]. The first football team in Orekhovo-Zuyevo was organized by an [[English people|English]] engineer [[Clement Charnock]], the vice-president of the Moscow Football League. It has played under several different names. In the early years it was known as "Morozovtsy" (named after the Morozov family which owned the textile production in the city). During the Soviet era, the team played under the name [[FC Znamya Truda Orekhovo-Zuyevo|Znamya Truda]] (lit. ''the Banner of Labor''). After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the team was purchased by [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] and became one of Spartak's farm teams, known as "Spartak-Orekhovo". In 2003, the team changed its name back to Znamya Truda.

In 1962, Znamya Truda reached the USSR Cup finals, losing 0:2 to [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]].

In the 2007 season, Znamya Truda played in the Central Zone of the Second Division.
