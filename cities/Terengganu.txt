'''Terengganu''' ({{IPA-may|tərəŋɡanu}}; <small>[[Terengganu Malay]]: ''Tranung''</small>, [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{Script|Arab|ترڠݢانو}} – formerly spelled '''Trengganu''' or '''Tringganu''') is a [[sultan]]ate and [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|federal state]] of [[Malaysia]]. The state is also known by its Arabic honorific, ''Dāru l-[[Iman (concept)|Īmān]]'' ("Abode of Faith"). The coastal city of [[Kuala Terengganu]], at the mouth of the [[Terengganu River]], is both the state and royal capital as well as the most populous city in Terengganu. Other major cities and towns include [[Jerteh]], [[Kuala Dungun]], [[Chukai]], [[Kuala Berang]], [[Marang, Terengganu|Marang]], and [[Bandar Permaisuri|Permaisuri]]. At 13,035 square kilometres in size and a population of over 1.2 million people in 2023, Terengganu is Malaysia's 7th largest state and 10th most populated. Terengganu, along with Kelantan, [[Perlis]], and the Federal Territory of [[Putrajaya]], is one of the most homogeneous states/territories in the country of which 95% of the population are ethnic [[Terengganuan Malay people|Malay-Muslims]] with its own distinct language/dialect, culture, history, and tradition.

Located on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Terengganu borders the state of [[Kelantan]] to the north and [[Pahang]] to the west and south, and the [[South China Sea]] to the east. Terengganu is geographically divided into sparsely populated and mountainous inland (known as the [[Pantai Timur Range|Terengganu Highlands]] of which the highest point is [[Mount Lawit (Terengganu)|Mount Lawit]] at 1,519 metres) that span from the border with Kelantan to Kemaman district and largely flat coastal plains of which most of the state's 1.1 million people are concentrated. The state is known for having the longest coastline in Peninsular Malaysia and achieved the Malaysian Book of Records for having the cleanest beach in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/terengganu-has-longest-cleanest-beach-malaysia-book-records | title=Terengganu has longest, cleanest beach: Malaysia Book of Records &#124; New Straits Times | date=25 August 2015 }}</ref> Many of the most popular islands in Malaysia are located in the state such as [[Perhentian Islands|Perhentian]], [[Kapas Island|Kapas]], and [[Redang Island|Redang]] islands, as well as [[Bidong Island]], once a refuge to tens of thousands of [[Vietnamese boat people#Refugee camps|Vietnamese refugees]] in the 1970s.

==Etymology==
There are several theories on the origin of the name "Terengganu". One theory attributes the name's origin to ''terang ganu'', [[Malay Language|Malay]] for 'bright [[rainbow]]'.<ref name="state name">{{cite web|title = Data asas dan sejarah ringkas negeri Terengganu Darul Iman|publisher=jutr.gov.my|url=http://www.jutr.gov.my/pesuma05/ASASTRG.htm|language=ms|access-date=21 March 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608121937/http://www.jutr.gov.my/pesuma05/ASASTRG.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 8 June 2007}}</ref> Another story, said to have been originally narrated by the ninth [[Sultan of Terengganu]], [[Baginda Omar]], tells of a party of [[hunters]] from [[Pahang]] roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu. One of the hunters spotted a large [[canine tooth|animal fang]] lying on the ground. A fellow party member asked what animal the fang belonged too. The hunter, not knowing which animal, simply answered ''taring anu'' (Malay: 'fang of something'). The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game, fur and sandalwood, which impressed their neighbours. They asked the hunters where they sourced their riches, to which they replied, from the land of ''taring anu'', which later evolved into Terengganu.<ref name = "state name"/> Terengganu was called '''Trangkanu''' ({{langx|th|ตรังกานู}}) by the Siamese when it was under their influence. Terengganuans usually pronounce Terengganu as '''Tranung''' or '''Ganu''' with the G often being emphasized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://terengganubereh.blogspot.com/2010/07/5-loghat-terengganu-siri-1.html|title=Pronouncing Terengganu by locals|website=Blogspot|date=6 July 2010 }}</ref>

===Chinese naming===
The traditional [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name for Terengganu has been "丁加奴" ([[Pinyin]]: dīngjiānú), which is a direct transcription of the Malay name. However, in recent years, the Chinese community in Terengganu has raised objections to the name, citing{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} that the characters used loosely translate to "giving birth to a child who will become a slave" (Chinese: 添丁加做奴). Therefore, they successfully petitioned the regulatory commission for Chinese language in Malaysia to change the Chinese name for the state to "登嘉楼" (Pinyin: dēngjiālóu), which can be loosely translated to "aspiring/stepping up to a higher level", in September 2004. The new name was in unofficial use by the state's Chinese community for at least 30 years before its official adoption.

Certain segments of the Chinese community opposed the name change, citing the fact that the new name contains too many character strokes, making it much more difficult to write. They have proposed to revert the name to the version used before 2004, but with the word "奴" (slave, which was mainly the cause of the controversy) to the similar sounding, but more positive "努" (perseverance).{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

[[Image:KlMuseumBatuBersurat.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]]. The [[Jawi alphabet]] inscriptions are of local laws influenced by [[Sharia]] and thus one of the earliest proof of [[Islam]]ic influence in Malaysia]]

===Prehistory===
Human activity may have been present in Terengganu as early as 16,000 years ago during the [[Paleolithic]] era as evidenced by the discovery of a skeleton in Gua Bewah, [[Hulu Terengganu]] in 2009. The skeleton, called ''Bewah Man'' (Malay: ''Orang Bewah''), has been analyzed as 5,000 years older than skeletons found in [[Perak Man|Perak]], making it the oldest known modern human skeleton in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2012/08/28/bewah-man-yet-to-go-home | title=Bewah Man yet to go home }}</ref>

===Hindu-Buddhist Era===
Terengganu's location by the [[South China Sea]] ensured that it was on trade routes since ancient times. Based on [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd atlus ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' referred to what is now Terengannu as either ''Perimula,'' ''Kole Polis'' or ''Tharra''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Linehan |first=W. |date=February 1951 |title=The Identifications of some of Ptolemy's Place-Names in the Golden Khersonese |url=http://myrepositori.pnm.gov.my/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/172/JB0024_ISPP.pdf?sequence=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225121127/http://myrepositori.pnm.gov.my/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/172/JB0024_ISPP.pdf?sequence=1 |archive-date=25 February 2017 |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> The earliest written reports on the area that mentioned the name "Terengganu" were by [[China|Chinese]] merchants and seafarers in the early 6th century A.D. During the early [[Hindu]]&ndash;[[Buddhist]] period, Terengganu was known as ''Tan-Tan'' which is based in what is now Kuala Telemong. It was a small ancient polity that came under the influence of [[Langkasuka]], a powerful kingdom based either in Kedah or [[Patani (historical region)|Patani]] in the 1st century AD.{{cn|date=September 2023}} In the 7th century, the dynasty of Langkasuka that once ruled over Terengganu was replaced by a new kingdom called [[Srivijaya]].{{cn|date=September 2023}} Under Srivijaya, Terengganu traded extensively with other kingdoms in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra, [[Champa]], the [[Khmer Empire]], the [[Majapahit Empire]] and especially the Chinese.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

===Medieval and early modern period=== 
Terengganu was the first Malay state to receive Islam, as attested to by the [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]] with Arabic inscriptions found in [[Kuala Berang]], the capital of the district of [[Hulu Terengganu]]. The inscribed date which is incomplete due to damage can be read as various dates from 702 to 789 AH (1303 to 1387 CE).<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rOw8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA514 |title=The Cambridge History of SouthEast Asia, Volume 1 |editor= Nicholas Tarling | editor-link=Nicholas Tarling |page=514 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=25 January 1993|isbn=978-0521355056 }}</ref> Terengganu became a [[vassal]] state of [[Malacca]], but retained considerable autonomy with the emergence of the [[Johor Sultanate]].

[[File:Mao Kun map - Songkla, Langkasuka, Kelantan, Trengganu.png|thumb|250px|A [[Mao Kun map]] from [[Wubei Zhi]] which comes from the 15th century navigation maps of [[Zheng He]] showing Trengganu (丁架路) at the top left.]]
Terengganu emerged as an independent [[sultan]]ate in 1724. The first sultan was Tun Zainal Abidin, the younger brother of a former sultan of [[Johor]], and Johor strongly influenced Terengganu's politics through the 18th century. However, in the book ''[[Tuhfat al-Nafis]]'', the author, Raja Ali Haji, mentions that in 1708, Tun Zainal Abidin was installed as the Sultan of Terengganu by Daeng Menampuk – also known as Raja Tua – under the rule of Sultan [[Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah of Johor|Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah]].

Scottish sailor [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]] was known to have made several recorded visits to Terengganu in 1719 and 1720.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sheppard |first1=M. C. ff |author-link=Mubin Sheppard|title=A Short History of Trengganu |journal=[[Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society]] |date=1949 |volume=22 |issue=3 (149) |pages=1–74 |jstor=41560096 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41560096 |issn=2304-7550}}</ref>

In 1741, Sultan Sulaiman installed Sultan Mansur as ruler of Terengganu, his rule from 1741 to 1793 saw him creating a strong united Malay front against the rising power of the [[Bugis]]. He expanded his power on a weakened and divided Kelantan in 1764, culminating in his son's marriage to the daughter of the ruler of Kelantan. European accounts of the time praised the well-ordered administration of his rule, while at the same time he was highly respected by his subjects.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Andaya |first=Barbara Watson |url=http://archive.org/details/historyofmalaysi0000anda |title=A history of Malaysia |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-312-38120-2 |location=New York |pages=85 |language=en}}</ref>

In the 19th century, Terengganu became a vassal state of the Thai [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–1932)|Rattanakosin Kingdom]], and sent tribute every year called ''[[bunga mas]]''. This occurred under the reign of [[Omar Riayat Shah of Terengganu|Sultan Omar Riayat Shah]], who was remembered as a devout ruler who promoted trade and stable government. Terengganu prospered, and was largely left alone by the authorities in [[Bangkok]] unlike in neighbouring Patani and Kelantan.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Andaya |first=Barbara Watson |title=A history of Malaysia |publisher=Martin's Press |year=1982 |pages=121}}</ref> The period also witnessed the existence of a Terengganuan vassal of [[Besut Darul Iman]].

===Modern era===
The terms of the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]] saw power over Terengganu transferred from Siam to [[British Empire|Britain]]. A British advisor was appointed to the sultan in 1919, and Terengganu become one of the [[Unfederated Malay States]]. The move was highly unpopular spurring several uprisings in 1922 and 1925 before climaxing in May 1928 with the Peasant's Rebellion (''Pemberontakan Tani'') led by [[Abdul Rahman Limbong]] which was quashed by British military force.<ref>{{cite book|page=80|title=Pemberontakan Tani 1928 di Trengganu: satu kajian ketokohan dan kepimpinan Haji Abdul Rahman Limbong|author=Timah Hamzah|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Ministry of Education Malaysia|date=1981}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], [[Japan]] occupied Terengganu and transferred sovereignty over the state back to Siam – which had been renamed Thailand in 1939 – along with [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]], and [[Perlis]]. After the defeat of Japan, British control over these Malay states was reestablished. Terengganu became a member of the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1948, then a state of a sovereign Malaya in 1957, which became Malaysia in 1963.

Following decades of rule by the [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition, the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) came to power in [[1999 Malaysian general election|1999]], making Terengganu the second state in Malaysia to be ruled by the Islamist party (the first being neighbouring Kelantan). Barisan Nasional were brought back into power in Terengganu in the [[2004 Malaysian general election]], which continued to govern it until the [[2018 Malaysian general election]].

==Geography==

Terengganu is situated in eastern [[Peninsular Malaysia]], and is bordered to the northwest by [[Kelantan]], to the southwest by [[Pahang]], and to the east by the [[South China Sea]]. The state has a total area of {{convert|13035|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="area"/> Its topographical profile ranges from relatively level on the east coast and gradually becomes more hilly and mountainous towards the west, as its western borders are delineated by the [[Pantai Timur Range]], with the highest point being [[Mount Lawit (Terengganu)|Mount Lawit]]. The range acts as the main watershed for the state's riverine systems, as it is also home to [[Kenyir Lake]], which is the source of the [[Terengganu River]], is the largest man-made lake in Malaysia and serves as the state's major reservoir. Several outlying islands, including the [[Perhentian Islands|Perhentians]], [[Kapas Island|Kapas]] and [[Redang Island|Redang]], are also a part of the state.

===Constitution===
The Constitution of Terengganu came into force in 1911. It has a supplement that came into force in 1959. The official English title for the 1911 constitution is "The Constitution of the Way of Illustrious Sovereignty". The 1959 constitutional supplement is divided into two sections. The sections' official English language titles are "The Laws of the Constitution of Terengganu (First Part)" and "The Laws of the Constitution of Terengganu (Second Part)"

===The Sultan of Terengganu===
{{Main|Sultan of Terengganu}}
The Sultan is the constitutional ruler of the state of Terengganu. The State Constitution proclaims that the Sultan is "the Ruler and fountain head of all authority of government in the State and Territory of Terengganu", the Head of the Religion of Islam in the state and the source of all titles, honours and dignities in the state. He is also vested with the Executive Power of the State. The hereditary Sultan of Terengganu since 1998 has been Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin.

====Regency====<!-- This section is linked from [[Tengku Muhammad Ismail]] -->
As per both the Malaysian and state constitutions, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] or King of Malaysia cannot simultaneously reign as federal Head of State and ruler of his own state. This means that a state ruler must appoint a [[regent]] to govern in his absence. Between 2006 and 2011, the current Sultan served as the 13th King of Malaysia, naming his eldest son and heir apparent, [[Tengku Muhammad Ismail]], as Regent (''Pemangku Raja'') of Terengganu. As he was only eight years old upon his father's election, the young Prince co-reigned with a three-member Regency Advisory Council (''Majlis Penasihat Pemangku Raja'') headed by Raja Tengku Baderulzaman (the King's younger brother) as dictated by ''syarat (2) Fasal 16 AA Undang-Undang Bagi Diri Kerajaan Terengganu (Bab Yang Kedua)'' of the Terengganu State Constitution.

=== Chief Ministers ===
{{main|Menteri Besar of Terengganu}}
When Terengganu was an absolute monarchy, the Chief Minister was selected by the Sultan. Since the declaration of independence of Malaysia ''(then called Tanah Melayu)'' and the first general election, the Chief Minister has been the State Assembly (ADUN) member elected by a majority of all State Assembly members, who are themselves elected by universal adult suffrage of the citizens of their constituencies. Below is the list of the Chief Ministers of Terengganu from 1925.

====2008 Menteri Besar appointment crisis====

Following the ruling party UMNO's return to power over Terengganu after winning 24 out of 32 seats in the [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008 general elections]], [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] (PM) [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] put forth the reappointment of Datuk Seri [[Idris Jusoh]] to a second term as [[Menteri Besar]]. In what political analysts described as a possible [[constitutional crisis]], trouble began to precipitate after the [[Sultan of Terengganu]], Tuanku [[Mizan Zainal Abidin]], who is also the then [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King) of Malaysia refused to re-appoint and swear in Idris as Menteri Besar.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title =State tussle, national crisis? | publisher=[[The Straits Times]] | author=Carolyn Hong | url =http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_220141.html}}</ref> Similar problems occurred in the state of [[Perlis]] where the PM's choice was also rejected, in which the latter eventually gave in to its Sultan.<ref>{{cite news |date=24 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title =Malaysian king, prime minister in conflict over appointment as constitutional crisis looms | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/24/asia/AS-GEN-Malaysia-Royal-Row.php}}</ref>

The [[Sultan of Terengganu]] appointed [[Ahmad Said (politician)|Ahmad Said]] instead for the job, with the Regency Advisory Council handing him the letter of appointment. The PM claimed that the appointment of [[Ahmad Said (politician)|Ahmad Said]] was unconstitutional as it went against the wishes of the assemblymen and the Prime Minister's office who have supported [[Idris Jusoh]] candidacy for Menteri Besar.<ref>{{cite news| title =Terengganu MB Appointment Unconstitutional, Says Abdullah| publisher= Bernama| url =http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=322201}}</ref>

In spite of threats to strip [[Ahmad Said (politician)|Ahmad Said]] of his party membership "for disobeying the leadership", he went to the office in Wisma Darul Iman to begin the first day of his new appointment on 25 March 2008. The party announced earlier that they made good on their promise to remove his membership, which technically disqualifies him to be appointed as Menteri Besar in the first place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/23/nation/20730032|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201035216/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F23%2Fnation%2F20730032|url-status=dead|title=Sultan's choice of MB stripped of Umno membership|archive-date=1 February 2009}}</ref> The ruling also planned to vote down the sultan's choice through a motion of [[vote of no confidence|no-confidence]] by 22 UMNO state assemblymen.

The opposition party [[Parti Islam SeMalaysia]] in the meantime promised that its assemblymen would support Ahmad Said as Menteri Besar.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title=PKR lodges report against Umno leaders and reps |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/25/nation/20740803&sec=nation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521102650/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F25%2Fnation%2F20740803&sec=nation |archive-date=21 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 26 March 2008 however, PM [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] and Sultan [[Mizan Zainal Abidin]] met at [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]] to resolve the deadlock.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title=PM to see King over MB issue |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/26/nation/20747441&sec=nation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415203649/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F26%2Fnation%2F20747441&sec=nation |archive-date=15 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Prime Minister reversed his stance and decided to accept the King's appointment of [[Ahmad Said (politician)|Ahmad Said]] as Chief Minister of Terengganu.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 March 2008 |access-date=26 March 2008 |title=Ahmad Said stays Mentri Besar |publisher=Malaysia Insider |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/mni/ahmad-said-to-stay-on-as-mb.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329211011/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/mni/ahmad-said-to-stay-on-as-mb.html |archive-date=29 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=30 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title=Ahmad Said sworn in as Terengganu MB |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/30/nation/20080330130900&sec=nation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410030033/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F30%2Fnation%2F20080330130900&sec=nation |archive-date=10 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He also apologised to the King for the public spat over the appointment of the Menteri Besar, explaining that there was no intention to disparage or humiliate the royal household.

The apparent backdown was due to threat that the royal household would be prepared to dissolve the state assembly if the motion of no-confidence was initiated against [[Ahmad Said (politician)|Ahmad Said]], which would trigger another election in what is already a climate of discontent towards the ruling party and the possibility of dissenting assemblymen defecting to the opposition.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title =Abdullah in sticky situation in Terengganu | publisher=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]] | author=S JAYASANKARAN | url =http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sub/news/story/0,4574,272409,00.html}}</ref>

The [[UMNO]] Supreme Council proceeded to endorse Ahmad Said as the new Menteri Besar of Terengganu. With the resolution of the impasse, Ahmad Said expressed his gratefulness on his appointment and paid tribute to Idris, an old friend he has known since university, for the work he has done for the Terengganu people so far and to seek his advice. After the swearing in ceremony where the duties are handed over from Idris, he also expressed hopes in moving on to discharge his responsibility to the people and eradicate poverty within the state.<ref>{{cite news |date=30 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title =New Terengganu Menteri Besar Pays Tribute To Idris | publisher= [[Bernama]]| url =http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/state_news/news.php?id=323585&cat=et}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=30 March 2008 |access-date=1 April 2008 |title =Now we close ranks and work for the people | publisher=[[New Straits Times]] | author=ROSLI ZAKARIA  | url =http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2199536/Article/index_html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233207/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2199536/Article/index_html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2 April 2008}}</ref>

===Ethnic groups===

Terengganu is one of Malaysia's most [[homogeneous]] states along with Kelantan. More than 95% of the population is ethnically Malay, but there are other ethnic groups that live in the state as well, including Chinese (mostly Hokkien), Indians (mostly Tamils), Siamese, and Orang Aslis (Batek and Semaq Beri).

====Malays====
Malays are the largest ethnic group in the state with more than 94% of the population. The Malays in Terengganu are distinct from Malays of other parts of the country, they have unique cultures, traditions and spoken language. There are two sub-groups of Malays in the state:

'''Terengganu Malays'''

[[Terengganuan Malay people|Terengganu Malays]] are the majority Malay sub-group in the state. They are the dominant Malay sub-group in all districts of Terengganu except for Besut and northern Setiu. They habitually speak Terengganu Malay language which is distinct but closely related to Kelantanese variety in the north. Terengganu Malays are also known for their rich cultures and traditions, one of the most well known is the [[Ulek Mayang]].

'''Besut Malays'''

Besut Malays are predominantly found in the district of Besut and northern Setiu. Despite being Terengganu citizens, they are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally closer to, and still maintain strong ties with, Kelantan. Most Malays in Besut and northern Setiu speak only Kelantanese, although those who have long been exposed to other districts of Terengganu can speak Terengganuan as well.

====Chinese====
The Chinese Terengganuan form the largest minority ethnic group in the state. They are mostly [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] by ancestry and speak a dialect of [[Hokkien]]. Unlike other parts of Malaysia, the Chinese in Terengganu are much more assimilated; they speak fluent local Malay (Terengganuan in most parts of Terengganu and Kelantanese in Besut) and also share a similar lifestyle. They also have a local Peranakan culture known as "Mek Awang" which is a mixture of Chinese (mostly Hokkien) and Malay (Terengganu Malay) cultures, which can be seen in their cuisine and clothing and their language as well.

====Indian====
Indians in Terengganu are mostly [[Malaysian Tamils|Tamils]] and the majority are adherents of Hinduism, although a minority follow [[Islam]]. Like their Chinese counterparts, the Indian community in Terengganu are highly assimilated, with many fluent in Terengganu Malay along with Tamil, Standard Malay and English. There is one major Hindu temple in Kuala Terengganu. Most Indians in Terengganu live in urban areas like Kuala Terengganu.

====Siamese====
{{main|Malaysian Siamese}}

The Siamese in Terengganu maintain a small but well-organised community. They can be found in Besut and few in Setiu and Kuala Terengganu. Physically, there is little difference between Malays and Siamese other than their name and religion. Their native language is [[Southern Thai language]] but most speak Kelantanese as large numbers of them live in Besut.

====Orang Asli====
The Orang Aslis are the indigenous peoples of Peninsular Malaysia. In Terengganu they can be found mostly in Hulu Terengganu and Besut districts. There are two Orang Asli ethnic groups in Terengganu, the [[Semaq Beri people|Semaq Beri]]s live near [[Lake Kenyir]] or other parts of the district. They belong to [[Senoi]] group. Besides the Semaq Beris, there are also [[Batek people]], a [[Semang]] ethnic group mostly found in interior parts of Terengganu, especially in [[Taman Negara]] area or in other parts of Terengganu. Both Semaq Beris and Bateks still maintain their semi-nomadic lifestyle, although some now live in permanent homes. Both are also speakers of [[Austroasiatic languages]].

===Languages===
The people of Terengganu generally speak Coastal [[Terengganu Malay]], which is distinct from standard Malay and [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay]], except for those in Besut district, [[Perhentian Islands]] and some parts of Setiu where Kelantanese are more dominant. Those that live in [[Hulu Terengganu]] had their own distinct variant but closely related to Coastal Terengganu Malay. Chinese Terengganuans are predominantly [[Hoklo people]] and thus mostly speak [[Hokkien]] as their [[first language]], although a number of [[Malaysian Mandarin|Mandarin]] speakers are increasing. Indians in Terengganu mostly speak [[Malaysian Tamil]]. There is also an [[Orang Asli]] languages such as [[Batek language|Batek]] and [[Semaq Beri language|Semaq Beri]], spoken in inland parts of Terengganu and is part of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]]. There is also a small number of [[Cham language|Cham]] language speakers spoken by a small community of [[Cham people]] in Dungun.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucMEcqxPgu8 | title=#AWANIJr: Bangsa Champa di Kampung Che Lijah, Dungun | website=[[YouTube]] | date=11 January 2018 }}</ref>

==Economy==
Terengganu used to be Malaysia's poorest state until oil and gas were discovered off its coastline in the 80s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PM: Oil and gas industry the backbone of Terengganu's rapid development |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2022/06/04/pm-oil-and-gas-industry-the-backbone-of-terengganu039s-rapid-development |access-date=2023-04-23 |website=The Star |language=en}}</ref> Terengganu's main industry now is [[petroleum]] and gas. There are huge [[petrochemical]] complexes near [[Paka, Malaysia|Paka]] and [[Kerteh]], involving many [[joint venture]]s between the Malaysian national oil company, [[Petronas]], and foreign [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]]. [[Tourism in Terengganu|Tourism]] and fishing are also major industries in Terengganu, a state with a long [[coastline]]. Agriculture also remains important, with [[banana]], [[rambutan]], [[durian]], [[watermelon]], and various other fruits and vegetables available in season. Terengganu was traditionally famous for boatbuilding, with highly decorated carved wooden boats called ''bangau'' to be found in the harbour of every village and town in days not so long gone by, before electric motorboats became standard equipment for the state's fishermen.

Terengganu did not receive many Indian or Chinese migrants, and therefore [[Malay people|Malay]] cultural influences predominate. Traditional pursuits such as kite-flying contests, top-spinning contests, and traditional [[Handicraft|arts & crafts]], such as [[batik]] and [[songket]] are still very much alive. The people of Terengganu have always had a reputation for being socially conservative and devout [[Muslims]].

The major tourist attractions in the state include: [[Kuala Terengganu]], the capital; [[Islamic Heritage Park]], [[Tasik Kenyir]], a large artificial lake; Sekayu Waterfalls; Kuala Ibai Lagoons; Batu Burok Beach, Kemasik Beach, Rantau Abang, [[Setiu Wetlands]], Marang, [[Chukai]] town and several offshore islands such as [[Redang Island|Pulau Redang]], [[Lang Tengah Island|Pulau Lang Tengah]], and [[Kapas Island|Pulau Kapas]], and the [[Perhentian Islands|Pulau Perhentian]], which attract beachgoers and snorkelers because of their picture perfect beaches. Many travellers find the relatively rural and tranquil atmosphere in the state conducive to a relaxing holiday.

Terengganu has recently been known internationally as the host of [[Monsoon Cup]], which was first held in 2005 and then became an annual national sporting event. The event brought millions of [[ringgit]] of investment into the state from the private sectors and Malaysian Government. Tourists flocked to [[Kuala Terengganu]] and Duyong to witness this event, held during the [[monsoon]] season, which had previously been low season for tourism in Terengganu.
