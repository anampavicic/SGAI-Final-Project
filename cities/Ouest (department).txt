'''Ouest''' ([[French language|French]]) or '''Lwès''' ([[Haitian Creole]]; both meaning "West") is one of the ten [[departments of Haiti]]. It is located in south-central Haiti, linking the Great-North and the [[Tiburon Peninsula]].

It is the jurisdictional seat of the national capital, the city of [[Port-au-Prince]].

It has an area of {{convert|4982.56|km2}} and a population of 4,029,705 (2015 estimate), making it both the largest department by area and the most populated department in Haiti.

==History==
===Taino period===
The department was part of the [[Jaragua, Hispaniola|Xaragua kasika]] under the leadership of Anacaona.

There are many native settlements in the department notably around [[Arcahaie, Arcahaie, Ouest|Akaya]], [[Etang Saumâtre|Azuei]] Lake, [[Léogâne|Yaguana]], the [[Gonâve Island|island of Guanabo]] and [[Petit-Goâve|Goava]]. It is understood that the Azuei Plaine region was used as a hunting ground for the natives.

The island of Gonave is the last point of refuge for the Taino natives.

===Spanish period===
One of the only Spanish settlements in the area was a destroyed Spanish town called Santa-Maria-de-la-Paz-Verdadera, the actual city of [[Tabarre]].

===French period===
The earliest French settlement in the area was a hospital named Morne L'Hopital. In the second half of the 18th century, the French wanted to build a new colonial capital outside the troubled North. One of the suggestions was Petit-Goâve but later they chose the region of l'Hopital building which would become the City of [[Port-au-Prince]].

===English period===
In 1793 the city fell to the British troops where they built the Fort-National until Toussaint gained it back for the French government.

===Haitian period===
====Haitian Revolution====
Many [[Maroons|maroon]] troops controlled the mountain around Port-au-Prince mainly [[Romaine-la-Prophétesse|Romaine-la-Prophetesse]] and [[Lamour Desrances|Lamour Dérance]] and Cangé.

Around 1772, [[Romaine-la-Prophétesse]] acquired a plantation named Trou Coffy in the department (likely in what is now [[Fondwa]]), becoming a prominent coffee grower and trader.<ref>{{harvnb|Rey|2017|pp=28, 47, 49}}</ref> In 1791 and 1792, during the early [[Haitian Revolution]], Romaine led some thirteen thousand slaves and rebels in freeing slaves from and burning the provinces plantations and briefly controlling two major cities, [[Léogâne]] and [[Jacmel]].<ref>{{cite book|author-mask=Terry Rey|last=Rey|first=Terry|title=The Priest and the Prophetess: Abbé Ouvière, Romaine Rivière, and the Revolutionary Atlantic World|year=2017|pages=28, 32–35, 48–49, 52}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Matthias Middell|author2=Megan Maruschke|title=The French Revolution as a Moment of Respatialization|year=2019|page=71}}</ref><ref name="Dun 2016 65">{{cite book|author=James Alexander Dun|title=Dangerous Neighbors: Making the Haitian Revolution|year=2016|page=65}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=David F. Marley|title=Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict|year=2008|page=534}}</ref>
Ogé and Chavannes organized more than 300 blacks the Suisses to rebel against their so-called master. Caradeux the rough slave master in the region orderer their execution in [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas|Omòl]].In 1791, Pétion, Pinchinnat, Beauvais, and more rebelled against the French authority and reclaimed their civil rights. After the Battles of Pernier, [[Croix-des-Bouquets]], and [[Mirebalais]] they gained a Concordat, although the slaves did not gain anything.

In Arcahaie, on May 18, 1803, the generals of the North and West and Maroons met for a Congress and chose [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] as commander of the [[Armée Indigène]]s and chose the [[Flag of Haiti|Haiti Flag]] designed by [[Catherine Flon]].

====Independence====
According to [[Thomas Madiou]]'s recount of the Haitian Revolution, the fight for [[Port-au-Prince]] is one of the most important fights. After Gabart gained control of [[Saint-Marc|St-Marc]], the entire [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]] region was under the control of [[Dessalines (disambiguation)|Dessalines]] and the [[Armée Indigène]]. In the south, only the major port town of [[Les Cayes]] was still under French control. In the north, [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Haitian]] and [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas|Mole-St-Nicolas]] are still under French control. [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] anticipated that the next step for [[Dessalines (disambiguation)|Dessalines]] would be the conquer of Port-au-Prince, so he moved the capital of the colony back to [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Francois]] which would be harder for the British Navy to put under blockade versus Port-au-Prince located in the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Gulf of Gonave]]. Leaving [[Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite|Petite-Rivière-de-l'Artibonite]] on September 15, the general stopped in St-Marc by [[Armée Indigène|Gabart]] and was in [[Arcahaie]] by [[Alexandre Pétion|Pétion]] on September 17. The same night for [[Croix-des-Bouquets]] where he camped by Frère. Pétion continued to march toward [[Port-au-Prince|P-au-P]] and was by habitation Drouillard the next day. The French general of Croix-des-Bouquets Lux left the arrondissement to go help the French troops in P-au-P, he passed by Damien, Sarthe and the convoy was attacked by the Indigènes. By September 23, [[Armée Indigène|Cangé]] left [[Léogâne|Léogane]], marched toward Port-au-Prince, and attacked the Fort-Bizoton in [[Carrefour, Ouest|Carrefour]], Gabart was at the St-Joseph gate and Dessalines camped in Turgeau a neighborhood located east of the city. The city of Port-au-Prince is officially sieged by the Armée Indigénes. The very next day Pétion was located in the habitation Philippeaux and started bombarding the French troops. By October 5, an [[aide-de-camp]] of [[Jean Parisot de Valette|Lavalette]] brought a letter to Dessalines with the terms of their capitulation. Dessalines accepted with an exchange of prisoners and [[Adjutant general|adjuvant-general]] Bonnet came back to the Haitians and gave the French 4 days to leave the city. Thus on September 9 Port-au-Prince was freed from the French troops and Dessalines enter the city proudly with Pétion on his right and Gabart on his left. 
 
[[Alexandre Pétion|Pétion]], [[Armée Indigène|Germain Frère]] and [[Armée Indigène|Yayou]] are signatories of the [[Haitian Declaration of Independence]].
Ouest was part of the Second Military Division of the West with Pétion as commander.

Pétion build the twin forts [https://visithaiti.com/things-to-do/fort-jacques/ Jacques and Alexandre] on the order of Dessalines.

On October 17, 1806, coming from [[Dessalines]]ville, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Emperor Jacques 1st]] was ambushed and assassinated plunging the country into a civil war. His body was buried in St-Anne Cemetery. On January 2, 1904, he received state funerals and later on his body was moved to the Autel de la Patrie in Champs-de-Mars along with [[Alexandre Pétion|Pétion']]s body.

On January 1, 1807, only three years after the [[Haitian Declaration of Independence]], the northern troops fought the western troops in the Sibert Battle, where Pétion almost died. [[Cabaret, Ouest|Cabaret]] was the de facto border between the two states.

Under [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], fearing the return of the French boat, he ordered the construction of a city in the heights like Toussaint with [[Ennery, Artibonite|Ennery]], Dessalines with [[Dessalines]] and Christophe with [[Milot, Haiti|Milot]] and naming it after his mentor [[Pétion-Ville|Pétionville]].

Being the political center of the country, most of Haiti's political instability and economical fight happen in the Port-au-Prince area since 1749 until today.

==Geography==
The department is bordered to the north by [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]] and [[Centre (department)|Centre]] and the [[Geography of Haiti|Mattheux mountain chain]], the west by the Gulf of Gonave, the south by the Sud-Est department and the [[Geography of Haiti|La Selle Mountain Chain]], and the [[Dominican Republic]] to the east through the province of [[Independencia Province|Independencia]].

It is the second largest department in Haiti after [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]]. [[Gonâve Island]] is also part of the Ouest department. The department's stretch of coastline lies entirely in the [[Gulf of Gonâve]].

A part majority of the department lies in the [[Plain of the Cul-de-Sac|Plaine-de-Cul-de-Sac]] which continues to the Dominican Rep. as the [[Enriquillo wetlands|Hayo de Enriquillo]]. Two other plains that lie in the region are the Plain of Arcahaie-Cabaret and the [[Geography of Haiti|Plain of Léoganes]].

===Gulf and coast===
The Golfe is more than 500&nbsp;km in length from Mole-Saint-Nicolas to Abricots and it consists of more than a dozen bays and harbors. 
The Bay of Port-au-Prince is the largest in the country and one of the biggest in the Caribbean harboring many islands, cays, and reefs. The island of Gonave is the largest
satellite island on Hispaniola being the size of [[Singapore]].

===Environment===
The largest lake in the country is a salty lake in a depression in the plain of the same name, Azuei Lake. A smaller lake lies next to it Caiman Lake. Both lakes form a national park harboring [[flamingo]]s and [[caiman]]s.

The hills of Port-au-Prince consist of a mountain from the [[Chaîne de la Selle|Massif de la Selle]]-[[Geography of the Dominican Republic|Cordillera Meridional]], where one can find multiple forests such as Foret-des-Pins and Parc-la-Visite.

The most important rivers in the department are Blanche River, Froide River, Monance River, and Bois-de-Chène Ravine.

===Geology===
The earthquake activities in the area are a result of the [[Enriquillo–Plantain Garden fault zone|Enriquillo-Plantain-Garden]] fault going from [[Jamaica]] to the [[Dominican Republic|Dominican Rep]] passing through the [[Tiburon Peninsula|Xaragua Peninsula]] and the [[Gonâve Microplate|Gonave Microplate]]. Two well-documented earthquakes happen in the area.
* 1751 earthquake
* [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]] or ''Goudougoudou''. The epicenter was in Léoganes affecting [[Jacmel]], [[Léogâne|Léoganes]], and Port-au-Prince and causing millions in damages and counting hundreds-thousand of casualties.

{{main|2010 Haiti earthquake}}

On 12 January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck in the department, the largest in Haiti in two centuries.<ref>{{cite news|work=CNN News Morning|date=13 January 2010}}</ref> In the [[Port-au-Prince Arrondissement]], many areas suffered damage.<ref>{{cite news|work=CNN|title=The Situation Room|date=15 January 2010}}</ref> In the [[Léogâne Arrondissement]], the city of [[Léogâne]] suffered 80-90% destruction.<ref name=NoOther>{{cite web|work=ABC News|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/17/2794043.htm?section=justin|title=Haiti Disaster Like "No Other"|publisher=AFP|author=Lisa Millar|date=17 January 2010|access-date=17 January 2010}}</ref> Other places{{which|date=March 2021}} in Léogâne were also affected.

==Economy==
Ouest is the wealthiest department in Haiti, with economic poles in different sectors.

===Tourism===
Ouest's tourism sector touches on different branches such as leisure tourism in the Cotes-des-Arcadins, [[List of national parks of Haiti|eco-tourism]] with Park Azuei-Caiman and Park La Selle, historical tourism with the countless historical monuments especially the [[Musée du Panthéon National Haïtien|National Museum]], and cultural tourism.

===Agriculture===
For many years, agriculture was a part of the economy of the department, with the Arcahaie plain being a center for [[Cooking banana|plantain]], the Cul-de-Sac and Léogane being known for large [[Sugarcane|sugar-cane]] plantations mostly for the production of [[rum]], and the hills of [[Kenscoff]] cultivating different vegetables. Unfortunately, over-construction and the ever-expansion of the city, those areas see their fertile land now covered with asphalt and concrete.

===Transport===
Much of Haiti's road network extends out of Ouest.
*The RN1 connects the West to the North by the coast
*The RN2 connects the West to the South
*The RN3 connects the West to the North through the mountains
*The RN4 connects the West to the South-East
*The RN8 connects the West to the [[Jimaní|Jimani]], in the Dominican Rep.

The bay harbors many ports of sizable capacity owned or operated by the state or private parties.

Haiti's largest airport, the [[Toussaint Louverture International Airport|Toussaint Louverture Airport]], is located in [[Delmas, Ouest|Delmas]].

==Administrative divisions==
The Department of Ouest is subdivided into five [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]]s, which are further subdivided into twenty [[Communes of Haiti|communes]].
