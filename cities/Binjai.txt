==History==
The origin of Binjai when it established itself as a city is unknown. Historically, the Binjai area was situated between two Malay kingdoms, [[Deli (sultanate)|Deli]] and [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]]. Binjai grew from a small village on the edge of the [[Bingai River]].

According to both oral and written accounts of the history of the area, the city of Binjai grew from a small village located on the edge of the Bingai River, approximately where the Pekan Binjai village is located today. Traditional ceremonies were held to lay the foundations of the small village in the shade of a large [[Jack (Tree)|binjai tree]] at the edge of the Bingai River, which flows into the [[Wampu River]], which is navigable for a large portion of its length.

Around the tree were built several houses, which were gradually enlarged, until finally a village hall was built. A lively port also developed, visited by barges from [[Stabat]], [[Tanjung Pura]], and [[Strait of Malacca|the Strait of Malacca]]. Over time, the Binjai tree gave its name to the growing city.

==Geography==
Binjai is located between the [[Mencirim River, Bangkatan River|Mencirim, Bangkatan]], and Bingai rivers. On average, it is 28 m above sea level. As the crow flies, Binjai is only 8&nbsp;km from Medan, although [[Kabupaten]] Deli Serdang separates the two. However, the route of the Sumatara Highway increases the effective distance between the two cities to 22&nbsp;km.

The two nearby rivers, the Bingai and Mencirim Rivers satisfy the needs of the city for clean water, which is distributed by the local water company. However,  on wells for their water supply.

==Climate==
