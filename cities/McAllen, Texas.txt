'''McAllen''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] and the most populous city in [[Hidalgo County, Texas|Hidalgo County]]. It is located at the southern tip of the state in the [[Rio Grande Valley (Texas)|Rio Grande Valley]], on the [[Mexico–United States border]]. The city limits extend south to the [[Rio Grande]], across from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Reynosa]]. McAllen is about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], McAllen's population was 142,210,<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/McAllen_city,_Texas?g=160XX00US4845384 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 17, 2023}}</ref> making it the [[List of cities in Texas by population|23rd-most populous]] city in [[Texas]]. It is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area ([[McAllen–Edinburg–Mission metropolitan area|McAllen–Edinburg–Mission]]) in the state of Texas, and the binational [[Reynosa–McAllen|Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan area]] counts a population of more than 1.5 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=McAllen Overview |url=http://www.mcallen.org/Business-Community/McAllen-Overview |publisher=McAllen Chamber of Commerce |access-date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>

From its settlement in 1904, the area around McAllen was largely rural and agricultural in character, but the latter half of the 20th century had steady growth, which has continued in the 21st century in the metropolitan area. The introduction of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' economy and the [[North American Free Trade Association]] led to an increase in cross-border trading with Mexico.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bogan |first=Jesse |title=A Boom at the Border |magazine=Forbes |date=April 2, 2009 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/01/mexico-texas-economy-business-border.html |access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of McAllen, Texas}}
In 1904, the Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (now the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] reached the Santa Anita Ranch. John McAllen and his son James had donated land to the railroad to guarantee it would cross this area. On December 5, 1904, the McAllen Townsite Company was formed by Uriah Lott, Leonidas C. Hill Sr., John McAllen, James Ballí McAllen, and John J. Young. The new community, which was named for John McAllen, had the depot nearest the county seat, [[Hidalgo, Texas|Hidalgo]], {{convert|8|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south.

By 1911, {{convert|5000|acre|abbr=on}} were under cultivation in East McAllen: commodity crops of cotton, alfalfa, [[broom corn]], citrus fruits, grapes, and figs were raised. East McAllen had an estimated population of 1,000 that year, and West McAllen had ceased to exist. In 1911, the town applied for and was issued a charter of incorporation under the name McAllen. In 1916, 20,000 New York state troops were stationed at McAllen to help quell [[Border War (1910–1919)|border disturbances]] related to the Mexican Civil War. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 1,200 in 1916 to 6,000 in 1920.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garza |first=Alicia A. |title=McAllen |publisher=Handbook of Texas Online |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdm01 |access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref>

McAllen adopted a [[home rule]] charter in 1927. Canning factories, a winery, tortilla plants, wood-working plants, and some oil exploration increased the population to 9,074 by 1930. In 1936, Hiram Garner opened the Valley Distillery, Incorporated, which produced wines from citrus juices. The town was a petroleum and [[Chemurgy|farm chemurgic center]] with a population of 11,877 in 1940, by which time it had adopted the nickname "The City of Palms". In 1941, a [[suspension bridge]] replaced the old bridge from Hidalgo to Reynosa in [[Tamaulipas]]; the new toll bridge was purchased by McAllen and was named the [[McAllen–Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge]]. Its construction resulted in increased tourist trade, making McAllen a winter resort and port of entry to Mexico.

The discovery of oil in the Reynosa area in 1947 attracted a large migration of people from the Mexican interior to jobs in the region. They both constituted a new tourist market and a cheap labor supply for McAllen. The sister cities were linked as a result of the increased traffic between them. The population of McAllen was 20,005 in 1950 and 32,728 in 1960. In 1954 the McAllen–Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge was the number-two port of entry into Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=McAllen-Hidalgo-Reynosa Bridge |publisher=Texas Department of Transportation |url=http://www.txdot.gov/project_information/projects/border_crossing/mcallen.htm |access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref>

McAllen was an agricultural, oil, and tourist center in 1970, when the population reached 37,636. By the start of the 1970s, McAllen had a 200-bed hospital and a new air-conditioned high school, the first school in the nation featuring on-site power generated by [[natural gas]]-powered turbines. The tourism industry continued to expand as people traveled to the area from both Mexico and the northern United States. The population continued to grow steadily through the 1970s, and reached 66,281 by 1980. During the late 1980s, the McAllen Foreign Trade Zone was an important general-purpose [[foreign trade zone]].<ref>{{cite web|title=City History |publisher=City of McAllen |url=http://www.mcallen.net/info/history.aspx |access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref> At the time, McAllen's main industries were retail, tourism and farming, and each was in trouble. The devaluation of the [[Mexican peso]] in the 1980s put a damper on cross-border shopping; local tourism was down because of the [[early 1980s recession|recession]]. In 1983, a freeze took out much of the valley's citrus crop.

In the mid-1980s, fueled by trade and the growth of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' (in which components are shipped to Mexico from the United States, assembled, and shipped back as finished products), the economy began to improve in Hidalgo County. McAllen sits across the border from Reynosa, a large manufacturing center. After the peso devalued, Mexico was more successful in attracting companies to run their plants in Mexico, with support operations in Texas.

Border crossing is a daily event for many and is a key component in the local economy.{{r|LAT 2019-03-21}} The city became a focal point for concerns about the border during the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019]] over the [[Mexico–United States barrier]]. President Donald Trump held a briefing with the [[United States Border Patrol|border agents]] at the patrol station here in January 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-visits-u-s-mexico-border-as-shutdown-talks-stall|title=Trump highlights human trafficking as he calls for 'strong barrier' during visit to US-Mexico border|first=Alex|last=Pappas|date=January 10, 2019|work=Fox News|access-date=January 11, 2019}}</ref> Homeland Security Secretary [[Kirstjen Nielsen]] also visited the Border Patrol station in March 2019. In order to deal with [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States|overcrowded facilities in 2019]] resulting from the arrival of [[Central American migrant caravans]], immigration authorities were releasing a few hundred [[asylum seekers]] daily to private groups that assist them with basic needs and travel arrangements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2019/03/23/desperate-migrant-families-overwhelm-border-agencies/3238701002/|title=Desperate migrant families overwhelm border agencies|last=Merchant|first=Nomaan|date=March 23, 2019|website=[[Ventura County Star]]|language=en|access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref>

The McAllen city limits extend to the southwest as far as the Rio Grande, directly north of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. The [[Anzalduas International Bridge]] crosses the Rio Grande at this point, {{convert|11|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of downtown McAllen.

McAllen is {{convert|238|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[San Antonio]], {{convert|158|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], {{convert|148|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], {{convert|60|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], and {{convert|150|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Monterrey]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|126.0|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|125.2|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.8|km2|order=flip|1}}, or 0.62%, is covered by water.<ref name="Census 2010">{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4845384| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001): McAllen city, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| access-date=February 15, 2018| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213113333/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4845384| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Although McAllen is named the "City of Palms", [[Tropics|tropical]] vegetation is only locally dominant. Many thorny [[shrub]]s and [[deciduous]] trees occur in the area, such as the Rio Grande ash (''[[Fraxinus berlandieriana]]''), cedar elm (''[[Ulmus crassifolia]]''), and honey mesquite (''[[Prosopis glandulosa]]'').

===Climate===
McAllen, like much of [[South Texas]], has a [[subtropical climate]].<ref>[[Voy:Rio Grande Valley|Rio Grande Valley]]. Wikivoyage.</ref> Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], the city features a hot [[semiarid climate]] (BSh), featuring long, very hot and humid summers, and brief, warm winters. The city has two distinct seasons; a [[wet season]] from May to October and a [[dry season]] from November to April. The normal monthly mean temperature ranges from {{convert|62.8|F|1}} in January to {{convert|89.3|F|1}} in August.<ref name= "NOWData NWS Brownsville, TX (BRO)"/> The warm season is extremely long, as average high temperatures from May through September are above {{convert|90|F}} and average low temperatures are above {{Convert|70|F}}, with relatively high [[dew point]] values, resulting in higher [[relative humidity]] values and [[heat index]] values. Heat indices consistently reach over {{convert|110|F}} during these months. Winter temperatures in McAllen and surrounding Rio Grande Valley are some of the warmest in the [[contiguous United States]] outside of [[South Florida]], and comparable to the [[Coachella Valley|Coachella]] and [[Imperial Valley|Imperial]] valleys and [[Yuma Desert]], but with warmer nighttime lows and higher [[Dewpoint|dew points]].

Average annual precipitation is {{convert|22.31|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}}. Most precipitation occurs in the warm season, with the least precipitation distinctly occurring in the cooler winter. As September is the peak of the north [[Atlantic hurricane season]] and tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally drop copious amounts of rainfall on the region, this month tends by far to be the wettest, averaging {{convert|4.74|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain. The driest month is February, with only {{convert|0.66|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation. Since 1941, it has snowed twice, once when the city received {{convert|1.7|in|abbr=on}} on [[2004 Christmas Eve United States winter storm|December 25, 2004]].<ref name= "NOWData NWS Brownsville, TX (BRO)"/>

Temperatures consistently rise above {{convert|100|F}} from June through August, with exceptionally high humidity. The highest temperature ever recorded in McAllen was {{convert|111|F}}, set on June 22, 2017 and May 9, 2024. The lowest temperature ever recorded in McAllen was {{convert|13|F}}, on January 12, 1962.<ref name= "NOWData NWS Brownsville, TX (BRO)"/>

While usually a hot, humid, but relatively dry climate, McAllen, Texas has received unusual weather phenomena. In 2013, McAllen, Texas received a large hail storm that destroyed many vehicles and buildings. The storm came suddenly and many people were unprepared. In December 2017, McAllen received almost 3 inches of snow, nearly 13 years after the previous snowfall which took place during the [[2004 Christmas Eve United States winter storm]]. In February 2021, McAllen reached record low temperatures between {{Convert|10|F}} and {{Convert|20|F}} and lost power, heat, and water for a week due to [[Winter Storm Uri]]. In addition to these fluke weather events, McAllen is prone to tropical storms, hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Dolly (2008)]] and [[Hurricane Hanna (2020)]], and heatwaves.

===Health===
McAllen was the focus of a 2009 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' by [[Atul Gawande]] entitled "The Cost Conundrum", an inquiry into the factors that contribute to the cost of health care. The McAllen area had the highest taxpayer-sponsored spending per beneficiary in the United States, despite areas with similar demographics and health profiles having half the cost per recipient. The article noted that while the area has a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes, its rates of [[infant mortality]], [[HIV]], and [[tobacco use]] were lower than the national average.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum |title=The Cost Conundrum |date=May 25, 2009 |access-date=December 16, 2017 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |last1=Gawande |first1=Atul }}</ref>

McAllen was the most [[obesity|obese]] metropolitan area in the country in 2012, with 38.5% of the adult population considered obese. The high obesity rate has likely contributed to area residents' poor health. More than 21% of the population has been diagnosed with [[diabetes]], more than any other metro area in the United States. Poverty may play a large role in the community's health problems, as well. Over 25% of the city population was living below the poverty line during the period 2012–2016.<ref name="DP03"/> More than 29% of the population also lacked health coverage during that time.<ref name="DP03"/>

==Economy==
The [[Rio Grande Valley (Texas)|Rio Grande Valley]] began its rapid development with the introduction of [[irrigation]] in 1898 and the construction of the railroad in 1904. These major additions turned a once relatively desolate area into a major agricultural center. Throughout much of the 1900s, McAllen was a rural, agriculture-based economy characterized by sporadic growth.

Today, the area is transforming into a major international trade area. As recently as 1990, McAllen's unemployment rate was at 22.6%. By the end of 2005, that figure had dropped to 7.7%. However, in 2011, census.gov listed the McAllen metro area the poorest in the nation.<ref>Martha C.

===Trade===
Since the 1980s and especially since the ratification of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] in 1994, the focal point of economic activity has shifted from agriculture to international trade, health care, retail, and tourism.

The McAllen Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) is located south of McAllen between McAllen and Reynosa. Commissioned in 1973, it was the first inland [[Foreign-trade zones of the United States|foreign-trade zone]] in the United States. Also, an FTZ designation site is at the [[McAllen Miller International Airport]] to facilitate air cargo needs. Under U.S. and Mexican laws and NAFTA provisions, the FTZ designation offers specific cost-saving opportunities to manufacturers. Products can be brought into the FTZ duty-free. Services have recently expanded to include full logistic support services, including public warehouse services such as pick and pack, order processing, inventory control, incoming/outgoing quality inspection, and kitting.<ref>{{cite web |title= Rio Grande Valley |publisher= Texas Border Business |url= http://www.texasborderbusiness.com/About/Rio-Grande-Valley |access-date=November 21, 2011}}</ref>
