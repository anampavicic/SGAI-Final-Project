In the [[Pre-colonialism|pre-colonial]] period, the area that is now Gombe State was split up between various states until the early 1800s when the [[Fulani jihad]] seized much of the area and formed the [[Gombe Emirate]] under the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. In the 1910s, [[British Empire|British]] expeditions occupied the [[Emirate]] and the surrounding areas, incorporating them into the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]] before becoming independent as [[Nigeria]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ikimáº¹ |first1=Obaro |title=The British in Bauchi, 1901-1908: an episode in the British occupation and control of Northern Nigeria |journal=Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria |date=June 1974 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=271â€“290 |jstor=41857013 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41857013 |access-date=24 December 2021}}</ref> Originally, modern-day Gombe State was a part of the post-independence [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[North-Eastern State]]. After the North-Eastern State was split, [[Bauchi State]] was formed in 1976 alongside ten other states. Twenty years afterwards, a group of LGAs in Bauchi's west were broken off to form the new Gombe State.

Economically, Gombe State is largely based around [[agriculture]], mainly of [[sorghum]], [[maize]], [[Peanut|groundnuts]], [[millet]], [[Bean|beans]], [[rice]] and [[Tomato|tomatoes]]. Other key industries are services, especially in the city of [[Gombe, Nigeria|Gombe]], and the herding of [[Camel|camels]], [[cattle]], [[Goat|goats]], and [[sheep]]. Gombe has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|fourth lowest]] [[Human Development Index]] and [[List of Nigerian states by GDP|one of the lowest]] [[GDP]]s in the country.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021 |archive-date=14 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314102820/https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

'''Afforestation'''

The Gombe State Government has started a four million tree planting programme as part of a renewed effort to stop [[deforestation]] in the North Central Zone.

It is anticipated that the four-year plan, which would be implemented in parts, will last. The first part of the scheme has already seen the government plant 1.3 million tree saplings.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=17 August 2020 |title=Gombe to tackle deforestation with four million trees |url=https://guardian.ng/property/gombe-to-tackle-deforestation-with-four-million-trees/ |access-date=15 July 2023 |website=The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nnorth-east/402511-governor-yahaya-launches-second-phase-of-gombe-goes-green-project.html?tztc=1 |access-date=15 July 2023 |website=www.premiumtimesng.com|title=Governor Yahaya launches second phase of â€˜Gombe Goes Greenâ€™ project|author=Nasir Ayitogo|date=12 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Nejo |first=Abiodun |date=27 March 2023 |title=Groups advocate renewed interest in tree planting |url=https://punchng.com/groups-advocate-renewed-interest-in-tree-planting/ |access-date=15 July 2023 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref> 

'''Flood Control'''

As a result of these studies, the state government has taken preventive steps to lessen the impact of the impending floods and other environmental problems that are expected to hit the state.

In order to protect people and property while minimizing the effects of upcoming weather events and their potentially fatal consequences, Governor [[Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya|Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya]] has ordered the Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources to coordinate with pertinent stakeholders and activate state emergency response and management resources.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Michael |first=Ishola |date=4 July 2023 |title=3 LGAs in Gombe at high risk of flooding, NiMet, NHSA warn |url=https://tribuneonlineng.com/3-lgas-in-gombe-at-high-risk-of-flooding-nimet-nhsa-warn/ |access-date=15 July 2023 |website=Tribune Online |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Azubuike |first=Chima |date=25 September 2022 |title=Flood displaces over 500 in Gombe communities |url=https://punchng.com/flood-displaces-over-500-in-gombe-communities/ |access-date=15 July 2023 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref>
