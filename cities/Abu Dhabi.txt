The city is situated on a T-shaped island, extending into the Gulf from the central-western coast of the UAE.

Abu Dhabi is located on an island in the [[Persian Gulf]], off the Central West Coast.

Abu Dhabi houses local and federal government offices and is the home of the [[Federal National Council|United Arab Emirates Government]] and the [[Supreme Petroleum Council|Supreme Council for Financial and Economic Affairs]]. The city is home to the [[President of the United Arab Emirates|UAE's President]], a member of the [[Al Nahyan family]]. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and [[urbanisation]], coupled with the massive oil and gas reserves and production and relatively high average income, have transformed it into a large, developed metropolis. It is the country's centre of [[politics]] and [[Industrial sector|industry]], and a major [[culture]] and [[commerce]] center. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $503&nbsp;billion UAE economy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Abu Dhabi economy grows 5.2 pct in 2013, slower than expected|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/abu-dhabi-economy-grows-52-pct-in-2013-slower-than-expected-1.1342773|access-date=2020-12-25|website=gulfnews.com|date=3 June 2014 |language=en|archive-date=26 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126113237/https://gulfnews.com/business/abu-dhabi-economy-grows-52-pct-in-2013-slower-than-expected-1.1342773|url-status=live}}</ref>

The area surrounding Abu Dhabi abounds in archaeological evidence from historical civilisations, such as the [[Umm Al Nar culture|Umm Al Nar Culture]], which dates back to the third millennium BC. Other settlements were also found farther outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi, including the [[Al Ain Region|eastern]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Potts |first=Daniel |title=Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates |year=2003 |publisher=Trident Press}}</ref> and [[Al Gharbia, Abu Dhabi|western]] regions of the Emirate.<ref name="DCTAD2017">{{citation |work=[[Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism|Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi]] |title=Annual Report 2017 |volume=1 |page=119 |url=https://tcaabudhabi.ae/DataFolder/reports/2017%20Annual%20report%20-%20EN.pdf |year=2017 |access-date=2019-03-09 |archive-date=8 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221208203506/https://tcaabudhabi.ae/DataFolder/reports/2017%20Annual%20report%20-%20EN.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> On December 2, 1971, Abu Dhabi, along with six other emirates, formed the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]]. This union was marked by the establishment of a federal government and the appointment of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as the first President of the UAE.

=== Etymology ===
"Abu" is Arabic for father, and "Dhabi" is the Arabic word for [[gazelle]]. ''[[Ab (Semitic)|Abu]] Dhabi'' means "Father of Gazelle." It is thought that this name came about because of the abundance of gazelles in the area and a folk tale involving [[Shakhbut bin Dhiyab al Nahyan]].<ref name="name" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uae-tour.com/ |title=United Arab Emirates |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721122534/http://uae-tour.com/ |archive-date=21 July 2013}}</ref>

=== Origins of Al Nahyan ===

The [[Bani Yas]] was originally centered on the [[Liwa Oasis]] in the Emirate's western region. This tribe was the most significant in the area, having over 20 subsections. In 1793, the ruling ''Al Bu Falah'' subsection migrated to the island of Abu Dhabi on the coast of the Persian Gulf due to the discovery of fresh water there. The genealogically senior family within this section was the [[Al Nahyan family|Nahyan family]], which is now the ruling family of Abu Dhabi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bani Yas |url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020194213/http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |archive-date=20 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Who plays a significant role in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), has a notable history that achieved several centuries. Over the 19th and early 20th centuries [[Al Nahyan family]] became the ruling family of Abu Dhabi and played a central role in the governance and development of the emirate. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has played a vital role in transforming the emirate of Abu Dhabi into a hub for culture and creative pursuits in the Arab world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Abdulla |first=Nasreen |title=Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan transformed Abu Dhabi into cultural hub |url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/sheikh-mohamed-bin-zayed-al-nahyan-transformed-abu-dhabi-into-cultural-hub?_refresh=true |access-date=2024-09-25 |website=Khaleej Times |language=en}}</ref>

=== Pearl trade ===
The pearl diving business was a key industry prior to the discovery of oil reserves. According to a source about pearling, the [[Persian Gulf]] was the best location for pearls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://traveltips.usatoday.com/pearl-diving-united-arab-emirates-27520.html|title=Pearl Diving in the United Arab Emirates|website=Travel Tips – USA Today|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07|archive-date=18 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230418144200/https://traveltips.usatoday.com/pearl-diving-united-arab-emirates-27520.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The pearl industry boomed from the late 19th century through to the second decade of the 20th century, however it is believed to date back around 7,000 years. Pearl divers dive for one to three minutes and would have dived as many as thirty times per day. Air tanks and any other sort of mechanical device were forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big toes to protect them while they searched for oysters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Trench |first=Richard |title=Arab Gulf Cities |year=1995 |publisher=Archive International Group |location=Oxford}}</ref> The divers were not paid for a day's work but received a portion of the season's earnings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pearl Diving |url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020194213/http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |archive-date=20 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are three main journey  of pear divers happen between the 5th and 9th month each year. Summer was the busiest time. Pearl divers made very deep dives, about 50 dives were made a day, each about 3 minutes long.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Butalia |first=Nivriti |title=11 facts about pearl diving in the UAE |url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/11-facts-about-pearl-diving-in-the-uae |access-date=2024-09-25 |website=Khaleej Times |language=en}}</ref>

=== Trucial coast ===
In the 19th century, as a result of treaties (known as "truces" which gave the coast its name) entered into between [[Great Britain]] and the [[sheikh]]s of the Arab States of the [[Persian Gulf]], Britain became the predominant influence in the area.<ref>[http://www.eceme.ensino.eb.br/cihm/Arquivos/PDF%20Files/99.pdf Trucial Gulf Sheikdoms and Great Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624113052/http://www.eceme.ensino.eb.br/cihm/Arquivos/PDF%20Files/99.pdf |date=24 June 2013 }}</ref> The main purpose of British interest was to protect the trade route to India from pirates, hence, the earlier name for the area, the "[[Piracy in the Persian Gulf|Pirate Coast]]". After the suppression of piracy, other considerations came into play, such as a strategic need of the British to exclude other powers from the region. Following their withdrawal from India in the year 1947, the British maintained their influence in Abu Dhabi as interest in the oil potential of the Persian Gulf grew.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Michael Quentin |title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates |date=February 2016 |publisher=Reaktion Books |location=London |isbn=978-1-78023-580-6 |page=151 |url=http://greenmountainpress.co.uk/keepersgoldenshore.html |access-date=17 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118043448/http://greenmountainpress.co.uk/keepersgoldenshore.html |archive-date=18 November 2016}}</ref>

=== First oil discoveries ===
In the mid to late 1930s, as the pearl trade declined, interest grew in the oil possibilities of the region. On 5 January 1936, [[Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company|Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Ltd (PDTC)]], an associate company of the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], entered into a concession agreement with the ruler, [[Sheikh]] [[Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], to explore for oil. This was followed by a seventy-five-year concession signed in January 1939. However, owing to the desert terrain, inland exploration was fraught with difficulties. In 1953, D'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of [[BP]], obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession: Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA) was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]). In 1958, using a marine drilling platform, the ADMA Enterprise, oil was discovered in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about {{convert|8755|ft|m|disp=flip}}. This was followed in 1959 by PDTC's onshore discovery well at Murban No.3.<ref name="AB">Morton, Michael Quentin, "The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries", GEO Expro article, issue 3, 2011.[http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Abu_Dhabi_Oil_Discoveries/a3b23f12.aspx GEO ExPro – The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217233022/http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Abu_Dhabi_Oil_Discoveries/a3b23f12.aspx |date=17 February 2012 }}</ref>

ADMA discovered the [[Bu Hasa oil field]] in 1962 and the [[Lower Zakum oil field]] in 1963. Today, in addition to the oil fields mentioned, the main producing fields onshore are Asab, Sahil and Shah, and offshore are al-Bunduq, and Abu al-Bukhoosh.<ref name="AB" /> In 1966 Dubai made its first oil discovery with the offshore Fateh oil<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dorcheus |first=S.M. |last2=Landis |first2=S.R. |last3=Robertson |first3=C.A. |date=March 1995 |title=Fateh Field Production Facility Reconfiguration Project |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2523/29845-ms |journal=Proceedings of Middle East Oil Show |publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers |doi=10.2523/29845-ms}}</ref> field and the revenue from oil played a crucial role in the early development of the emirate.

== Geography ==
[[File:Abu Dhabi. 27 January 2019. European Space Agency. Copernicus. Sentinel-2.jpg|thumb|Abu Dhabi seen from [[Sentinel-2]], [[European Space Agency]]]]

The city of Abu Dhabi is on the south[[Eastern Arabia|eastern side]] of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], adjoining the [[Persian Gulf]]. It is on an island less than {{convert|250|m|-1}} from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and [[Mussafah]] Bridges. A third, [[Sheikh Zayed Bridge]], designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], opened in late 2010. Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to [[Saadiyat Island]] by a five-lane motorway bridge. Al-Mafraq bridge connects the city to [[Al Reem Island|Reem Island]] and was completed in early 2011. This is a multi-layer interchange bridge and it has 27 lanes which allow roughly 25,000 automobiles to move per hour. There are three major bridges in the project, the largest has eight lanes, four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abu Dhabi Municipality {{!}} Media Center|url=http://www.adm.gov.ae/|work=Municipality of Abu Dhabi City|access-date=7 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202175555/http://www.adm.gov.ae/|archive-date=2 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Abu Dhabi has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Sunny blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months of June through September are generally extremely hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, mainly occurring during the peak summer months of July and August. During this time, sandstorms occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sandstorms-sweep-across-region |title=Sandstorms sweep across region |first=Gregor |last=McClenaghan |date=13 February 2009 |newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] | location=Abu Dhabi, UAE |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203081319/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sandstorms-sweep-across-region |archive-date=3 December 2012 }}</ref> Due to high humidity, especially in coastal areas, the heat index (or “feels-like” temperature) can be significantly higher than the actual air temperature. Dust storms are common during the hot, dry months, affecting air quality and visibility.[[File:Umm Al Nar Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Decorated stone cup from [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar site]], Abu Dhabi on display at the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]]|alt=]]The cooler season is from November to March, which ranges between moderately hot to mild. This period also sees dense fog on some days and a few days of rain. On average, January is the coolest month of the year, while August is the hottest. Since the Tropic of Cancer passes through the emirate, the southern part falls within the [[Tropics]]. However, despite the coolest month having an {{convert|18.8|C|F}} average, its climate is far too dry to be classed as tropical.

The Ruler of Abu Dhabi appoints the [[Abu Dhabi Executive Council]] to lead the day-to-day management of government affairs. The [[Department of Municipal Affairs (Abu Dhabi)|Department of Municipal Affairs]] is responsible for municipal affairs for the entire emirate.

The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque represents a key fixture of the city's architectural patrimony. Its construction was initiated under the administration of the late President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, a key figure in the foundation of the modern United Arab Emirates.<ref name="szgmc.ae">[SZGMC www.szgmc.ae SZGMC]</ref>

The mosque was constructed with materials from countries around the world, including [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Morocco]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Greece]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.szgmc.ae/en/theory-and-implementation |title=Theory & Implementation – Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212081541/http://www.szgmc.ae/en/theory-and-implementation |archive-date=12 February 2015}}</ref> More than 3,000 workers and 38 contracting companies took part in the construction of the [[mosque]]. Consideration of durability motivated the choice of many materials specified in the design of the structure. These materials include marble, stone, gold, [[semi-precious]] stones, crystals, and ceramics. Construction began on 5 November 1996. The building is large enough to safely contain a maximum of approximately 41,000 people. The overall structure is {{convert|22412|m2|lk=out|abbr=off}}. The internal prayer halls were initially opened in December 2007.<ref name="szgmc.ae" />

As one of the most visited buildings in the UAE, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center was established to manage the day-to-day operations, as a place of worship and Friday gathering and as a center of learning and discovery through its education and visitor programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.szgmc.ae/en/ |title=Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre Abu Dhabi |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104182015/http://www.szgmc.ae/en/ |archive-date=4 January 2017}}</ref>

In 2009, the government diversified its economic plans. Served by high oil prices, the country's non-oil and gas GDP outstripped that attributable to the energy sector. Non-oil and gas GDP now constitutes 64% of the UAE's total GDP. This trend is reflected in Abu Dhabi with substantial new investment in industry, [[real estate]], tourism and retail. As Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer of the UAE, it has reaped the most benefits from this trend. It has taken on an active diversification and liberalization program to reduce the UAE's reliance on the hydrocarbon sector. This is evident in the emphasis on industrial diversification with the completion of free zones, Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, [[Two Four 54|twofour54]] Abu Dhabi media free zone and the construction of another, ICAD II, in the pipeline. There has also been a drive to promote tourism and real estate with the [[Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority]] and the Tourism and Development Investment Company undertaking several large-scale development projects. These will be served by improved transport infrastructure, with a new port, an expanded airport and a proposed rail link between Abu Dhabi and Dubai all in the development stages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/191913051.html |title=Abu Dhabi – Economic Base Diversifying |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=5 January 2009 |access-date=7 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref>

Abu Dhabi in the 1960s and 70s was planned for a predicted topmost population of 600,000. Following the urban planning ideals of the time period, the city has high-density tower blocks and wide grid-pattern roads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officeplusuae.com/company/contactus.php |title=www.OfficePlusUAE.com – Contact Us |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106055701/http://www.officeplusuae.com/company/contactus.php |archive-date=6 January 2013}}</ref> The population density is at its apex on the most northerly part of the island. At this point, the main streets have a large amount of 20- to 30-story towers. These towers are in a rectangular pattern, and inside is an ordinary grid pattern of roads with low rise buildings such as 2-story villas or 6-story low-rise buildings.

Due to this planning, a modern city with tall offices, apartment buildings, broad boulevards, and busy shops is present. Principal thoroughfares are the Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street, and Khalifa Street. Abu Dhabi is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. The design of the inner city roads and main roads are quite organised. Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal streets are oddly numbered, while all vertical streets are evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche is Street No. 1, Khalifa Street is Street No. 3, Hamdan Street is Street No. 5, Electra Street is Street No. 7 and so on. Conversely, [[Salam Street]] is St No. 8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Google Map of Abu Dhabi |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&time=&date=&ttype=&q=abu+dhabi&ll=24.48543,54.374685&spn=0.022264,0.047035&z=14&iwloc=addr&om=1&output=embed&s=AARTsJrE00-YUggvMJHd59dndcY7Dx3zCA |publisher=Google Maps |access-date=11 December 2018 |archive-date=18 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230418144143/https://www.google.com/maps/embed?origin=mfe&pb=!1m12!1m8!1m3!1d29048.005347115024!2d54.374685!3d24.48543!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!2m1!1sabu+dhabi!6i14 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mail is generally delivered to post-office boxes only; however, there is door-to-door delivery for commercial organisations. There are many parks throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however, there is often an entrance fee for adults. The Corniche, the city's seaside promenade, is about {{convert|10|km|mi}} in length, with gardens, playgrounds, and a BMX/skateboard ring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/what.to.see/attractions/abu.dhabi.corniche.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222330/http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/what.to.see/attractions/abu.dhabi.corniche.aspx|url-status=dead|title=The Corniche|archivedate=2 December 2013}}</ref>

In 2007 the [[Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council]] (UPC) was established, which is the agency responsible for the future of Abu Dhabi's urban environments and the expert authority behind the visionary Plan Abu Dhabi 2030 Urban Structure Framework Plan that was published in September 2007.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The UPC is also working on similar plans for the regions of Al-Ain and Al-Gharbia.

Because of the rapid development of Abu Dhabi, a number of challenges to the city's urban organisation have developed, among them:
* Today, the city's population far surpasses the original estimated maximum population when it was designed. This causes [[traffic congestion]], a shortage of car parking spaces, and overcrowding.
* Although there is an addressing system for the city, it is not widely used, causing problems in describing building locations. Directions must often be given based on nearby landmarks.
* However, there is a new naming system under the name of Onwani which is overhauling the entire addressing system of the entire Abu Dhabi Emirate. Its phases have already been implemented and are a success. The addressing system is up to international standards.

Poetry in Abu Dhabi and the UAE is highly regarded and often centric around satire, religion, family, chivalry, and love. According to an article from an Abu Dhabi tourism page, sheikhs, teachers, sailors, and princes make up a large bulk of the poets within the UAE. Al Khalil bin Ahmed formed a unique form of poetry to the UAE in the 8th century and was written in {{convert|16|m|abbr=off}}. Another Emirati poet, Ibn Daher, is from the 17th century. Daher is important because he used [[Nabati|Nabati poetry]] (AKA Bedouin poetry), poetry written in the vernacular instead of classical/religious Arabic. Other important poets from the UAE are Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880–1954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887–1959) and Abdulla bin Sulayem (1905–1976). These poets made headway in Classical Arabic poetry as opposed to the Nabati poetry of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Literature and poetry |url=http://www.visitabudhabi.ae/ |work=Welcome to Abu Dhabi |access-date=28 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918233244/http://www.visitabudhabi.ae/ |archive-date=18 September 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>
