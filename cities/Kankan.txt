'''Kankan''' ([[Mandingo language|Mandingo]]:&nbsp;Kánkàn; [[N'Ko script|N’ko]]: ߞߊ߲ߞߊ߲߫) is the largest city in [[Guinea]] in [[land area]], and the third largest in population, with a population of 198,013 people as of 2020.<ref name =recensement2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.stat-guinee.org/images/Publications/INS/RGPH3/RGPH3_etat_structure.pdf|title=Etat et Structure de la Population Recensement General de la Population et de l’habitation 2014
 |access-date=27 March 2020 |language=fr|website=Direction Nationale de la Statistique de Guinée| df=dmy }}</ref> The city is located in eastern [[Guinea]] about {{convert|345|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} east of the national capital [[Conakry]].

The city is the capital and largest town of the [[Kankan Prefecture]] and of the [[Kankan Region]] with its population being largely from the Mandinka ethnic group.

== Etymology ==
Kankan had different names before being dubbed '''Kankan''' during Arafan Kabine's rule as patriarch, which means 'the defenses' (or 'God protect our city from all the attacks'), due to successives attacks by the unfaithful people.

But there are other terms which says that during the Kaba's negotiation of the place from Conde's, they were informed to install where the people made the ''Kankan'' (A fixed wood that Mandes often used as a door), and there were no other human settlement between Makonon and Diankana (30&nbsp;km) during this moment.

The other terms are used by the griots, that there were too much of the ''Kankan-Kissè'' (an arborescent name) in to the area that Kankan settled in, so the Conde's told the Kaba to install this place, which made the Kaba to rename it as Kankan. Those terms have no sources and the speakers didn't know anything about Kankan's history.

== Geography ==
The city is located on the [[Milo River]], a tributary of the [[Niger River]].

==History==
===Early history===
According to oral histories, Kankan was founded in 1690 by Daouda Kaba, whose ancestors had come from Diafounou, in what is now Mali, a few decades earlier. His uncle Fodemoudou Conde, chief of the nearby village Makonon, gave Kaba the land on the banks of the Milo river near where the bridge is today, which was open bush. The hamlet was originally called '''Fadou''' (place of plenty), then '''Kaourou''' (prosperous place), then '''Nabaya''' (place of welcome).<ref name = KabaBachir>{{cite web |title=Bref rappel historique de la fondation de la ville de Kankan par Daouda Kaba en 1690 |url=http://www.kababachir.com/bref-rappel-historique-de-fondation-de-ville-de-kankan-daouda-kaba-1690/ |website=KabaBachir.com |access-date=21 July 2023 |date=20 Jan 2017}}</ref>

Another tradition holds that Kankan was founded in the mid 17th century by [[Dyula people|Dyula]] traders of the Sarif and Sanyo families. By the 18th century it was an important religious center under the great marabout and Islamic scholar Alfa Kaabinè Kaba as well as a center of trade linking the coast, the [[kola nut]] growing regions, and the [[Niger river]] valley to the north.<ref name=Massing>{{cite journal |last1=Massing |first1=Andrew |title=The Mane, the Decline of Mali, and Mandinka Expansion towards the South Windward Coast |journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines |date=1985 |volume=25 |issue=97 |pages=21–55 |url=https://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/cea_0008-0055_1985_num_25_97_2184.pdf |access-date=16 July 2023}}</ref>{{rp|41}} During this period Kankan was the capital of the [[Bate Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Camara |first1=Mohamed Saliou |title=The History of Guinea |url=https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-626 |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.626 |website=Oxford Research Encyclopedias |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=21 July 2023 |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |date=29 May 2020 |isbn=978-0-19-027773-4 }}</ref>

In 1763 the warlord Bourama Diakite from [[Wassoulou]] drove the inhabitants of the Bate region, including Kankan, intto [[Fouta Djallon|Fouta Jalon]], where they took refuge in Timbo and Fougoumba due to their shared [[Islam]]ic background. Their exile lasted seven years. Upon their return in 1770 they rebuilt and fortified the town and renamed it '''Kankan''', meaning 'protected city'.<ref name = KabaBachir/> The new town was built in six districts, two of which were named after the towns that had sheltered their inhabitants during exile. Timbo neighborhood still exists today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}.

Another later invasion from Wassoulou, led by the kings ''Diédi'' and ''Djiba'' (or ''DJI''), attempted to conquer Kankan but it was defeated by Alpha-Mamoudou Kaba.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}.

The French explorer [[René Caillié]] spent a month in Kankan in 1827 during his journey from [[Boké]], in present-day Guinea, to [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]] in Mali. He arrived with a [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] transporting [[kola nut]]s. He described the visit in his book ''Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo''. The town had a population of 6,000 inhabitants and was an important commercial centre with a market held three times a week. Instead of having a surrounding mud wall, the town was defended by [[Hedge#Quickset hedge|quickset hedges]]. The chief of the town refused Caillié permission to travel along the river to the north as the town of Kankan was fighting for control of the Bouré gold producing area around [[Siguiri]] and the [[Tinkisso River]]. Instead Caillié left the town heading east in the direction of [[Minignan]] in the Ivory Coast.<ref>{{cite book | last=Caillié | first=René | title=Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo; and across the Great Desert, to Morocco, performed in the years 1824-1828 (Volume 1) | publisher=Colburn & Bentley |location=London | year=1830 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/travelsthroughc00cailgoog/page/n294 254]–286 | url= https://archive.org/details/travelsthroughc00cailgoog }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Quella-Villéger | first=Alain | year=2012 | title=René Caillié, l'Africain : une vie d'explorateur, 1799-1838 | publisher=Aubéron | place=Anglet, France | isbn=978-2-84498-137-0 | language=fr | pages=71–75}}</ref>

=== Alliance with Samori and conflict ===
After defeating Jamoro Aji and Ouorokodo Famoudou in the Battle of Saman-Saman, Kankan sent emissaries to join the theocratic alliance led by [[Samori Ture]] and signed the peace treaty with him.

While Samori was trying to conquering the Cissé kingdom, he called on Bate (Kankan) to help him, but Kankan categorically refused because one of the Séré-Bréma's wives, Mali Kaba, was from Kankan. Samori saw this as a betrayal, and in 1879 sent troops to besiege the town within three months. Mamadi Kaba (commonly known as ''Dayi Kaba'') escaped the besieged city. During this siege, [[Kanfamoriyah|Karifamoudouya]] sent troops to break the siege over Kankan, but they were repelled and massacred until they crossed the River Gbourouroun, the border between two cities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}. After having driven out the Kaba, Samori installed a puppet ruler. Kaba, meanwhile, joined the French colonial forces in [[Ségou]], fighting with them until they captured Kankan in 1891, at which point the dynasty was restored.<ref name = EAHC>{{cite book |last1=Page |first1=Willie F. |editor1-last=Davis |editor1-first=R. Hunt |title=Encyclopedia of African History and Culture |date=2005 |publisher=Facts On File |volume=IV|page=201 |edition=Illustrated, revised}}</ref>

===Colonial Era===
In 1904, the city was chosen as the final destination for the railroad originating in [[Conakry]]. This was eventually completed in 1914, enhancing Kankan's longstanding position as a crossroads of trade. By 1922 it was widely seen as the second city of Guinea, after the capital Conkary.<ref name = EAHC/>

==Climate==
Kankan has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'').
