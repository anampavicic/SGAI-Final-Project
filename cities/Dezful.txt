==History==
Dezful is one of the oldest cities in the Khuzestan province. According to Walther Hinz excavations, Awan (capital of the first [[Elam]] empire) was located in Dezful.

The name Dezfūl is believed to be associated with a Sasanian bridge constructed over the Āb-e Dez by Šāpūr II. The Sasanians also built a fortress in close proximity to protect the bridge. This area, encompassing the bridge and the fortress, eventually evolved into the city of Dež-Pol or Dezfūl, although this name was not commonly used until the '''12th''' century.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dezful | title=Welcome to Encyclopaedia Iranica }}</ref>
In the '''10th''' century, the writer Eṣṭaḵrī referred to it as Qanṭarat-al-Andāmeš. It was also known as Qaṣr al-Rūnāš. The stone foundation of the bridge is still visible, while the upper part underwent several brick reconstructions during the early Islamic, Saljuq, and Qajar periods. In the 14th century, Ḥamd-Allāh Mostāwfī described it as 520 paces long and 15 paces wide, with forty-two arches. Šaraf-al-Dīn Yazdī, who visited the area in 795/1393, also provided a detailed description.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dezful | title=Welcome to Encyclopaedia Iranica }}</ref>

According to George Curzon, who visited the area in the late 19th century, the principal local industry in Dezfūl was indigo, with 120 factories in the town. The cultivation of indigo was introduced in the early 19th century. Dezfūl was also renowned for its fine reed pens.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dezful | title=Welcome to Encyclopaedia Iranica }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Dezful has been derived from the two words ''dej'' (fortress) + ''pul'' (bridge), which in combination could stand for 'the bridge to the fortress' or 'fortified bridge' in Persian language.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.dezfulshenasi.mihanblog.com/|title=اخبار استان های ایران|website=www.dezfulshenasi.mihanblog.com|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-date=21 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421094214/http://dezfulshenasi.mihanblog.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Everett-Heath |first=John |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191882913.001.0001/acref-9780191882913;jsessionid=5D174633F536B6D0B00C1BE5CF7B1F6E |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names |date=2019-10-24 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-188291-3 |language=en-US |doi=10.1093/acref/9780191882913.001.0001}}</ref> The original name of the city was Dezhpul, but after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the city was renamed Dezful,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> since the Arabic language does not have 'p' and 'zh' sounds.The city is also known as Dizful and Desful.<ref> The Columbia Encyclopedia {{cite book |last1=Columbia Press |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |isbn=9781786848468}}</ref>

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
The people of Dezful, known as Dezfuli, Dezfoolian or Dezfulian, speak Persian dialects of [[Dezfuli]] – a dialect distinct to Dezful – and [[Shushtari dialect|Shushtari]], a dialect of [[Shushtar]] that is sometimes considered to be one of the most archaic Persian dialects. These dialects belong to the Southwest Iranian language group. However, they differ significantly from standard Persian in terms of pronunciation, word formation, and vocabulary. The most notable distinctions are found in the structure of verbs. Although they share some similarities with nearby Lor dialects, they are still distinct. The differences between Dezfuli and Shushtari are mainly a result of variations in the detailed sound patterns of the language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dezful-03-dialect|title = DEZFŪLĪ AND ŠŪŠTARĪ DIALECTS Welcome to Encyclopaedia Iranica}}</ref>

Historically, Dezful was home to a [[Mandaeans|Mandaean]] community for many centuries.<ref name="Buckley 2002">{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The Mandaeans: ancient texts and modern people|publisher=Oxford University Press|publication-place=New York|year=2002|isbn=0-19-515385-5|oclc=65198443}}</ref> One of Dezful's best-known residents was the [[Mandaean priest]] [[Ram Zihrun]].<ref name="Buckley2010">{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The great stem of souls: reconstructing Mandaean history|publisher=Gorgias Press|publication-place=Piscataway, N.J|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59333-621-9}}</ref>{{rp|140}}

==Economy==
Sugarcane, which has been cultivated in the Dezfūl region for more than a thousand years, is still an important economic factor; a modern sugar refinery with a capacity of more than 300 tons has been built in Haft Tappa near the town of Dezfūl. Other major agricultural products of the šahrestān include wheat, barley, clover, alfalfa, sesame, maize, and grass peas; sheep are the most important livestock<ref>MASSOUD KHEIRABADI, "DEZFŪL i.

===Artisan work===
The Dezful reed pen is one of the important commercial products that has been cultivated in Dezful for the past three hundred years and is recognized as the finest reed pen at the national and global levels {{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}. In the past, the Dezful reed pen was exported to countries like Turkey and China, and it is still exported to most cities in Iran.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sina Goudarzi and Bahram Grami |title=QALAM |url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/qalam-pen}}</ref>

Dezful is also known for its handmade wooden tools, including hookah bases, hookahs, candlesticks, coat hangers, and salt shakers. Additionally, the city's handicraft traditions encompass metalwork, such as varshoosazi(crafting items from a [[Nickel silver|Nickle Silver]]), engraving on gold and silver, and goldsmithing. 

In the varshoosazi workshops of Dezful's old bazaar, artisans craft tools for tea drinking and other purposes.The craft of varshoosazi (the making of varsho items) in Iran dates back to the Safavid era, but its peak occurred during the Qajar period and continued into the Pahlavi dynasty. Varsho metal sheets, also known as German silver or [[Nickel silver|Nickle Silver]], were imported from Germany, particularly from Poland. This is why Iranian artisans named the metal varsho(Warsaw), after the city of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and the craft became known as varshoosazi.Artisans from Isfahan, Borujerd, and Dezful were the first to learn how to produce varsho crafts by observing Russian samovars and other products. The varshoosazi industry reached its height in Iran, particularly in the cities of Dezful and Borujerd, during the late Qajar and early Pahlavi periods. Many individuals adopted the surname Varshoochi or Varshabi in Dezful because it was closely associated with their profession as varsho craftsmen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nickel Silver Crafts; Traditional Art in Western Iran |date=31 March 2018 |url=https://ifpnews.com/nickel-silver-crafts-traditional-art-in-western-iran/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=KARAMIAN |first1=Gholamreza |title=Historical Metal works named Warsaw in Iran |journal=Historia i Świat |date=2020 |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=205–218 |doi=10.34739/his.2020.09.15 |url=https://czasopisma.uph.edu.pl/historiaswiat/article/view/1795/3126|hdl=11331/3066 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>
