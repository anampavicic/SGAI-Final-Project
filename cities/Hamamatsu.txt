Hamamatsu consists of a flat plain and the Mikatahara Plateau in the south, and a mountainous area in the north. It is roughly bordered by [[Lake Hamana]] to the west, the [[Tenryū River]] to the east, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south.

=== Climate ===
The climate in southern Hamamatsu has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with cool to mild winters with little snowfall; however, it is windy in winter because of the dry monsoon called ''Enshū no Karakaze'', which is unique to the region. The climate in northern Hamamatsu is much harsher because of [[foehn wind]]s. Summer is hot with the highest temperature often exceeds 35 degrees in the Tenryu-ku area, while it snows in winter.

As of 2008, many Brazilian parents have difficulty in deciding whether to send their children to Japanese schools or Brazilian schools, and it is common for Brazilian children attending Japanese schools to switch to a Brazilian school and vice versa.<ref name=Aparecidap218/> By 2010, many Brazilian parents had lost their jobs due to an economic decline, and many were unable to afford the Brazilian school monthly tuitions of ¥30,000 to ¥40,000.<ref name=FukueForeigners/>

As of 2010, about 50% of Brazilians of high school age in Hamamatsu [[Fushūgaku|do not attend high school]]. The inability to afford high school and difficulty with Japanese resulted in lower high school attendance rates. Hamamatsu NPO Network Center has made efforts to increase school attendance.<ref name=FukueForeigners/>

In Hamamatsu volunteers and a non-profit organization have established Japanese-language classes and native language classes for foreign children.<ref name=Kitawakip8/>

=== Festivals ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Nakatajima Sand Dunes]] -->

====Akiha Fire Festival====
: Haruno, Tenryu-ku<nowiki>:</nowiki> December
Long ago, Mount Akiha was believed to have supernatural powers to prevent fires. Bow and arrow, sword, and fire dances are performed at the Akiha Shrine. At the Akiha Temple, a [[firewalking]] ceremony is performed where both believers and spectators celebrate the festival.

====Enshū Dainenbutsu====
: Saigagake Museum, Hamamatsu City<nowiki>:</nowiki> July 15
When a family commemorates the first ''Obon'' holidays after the death of a loved one, they may request that a ''[[dainenbutsu]]'' (Buddhist chanting ritual) be performed outside their house. This is one of the local performing arts of the region. The group always forms a procession in front of the house led by a person carrying a lantern and marches to the sound of [[flute]]s, Japanese [[drum]]s and [[cymbal]]s.

====Hamamatsu Kite Festival====
: Naka-ku, Minami-ku, others<nowiki>:</nowiki> May
[[Hamamatsu Kite Festival]] is also called Hamamatsu Festival. Hamamatsu Kite Festival held from May 3 to May 5 each year, includes a ''Tako Gassen'', or kite fight, and luxuriously decorated palace-like floats. The festival originated about 430 years ago, when the lord of Hamamatsu Castle celebrated the birth of his first son by flying kites. In the Meiji Era, the celebration of the birth of a first son by flying ''Hatsu Dako'', or the first kite, became popular, and this tradition has survived in the form of Hamamatsu Kite Festival. During the nights of Hamamatsu Kite Festival, people parade downtown carrying over 70 ''yatai'', or palace-lake floats, that are beautifully decorated while playing Japanese traditional festival music. The festival reaches its peak when groups representing the city's various districts compete by energetically marching through the downtown streets.

: Hamakita-ku<nowiki>:</nowiki> June
This festival is held in honor of Ryujin, the god believed to be associated with the [[Tenryū River]], and features a wide variety of events such as the Hamakita takoage (kite flying) event and the ''Hiryu himatsuri'' (flying dragon fire festival) which celebrates water, sound, and flame.

====Football====
* [[Honda FC]] which plays [[Japan Football League]] (third division) games at their own [[Miyakoda Soccer Stadium]]. Honda competed in the [[Japan Soccer League]]'s First Division from 1981 to 1991, but chose to relegate itself and not compete in the professional divisions due to parent company [[Honda]]'s choice to retain team ownership. Many Hamamatsu football fans prefer to follow [[Júbilo Iwata]], across the [[Tenryū River]] in [[Iwata, Shizuoka|Iwata]]. Júbilo maintains a club shop within Hamamatsu.
* [[Volare FC Hamamatsu]], an autonomous club who competed in the Tokai Regional Football League Division 2 in 2011, flouted plans to either overtake Honda FC or merge with it, but it finished last in the Tokai League and was relegated. [[Hamamatsu University]] also keeps a team in the said division, but college teams cannot be promoted to the top three tiers.

====Basketball====
* [[SAN-EN NeoPhoenix]] plays in the [[B.League]], Japan's first division of professional basketball. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyohashi City General Gymnasium]].

The [[Hamamatsu Arena]] was one of the host arenas of the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]].
