'''Reims''' ({{IPAc-en|r|iː|m|z}} {{respell|REEMZ}};<ref>{{dict.com|Reims}}</ref> {{IPA|fr|ʁɛ̃s|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-Jules78120-Reims.wav}}; also spelled '''Rheims''' in English) is the most populous city in the French [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Marne (department)|Marne]], and the [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants|12th most populous city in France]]. The city lies {{convert|129|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Paris on the [[Vesle]] river, a tributary of the [[Aisne (river)|Aisne]].

Founded by the [[Gauls]], Reims became a major city in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|article=Reims|title=[[Petit Larousse|Nouveau petit Larousse]]|year=1971|page=1638}}</ref> Reims later played a prominent ceremonial role in [[history of France|French monarchical history]] as the traditional site of the coronation of the [[kings of France]]. The royal [[anointing]] was performed at the [[Cathedral of Reims]], which housed the [[Holy Ampulla]] of [[chrism]] allegedly brought by a white dove at the baptism of Frankish king [[Clovis I]] in 496. For this reason, Reims is often referred to in French as {{lang|fr|la cité des sacres}} ("the Coronation City").

Reims is recognized for the diversity of its heritage, ranging from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to [[Art Deco|Art-déco]]. [[Reims Cathedral]], the adjacent [[Palace of Tau]], and the [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]] were listed together as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1991 because of their outstanding Romanesque and Gothic architecture and their historical importance to the French monarchy.<ref name = "unesco">{{cite web |url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/601 |title = Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Former Abbey of Saint-Rémi and Palace of Tau, Reims |website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization |access-date = 17 October 2021}}</ref> Reims also lies on the northern edge of the [[Champagne wine region]] and is linked to its production and export.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Reims}}

[[File:Porte de Mars.jpg|thumb|left|[[Porte de Mars]], from the 3rd or 4th century<ref name=EB1911/>]]
Before the Roman conquest of northern [[Gaul]], Reims had served as the [[Remi]] tribe's capital, founded {{Circa|80&nbsp;BC}}. In the course of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[conquest of Gaul]] (58–51&nbsp;BC), the Remi allied themselves with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], and by their fidelity throughout the various [[Gauls|Gallic]] insurrections secured the special favour of the imperial power.<ref name=EB1911/> At its height in Roman times the city had a population in the range of 30,000–50,000 or perhaps up to 100,000.<ref name="google">

Christianity had become established in the city by 260, at which period Saint [[Sixtus of Reims]] founded the [[Diocese of Reims]] (which would be elevated to an [[archdiocese]] around 750). The consul [[Jovinus (consul)|Jovinus]], an influential supporter of the new faith, repelled the [[Alamanni]] who invaded [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] in 336, but the [[Vandals]] captured the city in 406 and slew [[Nicasius of Rheims|Bishop Nicasius]];<ref name=EB1911/> in 451 [[Attila the Hun]] put Reims to fire and sword.

From the manuscript of the ''History of the Emperors'' ([[Library of the Arsenal]]).]]
In 496—ten years after [[Clovis I|Clovis]], King of the Salian Franks, won his victory at [[Soissons]] (486)—[[Saint Remigius|Remigius]], the bishop of Reims, baptized him using the oil of the sacred phial–purportedly brought from heaven by a dove for the baptism of Clovis and subsequently preserved in the [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]].<ref name=EB1911/> For centuries the events at the crowning of Clovis I became a symbol used by the monarchy to claim the [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] to rule.

Meetings of [[Pope Stephen II]] (752–757) with [[Pepin the Short]], and of [[Pope Leo III]] (795–816) with [[Charlemagne]] (died 814), took place at Reims; here [[Pope Stephen IV]] crowned [[Louis the Debonnaire]] in 816. King [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]] gave the city and countship of Reims to the archbishop [[Artaldus]] in 940. King [[Louis VII]] (reigned 1137–1180) gave the title of duke and peer to [[William of Champagne]], archbishop from 1176 to 1202, and the archbishops of Reims took precedence over the other ecclesiastical [[peers of the realm]].<ref name=EB1911/>

By the 10th century, Reims had become a centre of intellectual culture. Archbishop [[Adalberon, archbishop of Rheims|Adalberon]] (in office 969 to 988), seconded by the monk Gerbert (afterwards (from 999 to 1003) [[Pope Silvester II]]), founded schools which taught the classical "[[liberal arts]]". (Adalberon also played a leading role in the dynastic revolution which elevated the [[Capetian dynasty]] in the place of the [[Carolingian]]s.)<ref name=EB1911/>

[[File:Calice du sacre Tau.jpg|thumb|The Coronation Chalice, also known as the Chalice of Saint Remigius ([[Palace of Tau]])]]
The archbishops held the important prerogative of the consecration of the kings of France – a privilege which they exercised (except in a few cases) from the time of [[Philip II of France|Philippe II Augustus]] (anointed 1179, reigned 1180–1223) to that of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (anointed 1825). The [[Palace of Tau]], built between 1498 and 1509 and partly rebuilt in 1675, would later serve as the Archbishop's palace and as the residence of the kings of France on the occasion of their coronations, with royal banquets taking place in the ''Salle du Tau''.<ref name=EB1911/>

[[File:Ingres coronation charles vii.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''[[Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII]]'', 1854 ([[Louvre]])]]
[[Louis VII]] granted the city a communal charter in 1139. The [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) ceded it to the English, who had made a futile attempt to take it by siege in 1360; French patriots expelled them on the approach of [[Joan of Arc]], who in 1429 had [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] consecrated in the cathedral. [[Louis XI]] cruelly suppressed a revolt at Reims, caused in 1461 by the [[Gabelle|salt tax]].{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

During the [[French Wars of Religion]] the city sided with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] (1585), but submitted to King [[Henri IV]] after the [[battle of Ivry]] (1590).<ref name=EB1911/> At about the same time, the [[English College, Douai|English College]] had been "at Reims for some years."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Seventeenth-Century Tradition: A Study in Recusant Thought|author=George Henry Tavard|year=1978|isbn=9004054561|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tr8eAAAAIAAJ}}</ref>

The [[Place Royale, Reims|Place Royale]] was built in the 18th century. Some of the 1792 [[September Massacres]] took place in Reims.

In the invasions of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] in 1814, anti-Napoleonic allied armies captured and re-captured Reims.

==Climate==
Reims has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''), influenced by its inland position. This renders that although the maritime influence moderates averages, it nevertheless is prone to hot and cold extremes in certain instances. Reims has a relatively gloomy climate due to the said maritime influence and the dominance of low-pressure systems for much of the year. In spite of this, the amount of precipitation is fairly limited.
