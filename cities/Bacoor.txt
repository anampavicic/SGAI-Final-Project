'''Bacoor''' ({{IPA|tl|bakoʔˈoɾ|IPA}}), officially the '''City of Bacoor''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Bacoor}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 664,625 people, making it the 15th most populous city in the Philippines{{PH census|current}} and the second largest city in the province of Cavite after [[Dasmariñas]].

==Etymology==
The name of Bacoor is transcribed in old sources variously as "Bacoor", "Bacor", "Bakur", etc. It was originally the name of the [[Bacoor Bay]] which separates the [[Cavite peninsula]] from the mainland. The name is believed to be originally from the [[Philippine Negrito languages]], meaning "circle", referring to the shape of the bay.<ref name="Chamberlain">{{cite journal |last1=Chamberlain |first1=Alexander F. |title=Philippine Studies. 1. Place-Names |journal=The American Antiquarian and Oriental Journal |date=January–November 1900 |volume=22 |pages=394–399}}</ref>

Another possible origin of the name of Bacoor is from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "highlands" or "plateau" (cf. [[Bacolor]] and [[Bacolod]]).<ref name="Lesho">{{cite book |last1=Lesho |first1=Marivic |last2=Sippola |first2=Eeva |title=Vergleichende Kolonialtoponomastik Strukturen und Funktionen kolonialer Ortsbenennung |date=2018 |publisher=De Gruyter |chapter=Toponyms in Manila and Cavite, Philippines |isbn=9783110608618 |pages=317–332}}</ref>

==History==
===Spanish colonization era===
{{see also|Battle of Zapote Bridge (1897)}}
Bacoor was one of the flashpoints of the [[Cavite Mutiny]] of 1872. Bacoor's parish priest at that time, [[Mariano Gomez (priest)|Fr. Mariano Gómez]], was one of the [[GOMBURZA]] trio implicated in the mutiny for advocating the [[secularization]] of [[priesthood]] in the Philippines. He and the rest of GOMBURZA were executed at [[Rizal Park|Bagumbayan]] in 1872.<ref name=Gomez>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilacathedral.org/history/7th-cath.htm |title=The Secularization Issue and the Execution of Gomburza |work=The Seventh Cathedral: 1879-1945 |publisher=The Manila Cathedral |access-date=August 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000521/http://www.manilacathedral.org/history/7th-cath.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=Gomez2>{{cite web |url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/gomburza.html |title=GOMBURZA: Reluctant martyrs started it all |publisher=Filipino.biz.ph - Philippine Culture |access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> The death of the [[GOMBURZA]] served as the inspiration for [[Jose Rizal]]'s ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', which in turn influenced the ignition of the [[Philippine Revolution]].

[[File:Bacoor revo govt HQ.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bahay na bato]] (Cuenca Ancestral House) served as the headquarters of the Philippine revolutionary government in 1898.]]
During the [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain in 1896, Bacoor was one of the first towns in Cavite to rise up. A [[Katipunan]] chapter, codenamed ''Gargano'', led by Gil Ignacio from barrio Banalo, started the hostilities in Bacoor on September 2, 1896, three days after the revolution began.<ref name=Aguinaldo>{{cite book |title=Mga Gunita ng Himagsikan |first=Emilio |last=Aguinaldo |place=Manila |year=1964}}</ref>

On February 17, 1897, General [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Emilio Aguinaldo's]] 40,000-strong force confronted a 20,000-strong Spanish reinforcement at the Zapote River. The Katipuneros reinforced the southern bank of the river with trenches designed by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[engineer]] [[Edilberto Evangelista]]. 

Edilberto Evangelista was known as the "Engineer of the revolution" and the "Hero of the revolution". They also blew up the Zapote Bridge with explosives which killed several Spaniards crossing it and thereby preventing them from reaching Cavite and forcing them to retreat to [[Muntinlupa]]. Despite the Filipino victory, they lost the brilliant Evangelista who was killed in action.<ref name="Aguinaldo" /><ref name="Zapote">{{cite book|author=Crisanto, Joyce M.|author2=Chit dela Torre|name-list-style=amp |title=The Battle of Zapote Bridge |work=Las Piñas: A City with Heritage |publisher=Villar Foundation |year=2006 |location=Las Piñas, Philippines }}</ref>

However, after the Spanish counteroffensive in May 1897, Bacoor and the rest of Cavite finally fell to the Spaniards, forcing Aguinaldo and his men to retreat to [[Republic of Biak-na-Bato|Biak-na-Bato]].<ref name=Aguinaldo/>

===American invasion era===

[[File:Zapote River Bridge in 1899.jpg|thumb|left|Zapote Bridge in 1899, site of the historic battle in 1897 which killed Gen. [[Edilberto Evangelista]]]]
With the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|Philippine declaration of independence]] from Spain on June 12, 1898, hostilities reignited in Cavite and Bacoor was designated as the first capital of [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Emilio Aguinaldo's]] revolutionary government until it was transferred to [[Malolos, Bulacan]] in August 1898, a month before the convening of the [[Malolos Congress]].<ref name=Aguinaldo/> 

The Zapote Bridge became the site once again of another battle on June 13, 1899, this time between Philippine and [[United States|American]] troops. An American force of 1,200 men supported by naval gunfire from the American squadron in [[Manila Bay]] crushed a 5,000-strong Filipino force led by General [[Pío del Pilar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nhcp.gov.ph/the-other-battle-of-zapote-the-filipinos-bloody-defense-of-the-motherland/ |title=The Other Battle of Zapote: The Filipinos' Bloody Defense of the Motherland |first=Cielo |last=Reyno |publisher=National Historical Commission of the Philippines |date=April 3, 2013 |access-date=August 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Philippine Insurrection Against the United States |first=John R.

On October 15, 1903, the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] enacted Act No. 947, merging Bacoor and [[Dasmariñas|Perez-Dasmariñas]] with [[Imus]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=947|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-Three Municipalities of the Province of Cavite to Eleven|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20947|date=October 15, 1903|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref> Bacoor was reconstituted as an independent municipality on October 24, 1906 by virtue of Act No. 1551, thus separating it from Imus.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1551|title=An act increasing the number of municipalities in the province of Cavite from eleven to twelve, by separating from Imus the former municipality of Bacoor and giving the latter the territory which it comprised prior to the passage of act numbered 947|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201551|date=October 24, 1906|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref>

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, in 1942, Japanese occupation forces entered Bacoor and other towns of Cavite province. From May 7, 1942, to August 15, 1945, many Caviteños joined the Cavite Guerrilla Unit (CGU), a recognized guerrilla group headed by Colonel Mariano Castañeda. 

This group would eventually become the Filipino-American Cavite Guerrilla Forces (FACGF). Colonel Francisco Guerrero and the FACGF's 2nd Infantry Regiment was put in charge of Japanese resistance in Bacoor. 

The FAGCF, together with Filipino soldiers under the 4th, and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army liberated and recaptured Bacoor and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was defeated the Japanese Imperial Army forces from January 1, to August 15, 1945, during the [[Philippines Campaign (1944-45)|Allied liberation of the Philippines]].<ref name="Japanese">{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/kabitenyo1/kabite3m.htm|title=Cavite during the Japanese Occupation|work=Cavite Historical and Cultural Page|publisher=Cavite State University-College of Arts and Sciences|date=April 10, 2012 |access-date=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503132751/http://www.reocities.com/kabitenyo1/kabite3m.htm|archive-date=May 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Philippine independence===
In 1972, Bacoor became a center of commemoration for the centennial of the martyrdom of the [[Gomburza]] and its beloved parish priest Padre [[Mariano Gomez (priest)|Mariano Gomes]]. The celebrations were headed by Mayor [[Pablo Gomez Sarino]], a relative of Fr. Gomes, which included the turnover of a historical marker to the town of Bacoor. 

On June 21, 1988, Mayor Angelito Miranda was assassinated in front of a hospital in [[Las Piñas]] by two gunmen, which the police claimed to be from a notorious drug syndicate.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Naval|first1=Toting G.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
During the 1990s and 2000s, Bacoor attempted to achieve cityhood status due to its growing population and tax income, with several cityhood bills filed in Congress in 1997, 2000 and 2007. On July 25, 2011, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] signed into law Republic Act No. 10160 creating the City of Bacoor.<ref name="ra10160" /> It was ratified through a plebiscite on June 23, 2012,<ref name=Cityhood>{{cite news|url=http://96.31.84.32/articles/363121/bacoor-votes-on-cityhood-today#.UVmi3RxmiSo |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130410010806/http://96.31.84.32/articles/363121/bacoor-votes-on-cityhood-today%23.UVmi3RxmiSo |archive-date=April 10, 2013 |url-status=dead|title=Bacoor Votes on Cityhood Today |work=Manila Bulletin|date=June 22, 2012 |access-date=April 1, 2013 }}</ref> wherein majority of the town's participated registered voters favored the cityhood.<ref name=Yes>{{cite news |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/262995/news/regions/bacoor-now-a-city-in-cavite-after-plebiscite-imus-town-next |title=Bacoor, Now a City after Plebiscite |work=GMA News|date=June 24, 2012 |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> 

With the incorporation of Bacoor as a city, it was divided into two legislative districts, Bacoor West and Bacoor East. During the 2013 mid-term elections, the citizens of Bacoor voted for six councilors for each of the two districts.

==Geography==
[[File:Molino Dam.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Molino Dam]] was built during the Spanish period to divert water for farm irrigation.]]

===Physical===
Bacoor is strategically located at the gateway to [[Metro Manila]]. A sub-urban area, the city is located {{convert|5|km}} from [[Imus]] and {{convert|15|km}} southwest of Manila, on the southeastern shore of [[Manila Bay]], at the northwest portion of the province with an area of 52.4 square kilometers. 

It is bordered to the east by [[Las Piñas]] and [[Muntinlupa]], to the south by [[Dasmariñas]], to the west by [[Kawit]] and [[Imus]], and to the north by [[Bacoor Bay]], an inlet of Manila Bay. Bacoor is separated from Las Piñas by the Zapote River and Imus and Kawit by the Bacoor River.

Most of the city comprises flat, formerly agricultural lands, while some areas, such as the coastal barangays of Zapote, Talaba, Niog, and Panapaan, are below sea level. Some barangays, such as Molino and Queens Row, are situated on the hills that form valleys along the upstream portion of the Zapote River.

===Barangays===
Bacoor is politically subdivided into 73 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

These barangays are grouped into two local electoral districts, officially called Bacoor West and Bacoor East, represented in the [[Sangguniang Panglungsod|city council]] by their respective councilors. However, the city government has officially abandoned such name designation for the electoral districts and has released edicts officially calling them District 1 and District 2, respectively.<ref name="ra10160">{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=10160|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2012/04/10/republic-act-no-10160/|title=Charter of the City of Bacoor|year=April 10, 2012|access-date=June 17, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber-RA|number=11274|title=An Act Amending Section 10(b) of Republic Act No. 10160, Otherwise Known as the "Charter of the City of Bacoor"| url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2019/04/12/republic-act-no-11274/ |date=April 12, 2019|access-date=June 17, 2023}}</ref>

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Bacoor features a [[tropical savanna climate]] that borders on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Aw/Am). Together with the rest of the Philippines, Bacoor lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the [[equator]] means that the temperature range is small, rarely going lower than {{convert|20|C|F}} and going higher than {{convert|38|C|F}}. However, humidity levels are usually very high, which makes it feel much warmer. It has a distinct [[dry season]] from late December through April and a relatively lengthy [[wet season]] that covers the remaining period. The southwest monsoon, or ''Habagat'', occurs from June to September and can cause flooding in parts of the city.

In the 2020 census, the population of Bacoor, was 664,625 people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|664,625/46.17|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}. It is the second most populous city in the province after [[Dasmariñas]].

The city is a [[commuter town|bedroom community]] of Metro Manila which owes its large population to the influx of low and middle-income settlers who availed of the various housing projects and subdivisions in it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/11515/bacoor-and-korea |title=Bacoor and Korea |first=Rina |last=Jimenez-David |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=September 8, 2011 |access-date=August 12, 2014}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File: St._Michael_the_Archangel_of_Bacoor.jpg|thumb|left|The original centuries-old image of [[Saint Michael the Archangel]], Patron saint of Bacoor, Cavite.]]

[[Roman Catholicism]] is the dominant religion in Bacoor. It is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Imus|Diocese of Imus]] and is the seat of the Vicariate of St. Michael the Archangel and the Vicariate of Santo Niño de Molino. One of Bacoor's notable parish priests was [[Mariano Gomez (priest)|Fr. Mariano Gómez]], one of the [[GOMBURZA]] trio implicated in the [[Cavite Mutiny]] who served as parish priest at the Bacoor parish church from 1824 to his death in 1872.<ref name=Gomez/><ref name=Gomez2/> Another notable priest who served the parish of Bacoor was [[Ezequiél Moreno y Díaz|St. Ezekiel Moreno]] at the time when it was still part of the vast hacienda of the Recollects. He tirelessly provided the Last Rites to the victims of a cholera plague which affected the towns of Bacoor and Imus and was responsible for the rehabilitation of the [[Molino Dam]] to irrigate the rice fields of Bacoor and Las Piñas. 

[[File:Saint Michael the Archangel Parish Church (Evangelista, Bacoor, Cavite; 09-19-2021).jpg| thumb|right| The Roman Catholic Parish of St. Michael the Archangel, founded in 1752]]

Due to the [[Philippine Revolution]], Bacoor was once again ministered to by secular Filipino priests under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila]]. However, during the [[American occupation of the Philippines| American occupation]] in 1902, the Catholic parish priest at that time, Fr. Fortunato Clemeña, became the first [[Philippine Independent Church|Aglipayan]] priest of Bacoor, as well as the first Aglipayan Bishop of Cavite, during the Aglipayan Schism. Most of the first members of the church in Bacoor were [[Katipuneros]] headed by [[Mariano Noriel|General Mariano Noriel]], who is also the first president of the laymen organization. The conversion of Father Clemeña eventually led to the occupation of the old parish church of Bacoor by the Philippine Independent Church, whose occupation ended in 1907 by order of the Philippine Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Catholic Church for illegally-occupied church property.<ref>{{cite document| publisher = Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands| title = Rev. Jorge Barlin v. P. Vicente Ramirez|date = November 24, 1906}}</ref> After this recovery, the Roman Catholics exerted efforts in the early 20th century to revive its numbers in the town through the revitalization of its  fiesta and the establishment of new traditions. Despite this, and the influx of largely non-Aglipayan migrants from Manila and from other provinces, the presence of the Aglipayan church is still evident in the city. The Aglipayan Diocese of Cavite's Cathedral in Barangay Digman, which is also dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, is situated a few blocks away from the town's Catholic church. It is the second dominant religion in Bacoor.

Bacoor also has a significant population of [[Muslim Filipino|Muslims]], mostly middle-class [[Maranao]] traders and merchants, with a minority of [[Badjao]] fishing communities. Several mosques cater to the local Muslim community of Bacoor, the largest being Masjid As-Salaamah, opposite Zapote market. A number of [[Protestant]] and other [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations also have a presence in the city.

==Economy==
{{stack|float=left|{{PH poverty incidence}}}}
[[File:Bacoorjf0252 14.JPG|thumb|right|Mussels and oysters are two of Bacoor's main products.]]
[[File:Bacoorjf0115 07.JPG|thumb|right|Bamboo is another common product in Bacoor.]]

===Commerce===
Bacoor is currently experiencing a rapid shift from an agriculture-based economy to a residential/commercial urban center. Nowadays, retail, manufacturing, banking and service sectors are Bacoor's primary income earners. Commercial activities are sporadic throughout the city ranging from wholesale to retail establishments, restaurants and eateries, hardware and construction supplies and other service-related industries, especially those located in SM City Bacoor where it serves as the city's main income earner. The mostly residential area of Molino is also home to SM Center Molino at the corner of Molino Road and Daang Hari. The entrance area from the [[Manila–Cavite Expressway|Coastal Road]] to Aguinaldo Highway in Talaba and the area surrounding the Zapote Public Market (now the Bacoor Public Market) are other commercial centers. Bacoor has branches of 11 different commercial banks all over the city.

Meanwhile, agricultural area has lessened to only 100 hectares while fishponds which likewise decreased to almost half of the original 760 hectares. Salt production, fishing, oyster and mussel culture, which are now being threatened to near extinction because of pollution and overpopulation, are the other sources of income of the residents. These industries are also threatened by the construction of the [[Manila–Cavite Expressway|Cavite Coastal Road Extension]] which directly affected the Bacoor shoreline.<ref name="Econ">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhphilippines.org/work_bacoor.html |title=Community Profile: Bacoor, Cavite |publisher=[[Food for the Hungry|Food for the Hungry Philippines]] |year=2004 |access-date=April 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426201758/http://www.fhphilippines.org/work_bacoor.html |archive-date=April 26, 2014 }}</ref>

===Land use===
Land use developments in Bacoor include a proposed industrial village in Barangay Niog which will include light cottage industries with supporting residential and commercial facilities. A vast tract of land in Molino area, on the other hand, is envisioned to host residential, institutional and commercial facilities. Dubbed as the ''New Bacoor'', the land use plan in Molino seeks to utilize the area not only as a dormitory for individuals who work in Metro Manila but also for people who have migrated to Bacoor in search of economic advancement. {{clear-left}}

===City seal===
[[File:Bacoor-official logo.png|170px|right]]
The current seal of the City of Bacoor was adopted in 2012 after its conversion to city. It bears resemblance to the previous seal when Bacoor was still a municipality, but with additional symbols that reflect the city's character and recent developments. It is composed of a circular ribbon with the phrases ''Lungsod ng Bacoor'' (City of Bacoor) and ''Lalawigan ng Cavite'' (Province of Cavite) on the top and bottom portion of the ribbon. The ribbon symbolizes the continuity of Bacoor's time-honored traditions despite its conversion to a city. On the foreground is the Zapote Bridge, which was the site of two major battles during the Philippine Revolution against Spain and the Filipino-American War. The bridge features 73 bricks symbolizing the 73 barangays that make up to city. Written on the bridge is 1671, the year the city was founded.<ref name=Seal>{{cite web |url=http://philgovseals.nhcp.gov.ph/bacoor-city/ |title=Bacoor (City) |work=Interactive Registry of Government Seals |publisher=National Historical Commission of the Philippines |access-date=August 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821030112/http://philgovseals.nhcp.gov.ph/bacoor-city/ |archive-date=August 21, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Underneath the bridge is a body of water symbolizing Zapote River, which passes through the city. Floating over it is a mussel shell, a seafood cultivated in the city and symbolizes its two new districts, Bacoor West and Bacoor East. On top of the bridge is an 11-member marching band, symbolizing the 11 marching bands that are found in the city and a callback to its nickname as the country's marching band capital. Serving as background to the bridge are (on the left) a bamboo tree, from which the city's name was taken and describes the resilient nature of its people; and (on the right) buildings, which symbolizes the city's progress. Between these two symbols is the Philippine sun with its eight rays, signifying the city's role in the province during the revolution against Spain. Above the sun is 2012, the year Bacoor was converted into a city of Cavite. Behind these symbols are the colors of the Philippine flag: red, which symbolizes courage; white, symbolizing peace; and blue, which symbolizes the people of Bacoor's calmness, serenity and commitment to protecting the environment, as well as of the waters of its rivers and Manila Bay.<ref name=Seal/>

As with every [[Philippine city]], Bacoor's chief executive is the city mayor. Elected to a term of three years and limited to three consecutive terms, the chief executive appoints the directors of each city department, which include the office of administration, engineering office, information office, legal office, and treasury office. The incumbent [[mayor of Bacoor]] is [[Lani Mercado|Lani Mercado-Revilla]], from the [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas]] Party, who first served as the city's lone representative in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine House of Representatives]] from 2010 to 2016.

The city's vice mayor performs duties as acting governor in the absence of the mayor. The vice mayor also automatically succeeds as mayor upon the death of the incumbent. The vice mayor also convenes the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]], the city's legislative body. The incumbent vice mayor of Bacoor is Catherine Sarino-Evaristo from the [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas]] Party. She first assumed office on June 30, 2013, after defeating former vice mayor Rosette Miranda-Fernando.<ref name=Bacoor2016/> She ran and was elected for a second term in 2016.

===Legislative===
The city, which is a lone congressional district, is represented in the Philippine House of Representatives by congressman Strike Revilla from the [[Lakas–CMD (2009)|Lakas]] Party, brother-in-law of Mayor Lani Mercado-Revilla. He first assumed office as city mayor from 2007 to 2016.<ref name=Bacoor2016/> Within the city, the City Board or [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] crafts all city ordinances, performs appropriation of city funds, issues franchises and permits, impose fees on city services, and exercise other duties and powers as stipulated by the Local Government Code of 1991. Being a first-class city in terms of income, Bacoor is entitled to a City Board composed of 12 members, six each from the city's two board districts.

Common forms of transportation are buses, mini-buses, public utility vans, jeepneys.<ref name="Getting there"/>

Due to the congestion of Bacoor's major thoroughfares and overpopulation, the city suffers from daily heavy traffic.

The groundbreaking for the LRT Line 1 South Extension Project was held on Thursday, May 4, 2017, with the actual construction officially commencing on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, after the [[Right-of-way (property access)|right-of-way]] became "free and clear" from obstructions.

{{as of|2024|04|30|df=US}}, phase 1 is 98.2% complete. [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] Executive Assistant Jonathan Gesmundo announced the construction of 8 additional stations to the current 20 LRT-1 stations with operations of LRT-1 Cavite Extension Phase 1 are expected by mid-November 2024. Meanwhile, phases 2 and 3 will begin operations by 2031. Once fully operational, Bacoor will be served by the LRT-1 via the future [[Niog station]].

Bacoor is also part of the proposed [[Cavite–Laguna Expressway]] (CALAX) which will be funded through debt financing.  Metro Pacific Tollways Corp. (MPTC), which will undertake the construction of CALAX, has announced it will borrow P30 billion for the project. MPTC president Rodrigo Franco "said the firm will partner with local banks for debt financing by earlier next year."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://interaksyon.com/business/132238/metro-pacific-tollways-to-borrow-p30b-for-calax-cebu-cordova-bridge-projects|title=Metro Pacific Tollways to borrow P30B for CALAX, Cebu-Cordova Bridge projects|language=en-US|access-date=September 10, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909145154/http://www.interaksyon.com/business/132238/metro-pacific-tollways-to-borrow-p30b-for-calax-cebu-cordova-bridge-projects|archive-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>

===Health===

===Public safety===
The Bacoor Traffic Management Department (BTMD) and the Bacoor Public Safety Unit are the main agencies tasked for maintaining peace and order in the city. The Bacoor Police Station, a component of the Cavite Police Provincial Office under the [[Philippine National Police]], assists them in this regard. Given the status of the BTMD as the highest office in the local bureaucracy (with the status of a department), it has been entrusted by the city government to oversee ordinance implementation city-wide with the PNP playing second fiddle.
