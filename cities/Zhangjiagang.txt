== Etymology ==
Zhangjiagang is derived from a port in the city, while the port is named after a tributary, Zhangjia. All of them are written as "{{lang|zh-hans|张家港}}" in Chinese.

==History==
{{expand section|date=March 2024}}
The area of the city was under jurisdiction of Jiyang township, Piling county during the Han dynasty. It was transferred to Jiyang (then Liangfeng) county which established in 281, while the eastern part of Jiyang was separated as Nansha county in 335. Nansha was merged into Changshu and likewise Liangfeng was merged into Jiangyin. The two counties were demarcated formally by three rivers whose names were Chuan Gang, Jiejing He and South Gudu Gang since 1667. In 1874, a canal called Chang-Tong gang demarcating then Changshu and Nantong was built.

The shoals formed by alluvial deposits in varying of shape and size border&nbsp;the Yangtze River were called shazhou in Chinese. Thus, when the CPC established a new county which located in then Northern Changshu, it was designated as Shazhou. The county was disestablished after the [[Double Tenth Agreement]] was signed. In 1962, Changshu and Jiangyin separated their owned parts to establish a county bearing Shazhou.  When the county was turn into a county-level city in 1986, it was renamed Zhangjiagang.

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Located 140 kilometers from [[Shanghai]], Zhangjiagang is located along the southern banks of the Yangtze River. The land surrounding Zhangjiagang is extremely fertile, with large spans of rice paddies. In addition, many fish farms are located around the city. Many tributaries of the Yangtze have been contaminated from the construction and operation of chemical factories in the suburb areas.

Zhangjiagang is a special industrial zone.

==Language==

Zhangjiagang, like many regions in [[China]], has its own unique dialect that differs from the standard [[Mandarin Chinese]] spoken throughout the country. The local dialect is often referred to as Zhangjiagang dialect or [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]]. The vast majority of the residents of Zhangjiagang belong to [[Han Chinese]], and Zhangjiagang dialect is derived from [[Wu Chinese]]. It originated from [[Suzhou]] in the 5th century BC and is spoken by more than 8% of the population in [[China]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wu-language | title=Wu language &#124; Britannica }}</ref> It is the main local language of East [[China]], and major cities include [[Shanghai]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], and [[Wuxi]]. People can basically communicate with other dialects of Northern [[Jiangsu]]. through [[Wu Chinese]].{{cn|date=July 2023}}

In Zhangjiagang, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is the official language. Zhangjiagang dialect is a sub-dialect of the broader Jianghuai Mandarin ([[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]]), which is spoken in the surrounding region.<ref>{{Cite magazine |archive-date=Feb 27, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230227213032/https://www.pressreader.com/australia/asian-geographic/20160501/282772060936403 |url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/asian-geographic/20160501/282772060936403 |title=Jianghuai Mandarin |date=1 May 2016 |magazine=[[Asian Geographic]] |language=en |access-date=9 August 2023 |via=[[PressReader]] |url-status=live}}</ref> This dialect is characterized by its distinctive pronunciation and vocabulary, which differ from the standard [[Mandarin Chinese]]. It contains a total of five different dialects, including Yuxi dialect, Chengdong dialect, Chengyao dialect (subdivided from Jiangyin dialect), Laosha dialect, Xinsha dialect (also known as Chongming dialect), and a small amount of Northern Jiangsu dialect. Among them, Yuxi dialect, Chengdong dialect, Laosha dialect, and Xinsha dialect are the most widely distributed and have the most populations. They have become the representative dialects of the city.<ref name="360doc.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.360doc.com/content/11/1113/11/6859663_164138818.shtml | title=张家港的方言 }}</ref>

Yuxi dialect is spoken by the southeastern town of Tangqiao, which is basically the same as the [[Changshu]] urban area, commonly known as the "Changshu dialect", distributed in the southeast near [[Changshu]], Tangqiao, and other towns and the east of Yangshe. Yuxi dialect accounts for 25.53% of the registered population.<ref name="wenku.baidu.com">{{Cite web|url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/ecd590bc6b0203d8ce2f0066f5335a8102d26636.html?_wkts_=1677534758043&bdQuery=%E5%BC%A0%E5%AE%B6%E6%B8%AF%E6%96%B9%E8%A8%80|title=张家港的方言 - 百度文库|website=wenku.baidu.com}}</ref>

Chengdong dialect is represented by Yangshe dialect in the urban area, it is actually the transition zone between the [[Wu Chinese|Wu language]] around [[Lake Tai]] and the surrounding districts of Suzhou. Chengdong dialect accounts for 26.4% of the registered population.<ref name="wenku.baidu.com"/>

Represented by Deji, Laosha dialect is distributed in Chenyang, Daxin, and other towns in the northwest, with the using population taking up about 20.76%.<ref name="360doc.com"/>  Laosha dialect contains a characteristic of Jianghuai official dialect, for example, "nothing" is said to be "nope".{{cn|date=July 2023}}

Xinsha dialect is also known as "Shashang dialect" and "Chongming dialect", spoken by people in Jinfeng, Sanxing, Nanfeng and other towns along the river in the northeast and Changyinsha Farm, the population who speak Xinsha dialect accounts for about 23.13%.<ref name="360doc.com"/>

Northern Jiangsu dialect includes Nanhua dialect, [[Rugao]] dialect, and [[Taixing]] dialect. People in the southern part of Zhangjiagang are original residents, and the northern part is where immigrants live. Therefore, the residents in the south part are called [[Jiangnan]] (south part of Yangtze River) people in tradition, which accounts for 51.93% of the population. The rest of the residents in the north are called Shashang people and account for 48.07% of the population.<ref name="wenku.baidu.com"/> These vernaculars share some basic properties like voice [[Sonorant]]. It’s a complete voice produced by the vibration of the vocal tract, and it’s always voiced. For example, the sound "sh" is often pronounced as "s" in Zhangjiagang dialect, and some words may be pronounced differently or have different meanings.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang Songlin |title=I. A. Richards and Wu Mi: Basic English, Vernacular Chinese, and Chung Yung |journal=The Cambridge Quarterly |date=March 2012 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=66–81 |doi=10.1093/camqtly/bfr044|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Despite the prevalence of [[Mandarin Chinese]] in [[China]], regional dialects like Zhangjiagang dialect remain an essential part of local culture and identity. Many locals continue to speak the dialect daily and use it to communicate with family and friends. However, with the increasing homogenization of language and culture throughout [[China]], the use of regional dialects like Zhangjiagang dialect is slowly declining.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bild-lida.ca/educationalsociolinguistics/uncategorized/language-as-a-tool-for-cultural-homogenization/ | title=Language as a tool for cultural homogenization | date=8 October 2020 }}</ref>

In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in preserving and promoting local dialects in [[China]], including Zhangjiagang dialect. Efforts to document and study these dialects are underway, and some schools and community organizations are offering classes in local dialects to help preserve them for future generations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/202010/20/content_WS5f8e468ac6d0f7257693e1d4.html | title=Largest project for preserving language built }}</ref>

Overall, while [[Mandarin Chinese]] remains the dominant language in [[China]], regional dialects like Zhangjiagang dialect continue to play an important role in local culture and identity. As [[China]] continues to modernize and globalize, it will be interesting to see how these dialects evolve and adapt to changing circumstances.

==Population==


Zhangjiagang has experienced population growth over the years, with a noticeable spike between 2018 and 2019. In contrast, the household population has seen a slight decline during the same period. This could be attributed to various factors, such as migration or changes in household sizes.
