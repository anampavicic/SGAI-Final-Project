==History==
Before the [[Meiji period]], the area which is now Nasushiobara was mostly uninhabited wasteland, due to lack of suitable water for agriculture. [[Ōtawara Domain]] built a number of [[irrigation canal]]s during the [[Edo Period]], but the scale was small. However, in the Meiji period, the Nasu Canal and other agricultural development projects aimed at opening the region to farming led to rapid development, and many local place names still bear the names of various government officials of the Meiji period.  With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the villages of Karino, Takabayashi, Nabekake, Nishi-Nasuno, Higashi-Nasuno in Nasu District, and Shiobara in Shioya District were formed. A portion of Higashi-Nasuno became the town of Kuroiso in 1912. Shiobara became a town in 1919, and Nishi-Nasuno in 1932. In 1955, Kuroiso annexed Takabayashi, Nabekake and the remainder of Higashi-Nasuno, and Nishi-Nasuno annexed Kariya. Kuroiso became a city in 1970, and Shiobara was transferred to Nasu District in 1982. The modern city of Nasushiobara was established on January 1, 2005, from the merger of the former city of [[Kuroiso, Tochigi|Kuroiso]], and the towns of [[Nishinasuno, Tochigi|Nishinasuno]] and [[Shiobara, Tochigi|Shiobara]] (both previously constituent towns of [[Nasu District, Tochigi|Nasu District]]).

==Government==
Nasushiobara has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city assembly of 26 members. Nasushiobara, together with the town of Nasu collectively contributes four members to the Tochigi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Tochigi 3rd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Nasushiobara relies heavily on seasonal tourism to its [[onsen|hot spring]] and ski resorts. Agriculture is centered on dairy production. The city mascot, Miruhi, was created to represent the city's dairy production. The city also has several [[industrial park]]s.

==Education==
*[[Utsunomiya Kyowa University]]
*Nasushiobara has 20 public [[primary school]]s, ten public [[middle school]]s and one combined primary/middle school operated by the city government. The city has four public [[high school]]s operated by the Tochigi Prefectural Board of Education. The prefectural also operates one special education school for the handicapped.
