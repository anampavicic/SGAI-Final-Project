'''Anantnag''' ({{IPA|ks|/ə'nʌntna:g/ or /-nɑːg/}} {{audio|Anantnag IPA.ogg|listen}}), also called '''Islamabad''',<ref name="Bhat2017"/> is the administrative headquarters of [[Anantnag district]] of Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the disputed [[Kashmir]] region.<ref name=tertiary-kashmir> The application of the term "administered" to the various regions of [[Kashmir]] and a mention of the Kashmir dispute is supported by the [[WP:TERTIARY|tertiary sources]] (a) through (d), reflecting [[WP:DUE|due weight]] in the coverage. Although "controlled" and "held" are also applied neutrally to the names of the disputants or to the regions administered by them, as evidenced in sources (f) through (h) below, "held" is also considered politicized usage, as is the term "occupied," (see (i) below). <br/>

== Name ==
The town has been called by both the names Islamabad and Anantnag. The latter is characterised by [[Marc Aurel Stein]] as its "Hindu name".<ref name=Stein>{{citation |first=M.

"Anantnag" derives from the name of the spring at the southern end of the town, whose Sanskrit name {{transl|sa|Anantanāga}} was mentioned in the ''[[Nilamata Purana]]'' and other texts.<ref name=Stein/> According to the ''Gazetteer of Kashmir and Ladak'', it is named after [[Ananta Shesha|Ananta]], the great serpent of Vishnu and the emblem of eternity.<ref>{{citation |title=Gazetteer of Kashmir and Ladak |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.43256 |via=archive.org |publisher=Superintendent of Government Printing |location=Calcutta |year=1890  |page=170}}</ref>

The name ''Islamabad'' is believed to have derived from the name of a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor Islam Khan who built a garden in the area.<ref name=kashmirwatch>{{Cite news |title=Anantnag or Islamabad?

Both names are used for the town, ''Anantnag'' being preferred by the Hindus and Sikhs while ''Islamabad'' is preferred by the Muslims.

[[Anantnag railway station|Anantnag]] (ANT) is a station on the 119&nbsp;km (74&nbsp;mi) long [[Jammu–Baramulla line|Banihal-Baramulla line]] that started in October 2009 and connects Baramulla (BRML) and Srinagar to Banihal (BAHL), Qazigund. The railway track also connects to [[Banihal]] across the [[Pir Panjal]] mountains through a newly constructed 11&nbsp;km long Banihal tunnel, and subsequently to the Indian railway network after a few years. It takes approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds for a train to cross the tunnel. It is the longest rail tunnel in India. This railway system, proposed in 2001, is not expected to connect the Indian railway network until 2017 at the earliest, with a cost overrun of 55 billion INR. The train also runs during heavy snow across the Kashmir Valley.
