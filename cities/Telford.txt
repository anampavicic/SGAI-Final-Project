'''Telford''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Telford-rev-2.ogg|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|f|ər|d}}) is a town in [[Shropshire]], England. It is the administrative centre of [[Telford and Wrekin]] [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]], a [[Unitary authorities in England|unitary authority]] which covers the town, its suburbs and surrounding settlements. The town is close to the county's eastern boundary, and near the [[River Severn]].

The notable hill near the town called [[The Wrekin]] is part of the [[Shropshire Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. To the south of the town is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Places around the Ironbridge Gorge area, which were developed into the town itself, are internationally recognised as being "The Birthplace of Industry" being to a large extent constructed during the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Shropshire Coalfield.

The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]], [[Wolverhampton]] is {{convert|19|mi|km}} south east and [[Birmingham]] is {{convert|28|mi}} in the same direction. In the 2011 census, the town had a population of 142,723<ref>Telford and Wrekin population estimates, 2011 {{URL|https://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/3825/telford_and_wrekin_population_estimates_and_projections_2011}}</ref> while in 2017, the wider borough had an estimated population of 175,271.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/7198/telford_and_wrekin_key_facts_-_december_2016|title=Telford & Wrekin Council download - Key facts sheets About my council {{!}} Facts and figures|last=Council|first=Telford & Wrekin|website=www.telford.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> It is the most populous settlement in Shropshire, [[Shrewsbury]] is second and is {{convert|15|mi|km}} to the west of the town. It is near [[Staffordshire]]: [[Stafford]] is {{convert|21|mi|km}} to the east and [[Stoke-on-Trent]] is {{convert|25|mi|km}} north east from the town.

The town is polycentric, having been designated under the [[New Towns Acts]] in 1963 and 1968 and [[New towns in the United Kingdom#England|developed between the 1960s to the 1970s]]. Centred on [[Telford Shopping Centre|a shopping centre]] and [[Telford Town Park|a public park]], the new town is named after [[Thomas Telford]], a [[civil engineer]] on many road, canal and rail projects in the county.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Poulton-Smith|first1=Anthony|title=Shropshire Place Names|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-4889-3|page=137}}</ref> It was originally designated under the name '''Dawley New Town''', [[Dawley]] being to the south of new-town's centre. As well as multiple villages and Dawley, the other constituent towns are [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Oakengates]].

==History==

===Early history===
[[File: SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]
Early settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Wrockwardine]] and [[Lilleshall]].<ref name="hist" />

From the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], where [[Wenlock Priory]] founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area's economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.<ref name="hist">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18062|title=History of Telford|work=British History Online|access-date=21 March 2008}}</ref>

The area was the site of the 1821 [[Cinderloo Uprising]], which saw 3,000 people protest against the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disturbances near Wellington |work=Salopian Journal |date=7 February 1821}}</ref>

[[File: TelfordPlaza.JPG|thumb|right|Telford Plaza in Telford Town Centre.]]

The New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administration as '''Dawley New Town''', covering {{convert|9100|acre|km2}} of [[Dawley]], [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington Rural District (Shropshire)|Wellington Rural District]] and [[Shifnal Rural District]].<ref>'' London Gazette''. 18 January 1963.</ref> Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new Sutton Hill housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based [[John Madin Design Group]].

The Minister proposed an extension of {{convert|12000|acre|ha}} in 1968 (taking in the historic area of [[Ironbridge Gorge]]). The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|ha}} of "land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> The Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]], who in 1787 became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.

Most of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by the [[Commission for New Towns]], later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region. There is a Retail Park called [[Wrekin Retail Park]] in Wellington.

In 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries,<ref>{{cite news|title=30 years on - how opening of M54 brought new dawn for Shropshire|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/11/25/30-years-on/|access-date=29 April 2016|work=Shropshire Star|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> the [[M54 motorway]] was completed, connecting the town to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and thence the rest of the UK's motorway network. Other major roads are the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]], [[A518 road|A518]] and [[A442 road|A442]], which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or ''EP'', and is officially branded ''Queensway''.

Many of the new town's residents were originally from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[conurbation]], which includes [[Wolverhampton]], Birmingham, [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]]. A majority of the [[Council housing|council house]] tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner-city Birmingham. The rehousing affected existing communities, who were sometimes resentful of the changes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Archaeology, Community and Identity in an English New Town|journal=Historic Environment: Policy and Practice|year=2011|doi=10.1179/175675011X12943261434602|last1=Belford|first1=Paul|volume=2|pages=49–67}}</ref> As a result some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] or Dawley) and often citing the existence of town Councils as support for the argument "you can't live in a town in a town”, e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town's residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname 'overspill' from people living in the existing towns and villages.

In 2007 a £250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which includes the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre and the creation of new cafés, bars and shops which would lead to 1,750 new jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7053156.stm|title=BBC Shropshire – Redevelopment scheme unveiled|access-date=19 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The reason for the expansion is that the original 'centre' was only ever a shopping place with no real heart. As the 'centre' closed early in the evening there was no nightlife at all in the area, the only major local entertainment areas being in Oakengates and Wellington.

The first phase of the town-centre development, named Southwater, was completed in 2014.<ref name=shropshirestar-20140313>{{cite news |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2014/03/13/telfords-southwater-opening-schedule-is-unveiled/ |title=Telford's Southwater opening schedule is unveiled |newspaper=Shropshire Star |date=13 March 2014 |access-date=14 December 2015}}</ref> The official opening ceremony, on 18 October 2014, included live music and fireworks. The area includes a refurbished library, various chain restaurants, [[Cineworld]] IMAX Cinema, a bowling alley/arcade and a new multi-storey car park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telfordshopping.co.uk/events/southwater-grand-opening |title=Southwater Grand Opening |publisher=Telford Shopping Centre |year=2014 |access-date=14 December 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:TheWrekin.jpg|thumb|[[The Wrekin]] overlooks the town]]

Telford town centre lies about {{convert|16|mi|km}} [[Boxing the compass|east/south-east]] of [[Shrewsbury]] and {{convert|20|mi|km}} [[Boxing the compass|north-west]] of [[Wolverhampton]]. The town covers 7,803 hectares (30.13 square miles) and its southern and eastern parts, between the [[Severn Gorge]] and [[Donnington Wood]], include the East Shropshire coalfield. North and north-west Telford lie beyond the coalfield's boundary fault on [[Bunter (geology)|sandstone beds]] which, along with other [[Triassic]] formations, prevail over much of the [[North Shropshire]] plain. The town centre stands on a watershed, with land to the south draining towards the [[River Severn]] and to the north sloping gently down towards the Weald Moors. The town is dominated by the [[Wrekin]], a large hill of 407&nbsp;m (1335&nbsp;ft),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.d1210.org/wrekin.html |title=Rotary Club of The Wrekin |publisher=D1210.org |date=31 March 2008 |access-date=28 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106215654/http://www.d1210.org/wrekin.html |archive-date=6 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> south-west of Wellington, straddling the border with the unitary [[Shropshire Council]] (before the latter's creation in 2009 the borough of [[Shrewsbury and Atcham]]).<ref name="hist" />

==Governance==
[[File:TelfordParishes.png|thumb|Ward map; Telford urban area highlighted in orange, within the [[Telford and Wrekin]] borough.]]
{{further|List of civil parishes in Shropshire#Telford and Wrekin}}
Within the borough of [[Telford & Wrekin]], the town is entirely [[civil parish|parished]]. Telford has no single town council because of this. The town is also divided into Wards, within the [[Telford and Wrekin]] borough. These are used for electoral purposes and demographic surveys. Telford was created politically – but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent towns: [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]], [[Oakengates]], [[Dawley]], [[Ironbridge]] and [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of [[Ironbridge]] and [[Broseley]], while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by [[Shropshire Council]].

Telford is the only settlement within the [[Telford (UK Parliament constituency)|Telford parliamentary constituency]], which was held by [[Labour Party UK|Labour]] from its creation in 1997 until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]]. It was then held by [[Lucy Allan (politician)|Lucy Allen]] who stood down ahead of the [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024 general election]] after defecting to the [[Reform UK]] party. The current MP since the election is [[Shaun Davies (politician)|Shaun Davies]] (Labour). Some suburbs, such as Wellington, are located in [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], which also has varying support between the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservatives]] and Labour. Conservative [[Mark Pritchard (politician)|Mark Pritchard]] was reelected as the latter seat's MP in 2024, and has now held the seat continuously since 2005. Telford is administratively part of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]].

==Demography==
{{Telford area}}
In 1963 Dawley new town was intended to take 50,000 people from the [[West Midlands conurbation]]<ref>Dept. of Econ. Affairs, The W. Midlands: a regional study (1965), 3–4, 84.</ref> and so to grow to a town of 70,000 or more. By 1968 Telford was intended to take an additional 50,000 and grow to a town of 220,000 or more by 1991. By 1983, however, Telford's population was just under 108,000, and it was generally thought that it might not reach 120,000 by the late 1980s.<ref name="hist" />

The population of Telford's built-up area was 147,980 according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]].<ref name=BUA>{{NOMIS2011|id=E34004622|title=Telford BUA|accessdate=26 October 2020}} (includes map of the area concerned)</ref> At the 2001 census, the urban area had 138,241 people.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales-part-1.pdf | title = Key Statistics for urban areas in England and Wales: Table KS01 | publisher = [[Office for National Statistics]] | date = 2004 | accessdate = 26 October 2020 | archive-date = 15 January 2016 | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160115044330/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales-part-1.pdf | url-status =dead }}</ref> The built-up area includes [[Broseley]] which lies outside the Borough of [[Telford and Wrekin]] and also includes the towns of [[Dawley]], [[Oakengates]], [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] and [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]].<ref name=BUA/>

Telford has a younger than average population, and a higher rate of teenage pregnancy than the national average, as well as relatively high levels of income deprivation with 15% of residents living in low income households. In addition the level of statutorily homeless households in 2004/05 was above average for England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communityhealthprofiles.info/profiles/hp2007/lo_res/00GF-HP2007.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080609153757/http://www.communityhealthprofiles.info/profiles/hp2007/lo_res/00GF%2DHP2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2008 |title=Association of Public Health Observatories – Health Profiles |publisher=Communityhealthprofiles.info |date=11 June 2008 |access-date=28 June 2009 }}</ref> The [[Telford and Wrekin]] area is a popular commuter zone, containing some relatively rural areas in the North and West of the borough. These are popular with commuters to the [[West Midlands conurbation]], due to the good transport links provided by the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]/[[M54 motorway|M54]].

In 2011, the town was 91.9% white (88.5% White British), 4.7% Asian, 1.2% Black, 1.9% Mixed race and 0.2% other.<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-westmidlands.php?cityid=E35001307|title=Telford (Telford and Wrekin, West Midlands, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> At the same census the population of the town was 142,723 and had an area of 46.2 kilometers with the population estimated to be 147,105 in 2016.

During the economic crisis of the late 1960s (with unemployment doubling nationally during the second half of the decade), unemployment in the then-new town was initially high.

However, in 1967 '''Halesfield Industrial Estate''' was founded on the south-eastern edge of the town – the first real answer to Telford's unemployment problems. Other large estates followed, in 1973 with '''Stafford Park''' just east of the [[Telford Town Centre|town centre]] and in 1979 with '''Hortonwood''', to the north, helping ease the unemployment crisis in a decade which saw an almost unbroken rise in unemployment.

In total, half a million square metres of factory space were provided between 1968 and 1983, making Telford an attractive investment area.<ref>Private inf.; Thomas, 'Telford', 36-7; Fenter, 'Bldg. Development in Telford'; Reps. of Dev. Corporations 31 March 1969, H.C. 398, pp. 469–70 (1968–69), xliii; 31 March 1983, H.C. 81, p. 317 (1982–83); Town Planning Rev. xliii. 360 n. 52.</ref>

By 1976, Telford had begun to recruit industry from the US, Europe, and [[Japan]]. The foreign firms required larger factories, and they began to be built at Stafford Park. By 1983 over 2,000 jobs in Telford were provided by around 40 (mostly American) foreign companies.<ref>The Times, 24 November 1983 (p. 22).</ref> In contrast to industry in the [[Black Country]] at the time, these new companies focused on high-technology industries rather than the heavy and metal-finishing industries.<ref>Reps. of Dev. Corporations 31 March 1983, 309.</ref>

The new arrivals included the American company [[Unimation]] and three firms from Japan: [[Nikon]] UK Ltd., which opened a warehouse at Halesfield in 1983;<ref>T.D.C. Telford Ind. Dir. [c. 1979], 28.</ref> video-tape manufacturers [[Hitachi Maxell]] at Apley Castle in 1983;<ref>	 Shropshire Star, 12 November 1983 (p. 3).</ref> and office equipment manufacturers [[Ricoh]], who took a {{convert|22|acre|m2|adj=on}} site for a factory at [[Priorslee]] next to the [[M54 motorway|M54]], and formed the first in Telford's new enterprise zone.<ref>Shropshire Star, 24 October 1983 (pp. 1, 6)</ref><ref>Shropshire Star, 16 November 1982; 2 December 1983 (p. 16)</ref>

Consequently, from the later 1970s, Telford began to attract high-technology firms and to diversify its industry, and the promotion of the Service industry also began to prosper, in the [[Telford Town Centre]] area. However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate of increase in unemployment was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.<ref>N. Staffs. Jnl. Field Studies, xiii. 78; Telford Development Strategy: 6th Monitoring Rep. (T.D.C. 1983), 8–12, 22–8; B. Trinder, Hist. Salop. (1983), 121; Shropshire Star, 10 March 1982.</ref>

Unemployment in Telford was still around the 20% mark – nearly double the national average at the time – as late as 1986. The [[Lawson Boom]] of the next three years saw that figure fall dramatically by the end of the decade, only for it to rise to a similarly high figure again by 1992 as a result of the [[early 1990s recession]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk/infobyarea/region/area/areaassessment/pages/default.aspx?region=55&area=410 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217175014/http://oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk/infobyarea/region/area/areaassessment/pages/default.aspx?region=55&area=410 |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 December 2010 |title=Oneplace homepage |publisher=Oneplace.audit-commission.gov.uk |date=20 January 2013 |access-date=29 May 2013 }}</ref> In recent years the local economy has matured, the median gross weekly earnings for full-time workers who work in Telford and Wrekin was '''£563''' in 2019 (West Midlands '''£552.50''' and England '''£591.40''').

[[File:Southwater Phase 1 - new developments at Telford Town Centre (geograph 4236071).jpg|thumb|The 2014 Southwater development just south of the shopping centre]]
Telford has attracted several large IT services companies, including [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] who support the MOD contract from the Euston Park site, as well as a vast array of clients across the world from the Plaza building. Also [[Capgemini]] and [[Fujitsu]] employ a significant number of staff in the area, mainly supporting their [[British Government|governmental]] client, [[HM Revenue & Customs|HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)]]. The expansion in these job sectors provided a great asset to Telford's economic recovery after 1992. By August 2007, the success story of Telford's economy had seen unemployment shrink to 3.3% – a fraction of its peak 15 years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/roots/packages/tra/tra_y07.htm |title=Shropshire Routes to Roots &#124; Transport and communication &#124; From trackways to motorways |publisher=.shropshire-cc.gov.uk |date=1 August 2007 |access-date=29 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925200430/http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/roots/packages/tra/tra_y07.htm |archive-date=25 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
