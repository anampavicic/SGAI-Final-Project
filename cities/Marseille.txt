'''Marseille''' or '''Marseilles''' ({{langx|fr|Marseille}}; {{langx|oc|label=[[Provençal dialect|Provençal Occitan]]|Marselha}}; see [[#Name|below]]) is the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[France|French]] [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] and of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]]. Situated in the [[Provence]] region of [[southern France]], it is located on the coast of the [[Gulf of Lion]], part of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], near the mouth of the [[Rhône]] river. A resident of Marseille is a {{lang|fr|Marseillais}}.

Marseille is the third-largest city in France by [[Urban area (France)|urban area]] (when combined with [[Aix-en-Provence]]), and its [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants|second-most populous city]], with 873,076 inhabitants in 2021 (Jan. census)<ref name="population">{{cite web| url=https://statistiques-locales.insee.fr/#c=indicator&i=pop_depuis_1876.pop&s=2021&selcodgeo=13055&t=A01&view=map1 | title=Statistiques locales - Marseille : Commune - Population municipale (historique depuis 1876) | author=INSEE| access-date=12 July 2024|language=fr| author-link=Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques}}</ref> over a municipal territory of {{convert|241|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.

Founded {{circa|600 BC}} by Greek settlers from [[Phocaea]], Marseille is the oldest city in France, as well as one of Europe's oldest continuously inhabited settlements.{{sfn|Duchêne|Contrucci|1998|loc=page needed A}} It was known to the [[ancient Greeks]] as [[Massalia]] ({{Langx|grc|label=[[Ancient Greek|Greek]]|Μασσαλία|Massalía}}) and to [[ancient Romans|Romans]] as ''Massilia''.{{sfn|Duchêne|Contrucci|1998|loc=page needed A}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ebel |first=Charles |title=Transalpine Gaul: the emergence of a Roman province |publisher=Brill Archive |year=1976 |isbn=90-04-04384-5 |pages=5–16 }}, Chapter 2, ''Massilia and Rome before 390 B.C.''</ref> Marseille has been a trading port since ancient times. In particular, it experienced a considerable commercial boom during the colonial period and especially during the 19th century, becoming a prosperous industrial and trading city. Nowadays the [[Old Port of Marseille|Old Port]] still lies at the heart of the city, where the manufacture of [[Marseille soap]] began some six centuries ago. Overlooking the port is the [[Notre-Dame de la Garde|Basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde]] or "Bonne-mère" for the people of Marseille, a [[Byzantine architecture|Romano-Byzantine]] church and the symbol of the city. Inherited from this past, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille (GPMM) and the maritime economy are major poles of regional and national activity and Marseille remains the first French port, the second Mediterranean port and the fifth European port.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Notteboom |first=Theo |title=Concurrence entre les ports et les liaisons terrestres avec l'arrière-pays |date=11 March 2009 |isbn=9789282102268 |series=Tables rondes FIT |pages=27–81 |chapter=Les ports maritimes et leur arrière-pays intermodal |doi=10.1787/9789282102299-3-fr |access-date=30 October 2020 |chapter-url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789282102299-3-fr}}</ref> Since its origins, Marseille's openness to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city marked by cultural and economic exchanges with Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. In Europe, the city has the third largest Jewish community after [[London]] and [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mandel |first=Maud S. |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400848584 |title=Muslims and Jews in France |date=5 January 2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-4858-4 |doi=10.1515/9781400848584}}</ref>

In the 1990s, the [[Euroméditerranée]] project for economic development and urban renewal was launched. New infrastructure projects and renovations were carried out in the 2000s and 2010s: the [[Marseille tramway|tramway]], the renovation of the [[InterContinental Marseille Hotel Dieu|Hôtel-Dieu]] into a luxury hotel, the expansion of the [[Stade Vélodrome|Velodrome Stadium]], the [[CMA CGM Tower]], as well as other quayside museums such as the [[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations|Museum of Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean]] (MuCEM). As a result, Marseille now has the most museums in France after [[Paris]]. The city was named [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2013 and European Capital of Sport in 2017. Home of the [[association football]] club [[Olympique de Marseille]], one of the most successful and widely supported clubs in France, Marseille has also hosted matches at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]]. It is also home to several higher education institutions in the region, including the [[Aix-Marseille University|University of Aix-Marseille]].

==Name==
The name of Marseille is of unknown ultimate origin, but it is thought it may come from [[Ligurian (ancient language)|Ancient Ligurian]], which was the local language before the arrival of the Greeks. Forms of the name include:

* In English ''Marseille'' or ''Marseilles'', both pronounced {{IPAc-en|m|ɑːr|ˈ|s|eɪ}} {{respell|mar|SAY}};
* In French {{lang|fr|Marseille}}, which is pronounced {{IPA|fr|maʁsɛj||Fr-Normandie-Marseille.ogg}} in [[Standard French]] and {{IPA-frdia|maχˈsɛjə||Fr-Marseille.ogg}} in [[Meridional French|local French]];
* In [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ([[Provençal dialect|Provençal]]) {{lang|oc|Marselha}} ({{IPA|oc|maʁˈsejɔ, maʁˈsijɔ|pron}}) according to the Classical orthographic norm, which may be written {{lang|oc|Marsiho}} according to the [[Mistralian norm]], from the [[Old Occitan|Medieval Occitan]] {{lang|pro|Marselha}} or {{lang|pro|Masselha}};
* In [[Latin]] {{lang|la|Massilia}}, from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μασσαλία}} ({{transl|grc|Massalía}}), which is the oldest attestation of the name, since [[Massalia|the city was founded by Greek settlers]] around 600 BC, and remained for a long time a Greek-speaking place even after it fell under Roman rule.

==Geography==

[[File:MarseilleFrance.jpg|thumb|A [[Sentinel-2]] satellite view of Marseille]]
Marseille is the third-largest metropolitan area in France after Paris and Lyon. To the east, starting in the small fishing village of Callelongue on the outskirts of Marseille and stretching as far as [[Cassis]], are the [[Calanque]]s, a rugged coastal area interspersed with small [[fjord]]-like inlets. Farther east still are the [[Sainte-Baume]] (a {{convert|1147|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} mountain ridge rising from a forest of [[deciduous]] trees), the city of [[Toulon]] and the [[French Riviera]]. To the north of Marseille, beyond the low [[Garlaban]] and Etoile [[mountain range]]s, is the {{convert|1011|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire|Mont Sainte Victoire]]. To the west of Marseille is the former artists' colony of [[l'Estaque]]; farther west are the [[Côte Bleue]], the [[Gulf of Lion]] and the [[Camargue]] region in the [[Rhône]] [[river delta|delta]]. The [[Marseille Provence Airport|airport]] lies to the north west of the city at [[Marignane]] on the [[Étang de Berre]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Michelin Guide to Provence, {{ISBN|2-06-137503-0}}</ref>

The city's main thoroughfare (the wide boulevard called the [[Canebière]]) stretches eastward from the [[Old Port of Marseille|Old Port]] to the Réformés quarter. Two large forts flank the entrance to the Old Port—Fort Saint-Nicolas{{efn|Port Saint-Nicholas is a 17th-century fortress built around the small medieval chapel of Entrecasteaux near the [[Abbey of St Victor, Marseille]].}}<ref>{{harvnb|Duchêne| Contrucci|1998|page=384}}</ref> on the south side and [[Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]] on the north. Farther out in the Bay of Marseille is the [[Frioul archipelago]] which comprises four islands, one of which, If, is the location of [[Château d'If]], made famous by the [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]] novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. The main commercial centre of the city intersects with the Canebière at Rue St Ferréol and the Centre Bourse (one of the city's main shopping malls). The centre of Marseille has several pedestrianised zones, most notably Rue St Ferréol, Cours Julien near the Music Conservatory, the Cours Honoré-d'Estienne-d'Orves off the Old Port and the area around the Hôtel de Ville. To the south east of central Marseille in the [[6th arrondissement of Marseille|6th arrondissement]] are the Prefecture and the monumental fountain of Place Castellane, an important bus and metro interchange. To the south west are the hills of the [[7th arrondissement of Marseille|7th]] and [[8th arrondissement of Marseille|8th arrondissements]], dominated by the [[basilica]] of [[Notre-Dame de la Garde]]. Marseille's main railway station—[[Marseille-Saint-Charles Station|Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles]]—is north of the Centre Bourse in the 1st arrondissement; it is linked by the Boulevard d'Athènes to the Canebière.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

===Climate===
The city has a [[Mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') with cool-mild winters with moderate rainfall, because of the wet westerly winds, and hot, mostly dry summers.<ref name="Marseille, France">{{Cite web |title=Marseille, France Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase) |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=5670&cityname=Marseille,+France |access-date=8 February 2019 |website=Weatherbase}}</ref> December, January, and February are the coldest months, averaging temperatures of around {{convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|4|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. July and August are the hottest months, averaging temperatures of around {{convert|28-30|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|19|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night in the Marignane airport [{{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} from Marseille] but in the city near the sea the average high temperature is {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July.<ref>Météo France, 1981–2010 averages</ref>

Marseille receives the most sunlight of any French city, 2,897.6 hours per year on average,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deluzarche |first1=Céline |title=France : top 20 des villes les plus ensoleillées |url=https://www.futura-sciences.com/planete/questions-reponses/meteorologie-france-top-20-villes-plus-ensoleillees-11296/ |website=Futura Sciences |access-date=29 April 2023 |language=fr}}</ref> while the average sunshine in the country is around 1,950 hours.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} It is also the driest major city with only {{convert|532.3|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, mainly due to the [[Mistral (wind)|mistral]], a cold, dry wind originating in the [[Rhône]] Valley that occurs mostly in winter and spring and which generally brings clear skies and sunny weather to the region. Less frequent is the [[sirocco]], a hot, sand-bearing wind, coming from the Sahara. Snowfalls are infrequent; over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The hottest temperature was {{convert|40.6|°C|1}} on 26 July 1983 during a great heat wave, the lowest temperature was {{convert|-16.8|°C|1}} on 13 February 1929 during a strong cold wave.<ref name=marseilleobsnormals/>

==History==
{{main|History of Marseille}}
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Massalia large coin 5th 1st century BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A silver [[Ancient drachma|drachma]] inscribed with MASSA[LIA] ({{lang|grc|ΜΑΣΣΑ[ΛΙΑ]}}), dated 375–200 BC, during the [[Hellenistic period]] of Marseille, bearing the head of the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek goddess]] [[Artemis]] on the [[obverse]] and a lion on the reverse]]

Marseille was founded as the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] of [[Massalia]] {{circa|600 BC}}, and was populated by Greek settlers from [[Phocaea]] (modern [[Foça]], Turkey). It became the preeminent Greek ''[[polis]]'' in the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] region of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|southern Gaul]].<ref>Patrick Boucheron, et al., eds. ''France in the World: A New Global History'' (2019) pp 30-35.</ref> The city-state sided with the [[Roman Republic]] against [[Carthage]] during the [[Second Punic War]] (218–201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the [[western Mediterranean]] even as Rome expanded its empire into [[Western Europe]] and [[North Africa]]. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman [[Siege of Massilia]] in 49 BC, during [[Caesar's Civil War]], in which Massalia sided with the [[Optimates|exiled faction]] at war with [[Julius Caesar]]. Afterward, the [[Gallo-Roman culture]] was initiated.

The city maintained its position as a premier maritime trading hub even after its capture by the [[Visigoths]] in the fifth century AD, although the city went into decline following the sack of AD 739 by the forces of [[Charles Martel]] against the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Arabs]]. It became part of the [[County of Provence]] during the tenth century, although its renewed prosperity was curtailed by the Black Death of the 14th century and a sack of the city by the [[Crown of Aragon]] in 1423. The city's fortunes rebounded with the ambitious building projects of [[René of Anjou]], Count of Provence, who strengthened the city's fortifications during the mid-15th century. During the 16th century, the city hosted a naval fleet with the combined forces of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], which threatened the ports and navies of the [[Genoese Republic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=France-Ottoman {{!}} Ottoman History|url=https://ottoman.ahya.net/node/76|access-date=24 April 2021|website=ottoman.ahya.net}}</ref>

Marseille lost a significant portion of its population during the [[Great Plague of Marseille]] in 1720, but the population had recovered by mid-century. In 1792, the city became a focal point of the [[French Revolution]], and though France's [[national anthem]] was born in [[Strasbourg]], it was first sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille, hence the name the crowd gave it: ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and establishment of the [[Second French colonial empire]] during the 19th century allowed for the further expansion of the city, although it was occupied by the German [[Wehrmacht]] in November 1942 and subsequently heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. The city has since become a major center for immigrant communities from former French colonies in Africa, such as [[French Algeria]].

==Economy==
{{POV section|date=September 2023}}

Marseille is a major French centre for trade and industry, with excellent transportation infrastructure (roads, sea port and airport). Marseille Provence Airport is the fourth largest in France. In May 2005, the French financial magazine ''L'Expansion'' named Marseille the most dynamic of France's large cities, citing figures showing that 7,200 companies had been created in the city since 2000.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Neumann |first=Benjamin |date=1 May 2005 |title=Les villes qui font bouger la France |trans-title=Cities That Are Moving France |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/economie/les-villes-qui-font-bouger-la-france_23845.html |magazine=L'Express |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Roularta Media Group |access-date=28 January 2008 |archive-date=1 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101122131/http://www.lexpansion.com/economie/les-villes-qui-font-bouger-la-france_23845.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> {{As of|2019}}, the Marseille metropolitan area had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to US$81.4 billion]],{{efn|Constant [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] US dollars, base year 2015.}} or US$43,430 per capita (purchasing power parity).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=FUA_CITY |title=City statistics : Economy |author=[[OECD]]|access-date=16 January 2023}}</ref>

===Port===
{{main|Marseille-Fos Port|Old Port of Marseille|Docks (Marseille)}}
[[File:1 marseille vieux port pano.jpg|thumb|upright=2|The entrance to the Old Port, flanked by Fort Saint-Jean and Fort Saint-Nicolas]]
Historically, the economy of Marseille was dominated by its role as a port of the French Empire, linking the North African colonies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with [[Metropolitan France]]. The [[Old Port of Marseille|Old Port]] was replaced as the main port for trade by the Port de la Joliette (now part of [[Marseille-Fos Port]]) during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] and now contains restaurants, offices, bars and hotels and functions mostly as a private marina. The majority of the port and [[Docks (Marseille)|docks]], which experienced decline in the 1970s after the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], have been recently redeveloped with funds from the [[European Union]]. Fishing remains important in Marseille and the food economy of Marseille is fed by the local catch; a daily fish market is still held on the [[Old Port of Marseille|Quai des Belges]] of the Old Port.

The economy of Marseille and its region is still linked to its commercial port, the first French port and the fifth [[List of busiest ports in Europe|European port by cargo tonnage]], which lies north of the Old Port and eastern in [[Fos-sur-Mer]]. Some 45,000 jobs are linked to the port activities and it represents €4&nbsp;billion of added value to the regional economy.<ref name="fos">{{Cite web |date=5 February 2013 |title=Record Container Year as Marseilles Fos Sets Vision for Future |url=http://www.marseille-port.fr/en/Content/Documents/Presse/2013/10/news_port_marseille_fos_0502_2013.pdf |access-date=8 March 2013 |website=Port of Marseille-Fos}}</ref> 100&nbsp;million tons of [[Cargo|freight]] pass annually through the port, 60% of which is petroleum, making it number one in France and the Mediterranean and number three in Europe.

[[File:Secteurs de Marseille 2014.svg|thumb|Political majority in each sector since 2014]]
The city of Marseille is divided into 16 [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]], which are themselves informally divided into 111 neighbourhoods (French: ''quartiers''). The arrondissements are regrouped in pairs, into 8 sectors, each with a mayor and council (like the arrondissements in [[Arrondissements of Paris|Paris]] and [[Arrondissements of Lyon|Lyon]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mairies d'Arrondissements |url=http://www.marseille.fr/vdm/cms/accueil/mairie/mairie_arrondissements |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105082851/http://www.marseille.fr/vdm/cms/accueil/mairie/mairie_arrondissements |archive-date=5 January 2009 |access-date=16 November 2007 |language=fr}}</ref> Municipal elections are held every six years and are carried out by sector. There are 303 councilmembers in total, two-thirds sitting in the sector councils and one third in the city council.

The [[9th arrondissement of Marseille]] is the largest in terms of area because it comprises parts of [[Calanques National Park]]. With a population of 89,316 (2007), the [[13th arrondissement of Marseille]] is the most populous one.

From 1950 to the mid-1990s, Marseille was a [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] (PS) and [[French Communist Party|Communist]] (PCF) stronghold. [[Gaston Defferre]] (PS) was consecutively reelected six times as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 until his death in 1986. He was succeeded by [[Robert Vigouroux]] of the [[European Democratic and Social Rally]] (RDSE). [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]] of the conservative [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] was elected Mayor of Marseille in 1995. Gaudin was reelected in 2001, 2008 and 2014.

In recent years, the Communist Party has lost most of its strength in the northern boroughs of the city, whereas the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] has received significant support. At the [[2014 French municipal elections|last municipal election]] in 2014, Marseille was divided between the northern arrondissements dominated by the left (PS) and far-right (FN) and the southern part of town dominated by the conservative (UMP). Marseille is also divided in [[Cantons of Marseille|twelve cantons]], each of them sending two members to the [[Departmental councils (France)|Departmental Council]] of the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] [[Departments of France|department]].

Because of its pre-eminence as a Mediterranean port, Marseille has always been one of the main gateways into France. This has attracted many immigrants and made Marseille a cosmopolitan [[melting pot]]. By the end of the 18th century about half the population originated from elsewhere in Provence mostly and also from southern France.<ref>{{harvnb|Liauzu|1996}}</ref>{{sfn|Duchêne|Contrucci|1998|loc=page needed E}}{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

Economic conditions and political unrest in Europe and the rest of the world brought several other waves of immigrants during the 20th century: Greeks and Italians started arriving at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, up to 40% of the city's population was of Italian origin;<ref name="eu">{{Cite web |title=Local0631EN:Quality0667EN |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2006/31/en/1/ef0631en.pdf |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> Russians in 1917; Armenians in 1915 and 1923; Vietnamese in the 1920s, 1954 and after 1975;<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guillemin, Alain |title=Les Vietnamiens a Marseille |url=http://newvietart.net/index4.3.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323092304/http://newvietart.net/index4.3.html |archive-date=23 March 2014 |language=fr}}</ref> [[Corsica]]ns during the 1920s and 1930s; Spanish after 1936; [[Maghrebis]] (both [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]]) in the [[interwar period|inter-war period]]; Sub-Saharan Africans after 1945; [[Maghrebi Jews]] in the 1950s and 1960s; the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]] from the former [[French Algeria]] in 1962; and then from [[Comoros]].

At the 2019 census, 81.4% of the inhabitants of the Marseille [[Functional area (France)|metropolitan area]] were natives of [[Metropolitan France]], 0.6% were born in [[Overseas France]], and 18.0% were born in foreign countries (two-fifth of whom French citizens from birth, in particular [[Pieds-Noirs]] from Algeria arrived in Metropolitan France after the independence of Algeria in 1962).<ref name=immig_1 /> A quarter of the immigrants living in the Marseille metropolitan area were born in Europe (half of them in Italy, Portugal, and Spain), 46% were born in the [[Maghreb]] (almost two-third of them in Algeria), 14% in the rest of Africa (almost half of them in the [[Indian Ocean]] islands of [[Comoros]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Mauritius]], not counting those born in [[Réunion]] and [[Mayotte]] who are not legally immigrants), and 15.0% in the rest of the world (not counting those born in the [[Overseas departments and regions of France|French overseas departments]] of the Americas and in the French territories of the South Pacific, who are not legally immigrants).<ref name=immig_2 />

The largest immigrant communities (including descendants) in 2002 were Italians (290,000 Italians, or 33%), then Muslims - mainly Maghrebis (200,000 Muslims, or 23%), then Corsicans (100,000 Corsicans, or 11.5%), then Armenians (80,000 Armenians, or 9%).<ref name=":3" />

In 1999, in several arrondissements, about 40% of the young people under 18 were of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Michèle Tribalat |date=2007 |title=Les concentrations ethniques en France |url=http://www.societe-de-strategie.asso.fr/pdf/agir28txt4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916215150/http://www.societe-de-strategie.asso.fr/pdf/agir28txt4.pdf |archive-date=16 September 2011}}</ref>

Since 2013 a significant number of Central- and Eastern European immigrants have settled in Marseille, attracted by better job opportunities and the good climate of this Mediterranean city. The main nationalities of the immigrants are Romanian and Polish.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Insee – Population – Les immigrés récemment arrivés en France – Une immigration de plus en plus européenne |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=ip1524 |website=insee.fr}}</ref>

Marseille is a city that has its own unique culture and is proud of its differences from the rest of France.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chris Kimble |title=Marseille Culture |url=http://marseillecityofculture.eu/marseille-culture.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501040521/http://marseillecityofculture.eu/marseille-culture.html |archive-date=1 May 2013 |access-date=5 May 2013 |publisher=Marseillecityofculture.eu}}</ref> Today it is a regional centre for culture and entertainment with an important [[Opéra de Marseille|opera house]], historical and maritime museums, five art galleries and numerous cinemas, clubs, bars and restaurants.

Marseille has a large number of theatres, including La Criée, Le Gymnase and the Théâtre Toursky. There is also an extensive [[arts centre]] in [[La Friche]], a former match factory behind the Saint-Charles station. The [[Alcazar (Marseille)|Alcazar]], until the 1960s a well known [[music hall]] and [[Variety show|variety theatre]], has recently been completely remodelled behind its original façade and now houses the central municipal library.<ref>[https://www.bmvr.marseille.fr/patrimoine/a-l-origine History of library]</ref> Other music venues in Marseille include Le Silo (also a theatre) and [[GRIM]].

Marseille has also been important in the arts. It has been the birthplace and home of many French writers and poets, including {{Interlanguage link|Victor Gélu|fr}}, [[Valère Bernard]], [[Pierre Bertas]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pierre Bertas |url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n87144504/}}</ref> [[Edmond Rostand]] and [[André Roussin]]. The small port of [[l'Estaque]] on the far end of the Bay of Marseille became a favourite haunt for artists, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Auguste Renoir]], [[Paul Cézanne]] (who frequently visited from his home in [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]]), [[Georges Braque]] and [[Raoul Dufy]].

=== Multi-cultural influences ===
Rich and poor neighborhoods exist side by side. Although the city is not without crime, Marseille has a larger degree of multicultural tolerance. Urban geographers<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Ingram |first=Mark |date=2009 |title=Euro-Mediterranean Marseille: Redefining State Cultural Policy in an Era of Transnational Governance |magazine=City & Society |volume=21 |pages=268–292}}</ref> say the city's geography, being surrounded by mountains, helps explain why Marseille does not have the same problems as Paris. In Paris, ethnic areas are segregated and concentrated in the periphery of the city. Residents of Marseille are of diverse origins, yet appear to share a similar particular identity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moreau |first=Alain |title=Migrations, identités, et territoires à Marseille.Migrations, identités, et territoires à Marseille |publisher=Hamattan |year=2001 |location=Paris |pages=27–52}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine |last=Dickey |first=Christopher |date=March 2012 |title=Marseille's Melting Pot |magazine=National Geographic Magazine |volume=2012 |number=3}}</ref> An example is how Marseille responded in 2005, when ethnic populations living in other French cities' suburbs [[2005 French riots|rioted]], but Marseille remained relatively calm.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Williams |first=D |date=27 October 2005 |title=Long Integrated, Marseille Is Spared.

Early on, immigrants came to Marseille locally from the surrounding Provence region. By the 1890s immigrants came from other regions of France as well as Italy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=Peter |title=European Cities and Towns |publisher=Oxford |year=2009 |location=Oxford, England |pages=283, 247}}</ref> Marseille became one of Europe's busiest ports by 1900.<ref name=":0" /> Marseille has served as a major port where immigrants from around the Mediterranean arrive.<ref name=":1" /> Marseille continued to be multicultural. Armenians from the Ottoman Empire began arriving in 1913. In the 1930s, Italians settled in Marseille. After World War II, a wave of Jewish immigrants from North Africa arrived. In 1962, a number of French colonies gained their independence, and the French citizens from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia arrived in Marseille.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |date=4 October 2013 |title=Marseille, the Secret Capital of France |work=The New York Times}}</ref> The city had an economic downturn and lost many jobs. Those who could afford to move left and the poorest remained. For a while, the mafia appeared to run the city, and for a period of time the communist party was prominent.<ref name=":2" />

Multi-cultural Marseille can be observed by a visitor at the market at Noailles, also called Marché des Capucins, in old town near the Old Port. There, Lebanese bakeries, an African spice market, Chinese and Vietnamese groceries, fresh vegetables and fruit, shops selling couscous, shops selling Caribbean food are side by side with stalls selling shoes and clothing from around the Mediterranean. Nearby, people sell fresh fish and men from Tunisia drink tea.<ref name=":2" />

Although most Armenians arrived after the [[Armenian Genocide]], Armenians had a long presence even before the 20th and late 19th centuries. Armenians, having an extensive trade network worldwide, massively traded with Marseille and its port. Most notably, during the 16th century, and after the Armenians gained a monopoly over Iranian silk, which was granted to them by Shah Abbas of Iran, the trade flow of Armenians of Marseille increased tremendously.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} Merchants of Armenian origin received trade privileges in France by Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu (1585–1642) and later on Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683) Marseille a free port in 1669. One notable Armenian-Iranian merchant gained a patent from Louis XIV (1638–1715) over Iranian silk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/european-networks/economic-networks/tamara-ganjalyan-armenian-trade-networks|title=Armenian trade networks}}</ref> Armenians also became successful money-lenders and bankers in the city. Due to these policies and the multiculturalism of the city of Marseille, Armenians became very wealthy, and the legacy of the Armenians in the city still lives on.

===Tarot de Marseille===
[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 13.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tarot of Marseilles|Marseille tarot card]]]]
The most commonly used [[tarot]] deck takes its name from the city; it has been called the ''[[Tarot of Marseille|Tarot de Marseille]]'' since the 1930s—a name coined for commercial use by the French cardmaker and cartomancer Paul Marteau, owner of B–P Grimaud. Previously this deck was called ''Tarot italien'' (Italian Tarot) and even earlier it was simply called Tarot. Before being ''de Marseille'', it was used to play the local variant of [[tarot|tarocchi]] before it became used in [[cartomancy]] at the end of the 18th century, following the trend set by [[Antoine Court de Gébelin]]. The name ''Tarot de Marseille'' (Marteau used the name ''ancien Tarot de Marseille'') was used by contrast to other types of Tarots such as ''Tarot de [[Besançon]]''; those names were simply associated with cities where there were many cardmakers in the 18th century (previously several cities in France were involved in cardmaking).<ref>see:

Another local tradition is the making of [[santon (figurine)|santons]], small hand-crafted figurines for the traditional Provençal Christmas [[Nativity scene|creche]]. Since 1803, starting on the last Sunday of November, there has been a Santon Fair in Marseille; it is currently held in the Cours d'Estienne d'Orves, a large square off the Vieux-Port.

===Opera===
[[File:Laika ac Marseille (9491261832).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Opéra de Marseille]]]]
Marseille's main cultural attraction was, since its creation at the end of the 18th century and until the late 1970s, the [[Opéra de Marseille|Opéra]]. Located near the Old Port and the Canebière, at the very heart of the city, its [[architectural style]] was comparable to the classical trend found in other opera houses built at the same time in [[Lyon]] and [[Bordeaux]]. In 1919, a fire almost completely destroyed the house, leaving only the stone [[colonnade]] and [[peristyle]] from the original façade.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Opera in Genoa, Nice, Marseille, Montpellier, Barcelona |url=http://www.capsuropera.com/seasonschedules.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223222843/http://www.capsuropera.com/seasonschedules.php |archive-date=23 December 2008 |access-date=5 May 2009 |publisher=Capsuropera.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Schmap Marseille Sights & Attractions – 6th arrond |url=http://www.schmap.com/marseille/sights_6tharrond/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430013244/http://www.schmap.com/marseille/sights_6tharrond/ |archive-date=30 April 2008 |access-date=5 May 2009 |publisher=Schmap.com}}</ref> The classical façade was restored and the opera house reconstructed in a predominantly [[Art Deco]] style, as the result of a major competition. Currently the Opéra de Marseille stages six or seven operas each year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Actualités |url=http://opera.marseille.fr/ |website=Opéra de Marseille |language=fr}}</ref>

Since 1972, the [[Ballet national de Marseille]] has performed at the opera house; its director from its foundation to 1998 was [[Roland Petit]].

===Popular events and festivals===

There are several popular festivals in different neighborhoods, with concerts, animations, and outdoor bars, like the Fête du Panier in June. On 21 June, there are dozens of free concerts in the city as part of France's [[Fête de la Musique]], featuring music from all over the world. Being free events, many Marseille residents attend.

Marseille hosts a Gay Pride event in early July. In 2013, Marseille hosted [[Europride]], an international [[LGBT]] event, 10 July{{ndash}}20.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marseille 2013 |url=http://www.europride.com/en/archives/marseille-2013/ |access-date=20 April 2015 |website=EuroPride|date=28 June 2013 }}</ref> At the beginning of July, there is the International Documentary Festival.<ref>{{Cite web |title=March 2013 Newsletter |url=http://www.fidmarseille.org/dynamic/index.php?lang=english |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007235027/http://www.fidmarseille.org/dynamic/index.php?lang=english |archive-date=7 October 2012 |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher=FIDMarseille}}</ref> At the end of September, the electronic music festival [[Marsatac]] takes place.

===Hip hop music===
Marseille is also well known in France for its [[French hip hop|hip hop music]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/arts/music/19rap.html?pagewanted=all "In Marseille, Rap Helps Keep the Peace"], Article in [[New York Times]], December 2007

Other known groups include [[Fonky Family]], [[Psy 4 de la Rime]] (including rappers [[Soprano (rapper)|Soprano]] and [[Alonzo (rapper)|Alonzo]]), and [[Keny Arkana]].
In a slightly different way, [[ragga music]] is represented by [[Massilia Sound System]].

===Films set in Marseille===
{{main|List of films set in Marseille}}

Marseille has been the setting for many films.

==Main sights==
Marseille is listed as a major centre of art and history. The city has many museums and galleries and there are many ancient buildings and churches of historical interest.

===Central Marseille===
[[File:L'Hôtel de Ville (Marseille) (14181557102).jpg|thumb|Le Panier quarter with the [[Hôtel de Ville, Marseille|Hotel de Ville]] and the church of Notre-Dame des Accoules]]

[[File:Christian Marseille.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|Abbey of St. Victor]] and the [[basilica]] of [[Notre-Dame de la Garde]]]]
Most of the attractions of Marseille (including shopping areas) are located in the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th arrondissements. These include:{{sfn|Trott|2007|pp=251–253}}<ref name="highlights">{{Cite web |title=The Highlights |url=http://www.marseille-tourisme.com/en/discover-marseille/the-essentials/ |website=Office de tourisme Marseille}}</ref>

* The Old Port or Vieux-Port, the main harbour and marina of the city. It is guarded by two massive forts (Fort Saint-Nicolas and [[Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]]) and is one of the main places to eat in the city. Dozens of cafés line the waterfront. The Quai des Belges at the end of the harbour is the site of the daily fish market. Much of the northern quayside area was rebuilt by the architect Fernand Pouillon after its destruction by the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s in 1943.
* The [[Hôtel de Ville, Marseille|Hôtel de Ville]] (City Hall), a [[baroque]] building dating from the 17th century.
* The Centre Bourse and the adjacent Rue St Ferreol district (including Rue de Rome and Rue Paradis), the main shopping area in central Marseille.
*The [[Porte d'Aix]], a [[triumphal arch]] commemorating French victories in the [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|Spanish Expedition]].
* The Hôtel-Dieu, a former hospital in ''Le Panier'', transformed into an [[InterContinental]] hotel in 2013.
* [[La Vieille Charité]] in ''Le Panier'', an architecturally significant building designed by the Puget brothers. The central baroque chapel is situated in a courtyard lined with arcaded galleries. Originally built as an [[Almshouse|alms house]], it is now home to an archeological museum and a gallery of African and Asian art, as well as bookshops and a café. It also houses the Marseille International Poetry Centre.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Présentation du CiPM |url=http://www.cipmarseille.com/presentation.php |website=Centre international de la Poèsie, Marseille (CiPM) |language=fr}}</ref>
* The [[Marseille Cathedral|Cathedral of Sainte-Marie-Majeure]] or La Major, founded in the fourth century, enlarged in the 11th century and completely rebuilt in the second half of the 19th century by the architects [[Léon Vaudoyer]] and [[Henri-Jacques Espérandieu]]. The present day cathedral is a gigantic edifice in Romano-Byzantine style. A [[romanesque architecture|romanesque]] [[transept]], [[choir]] and [[altar]] survive from the older medieval cathedral, spared from complete destruction only as a result of public protests at the time.
* The 12th-century [[parish church]] of [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint-Laurent]] and adjoining 17th-century chapel of Sainte-Catherine, on the quayside near the cathedral.
* The [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|Abbey of Saint-Victor]], one of the oldest places of [[Christian worship]] in Europe. Its fifth-century [[crypt]] and [[catacombs]] occupy the site of a [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] burial ground, later used for [[Early Christianity|Christian]] martyrs and venerated ever since. Continuing a [[Mary Magdalene#Speculations|medieval tradition]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Christmas Time |url=http://www.marseille-tourisme.com/en/discover-marseille/tradition/christmas-time/ |website=Office de tourisme Marseille}}</ref> every year at [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Candlemas]] a [[Black Madonna]] from the crypt is carried in procession along Rue Sainte for a blessing from the archbishop, followed by a mass and the distribution of "navettes" and green [[votive candle]]s.

===Museums===
In addition to the two in the Centre de la Vieille Charité, described above, the main museums are:{{sfn|Trott|2007|pp=264–267}}

* The [[Musée des Civilisations de l'Europe et de la Méditerranée]] (MuCEM) and the Villa Méditerranée were inaugurated in 2013.
