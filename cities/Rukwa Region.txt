According to the 2022 national census, the region had a population of 1,540,519.<ref name="2012 Census">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf |title=Population Distribution by Administrative Units, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013 |access-date=2013-07-24 |archive-date=2013-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015224549/http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Tanzania: Regions and Cities - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/tanzania/cities/ |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> 

==History==
The region's name comes from [[Lake Rukwa]], it was established in 1975 by President [[Julius Nyerere]] by taking [[Mpanda District]] from the Tabora Region and the former unified Sumbawanga District from the Mbeya Region. Nkasi District was established in 1984.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania - Ofisi ya Waziri Mkuu - Tawala za Mikoa na Serikali za Mitaa: (The United Republic of Tanzania - Prime Minister's Office - Regional Administration and Local Government) Nkasi District - Introduction | year=2008 | publisher=Rukwa Regional Commissioner's Office | url=http://www.rukwa.go.tz/kurasa/halmashauri/lga3/index.php | access-date=2012-08-31 | archive-date=2016-03-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234734/http://www.rukwa.go.tz/kurasa/halmashauri/lga3/index.php | url-status=live }}</ref> In 2012, the region was reorganized with the Mpanda District going to the new [[Katavi Region]].

==Geography==
The Rukwa region has a total surface area of 27,765 km<sup>2</sup>, of which 6,605 km2 (23.79%) is made up of water bodies and 21,160 km<sup>2</sup> (76.21%) is made up of land.
[[Nkasi District]], which makes up 47.27 percent of the region's total area, and [[Sumbawanga Rural District|Sumbawanga District]], which makes up 36.74 percent, dominate the distribution of the region's area among the districts. The smallest district is [[Kalambo District|Kalambo]], which makes up only 15.99% of the region's total area. <ref>{{Cite web | date=March 2016 | title=Rukwa Region Stratigic Plan | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa | url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/59c/a1d/37b/59ca1d37b45f4477455287.pdf|access-date=2022-10-09}}</ref>

Three significant superficial geological deposits can be found in the Rukwa Region. In the high areas, these are the sandy soils, shallow, dispersed clayey [[Lacustrine deposits|lacustrines]], and [[Ferrallitic|ferralitic]] soils. Western Tanzania is where the Rukwa Region is located. Malonje in the [[Ufipa Plateau|Ufipa plateau]] has the highest point in the area at 2,461 meters above sea level, and Lake Tanganyika has the lowest point at 773 meters above sea level. The [[Miombo]] Woodlands, which predominate in Sumbawanga and Nkasi and are home to commercially valuable trees like Mninga (Pterocarpus angolensis) and Mputu, making up the majority of Rukwa Region's vegetation.<ref>{{Cite web | date=March 2016 | title=Rukwa Region Stratigic Plan | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa | url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/59c/a1d/37b/59ca1d37b45f4477455287.pdf|access-date=2022-10-09}}</ref>

===Climate===
The region has a [[tropical climate]], with average monthly highs of 27°C in October and December and lows of 13°C in some locations in June and July. Rukwa region has had consistent, [[Unimodality|unimodal rainfall]] for many years; falling from November through May, ranging from 800 to 1300 mm annually. Following the [[rainy season]], the [[dry season]] lasts into October.<ref>{{Cite web | date=March 2016 | title=Rukwa Region Stratigic Plan | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa | url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/59c/a1d/37b/59ca1d37b45f4477455287.pdf|access-date=2022-10-09}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[Agriculture]] (crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry), tourism, and mining make up the majority of the region's producing industries. The Rukwa Region's population relies on agriculture for about 80% of their income. There are 1,660,600 ha of [[Arable land|arable]] land and only 447,079 ha (or about 32% of arable land) are under cultivation.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

Rukwa Region's [[GDP]] at current market prices increased by 1,529,289, 2,407,234 and 2,677,131 in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, the per capita income was 974,601, 1,485,563 and 1,599,845 respectively. From 2003 and 2012, the sustained GDP growth rate ranged from 7 to 18 percent on average. Despite the region being dominated by agriculture, [[Gemstone|gemstones]] like [[emerald]] and others are abundant in Rukwa. The region has large variety of industrial and base metal minerals, including kaolin, quartz, graphite, tin, limonite, copper, and cobalt. <ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa|url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref> 

===Agriculture===
Rukwa is an agrarian society where agriculture accounts for around 80% of people's daily income. Maize, paddy, beans, wheat, millet, and cassava are among of the crops that are grown. [[Common sunflower|Sunflower]], groundnuts, sesame, barley, and other vegetables are among the others. Although agriculture is not yet fully mechanized, the trend indicates that there is an excess of certain crops, notably maize, paddy, [[cassava]], sunflower, and sesame. Smallholder farmers who work between 0.5 and 2.0 ha account for 68 percent of the farmed area in the Rukwa region and are the main form of agriculture.
<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

A total of 72,915 ha in the region have the capacity to be irrigated; however, only 5,768 ha of that total—or 7.9 percent of the irrigable land—can now be irrigated. There are 25 possible [[irrigation]] scheme sites in the region, of which 9 have been constructed for contemporary irrigation facilities and 16 are under traditional irrigation. A 20% GDP contribution from livestock is made in the Rukwa region. Each family of farmers keeps 12 cattle on average. A massive inflow of agro pastoralists from [[Tabora Region|Tabora]], [[Shinyanga Region|Shinyanga]], and [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]] have, however, moved into the area during the past ten years in search of pasture for their animals. Each household of the migrating pastoralists keeps 100 to 300 cattle on average. There are currently 446,746 cattle in the Rukwa region, according to estimates. The region's growing cattle population presents an opportunity for the development of enterprises that process livestock products.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

In the Rukwa region, there are two ranches and one dairy farm. Heritage Farm is the owner of the dairy farm in the Sumbawanga Municipality's Malonje. The beef ranches in Nkundi and Kalambo are owned by SAAFI and NARCO, respectively. Rukwa region only has 1,103 improved [[dairy]] animals, or 0.27% of the 399,025 dairy animals in the nation, according to the sample census from 2002/2003. According to the most recent data (2013/2014 reports), there are 537 dairy goats and 7,061 dairy cattle in the Rukwa region.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

In the Rukwa region, 102,260 tons of fish were produced between 1997 and 2002, totaling TZS 3.453 billion. 99 percent of the fish are captured in the Nkasi district. There are two large lakes in the area, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Rukwa. Other smaller lakes and rivers exist. [[Sardine|Sardines]], [[tilapia]], nile perch, mud fish,  luciolates strapessil "Migebuka," and numerous ornamental fish species are among the varieties of fish that may be found in the region.In the Muze community, which is close to Lake Rukwa, crocodile farming is done on a modest scale.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
There are 2,512.73 km of roads in the area. Only 106.70 km and 676.65 km of the 2,512.73 km total length of the road network are paved. The remaining roads are earthen ones that are kept up. The LGAs (Local government) are in charge of the remaining network while TANROADS manages the trunk and regional roads. The Kalambo district has the fewest roads, whereas Sumbawanga Municipality has the most.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

Along the shores of Lake Tanganyika and Lake Rukwa, marine transportation is an important factor in the movement of people and goods. On Lake Tanganyika, two commercial vessels—the Mwongozo and the Liemba—serve the communities of Kabwe, Korongwe, Ninde, Wampembe, Kala, Kirando, Kipili, and Kasanga. They are unreliable, though. Ships are required to anchor some distance from the beach (about 1 to 1.5 nautical miles) with the exception of Kasanga, where there is a landing platform; as a result, goods and passengers must be brought to the ships by small boats. Marine services connect the territory to the neighboring nations of Zambia, the Congo DR, and Burundi as well as the neighboring Regions of Katavi and [[Kigoma Region|Kigoma]]. Only boats are permitted for transportation within Lake Rukwa.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

In Rukwa Region, there is just one (1) public airport and four (4) private airstrips. The Sumbawanga Municipal Council is home to the public airport. The region is served by only two commercial flights, according to [[Tanzania Airports Authority]] (TAA). As of [[mass communication]], In the Rukwa Region, twelve radio stations are accessible. As for water, according to the population and housing census from 2012, protected wells were the primary source of drinking water for 49.4% of all private homes. In Sumbawanga Municipal Council and Namanyere Town, which includes nine villages of Nkasi DC, electricity is provided by TANESCO. Only 7% of families in the area consume power provided by [[TANESCO]], according to a 2002 Household Budget Survey. TANESCO intends to expand in rural areas through REA. Hydropower from Zambia and thermal electricity generating facilities in Sumbawanga Municipality are the sources of this electricity.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa |url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

===Mining===
While there are extensive mineral resources in the Rukwa Region,<ref name="Mining">{{Cite web | title=Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania - Ofisi ya Waziri Mkuu - Tawala za Mikoa na Serikali za Mitaa: (The United Republic of Tanzania - Prime Minister's Office - Regional Administration and Local Government) Natural Resources - Mining | year=2008 | publisher=Rukwa Regional Commissioner's Office | url=http://www.rukwa.go.tz/kurasa/maliasili_mazingira/maliasili/index.php | access-date=2012-08-31 | archive-date=2016-03-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215902/http://www.rukwa.go.tz/kurasa/maliasili_mazingira/maliasili/index.php | url-status=live }}</ref> there are no active large mines. Gem stones, including [[emerald]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[Beryl#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]], [[amethyst]], [[ruby]], and [[topaz]], have been recovered from a number of locations.<ref name="Mining"/> There are coal seams in the Muze, Namwele, and Mkomolo areas, and some mining has occurred there.<ref name="Mining"/>

===Tourism and Reserves===
Due to its abundance of natural tourist resources, Rukwa can claim of exceptional tourist attractions. These include the Old Bismark Fort at Kasanga, the Kalambo Falls, the Hot Springs of Kizombwe, the shore of Lake Tanganyika, the Mbizi forest, Lake Kwela, and Ntembwa Falls. There are only two game reserves in the area, Lwafi (2200 km2) and [[Uwanda Game Reserve|Uwanda]] (2200 km2), as well as one game controlled area, Kwela (500 km sq). On average, 1.4% of the area is covered by natural forest reserves. The Miombo Woodlands, which predominate in the Sumbawanga and Nkasi districts and include commercially significant timber like Mninga ([[Pterocarpus angolensis]]) and Mputu, are where forest products are gathered.<ref>{{Cite web | date=October 2014 | title=Rukwa Investment Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa|url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/58d/4ce/a5c/58d4cea5c0ccf531557820.pdf|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref>

==Population==
Population growth in the Rukwa region is accelerated in part by an inflow of migrants from other areas looking for better prospects there. Approximately 25% of the people of the Region are recent migrants from other regions of Tanzania. Fipa and a small number of other tribes, including [[Mambwe people|Mambwe]], [[Lungu people|Lungu]], [[Nyiha people|Nyiha]] and, [[Lyangalile]], initially dominated the area and are the native inhabitants. The Regional population in 2012 was 1,004,539, with 487,311 males and 517,228 females. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) predicts that in 2017, the population will be 1,192,373, with 578,431 males and 613,942 females, growing at a 3.2% annual rate.<ref>{{Cite web | date=March 2016 | title=Rukwa Region Stratigic Plan | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Sumbawanga, Rukwa| url=https://rukwa.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/59c/a1d/37b/59ca1d37b45f4477455287.pdf|access-date=2022-10-09}}</ref>
