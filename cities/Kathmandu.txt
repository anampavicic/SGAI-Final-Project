== Etymology ==

The indigenous [[Newar language|Nepal Bhasa]] term for Kathmandu is ''Yen''.{{cn|date=October 2024}} The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] name ''Kathmandu'' comes from [[Kasthamandap]], a building that stood in [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] and was completely destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|April 2015 Nepal Earthquake]] (it has since been reconstructed). In [[Sanskrit]], {{Transliteration|sa|Kāṣṭha}} ({{langx|sa|काष्ठ}}) means "wood" and {{Transliteration|sa|Maṇḍapa}} ({{langx|sa|मण्डप}}) means "pavilion". This public pavilion, also known as ''Maru Satta'' in Newari, was rebuilt in 1596 by Biseth in the period of King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. The three-storey structure was made entirely of wood and used no iron nails nor supports. According to legends, all the timber used to build the [[pagoda]] was obtained from a single tree.<ref name=introd>{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=1&pr_id=1 |title=Introduction |access-date=12 December 2009 |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal |archive-date=24 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190236/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=1&pr_id=1 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[colophon (publishing)|colophons]] of ancient manuscripts, dated as late as the 20th century, refer to Kathmandu as {{Transliteration|ne|Kāṣṭhamaṇḍap Mahānagar}} in [[Nepal Mandala]]. Mahānagar means "great city". The city is called {{Transliteration|ne|Kāṣṭhamaṇḍap}} in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as {{Transliteration|ne|Kāṣṭhamaṇḍap}}. During medieval times, the city was sometimes called [[Kantipur|Kāntipur]] ({{langx|sa|कान्तिपुर}}). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words – {{Transliteration|sa|Kānti}} and {{Transliteration|sa|Pur}}. {{Transliteration|sa|Kānti}} is a word that stands for "beauty" and is mostly associated with light and {{Transliteration|sa|Pur}} means place, thus giving it the meaning, "City of light".

Among the indigenous Newar people, Kathmandu is known as ''Yeṃ Dey'' ({{Langx|new|येँ देय्}}), and Patan and Bhaktapur are known as ''Yala Dey'' ({{Langx|new|यल देय्}}) and ''Khwopa Dey'' ({{Langx|new|ख्वप देय्}}) respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirkpatrick |first=Colonel |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ijxAAAAAYAAJ |title=An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul |publisher=London: William Miller |year=1811 |access-date=9 March 2012 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ijxAAAAAYAAJ/page/n191 159]}} pp. 162–63</ref> "Yen" is the shorter form of ''Yambu'' ({{Langx|new|यम्बु}}), which originally referred to the northern half of Kathmandu.

=== Ancient history ===

The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional [[myths]] and [[legend]]s. According to the [[Swayambhu Purana]], present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake named "[[Nagdaha]]", as it was full of snakes. The lake was cut drained by [[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]] with his sword, and the water was evacuated out from there. He then established a city called Manjupattan, and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land. After some time, a demon named [[Banasura]] closed the outlet, and the valley again turned into a lake. [[Krishna]] came to Nepal, killed Banasura, and again drained out the water by cutting the edge of Chobhar hill with this [[Sudarshana Chakra]]. He brought some cowherds along with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal.<ref name=prehistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=4&pr_id=4 |title=History |access-date=12 December 2009 |publisher=Government of Nepal |archive-date=7 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107015826/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=4&pr_id=4 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="travel">{{cite web |url=http://www.newatravels.com/nepal/index.html |title=History:Ancient Nepal |website=Newa Travels and Tours |publisher=New Travels and Tours Ltd |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721111831/http://www.newatravels.com/nepal/index.html |archive-date=21 July 2009 |access-date=18 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="nepalmandal.com">{{cite web |last=Apr |url=http://www.nepalmandal.com/content/7752.html |title=Article:झीसं पत्याः यानाच्वनागु अन्धविश्वास – Author:विपेन्द्र महर्जन Nepalmandal |publisher=Nepalmandal.com |date=21 April 2010 |access-date=15 January 2012 |archive-date=3 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203210240/http://www.nepalmandal.com/content/7752.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Kotirudra Samhita of [[Shiva Purana]], Chapter 11, ''Shloka'' 18 refers to the place as Nayapala city, which was famous for its [[Pashupati]] Shivalinga. The name Nepal probably originates from this city Nayapala.

Very few historical records exists of the period before medieval [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi rulers]]. According to [[Gopalraj Vansawali]], a genealogy of Nepali monarchy, the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were [[Pala empire|Gopalas]], Mahispalas, Aabhirs, [[Kirati people |Kirat]], and Somavanshi.<ref name="nepalmandal.com"/><ref>Article:गोपालराज वंशावली Language: Nepalbhasa, Journal:नेपालभाषा केन्द्रीय विभागया जर्नल, Edition:1, Date: 1998, pp. 18–25, 44</ref> The Kirata dynasty was established by [[Yalambar|Yalamber]]. During the Kirata era, a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu. In some of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan. During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler, Jitedasti, Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at [[Sankhu]].[[File:Kathmandu durbar square.jpg|thumb|Kathmandu Durbar Square, 1852]]

==== Licchavi era ====

The Licchavis from [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaisali]] in  modern-day [[Bihar]], migrated north and defeated the [[Kirat people|Kirats]], establishing the Licchavi dynasty, circa 400 AD. During this era, following the genocide of [[Shakya]]s in [[Lumbini]] by [[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]], the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery, masquerading as Koliyas. From Sankhu, they migrated to Yambu and Yengal (Lanjagwal and Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu. This created the basis of [[Newar Buddhism]], which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dsbcproject.org/manuscripts/short-history |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130414141212/http://www.dsbcproject.org/manuscripts/short-history |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 April 2013 |title=A Short History of Sanskrit Buddhist Manuscripts |publisher=Dsbcproject.org |access-date=24 November 2013}}</ref> With their migration, Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward+No.+23_38 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622181813/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward%2BNo.%2B23_38 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 June 2012 |title=Kathmandu Metropolitan City |publisher=Kathmandu.gov.np |access-date=24 November 2013}}</ref> during most of the Licchavi era.<ref name="काष्ठमण्डप कि होममण्डप">{{cite web |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=37878&cat_id=22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706165415/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=37878&cat_id=22 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 July 2012 |title=काष्ठमण्डप कि होममण्डप |publisher=Gorkhapatra.org.np |access-date=24 November 2013}}</ref>

Eventually, the Licchavi ruler [[Gunakamadeva]] merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram, founding the city of Kathmandu.<ref name="काष्ठमण्डप कि होममण्डप" /> The city was designed in the shape of ''Chandrahrasa'', the sword of Manjushri. The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by [[Ajima]]s. One of these barracks is still in use at [[Bhadrakali Temple (Kathmandu)|Bhadrakali]] (in front of [[Singha Durbar]]). The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet, leading to tremendous growth in architecture. Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travellers and monks who lived during this era. For example, the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] described Kailaskut Bhawan, the palace of the Licchavi king [[Amshuverma]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120203517/http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 January 2012 |title=राष्ट्रपति अचानक ग्यालरीमा &#124; कला र शैली &#124; :: कान्तिपुर |publisher=Ekantipur.com |access-date=15 January 2012}}</ref> The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well. The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era, both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas. Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia, creating religious art for their neighbours. For example, [[Araniko]] led a group of his compatriot artists through [[Tibet]] and China. [[Bhrikuti]], the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch [[Songtsen Gampo|Songtsän Gampo]], was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet.

==== Malla era ====

[[File:Kathmandu 1811 high (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Skyline of Kathmandu, {{c.|1811}}|205x205px]]
[[File:View of the Kathmandu Valley from Swayambhunath stupa.png|thumb|View of the Kathmandu valley from [[Swayambhunath]], 1863]]
The Licchavi era was followed by the [[Malla (Kathmandu Valley)|Malla era]]. Rulers from [[Tirhut]], upon being attacked by the [[Delhi Sultanate]], fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from [[Khasas|Khas]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turk Muslims]]. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu's population, including the king [[Abhaya Malla]]. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and [[Kailashkut Bhawan]]), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between India and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.

During the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, esthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of waterspouts, the institutionalisation of trusts (called [[guthi]]s), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription farom the time of king [[Pratap Malla]]. Books have been found from this era that describe their [[Tantra|tantric]] tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g.&nbsp;Haramekhala), religion (e.g.&nbsp;Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], [[Patan Durbar Square]], [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]], the former durbar of [[Kirtipur]], [[Nyatapola Temple|Nyatapola]], [[Kumbheshwar Temple|Kumbheshwar]], the Krishna temple, and others.

=== Medieval era ===
[[File:Old narayanhiti palace.jpg|thumb|The now demolished old royal palace in 1920]]

==== Early Shah rule ====

The [[Gorkha Kingdom]] ended the Malla confederation after the [[Battle of Kathmandu]] in 1768. This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu. The [[Battle of Kirtipur]] was the start of the [[Unification of Nepal|Gorkha conquest]] of the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] empire, and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal. During the early part of this era, Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture. Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture, such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur, were built during this era. However, trade declined because of continual war with neighbouring nations. [[Bhimsen Thapa]] supported France against Great Britain; this led to the development of modern military structures, such as modern barracks in Kathmandu. The nine-storey tower [[Dharahara]] was originally built during this era.

==== Rana rule ====

Rana rule over Nepal started with the [[Kot massacre]] of 1846, which occurred near Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. During this massacre, most of Nepal's high-ranking officials were massacred by [[Jung Bahadur Rana]] and his supporters. Another massacre, the [[List of massacres in Nepal|Bhandarkhal Massacre]], was also conducted by Kunwar and his supporters in Kathmandu. During the Rana regime, Kathmandu's alliance shifted from anti-British to pro-British; this led to the construction of the first buildings in the style of Western European architecture. The most well-known of these buildings include Singha Durbar, [[Garden of Dreams]], Shital Niwas, and the old Narayanhiti palace. The first modern commercial road in the Kathmandu Valley, the [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]], was also built during this era. [[Tri-Chandra College|Trichandra College]] (the first college of Nepal), [[Durbar High School]] (the first modern school of Nepal), and [[Bir Hospital]] (the first hospital of Nepal) were built in Kathmandu during this era. Education was only accessible to the privileged class. Rana rule was marked by despotism, economic exploitation and religious persecution.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dietrich |first=Angela |title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution |url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |access-date=24 September 2013 |newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods |year=1996 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001124156/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |archive-date=1 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lal |first=C.

== Geography ==
Kathmandu is in the northwestern part of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] to the north of the [[Bagmati River]] and covers an area of {{cvt|50.7|km2|1}}. The average elevation is {{convert|1400|m|ft|sigfig=2}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].<ref name="KTM intro">{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Introduction_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623003237/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Introduction_1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 June 2012 |title=Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office&nbsp;– Introduction |access-date=14 August 2014 |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office}}</ref> The city is bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley: south of the Bagmati by [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur Metropolitan City]] (Patan), with which it forms one urban area surrounded by a [[Ring Road (Kathmandu)|ring road]], to the southwest by [[Kirtipur]] and to the east by [[Madhyapur Thimi|Madyapur Thimi]]. To the north the urban area extends into several municipalities; [[Nagarjun Municipality|Nagarjun]], [[Tarakeshwar|Tarakeshwor]], [[Tokha]], [[Budhanilkantha]], [[Gokarneshwar|Gokarneshwor]] and [[Kageshwari-Manohara|Kageshwori Manohara]]. However, the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighbouring municipalities, e.g. to [[Bhaktapur]], and nearly covers the entire [[Kathmandu Valley]].

Kathmandu is dissected by eight rivers, the main river of the valley, the [[Bagmati River|Bagmati]] and its tributaries, of which the [[Bisnumati River|Bishnumati]], Dhobi Khola, Manohara Khola, Hanumante Khola, and Tukucha Khola are predominant. The mountains from where these rivers originate are in the elevation range of {{convert|1500|-|3000|m|ft}}, and have passes which provide access to and from Kathmandu and its valley.<ref name=facts>{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=2&pr_id=2 |title=Kathmandu Facts |access-date=12 December 2009 |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City Council, Government of Nepal |archive-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331101811/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=2&pr_id=2 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Geography>{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=3&pr_id=3 |title=Geography |access-date=12 December 2009 |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City |archive-date=4 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404081746/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=3&pr_id=3 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Shreshta S.H.">{{Cite book |last=Shreshta |title=Nepal in Maps |pages=102–14 |publisher=Educational Publishing House |location=Kathmandu |year=2005 |first=S.H}}</ref> An ancient canal once flowed from Nagarjuna hill through Balaju to Kathmandu; this canal is now extinct.

The city of Kathmandu and the surrounding valley are in the ''Deciduous Monsoon Forest Zone'' (altitude range of {{convert|1200|-|2100|m|ft}}), one of five vegetation zones defined for Nepal. The dominant tree species in this zone are [[oak]], [[elm]], [[beech]], [[maple]] and others, with [[coniferous]] trees at higher altitude.<ref>Shrestha S.H. p. 35</ref>

=== Kathmandu administration ===

Kathmandu and adjacent cities are composed of [[List of neighborhoods of Kathmandu|neighbourhoods]], which are utilized quite extensively and more familiar among locals. However, administratively the city is divided into 32 wards, numbered from 1 to 32. Earlier, there were 35 wards which made it the metropolitan city with the largest number of the wards.

Kathmandu Municipal Corporation (KMC) is the chief nodal agency for the administration of Kathmandu. The Municipality of Kathmandu was upgraded to a metropolitan city in 1995.

Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors: the Central Sector, the East Sector, the North Sector, the City Core and the West Sector. For civic administration, the city is further divided into 32 administrative wards. The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members. It holds biannual meetings to review, process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions.<ref name="facts" /><ref name="council">{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=9&pr_id=9 |title=Metropolis Council |access-date=14 December 2009 |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City Council, Government of Nepal |archive-date=4 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404082004/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=9&pr_id=9 |url-status=live}}</ref> The ward's profile documents for the 32 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population, the structure and condition of houses, the type of roads, educational, health and financial institutions, entertainment facilities, parking space, security provisions, etc. It also includes lists of development projects completed, on-going and planned, along with informative data about the cultural heritage, festivals, historical sites and the local inhabitants.

In 1966, a fire service was established in [[Tribhuvan International Airport|Kathmandu central airport]].<ref name="FAN" /> In 1975, a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu's fire service.<ref name="FAN" /> The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization, the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal (FAN), which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety.<ref name="FAN" />

=== Electricity and water supply ===
[[File:Public baths, Kathmandu. 1979.jpg|thumb|Public baths, Kathmandu. 1979]]
Electricity in Kathmandu is regulated and distributed by the [[Nepal Electricity Authority]] (NEA). Water supply and sanitation facilities are provided by the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL). There is a severe shortage of water for household purposes such as drinking, bathing, cooking and washing and irrigation. People have been using bottled mineral water, water from tank trucks and from the ancient [[dhunge dhara]]s ({{Langx|ne|ढुङ्गे धारा}}) for all the purposes related to water. The city water shortage should be solved by the completion of the much plagued [[Melamchi Water Supply Project]] by the end of 2019. Despite continued efforts by governmental bodies, Kathmandu is one of the most polluted cities in Nepal, largely due to overpopulation.<ref>[https://archive.nepalitimes.com/article/nation/Melamchi-water-not-enough-for-everyone,3899 Not enough for everyone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211110135454/https://archive.nepalitimes.com/article/nation/Melamchi-water-not-enough-for-everyone,3899 |date=10 November 2021 }} by Sonia Awale, Nepali Times, 25–31 August 2017.

{{Kathmandu valley World Heritage Site (WHS) Monuments}}

The ancient trade route between India and [[Tibet]] that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture.<ref name="festival">{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=142&pr_id=172 |title=Festivals |access-date=12 December 2009 |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal |archive-date=4 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404081644/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=142&pr_id=172 |url-status=live}}</ref> The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices. The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings. In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Nepal|World Heritage Site]] (WHS). The seven monuments zones cover an area of {{convert|189|ha|acre}}, with the buffer zone extending to {{convert|2394|ha|acre}}. The Seven Monument Zones inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are the [[Durbar square]]s of [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Hanuman Dhoka]], [[Patan Durbar Square|Patan]] and [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square|Bhaktapur]], the Hindu temples of [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Changu Narayan Temple|Changunarayan]], the Buddhist stupas of [[Swayambhunath]] and [[Boudhanath]].<ref name="Heritage">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/121 |title=Kathmandu Valley – Unesco World Heritage site |access-date=25 November 2009 |publisher=World Heritage – UNESCO.org |archive-date=31 October 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031092004/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/121 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="unesco">{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001520/152020m.pdf |title=Kathmandu Valley World Heritage site: Nepal |work=Heritage Homeowner's Preservation Manual |access-date=25 November 2009 |publisher=Unesco, Kathmandu and Bangkok |year=2006 |archive-date=4 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604225242/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001520/152020m.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Durbar Squares ===
{{Main|Kathmandu Durbar Square|Hanuman Dhoka}}

The literal meaning of [[Durbar Square]] is a "place of palaces". There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in [[Kirtipur]]. The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms (Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur); the earliest being the Licchavi dynasty. The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square. The outer quadrangle has the [[Kasthamandap]], [[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari Ghar]], and Shiva-Parvati Temple; the inner quadrangle has the [[Hanuman Dhoka]] palace. The squares were severely damaged in the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|April 2015 earthquake]].

Hanuman Dhoka is a complex of structures with the royal palace of the Malla kings and of the Shah dynasty. It is spread over five acres. The eastern wing (with ten courtyards) is the oldest part, dating to the mid-16th century. It was expanded by King Pratap Malla in the 17th century with many temples. The royal family lived in this palace until 1886 when they moved to Narayanhiti Palace. The stone inscription outside is in fifteen languages.

Kumari Ghar is a palace in the centre of the Kathmandu city, next to the Durbar square where a royal [[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]] selected from several Kumaris resides. Kumari (or Kumari Devi), is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy (or ''devi'') in South Asian countries. In Nepal, the selection process is very rigorous. Previously, during the time of the monarchy, the queen and the priests used to appoint the proposed Kumari with delicate process of astrological examination and physical examination of 32 'gunas'. The ''china'' ({{Langx|ne|चिना}}), an ancient Hindu astrological report of the Kumari and the reigning king, has been said to be similar. The Kumari is believed to be a bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju (the Nepali name for Durga) until she menstruates, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury also causes her to revert to common status. The current Kumari, Trishna Shakya, age three at the time of appointment, was installed in September 2017 succeeding Matina Shakya who was the first Kumari of Kathmandu after the end of the monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitnepal.com/nepal_information/kumari.php |title=Kumari Devi&nbsp;– The Living Goddess |publisher=Visitnepal.com |access-date=19 December 2009 |archive-date=7 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807200215/http://www.visitnepal.com/nepal_information/kumari.php |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Kasthamandap]] is a three-storeyed temple enshrining an image of [[Gorakhnath]]. It was built in the 16th century in the [[pagoda]] style. The name of Kathmandu is a derivative of the word ''Kasthamandap''. It was built under the reign of King Laxmi Narsingha Malla. Kasthamandap stands at the intersection of two ancient trade routes linking India and Tibet at [[Maru, Kathmandu|Maru]] square. It was originally built as a rest house for travellers.

[[File:Boudhanath stupa , Kathmandu, Nepal.jpg|thumb|226x226px|Boudhanath Stupa]]
Boudhanath ({{Langx|ne|बौद्ध स्तुप}}; also written as ''Bouddhanath'', ''Bodhnath'', ''Baudhanath'' or the ''Khāsa'' ''Chaitya''), is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal, along with the [[Swayambhunath]]. It is a very popular tourist site.

=== Rani Pokhari ===

{{Main|Ranipokhari}}

Ranipokhari ({{Langx|ne|रानी पोखरी|lit=Queen's Pond}}) is a historic artificial pond nestled in the heart of Kathmandu. It was built by king Pratap Malla in 1670 for his beloved queen after she lost her son and could not recover from her loss.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bossnepal.com/ranipokhari-the-queens-pond/ |title=Ranipokhari, the Queen's pond |website=bossnepal.com |access-date=14 March 2018 |archive-date=14 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314175128/http://bossnepal.com/ranipokhari-the-queens-pond/ |url-status=live}}</ref> A large stone statue of an elephant in the south signifies the image of Pratap Malla and his two sons.

=== Arts ===
[[File:Chaitya at Bakunani.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called ''[[Chaitya#Nepal|Chaityas]]'', seen in street corners and courtyards]]

Kathmandu valley the City of [[Newar people|Newars]] is described as "an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures", which are made of wood, stone, metal, and [[terracotta]], and found in profusion in temples, shrines, stupas, gompas, chaityas and palaces. The art objects are also seen in street corners, lanes, private courtyards, and in open ground. Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses. Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time, but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950.<ref name="Jha p.21">Jha p. 21</ref>

The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: Bhavani, Durga, Gaja-Lakshmi, Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses), and Sri-Lakshmi (wealth-goddess). From the 3rd century BCE, apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period (it is said that [[Ashoka]] visited Nepal in 250&nbsp;BC) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution: the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] or classical period (500 to 900&nbsp;AD), the post-classical period (1000 to 1400&nbsp;AD), with strong influence of the Palla art form; the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly [[tantra|tantric]] influences coupled with the art of [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] [[Demonology]].<ref name="Jha p.23">Jha p. 23</ref>
[[File:Shivalaya Pashupatinath Kathmandu Nepal Rajesh Dhungana (5).jpg|thumb|Shiva temples along Bagmati river of [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]]]]
A broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and carvings created by the people of Nepal. These artists have maintained a blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. The typology, based on the type of material used are: stone art, metal art, wood art, terracotta art, and painting.<ref>Jha pp. 23–24</ref>

==== Museums ====
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the [[National Museum of Nepal]] and the [[Natural History Museum of Nepal]]. Nepal's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. These are amply reflected in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries, and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artefacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day, including archaeological exportation.<ref name="asia">{{cite web |url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |title=Museums and Art Galleries of Nepal |publisher=Asiatravel.com |access-date=18 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819000914/http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |archive-date=19 August 2012}}</ref>

The National Museum is in the western part of Kathmandu, near the Swayambhunath stupa in a historical building constructed in the early 19th century by General [[Bhimsen Thapa]]. It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance. The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was ''Chhauni Silkhana'', meaning "the stone house of arms and ammunition". Given its focus, the museum contains many weapons, including locally made firearms used in wars, leather [[cannon]]s from the 18th–19th century, and medieval and modern works in wood, [[bronze]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and paintings.<ref name="Museums">{{cite web |url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |title=Museums and art galleries |publisher=Asia Travel |access-date=18 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819000914/http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |archive-date=19 August 2012}}</ref>

The enclosed compound of the Narayanhiti Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu. "Narayanhiti" ({{Langx|ne|नारायणहिटी}}) comes from ''Narayana'' ({{Langx|ne|नारायण}}), a form of the Hindu god [[Lord Vishnu|Vishnu]], and ''Hiti'' ({{Langx|ne|हिटी}}), meaning "water spout" (the temple of lord Vishnu is opposite to the palace, and the water spout is east of the main entrance to the precinct). The current palace building was built in 1970 in front of the old palace, built in 1915, in the form of a contemporary pagoda. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of the then crown prince and heir apparent to the throne, [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]]. The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and [[Durbar Marg]] roads.

Kathmandu is a centre for art in Nepal, displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists. Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as [[Paubha]]s in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as [[Thangka]]s in Tibet, closely linked to the country's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for.<ref name="Museums" /> Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kathmanduarts.org/ |title=Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre |publisher=Kathmanduarts.org |access-date=4 July 2010 |archive-date=27 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727200540/http://www.kathmanduarts.org/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library, in the [[Kaiser Mahal]] on the ground floor of the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Nepal)|Ministry of Education]] building. This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of [[Kaiser Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]. It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, and philosophy, as well as a Sanskrit manual of [[Tantra]], which is believed to be over 1,000 years old.<ref name="Museums" /> The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building, and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated.

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Nepali dal-bhat-tarkari.jpg|thumb|One of the typical Nepali meals Dal Bhat Tarkari in Kathmandu|alt=|left]]

The staple food of most people in Kathmandu is [[dal bhat]]. This consists of rice and lentil soup, generally served with vegetable curries, achar and sometimes chutney. [[Momo (food)|Momo]], a type of Nepali version of Tibetan dumpling, has become prominent in Nepal with many street vendors and restaurants selling it. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu. Various Nepali variants of momo including buff (i.e. buffalo) dumplings, chicken dumplings, and vegetarian momo are famous in Kathmandu.<!-- This article is about Kathmandu and most Nepali in Kathmandu have dal bhat as their day to day meal and are able to afford a simple meal of dal bhat and NOT any exotic and other cultural cuisines. Please see the talk regarding this discussion. The local cuisine of Kathmandu as of NOW is dal bhat and the cuisine as local is considered to be what the residents take not what a particular ethnic group takes.-->

Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian. However, the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon, and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city. Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places. ''Buff'' (meat of water buffalo) is very common. There is a strong tradition of ''buff'' consumption in Kathmandu, especially among [[Newar]]s, which is not found in other parts of Nepal. Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo. The Muslims forbid eating ''buff'' as from [[Quran]] while Hindus eat all varieties except beef as they consider [[Cattle|cow]] to be a goddess and symbol of purity. The chief lunch/snack for locals and visitors is mostly ''Momo'' or ''Chowmein''.

Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955.<ref name="LP 2003, p.91">Lonely Planet (2003), pp. 91–92</ref> A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened, catering [[Nepali cuisine]], [[Tibetan cuisine]], [[Chinese cuisine]] and [[Indian cuisine]] in particular. Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals, expatriates, and tourists. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American [[chop suey]], which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a [[fried egg]] commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine.<ref name="LP 2003, p.91" /> Continental cuisine can be found in selected places.

Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier. Traditionally, these festivals were celebrated by Newars. In recent years, these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well. As the capital of the Nepal, various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu. With mass migration to the city, the cultures of Khas from the west, [[Kirati people|Kirats]] from the east, Bon/Tibetan from the north, and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) Jatra, [[Indra Jatra]], Dashain [[Durga Puja]] festivals, [[Shivratri]] and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporates Hindu traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of the Buddhist religion.

==Religions==

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:Dipawali 2013 of Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Kathmandu valley as seen from Halchowk during [[Tihar (festival)|Deepawali]], 2013]][[Hinduism]] is one of the indigenous beliefs of the city. Assumedly, together with the kingdom of Licchhavi (c. 400 to 750), Hinduism and the [[endogamy|endogam]] [[social stratification]] of the [[Caste system in Nepal|caste]] was established in Kathmandu Valley. The [[Pashupatinath Temple]], [[Changu Narayan Temple]], and the [[Kasthamandap]] are of particular importance to Hindus. Other notable Hindu temples in Kathmandu and the surrounding valley include [[Bajrayogini Temple]], [[Dakshinkali Temple]], [[Guhyeshwari Temple]], and the [[Shobha Bhagawati]] shrine.

The [[Bagmati River]] which flows through Kathmandu is considered a [[holy river]] both by Hindus and Buddhists, and many Hindu temples are on the banks of this river. The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.
[[File:The Licchavi Princess Bhrikuti Devi in Golden Temple, Patan.jpg|thumb|7th century [[Bhrikuti|Princess Bhrikuti]] from Kathmandu is credited with spreading [[Buddhism]] in Tibet and China, and is worshipped as the Buddhist Goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Green Tara]]]]

=== Buddhism ===
Buddhism was brought into Kathmandu with the arrival of Buddhist monks during the time of Buddha (c. 563 – 483 BCE<ref name="Cousins">L. S. Cousins (1996), "[http://indology.info/papers/cousins The dating of the historical Buddha] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226184207/http://indology.info/papers/cousins/ |date=26 February 2011 }}: a review article", ''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'' '''(3)6(1)''': 57–63.</ref>). They established a forest monastery in [[Sankhu]]. This monastery was renovated by [[Shakya]]s after they fled genocide from [[Virudhaka]] (r. 491–461 BCE).

During the Hindu Lichchavi era (c. 400 to 750), various monasteries and orders were created which successively led to the formation of [[Newar Buddhism]], which is still practiced in the primary [[liturgical language]] of Hinduism, [[Sanskrit]].

Legendary Princess [[Bhrikuti]] (7th-century) and artist [[Araniko]] (1245–1306 CE) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China. There are over 108 traditional monasteries (Bahals and Baháʼís) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism. Since the 1960s, the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area. Also, with the modernization of Newar Buddhism, various Theravada Bihars have been established.

=== Kirat Mundhum ===
Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous [[animism|animistic]] practices of Nepal. It is practiced by the [[Kirati people|Kirat people]]. Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs, such as ancestor worship (worship of Ajima) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin. Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats, such as Pashupatinath, Wanga Akash Bhairabh (Yalambar) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu. Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice [[Mundhum]] in the city.<ref name="Broadening">{{Cite web |work=Kathmandu post |publisher=Ekantipur |date=2 February 2017 |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-02-02/broadening-the-nepali-mind.html |title=Broadening the Nepali mind |access-date=21 July 2017 |archive-date=3 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803012308/http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-02-02/broadening-the-nepali-mind.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Rastrabank.JPG|thumb|[[Nepal Rastra Bank|Central Bank of Nepal]]|alt=|left]]

The location and terrain of Kathmandu have played a significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia. The city is in an ancient lake basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and China, helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading centre over the centuries. Kathmandu's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the [[Silk Road]] which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, [[Lhasa Newar]] merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Todd T |title=Buddhism, Himalayan Trade, and Newar Merchants |url=http://buddhim.20m.com/8-4.htm/ |access-date=28 July 2012 |archive-date=7 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061349/http://buddhim.20m.com/8-4.htm/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Other traditional occupations are farming, metal casting, woodcarving, painting, weaving, and pottery.<ref name="economy">{{cite web |title=Economy |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=5&pr_id=5 |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal |access-date=20 December 2009 |archive-date=29 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729234251/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=5&pr_id=5 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Shanker.jpg|thumb|[[Hotel Shanker]] is one of the city's popular heritage hotels]]

[[Tourism in Nepal]] is considered an important industry. In 1956, air transportation was established and the construction of [[Tribhuvan Highway]], between Kathmandu and [[Raxaul]], was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote the tourism industry, including the [[Nepal Tourism Board|Tourism Development Board]], the Department of Tourism, and the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal|Civil Aviation Department]]. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity. The hotel industry, travel agencies, the training of tourist guides, and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the significant growth of this industry in Nepal and in Kathmandu in particular.<ref name="Shrestha p.86-89">Shrestha pp. 86–89</ref>

Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu's religious sites such as [[Pashupatinath Temple]], [[Swayambhunath]], [[Boudhanath]], [[Changu Narayan Temple]], and [[Budhanilkantha Temple]]. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62, the number increased to 491,504 in 1999/2000. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8 percent of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining. Following the end of [[Nepalese Civil War]], there was a significant rise in the number of tourist arrivals, with 509,956 tourists recorded in 2009. Since then, tourism has improved as the country transitioned into a republic. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the cultural heritage of the country which is continously preserved and restored at great cost.<ref name="Shrestha p.86-89" />
