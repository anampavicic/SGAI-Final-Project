'''Liguria''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|ˈ|g|j|ʊəɹ|i|ə}}; {{IPA|it|liˈɡuːrja|lang}}; {{langx|lij|Ligûria}}, {{IPA-lij|liˈɡyːɾja|lang}}) is a [[Regions of Italy|region]] of north-western [[Italy]]; its [[Capital city|capital]] is [[Genoa]]. Its territory is crossed by the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] [[Mountain chain|mountain range]] and is roughly coextensive with the former territory of the [[Republic of Genoa]]. Liguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It rests on the [[Ligurian Sea]], and has a population of 1,557,533. The region is part of the [[Alps–Mediterranean Euroregion]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Liguria'' predates [[Latin]] and is of obscure origin. The Latin [[adjectives]] {{lang|la|Ligusticum}} (as in {{lang|la|Mare Ligusticum}}) and ''Liguscus''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dicolatin.com/|title=DicoLatin|website=DicoLatin}}</ref> reveal the original root of the name, ''ligusc-'': in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of {{lang|la|Liguria}}, according to [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]. Compare {{langx|grc|λίγυς|translit=Lígus|translation=a Ligurian, a person from Liguria}} whence {{lang|grc-Latn|Ligustikḗ}} {{lang|grc|λιγυστική}} {{translation|the name of the place Liguria}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ligus&la=greek#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> The name derives from the ancient [[Ligures]] people, although the territory of this people was much larger than the current administrative region; it included all of North-west Italy south to the [[Po (river)|Po river]], and south-eastern [[France]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Some scholars see a possible connection with [[Old European languages]], as the formant -sc- (-sk-) is also present in names like [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Euskadi]] (the [[endonym]] of the Basques), and [[Gascony|Gascon]]. Since these are all coastal regions, the shared formant may relate to a shared descent from pre-Indo-European, maritime peoples,<ref>Room, "Placenames of the World," 2006</ref><ref>Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Premiers Habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition 1889-1894)</ref> and/or the hypothetical [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]] and [[Vasconic]] language families respectively. This argument is weakened, however, by the fact that the name Etruscan is a relatively late [[exonym]] and the relevant endonym, used of the Etruscans themselves, was ''Rasenna'' or ''Raśna''. (In Greek this mutated into  ''Tursēnoi''  and ''Tyrrēnoi''; in Latin it became ''Etruria'' and ''Tuscia'', whence the name of the modern [[Tuscany]] or ''Toscana''.){{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

==Geography==
[[File:Cinque Terre Vernazza 2.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[Cinque Terre]]]]
The narrow strip of land is bordered by the [[Ligurian Sea|sea]], the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains]]. Some mountains rise above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}; the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] line runs at an average altitude of about {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. The highest point of the region is the summit of [[Monte Saccarello]] ({{convert|2201|m|abbr=on|disp=semicolon}}).

Liguria is the third smallest Italian region after [[Aosta Valley]] and [[Molise]], but is also one of the most densely populated, with a [[population density]] of 287 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>, much higher than the national average, and is fourth place after [[Campania]], [[Lombardy]] and [[Lazio]]. However, there is much difference between inland mountain areas and coastal areas.

The region is crossed east to west by the [[Ligurian Alps]] and the [[Ligurian Apennine]]s that form an interrupted chain, but discontinuous in its morphology, with stretches where the Alpine/Apennine ridge is extremely compact and high aligning very high mountain groups (north to Ventimiglia, a series of massifs which became French after the Second World War, rises up to altitudes of 2700–3000 m) while in other stretches (for example in the hinterland of Savona and Genoa) the mountain barrier is not very high and deeply crossed by short valleys and passes that do not reach 500 m above sea level ([[Colle di Cadibona|Bochetta di Altare]], Passo dei Giovi, Crocetta d'Orero).

The winding arched extension goes from [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] to [[La Spezia]]. Of this, {{convert|3524.08|km2|2|abbr=on}} are mountainous (65% of the total) and {{convert|891.95|km2|2|abbr=on}} are hills (35% of the total). Liguria's natural reserves cover 12% of the entire region, or {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.

The continental shelf is very narrow and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its {{convert|350|km|adj=on}} coastline. Except for the [[Portovenere]] and [[Portofino]] promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]].

The hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are {{convert|7|to|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and summer temperatures are {{convert|23|to|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an [[orographic]] effect. Genoa and [[La Spezia]] can see up to {{convert|2000|mm|-1|abbr=on}} of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of {{convert|500|to|800|mm|-1|abbr=on}} annually.

As of 2023, according to the report on land consumption of the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, [[Marche]] and Liguria hold the Italian record for coastal overbuilding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liguria, the future razed to the ground|date=5 December 2023 |url=https://www.vanityfair.it/article/consumo-di-suolo-liguria}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref><ref>{{cite web |title=I dati sul consumo di suolo |url=https://www.isprambiente.gov.it/it/attivita/suolo-e-territorio/suolo/il-consumo-di-suolo/i-dati-sul-consumo-di-suolo |website=ISPRA Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale |language=it}}</ref>

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Resti del principe delle arene candide.jpg|thumb|Burial of an adolescent from the Upper Palaeolithic (29,000 years), having led archaeologists to nickname him the "[[Arene Candide|young prince]]". About fifteen years old, he lay on his back on a layer of red ocher seven meters from the surface facing south, he wore a headgear decorated with shell beads and pierced deer teeth and squirrel tails on the thorax (Liguria region).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mudifinale.com/en/il-giovane-principe/ | title=The Young Prince of the Arene Candide }}</ref>]]
Evidence of human presence in Liguria dates back to prehistoric times. Near the port of Nice, in Terra Amata, traces of the oldest huts built by nomadic hunters, around [[Pleistocene|300,000]] years ago, have been found. The stratigraphy showed different settlement periods, with the remains of oval huts with a central hearth, chipped pebbles, scrapers and captured animals such as wild boar, turtles, Merk's rhinoceros, southern elephants, aurochs and various birds. Traces of Neanderthal Man have been found near Loano. In the caves of Toirano, signs of frequentation dating back to the end of the Upper Palaeolithic are visible. Remains reminiscent of Cro-Magnon Man have appeared in the Balzi Rossi cave in Ventimiglia. At the Arene Candide there is evidence of Neolithic and epigravettian strata dating between 20,000 and 18,700 years ago, while in the caves along the Pennavaira stream, in the valley of the same name in the Ingauno area, human remains have been found dating back as far as 7,000 BC.

Copper begins to be mined from the middle of the [[4th millennium BC]] in Liguria with the Libiola and Monte Loreto mines dated to [[37th century BC|3700 BC]].
These are the oldest copper mines in the western Mediterranean basin.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Monte-Loreto-Fourth-millennium-cal-BC-mineshaft-ML6_fig1_265409510 Figure 3. Monte Loreto. Fourth-millennium cal BC mineshaft (ML6)]</ref>

From the 2nd millennium B.C. ([[Neolithic]]), there are records of the presence of Ligurians over a vast territory, corresponding to most of northern Italy.

It is commonly thought that the ancient Ligurians settled on the Mediterranean coastline, divided in several tribes, from the [[Rhône|Rhone]] to the [[Arno]] (so we are told by [[Polybius]]), pushing their presence as far as the Spanish Mediterranean coast to the west and the Tiber to the south-east, colonizing the coasts of major islands such as [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]]. Numerous ceramic artefacts remain of them.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zamboni |first=Lorenzo |year=2022 |title=Ceramiche d'impasto decorate in Cisalpina tra seconda età del Ferro e romanizzazione - appunti per una ricerca (PDF) |url=https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/lanx/article/download/17090/15056 |website=Milano University Press}}</ref>

=== The foundation of Genoa ===
{{Main|History of Genoa}}
The Genoa area has been inhabited since the fifth or fourth millennium BC.<ref>The objects found during the works for the underground had been exposed in the exhibition ''Archeologia Metropolitana. Piazza Brignole e Acquasola'', held at the Ligurian Archeology Museum (30 November 2009 - 14 February 2010) ([http://www.museidigenova.it/spip.php?article479] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235040/http://www.museidigenova.it/spip.php?article479|date=December 30, 2013|data=30 dicembre 2013}})</ref> In ancient times this area was inhabited by [[Ligures]] (ancient people after whom Liguria is named). According to excavations carried out in the city between 1898 and 1910, the Ligure population that lived in Genoa maintained trade relations with the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and the [[Greeks]], since several objects from these populations were found.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Melli|first=Piera|title=Genova preromana.

The ancient Ligurian city was known as Stalia (Σταλìα), referred to in this way by [[Artemidorus Ephesius]] and [[Pomponius Mela]]; this toponym is possibly preserved in the name of Staglieno, some {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} from the coast. Stalia had an alliance with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] through a ''foedus aequum'' (equal pact) in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] (218-201&nbsp;BC). The [[Carthaginians]] accordingly destroyed it in 209&nbsp;BC. The town was rebuilt and, after the [[Carthaginian Wars]] ended in 146&nbsp;BC, it received municipal rights. The original ''castrum'' then expanded towards the current areas of Santa Maria di Castello and the San Lorenzo promontory. Trade goods included skins, timber, and honey. Goods were moved to and from Genoa's hinterland, including major cities like [[Tortona]] and [[Piacenza]]. An amphitheater was also found there among other archaeological remains from the Roman period.

=== Roman times ===

[[File:Luna Amphitheater1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Roman amphitheatre of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] (1st century AD)]]

During the first [[Punic War]], the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with [[Carthage]], others, including the inhabitants of Stalia (later [[Genoa]]), with Rome. Under [[Augustus]], Liguria was designated a [[Augustan regions of Italy|region of Italy]] (''Regio IX Liguria'') stretching from the coast to the banks of the [[Po River]]. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of [[Albenga]], Ventimiglia and [[Luni, Italy|Luni]]. In 180 B.C., the Romans, in order to dispose of Ligurian rebels in their seeking of the [[Gallic Wars|conquest of Gaul]], they deported 47,000 Liguri [[Apuani]], confining them to the Samnite area between [[Avellino]] and [[Benevento]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Strabismo di Venere - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Simonetta Vespucci]], a native Ligurian who was a famous beauty during the Renaissance, may have been the model for [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'']]

Between the 4th and the 10th centuries, Liguria was dominated by the [[Byzantine]]s, the [[Lombards]] of King [[Rothari]] (about 641) and the [[Franks]] (about 774). It was also invaded by [[Saracen]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries, the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops' power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which [[Genoa]] soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.{{fix|text=vague}}

[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|thumbnail|250px|Territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (shown in purple)]]

Between the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the [[Mediterranean]] from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the [[Battle of Meloria (1284)]], it acquired control over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, [[Genoese colonies|having colonies]] up to [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimean]].

After the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of [[Simone Boccanegra]], Genoa resumed its struggles against the [[Marquisate of Finale]] and the Counts of [[Laigueglia]] and it conquered again the territories of [[Finale Ligure|Finale]], [[Oneglia]] and [[Porto Maurizio]]. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti family]] of [[Milan]]. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge [[Antoniotto I Adorno|Antoniotto Adorno]] to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.

===Early modern===

[[File:Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio - Ritratto di Cristoforo Colombo (1520).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]], by [[Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio]]]]

The alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when [[Andrea Doria]] allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic relative stability for about 250 years.

[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Reparation faite à Louis XIV par le Doge de Gênes.15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]]]]

Genoese explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s speculative proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].

The value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the [[Age of Discovery]], when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombardment]] by [[Louis XIV]]'s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Piedmontese]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] armies when these two states came into conflict with France. Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the [[Habsburg]] troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the [[Ligurian Republic]], modelled on the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1805) and divided by [[Napoleon]] into three departments: [[Montenotte (department)]], with capital [[Savona]], [[Gênes]], with capital [[Genoa]] and the department of the [[Apennines]], with the capital [[Chiavari]].

[[File:Giuseppe Mazzini (small).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was a patriot, philosopher and politician of the 19th century.]]

===Late modern and contemporary===

After a short period of independence in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' were born in Liguria ([[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Goffredo Mameli|Mameli]], [[Nino Bixio]]). Italian patriot and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who was born in the neighbouring [[Nice]] (then part of the [[Savoyard state|Sardinian state]]), started his [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.

In late 19th and early 20th century, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from [[Imperia]] to [[La Spezia]], while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the [[Second World War]], Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the [[Nazi|German]] troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led—among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat, the city was awarded the gold medal for military valour.

The population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, or 770 per mi<sup>2</sup>), being only less than [[Campania]]'s, [[Lombardy]]'s and [[Lazio]]'s. In the [[Metropolitan City of Genoa]], it reaches almost 500 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, whereas in the provinces of [[province of imperia|Imperia]] and [[province of savona|Savona]] it is less than 200 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>. The Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]], noting it from sea in 1436, remarked "To one who does not know it, the whole coast from Savona to Genoa looks like one continuous city, so well inhabited is it, and so thickly studded with houses,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch1|title=Pero Tafur|website=depts.washington.edu}}</ref> and today over 80% of the regional population still lives permanently near to the coast, where all the four major cities above 50,000 are located: [[Genoa]] (pop. 610,000), [[La Spezia]] (pop. 95,000), [[Savona]] (pop. 62,000) and [[Sanremo]] (pop. 56,000).

The population of Liguria has been declining since the census in 1971, most markedly in the cities of Genoa, Savona and La Spezia. The age pyramid now looks more like a 'mushroom' resting on a fragile base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_pop.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132604/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_pop.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> The negative trend has been partially interrupted only in the last decade when, after a successful economic recovery, the region has attracted consistent fluxes of immigrants. {{As of|2008}}, the Italian national institute of statistics, ISTAT, estimated that 90,881 foreign-born immigrants live in Liguria, equal to 5.7% of the total regional population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/strasa2008/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |access-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>

==Economy==

[[File:Aerial view - Harbour of Genoa, Italy - DSC01156.JPG|thumb|left|The [[port of Genoa]] is the busiest in Italy.]]

Ligurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, [[Italian wine|wine]], [[olive oil]]) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999).<ref name="regportraits1">{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916185647/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_eco.htm |archive-date=16 September 2008 }}</ref> The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).

Steel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting production. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding, electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the region still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).<ref name="regportraits1"/>
In the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.

=== Transport ===
A good motorways network ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).
In average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region.<ref name="regportraits1"/> The [[Port of Genoa]], with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes<ref name="genova1">{{cite web|url=http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |title=Autorità Portuale di Genova&nbsp;— Traffico porto |publisher=Porto.genova.it |access-date=26 December 2008 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145356/http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |archive-date= 2 December 2008 }}</ref> is the first port of Italy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20070406_00/inf_07_05_statistiche_trasporti_marittimi_2002_2004.pdf|title=Inf_07_05_Statistiche dei trasporti marittimi 2002–2004|access-date=26 December 2008|archive-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419165834/http://www3.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20070406_00/inf_07_05_statistiche_trasporti_marittimi_2002_2004.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> the second in terms of [[twenty-foot equivalent units]] after the port of [[transshipment]] of [[Gioia Tauro]], with a trade volume of 1.86 million TEUs.<ref name="genova1"/> The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona and Canary Islands.

=== Economical statistics ===
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was '''49.9''' billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.8% of Italy's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was '''32,000''' euros or 106% of the EU27 average in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Liguria}}
[[File:Via Olivo, 101, 19025 Portovenere SP, Italy - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Portovenere]]]]
The politics of Liguria takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the President of Regional Government is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Regional Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.

The Regional Government is presided by the Governor, who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed of the President and the Ministers, who are currently 11, including a vice president.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regione.liguria.it/MenuSezione.asp?Parametri=1_2_2_$1_2_2_$Giunta$0$ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021209233825/http://www.regione.liguria.it/MenuSezione.asp?Parametri=1_2_2_$1_2_2_$Giunta$0$ |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 December 2002 |title=Regione Liguria – - sito ufficiale |publisher=Regione.liguria.it |access-date=5 May 2009 }}</ref>

The Regional Council of is composed of 40 members and it is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the ''simul stabunt vel simul cadent'' clause (introduced in 1999), also the council will be dissolved and there will be a fresh election.

In the last regional election, which took place on 31 May 2015, [[Giovanni Toti]] ([[Forza Italia]]) defeated Raffaella Paita ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]), after 10 years of regional left-wing government by [[Claudio Burlando]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]).

At both national and local level, Liguria is considered a swing region, where no one of the two political blocs is dominant, with the two eastern provinces leaning left, and the two western provinces right.

Liguria is one of 20 regions (administrative divisions) of Italy.

==Administrative divisions==
Liguria is divided into four provinces:

===Cuisine===
[[File:Pesto5.jpg|thumb|upright|Pasta with [[pesto sauce|pesto]] is a traditional Ligurian recipe.]]
{{Main|Cuisine of Liguria}}
Liguria is the original source of [[pesto]], one of the most popular sauces in Italian cuisine, made with fresh [[basil (herb)|basil]], [[pine kernel]]s, [[olive oil]], [[garlic]] and [[Parmesan cheese]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mangiareinliguria.it/consorziopestogenovese/pestogenovese.php |title=La Ricetta del Pesto Genovese |language=it |author=Della Gatta, Andrea |publisher=Consorzio del Pesto Genovese |access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref>

[[Seafood]] is a major staple of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], the Ligurian variety being no exception, as the sea has been part of the region's culture since its beginning. ''Ciuppin'' soup is made from fish leftovers and stale bread, flavoured with white wine, onion, and garlic.<ref name=MadeInItaly>{{cite web |url=http://www.made-in-italy.com/italian-food/regions/liguria |title=The Food and Cuisine of Liguria|publisher=Made in Italy |access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref>

Vegetables, especially beans, are important in Ligurian cooking. ''Mesciua'' soup is made from beans, olive oil and [[farro]] (old kinds of wheat including [[emmer]]).<ref name=MadeInItaly/> The Badalucco, conio and pigna beans are a [[Slow Food]] Presidium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/slow-food-presidia/badalucco-conio-and-pigna-beans/|title=Badalucco, Conio, and Pigna Beans - Presìdi Slow Food|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref>

Ligurian pasta includes ''[[trenette]]'' and ''[[trofie]]'', and the fresh pasta pockets called ''pansòuti''.<ref name=MadeInItaly/>

===Sports===
The two main men's football clubs are [[Genoa C.F.C.]] and [[U.C. Sampdoria]], which have played for decades in [[Serie A]]. They share the [[Stadio Luigi Ferraris]], and face each other in the [[Derby della Lanterna]]. The third most successful club is [[Spezia Calcio]], which debuted in Serie A in 2020.

[[Pro Recco]] is a men's water polo club that has a record 33 [[Serie A1 (water polo)|Serie A1]] titles and 9 [[LEN Champions League]] titles.

The [[Milan–San Remo]] is one of the most prestigious one-day road cycling races in the world.

The [[Rallye Sanremo]] auto race was part of the [[World Rally Championship]] from 1973 to 2003.

The [[Piatti Tennis Center]], located in [[Bordighera]], was the original training base of tennis player [[Jannik Sinner]].
