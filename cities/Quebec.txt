Between 1534 and 1763, what is now Quebec was the [[List of French possessions and colonies|French colony]] of ''[[Canada (New France)|Canada]]'' and was the most developed colony in [[New France]]. Following the [[Seven Years' War]], ''Canada'' became a [[Territorial evolution of the British Empire#List of territories that were once a part of the British Empire|British colony]], first as the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] (1763–1791), then [[Lower Canada]] (1791–1841), and lastly part of the [[Province of Canada]] (1841–1867) as a result of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]]. It was [[Canadian Confederation|confederated]] with Ontario, [[Nova Scotia]], and New Brunswick in 1867. [[Grande Noirceur|Until the early 1960s]], the [[Catholic Church in Canada|Catholic Church]] played a large role in the social and cultural institutions in Quebec. However, the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s to 1980s increased the role of the Government of Quebec in [[État québécois|''l'État québécois'']] (the public authority of Quebec).

The [[Government of Quebec]] functions within the context of a [[Westminster system]] and is both a [[liberal democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Premier of Quebec]] acts as [[head of government]]. [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Independence debates]] have played a large role in [[Quebec politics]]. Quebec society's [[Social order|cohesion]] and [[Distinct society|specificity]] is based on three of its unique [[Statutory law|statutory]] documents: the ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'', the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'', and the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''. Furthermore, unlike elsewhere in Canada, [[Quebec law|law in Quebec]] is mixed: [[private law]] is exercised under a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] system, while [[public law]] is exercised under a [[Common law|common-law]] system.

Quebec's [[List of countries and territories where French is an official language|official language]] is French; [[Quebec French|Québécois French]] is the regional [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]. Quebec is the only [[Francophone Canadians|Francophone]]-majority province. The [[economy of Quebec]] is mainly supported by its large service sector and varied industrial sector. For exports, it leans on the key industries of [[aeronautics]], where it is the 6th largest worldwide seller,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Canada |first=Global Affairs |date=2015-10-20 |title=Sector Snapshots - Canadian Trade Commissioner Service - Quebec |url=https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/quebec/snapshot-apercus.aspx?lang=eng |access-date=2024-01-21 |website=GAC}}</ref> [[Hydro-Québec|hydroelectricity]], mining, [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceuticals]], aluminum, wood, and paper. Quebec is well known for producing [[maple syrup]], for [[Comedy in Quebec|its comedy]], and for making [[Ice hockey|hockey]] one of the most [[Ice hockey in Canada|popular sports in Canada]]. It is also renowned for its [[Culture of Quebec|culture]]; the province produces [[Quebec literature|literature]], [[Music of Quebec|music]], [[Cinema of Quebec|films]], [[List of French-language Canadian television series|TV shows]], [[List of festivals in Quebec|festivals]], and more.

In the 15th century, the [[Fall of Constantinople|Byzantine Empire fell]], prompting Western Europeans to search for new [[sea lane|sea routes]] to the [[Far East]].{{sfn|Charpentier|Durocher|Laville|Linteau|1985|p=47}} Around 1522–23, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] persuaded [[King Francis I of France]] to commission an expedition to find a western route to [[Cathay]] (China) via a [[Northwest Passage]]. Though this expedition was unsuccessful, it established the name ''New France'' for northeast North America.{{sfn|Charpentier|Durocher|Laville|Linteau|1985|p=50}} In his first expedition ordered from the Kingdom of France, [[Jacques Cartier]] became the first European explorer to discover and map Quebec when he landed in [[Gaspé, Quebec|Gaspé]] on July 24, 1534.{{sfn |Riendeau|2007| p=36}} In the second expedition, in 1535, Cartier explored the lands of [[Stadacona]] and named the village and its surrounding territories ''[[Canada (New France)|Canada]]'' (from {{lang|iro|kanata}}, 'village' in [[Iroquoian language|Iroquois]]). Cartier returned to France with about 10 [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], including Chief [[Donnacona]]. In 1540, Donnacona told the legend of the [[Kingdom of Saguenay]] to the King, inspiring him to order a third expedition, this time led by [[Jean-François de La Rocque de Roberval]]; it was unsuccessful in its goal of finding the kingdom.{{sfn|Charpentier|Durocher|Laville|Linteau|1985|p=51}}

[[File:Province_of_Quebec_1774.gif|thumb|The [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] in 1774]]
After the British acquired Canada in 1763, the British government established a constitution for the newly acquired territory, under the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Royal Proclamation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/patrimoine/lexique/proclamation-royale-(1763).html#:~:text=Le%2010%20f%C3%A9vrier%201763%2C%20en,France%20et%20par%20l'Espagne.|publisher=Government of Quebec|title=Proclamation royale (1763)|accessdate=July 5, 2021}}</ref> The Canadiens were subordinated to the government of the [[First British Empire|British Empire]] and circumscribed to a region of the [[St. Lawrence River|St. Lawrence Valley]] and [[Anticosti Island]] called the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]]. With unrest growing in their southern colonies, the British were worried that the Canadiens might support what would become the [[American Revolution]]. To secure allegiance to the British crown, Governor [[James Murray (Quebec governor)|James Murray]] and later Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] promoted the need for accommodations, resulting in the enactment of the [[Quebec Act]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Quebec Act, 1774|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|last=Dagenais|first=Maxime|date=May 11, 2020|url=https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-act}}</ref> of 1774. This act allowed Canadiens to regain their [[Law in Quebec|civil customs]], return to the seigneural system, regain certain rights including use of French, and reappropriate their old territories: Labrador, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, [[Illinois Country]] and the [[Indian Territory]].<ref name="Geographers19682">{{cite book|author=Canadian Association of Geographers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA33|title=Canada: a Geographical Interpretation|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1968|isbn=9780458906000|page=33}}</ref>

As early as 1774, the [[Continental Congress]] of the separatist [[Thirteen Colonies]] attempted to rally the Canadiens to its cause. However, [[Continental Army|its military troops]] failed to defeat the British counteroffensive during its [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|Invasion of Quebec]] in 1775. Most Canadiens remained neutral, though some regiments allied themselves with the Americans in the [[Saratoga campaign]] of 1777. When the British recognized the independence of the rebel colonies at the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783, it conceded Illinois and the Ohio Valley to the newly formed United States and denoted the 45th parallel as its border, drastically reducing Quebec's size.

Some [[United Empire Loyalists]] from the US migrated to Quebec and populated various regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://histoire-du-quebec.ca/loyalistes/|title=Loyalistes au Bas-Canada|publisher=Histoire du Quebec|accessdate=July 5, 2021}}</ref> Dissatisfied with the legal rights under the French seigneurial régime which applied in Quebec, and wanting to use the British legal system to which they were accustomed, the Loyalists protested to British authorities until the [[Constitutional Act 1791|Constitutional Act]] of 1791 was enacted, dividing the Province of Quebec into two distinct colonies starting from the [[Ottawa River]]: [[Upper Canada]] to the west (predominantly Anglo-Protestant) and [[Lower Canada]] to the east (Franco-Catholic). Lower Canada's lands consisted of the coasts of the Saint Lawrence River, Labrador and Anticosti Island, with the territory extending north to [[Rupert's Land]], and south, east and west to the borders with the US, New Brunswick, and Upper Canada. The creation of Upper and Lower Canada allowed Loyalists to live under British laws and institutions, while Canadiens could maintain their French civil law and Catholic religion. Governor Haldimand drew Loyalists away from Quebec City and Montreal by offering free land on the north shore of Lake Ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to George III. During the [[War of 1812]], [[Charles de Salaberry|Charles-Michel de Salaberry]] became a hero by leading the Canadian troops to victory at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay]]. This loss caused the Americans to abandon the Saint Lawrence Campaign, their major strategic effort to conquer Canada.

[[File:Saint-Eustache-Patriotes.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Saint-Eustache]] was the final battle of the Lower Canada Rebellion.<ref name=rebellion/>]]
Gradually, the [[Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada]], who represented the people, came into conflict with the superior authority of [[the Crown]] and [[Legislative Council of Lower Canada|its appointed representatives]]. Starting in 1791, the government of Lower Canada was criticized and contested by the [[Parti canadien]]. In 1834, the Parti canadien presented its [[Ninety-Two Resolutions|92 resolutions]], political demands which expressed loss of confidence in the [[British monarchy]]. Discontentment intensified throughout the [[List of the public meetings held in Lower Canada between May and November 1837|public meetings]] of 1837, and the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] began in 1837.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/patriotes|title=Patriotes|website=L'Encyclopédie Canadienne|last=Roy|first=Fernande|date=March 4, 2015}}</ref> In 1837, [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]] led residents of Lower Canada to form an armed group called the [[Patriotes]].

The Patriotes were victorious in their first battle, the [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|Battle of Saint-Denis]]. However, they were unorganized and badly equipped, leading to their loss against the British army in the [[Battle of Saint-Charles]], and defeat in the [[Battle of Saint-Eustache]].<ref name=rebellion>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/rebellion-du-bas-canada|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|title=Rébellion du Bas-Canada (La guerre des patriotes)|last=Buckner|first=Phillip|date=July 23, 2020}}</ref>

In response to the rebellions, [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was asked to undertake a study and prepare a [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|report]] offering a solution to the British Parliament.<ref name="durham2">{{cite web|last=Ouellet |first=Fernand|title=Lambton, John George, 1st Earl of Durham|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=37606&PHPSESSID=qj23a0tmehl1lulfrlfrhk0c53|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805103634/http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=37606&PHPSESSID=qj23a0tmehl1lulfrlfrhk0c53|archivedate=August 5, 2011|accessdate=July 12, 2011|work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online}}</ref> Durham recommended that Canadiens be [[Cultural assimilation|culturally assimilated]], with English as their only official language. To do this, the British passed the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'', which merged Upper Canada and Lower Canada into a single colony: the [[Province of Canada]]. Lower Canada became the francophone and densely populated [[Canada East]], and Upper Canada became the anglophone and sparsely populated [[Canada West]]. This union, unsurprisingly, was the main source of political instability until 1867. Despite their population gap, Canada East and Canada West obtained an identical number of seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]], which created representation problems. In the beginning, Canada East was underrepresented because of its superior population size. Over time, however, massive immigration from the British Isles to Canada West occurred. Since the two regions continued to have equal representation, this meant it was now Canada West that was under-represented. The representation issues were called into question by debates on [[Representation (politics)|"Representation by Population"]]. The British population began to use the term "[[English Canadians|Canadian]]", referring to Canada, their place of residence. The French population, who had thus far identified as "Canadiens", began to be identified with their [[ethnic community]] under the name "[[French Canadian]]" as they were a "French of Canada".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/ijcs/2008-n37-ijcs3714/040800ar.pdf |title=The Only Canadians: Canada's French and the British Connection |language=fr |access-date=22 August 2023}}</ref>

As access to new lands remained problematic because they were still monopolized by the [[Château Clique|Clique du Château]], an exodus of Canadiens towards [[New England]] began and went on for the next hundred years. This phenomenon is known as the [[Grande Hémorragie]] and threatened the survival of the Canadien nation. The massive British immigration ordered from London that followed the failed rebellion, compounded this. To combat it, the Church adopted the [[La Revanche des berceaux|revenge of the cradle]] policy. In 1844, the capital of the Province of Canada was moved from [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] to Montreal.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Musée Pointe-à-Callière |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCWs7opCrUI  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/uCWs7opCrUI |archive-date=December 13, 2021 |url-status=live|title=Montréal, une capitale, un parlement (1844-1849) |language=fr |via=YouTube |accessdate=September 12, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Canadian province (1867–present)===
[[File:George-Etienne Cartier.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George-Étienne Cartier]], co-premier from [[Canada East]] and a Father of Confederation]]
In 1864, negotiations began for [[Canadian Confederation]] between the Province of Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia at the [[Charlottetown Conference]] and [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]].

After having fought as a Patriote, [[George-Étienne Cartier]] entered politics in the Province of Canada, becoming one of the co-premiers and advocate for the union of the British North American provinces. He became a leading figure at the Quebec Conference, which produced the [[Quebec Resolutions]], the foundation for Canadian Confederation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bibliothèque et Archives Canada |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-7104-f.html|title= Résolutions de la Conférence de Québec - octobre 1864|accessdate=September 12, 2021}}</ref> Recognized as a [[Father of Confederation]], he successfully argued for the establishment of the province of Quebec, initially composed of the historic heart of the territory of the French Canadian nation and where French Canadians would most likely retain majority status.

Following the [[London Conference of 1866]], the Quebec Resolutions were implemented as the ''[[British North America Act, 1867]]'' and brought into force on July 1, 1867, creating Canada. Canada was composed of four founding provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Ontario]] and Quebec. These last two came from splitting the Province of Canada, and used the old borders of Lower Canada for Quebec, and Upper Canada for Ontario. On July 15, 1867, [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]] became Quebec's [[List of premiers of Quebec|first premier]].

From Confederation until World War I, the Catholic Church was at its peak. The objective of clerico-nationalists was promoting the values of traditional society: family, French, the Catholic Church and rural life. Events such as the [[North-West Rebellion]], the [[Manitoba Schools Question]] and Ontario's [[Regulation 17]] turned the promotion and defence of the rights of French Canadians into an important concern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alloprof.qc.ca/fr/eleves/bv/histoire/le-nationalisme-canadien-francais-h1401|title=Le nationalisme canadien-francais|publisher=Allo Prof|accessdate=July 5, 2021}}</ref> Under the aegis of the Catholic Church and the political action of [[Henri Bourassa]], symbols of national pride were developed, like the [[Flag of Carillon]], and "[[O Canada]]" &ndash; a patriotic song composed for [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]]. Many organizations went on to consecrate the affirmation of the French-Canadian people, including the [[caisses populaires Desjardins]] in 1900, the [[Club de hockey Canadien]] in 1909, ''[[Le Devoir]]'' in 1910, the [[Congress on the French language in Canada]] in 1912, and ''[[L'Action nationale]]'' in 1917. In 1885, liberal and conservative MPs formed the [[Parti national]] out of anger with the previous government for not having interceded in the execution of [[Louis Riel]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/parti-national|title=Parti national |language=fr|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|date=February 19, 2014}}</ref>

When World War I broke out, Canada was automatically involved and many English Canadians volunteered. However, because they did not feel the same connection to the British Empire and there was no direct threat to Canada, French Canadians saw no reason to fight. By late 1916, casualties were beginning to cause reinforcement problems. After enormous difficulty in the federal government, because almost every French-speaking MP opposed conscription while almost all English-speaking MPs supported it, the ''Military Service Act'' became law on August 29, 1917.<ref name="Conscription au Canada">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/conscription|title=Conscription au Canada|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|date=May 6, 2021}}</ref> French Canadians protested in what is now called the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], which led to the {{ill|Quebec riot|fr|Émeute de Québec de 1918}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warmuseum.ca/learn/dispatches/french-canada-and-recruitment-during-the-first-world-war/#tabs|title=FRENCH CANADA AND RECRUITMENT DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR|publisher=Canadian War Museum|accessdate=September 12, 2021}}</ref>

[[File:Maurice Duplessis.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maurice Duplessis]], premier of Quebec from 1936 to 1939 and during the {{lang|fr|[[Grande Noirceur]]}}]]
French Canadians remained opposed to conscription during the Second World War. When Canada declared war in September 1939, the federal government pledged not to conscript soldiers for overseas service. As the war went on, more and more English Canadians voiced support for conscription, despite firm opposition from French Canada. Following a 1942 poll that showed 73% of Quebec's residents were ''against'' conscription, while 80% or more were ''for'' conscription in every other province, the federal government passed ''Bill 80'' for overseas service. [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Protests exploded]] and the [[Bloc Populaire]] emerged to fight conscription.<ref name="Conscription au Canada"/> The stark differences between the values of French and English Canada popularized the expression the "[[Two Solitudes (Canadian society)|Two Solitudes]]".

In the wake of the conscription crisis, [[Maurice Duplessis]] of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] ascended to power and implemented conservative policies known as the {{lang|fr|[[Grande Noirceur]]}}. He focused on defending [[Autonomism in Quebec|provincial autonomy]], Quebec's Catholic and francophone heritage, and laissez-faire [[liberalism]] instead of the emerging [[welfare state]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=GÉLINAS|first1= Xavier |first2=Lucia |last2=Ferretti|title=Duplessis : son milieu, son époque|publisher=Septentrion|year= 2010|page=267|isbn=978-2-89448-625-2}}</ref> However, as early as 1948, French Canadian society began to develop new ideologies and desires in response to societal changes such as the television, the [[Mid-20th century baby boom|baby boom]], [[Strike action|workers' conflicts]], electrification of the countryside, emergence of a [[middle class]], the [[rural exodus]] and [[urbanization]], expansion of universities and bureaucracies, creation of [[Autoroutes of Quebec|motorways]], renaissance of literature and poetry, and others.

Located in the [[Eastern Canada|eastern part]] of Canada, Quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of [[France]] or [[Texas]]. Most of Quebec is very sparsely populated.<ref>{{cite web|author=Institut de la statistique du Québec |title=Comparaison entre la superficie du Québec et celle de divers pays |trans-title=Comparison between the area of Quebec and various countries|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/jeunesse/territoire/compa_superf_pays.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808030517/http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/jeunesse/territoire/compa_superf_pays.htm|archivedate=August 8, 2011|accessdate=July 4, 2011|publisher=Government of Quebec|language=fr}}</ref> The most populous [[Physical geography|physiographic]] region is the [[Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands]]. The combination of rich soils and the lowlands' relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of Quebec. The rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to the seigneurial system.

Quebec's [[topography]] is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground, the climate, and the proximity to water.

===Ministries and policies===
Quebec's constitution is enshrined in a series of social and cultural traditions that are defined in a set of judicial judgments and legislative documents, including the {{lang|fr|Loi sur l'Assemblée Nationale}} ("Law on the National Assembly"), the {{lang|fr|Loi sur l'éxecutif}} ("Law on the Executive"), and the {{lang|fr|Loi électorale du Québec}} ("Electoral Law of Quebec").<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Les Publications du Québec|Éditeur officiel du Québec]]|title=Loi électorale (L.R.Q., c E-3.3)|url=http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/E_3_3/E3_3.html|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref> Other notable examples include the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Charter of the French language]], and the [[Civil Code of Quebec]].<ref name="CCQ2">{{cite web|date=October 28, 2011|title=Code civil du Québec, L.R.Q.|url=http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=%2FCCQ%2FCCQ.html|access-date=June 6, 2021|archive-date=September 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913110920/http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Quebec's immigration philosophy is based on the principles of pluralism and [[interculturalism]].The {{lang|fr|Ministère de l'Immigration et des Communautés culturelles du Québec}} is responsible for the selection and integration of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accord Canada-Québec relatif à l'immigration et à l'admission temporaire des aubains (Accord Gagnon-Tremblay—McDougall)|url=http://www.micc.gouv.qc.ca/publications/fr/divers/Accord-canada-quebec-immigration-francais.pdf|accessdate=July 30, 2019|publisher=Government of Quebec|archive-date=June 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614152839/http://www.micc.gouv.qc.ca/publications/fr/divers/Accord-canada-quebec-immigration-francais.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Programs favour immigrants who know French, have a low risk of becoming criminals and have in-demand skills.

Quebec's health and social services network is administered by the [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Ministry of Health and Social Services]]. It is composed of 95 {{lang|fr|réseaux locaux de services}} (RLS; 'local service networks') and 18 {{lang|fr|agences de la santé et des services sociaux}} (ASSS; 'health and social services agencies'). Quebec's health system is supported by the ''[[Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec]]'' (RAMQ) which works to maintain the accessibility of services for all citizens of Quebec.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Les Publications du Québec|Éditeur officiel du Québec]]|title=Loi sur la Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (L.R.Q., c.

Part of the reason for this is that tuition fees were frozen to a relatively low level when CEGEPS were created during the Quiet Revolution. When Jean Charest's government decided in 2012 to sharply increase university fees, [[2012 Quebec student protests|students protests]] erupted.<ref>{{cite web|first=Pascale|last=Dufour|date=June 1, 2012|title=Ténacité des étudiants québécois|url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2012/06/DUFOUR/47888|website=Le Monde diplomatique}}</ref> Because of these protests, Quebec's tuition fees remain relatively low.

===External relationships===
Quebec's closest international partner is the United States, with which it shares a long and positive history. Products of [[American culture]] like songs, movies, fashion and food strongly affect Québécois culture.

Quebec has a historied relationship with France, as Quebec was a part of the French Empire and both regions share a language. The {{ill|Fédération France-Québec|fr|Fédération France-Québec}} and the [[Francophonie]] are a few of the tools used for relations between Quebec and France. In [[Paris]], a {{lang|fr|place du Québec}} was inaugurated in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=La place du Québec à Paris dans toute sa splendeur|url=http://www.consulfrance-quebec.org/La-place-du-Quebec-a-Paris-dans|publisher=Consulat général de France à Québec|accessdate=September 12, 2021}}</ref> Quebec also has a historied relationship with the United Kingdom, having been a part of the British Empire. Quebec and the UK share the same head of state, [[King Charles III]].

Quebec has a [[Quebec Government Offices|network of 32 offices]] in 18 countries. These offices serve the purpose of representing Quebec in foreign countries and are overseen by Quebec's [[Ministry of International Relations (Quebec)|Ministry of International Relations]]. Quebec, like other Canadian provinces, also maintains representatives in some Canadian embassies and consulates general. {{As of|2019}}, the Government of Quebec had delegates-general ([[agents-general]]) in [[Brussels]], [[London]], [[Mexico City]], [[Munich]], [[New York City]], Paris and [[Tokyo]]; delegates to [[Atlanta]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Rome]]; and offices headed by directors offering more limited services in [[Barcelona]], [[Beijing]], [[Dakar]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Mumbai]], [[São Paulo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Stockholm]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. In addition, there are the equivalent of [[Consul (representative)#honorary consul|honorary consuls]], titled {{lang|fr|antennes}}, in [[Berlin]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Qingdao]], [[Seoul]], and [[Silicon Valley]].

Quebec also has a representative to [[UNESCO]] and participates in the [[Organization of American States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mrif.gouv.qc.ca/fr/ministere/representation-etranger |title=Réseau des représentations à l'étranger|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=September 12, 2021}}</ref> Quebec is a member of the {{lang|fr|i=no|[[Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie]]}} and of the {{lang|fr|i=no|[[Organisation internationale de la francophonie]]}}.

==Law==
{{Main|Quebec law|Bar of Quebec}}
[[File:Edifice_Ernest-Cormier_14.JPG|thumb|The [[Édifice Ernest-Cormier]] is the courthouse for the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in Montreal]]
Quebec law is the shared responsibility of the [[Government of Canada|federal]] and [[Government of Quebec|provincial government]]. The federal government is responsible for [[criminal law]], foreign affairs and laws relating to the regulation of Canadian commerce, interprovincial transportation, and telecommunications.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-3.html#docCont|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, THE CONSTITUTION ACTS, 1867 to 1982|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|date=August 7, 2020|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}</ref> The provincial government is responsible for [[private law]], the administration of justice, and several social domains, such as social assistance, healthcare, education, and natural resources.<ref name="auto1"/>

Quebec law is influenced by two judicial traditions ([[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]]) and four classic [[sources of law]] ([[legislation]], [[case law]], doctrine and [[customary law]]).{{sfn|Kélada|1970|p=21}} Private law in Quebec affects all relationships between individuals ([[Natural person|natural]] or [[Juridical person|juridical]] persons) and is largely under the jurisdiction of the [[Parliament of Quebec]]. The [[Parliament of Canada]] also influences Quebec private law, in particular through its power over banks, bankruptcy, marriage, divorce and [[maritime law]].{{sfn|Brun|Tremblay|Brouillet|2008|pp=474–491}} The ''{{ill|Droit civil du Québec|fr|Droit civil du Québec}}'' is the primary component of Quebec's private law and is [[Codification (law)|codified]] in the [[Civil Code of Quebec]].{{sfn|Émond|Lauzière|2003|p=38}} Public law in Quebec is largely derived from the common law tradition.{{sfn|Brun|Tremblay|Brouillet|2008|pp=9, 28}} Quebec [[constitutional law]] governs the rules surrounding the Quebec government, the Parliament of Quebec and Quebec's courts. Quebec [[administrative law]] governs relations between individuals and the Quebec public administration. Quebec also has some limited jurisdiction over criminal law. Finally, Quebec, like the federal government, has [[tax law]] power.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lord|first1=Guy|title=Les principes de l'imposition au Canada|last2=Sasseville|first2=Jacques|last3=Bruneau|first3=Diane|last4=Lachance|first4=Renaud|year=1998|editor=Wilson & Lafleur|edition=12|pages=11–13, 20–23|oclc=47248281}}</ref> Certain portions of Quebec law are considered mixed. This is the case, for example, with [[human rights and freedoms]] which are governed by the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]], a Charter which applies to both government and citizens.{{sfn|Émond|Lauzière|2003|pp=39–40}}{{sfn|Brun|Tremblay|Brouillet|2008|pp=943–945}}

===Courts===
Although Quebec is a civil law jurisdiction, it does not follow the pattern of other civil law systems which have court systems divided by subject matter. Instead, the court system follows the English model of unitary courts of general jurisdiction. The provincial courts have jurisdiction to decide matters under [[provincial law]] as well as [[federal law]], including [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]], [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[constitutional law|constitutional matters]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Duplé|first=Nicole|title=Droit constitutionnel : principes fondamentaux|year=2009|editor=Wilson & Lafleur|edition=4|page=729|oclc=373349446}}</ref> The major exception to the principle of general jurisdiction is that the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] and [[Federal Court of Appeal]] have exclusive jurisdiction over some areas of federal law, such as review of federal administrative bodies, federal taxes, and matters relating to national security.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title =Federal Courts Act|abbr =RSC|year =1985|chapter =F-7|link =https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-7/index.html}}</ref>

The Quebec courts are organized in a pyramid. At the bottom, there are the [[municipal court]]s, the Professions Tribunal, the Human Rights Tribunal, and administrative tribunals. Decisions of those bodies can be reviewed by the two trial courts, the [[Court of Quebec]] the [[Superior Court of Quebec]]. The Court of Quebec is the main criminal trial court, and also a court for small civil claims. The Superior Court is a trial court of general jurisdiction, in both criminal and civil matters. The decisions of those courts can be appealed to the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]]. Finally, if the case is of great importance, it may be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].

The Court of Appeal serves two purposes. First, it is the general court of appeal for all legal issues from the lower courts. It hears appeals from the trial decisions of the Superior Court and the Quebec Court. It also can hear appeals from decisions rendered by those two courts on appeals or judicial review matters relating to the municipal courts and administrative tribunals.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title =Code of Civil Procedure|abbr =CQLR|year =|chapter =C-25.01|section =29|link =http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/c-25.01}}</ref> Second, but much more rarely, the Court of Appeal possesses the power to respond to [[reference question]]s posed to it by the [[Executive Council of Quebec|Quebec Cabinet]]. The Court of Appeal renders more than 1,500 judgments per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vadnais|first=Louise|year=2000|title=Les caméras en Cour d'appel|url=http://www.barreau.qc.ca/publications/journal/vol32/no8/cameras.html|journal=Le Journal du Barreau|volume=32|number=8|access-date=April 29, 2021|archive-date=February 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212235906/http://www.barreau.qc.ca/publications/journal/vol32/no8/cameras.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Law enforcement===
The [[Sûreté du Québec]] is the main police force of Quebec. The Sûreté du Québec can also serve a support and coordination role with other police forces, such as with municipal police forces or with the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Loi sur la police, L.R.Q.

In the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]], Quebec had a population of 8,164,361, a 3.3% increase from its 2011 population of 7,903,001. With a land area of {{convert|1,356,625.27|km2|abbr=on}}, it had a population density of {{Pop density|8164361|1356625.27|km2|sqmi|prec=1}} in 2016. Quebec accounts for a little under 23% of the Canadian population. The [[List of population centres in Quebec|most populated cities in Quebec]] are [[Montreal]] (1,762,976), [[Quebec City]] (538,738), [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]] (431,208), and [[Gatineau, Quebec|Gatineau]] (281,501).<ref>{{cite web|date=2017|title=La population des municipalités du Québec au 1er juillet 2017|url=https://statistique.quebec.ca/fr/fichier/la-population-des-municipalites-du-quebec-au-1er-juillet-2017.pdf|publisher=Institut de la statistique du Québec|accessdate=September 12, 2021}}</ref>

In 2016, Quebec's median age was 41.2 years. As of 2020, 20.8% of the population were younger than 20, 59.5% were aged between 20 and 64, and 19.7% were 65 or older. In 2019, Quebec witnessed an increase in the number of births compared to the year before (84,200 vs 83,840) and had a [[total fertility rate]] of about 1.6 children born per woman. As of 2020, the average life expectancy was 82.3 years. Quebec in 2019 registered the highest rate of population growth since 1972, with an increase of 110,000 people, mostly because of the arrival of a high number of immigrants. As of 2019, most international immigrants came from China, India or France.<ref name=":42">{{cite web|title=Bilan demographique du Québec |edition= 2020 |language=fr |url=https://statistique.quebec.ca/fr/fichier/bilan-demographique-du-quebec-edition-2020.pdf |publisher=Institut de la statistique du Québec |accessdate=August 14, 2021}}</ref> In 2016, 30% of the population possessed a [[postsecondary]] degree or diploma.

In 1978, the [[Naskapi]]s joined the agreement when the [[Northeastern Quebec Agreement]] was signed.

===Acadians===
The subject of {{ill|Acadians in Quebec|fr|Acadiens au Québec}} is an important one as more than a million people in Quebec are of [[Acadians|Acadian]] descent, with roughly 4.8 million people possessing one or multiple Acadian ancestors in their genealogy tree, because a large number of Acadians had fled [[Acadia]] to take refuge in Quebec during the [[Great Upheaval]]. Furthermore, more than a million people have a [[patronym]] of Acadian origin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Québec|url=http://snacadie.org/content/view/106/130/|accessdate=December 7, 2009|publisher=Société nationale de l'Acadie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|year=1998|title=L'Acadie du Québec - Du 29 mars au 31 mai 1998|url=http://www.teleco.org/museeacadien/francais/expopre2.html|accessdate=December 7, 2009|publisher=Télécommunauté insulaire francophone|archive-date=October 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013014454/http://www.teleco.org/museeacadien/francais/expopre2.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Adrien|last=Bergeron|year=2000|title=HÉBERT, ÉTIENNE|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-f.php?&id_nbr=2928&&PHPSESSID=ychzfqkvzape|accessdate=December 7, 2009|publisher=Dictionnaire biographique du Canada en ligne en collaboration avec l'Université de Toronto et l'Université Laval}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hébert|first1=Pierre-Maurice|title=Les Acadiens du Québec|date=1994|publisher=Éditions de L'Écho|isbn=2-920312-32-4|volume=427|language=fr}}</ref>

Quebec houses Acadian communities. Acadians mainly live on the [[Magdalen Islands]] and in [[Gaspesia]], but about thirty other communities are present elsewhere in Quebec, mostly in the [[Côte-Nord]] and [[Centre-du-Québec]] regions. An Acadian community in Quebec can be called a "Cadie", "Petite Cadie" or "Cadien".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arsenault|first1=Samuel|title=L'Acadie des Maritimes : études thématiques des débuts à nos jours|last2=Lamarche|first2=Rodolphe|last3=Daigle|first3=Jean|date=1993|publisher=[[:fr:Centre d'études acadiennes Anselme-Chiasson|Centre d'études acadiennes, Université de Moncton]]|isbn=2921166062|volume=Les géographes et l'aménagement des structures spatiales}}</ref>

{{See also|List of universities in Quebec|List of colleges in Quebec|List of schools in Quebec}}
The education system of Quebec, administered by the government of Quebec's [[Ministry of Education and Higher Education (Quebec)|Ministry of Education and Higher Education]], differs from those of other Canadian provinces. The province has five levels of education: first {{ill|Preschool, primary and secondary education in Quebec|lt=preschool, then primary school, then secondary school|fr|Éducation préscolaire, primaire et secondaire au Québec}}; then [[CEGEP]] (see [[College education in Quebec]]); and finally [[Higher education in Quebec|university or college]]. Attached to these levels are the options to also attend [[professional development]] opportunities, [[Andragogy|classes for adults]], and [[continuing education]]. For every level of teaching, there exists a public network and private network: the public network is financed by taxes while the private options must be paid for by the student. In 2020, [[school boards]] were replaced by [[school service centre]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bill 40, An Act to amend mainly the Education Act with regard to school organization and governance |publisher=National Assembly of Québec|url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-40-42-1.html?appelant=MC|accessdate=August 23, 2020}}</ref>

All universities in Quebec exist by virtue of laws adopted by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] in 1967 during the [[Quiet Revolution]]. Their financing mostly comes from public taxes, but the laws under which they operate grants them more autonomy than other levels of education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/site_web/documents/PSG/politiques_orientations/rapport_comiteCS_mai2014v3p.pdf |title=Rapport comite|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=September 12, 2021}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
Quebec has a health policy that emphasizes prevention, is based on the analysis of health-related data, and evolves with the needs of the population. Similar to other developed economies, the public health policies implemented in Quebec have extended the life expectancy of its population since the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/demograp/pdf2006/Bilan2006.pdf|title= La situation démographique au Québec|work= Bilan 2006|publisher= Institut de la statistique du Québec|isbn= 2-550-48491-6|page= 53|access-date= April 29, 2021|archive-date= July 5, 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070705142621/http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/demograp/pdf2006/Bilan2006.pdf|url-status= dead}}</ref>

Health and social services are part of the same administration. The Quebec health system is also public, which means that the [[État québécois|government]] acts as the main insurer and administrator, that funding is provided by general taxation, and that patients have access to care regardless of their income level.

There are 34 health establishments in Quebec, 22 of which are an {{ill|Integrated Health and Social Services Centre|fr|Centre intégré de santé et de services sociaux}} (CISSS). They ensure the distribution of different services on the territories they are assigned to. Quebec has approximately 140 hospitals for general or specialised care (CHSGS).

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Quebec}}
Quebec has developed its own unique culture from its historic [[New France]] roots. Its culture also symbolizes a distinct perspective: being a French-speaking nation surrounded by a bigger English-speaking culture.

The [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Quartier Latin]] (English: Latin Quarter) of Montreal, and Vieux-Québec (English: [[Old Quebec]]) in Quebec City are two hubs of metropolitan cultural activity. Life in the cafés and "terrasses" (outdoor restaurant terraces) reveals a Latin influence in Quebec's culture, with the [[théâtre Saint-Denis]] in Montreal and the [[Capitole de Québec]] theatre in Quebec City being among the principal attractions.

A number of governmental and non-government organizations support cultural activity in Quebec. The [[Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec]] (CALQ) is an initiative of the [[Ministry of Culture and Communications (Quebec)]]. It supports creation, innovation, production, and international exhibits for all cultural fields of Quebec. The [[Société de développement des entreprises culturelles]] (SODEC) works to promote and fund individuals working in the cultural industry. The [[Prix du Québec]] is an award given by the government to confer the highest distinction and honour to individuals demonstrating exceptional achievement in their respective cultural field. Other awards include the Athanase David Awards (Literature), [[Félix Awards]] (Music), [[Gémeaux Awards]] (Television and film), [[Jutra Awards]] (Cinema), Masques Awards (Theatre), [[Olivier Guimond]] Awards (Humour) and the Opus Awards (Concert music).

===Performing arts===

Quebec's architecture is characterized by its unique [[Canadien]]-style buildings as well as the juxtaposition of a variety of styles reflective of Quebec's history. When walking in any city or town, one can come across buildings with styles congruent to [[Classical architecture|Classical]], [[Neo-Gothic]], [[Roman architecture|Roman]], [[Neo-Renaissance]], [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[Neo-classical architecture|Neo-Classical]], Québécois Neo-Classical, [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]], [[Modern architecture|Modern]], [[Post-modern architecture|Post-modern]] or [[Skyscrapers]].

Canadien-style houses and barns were developed by the first settlers of New France along the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. These buildings are rectangular one-storey structures with an extremely tall and steep roof, sometimes almost twice as tall as the house below. Canadien-style churches also developed and served as landmarks while traversing rural Quebec.

In 1977, the [[Quebec Parliament]] declared June 24, the day of {{lang|fr|La Saint-Jean-Baptiste}}, to be [[Quebec's National Holiday]]. {{lang|fr|La Saint-Jean-Baptiste}}, or {{lang|fr|La St-Jean}}, honours [[French Canada]]'s patron saint, [[John the Baptist]]. On this day, the song "[[Gens du pays]]", by [[Gilles Vigneault]], is often heard. The song ''[[À la claire fontaine]]''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=À la claire fontaine|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/a-la-claire-fontaine-emc/|accessdate=July 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806082946/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000031|archivedate=August 6, 2011|author=Plouffe, Hélène|url-status=live}}</ref> was the anthem of the [[New France]], [[Patriote movement|Patriots]] and [[French Canadian]], then replaced by ''[[O Canada]]'', but "Gens du pays" is preferred by many Quebecers to be the national anthem of Quebec.

[[National Patriots' Day]], a statutory holiday in Quebec, is also a unique public holiday, which honours the [[Patriote movement|patriotes]] with displays of the [[patriote flag]], music, public speeches, and ceremonies.<ref name="law2">{{cite periodical|title=Décret no 1322-2002 concernant la Journée nationale des Patriotes|url=http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=1&file=39585.PDF|volume=134|page=8463|accessdate=January 12, 2013|periodical=[[Gazette officielle du Québec]]|series=partie II|number=50}}</ref> ''[[Le Vieux de '37]]'' ("The Old Man of '37"), an illustration by [[Henri Julien]] that depicts a patriot of this rebellion,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://150ans150oeuvres.uqam.ca/fr/oeuvre/1970-un-vieux-de-37-de-henri-julien/#description|title=Une vieux de 37 de Henri Julien|publisher=UQAM|accessdate=September 12, 2021|archive-date=September 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210917185047/https://150ans150oeuvres.uqam.ca/fr/oeuvre/1970-un-vieux-de-37-de-henri-julien/#description|url-status=dead}}</ref> is sometimes added at the centre of [[Patriote flags]]. [[Moving Day (Quebec)|Moving Day]] is a tradition where leases terminate on July 1. This creates a [[social phenomenon]] where everyone seems to be moving out at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://immigrantquebec.com/fr/actualites/actualites/1er-juillet-grand-demenagement-montreal |title=Jour du grand demenagement|work=immigrantquebec.com|accessdate=September 12, 2021}}</ref>

Other distinct holiday traditions include the [[Réveillon]], a giant feast and party which takes place during [[Christmas Eve]] and [[New Year's Eve]] and goes on until midnight. Traditional dishes like [[tourtière]] or [[Sea-pie|cipâte]] are offered, and [[rigaudon]], [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoon]] or [[violin]] may be played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bv.cdeacf.ca/bvdoc.php?no=23309&col=RA&format=htm |title=Le temps des fêtes au Québec|accessdate=September 12, 2021|website=cdeacf.ca}}</ref> Finally, [[April Fools' Day]] is called ''Poisson d'Avril'' ("April's Fish") because while pulling pranks is still important, there is another major tradition: sticking fish-shaped paper cutouts to people's backs without them noticing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collegecdi.ca/quebec/connectez-vous/actualites/quelles-sont-les-origines-du-poisson-d-avril/ |title=Quelles sont les origines du Poisson d'Avril|accessdate=September 12, 2021|website=collegcdi.ca}}</ref>

In 1939, the [[government of Quebec]] unilaterally ratified its [[Coat of arms of Quebec|coat of arms]] to reflect [[History of Quebec|Quebec's political history]]: French rule (gold lily on blue background), followed by British rule (lion on red background), followed by Canadian rule (maple leaves).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/ |website=Justice Québec|title=Drapeauet et symboles nationaux|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009212247/http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/|archivedate=October 9, 2007|language=fr}}</ref> [[Je me souviens]] ("I remember") is an official part of the coat of arms and has been the official licence plate motto since 1978, replacing the previous motto: ''La belle province'' ("the beautiful province"), still used as a nickname for the province. The [[fleur-de-lis]], one of Quebec's most common symbols, is an ancient symbol of the [[French monarchy]]. Finally, the [[Great Seal of Quebec]] is used to authenticate documents issued by the government of Quebec.

The first members of the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]] created the ''Carillon Sacré-Coeur'' flag, which consisted of a white cross on an azure background with white fleur-de-lis in each corner and a [[Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart imagery|Sacred Heart]] surrounded by [[Maple leaf|maple leaves]] in the centre; it was based on the French merchant flag flown by Champlain and the [[Flag of Carillon]]. The ''Carillon Sacré-Coeur'' and French merchant flag went on to be the major inspirations for creating Quebec's current flag in 1903, called the ''[[Fleurdelisé]]''. The ''Fleurdelisé'' replaced the [[Union Jack]] on Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] on January 21, 1948.

==Emblems of Quebec==
There are three official emblems in Quebec:

<gallery mode="packed" caption="Emblems">
File:Iris versicolor.jpg|[[Iris versicolor]] Flower
File:Snowy Owl (240866707).jpeg|[[Snowy owl|Bubo scandiacus]], Snowy owl
File:Betula_alleghaniensis_000_2333_3466.jpg|[[Betula alleghaniensis]] Tree
File:Betula_alleghaniensis_008.jpg |[[Betula alleghaniensis]] Bark
</gallery>

* '''''[[Iris versicolor]]''''' Linné. — Iris versicolore. — Clajeux. — (Larger blue-flag), the floral emblem of Quebec since 1999. 
Through the variety and harmony of the colors of its flower, the versicolor iris perfectly illustrates the cultural diversity of Quebec. It also underlines the importance of water and wetlands for the balance of nature.

* '''''[[Snowy owl|Bubo scandiacus]]'''''. — Harfang des neiges. — Snowy owl, the avian emblem of Quebec since 1987.
The owl symbolizes the whiteness of Quebec winters, roots in a semi-northern climate and extension over a very vast territory.
* '''''[[Betula alleghaniensis]]''''' Britton. — Bouleau des Alléghanys. — Merisier. — Yellow birch, forest emblem since 1993.

Colloquially called ''Merisier'', yellow birch, in addition to being one of the best-known noble woods in Quebec, is distinguished by the variety of its uses and by its commercial value. It was picked to emphasize the importance Québécois give to the forests.<ref name="Qsymbols2">{{cite web|author=Quebec Portal|date=May 7, 2015|title=Quebec's Symbols|url=https://www.sqrc.gouv.qc.ca/representation-quebec-canada/le-quebec/symboles-en.asp|accessdate=August 27, 2020|publisher=Government of Quebec}}</ref><ref name="Emblems of Quebec">{{cite web |title=Emblems of Quebec |url=https://www.quebec.ca/gouvernement/portrait-quebec/drapeau-symboles-nationaux/emblemes |website=Quebec Gouvernement |access-date=25 June 2024 |language=fr |date=2024 |quote=There are three official emblems in Quebec: the yellow birch, the snowy owl and the versicolor iris.}}</ref>

==Quebec's diaspora==
{{Main article|Quebec diaspora}}

The earliest immigrants to the [[Canadian prairies]] were [[French Canadians]] from Quebec. Many [[Franco-Albertans]], [[Fransaskois]] and [[Franco-Manitobans]] are descended from them.

From the mid-1800s to the [[Great Depression]], Quebec experienced the [[Grande Hémorragie]] ("Great Hemorrhaging"), a massive emigration of 900,000 people from Quebec to [[New England]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bélanger|first=Claude|title=Emigration to the United States from Canada and Quebec, 1840–1940|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/stats/goto-us.htm|accessdate=July 24, 2013|work=Quebec History|publisher=Marianopolis College}}</ref> French Canadians often established themselves in [[Little Canadas]] in many industrial New England centres. Of the 900,000 Québécois who emigrated, about half returned.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bélanger, Claude|date=August 23, 2000|title=Rapatriement|url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/events/repatr.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213234956/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/events/repatr.htm|archivedate=February 13, 2007|publisher= Marianopolis College}}</ref> Most of the descendants of those who stayed are now [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]], though a few [[Franco-Americans]] remain, speaking [[New England French]].

Some tried to slow the Grande Hémorragie by redirecting people north, which resulted in the founding of many regions in Quebec (ex. [[Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean]], [[Val-d'Or]]) but also in [[Northeastern Ontario]]. The northeastern [[Franco-Ontarian]]s of today, who live in [[Timmins]], [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]], [[Moosonee]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Sainte Marie]], among others, are the descendants of emigrants from Quebec who worked in the mines of the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Nord franco-ontarien : nature, culture et hospitalité|url=https://corridorcanada.ca/resource/le-nord-franco-ontarien-nature-culture-et-chaleur-humaine/|accessdate=May 12, 2021|work=Le Corridor}}</ref>

In recent times, [[Snowbird (person)|snowbirds]] often migrate to southern [[Florida]] during the winter, resulting in the emergence of temporary "Québécois regions".
