{{nihongo|'''Kitakyushu'''|北九州市|Kitakyūshū-shi|lead=yes}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. As of June 1, 2019, Kitakyushu has an estimated population of 940,978, making it the second-largest city in both Fukuoka Prefecture and the island of [[Kyushu]] after the city of [[Fukuoka]]. It is one of Japan's 20 [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated cities]], one of three on Kyushu, and is divided into seven [[Wards of Japan|wards]].

Kitakyushu was formed in 1963 from a merger of municipalities centered on the historic city of [[Kokura]], and its name literally means "North Kyushu City" in Japanese. It is located at the northernmost point of Kyushu on the [[Kanmon Straits]], separating the island from [[Honshu]], across from the city of [[Shimonoseki]]. Kitakyushu and Shimonoseki are connected by numerous transport links including the [[Kanmon Bridge]] and the Kanmon Tunnels ([[Kanmon Roadway Tunnel|Roadway]], [[Kanmon Railway Tunnel|Railway]], and [[Shin-Kanmon Tunnel|Shin-Kanmon]]). Kitakyushu's [[Urban Employment Area]] forms part of the [[Fukuoka-Kitakyushu|Fukuoka-Kitakyushu Greater Metropolitan Region]], which, with a population of 5,738,977 (2005-2006), is the largest [[metropolitan area]] in Japan west of the [[Keihanshin]] region.

==History==
===Kokura Prefecture===
[[Kokura Prefecture]] was founded separately from [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] in 1871 when the clan system was abolished. The old wooden-built Kokura Prefectural Office is still standing and is being restored. It is opposite [[Riverwalk Kitakyūshū]]. In 1876, Kokura Prefecture was absorbed by Fukuoka Prefecture. The city of [[Kokura]] was founded in 1900.

===World War II===
Yahata in Kitakyushu was the target for the beginning of the US bombing raids on the home islands on June 16, 1944, when 75 [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es flew out from mainland China.<ref>[[Shigeru Mizuki]], A History of Japan Vol 3 Showa 1944-1953, p.152</ref>

Kokura was the primary target of the nuclear weapon "[[Fat Man]]" on August 9, 1945. Major [[Charles Sweeney]] had orders to drop the bomb visually. All three attempts failed due to clouds and smoke from [[Yahata, Fukuoka|Yahata]], which is only {{Convert|7|km|abbr=on}} west of Kokura and had air raids on the previous day, preventing him from identifying the target clearly. Additionally, a smoke screen was created by industrial workers burning barrels of coal tar and/or electric plant workers releasing steam.<ref>{{cite news|title=Steel mill worker reveals blocking view of U.S. aircraft on day of Nagasaki atomic bombing|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20140726p2a00m0na014000c.html|access-date=29 July 2014|work=Mainichi|publisher=Mainichi Japan|date=26 July 2014|archive-date=22 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122171430/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20140726p2a00m0na014000c.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nagasaki: The Last Bomb|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/nagasaki-the-last-bomb|access-date=8 August 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=7 August 2015}}</ref> The bomb was ultimately dropped on the city of [[Nagasaki]], the secondary target, at 11:02 JST.

===City===
The city of Kitakyushu was founded on February 10, 1963, and was designated on April 1, 1963, by [[City designated by government ordinance|government ordinance]]. The city was born from the merger of five municipalities (Moji, Kokura, Tobata, Yahata and Wakamatsu) centered around the ancient feudal city of Kokura. The city's symbol mark is a flower with the [[kanji|character]] {{nihongo|"north"|北|''kita''}} in the middle and five petals representing the towns that merged.

==Geography and administrative divisions==
===Demographics===
{{as of|2018|October|1}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 945,595 and a total area of {{cvt|491.95|km2}}.<ref name="yokohamaPop">{{cite web |url=http://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/ex/stat/jinko/city/new-e.html |title=Population News of Major Cities |date=Oct 1, 2018 |publisher=City of Yokohama |access-date=2018-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113184700/http://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/ex/stat/jinko/city/new-e.html |archive-date=January 13, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The average [[population density]] is {{cvt|1922|/km2||adj=pre|persons}}.

The city of [[Nakama, Fukuoka]] was to become the eighth [[Wards of Japan|ward]] of Kitakyushu in 2005 (to be called Nakama-ku). However, the merger was rejected on December 24, 2004 by Nakama's city council, despite having been initiated by Nakama City.

A smaller scale shopping center known as Cha Cha Town, next to the Sunatsu bus depot in Kokura Kita ward, was created by the [[Nishi-Nippon Railroad]] and bus company.

In 2009 [[Bridgestone]] Corporation opened a plant in Kitakyushu to produce large and ultralarge off-the-road radial tires for construction and mining vehicles.

The [[GDP]] in Greater Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu [[Urban Employment Area|Metropolitan Employment Area]] was US$55.7 billion in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/UEA/uea_data_e.htm|title = Metropolitan Employment Area (MEA) Data|author = Yoshitsugu Kanemoto|publisher = Center for Spatial Information Science, The [[University of Tokyo]]}}</ref><ref>[https://data.oecd.org/conversion/exchange-rates.htm Conversion rates - Exchange rates] - OECD Data</ref>

Located at a strategic position on the south side of the [[Kanmon Straits]], Kitakyushu is an important transport hub for traffic between [[Honshu]] and [[Kyushu]] and has a large port.

===Air===
====Airport====
The [[Kitakyushu Airport]] opened on March 16, 2006. It is larger than the previous [[Kokura Airport]] and supports 24-hour operations thanks to its location on an artificial island in the [[Seto Inland Sea]]. It will eventually be connected with [[Kokura Station]] by a new fast rail link. A new airline based in the city called [[StarFlyer]] began operations when the airport opened.

===Railways===
[[Kokura Station]], the city's central train station, is the penultimate stop on the [[JR West]] [[Sanyō Shinkansen]] before the [[Hakata Station|Fukuoka]] terminus and all [[Shinkansen]] services stop here. It is served by local and express trains on [[JR Kyushu]]'s [[Kagoshima Main Line|Kagoshima]] and [[Nippō Main Line|Nippō]] Main Lines. In the city, transport is provided the [[Kitakyushu Monorail]] and buses.

[[Mojikō Station]] in [[Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū|Moji-ku]] is the northern terminus of the Kagoshima Main Line, the most important line in the JR Kyushu network.

A tram network operated by the [[Nishi-Nippon Railroad]] known as the Kitakyushu Line once operated in the city; after dwindling passenger numbers in the 1970s the line was shut down in stages between 1980 and 2000. A railway using tram cars, the [[Chikuhō Electric Railroad Line|Chikuhō Electric Railroad]], runs between {{STN|Kurosaki||Kurosaki-Ekimae}} and {{STN|Chikuhō-Nōgata}} stations, serving [[Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu|Yahatanishi-ku]] and the neighboring city of [[Nōgata, Fukuoka|Nōgata]].

===Roads===
====Expressways====
The metropolitan area of Kitakyushu is covered by the [[Kitakyushu Expressway]], which has five routes serving the city, totaling 53 kilometers of four-lane expressways. Some of these expressways are elevated, especially around the city center. Route 1 serves the city center, while route 2 serves the port area. Route 3 is a short connector between routes 1 and 2, and route 4 is the longest of the Kitakyushu Expressway network, serving most of the city from north to south. Route 5 is a short link serving the inner port area.

In addition, Kitakyushu is bypassed by the [[Kyushu Expressway]], the main north–south route on the island of Kyushu. The new [[Higashikyushu Expressway]] begins in Kitakyushu and runs along the eastern coast of Kyushu. North of Kitakyushu, the Kyushu Expressway crosses the six-lane [[Kanmonkyo Bridge]] and turns into the [[Chūgoku Expressway]], the second longest in Japan, serving western Honshu.

====Bridges====
There are several bridges in Kitakyushu and between the city and other places. The largest ones are the [[Kanmonkyo Bridge]] linking Kitakyushu and Shimonoseki (on Kyushu and Honshū respectively) via the [[Kanmon Straits]] and the [[Wakato Bridge]] linking the wards of Tobata and Wakamatsu. There are smaller bridges over the [[Onga River]] on the western border of the city.

On September 30, 2005, ownership of the Wakato Bridge was transferred from [[Japan Highway Public Corporation]] to Kitakyushu; on April 1, 2006, the bridge was transferred to the control of the [[Kitakyushu City Road Public Corporation]].

===Sea===
====Port====
Kitakyushu is the largest [[ferry]] port in [[Kyushu]], [[Chūgoku region|Chūgoku]], and [[Shikoku]]. Ferry services operate between Kitakyushu and [[Shimonoseki]], [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]], [[Tokushima, Tokushima|Tokushima]], [[Kōbe]], [[Ōsaka]], [[Tokyo]], [[Ulsan]] (Korea), [[Busan]] (Korea) and isolated islands in the city limits. The main ferry port is at Shin-Moji, and there are ferries at Moji and near [[Kokura Station]].

In the Kanmon-Kitakyushu area, there are three commuter lines: the Wakato Ferry, the Kanmon Straits Ferry, and the Kanmon Straits Liner.

* {{nihongo|[[Kokura Castle]]|小倉城|Kokura-jō}} was built by Hosokawa Tadaoki in 1602. It was the property of the Ogasawara clan (from Harima) between 1632 and 1860. The castle was burnt down in 1865 in the war between the Kokura and Choshu clans.
* {{nihongo|Hiraodai|平尾台||lit.

*[[Kawachi Wisteria Garden]] is known for massive   flower  trellises.
The limestone outcroppings on Hiraodai are said to resemble grazing sheep, so the plateau, the highest in Kyushu at 400–600 meters, is also known as the Yogun Plain.
Some of the limestone caverns are open to the public.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kyushu Tourism Promotion Organization |title=Kyushu's Must-See Tourist Spots|year=2010}}</ref> The area contains the Sugao and Nanae Waterfalls. Sugao is about 20 meters. Nanae means "seven stages".

==Culture==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}
The 1986 family movie ''[[The Adventures of Milo and Otis|Koneko Monogatari]]'' was filmed here. The English version of the film, which is the story of the friendship of a [[kitten]] and a [[pug]] dog, was released in America in 1989 as ''[[The Adventures of Milo and Otis]]''.

The 1958 comedy ''[[Rickshaw Man]]'' is based on a local folk hero of Kokura called Muhomatsu or "Wild Pine" and has been called the Japanese "Desperado". He is celebrated in the Kokura Gion Yamagasa festival. Toshiro Mifune plays the taiko drum in this movie.

Kitakyushu is featured in the late 2012 ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]'' game developed by [[Treyarch]] and published by [[Activision]] as a DLC map called ''Magma''. In the map the city has been abandoned due to a volcanic eruption, and parts of the city are completely covered in lava.

===Festivals===
