====Greater adjutant (Garuda) ====
[[File:Greater Adjutant.jpg|thumb|Greater adjutant]]
[[Greater adjutant]] (''Leptoptilos dubius''), a member of the [[stork]] family, associated with the mythical bird [[Garuda]], has a Rescue and Rehabilitation Area located in Bhagalpur, the second largest of its kind. Loss of nesting habitat and feeding sites through drainage, [[pollution]] and disturbance, together with hunting and egg collection, caused a massive dip in the population of the species. Garuda birds were first spotted nesting and breeding on a silk cotton tree near a village in the [[Ganga]]-Diara area in Bhagalpur in 2007. In May 2006, 42 birds were seen by the Mandar Nature Club team for the first time. Prior to this, the species had never been seen in [[Bihar]] during its breeding period. Four years after these endangered birds of the stork family started nesting and [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] in Bhagalpur district, their number eventually increased, from 78 to over 500,<ref>{{cite web|title=Garuda's population now 500 in Bhagalpur, Bihar|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/eco-news/garudas-population-now-500-in-bihar_1617481.html|website=Zee News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723004138/http://zeenews.india.com/news/eco-news/garudas-population-now-500-in-bihar_1617481.html|archive-date=23 July 2015|date=21 June 2015}}</ref> making Bhagalpur one of only three places to host Garudas; the others being [[Cambodia]] and Assam.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rescue and Rehabilitation centre was opened in Bhagalpur|url=http://epaper.prabhatkhabar.com/527659/BHAGALPUR-City/City#page/9/2|website=Prabhat Khabar|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721110423/http://epaper.prabhatkhabar.com/527659/BHAGALPUR-City/City#page/9/2|archive-date=21 July 2015}}</ref>

The [[greater adjutant]] is classified as endangered on the [[IUCN]] Red List 2004 of threatened species and listed under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. This huge stork has a naked pink head, a very thick yellow bill and a low-hanging neck pouch. The neck ruff is white. The bird looks like a vulture. Other than the pale grey edge on each wing, the rest of the greater adjutant's body is dark grey. Younglings have a narrower bill, thicker down on the head and neck, and entirely dark wings. A Garuda bird measures 145–150&nbsp;cm (about three feet) in length and four to five feet in height.<ref>{{cite web|title=World's third nestling spot for the 'Leptoptilos dubius' "Garuda"species is in Bhagalpur, Bihar|url=http://www.theweekendleader.com/Nature/820/garuda-returns.html|website=theweekendleader|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721184049/http://www.theweekendleader.com/Nature/820/garuda-returns.html|archive-date=21 July 2015}}</ref>

===Kali Puja===
[[Kali Puja]] is one of the most important festivals in and around the region. Several Kali Temples and Puja Mandaps are decked up on Deepawali to worship Kalika. The procession after the Puja is so long that it takes 36 hours to complete one big phase of Murti Bisarjan. Kali Puja holds the cultural significance of the Anga Region. The procession after the Puja is the intangible cultural asset to the city.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kumar |first1=Abhishek |title=Kali Puja 2021 भागलपुर में आज परबती की बुढिय़ा काली सहित 85 प्रतिमाओं की निकलेगी भव्‍य विसर्जन यात्रा - Kali Puja 2021: In Bhagalpur today 85 idols including Kali of Parbati will be immersed |url=https://www.jagran.com/bihar/bhagalpur-kali-puja-2021-in-bhagalpur-today-85-idols-including-kali-of-parbati-will-be-immersed-22181526.html |access-date=22 July 2023 |work=Jagran |date=6 November 2021 |language=hi}}</ref>

=== Sati Behula ===
In medieval [[Bengali literature]], Mansamangal is projected has heroine and a goddess. In the period from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, many works based on this story were made. The religious purpose of these works was to render the importance of goddess [[Manasa]],<ref>{{cite news |title=चंपानगर: नागपंचमी पर मनसा देवी मंदिर में श्रद्धालुओं ने की पूजा |url=https://www.livehindustan.com/bihar/bhagalpur/story-champanagar-devotees-worship-at-the-mansa-devi-temple-on-nagpanchami-3374975.html |access-date=22 July 2023 |work=Hindustan |date=25 July 2019 |language=hindi}}</ref> but these works are more known for the pious love of Behula and her husband Lakhander (Lakhindar or Lakshinder). This is the story of Bihula-Bishhari from Champa, the capital of [[Anga]], presently [[Champapuri]] in Bhagalpur district. However, this is not just a mythological story, the evidence of the metal house created by [[Vishvakarma]] on order of [[Chand Sadagar]] for Behula and her husband Lakhander to protect from Mansa is still been seen and reported when there is heavy rain in the region.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sunil |title=मां विषहरी पूजा: बिहुला विषहरी की गाथा का साक्षी है अंग का इतिहास |url=https://www.livehindustan.com/bihar/bhagalpur/story-history-of-angh-mother-vishahari-worship-and-bihula-is-a-witness-of-vishahari-worship-2693163.html |access-date=22 July 2023 |work=Hindustan |date=17 August 2019 |language=hi}}</ref>

Most of the visitors are said to be from the eastern parts of India and Bangladesh. There is a belief that the water in a pond here has medicinal qualities that can cure illness and snake bites.
