'''Derby''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-derby.ogg|ˈ|d|ɑr|b|i}} {{respell|DAR|bee}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]] on the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] in [[Derbyshire]], England. Derbyshire is named after Derby, which was its original [[county town]]. As a unitary authority, Derby is administratively independent from [[Derbyshire County Council]]. The population of Derby is {{English district population|GSS=E06000015}} ({{United Kingdom statistics year}}).<ref name=popstats />

The Romans established the town of [[Derventio Coritanorum|Derventio]], which was later captured by the Anglo-Saxons and then by the Vikings who made {{lang|non|Djúra-bý}} one of the [[Five Boroughs of the Danelaw]]. Initially a [[market town]], Derby grew rapidly in the industrial era and was home to [[Lombe's Mill]], an early British factory, Derby contains the southern part of the [[Derwent Valley Mills]] World Heritage Site. With the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Derby became a centre of the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|British rail industry]]. Despite having a [[Derby Cathedral|cathedral]] since 1927, Derby did not gain [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] until 1977.

Derby is a centre for advanced transport manufacturing. It is home to engine manufacturer [[Rolls-Royce Group PLC|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Alstom]] (formerly [[Bombardier Transportation]]) has a production facility at the [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works]]; [[Toyota Manufacturing UK|Toyota]]'s UK headquarters is located in the south-west of the city at [[Burnaston]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Derby}}

===Origins===
[[File:Derby Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The tower of [[Derby Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youandyesterday.co.uk/articles/Derby_Cathedral |title=Derby Cathedral |work=You & Yesterday |access-date=4 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512202845/http://www.youandyesterday.co.uk/articles/Derby_Cathedral |archive-date=12 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>]]
[[File:Derbyshire Cathedral.jpg|thumb|View of Derby Cathedral's facing clock tower]]

The Roman camp of [[Derventio (Little Chester)|Derventio]] is considered to have been at [[Little Chester]]/Chester Green ({{gbmapping|SK353375}}), the site of the old Roman fort. Later, the town was one of the "[[Five Burghs|Five Boroughs]]" (fortified towns) of the [[Danelaw]], until it was captured by [[Æthelflæd|Lady Æthelflæd of Mercia]] in July 917, after which the town was annexed to the Kingdom of Mercia.<ref>Walker, Ian W (2000). Mercia and the Making of England Sutton {{ISBN|0-7509-2131-5}}.</ref>

The [[Viking]] name {{lang|non|Djúra-bý}}, recorded in [[Old English language|Old English]] as {{lang|ang|Deoraby}}, means "village of the deer". However, the origin of the name Derby has had multiple influences: a variation of the original Roman name {{lang|la|Derventio}} with pronunciation of the letter "v" as "b", becoming {{lang|la|Derbentio}}, and later Derby, along with a link to the river Derwent – from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] meaning "valley thick with oaks"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ekwall |first=Eilert |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press| orig-year=1936 |year=1960 |page=143 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-19-869103-3}}</ref> – which flows through the city, triggering a shortened version of ''Derwent by'', meaning 'Derwent settlement'.

The town name appears as ''Darbye'' on early maps, such as that of [[John Speed]], 1610.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://prints.bl.uk/products/map-of-derbyshire-c13383-06 |title=Map of Derbyshire |website=British Library Prints |access-date=12 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413101827/https://prints.bl.uk/products/map-of-derbyshire-c13383-06 |archive-date=13 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Modern research (2004) into the history and [[archaeology]] of Derby has provided evidence that the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons would have co-existed, occupying two areas of land surrounded by water. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' (c. 900) says that "Derby is divided by water". These areas of land were known as {{lang|ang|Norþworþig}} ("Northworthy"="north enclosure") and {{lang|ang|Deoraby}}, and were at the "Irongate" (north) side of Derby.<ref>''The Rivers of Time'' Ron McKeown, {{ISBN|0-9530603-7-3}}</ref>

===16th–18th centuries===
During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] of 1642–1646, Derby was garrisoned by [[New Model Army|Parliamentary troops]] commanded by [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet]], who was appointed Governor of Derby in 1643. These troops took part in the defence of nearby [[Nottingham]], the siege of [[Lichfield]], the [[battle of Hopton Heath]] and many other engagements in [[Nottinghamshire]], Staffordshire and [[Cheshire]], as well as successfully defending Derbyshire against [[Royalist]] armies.

The first civic system of piped water in England was established in Derby in 1692, using wooden pipes,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of Home |first=Judith |last=Flanders |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-250-06735-7 |page=246}}</ref> which was common for several centuries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sewerhistory.org/photosgraphics/pipes-wood/ |title=The History of Sanitary Sewers - Pipes - Wood |access-date=15 April 2021 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415071857/http://www.sewerhistory.org/photosgraphics/pipes-wood/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Derby Waterworks included waterwheel-powered pumps for raising water out of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] and storage tanks for distribution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://engineering-timelines.com/who/Sorocold_G/sorocoldGeorge4.asp |title=George Sorocold – Derby Waterworks |access-date=15 April 2021 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415071857/http://engineering-timelines.com/who/Sorocold_G/sorocoldGeorge4.asp |url-status=live }}</ref> This was designed and built by local engineer [[George Sorocold]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/sorocold_G/sorocoldGeorge4.asp |title=George Sorocold |website=Engineering Timelines |access-date=19 November 2021 |archive-date=15 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210615195231/https://engineering-timelines.com/who/Sorocold_G/sorocoldGeorge4.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:bonniequest.jpg|thumb|Statue of Charles Edwart Stuart on Cathedral Green]]

During the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], [[Jacobite Army (1745)|Jacobite Army]] troops led by Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]] arrived in Derby on 4 December 1745, whilst on their way to [[London]] to attempt to overthrow the reigning [[House of Hanover]]. Stuart called at [[The Derbyshire Blues#The George Inn|The George Inn]] on Irongate (where the [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] had set up his headquarters in late November after raising [[The Derbyshire Blues]]) and demanded [[billet]]s for the 9,000 troops under his command. The prince stayed at [[Exeter House]] on Full Street, where he held a [[council of war]] on 5 December which decided to retreat. Stuart had received misleading information about a government army coming to meet him south of Derby. He abandoned his invasion at [[Swarkestone Bridge]] on the [[River Trent]], a few miles south of Derby. The prince, who on the march from Scotland had walked at the front of the column, made the return journey on horseback at the rear of the bedraggled and tired army.{{cn|date=August 2023}}

[[Medieval football|Shrovetide football]] was played at Derby every year, possibly from as early as the 12th century. The town was split into the [[St Peter's Church, Derby|St Peter's]] and [[Derby Cathedral|All Saints]] parishes, who fought to bring the ball from the Market Place to a goal within their own parishes.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Shrovetide Football – the original Derby Game |url=https://www.greatbritishlife.co.uk/shrovetide-football-the-original-derby-game-6504718 |first=Peter |last=Seddon |magazine=Derbyshire Life |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=2 April 2021 |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417050455/https://www.greatbritishlife.co.uk/shrovetide-football-the-original-derby-game-6504718 |url-status=live }}</ref> There were several attempts to ban the game, described in 1846 as "the barbarous and disgusting play of Foot-Ball, which for a great number of years has annually disgraced our town". In that year the military were brought in and after the police cut the first ball to pieces, another ball was produced and the town's Mayor was "stuck on the shoulder by a brick-bat, hurled by some ferocious ruffian, and severely bruised".<ref>''Derby Mercury'', 25 February 1846</ref> The Derby Football was banned in 1846, although it was played once more in 1870.<ref>''Derbyshire Advertiser'', 4 March 1870</ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
Derby and Derbyshire were among the centres of Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]]. In 1717, Derby was the site of the first [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] in Britain, built by [[John Lombe]] and [[George Sorocold]], after Lombe had reputedly stolen the secrets of [[Silk throwing|silk-throwing]] from [[Piedmont]] in Italy (he is alleged to have been poisoned by the Piedmontese as revenge in 1722).<ref>{{Cite web |title=How we became The Silk Town |url=https://macclesfieldmuseums.co.uk/how-we-became-the-silk-town |access-date=9 November 2021 |publisher=Macclesfield Museums |language=en-GB |archive-date=9 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211109165244/https://macclesfieldmuseums.co.uk/how-we-became-the-silk-town |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1759, [[Jedediah Strutt]] patented and built a machine called the Derby Rib Attachment<ref name="nationalarchives.gov.uk">{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/a6d33a63-890c-4631-8c8e-75a91c4830dd |title=W.G. and J.

This attachment was used on the Rev. Lee's [[Stocking frame|Framework Knitting]] Machine; it was placed in front of – and worked in unison with – Lee's Frame, to produce ribbed hose (stockings). The partners were Jedediah Strutt, William Woollatt (who had been joined in 1758 by John Bloodworth and Thomas Stafford, all leading [[hosier]]s in Derby). The patent was obtained in January 1759. After three years, Bloodworth and Stafford were paid off, and Samuel Need – a hosier of [[Nottingham]] – joined the partnership. The firm was known as Need, Strutt and Woollatt. The patent expired in 1773<ref name="nationalarchives.gov.uk"/> though the partnership continued until 1781 when Need died.

Messrs Wright, the bankers of Nottingham, recommended that [[Richard Arkwright]] apply to Strutt and Need for finance for his cotton [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] mill. The first mill opened in Nottingham in 1770 and was driven by horses. In 1771 Richard Arkwright, Samuel Need and Jedediah Strutt built the world's first commercially successful [[water-power]]ed cotton spinning mill at [[Cromford]], Derbyshire, developing a form of power that was to be a [[catalyst]] for the Industrial Revolution.<ref name="Cromford Mills">{{cite web |url=http://www.cromfordmill.co.uk |title=About Cromford Mill |access-date=26 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520133304/http://www.cromfordmill.co.uk/ |archive-date=20 May 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Eclectica">{{cite web |url=http://addiator.blogspot.com/2012/11/cromford-mills-birthplace-of-industrial.html |title=Cromford Mills – birthplace of the industrial revolution |access-date=26 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124183439/http://addiator.blogspot.com/2012/11/cromford-mills-birthplace-of-industrial.html |archive-date=24 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="1st water powered Cotton Spinning Mill in the World">{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaydeespix/6335688382 |title=The 1st water powered Cotton Spinning Mill in the World |date=4 November 2011 |access-date=26 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124183441/https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaydeespix/6335688382 |archive-date=24 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

This was followed in Derbyshire by Jedediah Strutt's cotton spinning mills at [[Belper]]. They were: South Mill, the first, 1775; North Mill, 1784, which was destroyed by fire on 12 January 1803 and then rebuilt, starting work again at the end of 1804; West Mill, 1792, commenced working 1796; Reeling Mill, 1897; Round Mill, which took 10 years to build, from 1803 to 1813, and commenced working in 1816; and Milford Mills, 1778. The Belper and [[Milford, Derbyshire|Milford]] mills were ''not'' built in partnership with Arkwright; they were all owned and financed by Strutt.

Other notable 18th-century figures with connections to Derby include the painter [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], known as Wright of Derby, who was known for his innovative use of light in his paintings and was an associate of the [[Royal Academy]]; and [[John Whitehurst]], a [[clockmaker]] and philosopher. [[Erasmus Darwin]], doctor, scientist, philosopher and grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], moved to Derby in 1782 and founded the [[Derby Philosophical Society]].

Derby's place in the country's philosophical and political life continued with Henry Hutchinson, an active member of the [[Fabian Society]]. On his death in 1894, he left the society an amount in his will which was instrumental in founding the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2015/09/30/funding-the-vision-henry-hunt-hutchinson-and-his-will/ |title=Henry Hunt Hutchinson and his will |first=Sue |last=Donnelly |website=LSE History |publisher=London School of Economics |date=30 September 2015 |access-date=25 May 2023 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629132340/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2015/09/30/funding-the-vision-henry-hunt-hutchinson-and-his-will/ |archive-date=29 June 2017}}</ref>

The beginning of 19th century saw Derby emerging as an engineering centre, with manufacturers such as [[James Fox (engineer)|James Fox]], who exported machine tools to Russia.

In 1840, the [[North Midland Railway]] set up [[Derby Works|its works in Derby]] and when it merged with the [[Midland Counties Railway]] and the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway]] to form the [[Midland Railway]], Derby became its headquarters. The connection with the railway encouraged others, notably [[Andrew Handyside and Company|Andrew Handyside]], [[Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)|Charles Fox]] and his son [[Francis Fox (engineer)|Francis Fox]]. <!-- CLUMSY, NEEDS REWRITING.....A list of the structures these three built reads like a ''"[[Who's Who]]"'' of famous buildings.-->

A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Normanton Barracks]] in 1877.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinfin-derby.co.uk/History.html |title=Nothing ever happens in Sinfin |publisher=This is Sinfin |access-date=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811094319/http://sinfin-derby.co.uk/History.html |archive-date=11 August 2013}}</ref>

Derby was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and it became a [[county borough]] with the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. The borough expanded in 1877 to include [[Little Chester]] and [[Litchurch]], and then in 1890 to include New Normanton and Rowditch. The borough did not increase substantially again until 1968, when under a recommendation of the Local Government Boundary Commission it was expanded into large parts of the rural district of [[Belper]], [[Repton Rural District|Repton]] and [[South East Derbyshire Rural District|South East Derbyshire]]. This vastly increased Derby's population from 132,408 in the 1961 census to 219,578 in the 1971 census.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10109700&c_id=10001043&add=N |title=Derby Derbyshire through time &#124; Population Statistics &#124; Total Population |access-date=6 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228232118/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10109700&c_id=10001043&add=N |archive-date=28 February 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite being one of the areas of Britain [[Centre points of the United Kingdom|furthest from the sea]], Derby holds a special place in the history of marine safety – it was as MP for Derby that [[Samuel Plimsoll]] introduced his bills for a "[[Plimsoll line]]" (and other marine safety measures). This failed on first introduction, but was successful in 1876 and contributed to Plimsoll's re-election as an MP.

===20th century to present day===
An industrial boom began in Derby when [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] opened a car and aircraft factory in the town in 1907. In 1923, the [[Midland Railway]] became part of the [[London, Midland & Scottish Railway]] with headquarters in London. However, Derby remained a major rail manufacturing centre, second only to [[Crewe Works|Crewe]] and [[Wolverton Works|Wolverton]]. Moreover, it remained a design and development centre and in the 1930s, on the direction of [[Josiah Stamp, 1st Baron Stamp|Lord Stamp]], the [[LMS Scientific Research Laboratory]] was opened on London Road.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1911, the Derby Wireless Club was formed by a group of local engineers and experimenters. It was to be the first radio or "wireless club" in the country.<ref>{{cite web |title=DADARS: Detailed History 1911 to 1961 |url=http://www.dadars.org.uk/history.htm |website=www.dadars.org.uk |publisher=Derby & District Amateur Radio Society |access-date=4 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305021901/http://www.dadars.org.uk/history.htm |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Derby Wireless Club |url=http://www.derbywirelessclub.org.uk/ |publisher=Derby Wireless Club |access-date=4 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205181149/http://www.derbywirelessclub.org.uk/ |archive-date=5 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The early activities of the club, (even through World Wars), pushed the boundaries of 'wireless' technologies at the time in England, and promoted it into becoming a hobby for many local folk.
{Over later years, as radio technology progressed, the club transitioned to become the Derby & District Amateur Radio Society (DADARS), continuing to host meetings and events for radio hobbyists with all the new technologies, into the early 2020s.}

In World War I, Derby was targeted by German [[Zeppelin]] air bombers, who killed five people in a 1916 raid on the town.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p022x67j |title=BBC – World War One At Home, Midland Railway Works, Derby: The Night Lights Were Left On |work=BBC |date=30 July 2014 |access-date=27 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720205850/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p022x67j |archive-date=20 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

All Saints Church was designated as a cathedral in 1927, signalling that the town was ready for city status.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facts and Statistics |url=http://www.derby.anglican.org/en/about-us/the-diocese/facts-and-statistics.html |website=www.derby.anglican.org |publisher=Diocese of Derby |access-date=4 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205100637/http://www.derby.anglican.org/en/about-us/the-diocese/facts-and-statistics.html |archive-date=5 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|Slum clearance]] in the 1920s and 1930s saw the central area of Derby become less heavily populated as families were rehoused on new [[Council housing|council estates]] in the suburbs, where houses for private sale were also constructed. Rehousing, council house building and private housing developments continued on a large scale for some 30 years after the end of World War II in 1945.<ref name="lambert">{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Lambert |url=http://www.localhistories.org/derby.html |title=A brief history of Derby, Derbyshire, England |work=The History of the World |access-date=11 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809015642/http://www.localhistories.org/derby.html |archive-date=9 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Production and repair work continued at the railway works. In December 1947 the [[Derby Works|Locomotive Works]] unveiled Britain's first mainline passenger [[Diesel locomotive|diesel-electric locomotive]] – [[British Rail Class D16/1|"Number 10000"]]. In 1958 production switched over to diesel locomotives completely. Meanwhile, the [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works|Carriage & Wagon Works]] were building the first of the [[Diesel Multiple Units]] that were to take over many of the services.

In 1964 the [[British Rail Research Division]] opened to study all aspects of railway engineering from first principles. Its first success was in drastically improving the reliability and speed of goods trains, work which led to the development of the [[Advanced Passenger Train]].

Derby was awarded city status on 7 June 1977 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to mark the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|25th anniversary of her ascension to the throne]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=47246|page=7656 |date=14 June 1977}}</ref> The Queen presented the "charter scroll" or "letters patent" in person on 28 July 1977 on the steps of the [[Council House, Derby|Council House]] to the then Mayor Councillor Jeffrey Tillet (Conservative).<ref>The Times. 29 July 1977</ref> Until then, Derby had been one of the few towns in England with a [[Derby_Cathedral|cathedral]] but not city status.

Derby holds an important position in the history of the [[Labour movement]] as one of two seats (the other being [[Keir Hardie]]'s in [[Merthyr Tydfil]]) gained by the recently formed [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee (1900–1906)|Labour Representation Committee]] at the 1900 general election. The MP was [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]], General Secretary of the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|Railway Servants Union]]. Bell was succeeded in 1910 by [[James Henry Thomas|Jimmy Thomas]] and he in turn by the distinguished [[polymath]] and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Philip Noel-Baker, Baron Noel-Baker|Philip Noel-Baker]] in 1936.

Despite its strategic industries (rail and [[aircraft engine|aero-engine]]), Derby suffered comparatively little damage in both [[world war]]s (contrast [[Bristol]] and [[Filton]]). This may in part have been because of jamming against the German radio-beam navigations systems (X-Verfahren and [[Knickebein]], camouflage and decoy techniques ("[[Starfish site]]s") were built, mainly south of the town, e.g. out in fields near [[Foremark]].<ref>Kirk, Felix & Bartnik, 2002</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youandyesterday.co.uk/articles/WWII:_How_film_sets_saved_Derby_at_war |title=Stories |publisher=Youandyesterday.co.uk |date=27 July 1942 |access-date=17 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130307/http://www.youandyesterday.co.uk/articles/WWII:_HOW_FILM_SETS_SAVED_DERBY_AT_WAR |archive-date=7 August 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>)

Derby has also become a significant [[cultural centre]] for the [[deaf community]] in Britain. Many deaf people move to Derby because of its strong [[sign language]]-using community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} It is estimated that the deaf population in Derby is at least three times higher than the national average, and that only London has a larger deaf population.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} The Royal School for the Deaf on Ashbourne Road provides education in [[British Sign Language]] and English.

The [[Office for National Statistics]] defines an [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|urban area]] as one which is built upon, with nearby areas linked if within 200 metres.<ref>{{cite web |title=ONS 2011 Built-up Areas – Methodology and Guidance |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/census/lookup/built-up-area-user-guidance.pdf |website=www.ons.gov.uk |access-date=26 July 2021 |archive-date=12 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220712015118/https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/census/lookup/built-up-area-user-guidance.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Census 2001: Key Statistics for urban areas in England and Wales |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales-part-1.pdf |website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales-part-1.pdf |archivedate=5 January 2016}}</ref> It had a total population of 270,468 at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]].<ref name="BUA">{{cite web |url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx |title=2011 Census – Built-up areas |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] |accessdate=3 July 2013 |archive-date=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921045319/http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> An increase of over 10% since the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] recorded population of 236,738;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&More=Y |title=Office for National Statistics: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas |access-date=26 July 2021 |archive-date=11 March 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311050212/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&More=Y |url-status=live }}</ref> comprising population increases since 2001 along with new minor residential areas, and larger sub-divisions.The Derby built-up area is considered to be most of the city, as well as outlying villages within the [[Districts of England|districts]] of [[Amber Valley]] and [[Borough of Erewash|Erewash]] which adjoin the city. This overall area is, by ONS' figures, the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom#Most populous|29th largest in the UK]].

Because methods of measuring linked areas were redefined for the 2011 census, [[Breadsall]], [[Duffield, Derbyshire|Duffield]] and [[Little Eaton]] were included. However, [[Quarndon]] is not considered to be a component as it is marginally too distant. It extends south to small adjoining estates in the [[South Derbyshire]] district, at [[Boulton, Derby#Boulton Moor|Boulton Moor]]/[[Thulston|Thulston Fields]], [[Stenson Fields]], and the Mickleover Country Park residential development (The Pastures)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://burnaston-online.co.uk/history.htm |title=History of Burnaston Parish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904214421/http://burnaston-online.co.uk/history.htm |archive-date=4 September 2018 |publisher=Burnaston Parish Council |access-date=11 October 2021}}</ref> within [[Burnaston]] parish. The urban area is bounded to the east by a narrow gap between [[Borrowash]] and [[Draycott, Derbyshire|Draycott]] (to the west of the [[Breaston]] urban area sub-division of the [[Nottingham Urban Area|Nottingham BUA]]). It is also close to other nearby urban areas to the north.

===Railway engineering===

[[File:IMechE dinner 1898 Derby.jpg|thumb|Annual dinner of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers held in the carriage works of the Midland Railway at Derby in 1898. Samuel Johnson, the railway's Chief Mechanical Engineer was the institution president.]]

As a consequence of the Midland Railway having their headquarters in Derby, along with their [[Derby Works|Locomotive]] and [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works|Carriage & Wagon Works]], the railways had been a major influence on the development of the town during the Victorian period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

During the 20th century, railway manufacturing developed elsewhere, while in Derby the emphasis shifted to other industries. Even though it had pioneered the introduction of diesel locomotives, new production finished in 1966.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Repair work gradually diminished until  the locomotive works closed, the land being redeveloped as Pride Park. The only buildings remaining are those visible from Platform 6 of the station.

The Carriage and Wagon Works has been owned by [[Alstom]] since 2021 and continues to build trains.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lodge |first1=Matthew |title=Bombardier in Derby gets new owners in £4.9 billion deal |url=https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/bombardier-derby-gets-new-owners-4944493 |newspaper=Derbyshirelive |date=29 January 2021 |access-date=3 August 2022}}</ref> The [[Railway Technical Centre]] continues to house railway businesses; this formerly included the headquarters of [[DeltaRail Group]] (previously known as the [[British Rail Research Division]]).

[[Derby railway station]] retains an important position in the railway network. [[East Midlands Railway]] operate [[Derby Etches Park]] depot while [[Network Rail]] and [[Rail Operations Group]] also maintain trains in Derby. On 21 March 2023, it was announced that the city was to be the headquarters of Great British Railways.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.marketingderby.co.uk/news/derby-named-as-new-headquarters-of-great-british-railways/ | title=Derby named as new headquarters of Great British Railways | date=21 March 2023 }}</ref>

Derby is also the headquarters of the [[Derby Railway Engineering Society]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dres.org.uk/ |title=Home page |publisher=Derby Railway Engineering Society |access-date=11 October 2021 |archive-date=24 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724100742/http://dres.org.uk/ |url-status=live }}</ref> founded in 1908 to promote railway engineering expertise both in the city and nationally.

[[File:Pickford expo.jpg|thumb|Pickford's House Museum]]
[[Pickford's House Museum]] was built by architect [[Joseph Pickford]] in 1770. It was his home and business headquarters. [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] shows paintings by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], as well as fine [[Royal Crown Derby]] porcelain, natural history, local regiments and archaeology. Pickford also designed [[St Helen's House, Derby|St Helen's House]] in King Street.

The skyline of the inner city changed in 1968 when the inner ring road with its two new crossings of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] was built. The route of the ring road went through the [[St Alkmund's Church, Derby|St Alkmund's Church]] and its [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[churchyard]], the only Georgian square in Derby. Both were demolished to make way for the road, a move still criticised today. Thus the editor (Elizabeth Williamson) of the 2nd edition of [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] for Derbyshire wrote: "...the character and cohesion of the centre has been completely altered by the replacement of a large number of C18 houses in the centre by a multi-lane road. As a traffic scheme this road is said to be a triumph; as townscape it is a disaster."

The station is also on a main inter-city route between locations in [[Scotland]], the [[North East England|North East]], the [[South West England|South West]] and [[South East England|South East]]; these include [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]], [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle]], [[York railway station|York]], [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]], Sheffield, Birmingham, [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]], [[Exeter St Davids|Exeter]] and [[Plymouth railway station|Plymouth]], [[Reading railway station|Reading]] and [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton]].<ref> {{Cite web |work=CrossCountry |title=Timetables |date=21 May 2023 |access-date=29 July 2023 |url= https://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/travel-updates-information/train-timetables |quote=}}</ref>

There are also local stations at [[Peartree railway station|Peartree]] (on the Newark to Crewe route) and [[Spondon railway station|Spondon]] (on the Nottingham to Matlock route), although their stopping services are very limited.

===Buses and coaches===
[[Derby bus station]] is the hub for local bus services in and around the city. Routes are operated by a number of companies, but principally [[Trent Barton]] and [[Arriva Midlands]]. Destinations include [[Belper]], [[Burton-upon-Trent]], [[Ilkeston, Derbyshire|Ilkeston]], [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] and [[Nottingham]].<ref name=BT>{{cite web |title=Stops in Derby |work=Bus Times |date=2023 |access-date=29 July 2023 |url= https://bustimes.org/localities/derby |quote=}}</ref>

The city is on several [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] routes; destinations include [[Birmingham]], [[Gatwick Airport]], [[Leicester]], [[Leeds]] and [[London]].<ref name=BT/>

===Roads===
[[File:Mercian_Way's_Junction_with_Abbey_Street.JPG|right|thumb|Mercian Way, looking across Abbey Street towards Uttoxeter New Road]]

The [[M1 motorway]] passes about {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of the city, linking Derby southwards to London and northwards to [[Sheffield]] and Leeds. Other major roads passing through or near Derby include the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] (historically the main route from London to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], also linking to Leicester and [[Manchester]]); [[A38 road (Great Britain)|A38]] ([[Bodmin]] to Mansfield, via [[Bristol]] and Birmingham); [[A50 road (Great Britain)|A50]] ([[Warrington]] to Leicester, via [[Stoke-on-Trent]]); [[A52 road (Great Britain)|A52]] ([[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] to [[Mablethorpe]], including [[Brian Clough]] Way linking Derby to Nottingham); and [[A61 road (Great Britain)|A61]] (Derby to [[Thirsk]], via Sheffield and Leeds).

On 16 March 2011, Mercian Way, the final section of the city's inner ring road, was opened to traffic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/Neville-test-drives-city-s-new-ring-road/article-3342031-detail/article.html |title=Neville test-drives city's new ring road |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911235607/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/Neville-test-drives-city-s-new-ring-road/article-3342031-detail/article.html |archive-date=11 September 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=17 March 2011}}</ref> This new section connects Burton Road with Uttoxeter New Road; it crosses Abbey Street, which is the only road between the two ends from which Mercian Way can be accessed.

===Air===
[[East Midlands Airport]] is located about {{convert|15|mi|km}} from Derby city centre. There was controversy concerning the airport's decision to prefix its name with ''Nottingham'' in 2004; this was due to its proximity to Derby, the fact that the airport is in [[Leicestershire]] and the traditional rivalry between its three nearby cities (Derby, Leicester and Nottingham).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Airport boosted after name change |work=BBC News |date=17 August 2004 |access-date=29 July 2023 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/3574106.stm |quote=}}</ref> In 2006, Nottingham East Midlands Airport reverted to its previous name.<ref>{{Cite web |title=It's back to East Midlands Airport |work=BBC News |date=8 December 2006 |access-date=29 July 2023 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2006/12/07/rename_nottingham_ema_feature.shtml |quote=}}</ref>

The lease was later bought by [[Derby University]] and the building was renamed [[Derby Theatre]]. Along with the Assembly Rooms and Guildhall Theatre, it was operated by Derby LIVE, the cultural arm of [[Derby City Council]]. In 2012 Derby University took over as sole operator of Derby Theatre; Sarah Brigham was appointed artistic director, and has been in post since January 2013.

==Sport==
[[File:Pride Park.jpg|thumb|right| [[Pride Park Stadium]]]]
Derby gained a high profile in sport following the appointment of [[Brian Clough]] as manager of [[Derby County F.C.]] in 1967. Promotion to the [[Football League First Division]] was achieved in 1969, and County were champions of the English league three years later. Following Clough's resignation in 1973, his successor [[Dave Mackay]] guided Derby County to another league title in 1975, but this remains to date the club's last major trophy; relegation followed in 1980 and top flight status was not regained until 1987, since when Derby have spent a total of 11 seasons (1987–1991, 1996–2002, 2007–2008) in the top flight.<ref name=dcfc>{{cite web |date=8 May 2011 |url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10270~2048716,00.html |title=The History of Derby County Football Club |publisher=Derby County Football Club |access-date=11 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228191905/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10270~2048716%2C00.html |archive-date=28 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other former managers of the club include [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]], [[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]], [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] and [[George Burley]].

==Shopping and nightlife==
[[File:Ye Olde Dolphin Inne, Queen Street, Derby - geograph.org.uk - 1097980.jpg|thumb|Ye Olde Dolphin Inne]]
Shopping in central Derby is divided into three main areas. These are the [[Cathedral Quarter, Derby|Cathedral Quarter]], the St Peters Quarter and the [[Derbion]] shopping centre. The Cathedral Quarter was Derby's first BID ([[Business Improvement District]]), and includes a large range of shops, boutiques, coffee shops and restaurants. It is focused around the cathedral and the area around Irongate and Sadler Gate. It includes the Market place, the Guildhall and Assembly Rooms along with the City Museum and the Silk Mill industrial museum.

The St Peters Quarter is Derby's second Business Improvement District, brought into effect in the summer of 2011. Its boundary with the Cathedral Quarter follows Victoria Street, beneath which flows the underground course of the [[Markeaton Brook]]. The quarter boasts a diverse range of retail shops, many of them, in Green Lane, Babington Lane, Osmaston Road and elsewhere, independent traders. St Peters Street, London Road and East Street also include a large choice of national retailers and pubs, restaurants, banks and offices. The quarter includes the historic [[St Peter's Church, Derby|St Peters Church]] and, on St Peter's Churchyard, the medieval [[Derby School]] building. Nearby also is the Old Courthouse (former County Court).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://her.derbyshire.gov.uk/Monument/MDR11455|title=Building record MDR11455 - The Old Court House, St Peter's Yard, Derby|publisher=Derbyshire Historic Environment Record|access-date=12 February 2023}}</ref>

[[Derbion]] is the city's main indoor shopping centre. It opened in 2007 as Westfield Derby after extension work costing £340&nbsp;million, subsequently being sold to [[Intu]] in March 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Robin |title=Westfield Derby shopping centre sold to Intu for £390m |work=Derby Evening Telegraph |date=20 March 2014 |url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Westfield-Derby-shopping-centre-sold-Intu-390m/story-20832006-detail/story.html |access-date=4 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202748/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Westfield-Derby-shopping-centre-sold-Intu-390m/story-20832006-detail/story.html |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It contains a food court and a 12-screen cinema ([[Showcase Cinemas|Showcase – Cinema De Lux]]) which was opened in May 2008. The development was controversial and local opponents accuse it of drawing trade away from the older parts of the city centre where independent shops are located. Some of these experienced a downturn in trade and some have ceased trading since the development opened leading to the "Lanes" project which eventually became the second BID and the formation of St Peters Quarter. In the centre itself, a combination of high rents and rising rates have made things difficult for smaller traders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westfieldderby.co.uk/about.htm |title=Westfield Derby – About |work=westfieldderby.co.uk |access-date=4 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410080636/http://www.westfieldderby.co.uk/about.htm |archive-date=10 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Friar Gate area contains clubs and bars, making it the centre of Derby's nightlife. Derby is also well provided with pubs and is renowned for its large number of [[real ale]] outlets. The oldest pub is the [[listed building|Grade II listed]] [[Ye Olde Dolphin Inne]], dating from the late 16th century.<ref name=EnglishHeritage>{{NHLE |num=1228932|desc=Ye Olde Dolphin Inne, Derby |access-date=18 August 2014}}</ref>

Out-of-town shopping areas include the Kingsway Retail Park, off the A38; the Wyvern Retail Park, near Pride Park; and the Meteor Centre, on Mansfield Road.

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Derby}}
Like most of the UK, Derby operates a non-selective primary and secondary education system with no [[middle school]]s. Pupils attend infant and junior school (often in a combined primary school) before moving onto a secondary school. Many of the secondary schools have [[sixth form]]s, allowing pupils to optionally take [[Advanced Level (UK)|A Levels]] after the end of compulsory education. For those who want to stay in education but leave school, the large [[Derby College]] provides post-16 courses for school leavers, apprentices and employer-related training. It has two main campuses: the [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright Centre]] in the centre of Derby, where its [[A Level]] courses are based, and the historical [[Derby Railway Works|Derby Roundhouse]], the college's vocational training hub, providing a centre for apprenticeships such as engineering, catering and hair and beauty. The college also works in partnership with schools across the county to provide vocational training opportunities for students aged 14 upwards. Training for companies is undertaken through its Corporate College.

Inside the state sector, there are 15 secondary schools. These are: [[Allestree Woodlands School]], [[Alvaston Moor Academy]], [[Bemrose School]], [[Chellaston Academy]], [[City of Derby Academy]], [[Da Vinci Academy]], [[Derby Manufacturing UTC]], [[Derby Moor Academy]], [[Derby Pride Academy]], [[Landau Forte College]], [[Lees Brook Community School]], [[Littleover Community School]], [[Merrill Academy]], [[Murray Park School]], [[Noel-Baker Academy]], [[Saint Benedict Catholic Voluntary Academy]] and [[West Park School]].

They aim to continue the work and traditions of the former [[Derby School]], which closed in 1989, one of the oldest schools in England.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Derby High School, Derby|Derby High School]] was girls-only for senior and sixth form and for girls and boys at primary level until 2019 where boys were accepted into Year 7 and Year 12.<ref>{{cite web |title=About DHS |url=https://derbyhigh.derby.sch.uk/about-dhs/#:~:text=Our%20Primary%20School%20teaches%20both,fully%20coeducational%20throughout%20the%20school. |publisher=Derby High School |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref> As of 2023, the school is now fully co-educational, accepting both boys and girls in all years of school.

Derby has [[special needs]] establishments including Ivy House School at the Derby Moor Community Sports College (which takes pupils from nursery to sixth form) and the Light House which is a [[respite care|respite]] facility for children and parents.

The partnership treaty between the two cities was signed on 17 February 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/tourism-and-travel/town-twinning/#DerbyOsna_twinned_37_yrs |title=Town twinning |publisher=Derby City Council |access-date=20 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803111518/http://www.derby.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/tourism-and-travel/town-twinning/#DerbyOsna_twinned_37_yrs |archive-date=3 August 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The twinning agreement with Derby was in the historical Hall of Peace in Osnabrück's Rathaus (town hall).
Every year, Derby and Osnabrück each appoint an envoy who spends twelve months in the twin city. The envoy promotes the exchange of ideas between the two cities and acts as an educational and information officer to increase awareness of the twinning scheme. The envoy gives talks to local societies and schools, finds [[pen friend]]s and short-term host families during work placements, works to assist groups who want to get involved in twinning by identifying and approaching possible counterparts and plans the annual May Week trip.

There is an annual exchange between the wind bands of [[John Port Spencer Academy]], Etwall, and its twin school Gymnasium Melle in [[Melle, Germany|Melle]], Germany, [[Districts of Germany|District]] of [[Osnabrücker Land]].
An exchange was established in 2009 between [[Allestree Woodlands School]] and the Gymnasium [[Angelaschule]] in Osnabrück.
This exchange was originally based on a drama project by both schools in June 2009, which included performances in both cities with over 1600 visitors. It is now a language and culture exchange between the two schools, run by the German department at Allestree Woodlands School.

The exchange of envoys between two cities is very unusual. The envoy in Osnabrück changes every year and Osnabrück also sends envoys to Derby, [[Angers]] and [[Çanakkale]]. No other city in Germany participates in this exchange of envoys, and in Britain, only one other town, [[Wigan]], receives and sends an envoy.
