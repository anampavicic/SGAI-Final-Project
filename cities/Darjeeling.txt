'''Darjeeling''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɑːr|ˈ|dʒ|iː|l|ɪ|ŋ}},<ref name=oed-darj-pronunciation>{{Cite OED|Darjeeling|id=47293|access-date=17 August 2022|quote=Pronunciation: Brit. Eng. /dɑːˈdʒiːlɪŋ/, U.S. Eng /dɑrˈdʒilɪŋ/}}</ref> {{IPA-ne|ˈdard͡ziliŋ|lang}}, {{IPA|bn|ˈdarˌdʒiliŋ|lang}}) is a city in the northernmost region of the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[West Bengal]]. Located in the [[Eastern Himalayas]], it has an average elevation of {{Convert|6709|ft|order=flip}}.{{Sfn|Rahamtulla|Roy|Khasim|2020|p=157}} To the west of Darjeeling lies the [[Koshi Province|easternmost province]] of [[Nepal]], to the east the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]], to the north the Indian state of [[Sikkim]], and farther north the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] region of [[China]]. [[Bangladesh]] lies to the south and southeast, and most of the state of West Bengal lies to the south and southwest, connected to the Darjeeling region by a narrow [[Siliguri Corridor|tract]]. [[Kangchenjunga]], the world's third-highest mountain, rises to the north and is prominently visible on clear days.{{efn|"mist-enshrouded for half the year, on clear days the skyline is climaxed by the magnificent peak of Kangchenjunga".{{Sfn|Spate|Learmonth|2017|p=476}}}}{{Sfn|Bernbaum|2022|p=32}}

In the early 19th century, during [[Company rule in India|East India Company rule]] in India, Darjeeling was identified as a potential summer retreat for British officials, soldiers and their families. The narrow mountain ridge was leased from the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]], and eventually annexed to [[British India]]. Experimentation with growing tea on the slopes below Darjeeling was highly successful. Thousands of labourers were recruited chiefly from Nepal to clear the forests, build European-style cottages and work in the [[tea garden|tea plantation]]s. The widespread deforestation displaced the indigenous peoples. Residential schools were established in and around Darjeeling for the education of children of the [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] British in India. By the late-19th century, a novel narrow-gauge mountain railway, the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]], was bringing summer residents into the town and carrying a freight of tea out for export to the world. After India's independence in 1947, as the British left Darjeeling, its cottages were purchased by wealthy Indians from the plains and its tea plantations by out-of-town Indian business owners and conglomerates.

Darjeeling's population today is constituted largely of the descendants of the indigenous and immigrant labourers that were employed in the original development of the town. Although their [[lingua franca|common language]], the [[Nepali language]], has been given official recognition at the state and federal levels in India, the recognition has created little meaningful employment for the language's speakers nor has it increased their ability to have a significantly greater say in their political affairs. The tea industry and tourism are the mainstays of the town's economy. Deforestation in the region after India's independence has caused environmental damage, affecting the perennial springs that supply the town's water. The population of Darjeeling meanwhile has exploded over the years, and unregulated construction, traffic congestion and water shortages are common. Many young locals, educated in government schools, have taken to migrating out for the lack of jobs matching their skills. Like out-migrants from other regions of northeastern India, they have been subjected to [[Ethnic relations in India#Racism against North-East Indians in other states of India|discrimination]] and racism in some Indian cities.

Darjeeling's culture is highly cosmopolitan—a result of diverse ethnic groups intermixing and evolving away from their historical roots. The region's indigenous cuisine is rich in fermented foods and beverages. Tourists have flocked to Darjeeling since the mid-19th century. In 1999, after an international campaign for its support, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. In 2005, [[Darjeeling tea]] was given [[geographical indication]] by the [[World Trade Organization]] as much for the protection of the brand as for the development of the region that produces it.

==Toponymy==
At the time of the first British arrival, Darjeeling was known among its [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] inhabitants as {{transliteration|lep|Dorje-ling}}, or the "Place of the [[Thunderbolt]]."{{efn|"Stories of Darjeeling's colonial founding are by now legion. In 1829, Captain George Lloyd and J.W. Grant were passing through Darjeeling en route to settle a border dispute between Sikkim and Nepal. The location was then known by local Lepcha peoples as Dorje-ling, or "Place of the Thunderbolt".{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=5}}}} According to the ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names'', Darjeeling is derived from the [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] {{transliteration|bo|Dorje ling}} or {{transliteration|bo|Dorje-glin}}, meaning "Land of Dorje," i.e. of the [[vajra]], the weapon of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Indra]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Everett-Heath |first=John |chapter=Darjeeling |title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}</ref>

Darjeeling lies between the [[Mechi river|Mechi]] and [[Teesta river|Teesta]] rivers in the Eastern Himalayas. In the 18th century, it was part of a boundary region that had stirred ambitions and insecurities in several [[South Asia]]n states.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=5}} For the greater part of the century, the [[Chogyal]]-ruler of the northern [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] had asserted possession of this territory.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=5}} In the closing decades, the [[Gurkha kingdom]] of Nepal expanded eastwards to bring Darjeeling into its territory.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=5}} Its army stopped short of the Teesta, beyond which at the time lay the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]].{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=5}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dozey |first=E.

The English [[East India Company]] began to show an interest in the Darjeeling hills in the early 19th century.{{Sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=47}} At the time Darjeeling's indigenous population largely consisted of the [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] peoples.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}} The Company's interference in territorial matters began in the aftermath of its army's victory over the Gurkhas in the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]]. Fought between 1814 and 1816, the war concluded with two treaties, the [[Treaty of Sugauli]] and the [[Treaty of Titalia]], under which Nepal was required to return the Darjeeling territory to Sikkim.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=5}}

In 1829, two East India Company officials, Captain George Lloyd and J. W. Grant, en route to resolving a boundary dispute between Nepal and Sikkim, passed a [[crescent]]-shaped [[mountain ridge]] which they fancied excellent for a [[sanitorium]] for the British, or a resort for sheltering and recuperating from the heat of India's plains.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=5}}{{Sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=50}}{{Sfn|Lamb|1986|p=69}} [[Lord William Bentinck]], the [[Governor-General of India]], to whom Lloyd communicated his notion, concurred, recommending a small presence of the army in addition for monitoring the frontier.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}}

===1835–1857: East India Company rule===
Taking the ambition forward, in 1835 the East India Company negotiated the lease of a {{Convert|24|x|6|miles|km|order=flip|sigfig=1}} strip of land in a [[grant deed]] from the Chogyal.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}}{{Sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=47–48}} By the end of 1838, sappers from the army were readied for clearing the woods and construction planned in earnest after the [[monsoon rains]].{{Sfn|Pradhan|2017|p=118}} The following year, [[Archibald Campbell (doctor)|Archibald Campbell]], a physician, was made "superintendent" of Darjeeling, and two public buildings, a hotel and a courthouse were raised.{{Sfn|Pradhan|2017|p=118}} Soon, work had begun on [[bungalow]]s that conformed to British tastes.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}}

Turning Darjeeling into a resort required many more workers than were available in the scattered local populations.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}}{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|pp=85–86}} The British attracted workers from the neighbouring kingdoms, chiefly from Nepal but also from Sikkim and Bhutan. They did so by offering regular wages and [[lodging]]s, a contrast to the burdensome tax and [[forced labour]] regimens common in those kingdoms at the time.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}}{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|pp=85–86}} Tens of thousands arrived in Darjeeling.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}}{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|pp=85–86}} Not long after the Darjeeling Hill Cart Road was built in Northern Bengal, connecting [[Siliguri]] at the base of the Himalayan foothills to Darjeeling.{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2022|p=287}}

In 1833 the East India Company lost its monopoly rights in the [[tea]] trade with China.{{Sfn|Pradhan|2017|pp=118–119}} A plan was prepared for growing tea in India.{{Sfn|Pradhan|2017|pp=118–119}} Superintendent Campbell began experimentation in 1840 in Darjeeling which soon proved successful.{{Sfn|Pradhan|2017|pp=118–119}} European planters and sponsors acquired large stretches of the surrounding hillside and converted them to plantations, called ''[[tea garden]]s''.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=8}} Existing tracks and paths in the hills were improved, renamed as roads, and connected to the Hill Cart Road. The botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], who visited Darjeeling in the 1840s, noted that carts and pack animals on these roads were bringing fruit and produce from Nepal, wool and salt from Tibet, and labourers looking for work from just about everywhere.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sharma |first=Jayeeta |chapter=Himalayan Darjeeling and Mountain Histories of Labour and Mobility |pages=80–81 |editor1-last=Middleton |editor1-first=Townsend |editor2-last=Shneiderman |editor2-first=Sara |title=Darjeeling Reconsidered: Histories, Politics, Environments |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-19-948355-6}}</ref>

The labour migrations created a burgeoning hostility between the East India Company and the neighbouring Himalayan kingdoms.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}} By 1849 the hostility came to a head. Campbell and Hooker were allegedly kidnapped.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}} Despite the two being released without harm, the British exploited the incident to annex some {{Convert|640|mi2|km2|order=flip}} of territory between the Mechi and the Teesta rivers from Sikkim.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=6}}{{Sfn|Dasgupta|1999|pp=47–48}}

Darjeeling became a municipality in 1850.{{Sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}} In the span of 15 years, this Himalayan tract had become a ''[[hill station]]'', an official retreat for British administrators in a hilly, temperate, region of India.{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2022|pp=319–320}} Hill stations, such as [[Simla]] (summer capital of the British Indian Empire), [[Ooty]] (summer capital of the [[Madras Presidency]]), and [[Nainital]] (summer capital of the [[North-Western Provinces]]) were all established between 1819 and the 1840s, a period during which the rule of the East India Company had spread to the greater part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the British felt confident about planning them.{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2022|pp=319–320}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gilmour |first=David |title=The Ruling Caste: Imperial Lives in the Victorian Raj |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0-374-28354-4 |lccn=2005044679 |year=2006 |page=223}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Philip |first=Kavita |title=Civilizing Natures: Race, Resources, and Modernity in Colonial South India |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8135-3360-0 |page=29}}</ref> Darjeeling later became the summer capital of the [[Bengal Presidency]].{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2022|pp=325–326}}

===1858–1947: British Raj===
From 1850 to 1870 the tea industry in Darjeeling grew to 56 tea gardens employing some 8,000 labourers.{{Sfn | Middleton | Shneiderman | 2018 | p=8}} The tea gardens' security forces kept a close watch on the labourers and used coercion when necessary to maintain intensive production. The labourers' disparate cultural and ethnic backgrounds and the tea gardens' commonly remote locations ensured the absence of worker mobilization.{{Sfn|Zivkovic|2014|p=9}} By the turn of the 20th century, 100 tea gardens employed an estimated 64,000 workers,{{Sfn | Middleton | Shneiderman | 2018 | p=8}} and more than five million [[pound sterling]] were invested in Darjeeling tea.{{Sfn | Zivkovic | 2014 | p=9}} The widespread deforestation caused by the tea industry drastically changed the lives of the region's forest dwellers, who were either forced to relocate to other forests or become employed in their former habitat in new colonial occupations.{{Sfn|Pradhan|2017|p=125}} To the mix of the forest dwellers recruited, more labourers joined from across the Himalayas.{{Sfn | Shneiderman | Middleton | 2018 | p=8}} They communicated with each other in the [[Nepali language]].{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=8}} Later the language, and their customs and traditions would create the distinctive ethnicity of Darjeeling, called [[Indian Gorkha]].{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=8}}

Education became another aspect of Darjeeling's notability by the turn of the 20th century.

In 1945, as the [[British Raj]] was drawing towards a close, the Nepalese-speaking Indian Gorkha residents of Darjeeling had not been granted rights as British Indian subjects.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=9}} These residents were at the bottom of the economic ladder, and their physical appearance was now the occasional object of racism by Indians from the plains.

Darjeeling had a sizeable community of [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]], an ethnic group, originally from eastern Tibet whose ancestors had moved to some villages in [[Nepal]] below [[Mount Everest]]. Sherpas had come to Darjeeling in the second half of the 19th century as seasonal labourers looking for work in road-building.{{Sfn|Ortner|2020|p=30}} As mountaineering in the Himalayas had gained popularity and Nepal was closed to foreigners, many Western mountaineers and enthusiasts came to Darjeeling to plan their Himalayan expeditions.{{Sfn|Ortner|2020|p=30}} The Sherpas stood out for their exceptional physical ability as porters. These physical abilities and their fitness elicited visits to Darjeeling by European biochemists in the early 1900s.{{Sfn|Ortner|2020|p=31}} Among the most famous Sherpas who moved to Darjeeling were [[Ang Tharkay]]{{Sfn|Ortner|2020|p=71}} and [[Tenzing Norgay]].{{Sfn|Ortner|2020|p=73}} On 29 May 1953, Tenzing and [[Edmund Hillary]] became the first two humans to stand atop Mount Everest, vaulting both to instant stardom worldwide.

A trickle of immigrants from Tibet poured into Darjeeling which had begun in the second half of the 19th century.{{Sfn|Grunfeld|2015|p=190}} Wealthy Tibetan aristocrats had sent their children to Darjeeling's schools, and some went on to settle in the Darjeeling area.{{Sfn|Grunfeld|2015|p=190}} After the [[annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China]] in 1950–1951, many Tibetans emigrated to India, with some settling in the Darjeeling area, including the [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s older brother [[Gyalo Thondup]].{{Sfn|Goldstein|2019|p=18}} After the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the Dalai Lama himself fled to exile in India, and tens of thousands of Tibetan refugees poured in after him, with many finding refuge in the Darjeeling–[[Kalimpong]] area.{{Sfn|Grunfeld|2015|pp=190–192}} A [[Tibetan Refugee Self Help Centre]] was established in Darjeeling in 1959.{{Sfn | Sarker | 2017 | p=94}}

In May 1975, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] to the north of Darjeeling was absorbed into the Republic of India through a referendum. A month thereafter, Sikkim, in which nearly two-thirds of the populace spoke Nepali, was made a state of India.{{Sfn | Dasgupta | 1999 | p = 62 }} It was not lost on the Gorkhas of the Darjeeling region that there were many more speakers of Nepali in the Gorkha districts of northern Bengal, and their calls for autonomy had borne no fruit.{{Sfn | Dasgupta | 1999 | p = 62 }} The Government of India, moreover, had been reluctant to recognise Nepali as an official language in the [[Constitution of India]].{{Sfn | Dasgupta | 1999 | p = 62 }} Slights delivered by senior Indian leadership around this issue&mdash;[[Morarji Desai]], a former prime minister calling Nepali a foreign language, and [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], a former deputy prime minister, describing the Gorkhas as disloyal and entertaining "Mongoloid prejudices"&mdash;were all remembered.{{Sfn | Dasgupta | 1999 | pp = 62&ndash;63 }} A decade later, during [[Rajiv Gandhi]]'s prime ministership, small regions in Assam to the east of Darjeeling, which had been riven by violent ethnic separatism, were granted statehood.{{Sfn | Dasgupta | 1999 | pp = 62&ndash;63 }} All these factors played into creating a militant mood among the Gorkhas for statehood and brought the [[Gorkhaland movement]] to the forefront.{{Sfn | Dasgupta | 1999 | pp = 62&ndash;63 }} It led to the founding of the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF) under the leadership of [[Subhas Ghising]].{{Sfn | Dasgupta | 1999 | pp = 62&ndash;63 }} Agitation for a separate state in Darjeeling included violent protests,{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|pp=89–90}} and fighting between the disparate militant groups.{{Sfn|Zurick|Pacheco|2006|p=96}} The agitation ceased after an agreement was reached between the government and the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF). It resulted in the establishment of an elected body in 1988, the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]] (DGHC), which received some autonomy to govern the district.{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|pp=89–90}}

In 1992, the Nepali language was recognized officially at the federal level in India by inclusion in the [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]].{{Sfn|Gellner|2014|pp= 138–140|ps=. "Nepali [...] was accepted as the teaching language for all primary schools with a Nepali majority in Darjeeling district in 1935, as a national literary language in 1973 and as a national language of India by inclusion in Schedule Eight of the Constitution in 1992."}} Though Darjeeling became peaceful, the issue of a separate state lingered.{{Sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=65}} Agitation for a new state again erupted in 2008, led by the [[Gorkha Janmukti Morcha]] (GJM).{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|pp=94–95}} In July 2011, a pact was signed between GJM, the state and national governments which included an elected [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]] (GTA), with limited autonomy within the state of West Bengal. It evoked little enthusiasm on the streets.{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|p=96}} In 2013, fresh agitation broke out in Darjeeling after [[Telangana]], a region in southern India was granted statehood.{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|p=96}} Four years later, more agitation caused several months of violence, food shortages, and strikes in Darjeeling but resulted in the Morcha splitting into factions.{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|p=96}} In 2017, [[Mamata Banerjee]], the West Bengal chief minister, appointed a moderate Morcha politician to leadership in a reconstituted GTA, marginalizing and eventually ousting the founder of the movement, [[Bimal Gurung]].{{Sfn|Middleton|2021|pp=96–97}}

From the beginning of the twentieth century, Darjeeling's average temperature has increased by 4&nbsp;°C, which is twice the world's average,{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=165}} and the annual averages of its daily maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by greater margins.{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=165}}  During the same period, relative humidity has decreased by 7%,{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=165}}  and rainfall by {{Convert|300|mm|ft}} annually.{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=165}} For its water the Darjeeling municipality and the surrounding hills depend to a large extent on perennial or seasonal ''jhora'' [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]s (see [[:File:Map of Darjeeling Municipality, Darjeeling District, West Bengal India.jpg|Map&nbsp;1]]), especially during the pre-monsoon months from February to May.{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=162}}  The [[Senchal Lake]]s, two artificial reservoirs built in 1910 and 1932 in a forested high-altitude area to the southeast (see [[:File:Map of Senchal Lakes, the water supply source in relation to Darjeeling.jpg|Map&nbsp;2]]),{{Sfn|Mondal|Roychowdhury|2018|p=372}} which are filled with water from a surrounding catchment area during the monsoon months, have a greatly reduced supply, as of 2016.{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=163}}  Darjeeling's explosive population growth in the period 1961&ndash;2011, and extensive deforestation even within the protected catchment area for the lakes, have caused many springs to have vastly reduced yields during the dry months from February to May. Of the 26 springs that had once fed the lakes, 12 have been affected.{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=162}} Forests and pastures have shrunk from 78% in 1900 to 38% in 2000, and cultivated land, which contributes to soil erosion, has correspondingly increased during the same time from 20% to 44%.{{Sfn|Basumajumdar|2016|p=164}} By 2006, land records in Darjeeling showed that foodgrain-producing farmland had decreased proportionally, caused by accelerated levels of urbanisation and by subsistence farming giving way to commercial cropping, especially of tea.{{Sfn|Zurick|Pacheco|2006|p=108}}  In 2016, [[acid rain]], which can be caused by air pollution and can in turn damage forests, was observed in the Eastern Himalayas; the [[pH|pH value]] in Darjeeling was measured at 4.2.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Saikawa |first1=Eric |last2=Panday |first2=Arnico |last3=Kang |first3=Shichang |chapter=Air Pollution in the Hindu Kush Himalya |title=The Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment: Mountains, Climate Change, Sustainability and People |date=25 January 2019 |editor1-last=Wester |editor1-first=Philippus |editor2-last=Mishra |editor2-first=Arabinda |editor3-last=Mukherji |editor3-first=Aditi |editor4-last=Shrestha |editor4-first=Arun Bhakta |publisher=Springer Nature |isbn=978-3-319-92287-4 |page=366}}</ref> A 2022  article quoting another 2016 study reported a pH value of 5.0±0.825 in the rainwater.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Chemometric approach to evaluate the chemical behavior of rainwater at high altitude in Shaune Garang catchment, Western Himalaya |last1=Kumar |first1=Ramesh |last2=Kumar |first2=Rajesh |last3=Singh |first3=Atar |last4=Arif |first4=M Mohammad |last5=Kumar |first5=Pankaj |last6=Kumari |first6=Anupma |journal=Scientific Reports |year=2022 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=122774&ndash;122817; 122777 |doi=10.1038/s41598-022-15422-0 |pmid=35896609 |pmc=9329433|bibcode=2022NatSR..1212774K }}</ref>

According to a 2014 study, the influx of the excess population in the tea plantations around Darjeeling into "marginal areas of town—on backfill, slopes, septic tanks, and jhorās (springs)—has strapped the town’s colonial-era infrastructure. Despite building codes that prohibit buildings taller than three stories, the market for cheap housing in Darjeeling inspires developers to go skyward, often as many as eight stories. Hastily built apartment houses ... are falling into the jhorās and sliding down the mountainside."{{Sfn|Besky|2014|p=84}}

Darjeeling began to be an "administrative" town in independent India after being made the headquarters of [[Darjeeling district]] in 1947.{{Sfn|Mondal|Roychowdhury|2018|p=367}}  During the period 1961–2011, the town's population increased at an accelerated rate (Figure&nbsp;1).{{Sfn|Mondal|Roychowdhury|2018|p=367}} An "aspirational middle class" arose, comprising families of professionals in the administration, and retail and service industries.{{Sfn|Mondal|Roychowdhury|2018|p=367}}

"[[Indian Gorkha]]" is a term that denotes the Nepali-speaking people of India, as distinct from the Nepali-speaking inhabitants of Nepal.{{Sfn | Middleton | Shneiderman | 2018 | loc=pp. 158–159: "Early Nepali literary stalwarts like Parasmani Pradhan used both the terms ''Nepali'' and ''Gorkha'' interchangeably... Thus early associations of the Nepalis in India... used the word "Gorkha" to denote Nepalis of Indian origin"}}  As of 2016, the population of Darjeeling was predominantly Indian Gorkha. There were also smaller numbers of [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]]s, [[Bhutia]]s, [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s, [[Bengali people|Bengali]]s, [[Marwari people|Marwaris]] and [[Biharis]].{{Sfn|Lama|Rai|2016|p=90}}  In the 2011 census,<ref name="Mandal 2022"/> between them they practised [[Hinduism]] (66.5%), [[Buddhism]] (23.9%), [[Christianity]] (5.1%) and [[Islam]] (3.9%).{{Sfn|Mondal|Roychowdhury|2018|p=368}}  The Lepchas were considered the main indigenous community of the region; their original religion was a form of animism.{{Sfn|Lama|Rai|2016|p=90}} The Nepali community was a complex mix of numerous castes and ethnic groups, with many roots in tribal and animist traditions.{{Sfn|Lama|Rai|2016|p=90}} The accelerated growth of the town's population and the tightly packed living conditions in which different ethnicities mixed created syncretic cultures in Darjeeling which evolved away from their historical roots.{{Sfn|Lama|Rai|2016|p=90}}

According to a 2014 study, although the demand for labour in the tea estates surrounding Darjeeling had stayed roughly constant since 1910, the population of Nepali-speaking workers and their families in the tea estates had grown throughout.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|p=84}}  As the excess population migrated up to Darjeeling in search of jobs and housing, their cause was championed by the Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s; this had the effect of making a considerable number of non-Gorkha families leave their homes in Darjeeling.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|p=84}}

Seasonal migration out of Darjeeling has long been a local feature, especially among the lower-income groups; substantial migration among middle-class youth is a 21st-century occurrence.{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|p=535}} Many educated young people in Darjeeling have begun to migrate out because the growth of jobs in the area has not kept pace with the numbers of people with [[tertiary education|tertiary degrees]].{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|p=535}} For both groups of migrants, favoured destinations fall into three groups: 
*neighbouring [[Gangtok]] in [[Sikkim]], and [[Siliguri]] in [[North Bengal]] at the base of the Darjeeling hills;
*the large bustling cities of [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Bangalore]], and [[Mumbai]]; and
*[[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal.{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|pp=535–536}} Those looking for immediate employment commonly work in call centres, beauty parlours, and dumpling stands.{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|pp=535–536}}

Those looking for eventual employment in professional careers pursue higher education.{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|pp=535–536}} Both groups have experienced racism and economic and social discrimination in India's big cities, caused by their distinctive, more East Asian, physical appearance.{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|pp=535–538}}

The Darjeeling Municipality is one of the oldest in India, established on 1 July 1850, with ten [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]]s.{{Sfn|Chhetri|Lepcha|2021|p=319}} It was governed by commissioners who were nominated until 1916, then elected until 1932, and nominated again until 1947.{{Sfn|Chhetri|Lepcha|2021|p=319}}  After India's independence that year, the commissioners continued to be appointed until 1964, when the first election was held.  It was overturned by a court injunction; further elections and continual interference by West Bengal's state government became the prevalent state of affairs.{{Sfn|Chhetri|Lepcha|2021|p=319}}  As of 2021, the municipality is governed by a board of councillors headed by a [[chairperson]] and a [[Chairperson#Vice-chairperson|vice chairperson]].

A 2017 study described the Darjeeling area as entirely dependent on the production of tea and the inflow of tourists to create employment.{{Sfn|Taylor|Taylor|2017|p=96}}

{{further|Darjeeling tea}}
Darjeeling tea is produced on plantations in which a few leaves{{efn|the fabled, "two leaves and a bud"}} on each [[Camellia sinensis|tea bush]] are plucked by women. During the tea bush's [[Dormancy#Plants|dormancy]] period in the short winter season, it is [[pruning|pruned]] by the women to stimulate growth the following season.  Unlike China, where the tea bush grew into a tree, the early British planters devised these means to [[monocropping|monocrop]] tea in tightly packed hedges on vast estates. In the plantation factories, men operate machines to [[fermentation|ferment]], dry, and package the normally short-lived green tea leaves.{{Sfn|Besky|2020|p=6}}

After India's independence in 1947, many of Darjeeling's governmental and economic arrangements remained unchanged.  When British planters auctioned off their estates, they were bought by Indians from the plains or corporations from elsewhere in India.{{Sfn|Shneiderman|Middleton|2018|p=10}} Darjeeling's labour force had long consisted of workers recruited from Nepal.  Mid-19th-century British [[ethnology|ethnologists]] had commended Nepalese for their step farming and other forms of settled agriculture in the Himalayan foothills. They were contrasted with Darjeeling's native population of the Lepcha at the time of British annexation,{{Sfn|Booth|2009|p=10|ps=. "Workers were needed to meet the increasing demands for Darjeeling tea, and Nepalis were considered more suitable for tea cultivation than local groups such as the Lepcha. By British estimations, Nepali people had been farming on hill terraces in the Kathmandu Valley for thousands of years, and so the cultural practices and technical skills necessary to work in tea plantations were already ingrained and would not need to be taught."}} who practised "shifting agriculture".{{Sfn|Besky|2017|p=624}} Planters believed that if allotted a house and a yard in which to grow vegetables and fruit, the Nepalis would be more inclined to stay.{{Sfn|Besky|2017|p=624}} The arrangement, which lasted during the colonial period, was formalized in independent India's Plantations Labour Act, 1951.  As of 2017, workers maintain their two or three-bedroom homes which they do not own, become attached to their upkeep, and eventually hope to retire in them when an adult child who also works on the plantation inherits the house.{{Sfn|Besky|2017|p=624}}

In 2017, the average basic daily wage (that is, without [[employee benefit]]s) of a Darjeeling tea garden worker was [[Rupee]]s 144.60 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|144.6|USD|2017}}) per day.{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=56}}  With benefits, it was Rupees 277.10 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|277.10|USD|2017}}) per day.{{efn|The employee benefits for Darjeeling included Rs 14.20  ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|14.60|USD|2017}}) per day for foodgrains; Rupees 5.20 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|5.20|USD|2017}} in 2017) per day for dry tea, and Rupees 5.55 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|5.55|USD|2017}}) for fuel (for cooking or heating).{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=56}}}}{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=56}}{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=56}}  Comparatively, Darjeeling's tea estate workers were paid less in 2017 than tea estate workers in several [[South India|southern Indian]] states.{{efn|The same study recorded the basic 2017 daily wages (without employee benefits) for tea estate workers in the southern states of [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] to be Rs 310 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|310|USD|2017}}) per day, Rs 263 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|263|USD|2017}}) per day, and Rupees 241 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|241|USD|2017}}) per day respectively.}} The auction price of Darjeeling tea for 2017 was comparatively higher.{{efn| Rs 128.54 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|128.54|USD|2017}}) per {{Convert|1|kg|lb}}; whereas it was Rs 115.48 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|115|USD|2017}}), Rs 99.07 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|99.07|USD|2017}}), and Rs. 93.07 ({{INRConvert/HistoricalRate/Formatted|93.07|USD|2017}}) for Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu respectively.{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=58}}}}

A 2017 study found that some 60% of the plantation labour jobs in the Darjeeling area were held by women.{{Sfn|Taylor|Taylor|2017|p=96}}   The protection and economic development of the tea labour force was one of the motivations for India's enactment of the [[Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999]]. According to a 2017 study, "India has pursued the recognition of iconic brands, not only to create market share but also to recognise the value of the GI system to encourage development in poor, rural regions with high unemployment rates. This is consistent with the broad [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] objective to encourage trade liberalisation in developing countries to reduce poverty."{{Sfn|Taylor|Taylor|2017|p=96}}  Darjeeling tea was given GI recognition in Europe in spite of some [[European Union]] member nations objecting to the use of the indication for blended tea.{{Sfn|Marie-Vivien|2017|p=238}} It was recognized in US Geographical Indication mark, "DARJEELING, Registration No. 1,632,726."{{Sfn|Gervais|Slider|2017|p=32}}
[[File:Darjeeling Tea Cultivation Area 1951 to 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Area of cultivation of Darjeeling tea in [[hectare]]s ([[acre]]s) from 1951 to 2014]]

Tea is produced in the Darjeeling hills and farther below in two different forms.  Orthodox tea looks like the twisted and dried version of the green leaves on the bushes.{{efn|Citing 2017 data, a 2021 study recorded the number of tea estates in the Darjeeling hills to be 81, but their yields per {{Convert|1|hectare|acre}} were generally less than {{Convert|1500|kg|lb}}.}}  The Darjeeling sub-division of the Darjeeling hills had 46 tea estates in 2017, producing mostly orthodox tea.  This is commonly exported and is some of the world's most expensive.{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=9}}{{Sfn|Besky|2020|pp=6&ndash;7}} In the [[crush, tear, curl]], or CTC version, which is commonly grown in the Kurseong sub-division (with 29 tea estates), and the Kalimpong (with 6),{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=9}} the tea leaves are mechanically manipulated, fired, and turned into tiny hard pellets that look like instant coffee.{{Sfn|Besky|2020|p=7}} Cheaply available, and boiled with milk and sugar, when CTC tea was introduced into the Indian market in the early 1950s, it turned India into a nation of tea drinkers.{{Sfn|Besky|2020|p=8}}

The area of cultivation of Darjeeling tea increased from 16,569 hectares (in 1951) to a high of 20,065 (in 1990) and dropped to 17,820 (in 2014) according to a 2021 study.{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=28}} There were 99 tea estates in 1961; these increased until 1990 (when 102 were recorded) but dropped to 83 by 1995 and to 81 by 2014.{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=29}}  The 20% drop from 1990 to 1995 was attributed in the study to India's economic liberalisation which came into force in the very early 1990s.{{Sfn|Roy|Biswas|2021|p=29}} A 2017 study similarly reported the Indian tea industry to have been adversely affected by price drops after India's economic liberalisation in the 1990s.{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|p=535}}   Darjeeling tea garden owners invested their [[economic surplus|surplus]]es in more profitable industries elsewhere,{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|p=535}} causing a decline in productivity in the local tea industry.{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|p=535}} The [[Tea Board of India]] estimated {{Convert|7010000|kg|lb}} of Darjeeling tea was produced in 2021; this constitutes about 0.5% of total {{Convert|1343060000|kg|lb}} produced in India.<ref name="teaboard.gov.in">{{Cite web |title=State/region wise and month wise tea production data for the year 2021 |author=Tea Board of India |url=https://www.teaboard.gov.in/pdf/Production_data_for_2021_and_2021_22_pdf223.pdf |access-date=23 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713223725/https://www.teaboard.gov.in/pdf/Production_data_for_2021_and_2021_22_pdf223.pdf |archive-date=13 July 2022}}</ref>

=== Tourism===

Darjeeling has two peak tourism seasons, September to November and April to May.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|p=107}}  A 2014 study suggested that domestic tourism is the foundation of the town's vacation business.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|pp=107&ndash;108}} The [[Chowrasta (Darjeeling)|Chowrasta]] is a popular shopping and gathering area where a tourist might get their picture taken dressed in colourful and rustic local clothes.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|pp=107&ndash;108}}  The tea plantations below are particularly visited by foreign tourists.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|pp=107&ndash;108}}  Old bungalows in some plantations have been converted to deluxe lodgings in which rooms rent out dearly by any global standard.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|pp=107&ndash;108}}  Some tourists hold dear the escape to a peaceful, unspoilt, and picturesque landscape evoked in [[Satyajit Ray]]'s 1962-film ''[[Kanchenjungha (film)|Kanchenjungha]]''.{{Sfn|Besky|2014|pp=107&ndash;108}}

Darjeeling had become an important tourist destination as early as 1860.{{Sfn|Lamb|1986|p=71}}  Since India's economic liberalisation in 1991, tourism in Darjeeling has become cheaper, and  Darjeeling, once considered a  luxury destination, has become accessible to [[mass tourism]].{{Sfn|Brown|Scrase|Ganguly-Scrase|2017|p=535}} A 2016 study recorded the tourist influx into Darjeeling town between 2009 and 2014 as ranging from a low of 243,255 individuals in the 2010–2011 season to a high of 488,675 in 2012–2013; the large majority were domestic tourists, with foreign tourists never comprising more than 35,000 annual visitors.{{Sfn|Samanta|Koner|2016|p=52}}

Darjeeling can be reached by the [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] (DHR) which travels a route {{Cvt|88|km|mi}} long from Siliguri.{{Sfn|Roy|Hannam|2013|p=584}} Pulled by steam [[locomotive]]s, it moves at speeds of between {{Convert|20|km|mi}} and {{Convert|25|km|mi}} per hour.{{Sfn|Roy|Hannam|2013|p=584}}  Although the service was begun in the 19th century to move humans and freight efficiently, its primary clients today are tourists who are availing themselves of the opportunity to experience the [[mobilities]] of travel of a bygone era.{{Sfn|Roy|Hannam|2013|pp=585–588, 590–592}}  After an international and national campaign for its support, the railway was declared a [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]] in December 1999 at the 23rd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee held in Morocco.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aygen |first=Zeynep |title=International Heritage and Historic Building Conservation: Saving the World's Past |publisher=Routledge |series=Routledge Studies in Heritage Series |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-415-88814-1 |page=159 |quote=The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway Society was formed in 1997 in London to demonstrate both international and national concern in India about plans to close the historic Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in the early 1990s.  This led directly to the railway being inscribed by UNESCO in 1999 as a World Heritage Site.}}</ref>{{Sfn|Roy|Hannam|2013|p=585}} In  ''Notes on Defining the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway: World Heritage Property'', Unpublished manuscript. The DHR Archive, Kurseong, 2005, K. Weise had written:

<blockquote>The railway begins on the plains of West Bengal and soon begins climbing through a remnant of lowland jungle, including stands of teak. As the railway climbs, so the flora changes and its upper sections are dominated by enormous Himalayan pines, which in misty weather give a surreal quality to the landscape. It frequently hugs the ages of hillsides with drops, often of thousands of feet, to the plains and valleys below. Towering over the entire scene is the perennially snow-covered bulk of Kanchenjungha. ... From Kurseong the railway offers frequent views of this stupendous mountain, which by Ghoom dominates the entire landscape.{{Sfn|Roy|Hannam|2013|p=554}}</blockquote>

In a 1999 study, it was thought the tourist influx into Darjeeling had been adversely affected by the political instability in the region, including agitations in the 1980s.{{Sfn|Dasgupta|1999|p=66}} According to a 2018 study, tourism in Darjeeling is limited to a small area of the town so its effect on local employment is inadequate for alleviating Darjeeling's high unemployment rate.{{Sfn|Chettri|2018|pp=151&ndash;152}} According to the author, "The majority of the employees and almost all of the top ranking officers in West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation are Bengalis; locals generally get employed as photographers, drivers, and guides."{{Sfn|Chettri|2018|pp=151&ndash;152}}

From Senchal the water is piped to the town after purification at a filtration plant in [[Jorebungalow]].{{Sfn | Mondal | Roychowdhury | 2018 | p=372}} There are a combined {{Convert|35|km|mi}} of pipes transporting water from Senchal to Darjeeling, and a further {{Convert|83|km|mi}} in the [[water distribution system]] within Darjeeling.{{Sfn | Drew | Rai | 2018 | pp=253–254}}  In the months before the monsoon during which water in the Senchal lakes is reduced, it is augmented by pumping water electrically from another reservoir located near [[Khong Khola]].{{Sfn | Mondal | Roychowdhury | 2018 | p=372}}

A 2012 report of the Darjeeling Municipality Waterworks Department stated that from the 1930s little or no maintenance had been undertaken on the water pipeline from Senchal.{{Sfn | Drew | Rai | 2018 | pp=253–254}} Engineers in the department suggested that there might be up to 35% transmission loss, and more within Darjeeling.{{Sfn | Drew | Rai | 2018 | pp=253–254}}  Once in Darjeeling, the water is distributed along the colonial pattern, first serving more expensive and sought-after uphill neighbourhoods and then the low-income downhill ones, which have more restricted access to the supply.{{Sfn | Drew | Rai | 2018 | pp=253–254}} The system was designed to serve a population of up to 20,000 individuals.  Between 1911 and 2011, there had been a six-fold increase in the population of the municipality, not including the large number of transients such as students, migrant workers, and tourists (see [[:File:Darjeeling Municipality 10-yearly census data from 1881 to 2011.jpg|Figure&nbsp;1]]).{{Sfn | Drew | Rai | 2018 | pp=253–254}} Increasing demand has led to a worsening shortfall in the water supply.{{Sfn|Koner|Samanta|2021|p=}}  As a result, many residents have to purchase water from private vendors who either supply it in water tankers or in hand-pushed carts; they sometimes collect the water from the local ''jhora'' or springs. (see [[:File:Map of Darjeeling Municipality, Darjeeling District, West Bengal India.jpg|Map&nbsp;1]]).{{Sfn | Mondal | Roychowdhury | 2018 | p=374}} Larger private businesses are involved in supplying households but do so at a substantially higher cost.{{Sfn | Mondal | Roychowdhury | 2018 | p=374}}

Darjeeling has two major [[arterial road]]s: Hill Cart Road—which is a continuation of [[National Highway 110 (India)|National Highway 110]] connecting Siliguri at the base of the Darjeeling hills to Darjeeling—and Lebong Cart Road (see [[:File:Map of Darjeeling Municipality, Darjeeling District, West Bengal India.jpg|Map&nbsp;1]]).{{Sfn|Nag|Paul|Saha|Goswami|2018|p=490}} The average width of Darjeeling's roads in 2018 was between {{Convert|6|m|ft}} and {{Convert|7|m|ft}}.{{Sfn|Nag|Paul|Saha|Goswami|2018|p=491}} According to a Darjeeling Municipality report of 2008, a little over half (55%) of Darjeeling's roads were both metalled (paved with [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]], or bitumen) and motorable; the rest were too narrow to admit traffic whether concrete roads or [[dirt road|unpaved]].{{Sfn|Nag|Paul|Saha|Goswami|2018|p=490}} There were three parking areas that were not located on the street and 13 on-street. Illegal parking along narrow roads has created congestion for both pedestrians and wheeled transport.{{Sfn|Nag|Paul|Saha|Goswami|2018|p=491}}

As of 2018, Darjeeling had no public transport system of buses.{{Sfn|Nag|Paul|Saha|Goswami|2018|p=491}}  Less than one in 20 residents owned any form of vehicular transport, two-wheeled or four.{{Sfn|Nag|Paul|Saha|Goswami|2018|p=491}} For both locals and tourists motorized travel was limited to six- or eight-seater [[paratransit]] taxis that have no set routes or timetables. Passengers embark and disembark in the central shopping district of the town, making the area both congested and polluted.{{Sfn|Nag|Paul|Saha|Goswami|2018|p=491}}  In 2015, in an attempt to tackle the pollution, the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), which governs the district, introduced three battery-powered street-legal [[golf-cart]]-taxis on a trial basis.  The taxis had cost approximately [[Rupees]] 36 [[lakh]] (or $14,670 in the 2015 exchange rate) per vehicle.<ref name=telegraph-battery-powered/> Although the vehicles were factory-designed for a battery life of {{Convert|60|km|mi}} before requiring a recharge, their batteries were found to run out in {{Convert|5|km|mi}}.  Chalking up the disparity to the challenges of Darjeeling's steep streets, and the lack of mechanics to correct the malfunction, the administration withdrew the vehicles from the streets in 2016.<ref name=telegraph-battery-powered>{{Cite news |last=Chhetri |first=Vivek |newspaper=The Telegraph |title=Battery cars go off roads: GTA lacks mechanics to repair vehicles bought for Rs 36 lakh |date=10 May 2016 |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/battery-cars-go-off-roads/cid/1524781 |access-date=13 July 2022 |archive-date=13 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713155504/https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/battery-cars-go-off-roads/cid/1524781 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Darjeeling can be reached by motorized vehicles on National Highway 110, from Siliguri, {{Cvt|77|km|mi}} away.{{Sfn|de Bruyn|Bain|Venkatraman|Joshi|2008|p=578}} Darjeeling has road connections with [[Bagdogra]], [[Gangtok]] and [[Kathmandu]] and the neighbouring towns of Kurseong and Kalimpong.{{Sfn|de Bruyn|Bain|Venkatraman|Joshi|2008|p=578}} However, road and railway communications often get disrupted in the monsoons because of landslides.{{Sfn | Pal | Shaw | 2017 | pp=367–369}}{{Sfn | Mandal | Mondal | 2019 | p=8}} The nearest airport is [[Bagdogra Airport]], located {{Cvt|90|km|mi}} from Darjeeling.{{Sfn|de Bruyn|Bain|Venkatraman|Joshi|2008|p=578}}

According to a 2017 study, Western music has long been popular in Darjeeling.{{Sfn|Liechty|2017|p=147}}  In the "lively hippie music scene" in Kathmandu in the late 1960s, some of the earliest "Western pop performers" were from Darjeeling.{{Sfn|Liechty|2017|p=147}} The earliest Nepali-led hotel bands were from Darjeeling and many among them had played in hotels in Calcutta before.{{Sfn|Liechty|2017|p=147}} A 2004 study suggested that one possible reason for such leadership might have been that many Nepalis in Darjeeling had become Christians and were no longer bound by Hindu caste prejudices in which "musical performance is associated with low caste standing".{{Sfn|Liechty|2017|p=147}} By the early 1990s, a common middle-class western popular music culture was much in evidence among the young people of Kathmandu, Nepal and the Nepalese-speaking youth in Darjeeling.{{efn|The author of a 2004 study recalled that at a 1991 Kathmandu "Rock and Roll Music Festival", an accomplished band, the  "Hell Riders," from Darjeeling had star billing.{{Sfn|Liechty|2003|pp=196&ndash;197}}  The crowd became restless when the group played music that appealed to an older audience ([[The Doors]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]), but sang along when they switched to contemporary popular groups like [[AC/DC]] and [[Bon Jovi]].{{Sfn|Liechty|2003|pp=196&ndash;197}}}}{{Sfn|Liechty|2003|pp=196&ndash;197}}

The traditional dietary culture of the town of Darjeeling has much in common with that of the Darjeeling hills, though urbanisation has affected the food habits throughout the region.  A mug of tea with milk, with or without sugar, is traditionally the first drink of the day.  [[Butter tea]], made from [[Compressed tea|compressed tea leaves]], butter, water, milk and salt is a popular delicacy.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}}  The staple diet is eaten twice a day. The food in these regions is less spicy, cooked with either little or no oil,  and semi-boiled. The first meal is eaten in the morning with cooked rice, [[dal]], cooked vegetables mixed with potatoes, some fermented meat or milk products&mdash;[[Dahi (curd)|dahi]], or yoghurt; [[Mattha|mohi]], which is spicy buttermilk; and ''[[chhurpi]]'', a kind of hard cheese made from [[cow]] or [[yak]] milk&mdash;and pickles commonly called [[Dal bhat|bhat-dal-tharkari-achar]]. The second meal is dinner in the early evening, which consists of the same bhat-dal-tharkari-achar. Bhutia and Lepcha usually eat [[thukpa]] noodles in soup.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}}

Traditionally, the people of the region have preferred cooked rice as the staple; however, [[roti]] made of wheat is also popular, mostly among the urban population. Cooked ground maize is sometimes eaten as staple food mostly in rural areas, where it might be eaten with mohi and [[gundruk]], a fermented vegetable.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}}  [[Goyang (fermented food)|Goyang]], another fermented food, is made from the leaves of a local wild plant, abundantly available during the monsoon.  The leaves are fermented for a month and then consumed for several months afterwards.  Boiled with yak meat or beef to make a hearty thukpa soup, it is commonly prepared in Sherpa homes though seldom sold.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}}

Some ethnic foods have cultural value in festivals. Celebration of festivals with the consumption of [[sel roti]], a fermented cereal-based fried doughnut-like confectionery, is a custom of the Gorkha. Dahi, a fermented milk product, is consumed as a savoury addition to daily diets.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}} It is also used by the Gorkha to make a paste with rice and food colour for applying to the foreheads of the younger members of the family by their elders during festivals and marriages. Alcoholic drinks can have a similar dual purpose; in addition to being consumed directly they are offered to gods and in the [[veneration of the dead]]. In some communities, they have been employed in [[spirit possession]] rituals.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}}

Some [[Brahmin]] Gorkhas are vegetarians. [[Non-vegetarian]]s eat chicken, mutton, buffalo, and pork. Beef is taboo to a majority of the Gorkha except for Tamang and Sherpa. Newar prefers buffalo meat.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}} About two-thirds of people prepare ethnic fermented foods at home for consumption. Cooking is usually done by women. Traditionally members of the family sit together on bamboo mats in the kitchen, and meals are served by the female members of the family and then usually eaten by hand, though chopsticks made of bamboo are commonly used by the Bhutia and Tibetans. Plates are made of brass or have a thin layer of brass.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}}

Popular alcoholic beverages sold in Darjeeling town include ''[[tongba]]'', ''Jnaard'' (pronounced as Jaar) and ''[[chhaang]]'', variations of a local beer made from fermenting [[finger millet]].{{Sfn|Tamang|Sarkar|Hesseltine|1988|p=382}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Tibetan-English Dictionary |publisher=Motilal Banarsidas |year=1881 |isbn=978-81-208-0321-3 |edition=1987 reprint |page=341 |author=H. Ä. Jaschke |place=Delhi}}</ref>  A popular food in Darjeeling is the ''[[momo (food)|momo]]'', a steamed dumpling containing pork, beef, chicken or vegetables (cabbage or potatoes) cooked in a doughy wrapping and served with watery soup. [[Wai-Wai (food)|Wai-Wai]], originally a product of Nepal, is a packaged snack consisting of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form.{{Sfn|Thapa|Tamang|2020|pp=479–537}}

In the Darjeeling municipality in 2003&ndash;2004, there were  16,015 students in [[education in India#Primary education|primary schools]], 5,169 in [[Education in India#12th (senior secondary or Intermediate Course) exam|higher-secondary schools]], and 3,825 in [[Education in India#Higher education|colleges and universities]].{{Sfn|Deuchar|2013|p=55}}  According to a 2013 study, few students attended college for there seemed little scope for realizing "middle-class aspirations in Darjeeling through educational credentials".{{Sfn|Deuchar|2013|p=55}} It noted that the fees in the better-funded private colleges, although affordable for the upper-level government officials or successful businesspersons, were too high for the lower-middle-classes in town.{{Sfn|Deuchar|2013|pp=56&ndash;57}} This put pressure on the only affordable college, the government college in the town's centre.{{Sfn|Deuchar|2013|pp=56&ndash;57}}  It was lower-priced but poorly funded, with broken windows, leaking roofs, and absent teachers, causing the students to feel neglected and affecting their attendance.{{Sfn|Deuchar|2013|pp=56&ndash;57}}  The teachers for their part were unable to meet the extra demands placed on them.{{Sfn|Deuchar|2013|pp=56&ndash;57}}

A 2022 study noted that among the population of Darjeeling that lives in slums (comprising 11.72% of the town's population as per the 2011 census), 13% had finished primary school but had gone no further, 45% had finished high school (grade 10) but no further, 13% had finished higher-secondary (grade 10+2), and 10% had been to college.<ref name = chhetri-slums-education>{{Cite journal |last=Chhetri |first=Bishal |title=Assessing the urban sustainability of the slum settlements in the hill resorts of India: a case study of Darjeeling town |date=3 August 2022 |doi=10.1007/s10708-022-10728-y |pages=11&ndash;12 |journal=GeoJournal |volume=88 |issue=2 |publisher=Springer Nature |s2cid=251331284}}</ref> A 2018 study reported that the water crisis in the Darjeeling town has especially affected adolescent girl students who go to government schools.{{Sfn|Koner|2018|pp=95&ndash;95}} Many do not have [[WASH|access to hygiene facilities such as toilets and bathrooms]], either in their homes or at school, particularly for [[Menstrual hygiene management#Sanitation facilities at schools|hygiene management]] during [[menstruation]]. The study found that most toilets in government schools were not usable and that no government schools had "proper sanitary facilities for girls.

It stated that many girls do not drink water during the day for fear of having to use the school toilets.{{Sfn|Koner|2018|pp=95&ndash;95}}

Most tea plantations make no more than lower primary school instruction available on site.{{Sfn|Lama|2022|p=345}} As a result, tea garden workers have typically had fewer opportunities for education.{{Sfn|Lama|2022|p=338}} As of 2022, a little over a third of the female workforce and half the male were educated up to grade&nbsp;8. The workers attributed this to their tea garden's remoteness and lack of means in the family during their childhood.{{Sfn|Lama|2022|p=338}}  Some families have raised chickens or livestock or opened a [[corner shop]] to make more money; their children have gone to nearby towns to study in private schools in which the medium of instruction is English, which is thought to offer better career opportunities.{{Sfn|Lama|2022|p=345}}  The Nepali language was accepted as a teaching language in all primary schools with a Nepali-speaking majority in the Darjeeling district in 1935.{{Sfn|Gellner|2014|pp= 138–140|ps=.
