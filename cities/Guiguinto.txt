'''Guiguinto''', officially the '''Municipality of Guiguinto''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Guiguinto}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 113,415 people.{{PH census|current}} It is {{convert|34|km|sp=us}} from [[Manila]] and {{convert|11|km|sp=us}} from [[Malolos City]].

With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], Guiguinto is part of [[Greater Manila Area|Manila's built-up area]] which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan]] at its northernmost part.

It is the birthplace of composer Constancio De Guzman, known for writing songs like "''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya (song)|Maalaala Mo Kaya]]''". It also houses the Immaculate Conception Seminary, a Diocesan Seminary of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos|Diocese of Malolos]] located in barangay Tabe. The appellation “Guiguinto” literally translates to “[[Gold]]” (''ginto'' for Tagalog, ''gintu'' for Kapampangan) for the early conquistadores came and saw this town on a harvest season when it lushes in golden rice stalks against the sun.

==History==
Guiguinto began as a barrio of [[Bulakan]], the former provincial capital of Bulacan. It is said that Spaniards set up an army post in the barrio to serve as a resting place for forces going to Northern Luzon. In those days, travel throughout Guiguinto was difficult and slow down to cross single file over a narrow bamboo bridge. Their Filipino guides would cry out, "''Hinto''" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for stop). The Spaniards thought this was the name "Hihinto". The Spaniards substituted "Gui" (with hard "g") for the Tagalog "Hi". The place has since been called Guiguinto. On the other hand, old timers say that on moonlight nights, a golden bull emerges from the church and goes down to the nearby river to quench his thirst. It then returns to the church, ascends at the altar and disappears. The elders' aid that there are buried jars of gold in town, as indicated by the bull, and that is why the town was called Guiguinto. It became an [[encomienda]] in the 1591 but the ecclesiastical administration was under Bulakan Convent and it was established as a town in 1641.
[[File:Agatha_Paula_A._Cruz_smiling1.jpg|100px|thumbnail|left|[[Mayor]] Agatha Paula A. Cruz]]
In 1800, an Augustinian friar erected a small chapel in what is now barrio Santa Rita. In 1873, roads were constructed in barrio Malis. The people barrios of Pritil, Tabe, and Cutcut even those days were mostly farmers. During [[Holy Week]], villagers of barrio Tuktukan held contest for the hardest egg shells (chicken, duck or goose by knocking eggs together (Tuktukan)). The women tried to help each other in singing the "Panica".

Just before the outbreak of the revolution of 1896, the town people of Guiguinto were ordered to sleep in the town at night and to work in their fields only in the day. This was said to have been suggested by the town priest to the authorities because of rumors that many of the town people were joining the secret revolutionary society, the Katipunan. Guiguinto eventually contributed many soldiers to the 1896 revolution.

At the time of American occupation, the new colonizers reorganized the Province of Bulacan into 19 municipalities from the original 26. Under populated town were subordinated with the large one and the town of Guiguinto was integrated in the town of Bulakan for almost 11 years. In 1915, Guiguinto regain its township again with Antonio Figueroa as its municipal mayor of the modern period. The town's population was then about 4,000. The 1960 census placed Guiguinto's population at 10,629. Guiguinto is bounded on the east by the town of Balagtas, on the west by Malolos City, on the north by Plaridel, and on the south by Bulacan.
