* [[Latin]]: ''Posnania''}} is a city on the [[Warta|River Warta]] in west [[Poland]], within the [[Greater Poland]] region. The city is an important cultural and business centre, and one of Poland's most populous regions with many regional customs such as [[Saint John's Fair, Poznań|Saint John's Fair]] (''Jarmark Świętojański''), traditional [[St. Martin's Croissant|Saint Martin's croissants]] and a [[Dialects of Polish|local dialect]]. Among its most important heritage sites are the [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] Old Town, [[Poznań Town Hall|Town Hall]] and [[Poznań Cathedral|Gothic Cathedral]].

Poznań is the fifth-largest and one of the oldest [[cities in Poland]]. As of 2023, the city's population is 540,146, while the [[Poznań metropolitan area]] (''Metropolia Poznań'') comprising [[Poznań County]] and several other communities is inhabited by over 1.029&nbsp;million people.<ref name=metro_pop/> It is one of four historical [[:pl:Stołeczne Miasto Poznań|capitals of medieval Poland]] and the ancient capital of the [[Greater Poland]] region, currently the administrative capital of the province called [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]].

Poznań is a centre of trade, sport, education, technology and tourism. It is an important academic site, with about 130,000 students and [[Adam Mickiewicz University]], the third largest Polish university. The city serves as the seat of the oldest Polish [[diocese]], now being one of the most populous [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poznań|Catholic archdioceses]] in the country. The city also hosts the [[Poznań International Fair]], the biggest industrial fair in Poland and one of the largest fairs in Europe. The city's other renowned landmarks include the [[National Museum, Poznań|National Museum]], [[Grand Theatre, Poznań|Grand Theatre]], [[Poznań Fara|Fara Church]] and the [[Imperial Castle, Poznań|Imperial Castle]].

Poznań is classified as a [[global city|Gamma−global city]] by [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The World According to GaWC 2020 |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |website=GaWC - Research Network |publisher=Globalization and World Cities |access-date=31 August 2020}}</ref> According to several rankings it is one of the most business-friendly cities in Poland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poznan.pl/mim/studia/en/high-quality-of-life,p,23177,23178,23267.html |title=High quality of life – Study – Poznan.pl|access-date=25 April 2017}}</ref> It also ranks highly in safety and [[Healthcare in Poland|healthcare quality]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/in/Poznan |title=Quality of Life in Poznan|access-date=25 April 2017}}</ref> The city of Poznań has also, many times, won the prize awarded by "[[Superbrands]]" for a very high quality city brand. In 2012, the Poznań's Art and Business Centre "[[Stary Browar]]" won a competition organised by [[National Geographic Traveler]] and was given the first prize as one of the seven "New Polish Wonders". Companies headquartered in the city include energy provider [[Enea SA|Enea]], e-commerce company [[Allegro (website)|Allegro]] and convenience store chain [[Żabka (convenience store)|Żabka]].

The official [[patron saint]]s of Poznań are [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Tarsus]], the patrons of the cathedral. [[Martin of Tours]] – the patron of the main street [[Święty Marcin]] – is also regarded as one of the patron saints of the city.

==Names==
{{See also|Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_(M–P)#P|l1=Names of Poznań in different languages}}
The name Poznań probably comes from a personal name ''Poznan'', which was in turn derived from the [[Polish language|Polish]] participle {{lang|pl|poznan(y)}} – "one who is known/recognized", and would mean "Poznan's town". It is also possible that the name comes directly from the verb ''poznać'', which means "to get to know" or "to recognize", so it may simply mean "known town".

[[File:Poznań seal from XIV century.PNG|thumb|upright|left|14th-century seal showing Poznań's coat of arms.]]

The earliest surviving references to the city are found in the [[chronicle]]s of [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] written between 1012 and 1018: {{lang|la|episcopus Posnaniensis}} ("[[List of Bishops of Poznań|bishop of Poznań]]", in an entry for 970) and ''ab urbe Posnani'' ("from the city of Poznań", for 1005). The city's name appears in documents in the Latin [[nominative case]] as ''Posnania'' in 1236 and ''Poznania'' in 1247. The phrase ''in Poznan'' appears in 1146 and 1244.

The city's full official name is ''Stołeczne Miasto Poznań'' (The Capital City of Poznań), in reference to its role as a centre of political power in the [[Piast Poland|early Polish state]] under the [[Piast dynasty]]. Poznań is known as ''Posen'' in [[German language|German]], and was officially called ''Haupt- und Residenzstadt Posen'' (Capital and Residence City of Poznań) between 20 August 1910 and 28 November 1918. The [[Latin]] names of the city are ''Posnania'' and ''Civitas Posnaniensis''. Its [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name is {{lang|yi|פּױזן}}, or ''Poyzn''.

In Polish, the city's name has masculine [[grammatical gender]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Poznań|Timeline of Poznań|Historical population of Poznań}}

===Early Middle Ages===
For centuries before the [[Baptism of Poland|Christianization of Poland]] (an event that essentially is credited as the creation of the very first Polish state, the [[Duchy of Poland (1031-1076)|Duchy of Poland]]), Poznań was an important cultural and political centre of the [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]]. It consisted of a fortified [[stronghold]] between the [[Warta]] and [[Cybina]] rivers on what is now [[Ostrów Tumski, Poznań|Ostrów Tumski]]. [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the first historically recorded ruler of the West Polans and of the early Polish state which they dominated, built one of his main stable [[headquarters]] in Poznań. [[Christianization of Poland|Mieszko's baptism]] in AD 966, seen as a defining moment in the [[Christianization]] of the Polish state, may have taken place in Poznań.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dobosz |first=Józef |date=2002 |title=Monarchia i możni wobec Kościoła w Polsce do początku XIII wieku |location=Poznań |publisher=Wydawn. Poznańskie |page=47 |isbn=9788371771101 |language=pl}}</ref>

===11th to 16th centuries===

Following the [[baptism]], construction began of [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Poznań|Poznań's cathedral]], the first in Poland. Poznań was probably the main seat of the first [[missionary]] bishop sent to Poland, [[Bishop Jordan]]. The [[Congress of Gniezno]] in 1000 led to the country's first permanent [[archbishopric]] being established in [[Gniezno]] (which is generally regarded as Poland's capital in that period), although Poznań continued to have independent bishops of its own. Poznań's cathedral was the place of burial of the early [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] monarchs, among them Mieszko I, [[Bolesław I the Brave]], [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II Lambert]], [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], and later of [[Przemysł I of Poland|Przemysł I]] and [[Przemysł II of Poland|Przemysł II]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Instytut Zachodni |date=1988 |title=Życie i myśl |volume=37 |issue=1–6 |location=Warszawa (Warsaw) |publisher=Pax |page=47 |oclc=473901657}}</ref>

The [[pagan reaction in Poland|pagan reaction]] that followed Mieszko II's death (probably in Poznań) in 1034 left the region weak, and in 1038, Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] of [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]] sacked and destroyed both Poznań and Gniezno. Poland was reunited under [[Casimir the Restorer|Casimir I the Restorer]] in 1039, but the capital was moved to [[Kraków]], which had been relatively unaffected by the troubles. In 1138, by the [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty|testament of Boleslaus III]], Poland was divided into separate [[Duchy|duchies]] under the late king's sons, and Poznań and its surroundings became the domain of [[Mieszko III the Old]], the first of the [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Dukes of Greater Poland]]. This period of fragmentation lasted until 1320. Duchies frequently changed hands; control of Poznań, Gniezno and [[Kalisz]] sometimes lay with a single duke, but at other times these constituted separate duchies.

In about 1249, Duke [[Przemysł I]] began constructing what would become the [[Royal Castle, Poznan|Royal Castle]] on a hill on the left bank of the [[Warta]]. Then in 1253, Przemysł issued a charter to Thomas of [[Gubin, Poland|Gubin]] for the founding of a town under [[Magdeburg law]], between the castle and the river. Thomas brought a large number of German settlers to aid in the building and settlement of the city – this is an example of the German eastern migration ({{Lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}) characteristic of that period.<ref name=Brather87156159>{{cite book |last=Brather |first=Sebastian |title=Archäologie der westlichen Slawen.

[[File:Poznan Braun Hohenberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Poznań, {{circa}} 1617, view from the north.]]

In reunited Poland, and later in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Poznań was the seat of a [[Poznań Voivodeship (14th century to 1793)|voivodeship]]. The city's importance began to grow in the [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonian]] period, due to its position on trading routes from [[Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and [[Ruthenia]] to western Europe. It would become a major center for the [[fur trade]] by the late 16th century. Suburban settlements developed around the city walls, on the river islands, and on the right bank, with some (Ostrów Tumski, [[Śródka, Poznań|Śródka]], Chwaliszewo, Ostrówek) obtaining their own town charters. However, the city's development was hampered by regular major fires and floods. On 2 May 1536 a fire destroyed 175 buildings, including the castle, the town hall, the monastery, and the [[suburb]]an settlement called St. Martin.<ref>J. Perles: ''Geschichte der Juden in Posen''. In: ''Monatsschrift für Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums''. Vol. 13, Breslau 1864, pp. 321–334 (in German, [https://books.google.com/books?id=z61K1O9KYooC&pg=PA323 online].)</ref> In 1519, the [[Lubrański Academy]] had been established in Poznań as an institution of higher education, but without the right to award degrees, which was reserved to Kraków's [[Jagiellonian University]]. However, the [[Jesuits]]' college, founded in the city in 1571 during the [[Counter-Reformation]], had the right to award degrees from 1611 until 1773, when it was combined with the academy.

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Iglesia colegial de Poznan, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 34-36 HDR.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior details in Collegiate Basilica known as ''[[Poznań Fara|Fara]]'' built in 1651–1705; one of the finest examples of [[Baroque in Poland|baroque architecture in Poland]].]]

In the second half of the 17th century and most of the 18th, Poznań was severely affected by a series of wars, attendant military occupations, lootings and destruction – the [[Second Northern War|Second]] and [[Third Northern War|Third Northern]] Wars, the [[War of the Polish Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[Bar Confederation]]. During the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], Poznań's [[Jews in Poland|Jewish]] community was accused of collaborating with the invading [[Swedish Army|Swedish enemy]], and as a result suffered [[pogrom]]s carried out by both the city's non-Jewish residents and units of the Polish [[Crown Army]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Poznań |url=https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Poznan |access-date=2023-09-04 |website=yivoencyclopedia.org}}</ref>

It was also hit by frequent outbreaks of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], and by floods, particularly that of 1736, which destroyed most of the suburban buildings. The population of the conurbation declined from 20,000 around 1600 to 6,000 around 1730, and [[Bamberg]]ian and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers ([[Bambers]] and [[Olęders]]) were brought in to rebuild the devastated suburbs. In 1778, a "Committee of Good Order" (''Komisja Dobrego Porządku'') was established in the city, which oversaw rebuilding efforts and reorganized the city's administration. However, in 1793, in the [[Second Partition of Poland]], Poznań came under the control of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], becoming part of (and initially the seat of) the province of [[South Prussia]].

===19th century to World War I===
The Prussian authorities expanded the city boundaries, making the walled city and its closest suburbs into a single administrative unit. Left-bank suburbs were incorporated in 1797, and Ostrów Tumski, Chwaliszewo, Śródka, Ostrówek and Łacina (St. Roch) in 1800. The old city walls were taken down in the early 19th century, and major development took place to the west of the old city, with many of the main streets of today's city center being laid out.

}}

In the [[Greater Poland uprising of 1806]], Polish soldiers and civilian volunteers assisted the efforts of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] by driving out Prussian forces from the region. The city became a part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in 1807, and was the seat of [[Poznań Department]] – a unit of administrative division and local government. However, in 1815, following the [[Congress of Vienna]], the region was returned to Prussia, and Poznań became the capital of the semi-autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Posen]]. Around 1820, Poznań had over 20,000 inhabitants, 70% of whom were Poles, 20% Jews, and 10% Germans.

The city continued to expand, and various projects were funded by Polish philanthropists, such as the [[Raczyński Library]] and the Bazar hotel. The city's first railway, running north-west to [[Stargard]], opened in 1848. Due to its strategic location, the Prussian authorities intended to make Poznań into a fortress city, building a ring of defensive fortifications around it. Work began on the [[citadel]] with ''[[Fort Winiary]]'' in 1828, and in subsequent years the entire set of defenses called ''[[Festung Posen]]'' was completed.

A [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848]] was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Grand Duchy lost its remaining autonomy, Poznań becoming simply the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Posen]]. It would become part of the [[German Empire]] with the [[Unification of Germany|unification of German states]] in 1871. Polish patriots continued to form societies such as the [[Central Economic Society for the Grand Duchy of Poznań]], and [[Polish Theatre in Poznań|Polish Theatre]] opened in 1875. It became a national stage for the inhabitants of the province of Posen, and even in whole [[Greater Poland|Greater Poland region]], acting as a mainstay of polish tradition and culture, and as a sign of resistance against the restrictive policies of the Prussian partition authorities. However, the authorities made efforts to [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanize]] the region, particularly through the [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] founded in 1886. Germans accounted for 38% of the city's population in 1867, though this percentage would later decline somewhat, particularly after the region returned to Poland.
[[File:Juliusz Knorr - Widok Starego Rynku w Poznaniu w 1838 roku.jpg|thumb|Poznań in the 19th century]]
Another expansion of ''Festung Posen'' was planned, with an outer ring of more widely spaced forts around the perimeter of the city. Building of the first nine forts began in 1876, and nine intermediate forts were built from 1887. The inner ring of fortifications was now considered obsolete and came to be mostly taken down by the early 20th century, although the citadel remained in use. This made space for further civilian construction, particularly the [[Imperial Castle, Poznań|Prussian Royal Residence Palace]] (''Zamek'') which was completed in 1910, and other grand buildings around it, including today's central university buildings and the opera house. The city's boundaries were also significantly extended to take in former suburban villages: Piotrowo and Berdychowo in 1896, Łazarz, Górczyn, [[Jeżyce, Poznań|Jeżyce]] and [[Wilda, Poznań|Wilda]] in 1900, and Sołacz in 1907.

In 1910, Poznań had 156,696 inhabitants, of which nearly 60% were Poles (over 91,000 Polish inhabitants of the city), and around 40% were Germans (over 65,000 German inhabitants of the city). Other nationalities accounted for 1-2% of the population (mainly Jews).  Germans tended to settle in the newer western part of the city, the ''Kaiserviertel'' or Kaiser district, Poles in the older east side.  And while there was tension between the two major populations there was also some overlap between them, particularly in cultural events.<ref>[https://www.copernico.eu/en/articles/divided-city-entertainment-and-pleasure-culture-posen-around-1900 A divided city?

===Interbellum===
[[File:Hotel Bazar 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Successful [[Greater Poland uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland uprising]] broke out on 27 December 1918 after a patriotic speech by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] at [[:pl:Hotel Bazar w Poznaniu|Hotel Bazar]], pictured in that period.]]
[[File:Stary Rynek w Poznaniu 1934.jpg|thumb|right|Old Market Square in 1934. The Odwach [[guardhouse]] and the 1893 New Town Hall, which was not rebuilt after World War II, are visible.]]

At the end of [[World War I]], the final [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland Uprising]] in 1918–1919 brought Poznań and most of the region back to newly reborn Poland, which was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The local German populace had to acquire Polish citizenship or leave the country. This led to a wide emigration of the ethnic Germans of the town's population – the town's German population decreased from 65,321 in 1910 to 5,980 in 1926 and further to 4,387 in 1934.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVg_tMs_ZPIC&q=adelnau&pg=PA365 |title=Polens Politik gegenüber seiner deutschen Minderheit 1919–1939 |first1=Albert S. |last1=Kotowski |page=56 |publisher=Forschungsstelle Ostmitteleuropa, [[University of Dortmund]] |year=1998 |language=de |isbn=3-447-03997-3}}</ref>

In the interwar [[Second Polish Republic]], the city again became the capital of [[Poznań Voivodeship]]. Poznań's university, today called [[Adam Mickiewicz University]], was founded in 1919, and in 1924 the [[Poznań International Fair]] began. In 1929, the fair site was the venue for a major National Exhibition (''Powszechna Wystawa Krajowa'', popularly ''PeWuKa'') marking the tenth anniversary of independence; organized on a space of 650,000 square metres it attracted around 4.5&nbsp;million visitors. In the 1930s, the fair ranked as European fourth largest organiser of international trade events.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-29|title=Snapshots frozen in time.

===World War II===
During the [[Occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] of 1939–1945, Poznań was incorporated into the [[Nazi Germany]] as the capital of ''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]''. Many Polish inhabitants, even children as young as 10, were executed, arrested, [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expelled]] to the [[General Government]] or used as [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Andrzej|editor-last=Kostkiewicz|editor-first=Janina|year=2020|title=Zbrodnia bez kary...

The German population increased from around 5,000 in 1939 (some 2% of the inhabitants) to around 95,000 in 1944.<ref>Jerzy Topolski. ''Dzieje Poznania w latach 1793–1945: 1918–1945''.

A [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] was set up in [[Fort VII]], one of the 19th-century perimeter forts. The camp was later moved to [[Żabikowo, Luboń|Żabikowo]] south of Poznań. Also the [[Stalag XXI-D]] [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|German prisoner-of-war camp]] for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] POWs of various nationalities was based in the city.

The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] was active in Poznań with various organizations and activities, and even an underground Polish parliament was established in the city.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Pietrowicz|first=Aleksandra|year=2011|title=Konspiracja wielkopolska 1939–1945|magazine=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej|language=pl|publisher=IPN|issue=5–6 (126–127)|page=36|issn=1641-9561}}</ref>

The Nazi authorities significantly expanded Poznań's boundaries to include most of the present-day area of the city; these boundaries were retained after the war. Poznań was captured by the [[Red Army]], assisted by Polish volunteers, on 23 February 1945 following the [[Battle of Poznań (1945)|Battle of Poznań]], in which the German army conducted a last-ditch defense in line with Hitler's designation of the city as a ''[[German World War II strongholds|Festung]]''. The [[Poznań Citadel|Citadel]] was the last point to be taken, and the fighting left much of the city, particularly the Old Town, in ruins. Many monuments were also destroyed, including [[Gutzon Borglum]]'s statue of [[Woodrow Wilson]] in Poznan.<ref>Price, Waldine, ''Gutzon Borglum: The Man Who Carved a Mountain'', Waldine Price, 1961 p. 181.</ref>

===1945–present===
Due to the [[expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II|expulsion and flight of German population]] Poznań's post-war population became almost uniformly Polish. The city again became a voivodeship capital. In 1950, the size of [[Poznań Voivodeship]] was reduced, and the city itself was given separate voivodeship status. This status was lost in the 1975 reforms, which also significantly reduced the size of Poznań Voivodeship.

}}
The [[Poznań 1956 protests]] are seen as an early instance of discontent with communist rule. In June 1956, a protest by workers at the city's [[Cegielski]] locomotive factory developed into a series of strikes and popular protests against the policies of the government. After a protest march on 28 June was fired on, crowds attacked the communist party and secret police headquarters, where they were repulsed by gunfire. Riots continued for two days until being quelled by the army; 67 people were killed according to official figures. A [[Monument to the Victims of June 1956|monument to the victims]] was erected in 1981 at Plac Mickiewicza.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/poland/wielkopolska/poznan/sights/landmarks-monuments/monument-victims-june-1956 |title=Monument to the Victims of June 1956 |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=28 June 1981 |access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref>

The post-war years had seen much reconstruction work on buildings damaged in the fighting. From the 1960s onwards intensive housing development took place, consisting mainly of [[Panelak|pre-fabricated concrete blocks of flats]], especially in [[Rataje, Poznań|Rataje]] and [[Winogrady]], and later [[Piątkowo, Poznań|Piątkowo]], following its incorporation into the city in 1974. Another infrastructural change, which was completed in 1968, was the rerouting of the river [[Warta]] to follow two straight branches either side of Ostrów Tumski.

[[File:654320 Poznań baszta 02.JPG|thumb|On the right remnants of the medieval town walls with two small towers.]]

The most recent expansion of the city's boundaries took place in 1987, with the addition of new areas mainly to the north, including [[Morasko]], Radojewo and [[Kiekrz]]. The first free local elections following the [[fall of communism]] took place in 1990. With the [[Polish local government reforms]] of 1999, Poznań again became the capital of a larger province entitled [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]]. It also became the seat of a ''[[powiat]]'' [[Poznań County]], with the city itself gaining separate ''powiat'' status.

[[Post-communism]] infrastructural developments include the opening of the [[Poznań Fast Tram|''Pestka'' Fast Tram]] route in 1997, and Poznań's first motorway connections in 2003 as Poland's east–west [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 highway]] runs south of the city centre, serving also as a bypass. In 2006 country's first [[F-16 Fighting Falcons]] came to be stationed at the [[31st Air Base]] in [[Nowe Miasto, Poznań|Krzesiny]] in the south-east of the city.

Poznań continues to host regular trade fairs and international events, including the [[2008 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in 2008. It was one of the host cities for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

==Geography==

===Location and topography===
{{Further|Geography of Poland}}
[[File:Poznań by Sentinel-2, 2022-05-10.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Poznań.]]

Poznań covers an area of {{convert|261.3|km2|1|abbr=on}}, and has coordinates in the range 52°17'34<nowiki>''</nowiki>–52°30'27<nowiki>''</nowiki>N, 16°44'08<nowiki>''</nowiki>–17°04'28<nowiki>''</nowiki>E. Its highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|157|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the summit of Morasko hill within the [[Morasko meteorite nature reserve]] in the north of the city. The lowest altitude is {{convert|60|m|0|abbr=on}}, in the [[Warta]] valley.

Poznań's main river is the [[Warta]], which flows through the city from south to north. As it approaches the city centre it divides into two branches, flowing west and east of [[Ostrów Tumski, Poznań|Ostrów Tumski]] Cathedral island, and meeting again further north. The smaller [[Cybina]] river flows through eastern Poznań to meet the east branch of the Warta, which is also called Cybina – its northern section was originally a continuation of that river, while its southern section has been artificially widened to form a main stream of the Warta. Other tributaries of the Warta within Poznań are the Junikowo Stream ''(Strumień Junikowski)'', which flows through southern Poznań from the west, meeting the Warta just outside the city boundary in [[Luboń]]; the Bogdanka and Wierzbak, formerly two separate tributaries flowing from the north-west and along the north side of the city centre, now with their lower sections diverted underground; the Główna, flowing through the neighbourhood of the same name in north-east Poznań; and the Rose Stream ''(Strumień Różany)'' flowing east from Morasko in the north of the city. The course of the Warta in central Poznań was formerly quite different from today: the main stream ran between Grobla and Chwaliszewo, which were originally both islands. The branch west of Grobla (the ''Zgniła Warta'' – "rotten Warta") was filled in late in the 19th century, and the former main stream west of Chwaliszewo was diverted and filled in during the 1960s. This was done partly to prevent floods, which did serious damage to Poznań frequently throughout history.

[[File:Kierskie Poznan 2.JPG|thumb|The largest of city's's four major lakes, [[Kiekrz, Poznań|Great Kierskie Lake]], is a centre of sailing and iceboating.]]

Poznań's largest lake is [[Kiekrz, Poznań|Kiekrz]] in the north-west end of the city. Other large lakes include [[Lake Malta|Malta]], an artificial lake formed in 1952 on the lower Cybina river, [[Strzeszyn, Poznań|Strzeszyn]] on the Bogdanka, and [[Lake Rusałka (Poznań)|Rusałka]], an artificial lake formed in 1943 further down the Bogdanka river. The latter two are popular bathing places. Kiekrz lake is much used for [[sailing]], while Malta is a competitive [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[canoeing]] venue.

The city centre – including the [[Poznań Old Town|Old Town]], the former islands of Grobla and Chwaliszewo, the main street [[Święty Marcin]] and many other important buildings and districts – lies on the west side of the Warta. Opposite it between the two branches of the Warta is Ostrów Tumski, containing [[Poznań Cathedral|Cathedral]] and other ecclesiastical buildings, as well as housing and industrial facilities. Facing the cathedral on the east bank of the river is the historic district of [[Śródka, Poznań|Śródka]]. Large areas of apartment blocks, built from the 1960s onwards, include [[Rataje, Poznań|Rataje]] in the east, and [[Winogrady]] and [[Piątkowo, Poznań|Piątkowo]] north of the centre. Older residential and commercial districts include those of Wilda, Łazarz and Górczyn to the south, and Jeżyce to the west. There are also significant areas of forest within the city boundaries, particularly in the east adjoining [[Swarzędz]], and around the lakes in the north-west.

The climate of Poznań is within the transition zone between a [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'' to ''Dfb'' although it just fits in the second in the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm) and with relatively cold winters and warm summers. Snow is common in winter, when night-time temperatures are typically below zero. In summer temperatures may often reach {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Annual rainfall is more than {{convert|500|mm|0|abbr=on}}, among the lowest in Poland. The rainiest month is July, mainly due to short but intense cloudbursts and thunderstorms. The number of hours of sunshine are among the highest in the country. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[humid continental climate]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=3321&cityname=Poznan%2C+Wielkopolskie%2C+Poland&units= |title=Poznan, Poland Köppen Climate Classification |website=Weatherbase.com |access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref> The warmest temperature was recorded on 11 July 1959 at {{convert|38.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}

==Administration==
===Government and politics===
[[File:Plac Kolegiacki w Poznaniu (cropped)2.jpg|thumb|left|The seat of the City Hall of Poznań is located in the former Jesuit College.]]
The city of Poznań, serving as the administrative center of the [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]], houses both the Voivode of Greater Poland and the Marshal of Greater Poland. Poznań, which holds the status of both a municipality and a county city, is home not only to the local authorities of Poznań but also to the authorities of the [[Poznań County]]. Additionally, the city hosts the[Union of Polish Cities and the Association of Municipalities and Counties of [[Greater Poland]].<ref name="adm">{{cite web |title=Oficjalna strona Miasta Poznania - Administracja|url=https://www.poznan.pl/mim/s8a/-,p,25059.html |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

The Poznań City Council is the legislative and supervisory body, elected for a four-year term. The current council members were elected in 2023. The council consists of 37 members. The Chairman of the Poznań City Council is Grzegorz Ganowicz (KO), and the Vice-Chairpersons are Przemysław Alexandrowicz (PiS), Agnieszka Lewandowska (KO), and Halina Owsianna. The council members collaborate within 14 permanent committees.<ref name="adm"/>
[[File:Urząd marszałkowski województwa wielkopolskiego w Poznaniu (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Marshal's Office of the Greater Poland Voivodeship]]

The office of the President of Poznań is held by [[Jacek Jaśkowiak]], with the Deputy Presidents being Mariusz Wiśniewski, Jędrzej Solarski, and Natalia Weremczuk. The position of City Treasurer is occupied by Barbara Sajnaj, while Stanisław Tamm serves as the City Secretary.<ref name="adm"/>

Administrative services for citizens are managed by 30 departments and equivalent organizational units of the City of Poznań Office. Additionally, the city operates 328 municipal organizational units to fulfill various public tasks. Throughout the year, the departments of the City of Poznań Office and municipal administrative units issue approximately 565,000 administrative decisions.<ref name="adm"/>

Poznań is divided into 42 neighbourhoods called ''[[osiedle]]'', each of which has its own elected council with certain decision-making and spending powers. The first uniform elections for these councils covering the whole area of the city were held on 20 March 2011.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

For certain administrative purposes, the old division into five districts called ''[[dzielnica]]'' is used – although they ceased to be governmental units in 1990. These are:
* [[Poznan-Stare Miasto|Stare Miasto]] (Old Town), population 161,200, area {{convert|47.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the central and northern parts of the city
* [[Poznan-Nowe Miasto|Nowe Miasto]] (New Town), population 141,424, area {{convert|105.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, including all parts of the city on the east bank of the [[Warta]]
* [[Poznan-Grunwald|Grunwald]], population 125,500, area {{convert|36.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the south-western parts of the city
* [[Poznan-Jezyce|Jeżyce]], population 81,300, area {{convert|57.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the north-western parts of the city
* [[Poznan-Wilda|Wilda]], population 62,290, area {{convert|15.0|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, in the southern part of the city

Many citizens of Poznań thanks to the strong economy of the city and high salaries started moving to suburbs of the [[Poznań County]] ([[powiat]]) in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} Although the number of inhabitants in Poznań itself was decreasing for the past two decades, the suburbs gained almost twice as many inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} The Poznań [[metropolitan area]] ''Metropolia Poznań'' comprising [[Poznań County]] and several other communities is home to over 1&nbsp;million inhabitants.<ref name=metro_pop/> The complex infrastructure, population density, number of companies and gross product per capita of Poznań suburbs may be only compared to Warsaw suburbs.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} Many parts of closer suburbs such as [[Tarnowo Podgorne]], [[Komorniki]], [[Suchy Las]], and [[Dopiewo]] produce more in terms of GDP per capita than the city itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==Architecture==
===Gothic===
[[File:Poznań Św Wojciech 382-39.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Polychromes in [[Church of St. Adalbert, Poznań|St. Adalbert's Church]].]]
The relocation of Poznań from the right to the left bank of the [[Warta]] River occurred in the mid-13th century, during the height of the [[Gothic architecture]]. This significant urban shift led to the preservation of numerous Gothic structures, both religious and secular, on both sides of the Warta River, within the area of the former chartered town. The Gothic style in Poznań flourished from approximately the mid-13th century to the end of the 15th century. 

Notable Gothic sites in the older, right-bank part of the city include:<ref name="gothic">{{Cite book |url=http://www.turystykakulturowa.org/pdf/2009_08_01.pdf |title=Architektura i sztuka gotycka w Poznaniu w aspekcie turystyki kulturowej. |publisher=Turystyka Kulturowa|access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>
*Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary (in summo) – erected on the site of a former princely palatium, this church originally housed a chapel founded around 965. The present structure was developed in several phases, with the nave constructed in the first half of the 15th century.
*[[Church of Saint John of Jerusalem outside the walls]] – built by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, it is among the earliest brick churches in Poland.
*Church of St. Margaret – dating from the late 12th century, this church served the religious needs of Śródka, then the most populous area of the Poznań settlement complex. The Baroque interior, largely created in the 17th century, harmonizes with the Gothic architecture.
*[[Poznań Cathedral|Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul]] on [[Ostrów Tumski, Poznań|Ostrów Tumski]] – as the most significant Catholic church in Poznań, this 14th-century cathedral has undergone multiple reconstructions, including a post-World War II regothicization.
[[File:Katerda noc (cropped)2.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral and Church of Holy Virgin Mary on the left.]]

In the left-bank part of the city, the most prominent Gothic monuments include:<ref name="gothic"/>
*[[Church of St. Adalbert, Poznań|Church of St. Adalbert]] – a three-nave pseudo-basilica, built on a rectangular trapezoidal plan, located on St. Adalbert's Hill.
*Church of [[Mary Help of Christians|Our Lady Help of Christians]] and [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian Monastery]] – inside, above the presbytery, a unique type of Gothic rib vaulting, known as the Piast vault, can be found, while the northern nave features a star vault.
*Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Our Lady of Consolation – the oldest surviving church on the left bank of Warta.
*Church of St. Martin – likely constructed by Duke [[Przemysł I of Greater Poland|Przemysł I]] in 1240.
*Church of Corpus Christi and former [[Carmelites|Carmelite Monastery]] – the largest Gothic church in Poznań after the cathedral, this site was a major pilgrimage destination in the Middle Ages. The current form of the church and monastery resulted from reconstruction work between 1465 and 1470.

===Renaissance and Baroque===
The introduction of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture]] to Poznań resulted in the construction of many grand buildings. Noteworthy among these is the Town Hall, an exemplary piece of Renaissance architecture in Poland. The [[Poznań Town Hall|Town Hall]] underwent a significant reconstruction in the mid-16th century, after a fire in 1536. The city authorities entrusted the reconstruction to Giovanni Battista Quadro from [[Lugano]] in 1550. He expanded the building westward by approximately 11 meters and added an additional floor. The reconstruction was completed in 1560. The Renaissance Town Hall is characterized by its rectangular plan, three-story [[loggia]] on the facade, and three polygonal [[Turret (architecture)|turrets]]. The central turret houses a clock mechanism featuring goats, a popular attraction in Poznań since 1551. The attic [[frieze]] depicts [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonian kings]], while the blind arcades feature rulers from the [[Piast dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Architektura. Ratusz - Muzeum Poznania|url=https://mnp.art.pl/profile/architektura-ratusz-muzeum-poznania |publisher=Muzeum Narodowe w Poznaiu |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

From the Baroque period, the Poznań Fara or Collegiate Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, St. Mary Magdalene, and St. Stanislaus Bishop stands out as one of the most significant Baroque structures in Poland. The construction of this church began in the mid-17th century under the guidance of prominent Baroque architects such as Giovanni Catenazzi, Tomasz Poncino, and Pompeo Ferrari. The church was finally consecrated in 1705, although it was not fully completed at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perła poznańskiego baroku|url=https://poznanskiehistorie.blogspot.com/2011/06/pera-poznanskiego-baroku.html |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref> 

Other significant examples of Baroque architecture include the Jesuit College, the Basilica of St. Joseph and the Carmelite Monastery, the Church of St. Francis Seraph, commonly known as the Bernardine Church, and the Church of St. Casimir.

===Art Nouveau===
[[File:Chełmońskiego Poznań.jpg|thumb|left|Johow-Gelände, a housing estate implemented according to an urban planning scheme by Max Johow.]]
The early 20th-century expansion of Poznań to include [[Jeżyce]], [[Wilda (Poznań)|Wilda]], and Łazarz facilitated the development of new architectural spaces. The demolition of the city's fortifications also allowed for the construction of permanent buildings on former fortress grounds. During this period, numerous new urban developments and residential complexes were established.<ref name="sec">{{cite web |title=Szlakiem poznańskiej secesji|url=https://www.poznan.pl/mim/turystyka/-,p,661,22074,24139.html |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

One of them is the so-called Johow-Gelände in the Łazarz district, based on an urban concept by Max Johow, one of the leading architects in Poznań at the beginning of the 20th century. The tenement houses, built in a dense layout without backyards, were preceded by front gardens and, in addition to the high standard of the apartments, also impressed with richly decorated entrance halls and varied building facades. Numerous [[Art Nouveau]] tenement houses can also be found on neighboring streets such as Matejki, Wyspiańskiego, and Małeckiego.<ref name="sec"/>

[[File:Poznan Wolnosci 14 2012.jpg|thumb|Art Nouveau tenement house at 14 Wolności Square.]]
In the early 20th century, many residential developments also emerged in the [[Jeżyce, Poznań|Jeżyce]] district, including a complex of villa-style tenements on Roosevelta Street, designed by the architectural firm of Herman Böhmer and Paul Preul for the German Civil Servants' Housing Cooperative. Particularly noteworthy are the wrought iron grilles at 5 Roosevelta Street and the oversized bas-relief of a naked woman supporting the balcony on the facade of building number 4. Nearby there is also the New Theatre, constructed in 1906, designed by the same architects, which facade design reflects Art Nouveau typical of the German region, featuring geometric forms with varied colors and textures. Similar architecture can be found in the central part of Jeżyce, along streets such as Dąbrowskiego, Kraszewskiego, Mickiewicza, Prusa, and Słowackiego.<ref name="sec"/>

Among the notable [[Art Nouveau]] structures are Oskar Hoffman's tenement house at 69 Święta Marcin Street or tenement house at 14 Wolności Square.<ref name="sec"/>

===Imperial District===
[[File:Zamek Cesarski 3.jpg|thumb|[[Imperial Castle, Poznań|Imperial Castle]]]]
The Imperial District, also known as the Imperial Forum, was constructed as a prestigious area of Poznań in the early 20th century. The district's creation was driven by the need to improve the city's spatial development, which had been hindered by existing fortifications. In 1902, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] decided to abandon the concept of [[Poznań Fortress|Poznań as a fortress city]] and to redevelop it in a residential style. In 1903, architect [[Josef Stübben]] presented a plan for the construction of a new district in the area of the demolished Berlin Gate (located at the intersection of today's [[Święty Marcin]] and Kościuszki streets), which was realized between 1904 and 1910.<ref name="imp1">{{cite web |title=Dzielnica Cesarska 1900–1989, Kolekcja pocztówek Romana Trojanowicza i Damiana Giełdy|url=https://cyryl.poznan.pl/kolekcja/dzielnica-cesarska-i-okolice-1900-1989-kolekcja-pocztowek-romana-trojanowicza/ |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

The central point of this district is the [[Imperial Castle, Poznań|Imperial Castle]], built between 1905 and 1910 for [[Wilhelm II]]. Over the years, the Castle's purpose has evolved. During the interwar period, university lectures were held in its halls, during [[World War II]], the building was adapted to serve as [[Hitler]]'s headquarters, and since the 1960s, it has functioned as a cultural center. Inside, one can find the Pałacowe Cinema, a modern concert hall, exhibition spaces, a library, a bookstore, a café, educational rooms, and areas for visitors to explore the castle's historical rooms.<ref name="imp2">{{cite web |title=Dzielnica Cesarska|url=https://visitpoznan.info/poznan/atrakcje-turystyczne/dzielnica-cesarska/|access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

The heart of the district is [[Adam Mickiewicz]] Square, featuring a monument to the poet. At the boundary of the square and Adam Mickiewicz Park there is a [[Monument to the Victims of June 1956|monument commemorating the Victims of June 1956]]. The district's buildings are located around the square and along [[Święty Marcin]] and Fredry streets.<ref name="imp2"/>

In addition to the Imperial Castle, the most important buildings in the Imperial District include:
The Municipal Theater – now the Grand Theater, 1910, architect [[Max Littmann]] – inspired by the [[Villa Rotonda]] in [[Vicenza]],
* Collegium Maius (formerly the [[Prussian Settlement Commission|Colonization Commission]]), 1908-1910, with a monument to the founder of the Polish university, Professor Heliodor Święcicki, in front of the building,
* Adolf Landsberg's Villa, 1911,
* Institute of Hygiene, 1912,
* Collegium Minus, 1905-1910,
* Music Academy (formerly the Evangelical House – Evangelisches Vereinhaus), 1907–1908,
* Collegium Iuridicum (formerly the Raiffeisen Cooperative Bank), 1907
* [[Poznań Philharmonic]], 1910,
* Post Office Directorate, 1910.

To the west, the district is enclosed by a semicircular line of parks that were created on the site of the 19th-century fortifications of [[Poznań Fortress]]. In the following years, an informal university district developed to the south of the Imperial District, featuring buildings of the Music Academy, the [[Poznań University of Economics and Business|University of Economics]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz University]].<ref name="imp2"/>

===Modernism===
[[Modern architecture]] in Poznań began to emerge in the 1930s with buildings like the ZUS office on Dąbrowskiego Street, continuing through the 1980s. The Okrąglak, constructed between 1949 and 1954, is a prominent example, designed by architect Marek Leykam. Built on a circular plan using prefabricated elements, its nine-story cylindrical structure features a flat roof with a central skylight and a surrounding terrace. The facade, without a dominant elevation, is characterized by a glass surface divided by rectangular window openings and vertical "razor blade" partitions.<ref name="modern">{{cite web |title=Szlakiem modernizmu|url=https://www.poznan.pl/mim/turystyka/-,p,661,22074,22079.html |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

Other examples of modernist architecture in Poznań include the Alfa Towers on [[Święty Marcin]] and the Poznan University of Physical Education building on Królowej Jadwigi Street. Another important modernist monument is the Arena Hall, which was built in 1974 and was inspired by the shape of the Palazzetto dello Sport, a hall constructed in Rome several years earlier.<ref name="modern"/>

===Contemporary Architecture===
[[File:Andersia Silver (cropped).jpg|thumb|Office buildings near Stary Browar.]]
The development of [[postmodernism]] in Poznań began at the start of the 21st century, primarily influencing office architecture. One of the most acclaimed buildings, which has received numerous awards, is [[Bałtyk]] — a 16-story office tower located near Rondo Kaponiera. This project marked the first realization in Poland by one of the world's most renowned architectural firms, [[MVRDV]]. The unique form of the building gives it a different appearance from every angle — it appears to expand or contract, simultaneously slender and expansive. Other notable examples of modern architecture include the [[Porta Posnania]], the [[Andersia Tower|Andersia office complex]], Pixel, and the Nowy Rynek office complex.<ref name="cont">{{cite web |title=Poznań TOP 10 - nowoczesna architektura w Poznaniu|url=https://www.bryla.pl/bryla/56,85301,10360771,Poznan_TOP_10___przewodnik_architektoniczny.html |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

A significant trend in the city's architecture is the modernization of historical buildings and their integration with contemporary elements, exemplified by [[Stary Browar]]. This complex was developed on the site of the 19th-century Hugger Brewery. The shopping center largely consists of new forms, styled to resemble historical ones and based on the iconography of 19th-century industrial architecture.<ref name="cont"/>

==Culture and heritage==
[[File:Ayuntamiento, Poznan, Polonia, 2019-12-18, DD 07-09 HDR.jpg|thumb|right|The Renaissance [[Poznań Town Hall|Town Hall]] (1560, originally built in the late 13th century) now houses a museum.]]

Poznań possesses many historic buildings and heritage sites, mostly concentrated around the [[Poznań Old Town|Old Town]] and other parts of the city centre. Many of these lie on the tourist [[Poznań Royal-Imperial Route|Royal-Imperial Route]] – a walk leading through the most important parts of the city showing its history, culture and identity. Parts of the city centre are listed as one of Poland's official national [[List of Historical Monuments (Poland)|historic monuments]], as designated 28 November 2008, along with other portions of the city's historic core.

Apart from traditional theatres with a long history such as ''[[Grand Theatre, Poznań|Teatr Wielki]]'', ''[[Polish Theatre in Poznań|Teatr Polski]]'', ''Teatr Nowy'', and others like ''Teatr Animacji'', ''Teatr Muzyczny'' and Polish Dance Theatre, Poznań is also home to a growing number of different kind of [[Fringe theatre|alternative theatre]] groups. It is believed that even up to 30 more or less known groups may work in the city, and thus, the city has recently become a new Polish off-theatre performance centre.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rogulska |first=Anna |date=2016-09-28 |title=Poznań jest kopalnią alternatywy.

==Population==
[[File:Poznań population pyramid.svg|thumb|Poznań population pyramid in 2021]]
{{Main|Historical population of Poznań|Demographics of Poland}}
In 1600, approximately 20,000 inhabitants resided in the whole Poznań conurbation. By 1732 the population had dropped to 4,000 due to wars, floods and [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Historically, its growth rate was high throughout the 19th and 20th centuries; in the year 1900 approximately 110,000 people were registered as residents and by 1939 there was already 274,155 people. The population of Poznań has declined steadily since 1990, when it reached a maximum of 590,101. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, is caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper. In 2020, Poznań had 532,048 registered inhabitants being the fifth most populous town in Poland, while the metropolitan area had a population of about 1,000,000 people. The city's population density was {{convert|5,300|/mi2|/km2|disp=preunit|people&nbsp;|people}}.

Contemporary Poznań has one of the highest concentration of foreigners in Poland alongside [[Warsaw]] and [[Wrocław]]; a significant majority are migrant workers from [[Ukraine]]; others came from [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Serbia]]. No exact statistic exists on the number of temporary residents from abroad. Many are students studying at Poznań's schools and institutions of higher learning.

{{main|List of universities and colleges in Poznań}}
Poznań is one of the four largest academic centres in Poland. The number of students in the city is about 140,000, which ranks it the third or fourth after [[Warsaw]] and [[Kraków]] and about equal to [[Wrocław]] in student population. Every one in four inhabitants of Poznań is a student. Since Poznań is smaller than Warsaw or Kraków still having a very large number of students it makes the city even more vibrant and dense academic hub than both former and current capital of Poland – Kraków and Warsaw respectively. Poznań with its almost 30 universities and colleges has the second richest educational offering in the country after Warsaw.

===Public universities===
The city has eight state-owned universities.

The majority of faculties are already open, although a few more facilities will be constructed. The campus infrastructure belongs to the most impressive among Polish universities. Also, there are plans for "Uniwersytecki Park Historii Ziemii" (Earth History Park), one of the reason for the park construction is a "[[Morasko meteorite nature reserve]]" situated close by, it is one of the rare sites of Europe where a number of meteorites fell and some traces may be still seen.

Lech plays at the [[Stadion Poznań|Municipal Stadium]], which hosted the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 European Championship]] group stages as well as the opening game and the final of the [[2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship|2006 under-19 Euro Championship]]. Warta usually plays at the small [[Stadion Miejski Warty (Poznań)|Dębińska Road Stadium]], a former training ground for [[Stadion Edmunda Szyca|Edmund Szyc Stadium]], however, since the latter fell into disrepair in 1998 and was sold in 2001, it became the team's main ground. The club was planning to rebuild Szyc Stadium with historical 60,000-seat capacity.<ref>{{cite web |last=Polska |first=Grupa Wirtualna |title=Widok jak z horroru w samym centrum miasta.

The artificial [[Lake Malta|Malta lake]], which was formed in 1952 and is about {{Convert|2.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, hosted the [[2009 World Rowing Championships]] and some regattas of the [[World Rowing Cup]]. It also held the [[ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships]] in [[1990 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|1990]], [[2001 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2001]], and [[2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2010]].

''Termy Maltańskie'', big water sports and recreation complex featuring [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], is located at the north bank of the lake. A 50-metre pool can be divided into two 25-metre pools. The other pool with a diving tower also fulfils all requirements necessary for organizing sports competitions. ''Termy Maltańskie'' consists of as many as 18 sports and recreational swimming pools with a total water surface area of {{Convert|5000|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} as well as many other attractions such as different kind of saunas and spa, among others. The complex uses natural geothermal waters drawn nearby from a depth of {{Convert|1306|m|ft}} and saturated with beneficial minerals and elements, for some of the swimming pools.

At the south bank of the lake, Malta-Ski [[Dry slope skiing|year-round skiing complex]] is situated, and is hosting minor sport competitions, equipped with a [[toboggan run]] and a [[minigolf]] course. There is also a roller rink with a [[roller skating]] club nearby.

Since 2000, the city has been the host of the [[Poznań Marathon]], one of the largest such races in the country.

Poznań's multi-purpose sports and entertainment indoor [[arena]] is simply called ''[[Hala Arena|Arena]]''. Located west of city centre and built in 1974, it originally seated about 5,500 people and is used for many different sports and cultural events such as [[volleyball]] and concerts, among others. The facility has since been modernized, including lowering the level of the ground floor to increase arena capacity to about 9,200. Poznań has experience as a host for international sporting events such as the [[2009 EuroBasket]].<ref>[https://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/sid/6328/_/index.html 2009 EuroBasket], ARCHIVE.FIBA.com, Retrieved 5 June 2016.</ref>

The city has the largest motorsport race track in Poland, [[Tor Poznań]], located at the west city's suburbs in [[Przeźmierowo]].

Poznań is also considered to be the hotbed of Polish [[field hockey]], with several top teams of [[Warta Poznań (field hockey)|Warta Poznań]], [[Grunwald Poznań (sports club)|Grunwald Poznań]] – multi-sport club which also has [[Shooting sports|shooting]], [[wrestling]], [[team handball|handball]] and [[tennis]] sections, [[Pocztowiec Poznań]], and [[AZS AWF Poznań]] – an academic club which also fields professional teams in women's [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]]. Other clubs include: [[Posnania Poznań]] – one of the best [[rugby union]] teams in the country, [[Polonia Poznań]] – formerly a multi-sport club achieving many successes in rugby with only a football section remaining, [[KKS Wiara Lecha]] – football club formed by the supporters of Lech Poznań, and [[Odlew Poznań]] – arguably the most famous amateur club in the country due to their extensive media coverage and humorous exploits. There are also numerous [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[synchronised swimming]] clubs, as well as numerous less notable amateur football teams.

The [[E11 European long distance path]] for hikers passes through Poznań.

In Poznań, various Police units operate across different administrative levels to ensure public safety. At the regional level, the Voivodship Police Headquarters in Poznań (Komenda Wojewódzka Policji w Poznaniu, KWP) coordinates police activities across the entire Greater Poland Voivodeship. Within the city, the key role is played by the Municipal Police Headquarters in Poznań (Komenda Miejska Policji w Poznaniu, KMP), responsible for maintaining order and safety. KMP supervises several police stations located in different districts:<ref name="komenda">{{cite web |title=KOmisariaty podległe KM|url=https://poznan.policja.gov.pl/w21/poznanska-policja/komisariaty-podlegle-km/dane-teleadresowe?page=0|access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref>

All these units work closely together to effectively protect Poznań's residents. Since September 2016, the National Safety Threat Map (Krajowa Mapa Zagrożeń Bezpieczeństwa) has been active in the area covered by the Poznań Municipal Police Headquarters.

Since the end of the [[People's Republic of Poland|communist era]] in 1989, city investments into transportation have been mostly into public transport. While the number of cars since 1989 has at least doubled, municipal policy concentrated on improving public transport, which mostly consists of trams and both urban and suburban buses. New tram lines are planned and built, including [[Poznań Fast Tram|''Pestka'' Fast Tram]] sections, and the rolling stock is being replaced for modern low-floor vehicles such as [[Solaris Tramino]], [[Siemens Combino]] and [[Moderus Gamma]] trams, and buses such as [[Solaris Urbino]].

Paid parking zones in the city centre were established, and Park & Ride car parks have been built to encourage commuters to leave their car on the outskirts of the city and continue their journey by public transport, as well as to allow safe and legal parking outside the city centre. Limiting car access to the strict centre actually increased the level of ridership.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}
