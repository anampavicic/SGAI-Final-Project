'''Nakhon Si Thammarat''' ({{langx|th|นครศรีธรรมราช}}, {{IPA|th|ná(ʔ).kʰɔ̄ːn sǐː tʰām.mā.râːt|pron}}; from Pali ''Nagara Sri Dhammaraja'') is a city municipality (''[[thesaban nakhon]]'') located in Mueang Nakhon Si Thammarat, the capital of Nakhon Si Thammarat Province. Nakhon Si Thammarat Province is situated in the South of Thailand. It is about {{convert|610|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Bangkok]], on the east coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. The city was the administrative centre of Southern Thailand during most of its history. Originally, a coastal city, silting moved the coastline away from the city. The city has a much larger north to south extension than west to east, which dates back to its original location on a flood-save dune. The modern city centre on the train station is north of Old Town. As of 2019, the city had a population of 102,152.<ref name="TDD"/>

==Toponymy==
[[Thai honorifics#Si.2FSri|Thai honorific ''Sri'' or ''Si'']] is from [[Sanskrit]] [[Sri]]; {{lang|th-Latn|Thamma}}, from [[Dharma]]; {{lang|th-Latn|rat}}, from [[Raja]]. ''Dhammaraja'' means "righteous ruler", an important [[Theravada]] concept.

==History==
{{further|Chi Tu|Tambralinga|Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom}}
Nakhon Si Thammarat is one of the oldest cities in Thailand with a rich history. The earliest settlement in the vicinity of the city was Tha Rua, about ten kilometers south of the modern city, where ceramics from the [[Song dynasty]]<ref name="Munro-Hay">{{cite book |last1=Munro-Hay |first1=Stuart C. |title=Nakhon Sri Thammarat: The Archeology, History and Legends of a Southern Thai Town |date=2001 |publisher=White Lotus Press}}</ref> were found dated to the twelfth century.<ref name="Jacq-Hergoualc’h">{{cite book |last1=Jacq-Hergoualc’h |first1=Michel |title=The Malay Peninsula: Crossroads of the Maritime Silk Road (100 BC - 1300 AD) |date=24 December 2018 |publisher=BRILL}}</ref> The settlement then moved to Muang Phra Wieng, which was associated with the [[Tambralinga|Tambralinga Kingdom]], four kilometers to the south. An inscription was found at Wat Sema Muang that bore: The king of [[Srivijaya]] "had established a foothold on the [[Malay Peninsula]] at Ligor" by 775, where he "built various edifices, including a sanctuary dedicated to the [[Buddha]] and to the [[Bodhisattva]]s [[Padmapani]] and [[Vajrapani]]."<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|author-link= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of south-east Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}</ref>{{rp|84–85,91}} Tambralinga, whose name means "Red [[Linga]]" (from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''tām(b)ra'' "[[copper]]" and ''lingam'') and may relate to Chinese ''Tan Ma Ling'' (單馬令), was one of the polities under [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayanist]] Srivijaya thalassocracy. 

The ''Chronicles of Nakorn Si Thammarat'', composed in the seventeenth century, attributed the foundation of current city of Nakhon Si Thammarat to King Sri Thammasok in the thirteenth century. An inscription found at Chaiya stated that King Sri Thammasok ruled Tambralinga in 1231. King Sri Thammasok constructed [[Wat Phra Mahathat]] and introduced Singhalese [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]] held authorities over "twelve cities" that extended from [[Chumphon]] to the north and [[Pahang]] to the south.<ref name="Montesano">{{cite book |last1=Montesano |first1=Michael John |title=Thai South and Malay North: Ethnic Interactions on a Plural Peninsula |date=2008 |publisher=NUS Press}}</ref> The [[Ram Khamhaeng Inscription|Ramkamhaeng Stele]] of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] first mentioned "Nakhon Si Thammarat" in 1292, which means "The City of King Sri Thammasok" or "The City of the Virtuous king". The Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom ended and the city perished in the fourteenth century. The ruler of [[Phetchaburi]] known as Phra Phanom Thale sent his son Phra Phanom Wang to re-establish the city and rule.<ref name="Montesano" /> Nakhon Si Thammarat then came under the influence of Central Siamese [[Kingdom of Ayutthaya]] under the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala system]].

Nakhon Si Thammarat was further incorporated into Ayutthaya, who appointed governors to the city, through centralization under [[Borommatrailokkanat|King Trailokanat]] in the fifteenth century. Nakhon Si Thammarat served as the main seat of Siamese authority over Southern Thailand and the Malay Peninsula, becoming ''Muang Ek'' or first-level city. Nakhon Si Thammarat was known of Western sources as "Ligor". [[Yamada Nagamasa]], the Japanese adventurer, was appointed as the governor of Ligor in 1629. In the 1680s, during the reign of King [[Narai]], M. de Lamare the French architect renovated the city walls.<ref name="Munro-Hay" /> After the [[Siamese revolution of 1688]], the governor of Ligor rebelled against the new King [[Phetracha]]. King Phetracha sent troops to put down rebels in Ligor in 1692. The powers of the governors of Ligor was then curbed and Ligor was put under the authority of ''Samuha Kalahom'' the Prime Minister of Southern Siam.

After the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767)|Fall of Ayutthaya]] in 1767, [[Chaophraya Nakhon (Nu)|Phra Palat Nu]] the vice-governor of Ligor established himself as the local warlord and ruler over Southern Thailand. [[King Taksin]] of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] marched south to subjugate Phra Palat Nu or ''Chao Phraya'' Nakhon Nu in 1769. ''Chao Phraya'' Nakhon Nu was taken to Thonburi but King Taksin re-installed Nakhon Nu as a [[tributary state|tributary ruler]] of Ligor in 1776. King [[Rama I]] re-established the governorship of Ligor in 1784 and it ceded to be a tributary kingdom. During the [[Burmese-Siamese War (1785-1786)|Burmese-Siamese War]] in 1786, the city of Ligor was sacked by the invading Burmese. During the tenure of ''Chao Phraya'' [[Noi Na Nagara|Nakhon Noi]] (1811–1838), known in British sources as the "Raja of Ligor", Ligor retained a relative autonomy<ref name="Keat">{{cite book |last1=Keat |first1=Gin Ooi |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor |date=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO}}</ref> and emerged as the political and cultural center of Southern Siam. [[John Bowring|Sir John Bowring]] mentioned in 1857 that the city of Ligor had the population of 12,000 people,<ref>{{Cite book |last=John Bowring |title=The Kingdom and People of Siam with a Narrative of the Mission to that Country in 1855 |publisher=J. W. Parker |year=1857}}</ref> perhaps the largest city in southern Siam before being surpassed by [[Surat Thani]] and [[Hatyai]] in modern times.

After Nakhon Noi, his son and grandson became respective governors of Nakhon Si Thammarat. During the reforms of [[King Chulalongkorn]], the traditional governorship of Ligor was abolished and the city was incorporated into the [[Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat]] 1896. When the [[monthon]] system was abolished in 1932, the town became a provincial capital.

==Climate==
Nakhon Si Thammarat has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af''). The city is more subject to the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] than the [[trade wind]]s but experiences a few [[cyclone]]s so is not purely equatorial but subequatorial. Temperatures remain very warm to hot throughout the year. While some rain falls in all months, it is drier in February and March when about {{convert|90|mm|in}} of rain falls in each month, and wetter in October to December when very heavy rain may fall; November sees {{convert|631|mm|in}} of rain on average each year.

[[File:Nakhon Si Thammarat Chedi Phra Baromathat.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Chedi Phra Baromathat, constructed by King Sri Thammasok of [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]] in the thirteenth century.]]
[[Wat]] Phra Mahathat [[Vihara|Vihaan]] (Thai วัดพระมหาธาตุวรมหาวิหาร) is the most important temple of Nakhon Si Thammarat and southern Thailand. It was constructed at the time of the founding of the town, and contains a tooth [[relic]] of Buddha. The 78 m high [[stupa|chedi]] is surrounded by 173 smaller ones. While the chedi is now in [[Sri Lanka]]n style, it is said to be built on top of an earlier [[Srivijaya]] style chedi. The chedi was renovated in early 2009 and now appears like new.

At the base of the chedi is a gallery named ''Viharn Tap Kaset'', decorated with many Buddha statues and elephant heads emerging from the chedi. ''Viharn Phra Song Ma'' are the buildings which contain the staircase which leads to a walkway around the chedi above the gallery. At the bottom of the staircase are demon giants ([[Yaksha|yak]]) as guardians. Adjoining to the north is the ''Viharn Kien'', which contains a small temple museum.

===City wall===
The city chronicle mentions a fortification when the town was refounded in 1278. Restorations were recorded at the time of King [[Ramesuan (king of Ayutthaya)|Ramesuan]] (14th century), as well as King [[Narai]] (1686). The latter was supported by the French engineer M. de la Mare.

The walls spread 456 m from east to west, and 2238 m north to south, thus enclosing an area of about one square kilometre. The northern wall had only one gate, called ''Prathu Chai Nua'' or ''Prathu Chai Sak''. The southern wall had only one gate. To the east there were three gates, which connected the town with the sea. To the west were five gates. Today only the northern gate still exists, together with a short stretch of the northern city wall.
