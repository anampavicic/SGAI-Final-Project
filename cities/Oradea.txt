The [[county seat|seat]] of [[Bihor County]], Oradea is one of the most important economic, social and cultural centers in the western part of Romania. The city is located in the north-west of the country, nestled between hills on the [[Crișana]] plain and situated on the banks of the river [[Crișul Repede]] that divides the city into almost equal halves.

Located about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Borș, Bihor|Borș]], one of the most important crossing points on Romania's border with [[Hungary]], Oradea ranks [[List of cities and towns in Romania|ninth among most populated]] Romanian cities (as of the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]]).<ref name="RPL2021"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-26058967-harta-interactiva-populatia-romaniei-fiecare-localitate-din-tara-recensamantul-2021-2011-cele-mai-mari-creseri-cele-mai-drastice-scaderi.htm|title=Populația României în fiecare localitate din țară - Recensământul 2021 vs. 2011|publisher=hotnews.ro|language=ro|date=2 February 2023}}</ref> It covers an area of {{convert|11556|ha}}, in an area of contact between the extensions of the [[Apuseni Mountains]] and the Crișana-Banat extended plain.

Besides its status as an economic hub, Oradea boasts a rich [[Art Nouveau]] architectural heritage and is a member of the [[Réseau Art Nouveau Network]] and the Art Nouveau European Route.

==Name==
The [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name ''Oradea'' originates from the city's [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name. In Hungarian, it is called ''Nagyvárad'', or colloquially ''Várad'', the latter being the origin of the Romanian name.

"[[wikt:nagy#Hungarian|Nagy]]" means ''great'' or ''large'' in Hungarian, and it helped to differentiate the town from [[Kisvárda]], a town in [[Hungary]], with "[[wikt:kis#Hungarian|kis]]" meaning ''little''. "[[wikt:vár#Hungarian|Vár]]" means ''[[castle]]'' or ''[[citadel]]'', and "[[wikt:-ad#Hungarian|-ad]]" is a [[suffix]] used for settlement names. <ref>https://www.arcanum.com/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Lexikonok-a-magyar-nyelv-ertelmezo-szotara-1BE8B/k-359B8/kicsinyito-35CF5/ Retrieved: 2023.09.10</ref>

The city also has a [[German language|German]] name, ''Großwardein'', as well as a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] one derived from it, גרױסװאַרדײן ''Groysvardeyn''. In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the city was historically known as ''Varat'' or ''Varad''.
Other names include [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Varadinum'' as well as the historical [[Italian language|Italian]] name of ''Gran Varadino''.<ref name=Agostini>''Atlas. L'atlante geografico de Agostini'' [dubious, implausible title], Istituto geografico de Agostini, Novara 1993, p. 109.</ref><ref name=Ademollo>Map of Romania in Ademollo, Umberto: ''Gli Stati d'Europa dopo la Grande Guerra'' ["The States of Europe after the Great War"], in "Le Vie d'Italia e del Mondo" ["The Roads of Italy and the World"] series, year I, number 2 (February 1933-XI), p. 143</ref>

Some archaic Romanian names of the city are ''Oradia'', ''Oradea Mare'' ("Great Oradea"), ''Varadia Mare'' ("Great Varadia") and ''Urbea Mare'' ("the Grand City").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oradeainimagini.ro/istoria-orasului/ |title=Oradea în Imagini – Istoria Orasului |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=oradeainimagini.ro |access-date=7 May 2020}}</ref>

==Geography==
The city lies at the meeting point of the Crișana plain and the [[Crișul Repede]]'s basin. It is situated {{convert|126|m|abbr=off}} above sea level, surrounded on the north-eastern part by the hills of Oradea, part of the Șes hills. The main part of the settlement is situated on the floodplain and on the terraces situated down the river Crișul Repede. Oradea is famous for its thermal springs. The river Crișul Repede crosses the city right through the center, providing it with a picturesque beauty. Its flow depends on the season; the dykes near [[Tileagd]] have partly controlled it since they were built in the early 1980s.

===Climate===
Oradea has a warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with oceanic influences. The city's topo-climatic action is determined by the prevailing Western winds. Summers are long and hot with cool nights. Winters are short and moderately cold.

Annual average temperature is {{convert|10.4|°C|°F}}. In July, the average is about {{convert|21|°C|°F}}, while in January, the average is {{convert|-1.9|°C|°F}}. Rainfall is sufficient for the woods and vegetation of the zone, registering an annual average of about {{convert|781|mm|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Check Forecast for Oradea Average Rainfall by Month|url=https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-precipitation-Rainfall,Oradea,Romania}}</ref> Rainfall is variably distributed throughout the year, with a maximum in June and a minimum in the late Autumn and Winter months of the year.<div style="width:75%">

While modern Oradea is first mentioned in 1113, under the [[Latin]] name "Varadinum" in a diploma belonging to [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Zobor Abbey]] – Bishop Sixtus Varadiensis and Saul de Bychar are mentioned in the document – recent archaeological findings, in and around the city, provide evidence of a more or less continuous habitation since the Neolithic age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/stiinta/descoperiri-importante-in-oradea-urme-care-arata-ca-zona-era-locuita-inca-de-acum-7-000-de-ani.html|title=Descoperire importantă la Oradea|publisher=[[Pro TV]]|date=11 October 2017|language=ro}}</ref> The [[Dacians]] and [[Boii|Celts]] also inhabited the region. After the conquest of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a presence in the area, most notably in the Salca district of the city and modern day [[Băile Felix]].<ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|author1=Cataldi Raffaele |author2=Hodgson Susan |author3=Lund John |title=Stories from a Heated Earth, Our Geothermal Heritage|year=1999|publisher=Geothermal Resources Council|page=245|isbn=0934412197}}</ref><ref>E.

[[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 1976.</ref> According to the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'', a Hungarian chronicle written after 1150 by an unidentified author, referred to as [[Anonymus (notary of Béla III)|Anonymus]], the region was ruled by [[Menumorut]] at the end of the 9th and beginning of the 10th centuries, until the Hungarian land-taking. Its citadel was centred at Biharea.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Oradea Oradea on Britannica]</ref> Historians debate whether Menumorut was a historical ruler or a legendary character. According to Anonymus, Menumorut's duchy was populated primarily with [[Khazars]] and [[Székelys]], and he acknowledged the [[suzerainty]] of the (unnamed) ruling [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] at the time.

In the 11th century, [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. King Ladislaus I]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] founded a [[Diocese|bishopric]] settlement near the city of Oradea, the present [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea]].

([[Chronicon Pictum]], 1358)]]
The [[Regestrum Varadinense]] is a record of the trials that took place between 1208 and 1235 containing 711 place-names and 2500 personal names. The city flourished both economically and culturally during the 13th century as part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. It was at this time that the [[Citadel]] of Oradea, first mentioned in 1241 during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]], was first built. The fortress would be destroyed and rebuilt several times over the course of the following centuries. The 14th and 15th centuries would prove to be of the most prosperous periods in the city's history up to that point. Many works of art would be added to the city, including statues of Saints Stephen, Emeric, and Ladislaus (before 1372) and the [[equestrian sculpture]] of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. King Ladislaus I]] (1390) were erected in Oradea. The fabled statue of St. Ladislaus was the first proto-renaissance public square equestrian monument in Europe. Bishop Andreas Báthori (1329–1345) rebuilt the Cathedral in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. From that [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] dates also the Hermes, now preserved at [[Győr]], which contains the [[Ladislaus_I_of_Hungary#Herma_of_King_Saint_Ladislaus_and_Genetics|skull of St. Ladislaus]], and which is a masterpiece of the Hungarian goldsmith's art.

It was at this time that astronomer [[Georg von Peuerbach]] wrote his ''Tabula Varadiensis'', published posthumously in 1464, at (?) the Observatory of Varadinum, establishing the city's observatory as the Earth's point of reference and prime meridian.

In 1474, the city was besieged by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who took advantage of the absence of [[Matthias Corvinus]] from the country. The city was severely damaged, but the king later repopulated it with inhabitants from other parts of Hungary whom he exempted from taxes, a policy reinforced by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.oradea.ro/pagina/istoria-orasului-oradea | title=Istoria orașului Oradea }}</ref>

The Peace of Várad was concluded between [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]] and [[John Zápolya]] here on 4 February 1538, in which they mutually recognized each other as legitimate monarchs. After the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion of Hungary]], in the 16th century, the city became a constant point of contention between the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. After the 1570 [[Treaty of Speyer (1570)|Treaty of Speyer]], parts of Crișana, including Oradea, became part of the newly formed Principality of Transylvania, a successor state of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom.

The Ottomans laid siege to the city in 1598, however the siege failed. After the [[Treaty of Vienna (1606)]], the city was permanently incorporated in the Principality of Transylvania by imperial decree.

[[File:Fn braun-varadinum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Varadinum (Oradea) in a 1617 engraving by Braun & Hogenberg]]

As a result of [[Gyorgy Rakoczi II]]'s, at the time the [[Prince of Transylvania]], failed attempt to gain the throne of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] the Ottomans sent yet another punitive expedition against him and his [[Wallachia]]n and [[Moldavia]]n allies, [[Gheorghe Ștefan]] and [[Constantin Șerban]]. In 1660 the Ottomans, with a force of 45,000 men, [[Siege of Nagyvárad (1660)|besieged]] the city for the last time. The 850 defenders managed to hold out for 46 days, but eventually the city fell on 27 August due to internal treachery. The Ottomans designated the city as the capital of the newly formed [[Varat Eyalet|Eyalet of Varat]]. The [[eyalet]] included the sanjaks of "Varat" (Oradea), [[Salonta|Salanta]], [[Debrecen|Debreçin]], [[Nagyhalász|Halmaş]], [[Săcueni|Sengevi]], and [[Balmazújváros|Yapışmaz]]. The siege is described in detail by [[János Szalárdi]] in his contemporary chronicle. Ottoman dominance of the city ended in 1692, when, the Habsburg imperial forces conquered the city after a 14-month siege.

[[File:Oradea 1897.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Map of Oradea in 1897]]

The city had been severely damaged by war, with only 114 houses left, of which only 21 had not been damaged.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lego.rdsor.ro/tont/oradea/rom/istorie/istorie.html | title=Istoria Orasului }}</ref> However, under the Habsburgs' reconstruction, in the 18th century, Oradea entered its golden age. The [[Vienna|Viennese]] engineer Franz Anton Hillebrandt was given the task of planning the city in the [[Baroque]] style and, starting with the year 1752, many of the city's current landmarks were constructed such as the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Mary, Oradea|Roman Catholic Cathedral]], the [[Moon Church]], the State Theatre, and the [[Baroque Palace of Oradea|Baroque Palace]].

The city played a major role in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], being the home of the largest Hungarian arms factory.

After [[World War I]], Oradea passed under Romanian administration during the [[Hungarian–Romanian War]] of 1919, and became a part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] under the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920. In 1925, the status of [[Municipalities of Romania|municipality]] was given to Oradea, dissolving its former civic autonomy. Under the same ordinance, its name was changed from ''Oradea Mare'' ("Great" Oradea) to simply Oradea.

The [[Second Vienna Award]] brokered by Hitler and Mussolini in 1940 allowed Hungary to recover [[Northern Transylvania]], including Oradea, and mass of celebrations welcomed the Hungarian administration.<ref>[http://www.hhrf.org/erdelyinaplo/cikk_nyomtatas.php?id_cikk=10427 A nagyváradi „verőfényes magyar ünnep” (The "shiny Hungarian holiday" in Oradea), Erdélyi Napló, 4 February, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129131644/http://www.hhrf.org/erdelyinaplo/cikk_nyomtatas.php?id_cikk=10427 |date=29 November 2014 }}</ref> On 12 October 1944, Oradea was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Battle of Debrecen]], and reverted to Romanian administration in March 1945. After [[World War II]], Hungary had to relinquish claims to it under the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] concluded on 10 February 1947.

===Jewish community===
:''This section incorporates text from the 1901–1906'' [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', a publication now in the [[public domain]].''
[[File:Sinagoga Neologa din Oradea (2023) - img 22.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Interior of the Neolog Synagogue]]
The ''[[chevra kadisha]]'' ("holy society") was founded in 1735, the first synagogue in 1803, and the first communal school in 1839. <!--Update please: The old Jewish quarter, known as "''[[Katona Város]]''" (Soldier Town), is in the neighborhood of the fort. It still bears its ancient architecture and is still occupied mainly by Jews. The old synagogue remains, though no longer used for worship. The Jewish hospital also stands there.--> Not until the beginning of the 19th century were Jews permitted to do business in any other part of the city, and even then, they were required to return at nightfall to their own quarter. In 1835, permission was granted to live in any part of the city.

The Jewish community of Oradea [[Schism in Hungarian Jewry|became divided]] into [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]]. While the members of the Neolog congregation still retained their membership in the ''chevra kadisha'', they started to use a cemetery of their own in 1899. In the early 20th century, the Jews of Oradea had won prominence in the public life of the city. There were Jewish manufacturers, merchants, lawyers, physicians, and farmers; the chief of police (1902) was a Jew; and in the municipal council, the Jewish element was proportionately represented. The community possessed, in addition to the hospital and ''chevra kadisha'', a Jewish women's association, a grammar school, a trade school for boys and girls, a [[yeshiva]], a [[soup kitchen]], etc.

According to the ''Center for Jewish Art'':

<blockquote>The Oradea Jewish community was once the most active both commercially and culturally in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1944, twenty-five thousand Oradean Jews were deported to concentration camps by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], thus decimating this vital community. Only three hundred Jews reside in Oradea today. In the center of the city, on the river bank and towering over other buildings in the area, is the large Neolog Temple Synagogue built in 1878. The unusual cube-shaped synagogue with its large cupola is one of the largest in Romania. Inside there is a large organ and stucco decorations. In 1891, the Orthodox community also built a complex of buildings including two synagogues and a community center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/CJA/NL14-Romania.htm |title=Uncovering and Documenting Jewish Art and Architecture in Western Romania |access-date=2007-03-05 |date=Summer 1998 |work=Center for Jewish Art |publisher=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208145953/http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/cja/NL14-Romania.htm |archive-date=8 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

In 1944, during the [[Operation Margarethe|occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany]], [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Hungarian authorities]] forced the Jewish inhabitants into the [[Oradea ghetto]] before sending them to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Descendants of the pre-[[Holocaust]] [[Hasidic]] rabbinate in Oradea established a synagogue in the [[Willowbrook, Staten Island|Willowbrook]] area of [[Staten Island]], New York City. The synagogue maintains both a traditional hasidic [[Nusach Sefard]] and a [[Nusach Ashkenaz]] service, the latter of which operates under the name ''Bais Medrash Igud Avreichim of Groisverdain'' (the Yiddish pronunciation of Grosswardein).

As of 2021, there is also a project to build a [[rabbinical seminary]] in Oradea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.g4media.ro/oradea-va-avea-prima-scoala-rabinica-ridicata-in-aceasta-parte-a-europei-dupa-cel-de-al-doilea-razboi-mondial.html|title = Oradea va avea prima școală rabinică ridicată în această parte a Europei după cel de-al Doilea Război Mondial|date = 26 April 2021}}</ref>

==Quarters==
[[File:Oradea Districts EN.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the current 30 districts]]
Before 1848, Oradea was made up of four separate towns: Várad-Újváros (Villa Nova, former Vicus Szombathely), Várad-Olaszi (Villa Latinorum Varadiensium, "olasz" meaning Italian), Várad-Velence (Vicus Venetia), Várad-Váralja (Civitas Waradiensis). The names Vicus [[Venice|Venetia]], Villa [[Latium|Latinorum]], Vicus [[Bologna|Bolognia]], Vicus [[Padua]] and others refer to the French, [[Wallonia|Walloons]] and Italian inhabitants who settled in the 13th century.

Today the city is made up of the following districts called quarters (''cartiere'' in Romanian, ''negyedek'' in Hungarian):

==Economy==
Oradea has long been one of the more prosperous cities in Romania. The per capita GDP of Oradea is approximately 150% of the Romanian average.<ref>[http://www.zmo.ro/movie.html Zona metropolitană Oradea – Prezentare multimedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304180020/http://www.zmo.ro/movie.html |date=4 March 2007 }}</ref> After 1989, due to its base of consumers, Oradea experienced an economic renewal, mostly in the services sector such as trade and tourism.

<!-- [[File:OradeaCity.750px.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Oradea]] City center ]] -->
Oradea has an unemployment rate of 6.0%, slightly lower than the Romanian average but much higher than [[Bihor County]]'s average of around 2%. Oradea produces around 63% of the industrial production of Bihor County, while accounting for 34.5% of the population of the county. Its main industries are furniture, textiles and clothing, footwear, and food processing. Oradea's economy is sustained largely by small and medium business and the property taxes paid by citizens.

In the fiscal year 2012, Oradea had the largest budget in the [[Transylvania]] region, overcoming its neighbour cities, [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Cluj-Napoca]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/locale/topul-bugetelor-locale-din-transilvania-si-banat-253725.html| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120319192435/http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/locale/topul-bugetelor-locale-din-transilvania-si-banat-253725.html| archive-date = 2012-03-19| title = Topul bugetelor locale din Transilvania și Banat|newspaper=[[România liberă]]}} </ref> Some large Romanian companies, such as Adeplast, RCS-RDS, European Drinks, and FrigoExpress are located in Oradea.

Oradea is using [[Geothermal power|geothermal electricity]] from water two kilometers below ground, which provides 7% of the energy for its district heating system. That system serves 70% of the city's population with heat and hot water.<ref name=":42">{{Cite web|title=How to build a cohesive and inclusive Europe|url=https://www.eib.org/en/stories/just-transition-mechanism|access-date=2021-06-07|website=European Investment Bank|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-10|title=Romania's Oradea city starts tender for geothermal district heating|url=https://balkangreenenergynews.com/romanias-oradea-city-starts-tender-for-geothermal-district-heating/|access-date=2021-06-07|publisher=Balkan Green Energy News|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=How a city can benefit from EU funds|url=https://www.eib.org/en/stories/romania-oradea-urban-development|access-date=2021-06-07|publisher=[[European Investment Bank]]|language=en}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:ULF in Oradea.jpg|thumb|Oradea [[Ultra Low Floor]] tram]]
{{Main|Transport in Oradea}}
The public transport network is run by OTL (Oradea Transport Local), a municipal agency. It is made up of five tram lines (1R, 1N, 2, 3R, 3N, 4N, 4R and the new 8) and 17 local bus lines (numbered from 10 to 26), and an international suburban one to [[Biharkeresztes]], Hungary. The city has four train stations: {{ill|Oradea railway station|lt=Central|ro|Gara Oradea}}, West, East, and Episcopia Bihor (Bihor Abbey). The West Station is located in the quarter of Ioșia, the Central station (called simply Oradea) is located closer to the city center, near the quarter of Vie, while the East station is located in Velența.

Oradea is served by [[Oradea International Airport]], which has reopened at the end of 2015, after repairs to the runway.

==Education==
{{Peacock|section|date=March 2013}}
Oradea is one of the main education centers of Romania. The city is home to the [[University of Oradea]], one of the largest universities in the country. There are also several private universities, one being Agora University, a modern academic institution founded in 2000. [[Emanuel University]], an accredited private Baptist university, also exists in the city since 2002.<ref name="emanuel.ro">{{cite web|url=http://www.emanuel.ro/|title=Prima Pagina – Universitatea Emanuel din Oradea|website=Universitatea Emanuel din Oradea}}</ref> The [[Partium Christian University]] was established in 1995 and teaches in Hungarian. 

As of 2012, there had been 232 years since the inauguration of higher education in Oradea and 48 years of continuous higher education. A higher institution for philosophic teaching was founded in Oradea in 1780, which became the Faculty of Law in 1788, the oldest [[faculty (division)|faculty]] within a vast region of Eastern Europe.

After 1921, all the courses at the Law Faculty were taught in Romanian. In 1923, the foundation of two theological academies gave new dimensions to the academic life in Oradea. The Law Academy of Oradea, together with the two theological academies, was to make another step forward by integrating a faculty of letters, thus achieving the old desire of creating a University of Crișana in Oradea.

After a thirty-year break in the activity of the Law Academy of Oradea, on 1 October 1963, an order of the Ministry of Education established in Oradea a 3-year Pedagogic Institute meant to do away with the scarcity of teachers in secondary education. The new institution of higher education began its activity with two faculties: Philology and Mathematics-Physics, and a year later other two faculties, History-Geography and Physical Education, were added.

In May 1990, a decree of the Romanian Government established the Technical University of Oradea, later called the [[University of Oradea]]. It was an act of scientific and cultural restoration, a major gain of the people's Revolution of December 1989, and an achievement in [[Crișana]] after the [[Great Union]] on 1 December 1918. A historian of Oradea explains: "As regarding the future, the desire of all well-meant Romanians is to establish in Oradea a complete university, the lights of which will shine across the entire western border of Romania." The University of Oradea is an integrated institution of higher education, comprising 18 faculties.

[[File:Medicina Oradea.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The Faculty of Medicine]]
The structure of the university contains academic education, postgraduate education, and scientific research. 

Research inside the University of Oradea is developing, natural and physical sciences, as well as in the area of social and human sciences, also covering Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Sciences of Life, Agricultural Sciences, Medical Sciences, Technological Sciences, Economical Sciences, Geography, History, Juridical Sciences and Law, Linguistics, Pedagogy, Political Sciences, Psychology, Letters and Arts, Sociology, Philosophy. 

The Sulyok István Reform College was founded in the spring of 1990 by the [[Reformed Diocese of Királyhágómellék|Királyhágómelléki Reform Church]]. In 1999, the school became entirely independent from the [[Protestant Theological Institute of Cluj|Protestant Theology College of Cluj-Napoca]] and changed its name to [[Partium Christian University]]. It presently operates with 12 faculties and a student body of 1400 and is taught in Hungarian.

==Architecture==

[[File:Roman Catholic Basilica.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Roman Catholic Basilica]]
[[File:Sinagoga Ortodoxă, Oradea - (2023) - IMG 03.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Orthodox Synagogue]]
Oradea's current architecture is a mix of Communist-era apartment buildings, mainly in the outer quarters, and historical buildings built when the city was part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In addition to many [[Baroque]] buildings, Oradea has a collection of [[Art Nouveau]] architecture.

Oradea may be considered one of the most representative centres of 1900 architecture in [[Romania]]; it can be compared with those of Secession architecture in Central Europe.

Located at the Romanian western border, Nagyvárad (to be changed to Oradea after the [[Treaty of Trianon]]) had been part of the Hungarian Kingdom, and was, until the Treaty of Trianon in 1921, part of the Central European Austro-Hungarian Empire and, thus, was influenced by the artistic currents of this space.

The buildings of the early 20th century are richly marked by Lechner and [[Vienna]] Secession influence, inheriting an important legacy from the great architects of the artistic movement of the late 19th century and the early 20th century. The architecture and habitat of Oradea are to be approached only in the context of Central European architecture.

By its independence and personality, Oradea has a place among the large great European families of the firmly contoured 1900 Art, especially regarding the area between the Citadel and the Main Railway Station. Here are rental buildings, (Moskovits Palace I and II, Apollo Palace, Stern Palace, Adorján Houses I and II, Darvasy Palace), villas (La Roche, Vágó, Okany Schwartz), hotels (Pannonia, Emke, Rimonoczy, Weiszlovics, Fekete Sas / Vulturul Negru), military buildings – on Armatei Române Street, industrial buildings and warehouses (beer-, spirit-, bricks-factories, electric plant's chimney), public institutions (City Hall, Palace of Orthodox Bishopry, Palace of Greek-Catholic Bishopry, Palace of Justice, banks, houses of commerce and industry etc.), signed by architects who have a prime place in the European 1900 Architecture record: Odon Lechner, Dezső Jakab, Marcell Komor, László and József Vágó, Valér Mende, Ferenc Sztaril, Ferenc Löbl, Kálmán Rimanóczy Sr.and Jr., Anton Szallerbek.  All these sites offer a very diverse research and development material.
These great architects brought in Nagyvárad (Oradea) the influence of Vienna and Budapest through their work, featuring a new style, different from the academic ones, thus creating the premises of a stylistic diversification based on inventions and originality.
[[File:Republicii Street.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|Republicii Street, with the Stern, Apollo and Moskovits-Miksa palaces]]
Like many European cities, "Small Paris", as Oradea was named at the beginning of the last century, has a belle-époque charm given by its Secession, eclectic, New-Romanian, Neoclassic and Baroque architecture. Not impressing by size or opulence, the buildings of Oradea have an aura of welfare, refinement and quality that imprints on the memory.
The early 20th century is well represented in the center, but almost every zone of the city has something especially particular.
The [[historic|history]] center of the city has a great historical, cultural, architectural and urban planning heritage value. It includes settlements nuclei, architectural relics, monuments of architecture and urban planning beginning with the 16th century up to a well represented beginning of the 20th century.
[[File:Baroque Palace.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Baroque Palace]]
A coherent style combines the architectural structure and its artistic means; stucco moldings, statues and medallions, ironwork, stained-glass, opaque and colored glass.
Oradea architecture is a result of the values created by an extremely interesting and valuable ethnic mix, which materialized in a value exchange of a rare richness, and in a shared heritage of great majesty and beauty. In its evident and rare specificity, it appears to be exceptionally valuable.

The authenticity of the place was very well-kept and fed by the previous generations. If the local specificity is not well-preserved, much of the cultural identity, so important in identifying a people, will be lost.
The entire community must feel obliged to a greater attention and sensitivity concerning the heritage protection, and the authorities and experts must develop policies and actions to preserve such a valuable heritage.
