The main street along the river is lined with dozens of pottery shops. Every third Saturday and Sunday in September, there is a very large pottery festival called Setomono Matsuri<ref>[http://www.seto-homestay.jp/e_content_1.html Seto homestay programme]</ref>(瀬戸物祭り) This festival attracts about 20,000 visitors from around Japan and abroad every year.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}
