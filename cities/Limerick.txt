It is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]] and is in the [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West]] which comprises part of the [[Southern Region, Ireland|Southern Region]].

The city straddles the [[River Shannon]], with the historic core of the city located on [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]], which is bounded by the Shannon and [[Abbey River, Limerick|Abbey]] Rivers. Limerick is at the head of the [[Shannon Estuary]], where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. [[Limerick City and County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the city.

==Geography and metropolitan area==
Limerick is located on the River Shannon with four main river-crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the [[Golden Vale]], an area of rich [[pastureland]]. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this agricultural hinterland.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Limerick {{!}} History, Geography & Points of Interest {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Limerick-county-Ireland |access-date=2024-08-16 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

On 1 June 2014, following the amalgamation of the separate local government areas of the county of Limerick and the local government area of the city of Limerick to form Limerick City and County, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area. The Metropolitan District includes the city urban area and extends outwards towards [[Patrickswell]] in the west and [[Castleconnell]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census 2011 – Population Classified by Area (Table 5: Population of towns ordered by county and size, 2006 and 2011)|url=http://cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011vol1andprofile1/Table%205.pdf|website=cso.ie|publisher=Government of the Republic of Ireland|access-date=5 July 2015|year=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112194519/http://cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011vol1andprofile1/Table%205.pdf|archive-date=12 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The City Metropolitan Area however excludes city suburbs located within [[County Clare]].

==History==
{{main|History of Limerick}}
[[File:Limerick-King-Johns-Castle-2012.JPG|thumb|left|[[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] on the [[River Shannon]]]]

===Ancient and medieval history===
{{lang|ga|Luimneach}} originally referred to the general area along the banks of the [[Shannon Estuary]] known as {{lang|ga|Loch Luimnigh}}. The earliest settlement in the city, {{lang|ga|Inis Sibhtonn}}, was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called {{lang|ga|Inis an Ghaill Duibh}}, 'The Dark Foreigner's Island'. The name is recorded in [[Viking]] sources as {{lang|non|Hlymrekr}}.

The city dates from 812; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, [[Ptolemy]], produced in 150 AD the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called {{lang|la|Regia}} at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving [[Cormac mac Airt]] in 221 and a visit by [[Saint Patrick]] in 434 to baptise an [[Dál gCais]] king, Carthann Finn. [[Saint Munchin]], the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the settlement was a place of some note then. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned [[Mungret Abbey]] but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0YY2AAAAMAAJ|title=The History of Limerick|author=John Ferrar|publisher=A.

In early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the [[Kingdom of Thomond]] which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was [[Brian Boru]], ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as [[Thomondgate]], [[Thomond Bridge]] and [[Thomond Park]].

===Late Renaissance/Early modern history===
[[File:DV405 no.235 Limerick.png|thumb|Limerick, painted in 1830]]
[[File:George Street, Limerick (5691906290).jpg|thumb|Cannock's Department Store on O'Connell Street in the early 20th Century]]

Limerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was sometimes called the most beautiful city in Ireland.{{Attribution needed|date=September 2019}} The English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]], a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been taken by its "lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in [[Oxford]]".<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.L. Falkiner 1904</ref>

During the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1651 and twice by [[William III of England|the Williamites]] in the 1690s. The [[Treaty of Limerick]] ended the [[Williamite war in Ireland]] which was fought between supporters of the Catholic [[King James II]] (Jacobites) and the Protestant [[William III of England|King William of Orange]] (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] which rather updated the [[Penal Laws against Irish Catholics|Penal Laws]] against Catholics which had major implications for [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: {{lang|la|urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli}} (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).

The peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the [[Golden Vale]], to Britain and America.<ref name="libraryireland.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/L/Limerick-Port.php|title=Limerick Port|publisher=libraryireland.com|access-date=21 September 2013|archive-date=25 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925151832/http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/L/Limerick-Port.php|url-status=live}}</ref> This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as [[Newtown Pery, Limerick|Georgian Limerick]] began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look, including the extensive terraced streets of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The [[Waterford and Limerick Railway]] linked the city to the [[Dublin–Cork railway line]] in 1848 and to [[Waterford]] in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications. However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleonic eras, and following the [[Act of Union 1800]], and the impact of the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.

===20th-century history===
[[File:Limerick arms.jpg|thumb|City arms on a [[manhole cover]]]]
The [[Limerick boycott]] was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone-throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father [[John Creagh]].

During the [[Irish War of Independence]], the [[Limerick Soviet]] was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the [[British Army]]'s declaration of a "Special Military Area" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control [[food prices]] and publish newspapers.

By the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 [[Shannon Airport]] (located in County Clare, 20&nbsp;km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the [[Shannon Free Zone]] which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third-level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of [[National Institute for Higher Education|NIHE Limerick]] in 1969 which eventually became the [[University of Limerick]] in 1989.

Limerick has a large stock of [[Public housing|local authority]] housing. Before the amalgamation of Limerick City and County Council, 41% of all housing within the old Limerick City Council boundary was [[Public housing|local authority]], which was the highest in Ireland. This figure is however no longer accurate given the larger metropolitan district of the city.<ref name="limerickleader.ie">{{cite news |last=Hurley |first=David |url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/limerick-estates-are-unemployment-blackspots-1-4010085 |title=Limerick estates are unemployment blackspots |publisher=[[Limerick Leader]] |date=2 July 2012 |access-date=27 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704192626/http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/limerick-estates-are-unemployment-blackspots-1-4010085 |archive-date=4 July 2013 }}</ref>

==Government and politics==
[[File:OConnell.JPG|thumb|left|[[O'Connell Street, Limerick]]]]

===Local government===
Limerick city is under the jurisdiction of [[Limerick City and County Council]], which is based at [[City Hall, Limerick]]. The council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected [[councillors]] with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairperson to chair the council. The 21 councillors from the 3 [[local electoral area]]s in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities. As of mid-2021, the mayor was Councillor Daniel Butler.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |title=Fine Gael's Daniel Butler unanimously elected as new Mayor of City and County of Limerick |url=https://www.limerickpost.ie/2021/06/30/fine-gaels-daniel-butler-unanimously-elected-as-new-mayor-of-city-and-county-of-limerick/ |work=limerickpost.ie |date=30 June 2021 |access-date=3 November 2021}}</ref> Former well-known mayors include TDs [[Donogh O'Malley]], [[Stephen Coughlan]], [[Michael Lipper]], [[Jim Kemmy]] and [[Jan O'Sullivan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=List of the Mayors and Sheriffs of Limerick City – 1197–present |url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/asset?id=6610 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313092543/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/asset?id=6610 |archive-date=13 March 2007}}</ref>

Throughout most of the city's history, from 1197 when it gained its first charter, Limerick City had its own local government authority, Limerick Corporation later known as [[Limerick City Council]]. The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by [[Dublin City Council]]. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published ''Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government'' which set out government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with [[Limerick County Council]]. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Local authorities |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html |url-status=dead |work=citizensinformation.ie |access-date=31 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606045428/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html |archive-date=6 June 2014}}</ref>

By the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.limerickcitydb.ie/CDBInfo/Strategy/documents/Strat%20for%20Eco%20Irish.pdf |title=Limerick City Development Board – Strategy for Economic and Social Development |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118205144/http://www.limerickcitydb.ie/CDBInfo/Strategy/documents/Strat%20for%20Eco%20Irish.pdf |archive-date=18 November 2007}}</ref> The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as [[Dooradoyle]], [[Castletroy]] – including the [[University of Limerick|University]], Gouldavoher, and [[Raheen, County Limerick|Raheen]] were continually administered to by Limerick County Council until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and [[Parteen]] to the north of the city are governed by [[Clare County Council]].

Following the merger of the two authorities in 2014, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as [[Patrickswell]] and [[Castleconnell]]. The Metropolitan district returns 21 councillors to Limerick City and County Council which in total has 40 councillors returned from across Limerick City and County.<ref name="irishstatutebook.ie">{{cite web |title=Statutory Instruments S.I.

===National politics===
For elections to the [[Dáil]], Limerick City is in the [[Limerick City (Dáil constituency)|Limerick City]] constituency. From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the [[Constituency Commission]] and the subsequent [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009]]. This changed the electoral boundaries from [[Limerick East]] and [[Limerick West]] to [[Limerick City (Dáil constituency)|Limerick City]] and [[Limerick (Dáil constituency)|Limerick]]. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of [[Castletroy]] and as far east as [[Murroe]]. It also includes part of North [[County Tipperary]]. The [[Limerick (Dáil constituency)|Limerick]] county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For [[European Parliament]] elections, Limerick is in the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency.

In 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural ''National City of Culture'', with a variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at locations around the city throughout the year.

===Art===
The [[Limerick City Gallery of Art]] on [[Pery Square]] is the city's chief venue for [[contemporary art]] exhibitions. It is home to a permanent collection of [[Irish art]], which shows works from the early 18th to 20th century. The gallery houses the National Collection of Contemporary Drawing founded by the artist Samuel Walsh in 1987. Limerick's major contemporary art event is [[EVA International]], Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art.<ref>[http://www.eva.ie/ EVA International (Exhibition of Visual Art)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930225723/http://www.eva.ie/ |date=30 September 2005 }}, Ireland.</ref> EVA International, centered mainly in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, is curated by varying guest curators and includes contemporary artworks by both international and Irish artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eva.ie/about-eva/about/|title=About|publisher=[[EVA International]]|access-date=13 June 2020|archive-date=14 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814220850/https://www.eva.ie/about-eva/about/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Humorous verse ==
A [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]] is a type of humorous [[poetry|verse]] of five lines with an AABBA [[rhyme scheme]]: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or [[County Limerick]],<ref>Loomis 1963, pp. 153–157.</ref> sometimes, particularly to the [[Croom, County Limerick|Maigue Poets]], and may derive from an earlier form of [[nonsense verse]] parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included "Will [or won't] you come (up) to Limerick?"<ref>The phrase "come to Limerick" is known in American slang since the Civil War, as documented in the ''Historical Dictionary of American Slang'' and posts on the American Dialect Society List. One possible derivation of the phrase, proposed by Stephen Goranson on ADS-list, is the Treaty of Limerick, implying "surrender," "settle," "get to the point".</ref> The earliest known use of the name "Limerick" for this type of poem is an 1880 reference, in a [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], newspaper, to a well-known tune.<ref>reported by Stephen Goranson on the ADS-list and in comments at the Oxford Etymologist blog</ref>

Limerick city is approximately 25&nbsp;km from [[Shannon Airport]]. Tourist attractions in the city centre include [[Limerick City Museum]], [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] (1210), [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Limerick|St Mary's Cathedral]] (1168), the [[Hunt Museum]], [[The People's Museum of Limerick]], the [[University of Limerick]], Georgian houses and gardens and the [[Treaty of Limerick|Treaty Stone]].  There are several seasonal tours, including [[Angela's Ashes]] walking tour of Limerick City, a historical walking tour, and boat tours along the [[River Shannon]].

The city centre is divided between the traditional areas of "English Town" on the southern end of King's Island, which includes King John's Castle; "Irish Town", which includes the older streets on the south bank; and the current economic centre further south, called "[[Newtown Pery, Limerick|Newtown Pery]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://limerickslife.com/street-names-n/|title=Limerick city street names beginning with N|work=Limerick's Life|date=20 April 2012|access-date=13 May 2014|archive-date=14 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514073224/http://limerickslife.com/street-names-n/|url-status=live}}</ref> Newtown Pery was built in the late 18th century before the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] and, unusually for an Irish city and unique in Limerick, is laid out on a [[grid plan]]. The [[Limerick Museum]] (formerly aka the Jim Kemmy Municipal Museum), is located in the Old Franciscan Friary in Henry Street.

The Georgian core of the city, with its [[Georgian architecture]] in the Newtown Pery, was developed from the mid-18th century. This core includes O'Connell Street (George Street before independence) from the Cecil Street intersection running to the southwest end of the Crescent, and southeast to Pery Street including Glentworth Street and Barrington Street. Other buildings of architectural note in the city are [[St. John's Cathedral, Limerick|St John's Cathedral]], designed by the notable Victorian architect, [[Philip Charles Hardwick]]. St Mary's Cathedral, at over 800 years old, is one of the oldest in Ireland. St John's Cathedral is more modern.

The [[Hunt Museum]] is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by [[John Hunt (antiquarian)|John and Gertrude Hunt]] during their lifetimes.

The main park in Limerick is the [[People's Park (Limerick)|People's Park]] which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local businessman. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820–1832) and has a large collection of mature [[deciduous]] and evergreen trees.

Limerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/[[Caherdavin]]), Dublin ([[Castletroy]] and the university) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).

In County Limerick, [[Adare]] village and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, approximately 35&nbsp;km (22 miles/30 minutes) from Limerick City along the scenic coastal N69 route from Limerick to Tralee, are also attractions. [[Bunratty Castle]] in County Clare is another local attraction, and is situated 15.4&nbsp;km north of the city.{{fact|date=December 2023}}

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Limerick}}
[[File:RiverPoint.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Riverpoint]], Limerick's tallest building.]]
Limerick is in the region dubbed "[[Mid-West Region, Ireland|the Midwest]]". Also known as the "Shannon Region", this is primarily an economic and social concept. The region encompasses [[County Limerick]], County Clare, North [[County Tipperary]], Northwest [[County Kerry]] and south [[County Offaly]], with its focal point centred on Limerick and its environs within an {{convert|8|km|mi|0|adj=on}} radius.

The city's economic development has been driven in part by the [[University of Limerick]], [[Limerick Institute of Technology]], [[Shannon Airport]] in County Clare and [[Shannon Development]] (an economic development agency), whose precursor was SFADCO (Shannon Free Airport Development Company), an economic agency that provided tax incentives to companies locating in the area surrounding Shannon Airport. Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015. As of 2015, Limerick had the highest disposable income per person in Ireland outside [[Dublin]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Limerick's Recent Economic Growth {{!}} Limerick.ie|url=https://www.limerick.ie/business/growing-limerick/facts-and-figures/limericks-recent-economic-growth|access-date=10 August 2020|website=www.limerick.ie|archive-date=5 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805161602/https://www.limerick.ie/business/growing-limerick/facts-and-figures/limericks-recent-economic-growth|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon. By the middle of the 18th century, Limerick Port grew to become one of Ireland's principal commercial ports, exporting agricultural produce from the most fertile tracts in Ireland known as the [[Golden Vale]] as well as produce from the surrounding counties.<ref name="libraryireland.com"/> The city was one of the main meat processing areas in Ireland, and industries included confectionery and flour production. The city was known for its bacon industry, including the production of [[Limerick ham]] – however this went into decline in the mid-20th century. The fishing industry in Limerick, based on Clancy's Strand opposite [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] and at Coonagh nearby, once employed hundreds of men.<ref>Lysaght, W.

The site employs more than 1,000 people. [[Johnson & Johnson]] subsidiary [[Vistakon]] (the world's largest manufacturer of [[contact lenses]]) has a large facility in [[Castletroy]] in the [[Plassey, County Limerick|National Technology Park]] and also employs close to 1,000 people. It is Vistakon's only production facility outside the United States and one of the largest contact-lens manufacturing plants in the world. Cook Medical, the world's largest privately owned Medical Devices company, employs over 800 people in Limerick at the [[Plassey, County Limerick|National Technology Park]].

The [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn]] had a profound effect on Limerick. The announcement in 2009 that Dell was to move its manufacturing facility from Limerick to Poland devastated the local economy. 1,900 jobs were lost at Dell and it is believed that for every job that was lost at Dell at least another 4 to 5 were at risk. The closure of the Dell manufacturing facility amounted to 2% of Ireland's national GDP.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0108/dell.html | publisher=RTÉ News | title=1,900 jobs lost at Dell in Limerick | date=8 January 2009 | access-date=28 July 2012 | archive-date=16 January 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116235908/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0108/Dell.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The downturn in the construction industry also cost many jobs as did the stalled Limerick regeneration programme which promised investment in Limerick's deprived city areas. As of 2012 unemployment had become a major problem across the city with the unemployment rate in the city at 28.6% which was almost twice the national average.<ref name="limerickleader.ie"/>

===Retail===
The [[Crescent Shopping Centre]] is the largest shopping centre in Ireland, outside of Dublin, and the largest in the province of Munster. It is located in [[Dooradoyle]] about 3&nbsp;km south of the city centre, and has over 90 shopping outlets along with restaurants and a 12-screen Omniplex Cinema. The city centre also has a large retail district which includes a mix of more traditional type of shops as well as some modern [[high street]] stores. [[Cruises Street, Limerick|Cruises Street]] is one of the main shopping streets. [[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]], [[William Street, Limerick|William Street]], [[Bedford Row (Limerick)|Bedford Row]] and [[Thomas Street, Limerick|Thomas Street]]) are also retail streets within the city.

===Waterway transport===
Historically, waterway transport has been key to Limerick's development. Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by the ease of access facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey – Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]]. Today the [[Shannon Foynes Port]] is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general-purpose facility port is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company which operates all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ireland's principal deep-water bulk products port {{!}} Shannon Foynes Port Company|url=https://www.sfpc.ie/about-us/|access-date=10 August 2020|language=en-US|archive-date=1 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601173627/https://www.sfpc.ie/about-us/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Similar to the rest of Ireland, basketball was a popular sport in Limerick during the 1970s and 1980s, with up to four divisions in the men's and women's local leagues.

The main clubs in the city were St. Colm's and Marathon with St. Colm's, in particular, having a long history in the National Leagues.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Limerick is currently represented in the [[Premier League (Ireland)|National Leagues]] by the men's [[UL Eagles]] team and the women's UL Aughinish team.

Ireland's national sports of [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]] are widely played in the city and its surrounding suburbs. The [[Limerick county hurling team]] are the [[2022 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|current All-Ireland champions]], has won the last four senior hurling championships in a row, and are [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship records and statistics#General performances|of the top four teams in the country historically]].

Limerick won the first [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] in 1887 when represented by the city's Commercials club and repeated the feat in 1896. Since then, the game has lived mostly in the shadow of hurling but a resurgence in 2000 saw the county win its first Munster Under-21 title and has since reached three Munster Senior finals. Monaleen (Móin a'Lín) is the only city club to play football in the senior grade. Saint Patrick's (Naomh Pádraig), Claughaun (An Clochán), Mungret St. Paul's (Mungairit Naomh Pól) and [[Na Piarsaigh GAA (Limerick)|Na Piarsaigh]] are at intermediate level and Milford (Áth a Mhuilinn), Abbey Sarsfields (Sáirséalaigh na Mainstreach) and Ballinacurra Gaels (Gaeil Bhaile na Cora) play at junior level.
