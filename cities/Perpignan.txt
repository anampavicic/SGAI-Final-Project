'''Perpignan''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|ɜːr|p|ɪ|n|j|ɒ̃}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|p|ɛər|p|iː|ˈ|n|j|ɑː|n}},<ref>{{cite LPD|3}}</ref><ref>{{cite EPD|18}}</ref> {{IPA|fr|pɛʁpiɲɑ̃|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-Fabricio Cardenas (Culex)-Perpignan.wav}}; {{langx|ca|Perpinyà}} {{IPA|ca|pəɾpiˈɲa|}}; {{langx|oc|Perpinhan}} {{IPA|oc|peɾpiˈɲa|}}) is the [[prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] [[departments of France|department]] in [[Southern France]], in the heart of the plain of [[Roussillon]], at the foot of the [[Pyrenees]] a few kilometres from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[scrublands]] of the [[Corbières Massif|Corbières massif]]. It is the centre of the [[Perpignan Méditerranée Métropole]] metropolitan area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/geographie/commune/66136-perpignan|title=Commune de Perpignan (66136)|publisher=INSEE|access-date=26 September 2024}}</ref>

In 2021, Perpignan had a population of 119,656 in the commune proper, and the [[urban unit|agglomeration]] had a total population of 205,183, making it the last major French city before the [[Spain|Spanish]] border. Perpignan is sometimes seen as the "entrance" to the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

Perpignan was the capital of the [[provinces of France|former province]] and [[County of Roussillon]] (''Rosselló'' in Catalan) and continental capital of the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. It has preserved an extensive old centre with its ''bodegas'' in the historic centre, coloured houses in a series of picturesque streets and alleys stretching between the banks of the [[Têt (river)|Têt]] and its tributary, the Basse.

The city is also known for its International Festival of Photojournalism, the medieval Trobades festival and its centuries-old [[garnet]] industry.

==Geography==
===Location===
Perpignan is located in the center of the Roussillon plain, 13&nbsp;km west of the Mediterranean coast. It is the southernmost city of [[metropolitan France]].

===Hydrography===
Perpignan is crossed by the largest river in Roussillon, the [[Têt (river)|Têt]], and by one of its tributaries, the Basse. Floods have occurred, as in 1892 when the rising of the Têt in Perpignan destroyed 39 houses, leaving more than 60 families homeless.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fabricio Cardenas |url=http://vieuxpapierspo.blogspot.fr/2014/03/inondations-en-novembre-1892.html |title=Vieux papiers des Pyrénées-Orientales: Inondations en novembre 1892 |website=Vieuxpapierspo.blogspot.fr |date=2 March 2014 |access-date=2016-12-17}}</ref>

===Climate===
Perpignan has a typical hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''), similar to much of the Mediterranean coastline of France. One might expect rain to be rare in the city, but the annual precipitation levels are similar to the national average. However, the city is known for its patchy rains, with weeks or even months of rain falling in a matter of hours, followed by several weeks without a drop of water. Perpignan experiences very hot summers and fairly mild winters. Temperatures can reach 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F), while there has been little snow for decades. Most precipitation occurs in the cold season, with summers being extremely dry. A fresh north-westerly wind often blows, the Tramontana (French: Tramontane, pronounced [tʁamɔ̃tan]), keeping the sky clear much of the time and resulting in high annual sunshine. But the presence of this wind makes winters colder than would be expected from the geographical position of the city.

==Toponymy==
The name of Perpignan appears in 927 as ''Perpinianum'', followed in 959 by ''Villa Perpiniano'', ''Pirpinianum'' in the 11th century, and ''Perpiniani'' in 1176. ''Perpenyà'', which appears in the 13th century, was the most common form until the 15th century, and was still used in the 17th century. It probably derives from the Roman name ''Perpennius''.

[[File:Perpignan - Ecole militaire (vers 1780).jpg|thumb|Perpignan {{Circa|1780}}]]
Though settlement in the area goes back to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, the medieval town of Perpignan seems to have been founded around the beginning of the 10th century. Shortly afterwards, Perpignan became the capital of the counts of [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]]. Historically, it was part of the region known as [[Septimania]]. In 1172 Count [[Girard II of Roussillon|Girard II]] bequeathed his lands to the [[List of Counts of Barcelona|Counts of Barcelona]]. Perpignan acquired the institutions of a partly self-governing [[medieval commune|commune]] in 1197. French [[feudalism|feudal rights]] over Roussillon were given up by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]].

When [[James I of Aragon|James I the Conqueror]], king of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and count of [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]], founded the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] in 1276, Perpignan became the capital of the mainland territories of the new state. The subsequent decades are considered the city's historical golden age. It prospered as a centre of cloth manufacture, leatherwork, goldsmithery, and other luxury crafts. King [[Philip III of France|Philippe III]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]] died there in 1285, as he was returning from his unsuccessful [[crusade]] against the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese Crown]].
[[File:Perpignan - Avenue de la Gare (vers 1905).jpg|thumb|Perpignan c. 1905]]
In 1344 [[Peter IV of Aragon]] annexed the Kingdom of Majorca and Perpignan once more became part of the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. A few years later it lost approximately half of its population to the [[Black Death]]. It was attacked and occupied by [[Louis XI of France]] in 1463; a violent uprising against French rule in 1473 was harshly put down after a long siege, but in 1493 [[Charles VIII of France]], wishing to conciliate [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in order to free himself to invade [[Italy]], restored it to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].{{sfn|Pigaillem|2008|p=109}}

Again [[Siege of Perpignan (1642)|besieged and captured]] by the French during the [[Thirty Years' War]] in September 1642, Perpignan was formally ceded by Spain 17 years later in the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], and thereafter remained a French possession.

In June 2020, [[Louis Aliot]] of the [[National Rally]] was elected mayor of Perpignan. This was the first time since 1995 that the far-right party had won a city of more than 100,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-perpignan/far-right-to-win-southern-french-town-of-perpignan-exit-poll-idUSKBN23Z0PM|title=Far-right to win southern French town of Perpignan: Exit poll|newspaper=Reuters|date=28 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20200628-france-s-greens-makes-gains-macron-loses-ground-in-low-turnout-local-elections|title = France's Greens make gains, Macron loses ground in low-turnout local elections|website=France24.com|date = 28 June 2020}}</ref>

Like the rest of the south of France, Perpignan is a rugby stronghold. Their [[rugby union]] side, [[USA Perpignan]], are regular competitors in the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] and have been champions of the French [[Top 14]] seven times (most recently in [[2008–09 Top 14 season|2009]]). They play at the [[Stade Aimé Giral]].

Their [[rugby league]] team [[Catalans Dragons]] plays in the British [[Super League]]. The Dragons' games in Perpignan against the Northern English-based sides are usually very popular with British rugby fans, with thousands descending on the city on the day of the game, including many holidaying fans travelling up from the Spanish [[Costa Brava]] to join those who came directly from the UK. The club was founded in 2000 as a merger of [[XIII Catalan]] with the nearby team [[AS Saint Estève]] to form Union Treiziste Catalane in 2000 who changed their name to Catalans Dragons upon transfer from the [[French rugby league system|French]] to [[British rugby league system]]. The Dragons became the first non-English team to win the [[Challenge Cup]] when they defeated [[Warrington Wolves]] in the [[2018 Challenge Cup final|2018 final]]. They are based at [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]]. AS Saint Estève's youth teams still operates as [[Saint-Estève XIII Mavericks]] in the [[National Division 2]], while a new [[Elite One Championship]] club was formed in 2000 under the name [[Saint-Estève XIII Catalan]] which is in effect Catalans Dragons reserves; both play at the [[Stade Municipal (Saint-Estève)|Stade Municipal]] in the suburb of [[Saint-Estève]].

The local [[association football]] team is [[Canet Roussillon FC]].

Traditional commerce was in wine, [[olive oil]], corks (the [[cork oak]] ''Quercus suber'' grows in Perpignan's mild climate), wool, leather, and iron. In May 1907 it was a seat of agitation by southern producers for government enforcement of wine quality following a collapse in prices. [[JOB rolling papers]] are currently manufactured in Perpignan.
