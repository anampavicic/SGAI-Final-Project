'''Timiș''' ({{IPA|ro|ˈtimiʃ}}) is a county (''[[județ]]'') of western [[Romania]] on the border with [[Hungary]] and [[Serbia]], in the [[historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Banat]], with the county seat at [[Timișoara]]. It is the westernmost and the largest county in Romania in terms of land area. The county is also part of the [[Danube–Criș–Mureș–Tisa Euroregion]].

== Name ==
The name of the county comes from the [[Timiș (river)|Timiș River]], known in Roman antiquity as ''Tibisis'' or ''Tibiscus''. According to Lajos Kiss' [[etymological dictionary]], the name of the river probably comes from the [[Dacian language]]: ''thibh-isjo'' ("marshy").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q1dAAAAIAAJ |title=Földrajzi nevek etimológiai szótára |last=Kiss |first=Lajos |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |location=Budapest |date=1978 |isbn=9630514907 |oclc=4778015 |access-date=29 July 2022 |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207232023/https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q1dAAAAIAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Timiș County is known as ''Temes megye'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Kreis Temesch'', in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] as Тамишки округ/''Tamiški okrug'', in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as Тімішський повіт, and in [[Banat Bulgarian dialect|Banat Bulgarian]] as ''okrug Timiš''.

{{Romanian counties map}}

Timiș is the largest county in Romania, occupying 8,696.7 km<sup>2</sup>, i.e. 3.65% of the country's area.<ref name="bnr">{{cite web |url=https://www.bnr.ro/DocumentInformation.aspx?idInfoClass=13567&idDocument=13334&directLink=1 |title=Monografia județului Timiș |work=Banca Națională a României |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207231521/https://www.bnr.ro/files/d/Pubs_ro/Monografii/Monografie_Timis_2012.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|3}} It is crossed by the [[46th parallel north]], the [[21st meridian east]] and the [[22nd meridian east]]. On its territory is the westernmost point of Romania, i.e. [[Beba Veche]], at 20°15'44", in the ''[[List of extreme points of Romania|Triplex Confinium]]'' point.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox8ZAQAAMAAJ |title=Enciclopedia geografică a României |last=Ghinea |first=Dan |edition=2nd |publisher=Editura Enciclopedică |location=Bucharest |date=2000 |page=127}}</ref>

Timiș County is part of the [[Vest (development region)|West Development Region]] along with the counties of [[Arad County|Arad]], [[Caraș-Severin County|Caraș-Severin]] and [[Hunedoara County|Hunedoara]], being located in the center of the historical province of [[Banat]]. Due to its geographical position, almost a third of the county's borders are at the same time state borders. Thus, in the northwestern part, it borders [[Csongrád-Csanád County]] ([[Hungary]]), 18 km of this border being on the [[Mureș River]]. To the southwest, between [[Beba Veche]] and [[Jamu Mare|Lățunaș]], Timiș County borders the [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] ([[Serbia]]). The land connection with the counties of the neighboring countries is ensured by the border crossing points from [[Cenad]], [[Moravița]] and [[Jimbolia]]. The neighboring Romanian counties with Timiș County are [[Arad County|Arad]] to the north, [[Hunedoara County|Hunedoara]] to the east and [[Caraș-Severin County|Caraș-Severin]] to the southeast.<ref name="strategie-1">{{cite book |url=https://www.cjtimis.ro/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Analiza-teritoriala-si-administrativa-a-judetului-Timis-compressed-1.pdf |title=Strategia de dezvoltare economică și socială a județului Timiș 2021–2027 |volume=1.

=== Relief ===
[[File:TM infobox térkép.gif|thumb|Physical map of Timiș County]]
The relief is characterized by the predominance of [[plain]]s, which cover the western part (low plain) and the central part (high plain) of the county. Timiș County features all [[landform]]s, with altitudes between 75 m in Banat Plain and 1,374 m in [[Poiana Ruscă Mountains]]. Proportionally, the plain covers about 6,700 km<sup>2</sup>, representing 77.2% of the county's area; the hills cover about 1,650 km<sup>2</sup>, i.e. 19.01%; and the mountains cover a relatively small area of 300 km<sup>2</sup>, i.e. 3.45%.<ref name="bnr" />{{rp|3}}

The plain penetrates in a gulf-like manner the hilly areas, on the valleys of [[Timiș (river)|Timiș]] (towards [[Lugoj]]) and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]] (towards [[Făget]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=Unitățile de relief ale României |volume=5.

The hills of Lăpugiu, Făget, Lugoj, Lipova, Silagiu and Sacoș are rich in pastures, orchards of fruit trees, vineyards, but also in cereal crops. The relief in the eastern part of the county is dominated by the Poiana Ruscă Mountains, with deep valleys and steep slopes, with heights that rarely exceed 1300 m (Padeș peak – 1374 m, Rusca peak – 1355 m).<ref name="barbu">{{cite book |url=https://dokumen.tips/documents/mic-atlas-al-judetului-timis.html |title=Mic atlas al județului Timiș (caleidoscop) |last=Barbu |first=Dinu |location=Timișoara |publisher=Artpress |date=2013 |edition=5th |isbn=978-973-108-553-1 |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904084534/https://dokumen.tips/documents/mic-atlas-al-judetului-timis.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|8–9}}

=== Natural resources ===
Located in the southeastern part of the [[Pannonian Plain]], the subsoil of Timiș County there are deposits of [[lignite]] ([[Boldur|Sinersig]]), [[basalt]] ([[Brestovăț|Lucareț]]–[[Ghizela|Șanovița]]), [[manganese]] ([[Pietroasa, Timiș|Pietroasa]]), [[clay]] ([[Biled]], [[Cărpiniș]], [[Jimbolia]], [[Lugoj]] and [[Sânnicolau Mare]]), [[crude oil]] and [[gas]] (in the western part of the county), [[sand]] ([[Șag]]) and glass sand ([[Margina|Groși]]–[[Făget]], [[Tomești, Timiș|Tomești]] and [[Fârdea|Gladna Montană]]).<ref name="bnr" />{{rp|4}} Mineral waters are also exploited in [[Buziaș]], [[Orțișoara|Călacea]], [[Giulvăz|Ivanda]], [[Bogda]] and [[Timișoara]]. The soil of Timiș County offers extremely favorable conditions for the cultivation of agricultural plants, especially for the cultivation of cereals, but also for technical and fodder plants, as well as for fruit growing and [[viticulture]]. The forests are relatively few. In the eastern part there are forests of [[fir]], [[spruce]] and [[beech]]. In the other parts of the county there are small forests of [[oak]], [[Quercus cerris|Austrian oak]], [[Quercus frainetto|Hungarian oak]], and in the meadows – [[Populus|poplars]] and [[willow]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prefecturatimis.ro/judet.php?nivel=4 |title=Resurse de importanță economică |work=Instituția Prefectului – Județul Timiș |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=9 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220609120529/http://www.prefecturatimis.ro/judet.php?nivel=4 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Bega river in the summertime.jpg|thumb|[[Bega (Tisza)|Bega River]] in [[Timișoara]]]]
The hydrographic network of Timiș County, spread over 3,104 km, is composed of two hydrographic basins: Bega–Timiș–Caraș and Mureș. The most important rivers in size and hydropower potential in the county, which cross the territory through the center, dividing it into two halves, south and north, are [[Timiș (river)|Timiș]] and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]]. Timiș is the largest inland river in Banat, which has its sources on the eastern slopes of the [[Semenic|Semenic Mountains]], in [[Caraș-Severin County]]. The river is formed at the confluence of three branches: Semenic, Grădiște and Brebu. It crosses the whole of Timiș County, then passes into Serbia where it flows into the [[Danube]], to [[Pančevo]]. Bega River springs from the Poiana Ruscă Mountains and flows into the [[Tisza]] after a route of 244 km, being its southernmost tributary. Downstream, towards the western edge, up to the border, the course of the Bega River is completely canalized. The [[Bega Canal]] is navigable both in Romania and in Serbia, having a length of 44 km only in Romania.
[[File:RO TM Surduc 4.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Surduc]]]]
The natural lakes, with small areas and depths, are represented by the lake complex of [[Satchinez]] (40 ha; 1.5 m deep), the two lakes of [[Becicherecu Mic]] (one of 33 ha and another of 13 ha), the Petra pond of [[Jebel, Timiș|Jebel]], etc. Between 1969 and 1975, pond-like lakes for [[flood control]], [[irrigation]] and [[fishing]] were arranged on the courses of both Timiș and Bega. The largest of these, [[Lake Surduc]], was arranged on [[Gladna|Gladna stream]], a tributary of the Bega, and has an area of 460 ha and a volume of 51 million m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pressalert.ro/2016/02/lacul-surduc-sursa-de-apa-si-loc-de-agrement-pentru-vestul-tarii-ce-legende-si-ce-promisiuni-au-ramas-neindeplinite-foto/ |title=Lacul Surduc, sursă de apă și loc de agrement pentru vestul țării.

The high density of the hydrographic network, the low slopes of the riverbeds in the plain sector, the reduced depth of the groundwater, the presence of [[ultisol]]s, all favor the floods and marshes. To reduce the amplitude of these phenomena, since the first half of the 18teenth century, large engineering works (damming, canalization, draining etc.) were made in the region, most of which are still functional today. Among the major [[flash flood]]s and [[flood]]s in the Banat Plain, the most important were those of May 1912, June 1966 and [[2005 European floods|April 2005]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoL2DAAAQBAJ |title=Landform Dynamics and Evolution in Romania |editor-last1=Rădoane |editor-first1=Maria |editor-last2=Vespremeanu-Stroe |editor-first2=Alfred |publisher=Springer |date=2017 |pages=834–835 |issn=2194-3168 |isbn=978-3-319-32589-7 |access-date=29 July 2022 |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207231405/https://books.google.com/books?id=EoL2DAAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Flora ===
The natural vegetation, strongly influenced by human activities, is characterized by the small-scale presence of [[forest-steppe]] plants and by a higher frequency of hydro- and hygrophilous vegetation in low plains and meadows with excess moisture. The extensive agricultural crops in the plain alternate with small areas of secondary meadows dominated by fescue associations (''[[Festuca valesiaca]]'', ''[[Festuca rupicola]]'' and ''[[Festuca|Festuca pseudovina]]'') mixed with wormwood (''[[Artemisia austriaca]]'') and others. The deciduous forests, made up of pedunculate oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), Austrian oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]'') and Hungarian oak (''[[Quercus frainetto]]''), occupy insularly or on compact areas the Lipova Plateau, the Lugoj and Pogăniș Hills and partly the Gătaia Plain. In the eastern extremity of Timiș County there are sessile oak forests (''[[Quercus petraea]]'') mixed with Austrian oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]''), beech forests (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'') mixed with hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]''), and the upper slopes of the Poiana Ruscă Mountains are covered with [[spruce]] forests mixed with [[fir]] and [[beech]].

In Timiș County there are 45 [[nature reserve]]s that total 134,766.49 ha or about 13% of the county's area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.banatulazi.ro/13-din-suprafata-judetului-timis-se-afla-in-arii-naturale-protejate/ |title=13% din suprafața județului Timiș se află în arii naturale protejate |work=Banatul Azi |last=Dogaru |first=Viorel |date=29 May 2016 |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=22 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220522203014/https://www.banatulazi.ro/13-din-suprafata-judetului-timis-se-afla-in-arii-naturale-protejate/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Fauna ===
The fauna, adapted to the relief and vegetation conditions, includes steppe species ([[European hare|hares]], [[Spermophilus|ground squirrels]], [[European polecat|polecats]], [[Apodemus|field mice]], [[European mole|moles]], [[European roller|rollers]], [[common quail|quails]], [[grey partridge|partridges]], [[lark]]s, [[common starling|starlings]], [[lizard]]s, various insects), forest species ([[roe deer|deer]], [[squirrel]]s, [[bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[wild boar]]s, [[wildcat]]s, [[dormouse|dormice]], [[Eurasian jay|jays]], [[salamander]]s, etc.) and water species ([[heron]]s, [[mallard]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[stork]]s, [[frog]]s and a wide variety of fish, such as [[northern pike|pike]], [[common barbel|barbel]], [[Prussian carp]], [[wels catfish|wels]], [[perch]], [[Eurasian carp|carp]], etc.).

=== Climate ===
The climate has a moderate temperate [[continental climate|continental]] character, with hot summers and mild winters due to both the influences of the oceanic (from the west) and Mediterranean (from the south and southwest) air masses and the fact that over 85% of the territory belongs to the plain climate (the remaining 15% belongs to the climate of hilly and mountainous regions).<ref name="cadru-natural" />{{rp|49}} The western area of the Banat Plain is classified according to [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's guide]] as [[Humid subtropical climate|Cfa]], and the mountainous area in the east of the county as [[Humid continental climate|Dfb]].<ref name="cadru-natural">{{cite book |url=https://www.cjtimis.ro/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PATJ-Timis-Volumul-II-Cadrul-natural-mediu-zone-de-risc.pdf |title=Plan de amenajare a teritoriului județului Timiș |volume=2.

The annual averages are close to 11 °C in the region with plain climate and decrease by 1–2 °C on the hills in the east of the county.<ref name="barbu" />{{rp|9}} The averages of the warmest month (July) exceed 21 °C in the plain and fall below 18 °C in the east. The averages of the coldest month (January) are higher than –2 °C in the plain and rise to values higher than –1 °C in the east of the county. The absolute maximum temperature (42 °C) was recorded in [[Banloc]] (24 July 2007), and the absolute minimum temperature (–35.3 °C) in Timișoara (29 January 1963).<ref name="cadru-natural" />{{rp|55}}

The average multiannual precipitation amounts to increasing quantities from west to east, i.e. 569 mm in Jimbolia, 620.6 mm in Timișoara, 734 mm in Făget and over 1,200 mm on the ridges of the Poiana Ruscă Mountains. The maximum rainfall occurs in June, as a result of the intensification of cyclonic activity in the [[North Atlantic]] or in the Mediterranean basin. On the other hand, the lowest average monthly amounts fall in February–March. The snow layer is unstable and has insignificant thicknesses.

Predominant winds blow from the north (16.9%), east (15%), northwest (9.1%) and south (8.4%), with average annual speeds between 1.2 and 3.8 m/s. Local winds include ''austru'' (dry wind from the south), ''coșavă'' (high-speed cold wind), ''rușavăț'' (in the Banat Plain) and mountain breezes (in the east).<ref name="cadru-natural" />{{rp|65}}

According to the 2011 census, [[Hungarians]] are the largest ethnic minority in Timiș County, numbering 35,295 people or 5.2% of the county's population. Significant concentrations of the Hungarian population follow the areas where the policy of colonization of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] manifested itself in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. At the 2011 census, there were 16 localities – all rural – that had at least 20% Hungarian population. However, their total population represents only 12.6% of the Hungarian population in the county. This is explained by the migration of Hungarians from rural to urban areas after 1990. By weight, the largest Hungarian communities are found in [[Otelec]] (''Ótelek''; 75.1%), [[Beba Veche|Cherestur]] (''Pusztakeresztúr''; 69.7%), [[Balinț|Bodo]] (''Nagybodófalva''; 64%), [[Tormac]] (''Végvár''; 60.6%) and [[Sacoșu Turcesc|Otvești]] (''Ötvösd''; 52.6%).<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346084403 |title=Comunitățile etnice minoritare maghiare din județul Timiș – perspectivă istorico-geografică |last=Berceanu |first=Iancu C. |journal=Morisena |volume=3 |issue=19 |date=2020 |pages=40–48 |issn=2501-1359}}</ref>

The flag of Timiș County has a rectangular shape, with its width equal to ⅔ of its length and consists of the county coat of arms superimposed on a white background. White chosen for the flag signifies purity and peace. Above the coat of arms is inscribed in capital letters in [[vermilion]] the word "Romania", and below it is inscribed with the same characters in [[cobalt blue]] the words "Timiș County". The county flag was approved in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/247846 |title=Hotărâre nr. 1129 din 14 octombrie 2021 |work=Portal Legislativ |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=13 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220613164228/https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/247846 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The coat of arms was approved in 2002 and consists of a cut [[escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]]; at the top, on the red [[field (heraldry)|field]], a golden lion coming out of the battlements of a wall of built gold; the lion holds a bent sword, with a wide point, made of silver; in the upper right-hand corner is a golden sun, and in the upper left, a rising silver moon. At the bottom, on the blue field, is a wavy silver band. The lion with armed arm, characteristic of [[Banat of Temeswar]], symbolizes the defenders of the land and of Christianity against the Ottoman armies; the lion carries the victorious sword of [[Pál Kinizsi]], Count of [[Temes County]]. The gold wall symbolizes the [[Timișoara Fortress|fortress of Timișoara]]. The golden sun symbolizes, through its position, the lofty goals for which the heroes of this land fought. The silver moon represents the pair of the sun. The wavy silver band on the blue field symbolizes the [[Timiș (river)|Timiș River]], which gives the county its name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/FormaPrintabila/00000G0E1XE8G0XPEG631J9VZE1H3TFG |title=Hotărâre nr. 541 din 30 mai 2002 |work=Portal Legislativ |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207231543/https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/FormaPrintabila/00000G0E1XE8G0XPEG631J9VZE1H3TFG |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Economy ==
Timiș County has one of the most dynamic economies in Romania. The county's economy gradually transformed from a predominantly industrial one, sometimes with significant losses due to the non-use of labor and capital endowments, into a [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary one]] (based mainly on [[Service (economics)|services]]).<ref name="economie" />{{rp|141}} The specialization of Timiș County stands out in the computer, automotive and electrical equipment industry, these registering high values of the [[location quotient]] (as of 2019).<ref name="ghid">{{cite web |url=https://www.cjtimis.ro/wp-content/uploads/flipbook/17/book.html |title=Ghidul investitorului |work=Consiliul Județean Timiș |access-date=20 April 2023 |archive-date=9 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221209192524/https://www.cjtimis.ro/wp-content/uploads/flipbook/17/book.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|18}}

Timiș County is also the largest importer of consumer goods, after Bucharest.<ref name="prezentare" />
=== Industry ===
The industry of Timiș County is strong and diversified, due to the high rate of [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] and brownfield investments, the western location of the county, the high qualification of the labor force, as well as the entrepreneurial tradition. The most significant share in the total production of the county is held by the [[manufacturing industry]], having as sub-branches: [[electronics industry]], [[food industry]], [[chemical industry]], [[textile industry]], [[metalworking|metal]] and [[wood industry|wood processing industry]] and [[construction]]. Although with only 8% of the number of companies in Timiș, the manufacturing industry registers a turnover of 40% of the county's total.<ref name="prezentare">{{cite web |url=https://www.cjtimis.ro/judetul-timis/prezentarea-judetului/ |title=Prezentarea județului |work=Consiliul Județean Timiș |date=2 March 2021 |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=24 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220624093339/https://www.cjtimis.ro/judetul-timis/prezentarea-judetului/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
Timiș County ranks first in the country in terms of both agricultural and arable land.

One of the oldest and most important agricultural activities in the county, with favorable climatic conditions, is the cultivation of [[cereals]] and technical plants, and [[viticulture]] is practiced in most of the communes in the plain and hill area of the county. Places like [[Recaș]], [[Buziaș]] and [[Giarmata]] are renowned for their [[wine production]]. The production of vegetables in individual micro-farms is also a traditional economic activity, especially in the rural localities in the vicinity of urban centers. By cultivated area, the main crops are [[maize]] (165,643 ha), [[wheat]] and [[rye]] (133,657 ha), [[sunflower]] (78,242 ha), perennial [[fodder]] (38,060 ha) and [[soybeans]] (21,200 ha).<ref name="insse" />{{rp|77}} Livestock farming is also an important, traditional branch of Timiș agriculture, and in recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of animals in the private sector.

=== Tourism ===
The geographical position of the county in the immediate vicinity of the border with Hungary and Serbia leads to a high transit tourism, but with short and medium length of stay.

== Culture ==
=== Music ===
Timiș County has a rich musical history. Notable in this respect are the choirs of Banat ''Bauer''. Banat choirs have their origins in [[church music]], learned in schools, where the teacher was both organist, choir conductor, and not infrequently, composer. The choirs, which were to become a real movement in Banat, were an important means of national manifestation of the people of Banat, through which the Romanian language and culture were promoted. The oldest Romanian choir in Banat was the plowmen's vocal choir, founded in 1857 in [[Belinț|Chizătău]], which was born from the old church choir. It was also the most famous and appreciated choral formation in the area, which had resounding success at various competitions and festivals, along with other Banat choirs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Corul din Chizătău |last=Stan |first=Constantin-Tufan |location=Timișoara |publisher=Marineasa |date=2004 |isbn=973-631-126-0}}</ref> Banat choirs had a rich repertoire, consisting of national, folk songs or choral works composed by [[Ion Vidu]], [[Filaret Barbu]] or Iosif Velceanu.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pressalert.ro/2019/02/istorie-muzicala-povestile-corurilor-din-zona-banatului-subiectul-unei-noi-editii-evenimentului-serile-patrimoniului/ |title=Istorie muzicală.
