Located in the [[Sacramento Valley]] region of [[Northern California]], the city had a population of 101,475 in the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], an increase from 86,187 in the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Chico is the cultural and economic center of the northern Sacramento Valley, as well as the most populous city in [[California]] north of the capital city of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. The city is known as a [[college town]], as the home of [[California State University, Chico]], and for [[Bidwell Park]], one of the [[List of urban parks by size|largest urban parks in the world]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Chico, California}}
[[File:Diseño_del_Rancho_del_Arroyo_Chico.png|thumb|left|Chico's origins lie in [[Rancho del Arroyo Chico]], a Mexican-era [[ranchos of California|rancho]] granted by Governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1844.]]

[[File:Kendall Hall as seen from Laxson Auditorium-01006.jpg|thumb|left|[[California State University, Chico]] was founded in 1887.]]
The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Chico—a Spanish word meaning "little"<s><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gannett |first1=Henry |title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States |date=1905 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |page=80 |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/0258/report.pdf |access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref></s>—were the [[Mechoopda]] [[Maidu]] Native Americans. Within the boundaries of modern day Chico, there existed a Maidu village, whose name was recorded as '''Bah-hahp'-ke''', meaning "straight tree".<ref>Heizer, Robert F.  Hester, Thomas R. (1970) ''Papers on California Ethnography - Chapter 9: Names and Locations of Some Ethnographic Patwin and Maidu Villages''. pages 79-118. [https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/anthpubs/ucb/proof/pdfs/arf009-006.pdf]</ref>

The City of Chico was founded in 1860 by [[John Bidwell]], a member of one of the first wagon trains to reach California in 1843. During the [[American Civil War]], [[Camp Bidwell]] (named for John Bidwell, by then a [[brigadier general]] of the [[California Army National Guard#History|California Militia]]), was established a mile outside Chico, by Lt. Col. A. E. Hooker with a company of cavalry and two of infantry, on August 26, 1863.

By early 1865, it was being referred to as Camp Chico when a post called Camp Bidwell was established in northeast California, later to be [[Fort Bidwell]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jb89AAAAYAAJ&q=%22Camp+Bidwell%22 |title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies|year=1897|volume=L, Part II-Correspondence, etc.|series=1|pages=593–594, 1125|access-date=November 4, 2011|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]|location=Washington DC}}</ref> The city became incorporated January 8, 1872.

Chico was home to a significant [[Chinese Americans|Chinese American]] community when it was first incorporated, but arsonists burned Chico's Chinatown in February 1886, driving Chinese Americans out of town.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--not stated-->|date=March 29, 1877|title=THE CHICO MASSACRE|volume=3|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SDU18770329.2.12&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|work=[[Sacramento Daily Union]]|type=newspaper|location=Sacramento|via=the [[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]|access-date=June 20, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Michele|first=Shover|date=December 1988|title=Chico Women: Nemesis of a Rural Town's Anti-Chinese Campaigns, 1876-1888|url=https://online.ucpress.edu/ch/article-abstract/67/4/228/32583/Chico-Women-Nemesis-of-a-Rural-Town-s-Anti-Chinese|format=PDF|journal=[[California History]]|series=|location=[[San Francisco]]|publisher=[[California Historical Society]]|volume=67|issue=4|pages=228–243|doi=10.2307/25158493 |jstor=25158493 |issn=0162-2897|eissn=2327-1485|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Historian W.H. "Old Hutch" Hutchinson identified five events as the most seminal in Chico history. They included the arrival of John Bidwell in 1850, the arrival of the [[California and Oregon Railroad]] in 1870, the establishment in 1887 of the Northern Branch of the State Normal School, which later became [[California State University, Chico]] (Chico State), the purchase of the Sierra Lumber Company by the [[Diamond Match Company]] in 1900, and the development of the Army Air Base, which is now the [[Chico Municipal Airport]].<ref name="ca20thcph">Chico: A 20th century Pictorial History (1995)</ref>

Other events include the construction and relocation of [[California State Route 99|Route 99E]] through town in the early 1960s, the founding of [[Sierra Nevada Brewing Company]] in 1979—what would become one of the top breweries in the nation<ref>"Brewers Association Releases Top 50 Breweries of 2016". Brewers Association. March 15, 2017. Retrieved May 26, 2017.</ref>—and the establishment of a "Green Line" on the western city limits as protection of agricultural lands.<ref name="Chico green line 2030 general plan">{{cite web |last1=Snellings |first1=Tim |title=Chico Area Greenline Five-Year Review General Plan 2030 Land Use Element- Action Item LU-A13.1 |url=https://www.buttecounty.net/Portals/10/Docs/PC/2015/2015-10-22/Chico_Area_Greenline_Five_Year_Review_Memo.pdf |website=Butte County |publisher=Department of Development Services |access-date=April 4, 2022}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:CA Chico 20180912 TM geo (image layer) - cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Chico.]]
Chico is at the Sacramento Valley's northeast edge, one of the richest agricultural areas in the world. The [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains lie to the east and south, with Chico's city limits venturing several miles into the foothills. To the west, the [[Sacramento River]] lies {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from the city.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>

Chico sits on the [[Sacramento Valley]] floor close to the foothills of the [[Cascade Range]] to the north and the Sierra Nevada range to the east and south. [[Big Chico Creek]] is the demarcation line between the ranges.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.becnet.org/local-watersheds-101| title =Local Watersheds 101 | last = | first = | date = | website =Butte Environmental Council | publisher = | access-date = August 19, 2023| quote =Big Chico Creek begins its 45 mile journey from a series of springs on Colby Mountain, at the interface between the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Cascade Mountains.}}</ref> The city's terrain is generally flat, with increasingly hilly terrain beginning at the eastern city limits.
[[File:Big_Chico_Creek_in_Upper_Bidwell_Park.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bidwell Park]].]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|27.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|27.7|sqmi|km2}} is land and 0.04% is water.

The city is bisected by [[Bidwell Park]], which runs {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from the flat city center deep into the foothills.

The city is also traversed by two creeks and a flood channel, which feeds the Sacramento River. They are named Big Chico Creek, [[Little Chico Creek]], and Lindo Channel (also known as Sandy Gulch, locally).

The city has been designated a [[Tree City USA]] for 31 years by the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Tree City USA Communities|url=http://www.arborday.org/programs/treeCityUSA/map.cfm| work=arborday.org |publisher=[[Arbor Day Foundation]]|access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Street Trees | website=City of Chico | date=June 15, 2020 | url=https://chico.ca.us/street-trees-0 | access-date=March 1, 2021}}</ref>

Chico is made up of many districts and neighborhoods, including Downtown Chico, the [[South Campus Neighborhood|South Campus]] neighborhood, and [[Barber, California|Barber]].

==Economy==
[[File:Chico State Science Building in March 2022-02699.jpg|thumb|left|[[California State University, Chico]] Science Building.]]
Much of the local economy is driven by the presence of Chico State. Industries providing employment: educational, health and social services (30.3%), retail trade (14.9%), arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services (12.6%).

Chico's downtown is a thriving area for unique, independent retail stores and restaurants. Farmers markets attract crowds on Saturday mornings and Thursday evenings. City Plaza hosts free concerts regularly during the summer. Performance venues large and small, bars, coffee shops, bookstores, and city offices contribute to a lively and flavorful experience.

Chico has long been a regional retail shopping destination. Chico's largest retail district is focused around the [[Chico Mall]] on East 20th Street. In the two decades since the Chico Mall was constructed, many national retailers have located nearby.
[[File:Hotel Diamond, Chico, CA USA - panoramio (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|W 4th Street in Downtown Chico, with the Hotel Diamond in center.]]
Chico is also home to the North Valley Plaza Mall, the city's first enclosed shopping center. Construction on this mall began in 1965, and it was the county's largest shopping center until the Chico Mall was completed in 1988. For a few years, the "old" mall and the "new" mall competed against one another. The North Valley Plaza Mall was dealt a blow when [[JCPenney]], one of the old mall's anchors, moved to the Chico Mall in 1993. The "old" mall slowly declined with increasing vacancies. After several failed attempts at revitalization, the North Valley Plaza Mall was overhauled in 2002, with the center of the mall demolished.

[[Sierra Nevada Brewing Company]], the largest [[craft brewer]] in the U.S., is based in Chico.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Sierra Nevada Brewery, April 2021.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sierra Nevada Brewing Company]].]]
[[Almond]]s are the number one crop in Chico and the surrounding area, only recently edging out rice. Other crops in the area include [[walnut]]s, [[Kiwifruit|kiwi]]s, [[olive]]s, [[peach]]es, and [[plum]]s.

The city is bounded on the west by orchards with thousands of almond trees, and there are still a few pockets of orchards remaining within the contiguous city limits. The trees bloom with a pink/white flower in late February or early March. Millions of bees are brought in for pollination.

Walnuts are also major agricultural products in the area north and west of town. Unlike the almond crops of the area, walnuts do not have the same appeal as they do not bloom in the spring. However, the trees themselves grow much larger, live longer, and are far more resilient to harsh weather than almond trees, which are known to be sensitive to frost and can be felled easily in winter storms. In the area, Walnuts are harvested following the almond harvest season, beginning in mid to late September and stretching well into October.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.californiawalnutcompany.com/harvest-time/|title=Harvest Time|date=June 14, 2012 |publisher=California Walnut Co.|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref> The walnut variety Chico is named after the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calag.ucanr.edu/download_pdf.cfm?article=ca.v022n04p8|title=Ten new walnut varieties released|publisher=California Agriculture|date=April 1, 1968}}</ref>

In 1998, city voters approved a bond to build a third comprehensive high school that was to be called Canyon View High School.

Commercial passenger flights were discontinued by SkyWest on December 2, 2014, due to nonviability, as indicated by United Airlines in June 2014. The city administration is trying to restore air service, which would be provided by alternate airlines.<ref>Chico Municipal Airport official website</ref> On July 31, 1961, the first-ever [[aircraft hijacking]] on United States soil occurred at the Chico Regional Airport. Two men were critically wounded, and the hijacker was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.<ref>Chico: A 20th century Pictorial History</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Welter|first=Greg|title=First U.S. skyjacking attempt was in Chico, 45 years ago|url=http://www.chicoer.com/news/ci_4116071|access-date=November 4, 2011|newspaper=[[Chico Enterprise-Record]]|date=July 31, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708144005/http://www.chicoer.com/news/ci_4116071|archive-date=July 8, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the early 1980s, the airport was the home base and headquarters for [[Pacific Express]], a scheduled passenger airline that served Chico with [[British Aircraft Corporation]] [[BAC One-Eleven]] twin jets. From 1962 to 2010, the airport was also home to [[Aero Union]], a company that refitted and operated surplus military aircraft such as the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] turboprop as fire fighting aircraft for state and federal agencies until their move to [[McClellan Airfield]], near Sacramento.

Another local airfield is [[Ranchaero Airport]], surrounded by orchards on the west edge of Chico.

An [[List of altitude records reached by different aircraft types|altitude record]] for unmanned gas balloons was set in Chico in October 1972 ({{convert|51.8|km|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The record was broken on May 23, 2002.

''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' was filmed in the foothills outside Chico in July 2019 for the final scenes between the [[F 14|F-14]] and two [[Su 57|SU-57's]], which was performed using two [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39's]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. The film crew spent 10 days filming and secretly used the Chico Airport for a staging area.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Saam |first=Kelly |date=June 16, 2022 |title=Chico's top secret mission in the filming of 'Top Gun: Maverick' |url=https://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/chicos-top-secret-mission-in-the-filming-of-top-gun-maverick/article_1a7ea352-ed72-11ec-81ae-0b8aa75679e1.html |access-date=June 16, 2022 }}</ref>
