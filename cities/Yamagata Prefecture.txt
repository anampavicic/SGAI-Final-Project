{{Nihongo|'''Yamagata Prefecture'''|山形県|Yamagata-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located in the [[Tōhoku region]] of [[Honshu]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Yamagata prefecture" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 1038-1039|page=1038}}; "Tōhoku" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 970|page=970}}</ref> Yamagata Prefecture has a population of 1,028,055 (1 August 2023) and has a geographic area of 9,325 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (3,600 [[Square mile|sq mi]]). Yamagata Prefecture borders [[Akita Prefecture]] to the north, [[Miyagi Prefecture]] to the east, [[Fukushima Prefecture]] to the south, and [[Niigata Prefecture]] to the southwest.

[[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata]] is the capital and largest city of Yamagata Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Tsuruoka, Yamagata|Tsuruoka]], [[Sakata, Yamagata|Sakata]], and [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Yamagata" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 1038|page=1038}}</ref> Yamagata Prefecture is located on Japan's western [[Sea of Japan]] coast and its borders with neighboring prefectures are formed by various [[mountain ranges]], with 17% of its total land area being designated as [[List of national parks of Japan|Natural Parks]].

[[File:Sankyo Warehouse in Sakata, Yamagata, 16 June 2013, 02.jpg|thumb|Sankyo Warehouse in [[Sakata, Yamagata|Sakata City]], related to [[Kitamaebune]] and transport on [[Mogami River]].]]
The aboriginal {{nihongo|[[Ezo]]|蝦夷}} people once inhabited the area now known as Yamagata. Yamagata and [[Akita Prefecture]] were known as [[Dewa Province]] until the [[Meiji Restoration]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}</ref>

During the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), the {{nihongo|[[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]]|藤原}} family ruled the area. Yamagata City flourished during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) due to its status as a castle town and post station, famous for'' beni'' (red [[safflower]] dye used in the production of handspun silk). In 1689, the famous [[haiku]] poet, [[Matsuo Bashō]] visited Yamagata during his five-month trip to the northern regions of Japan.

== Geography ==
[[File:Yamagata-ken géolocalisation relief.svg|thumb|Map of Yamagata Prefecture]]

===Mergers===
{{main|List of mergers in Yamagata Prefecture}}

== Climate ==
The climate of Yamagata Prefecture is characterized by long, hot, and humid summers and long, snowy winters. Both spring and autumn are short, the former often cold, the latter often warm, but both quite dry and sunny. Yamagata Prefecture, along with northern parts of Miyagi and Iwate are the transition areas from [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Cfa''/''Cwa'') to [[humid continental]] within the Japan mainland. Winter temperatures rarely fall below {{convert|-10|°C}} in populated areas; they frequently rise above {{convert|30|°C}} in July and August. Precipitation falls all year round and the remnants of one or perhaps two [[typhoon]]s usually pass through between August and October. The winters see heavy snowfall especially at higher elevations, though the Japan Sea coast ([[Sakata, Yamagata|Sakata]]) is milder and has more rain. Snowfall for [[Shinjō, Yamagata|Shinjō]] is typical of populated mountainous areas, snowfall for [[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata City]] typical of the valleys. The central mountains around [[Mount Gassan|Gassan]] may see as much as {{convert|3000.|cm|ft}} of snow in a season with depths up to {{convert|8|m}} at higher elevations.

==City life==
Yamagata City is the central hub for Yamagata Prefecture and has many shops and restaurants around its main station.  It is also the location with the most western hotels and the primary place of lodging for visitors visiting this region. This city serves as a good hub to visit the surrounding cities and towns around this prefecture with bus lines and train lines linking almost every part of Yamagata from the station.

There are also many bars near the station giving this city a good night life for visitors to enjoy at the front of the station as well as the nanukamachi district in the downtown area of the city. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://thehiddenjapan.com/yamagatacity/ | title=Yamagata City | date=9 May 2022 }}</ref>

===Festivals and events===
Yamagata Prefecture has a number of annual festivals and events.

The largest is the [[Yamagata Hanagasa Festival]] (花笠祭り) which takes place in [[Yamagata City]] on the first weekend in August, when thousands of people perform the hanagasa dance in the city centre and attracts up to 300,000 spectators. Yamagata City is the home of the bi-annual [[Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival]] in October.

In February, a snow lantern festival is held in [[Yonezawa]] at the [[Uesugi Shrine]]. Hundreds of candle-lit lanterns light pathways dug into the snow around the shrine. Yonezawa is also the site of the ''Uesugi Festival'' (上杉祭り, ''uesugi matsuri'') in mid-spring. The festival's highlight is a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Kawanakajima]] on the banks of the Matsukawa River.

In September, Yamagata Prefecture is famous for its [[imoni]], a taro-root stew popular in Northern Japan during the autumn. Imonikai, taro-root soup parties, are very popular during this season, and many tourists come to Yamagata Prefecture specifically for its particular style of imoni.

===Art===
Beginning in 2003, Yamagata city officials with the aid of Tōhoku University of Art and Design began a three-year project in which the Buddhist art of the city's temples would be catalogued and compared to a set of guidelines in order to identify "cultural assets".<ref>{{cite news|title=Yamagata: City unearths wealth of Buddhist Treasure |work=The Asahi Shimbun |date=December 5, 2006 |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200612050117.html }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> One hundred and ninety temples have had their works of art examined and several significant examples of Buddhist sculpture have been discovered. At Heisenji Temple, in the Hirashimizu district, a particularly rare statue, a seated [[Vairocana]] Buddha made from [[zelkova]] wood, was found. Other significant works include sculptures from the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) and [[Kamakura period]] (1192–1333).

The Yamagata Museum of Art, located in Yamagata City, was opened in 1964 through the efforts of a foundation led by Yoshio Hattori, the president of Yamagata Shimbun and Yamagata Broadcasting Co, Ltd. The permanent collection consists of three types of art: Japanese and Asian, regional, and French. Special exhibitions are held periodically.

===Language===
Yamagata Prefecture is known for its local dialect [[Yamagata dialect|Yamagata-ben]], sometimes thought of as backward sounding in other parts of Japan. The 2004 movie ''[[Swing Girls]]'' (スウィングガールズ), co-written and directed by [[Shinobu Yaguchi]], is set in Yamagata and makes use of Yamagata-ben for comedic purposes.

== Tourism ==
The temple of [[Yama-dera]], carved into the mountainside near the city of [[Yamagata, Yamagata|Yamagata]], is a major attraction.

The [[Dewa Sanzan]] are three holy mountains that form a traditional pilgrimage for followers of the [[Shugendō]] branch of Shintō. The famous Gojudo (five-story pagoda) is at the base of [[Mount Haguro]], the lowest of the three mountains.

[[Mount Zaō]] is a famous winter ski resort, also known for its ''snow monsters'' (frozen snow-covered trees) in the winter, and the ''Okama crater lake'', also known as the ''Goshiki Numa'' (Five Color Lake) because its colour changes according to the weather.

[[Ginzan Onsen]] (銀山温泉) is a Silver Mountain hot spring town located in the mountains of [[Obanazawa]] City, Yamagata Prefecture. The area originally developed around a silver mine.
