It is a part of the area covered by [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA).

==Overview==
Bhatpara is situated on the bank of [[Hooghly river]]. It is known for its rich traditions in the field  of [[Sanskrit]] learning. The name 'Bhatpara' originates from the ancient name "Bhatta-Palli", where 'Bhatta' denotes the sect of Bramhin Sanskrit pandits and 'palli' denotes locality or village. It is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal and it was constituted a municipality in 1899, when it was separated from the Naihati municipality. In the British era and afterwards, it had become an important industrial hub on Hoogly river bank, mainly for the high density of jute processing plants.

According to a study carried out by [[Vidyasagar University]], "Most of these industrial units were located in riverine towns. A few of these were old towns inhabited previously by middle-class Bengali 'babus' while others were new towns grown out of agricultural lands... Agriculture in Bengal was more remunerative than work in the jute mills but what the jute mills paid was enough to attract labour from [[Bihar]], [[Odisha]], U.P. first and then from C.P. or even Madras...The industrial 'mohallas' remained as 'ghettos'. There was little or no interconnection or social and cultural contact between the local Bengali population and the millhands. Both lived in their worlds."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://inet.vidyasagar.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/1245/2/2.pdf  | title = Industrialisation and Emergence of Labour Force in Bengal during The Colonial Period: Its Socio-Economic Impact | first = Nirban |last= Basu  | publisher = Vidyasagar University Journal of History, Vol 1, 2012-13  | access-date =  16 July 2018}}</ref>

A significant number of people have also moved out of Bhatpara. (see the Demographics section for the rather dramatic tell-tale data).

==Sports and culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2022}}
Historically Bhatpara is famous as the abode of prominent [[Sanskrit]] pundits and as a seat of learning of ancient [[Hindu]] shastra and [[Vedic]] texts. That aspect of culture has diminished over time. Bhatpara is famous for its [[Durgapuja]]. Although family-based pujas were more common a few decades ago, it has become a community-centric affair in modern times. The youth communities or clubs organise these pujas and due to the sheer number of these clubs, one can find over fifty pujas being arranged within a square kilometre of area. Under Bhatpara Municipality Kankinara is famous for [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and Chatth puja. It is famous for traditional clothes like Punjabi, Sherwani, indo-western dress.

Sahitya Mandir is a West Bengal Government registered and a state-funded public library is situated there.
