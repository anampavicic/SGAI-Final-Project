As of the 2020 census, 3,623,713 people resided within its administrative area of {{convert|27166.37|km2}} and 1,895,865 in its built-up (''or metro'') area consisting of four urban districts. A [[prefecture-level city]], it is the only major city nationally that shares its name with its province.

Jilin City is also known as the ''River City'' because of the [[Songhua River]] surrounding much of the city. In 2007, it co-hosted the [[2007 Asian Winter Games|Asian Winter Games]].

== History ==
Jilin City is one of the oldest cities in Northeast China.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

During the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]] in the [[Ming dynasty]], efforts were made to expand Ming control throughout all of [[Manchuria]]. Mighty river fleets were built and sailed several times from Jilin City, getting the chieftains of the local tribes to swear allegiance to the Ming rulers.<ref name=eu>Shih-shan Henry Tsai, ''The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty''. SUNY Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7914-2687-4}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC Partial text] on Google Books. P. 129–130</ref> 
Soon after the establishment of the Manchu-led [[Qing dynasty]], the territory of today's [[Primorsky Kray]] was put under the administration of Jilin. As the [[Russian Empire]] advanced eastward to the Pacific coast, the Qing government ordered a naval shipbuilding factory to be set up here in 1661. Jilin was officially established as a fort city in 1673 when Anzhuhu ({{lang|zh|安珠瑚}}), the Deputy Lieutenant-General ({{lang|zh-hans|副都统}}), was ordered to build a castle in Jilin. In 1676, the Military Governor of [[Ninguta]] was transferred to Jilin City because of its more convenient location and increasing military importance, while the former Deputy Lieutenant-General was transferred in the opposite direction to Ninguta.<ref name=edmonds>{{cite book|title=Northern Frontiers of Qing China and Tokugawa Japan: A Comparative Study of Frontier Policy|first=Richard Louis|last=Edmonds|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Geography; Research Paper No. 213|isbn=0-89065-118-3|year=1985|pages=113, 115–117}}</ref> Since then Jilin City has developed at a rapid pace. The nickname of Jilin City is ''River City'' ({{lang|zh|江城}}), which originates from one sentence "{{lang|zh-hans|连樯接舰屯江城}}" of a poem written by [[Kangxi Emperor]] when he was visiting Jilin City in 1682.{{cn|date=October 2024}} Jilin retained its importance into the 18th and 19th century as one of the few cities existing beyond the Willow Palisade, along with [[Qiqihar]], [[Ninguta]] and [[Mukden]].{{cn|date=October 2024}}

After [[Manchukuo]] established their capital in Xinjing (present-day [[Changchun]]), Jilin City's importance decreased. By 1940, Jilin's population was 173,624, while Xinjing's population reached 544,202 at the same time.<ref>{{Nihongo2|新京商工公会刊『新京の概況 建国十周年記念發刊』18-19頁}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=January 2020}} Soviet forces captured Jilin during the [[August Storm]] operation.<ref name="Glantz">LTC David M.

Jilin became the provincial capital of Jilin Province after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, until Changchun took this position in 1956.

==Tourism==
[[File:China Jilin City Zhuqueshan National Park 01.jpg|thumb|Zhuqueshan National Park]]
Jilin City is a popular destination for tourists to come each winter to view the magnificent [[rime (frost)|rime ice]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=雾凇 |t=霧凇}}) on trees along the banks of the Songhua River, (the river is the only river in the region that does not freeze in winter). The rime ice is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year during January and February.{{cn|date=October 2024}} It is a result of water vapor rising up from the warm Songhua River to meet the cold {{convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on}} night air, causing the crystallisation of water vapour on willows branches.{{cn|date=October 2024}}
