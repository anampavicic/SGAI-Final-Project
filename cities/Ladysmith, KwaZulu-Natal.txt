'''Ladysmith''' is a city in the [[Uthukela District Municipality|Uthukela District]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]], South Africa. It lies {{convert|230|km|mi}} north-west of [[Durban]] and {{convert|365|km|mi}} south-east of [[Johannesburg]]. Important industries in the area include food processing, textiles, and tyre production. Ladysmith is the seat for both the [[Alfred Duma Local Municipality]] and [[Uthukela District Municipality]].

The town was named after [[Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith]], also known as "Lady&nbsp;Smith," the Spanish wife of [[Harry Smith (army)|Sir Harry Smith]], the Governor of the [[Cape Colony]] from 1847-1852. It saw numerous actions during the [[Second Boer War]], when after [[Battle of Ladysmith|numerous small skirmishes]] the town [[Siege of Ladysmith|was besieged by Boer forces]] on 2&nbsp;November 1899. After three British attempts to relieve the defenders and one Boer attempt to take the town all failed, the siege was eventually broken on 28&nbsp;February 1900. Both [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] were present at the siege, the former as a [[war correspondent]] and the latter as a stretcher-bearer.

In 1900, the unincorporated town of Oyster Harbour on the east coast of [[Vancouver Island]], British Columbia, Canada, was renamed [[Ladysmith, British Columbia|Ladysmith]] by [[James Dunsmuir]] in honour of the lifting of the siege of Ladysmith.

In 1847, after buying land from the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] king [[Mpande]], a number of [[Boer]]s settled in the area and called it the Republic of Klip River with [[Andries Spies]] as their commandant. The republic was annexed by the British in the same year and on 20&nbsp;June 1850 was proclaimed a township called Windsor.<ref name="ladysmithhistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.ladysmithhistory.com/the-town/|title=Ladysmith History & The Boer War|access-date=2008-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224014849/http://www.ladysmithhistory.com/the-town/|archive-date=2013-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 11&nbsp;October 1850, the name was changed to Ladysmith after [[Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith]], also known as "Lady&nbsp;Smith," the Spanish wife of [[Harry Smith (army)|Sir Harry Smith]], the Governor of the [[Cape Colony]] and high commissioner in South Africa from 1847 to 1852.

Following the battles, while British forces under White regrouped in the town, the Boers surrounded Ladysmith. The [[siege of Ladysmith]] lasted 118&nbsp;days, from 2&nbsp;November 1899 to 28&nbsp;February 1900, during the most crucial stage of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_ladysmith.html|title=Siege of Ladysmith, 2&nbsp;November 1899 – 27&nbsp;February 1900|last=Rickard|first=J|date=2007-02-05|access-date=2008-10-21}}</ref>

Three attempts by General Sir [[Redvers Buller]] to break the siege resulted in Boer victories at the battles of [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]], [[Battle of Spion Kop|Spion Kop]] and [[Battle of Vaal Krantz|Vaal Krantz]]. On 6&nbsp;January 1900, Boer forces under Commandant-General [[Piet Joubert]] attempted to end the siege by taking the town before the British could launch another attempt to break the siege. This led to the [[battle of Platrand]] (or Wagon Hill) south of the town. British forces under Buller finally broke the siege on 28&nbsp;February 1900 after defeating the Boers by using close cooperation between his infantry and artillery. [[Winston Churchill]], then a young war correspondent for ''[[The Morning Post]]'' of London, was present at the relief of Ladysmith after having been taken prisoner (between Ladysmith and Colenso) and escaping earlier during the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26198/26198-8.txt |title=From the Commencement of the War to the Battle of Colenso, 15th Dec. 1899 |last=Creswicke|first=Louis |work=South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 6) |publisher=Project Gutenberg |access-date=2008-09-08}}</ref><ref>

Ladysmith is located on the banks of the [[Klip River]] ("stone river"), with the central business district and a large part of the residential areas located within the flood basin of the river. It is on the foothills of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains, about 26&nbsp;km from the [[Van Reenen's Pass]]. The town has a [[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with warm summers and cool, dry winters. It borders on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''). The average annual precipitation is {{convert|639|mm|0|abbr=on}}, with most rainfall occurring during summer.

Since it was established the town has suffered severely from flooding of the [[Klip River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Klip River]].

Ladysmith is served by a small airport, {{airport codes|LAY|FALY}} is located on the outskirts of town just below Platrand at {{coord|28|34|48|S|29|45|10|E |region:ZA_type:airport |name=Ladysmith Aerodrome}}.

The [[N11 road (South Africa)|N11]] links Ladysmith with [[Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal|Newcastle]] in the north and with the [[N3 (South Africa)|N3 Freeway]] in the south-west, while the [[R103 road (South Africa)|R103]] provides access to [[Colenso, KwaZulu-Natal|Colenso]] in the south and the [[N3 (South Africa)|N3 Freeway]] in the west. Traffic traveling between [[Durban]] and [[Johannesburg]] used to pass through Ladysmith up until the late 1980s, but the completion of the [[N3 (South Africa)|N3 Toll Highway]], bypassing Ladysmith {{convert|15|km|mi}} to the west, has caused a dramatic drop in traffic volumes through this town as well as others that are now bypassed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eskom.co.za/content/BVLine_Appendix8_Archaeology.pdf |title=Heritage Impact Assessment of Braamhoek Integrated Power Supply Project |publisher=eThembeni Cultural Heritage |page=8 |access-date=2010-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051001/http://www.eskom.co.za/content/BVLine_Appendix8_Archaeology.pdf |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In that regard, the old main road through Ladysmith is now designated as the [[R103 (South Africa)|R103]].

The only sold local newspaper in Ladysmith is the ''Ladysmith Gazette''. It is believed to have been established in 1902, and is part of the Caxton Group of newspapers.

A large number of the [[Second Boer War]] Battlefields around Ladysmith have been preserved as memorial sites.

The Burgher Memorial on Wagon Hill, a sculpture of six hands pointing upwards and one downwards,  was erected in 1979 in honour of 781 Boer forces killed in the battles in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] during the [[Second Boer War]].

[[File:South Africa-Ladysmith-Sufi Mosque-01.jpg|thumb|left|Soofi Mosque]]
[[Christianity]] has a strong presence in and around Ladysmith. It can be seen through the places of worship built around the time of the Anglo Boer wars. One such structure includes the Anglican All Saints Church, built in 1902 from cut flagstones from a quarry in the area. [[Islam]] also has a strong presence in the town, which is well known for the Soofie Mosque on the banks of the [[Klip River]]. Built in 1969, it is regarded as one of the finest in the country. The origins of the structure date back to 1895 when [[Hazrath Soofie Saheb]] arrived in South Africa. He made it his mission to build as many as 12 mosques along the east coast of Durban. Ladysmith was also the home of a revered saint known as [[Hazrath Soofie Sayed Mahomed Abed Mia Osmani]], who is buried in the Ladysmith Muslim Cemetery.<ref name="HKN-Soofi">{{cite web|url=http://www.amafa.co.za/sites/visit/ladysmith/soofi-mosque.html  |title=Soofi Mosque |location=Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa |publisher=[[Heritage KwaZulu Natal]]|access-date=18 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Browne|first=James Stark|title=Through South Africa with the British Association|year=1906|publisher=J Speirs|location=London|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/throughsouthafr00sciegoog#page/n110/mode/2up/search/mosque|page=73|chapter=The Battlefields}}</ref>

For [[Hinduism]], Sanathan Dharma Sabha was inaugurated to promote religious, social, cultural and education activities in Ladysmith in 1902. The oldest Hindu temple resulted from the amalgamation of Hindu Thirukootam (1910) with the Shree Ganaser Temple and hall erected in 1916. It was declared a national monument in November 1990. The present site of the SDS temple (Sanathan Dharma Sabha aka Lord Vishnu Temple) also housed Mahatma Gandhi who established a non-White Stretcher-bearer service in the Ambulance Corps in the Ladysmith and Spioenkop during the Anglo-Boer War.

There are also [[Rastafari]]an devotees within the areas surrounding Ladysmith, residing in Waters Meet, Peace Town, eZakheni, Steadville, Saint Chads, Acaciaville and Roosbom.
