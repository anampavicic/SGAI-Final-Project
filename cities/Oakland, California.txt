'''Oakland''' is a city in the [[East Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. It is the [[county seat]] and most populous city in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], with a population of 440,646 in 2020.<ref name="QuickFacts" /> A major [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] port, Oakland is the most populous city in the East Bay, the third most populous city in the Bay Area, and the eighth most populous city in California. It serves as the Bay Area's trade center: the [[Port of Oakland]] is the busiest port in [[Northern California]], and the fifth- or sixth-busiest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portofoakland.com/port/history/ |title=Port of Oakland – History |access-date=January 31, 2018 |publisher=[[Port of Oakland]]}}</ref>  A [[charter city]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/PDFS/city_b_day_may_2002.pdf|title=Legal Briefs|publisher=City of Oakland Office of the City Attorney|access-date=March 19, 2015|date=May 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924054030/http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/PDFS/city_b_day_may_2002.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Oakland was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] on May 4, 1852, in the wake of the state's increasing population due to the [[California gold rush]].<ref name="baker_incorporation_date">{{cite book |author=Joseph Eugene Baker |title=Past and present of Alameda County, California |volume=1 |date=1914 |publisher=S.J.

Its land served as a resource when its hillside oak and [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] timber were logged to build [[San Francisco]].<ref name="baker_oak_redwood"/> The fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the 1850s, what became the first campus of the [[University of California]] was founded in Oakland, and Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the [[First transcontinental railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869.<ref name="baker_city_growth">{{cite book |author=Joseph Eugene Baker |title=Past and present of Alameda County, California |volume=1 |date=1914 |publisher=S.J.

Following the catastrophic [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], many San Francisco citizens moved to Oakland, enlarging the population, increasing its housing stock, and improving its infrastructure. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its port, [[shipyard]]s, and manufacturing industry. In the 21st century, between 2019 and 2023, after the city and county refused requests for hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits to the privately owned teams, Oakland became the first city to lose three American professional major league sports teams to other cities within a span of five years.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Draper |first=Kevin |date=2024-08-24 |title=Teams Leave, but Oakland Still Finds Reasons to Cheer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/business/oakland-sports-teams-roots-ballers.html |access-date=2024-08-25 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name="OaklandExodus1">{{cite news|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/oakland-pro-sports-team-loss-athletics-las-vegas-fan-reaction|title=Oakland unbelievably lost all three of its pro sports teams in just 5 years|author=Robert Zeglinski|newspaper=USA TODAY SPORTS|date=April 20, 2023|access-date=May 22, 2024}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Oakland, California}}
{{For timeline}}

===Ohlone era ===
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Huchiun natives, who lived there for thousands of years. The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the [[Ohlone]] (a [[Miwok]] word meaning "western people").<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/ |title = Ohlone Tribal Regions Map |access-date=April 15, 2007 |last=Milliken |first=Randall |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813110544/http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = August 13, 2007}}</ref> In Oakland, they were concentrated around [[Lake Merritt]] and [[Temescal Creek (Northern California)|Temescal Creek]], a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]].

===Spanish and Mexican eras===
[[File:Peralta Family.jpg|thumb|left|Oakland and much of the [[East Bay]] was part of [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]], granted to [[Luís María Peralta]] in 1820. Here the Peralta family is pictured at their hacienda in Oakland, c. 1840.]]
In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was colonized, along with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the king of [[Spain]]. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area to [[Luis María Peralta]] for his [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]. The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oakland-california.co.tv/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411053608/http://oakland-california.co.tv/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2011 |title=Oakland-california.co.tv |publisher=Oakland-california.co.tv |access-date=April 19, 2012 }}</ref> Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons.

Adams, 1932 |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |access-date=November 26, 2013}}</ref>

According to [[Stanford University]] historian Albert Camarillo, the Peralta family struggled to keep their land after the incorporation of California into the United States after the [[Mexican–American War]]. Camarillo claims the family was the victim of targeted [[racial violence]]. He writes in ''Chicanos in California'', "They lost everything when squatters cut down their fruit trees, killed their cattle, destroyed their buildings, and even fenced off the roads leading to the rancho. Especially insidious were the actions of attorney [[Horace Carpentier]], who tricked Vicente Peralta into signing a 'lease' which turned out to be a mortgage against the 19,000-acre rancho. The lands became Carpentier's when Peralta refused to repay the loan he believed was fraudulently incurred. The Peraltas had no choice but to abandon the homesite they had occupied for two generations."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Camarillo |first1=Albert |title=Chicanos in California: A History of Mexican Americans in California |date=1979 |publisher=Boyd & Fraser |isbn=978-0878351282 |page=16 |edition=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/chicanosincalifo00albe |access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] constructed the [[Oakland Long Wharf]] at Oakland Point, the site of today's [[Port of Oakland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11745239/how-have-a-bunch-of-19th-century-victorians-survived-in-downtown-oakland|title=How Old Oakland's Historic Buildings Survived Decay (and Demolition)|last=Levi|first=Ryan|date=May 9, 2019|website=KQED|language=en-us|access-date=May 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510034123/https://www.kqed.org/news/11745239/how-have-a-bunch-of-19th-century-victorians-survived-in-downtown-oakland|archive-date=May 10, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A number of [[horsecar]] and [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]] lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric [[streetcar]] set out from Oakland to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by [[Francis "Borax" Smith]] and consolidated into what eventually became known as the [[Key System]], the predecessor of today's publicly owned [[AC Transit]].

Oakland was one of the worst affected cities in California that was impacted by the [[San Francisco plague of 1900–1904]]. [[Quarantine]] measures were set in place at the Oakland ports requiring the authorities at the port to inspect the arriving vessels for the presence of infected rats.<ref name="QuarantineNYT">{{cite news|title=Quarantine Ordered Against Bubonic Rats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/01/01/archives/quarantine-ordered-against-bubonic-rats-vessels-from-three.html|date=1925|work=[[The New York Times]]|id={{ProQuest|103474660}}}}</ref> Quarantine authorities at these ports inspected over a thousand vessels per year for plague and yellow fever.

At the time of incorporation in 1852, Oakland had consisted of the territory that lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to [[industrialization|industrial]] prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902. This resulted in the nearby town of [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] being made an island. In 1906, the city's population doubled with refugees made homeless after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire.

In 1908, the lawyer, former miner, and newspaper owner Homer Wood (1880–1976) suggested to his friend Frank Bilger of Blake and Bilger Rock Quarry and Paving Company that he organize a gathering to establish a [[Rotary Club]] east of the bay. On November 27, 1908, Homer took a ferry across the bay in a driving rainstorm and met for lunch with Frank and twenty three other businessmen at the Hotel Metropole at 13th and Jefferson. This gathering became the first meeting of the Tri-City Rotary Club, renamed in 1911 The Rotary Club of Oakland, the third Rotary Club in the world. This group established the tradition of weekly meetings, something most clubs worldwide follow today.<ref>Hamilton, Linda Parker, ''The Rotary Club of Oakland, A Century of Service and Friendship'', Stories to Last. {{ISBN|978-0-615-57936-8}}</ref>

During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Oakland's [[Moore Dry Dock Company]] expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100&nbsp;million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District, and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.<ref>{{cite web|title=H.G.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] called on defense industries with government contracts to integrate their workforces and provide opportunities for all Americans. Tens of thousands of laborers came from around the country, especially poor whites and blacks from the Deep South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, as well as Missouri and Tennessee. [[Henry J. Kaiser]]'s representatives recruited [[sharecroppers]] and [[tenant farmers]] from rural areas to work in his shipyards. African Americans were part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] by which five million persons left the South, mostly for the West, from 1940 to 1970. White migrants from the [[Jim Crow]] South carried their racial attitudes, causing tensions to rise among black and white workers competing for better-paying jobs in the Bay Area.

Oakland is in the eastern region of the [[San Francisco Bay]].

The [[United States Census Bureau]] says the city's total area is {{convert|78.0|sqmi|km2}}, including {{convert|55.8|sqmi|km2}} of land and {{convert|22.2|sqmi|km2}} (28.48 percent) of water.

Oaklanders refer to their city's terrain as "the flatlands" and [[Oakland Hills, Oakland, California|"the hills"]]. Until recent waves of gentrification, these terms also symbolized Oakland's deep economic divide, with "the hills" being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and hills of the East Bay range.

Ruptures along the nearby [[San Andreas Fault]] caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989. San Andreas quakes induces [[Aseismic creep|creep]] (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar98_99/node22.html |title=Modeling surface creep on the Hayward fault using rate-and-state friction |first1=David |last1=Schmidt |first2=Roland |last2=Bürgmann |year=1999 |work=The Berkeley Seismological Laboratory |publisher=The Regents of the University of California |access-date=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211802/http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar98_99/node22.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]]. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the [[Oakland Point, Oakland, California|Oakland Point]], and encompassing the [[Port of Oakland]].

Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including [[downtown Oakland|downtown]] and [[Grand Lake, Oakland, California|Grand Lake]].

The city of [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]], incorporated in Oakland's central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city surrounded by the city of Oakland.

===Climate===

Oakland has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb'') with an average of 260 sunny days per year. In general, the city features warm, dry summers, and cool, wet winters.

Based on data gathered by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oaklandchamber.com/relocation/facts.asp |title=Relocation information: Oakland Facts |publisher=Chamber of Commerce |access-date=July 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903163216/http://www.oaklandchamber.com/relocation/facts.asp |archive-date=September 3, 2011 }} As published in 1993 by Rand McNally.</ref> Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters are cool and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] means the northern part of the city can have cooling [[San Francisco fog|maritime fog]]. It is far enough inland that the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].

The [[U.S. Weather Bureau]] kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record high temperature was {{convert|104|°F}} on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was {{convert|24|°F}} on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore "Diablo" winds (similar to the [[Santa Ana winds]] of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes.

[[File:Monthly Climate Normals (1991-2020) - OAKLAND MUSEUM,CA.svg|thumb|right|Climate chart for Oakland]]
Oakland, like much of Northern California, is susceptible to winter rainstorms and [[Atmospheric river]]s. The wettest “rain year” was from July 1997 to June 1998 with {{convert|47.76|in|mm|1}} and the driest from July 2020 to June 2021 with {{convert|8.03|in|mm|1}}. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|15.35|in|mm|0}} in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|4.75|in|0|}} on December 31, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca6332 |title=Oakland, California&nbsp;– Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=April 19, 2012}}</ref> Rainfall near the bayfront is only {{Convert|23|in}}, but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to {{Convert|30|in|disp=sqbr}}), with nearly all precipitation falling between November and April.

Overnight lows are mild. Oakland seldom experiences warm nights with the warmest recorded night of {{convert|72|F|C}} in September 1971 and an average of {{convert|64|F|C}} for the annual warmest low.<ref name=OaklandNOAA>{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=mtr|title=NOWData, San Francisco, CA, NOAA forecast office|publisher=[[NOAA]]|access-date=July 26, 2022}}</ref> The coldest day of the year averages a mild {{convert|50|F|C}} and has never been recorded below {{convert|36|F|C}}.<ref name=OaklandNOAA/>

===Vegetation===
The higher rainfall in the hills supports woods of oak, madrona, pine, fir and a few redwood groves in the wetter areas. Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest redwood trees in California (used for navigation by ships entering the Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump {{Convert|30|feet}} in diameter can be seen near Redwood Regional Park. Sunny, drier slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush. [[Eucalyptus globulus|Australian eucalyptus trees]] have been extensively planted in many areas, as they come from a similar climate.

In the 2000 census, 2,650 lesbian couples identified as such in Oakland; one in every 41 Oakland couples identified as a same-sex female partnership.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/27/BAGDLKQ5EU1.DTL Lesbians Step Out With Pride]: DeFao, Janine] ''San Francisco Chronicle'', August 27, 2006</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2000 Census information on Gay and Lesbian Couples, by Incorporated place Incorporated place, by highest percentage|url=http://www.gaydemographics.org/USA/2000Census_Gay_incorporated.htm|publisher=www.gaydemographics.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020609210811/http://www.gaydemographics.org/USA/2000Census_Gay_incorporated.htm|archive-date=June 9, 2002 }}</ref>

=== Gentrification ===
As of 2020, the San Francisco-Oakland Metro shows indications of having the greatest intensity of gentrification nationally, with over 31% of eligible neighborhoods gentrifying. Gentrifying neighborhoods showed significant increases in median home value, median household income, percentage of college educated residents, but also in economic inequality.<ref name="N2020">{{Cite web|title=Gentrification and Disinvestment 2020 » NCRC|url=https://ncrc.org/gentrification20/|access-date=November 3, 2020|website=NCRC|date=June 17, 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Historically low-income neighborhoods have been rapidly changed by new, higher-income residents as high-wage tech workers and expensive housing have continued to push lower-wage residents out of Oakland.<ref name="N2020"/> In West Oakland, for example, median household income rose from $80,700 to $86,300 between 2010 and 2017, while the percent of population with four-year degrees rose from one-third to nearly one-half, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 18, 2020|title=Oakland, S.F. neighborhoods fastest gentrifying in U.S.|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/oakland-s-f-neighborhoods-fastest-gentrifying-in-u-s|access-date=November 3, 2020|website=The Mercury News|language=en-US}}</ref>

Big tech companies have continued to transform the communities and culture of Oakland as modern apartments have appeared, housing prices have spiked, and many prior working-class residents have moved to suburbs further inland.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Levin|first=Sam|date=July 2, 2019|title='There's no way to stop this': Oakland braces for the arrival of tech firm Square|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/02/theres-no-way-to-stop-this-oakland-braces-for-the-arrival-of-tech-firm-square|access-date=November 3, 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

According to 2015 data compiled by the Bay Area Equity Atlas, 91% of low-income households of color were either in neighborhoods that were gentrifying or were at risk of gentrification at the time.<ref name="bayareaequityatlas.org">{{Cite web|title=Gentrification risk {{!}} Bay Area Equity Atlas|url=https://bayareaequityatlas.org/indicators/gentrification-risk#/?geo=07000000000653000|access-date=November 3, 2020|website=bayareaequityatlas.org}}</ref> The number was higher for individual low-income communities, with 96% of Native American households in neighborhoods that either experienced gentrification or were at risk of being gentrified, followed by Latino households at 94%, Black households at 92%, and Asian or Pacific Islander households at 88%.<ref name="bayareaequityatlas.org"/>

A 2014 study by the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Law & Social Policy at the [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law]] examined crime in the city from 1987 to 2012 and concluded that  "The story of crime in Oakland over the last 25 years is a nuanced one, as there are both positive and negative aspects of the crime trends."<ref name=WarrenInstitute>Bobby McCarthy & Sarah Lawrence, [https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Crime_Trends_in_the_City_of_Oakland_-_A_25-Year_Look.pdf Crime Trends in the City of Oakland: A 25-Year Look (1987–2012).], Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Law & Social Policy, University of California, Berkeley School of Law.</ref> Crime [[Crime drop|dramatically decreased since the early 1990s]] but the city has continued to suffer from serious [[violent crime]] problems.<ref name=WarrenInstitute/> Crime trends generally tracked comparison cities of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] "in terms of direction if not magnitude"; this suggested that crime trends are regional rather than city-specific.<ref name=WarrenInstitute/>

A 2007 journal article identified crime in Oakland as being fueled by the dramatic increase of street narcotics sales and use since the 1970s, with Oakland becoming a major west-coast hub for heroin and cocaine distribution. Subsequent battle for control over the lucrative narcotics trade incited gang conflicts and violence, with shootings becoming a regular occurrence. A concurrent rise in rape, robbery, burglary, auto-theft and other crimes occurred as well. Prior to 1960, there had been successful government-funded social programs whereby rebellious teens were enrolled in youth centers that would teach them proper values and improve their behavior. Similar programs since then have been inconsistent.<ref name="Rosen 2007 255–270">{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Eva|author2=Sudhir Venkatesh |title=Legal Innovation and the Control of Gang Behavior|journal=[[Annual Review of Law and Social Science]]|date=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=255–270|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112724}}</ref>

By the 1970s, the police and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) used [[military tactics]] such as SWAT teams, infiltration and counter intelligence in an attempt to counter groups such as the Black Panthers (responsible for several police ambushes), the S.L.A. and organized drug gangs such as the "69 Mob", with increases in arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment.<ref name="Rosen 2007 255–270"/> During the first decade of the 21st century, Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States.<ref name="sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com">{{cite news |title=Oakland Moves From 3rd To 5th In Most Dangerous City Survey |agency=[[Bay City News]] |publisher=[[CBS San Francisco]] |date=November 22, 2010 |url= http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2010/11/22/oakland-moves-from-3rd-to-5th-in-most-dangerous-city-survey/ |access-date=October 29, 2011}}</ref>

Among Oakland's 35 police patrol beats, violent crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods. In 2008, homicides were concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, although these districts have 44% of Oakland's residents.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spiker |first1=Steve |last2=Garvey |first2=John |last3=Arnold |first3=Kenyatta |last4=Williams |first4=Junious |title=Homicides in Oakland |publisher=Urban Strategies Council |date=March 9, 2009 |url=http://www.urbanstrategies.org/programs/infotech/documents/2008_Homicide_Report.pdf |access-date=October 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003093648/http://www.urbanstrategies.org/programs/infotech/documents/2008_Homicide_Report.pdf |archive-date=October 3, 2011 }}</ref>

[[Gertrude Stein]] wrote about Oakland in her 1937 book ''[[Everybody's Autobiography]]'' "There is no there there", upon learning that the neighborhood where she lived as a child had been torn down to make way for an [[industrial park]]. The quote is usually misconstrued to refer to Oakland as a whole.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=LeBeau |first1=Eleanor |year=2006 |title=Sampling Oakland |journal=Art Papers |issue=Nov/Dec |page=68 |url=http://getthisgallery.com/reviews/de_jesus.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306083037/http://www.getthisgallery.com/reviews/de_jesus.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 6, 2007 |access-date=June 12, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oaklandlocal.com/article/here-where-gertrude-stein-quote-ends |title=Here is where the Gertrude Stein quote ends |author=Ward, Jennifer Inez |date=April 2, 2010 |publisher=Oakland Local |access-date=June 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406024659/http://oaklandlocal.com/article/here-where-gertrude-stein-quote-ends |archive-date=April 6, 2010 }}</ref>

Modern-day Oakland has made steps to rebuke Stein's claim with a statue downtown titled ''There''. In 2005 a sculpture called ''HERETHERE'' was installed by the City of Berkeley on the Berkeley-Oakland border at Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The sculpture consists of eight-foot-tall letters spelling "HERE" and "THERE" in front of the [[BART]] tracks as they descend from their elevated section in Oakland to the subway through [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=HERETHERE |url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=19660 |publisher=City of Berkeley, Office of Economic Development |date=May 19, 2005 |access-date=June 12, 2011 |archive-date=May 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505032017/http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=19660 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Oakland's former baseball team, the [[Oakland Athletics]] of [[Major League Baseball]] won three consecutive [[World Series]] championships in 1972, 1973, and 1974, and appeared in another three consecutive World Series from 1988 to 1990, winning their fourth championship in 1989. Currently based at the [[Oakland Coliseum]], the Athletics announced plans to move to [[Las Vegas]] to play at [[New Las Vegas Stadium|a new 33,000-seat partially retractable ballpark]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] with the team itself spending three seasons at [[Sutter Health Park]] in [[West Sacramento]] as a temporary home. The move leaves Oakland without a major professional sports team for the first time since 1959.<ref name="OaklandExodus" />

Oakland's former football team, the [[History of the Oakland Raiders|Oakland Raiders]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), won [[Super Bowl XI]] in 1976 and [[Super Bowl XV]] in 1980, during their tenure in Oakland. The Raiders [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|relocated to Las Vegas]] in 2020 and are now known as the [[Las Vegas Raiders]].

Oakland's former basketball team, the [[Golden State Warriors]] won the [[1975 NBA Finals|1974–75]], [[2015 NBA Finals|2014–15]], [[2017 NBA Finals|2016–17]],  and the [[2018 NBA Finals|2017–18 NBA championships]], while losing in 2016 and 2019. The Warriors, whose primary owners reside in Southern California, announced in April 2014 that they would leave Oakland once their new arena was built across the Bay in San Francisco. In 2019, the Warriors built and moved to [[Chase Center]] across the Bay. Since the team remained in the Bay Area, they decided not to revert to the San Francisco Warriors name it had in its first stint with the city.

The [[Oakland Roots SC]] are a professional soccer team that was formed in 2018. The Roots began play in 2019 in a new third division professional league known as the [[National Independent Soccer Association]], however, the team announced that it would move into the second division of US professional soccer, and play in the [[USL Championship]] beginning in the 2021 season.
The Roots play their home matches at [[Laney College Football Stadium]].

The [[Oakland Soul SC]], a woman's professional soccer club will begin play in May 2023 as an expansion team in the [[USL W League]]; they will also play their home matches at LCFS.

Oakland's former hockey team, the [[California Golden Seals]] were a professional [[ice hockey]] club that competed in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) from [[1967–68 NHL season|1967]] to [[1975–76 NHL season|1976]]. Based in Oakland, they played their home games at the [[Oracle Arena|Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena]]. The Seals were one of six teams added to the league as part of the [[1967 NHL expansion]]. Initially named the '''California Seals''', the team was renamed the '''Oakland Seals''' during the 1967–68 season and then the '''Bay Area Seals''' in 1970 before becoming the California Golden Seals the same year.
The Seals were the least successful of the teams added in the 1967 expansion, never earning a winning record and only making the playoffs twice in nine seasons of play. Off the ice, they were plagued by low attendance. The franchise was relocated prior to the beginning of the  1976–77 season to become the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]], who would cease operation two years later.

Oakland's [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] team, [[Oakland Spiders]], relocated to Oakland in 2022 after playing eight years as the San Jose Spiders.

==== Funding ====
In 2017, the Oakland Unified School District has received funding from Pandora in partnership with Little Kids Rock, towards expanding music education programs within the schools. The result from these donations has given teachers from 20 additional Oakland- area schools the ability to participate in an eight-hour professional development workshop, and receive music education instruction from Little Kids Rock. The donation includes providing new instruments, that will benefit over 2,000 Oakland students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.pandora.com/file/4247784/Index?KeyFile=390627585|title=Pandora – Press Release|website=press.pandora.com|access-date=April 14, 2018|archive-date=April 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414235419/http://press.pandora.com/file/4247784/Index?KeyFile=390627585|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Media==

{{Main|List of television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area}}
Oakland is served by major television stations broadcasting primarily out of San Francisco and San Jose. The region's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[Owned-and-operated station|O&O]], [[KTVU]] 2, is based in (and licensed to) Oakland at [[Jack London Square]] along with co-owned [[MyNetworkTV]] outlet [[KICU-TV]] 36 (licensed to San Jose).

Oakland was served by the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', which published its first newspaper on February 21, 1874. The [[Tribune Tower (Oakland)|Tribune Tower]], which features a large clock, is an Oakland landmark. At key times throughout the day (8:00&nbsp;am, noon and 5:00&nbsp;pm), the clock tower carillon plays a variety of classic melodies, which change daily. In 2007, the Oakland Tribune moved its offices from the tower to an East Oakland location, before folding in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEDIANEWS_NEWSPAPER_CUTBACKS?SITE=WSAW&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=MediaNews combining most SF Bay area newspapers into 2 new brands, eliminating 120 jobs |author=Liedtke, Michael |date=August 23, 2011 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=August 27, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===Transportation===

====Air and rail====
[[File:Oakland-International-Airport-Aerial-2.jpg|thumb|[[San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport]]]]

Oakland residents have access to the three major airports of the San Francisco Bay Area: [[San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport]], [[San Francisco International Airport]], and [[San Jose International Airport]]. San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport, within Oakland's city limits, is {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} south of downtown Oakland and serves domestic and international destinations. [[AC Transit]] provides 24-hour service to the airport, and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART's]] [[Oakland Airport Connector]] [[automated guideway transit]] line provides frequent service between the airport and [[Oakland Coliseum station]].

The city has regional and long-distance passenger train service provided by [[Amtrak]], with stations near [[Jack London Square]] and the [[RingCentral Coliseum]]. Amtrak's ''[[California Zephyr]]'' has its western terminus at the nearby [[Emeryville (Amtrak station)|Emeryville station]].

Historically, the city was served by several train companies, which terminated in different terminals. [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]] trains terminated at its Oakland depot, actually located within the city limits of Emeryville at 40th and San Pablo. [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] trains ended at the [[16th Street Station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://localwiki.org/oakland/Railroads|title=Railroads|work=localwiki.org}}</ref> [[Western Pacific Railroad|Western Pacific]] trains ended at the 3rd and Washington station. However, a common feature was that the different railroads continued one more stop to a station at [[Oakland Pier]].<ref>"The California Zephyr" from "Streamliner Schedules", original reference from the 1950 Official Guide of railroads"</ref> From this latter point passengers would ride ferries to San Francisco.

====Bridges, freeways, and tunnels====

Oakland is served by several major highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into three freeways at the [[MacArthur Maze]] freeway interchange: [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] (MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] and eventually to the [[California Central Valley]]; [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]; and the Eastshore Freeway ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]/I-580) runs north, providing connections to [[Sacramento]] and [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], respectively.
[[Interstate 980 (California)|Interstate 980]] (Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland before turning into [[California State Route 24|State Route 24]] (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580. [[California State Route 13|State Route 13]] begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic valley in the [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair District]] before entering [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. A stub of a planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned.

[[File:Cypress structure.jpeg|thumb|Portion of the collapsed [[Cypress Street Viaduct|Cypress Viaduct]] from the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake]]]]

At the time of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], the [[Cypress Street Viaduct]] double-deck segment of the [[Nimitz Freeway]] collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1997–2001. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span.

Two underwater tunnels, the [[Webster Street Tube|Webster]] and [[Posey Tube|Posey]] Tubes, connect the main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. In addition, the [[Park Street Bridge|Park Street]], [[Fruitvale Bridge|Fruitvale]], and High Street bridges connect Alameda to East Oakland over the [[Oakland Estuary]].

In the hills, the [[Leimert Bridge]] crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park Boulevard. The [[Caldecott Tunnel]] carries Highway 24 through the [[Berkeley Hills]], connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott has four bores.

Over the course of three months the city installed "soft closure" barriers consisting of signage, traffic cones, and barricades in over 21 miles of city streets.<ref name=":1" /> While the primary goal at the time was to encourage socially distanced outdoor physical activities like biking, walking, and jogging, the long term implementation of the Slow Streets Program contributed to the city's [[traffic calming]] measures and promoted [[alternatives to car use]] as well.<ref name=":3" />

Although the Slow Streets Program was initially praised for its rapid implementation and prioritization of pedestrian safety, the Oakland Department of Transportation quickly came under fire for its failure to collect feedback that represented the opinions of the diverse range of residents whom the program affected.<ref name=":4" /> The high engagement with online surveys by wealthy white residents initially suggested an almost universally positive reaction to the program.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Sharma Rani|first=Rikha|date=October 8, 2020|title=How Covid-19 Inspired Oakland to Get Real About Equitable Urban Planning|url=https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/entry/how-covid-19-inspired-oakland-to-get-real-about-equitable-urban-planning|access-date=October 28, 2021|website=Next City}}</ref> The disproportionately low number of responses from residents of East Oakland—a largely Black and Latino and low-income area—revealed both the oversight of city officials as well as the shortcomings of urban planning systems' ability to equally benefit different social groups, which consequently perpetuates inequalities like the [[transport divide]].

After the flaws of the feedback forms were brought to light, city planners made concentrated efforts to meet with representatives from different community groups who in turn stressed that simply closing streets to through traffic was not enough to protect pedestrians from dangerous driving.<ref name=":5" /> In response the city expressed its commitment to its local residents calling for [[road traffic safety]] by rolling out Slow Streets: Essential Places, a phase of the program which installed cones and signage at dangerous traffic areas in order to make grocery stores, COVID-19 test sites, and food distribution sites easily and safely accessible.<ref name=":2" />

===Freight rail===

Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP), and to a lesser extent by [[BNSF Railway]] (which now shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland).

Historically, Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal was actually in Emeryville), the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] (who built a pier adjacent to the SP's), and the [[Sacramento Northern Railroad]] (eventually absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983).

===Shipping===

As one of the three major ports on the [[West Coast of the United States]], the [[Port of Oakland]] is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal container transfer]],<ref>''Initial Study: Intermodal Interface Demonstration Project, Port of Oakland, Oakland, California'', Earth Metrics and Korve Engineerning, December 20, 1989</ref> thereby displacing the [[Port of San Francisco]], which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.glennfrancosimmons.com/port-oakland|title=Port Of Oakland, Oakland Estuary|work=Glenn Franco Simmons|access-date=December 7, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208071321/http://www.glennfrancosimmons.com/port-oakland|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Utilities===
[[Public water supply]] and [[sewage treatment]] are provided by [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]] (EBMUD). [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG & E) provides natural gas and electricity service. Municipal garbage collection is franchised to [[Waste Management, Inc]]. Telecommunications and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996#Stated objective|Telecommunications Act of 1996]].

Oakland tops the list of the 50 largest US cities using electricity from renewable sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainlane.us/articles/city_renewable_energy.jsp|title=What is the definition of sustainability, development and resources|work=Tech Stuffed|access-date=August 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723035943/http://www.sustainlane.us/articles/city_renewable_energy.jsp|archive-date=July 23, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
[[File:Alta Bates Summit Medical Center.jpg|thumb|Alta Bates Summit Medical Center]]
Originating in Oakland, [[Kaiser Permanente]] is an [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]] started in 1942, during World War II, by industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]] to provide medical care for [[Kaiser Shipyards]] workers. It is the largest managed care organization in the United States and the largest non-governmental health care provider in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=Consumer-driven health care: implications for providers, payers, and policymakers |last=Zendle |first=Les |author2=Regina E. Herzlinger |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-7879-5258-7 |page=661 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtqchcsFYV8C&pg=PA661}}</ref> It is headquartered at One Kaiser Plaza in Downtown Oakland and maintains a large medical center in the [[Piedmont Avenue, Oakland, California|Piedmont Avenue]] neighborhood.

[[Alta Bates Summit Medical Center]], an East Bay hospital system, maintains its Summit Campus in the neighborhood known as "Pill Hill" north of downtown. Until 2000, it was the Summit Medical Center before merging with Berkeley-based Alta Bates. All campuses now operate under the [[Sutter Health]] network.

[[Alameda Health System]] is an [[Integrated delivery system|integrated]] public [[Integrated delivery system|health care system]] organized as a public hospital authority. It operates five Alameda County hospitals including Oakland's [[Highland Hospital (Oakland, California)|Highland Hospital]] and four primary care medical clinics including Oakland's Highland Wellness Center and Eastmont Wellness Center.

[[Children's Hospital Oakland]] is the primary medical center specializing in [[pediatrics]] in the East Bay. It is a designated Level I pediatric trauma center and the only independent children's hospital in Northern California.

There are also several [[community health center]]s in Oakland.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maizlish|first=Neil A.|date=July 1, 2004|title=Glycemic Control in Diabetic Patients Served by Community Health Centers|journal=American Journal of Medical Quality|volume=19|issue=4|pages=172–179|doi=10.1177/106286060401900406|pmid=15368782|s2cid=11934476}}</ref> Some examples include Lifelong Medical Care, Asian Health Services, and Roots Community Health Center.
