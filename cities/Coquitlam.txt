[[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] explored the region in 1808, encountering the Indigenous [[Coast Salish]] peoples. Europeans started settling in the 1860s. Fraser Mills, a lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River was constructed in 1889, and by 1908 there were 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, pool hall, and a [[Gurdwara|Sikh temple]].

== History ==
{{expand section|date=July 2024}}

The [[Coast Salish]] people were the first to live in this area, and archaeology confirms continuous occupation of the territory for at least 9,000 years. The name ''[[Kwikwetlem First Nation|Kwikwetlem]]'' is said to be derived from a Coast Salish term "kʷikʷəƛ̓əm" meaning "red fish up the river".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Kwikwetlem First Nation|url=http://www.kwikwetlem.com/history___culture|title=History & Culture|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905193405/http://www.kwikwetlem.com/history___culture |archive-date=5 September 2008|access-date=5 March 2009}}</ref>

Explorer [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] came through the region in 1808, and in the 1860s Europeans gradually started settling the area. Coquitlam began as a "place-in-between" with the construction of North Road in the mid-19th century to provide [[Royal Engineers]] in [[New Westminster]] access to the year-round port facilities in [[Port Moody]].<ref name="coqhist">{{cite web|publisher=City of Coquitlam|url=http://coquitlam.ca/business-tourism/tourism/heritage.aspx|title=History and Heritage|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615042021/http://www.coquitlam.ca/business-tourism/tourism/heritage.aspx |archive-date=15 June 2015|access-date=15 February 2009}}</ref>

The young municipality got its first boost in 1889 when Frank Ross and James McLaren opened what would become [[Fraser Mills]], a $350,000, then state-of-the-art [[Sawmill|lumber mill]] on the north bank of the Fraser River. The Corporation of the District of Coquitlam was incorporated in 1891. By 1908, a mill town of 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, pool hall and [[Gurdwara|Sikh temple]]<ref name="sikhtemple">{{Cite news |last=Eagland |first=Nick |date=7 April 2019 |title=Sikh Heritage Month: The South Asian pioneers of Fraser Mills |work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/sikh-heritage-month-the-south-asian-pioneers-of-fraser-mills |access-date=12 April 2019 |archive-date=12 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412010627/https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/sikh-heritage-month-the-south-asian-pioneers-of-fraser-mills |url-status=live }}</ref> had grown around the mill.

Over the next two years, several contingents of [[French Canadian]] mill workers arrived from [[Quebec]], and [[Maillardville]] was born. Named for Father Edmond Maillard, a young [[Oblate]] from France, it became the largest Francophone centre west of Manitoba. Maillardville's past is recognized today in street names, the Francophone education system and [[French immersion]] programs, French-language [[Girl Guides]] and [[Scouting|scouts]], and celebrations such as ''[[Festival du Bois]]''.<ref name="coqhist" /><ref name="festivaldubois">{{Cite web |title=Festival du Bois |url=https://www.festivaldubois.ca/ |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=Festival du Bois |language=en-US |archive-date=15 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815001043/https://www.festivaldubois.ca/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following [[World War II]], Coquitlam and the rest of the Lower Mainland experienced substantial population growth that continues today. The opening of [[Lougheed Highway]] in 1953 made the city more accessible and set the stage for residential growth. In 1971, Coquitlam and Fraser Mills were [[Merger (politics)|amalgamated]], which gave the city a larger industrial base.

Coquitlam's geographic shape can be thought of as a tilted [[hourglass]], with two larger parcels of land with a smaller central section connecting them.

Southwest Coquitlam comprises the original core of the city, with Maillardville and Fraser River industrial sector giving way to the large, elevated, flat-plateaued residential areas of Austin Heights. These older residences, with larger property dimensions, are increasingly being torn down and replaced with newer and larger homes. The Poirier Street area was the city's original recreational centre with the [[Coquitlam Sports Centre]], [[Chimo Aquatic and Fitness Centre]], and sports fields located there, while City Hall was previously located further south in Maillardville.<ref name="cityprof">{{cite web|publisher=City of Coquitlam|url=http://www.coquitlam.ca/Residents/About+Coquitlam/City+Profile/default.htm|title=City Profile|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223002859/http://www.coquitlam.ca/Residents/About+Coquitlam/City+Profile/default.htm |archive-date=23 February 2009|access-date=7 March 2009}}</ref>

The Austin Heights area contains [[Como Lake (British Columbia)|Como Lake]], a renowned urban fishing and recreation area, and headwaters for the Como watershed. The watershed represents one of the last urban watersheds in the Tri-Cities that supports wild stocks of [[coho salmon]] as well as other species at risk such as [[coastal cutthroat trout]] (both sea-run and resident) and bird species such as the [[great blue heron]] and [[green heron]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Como Watershed Group|url=http://www.vcn.bc.ca/cwg/cwgpage/cwgbackgrounder%20ppt.pdf|title=Background|access-date=15 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221103214/http://www.vcn.bc.ca/cwg/cwgpage/cwgbackgrounder%20ppt.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2007 }}</ref> It also contains [[Mundy Park]], one of the largest urban parks in the Metro Vancouver area.

In 1984, the provincial government sold {{convert|57|ha|acre|0}} formerly attached to [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]] to Molnar Developments. Shortly afterward, this land was subdivided and became Riverview Heights, with about 250 single-family homes. The remaining {{convert|240|acre|km2}} of this still-active [[Psychiatric hospital|mental health facility]] has been the subject of much controversy amongst developers, environmentalists, and conservationists. In 2005, the city's task force on the hospital lands rejected the idea of further housing on the lands and declared that the lands and buildings should be protected and remain as a mental health facility.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Riverview Hospital Lands |url=http://www.coquitlam.ca/Residents/About+Coquitlam/Riverview+Hospital+Lands.htm |url-status=dead |access-date=15 February 2009 |website=City of Coquitlam |archive-date=22 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222213853/http://www.coquitlam.ca/Residents/About+Coquitlam/Riverview+Hospital+Lands.htm }}</ref> In May 2021, the Government of British Columbia announced that the Riverview lands had been renamed səmiq̓wəʔelə (pronounced suh-MEE-kwuh-EL-uh), meaning "The Place of the Great Blue Heron".

[[Coquitlam Town Centre]], was designated as a "Regional Town Centre" under the Metro Vancouver's Livable Region Strategic Plan. The concept of a [[town centre]] for the area dates back to 1975, and is intended to have a high concentration of high-density housing, offices, cultural, entertainment and education facilities to serve major growth areas of the region, served by rapid transit service.<ref name="cityprof" /> It is in the town centre that many public buildings can be found, including City Hall, a branch of the [[Coquitlam Public Library]], an [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] station, Coquitlam's main fire hall, the David Lam Campus of [[Douglas College]], the [[Evergreen Cultural Centre]], [[City Centre Aquatic Complex]], [[Town Centre Park]] and [[Percy Perry Stadium]].

In 1989, the provincial government sold {{convert|570|ha|acre|0}} of [[Secondary forest|second-growth forested]] land on the south slope of Eagle Mountain, known locally as ''Eagle Ridge'', to developer Wesbild. This resulted in the closure of [[Westwood Motorsport Park]] in 1990, and the creation of [[Westwood Plateau]], which was developed into 4,525 upscale homes, as well as two golf courses.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Wesbild|url=http://www.wesbild.com/land_development/westwood_plateau.htm|title=Westwood Plateau|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211150526/http://wesbild.com/land_development/westwood_plateau.htm |archive-date=11 February 2009|access-date=15 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=e-Tracks|url=http://www.etracksonline.co.uk/Features/stories/canadaspioneer.html|title=Westwood Racing Circuit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917033702/http://www.etracksonline.co.uk/Features/stories/canadaspioneer.html |archive-date=17 September 2009|access-date=15 February 2009}}</ref>

With new development of the [[Evergreen Extension]] of the [[Millennium Line]] of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] [[rapid transit]] system which began operation in December 2016, Coquitlam's urban development area has again shifted to [[Burquitlam, British Columbia|Burquitlam]] and secondly Burke Mountain. The Burke Mountain area plan is now divided into 4 new neighbourhood plans: Lower Hyde Creek Neighbourhood, Upper Hyde Creek Neighbourhood, Partington Creek, and Smiling Creek.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Northeast Area Plan |url=https://www.coquitlam.ca/planning-and-development/community-plans/northeast.aspx |url-status=dead |access-date=2019-11-10 |website=www.coquitlam.ca |archive-date=21 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021012208/https://www.coquitlam.ca/planning-and-development/community-plans/northeast.aspx }}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Like much of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate type]] ''Cfb''), experiencing mild temperatures and high [[precipitation]]; warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. However, compared to most other cities in the area, precipitation is especially heavy in Coquitlam due to its proximity to the mountain slopes. With westward air moving off the [[Pacific Ocean]], the air is forced to flow up the [[Coast Mountains]] causing it to cool and condense and fall as precipitation, this process is known as [[orographic precipitation]]. The orographic effect is mainly responsible for the massive {{convert|1969|mm|in|abbr=on}} annual average precipitation that Coquitlam receives each year, with most falling as rainfall in the fall and winter months, with {{convert|316|mm|in|abbr=on}} in November; the summer is usually sunny with minimal precipitation with {{convert|60.7|mm|in|abbr=on}} in July. Although the mild temperatures allow for mostly rain to fall during the winter months, occasionally [[snow]] will fall. With a slightly higher elevation compared to the rest of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam receives an average of {{convert|64.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow each year, with it rarely staying on the ground for a few days, adding to a very intermittent snow cover during the winter season.

Coquitlam is also located in one of the warmest regions in Canada where average mean annual temperature is {{convert|10.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Temperatures are warm during the summer months with an average high of {{convert|22.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, and an average low of {{convert|13.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in August. During the winter months, the average high is {{convert|5.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, and the average low is {{convert|0.9|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in December. This relatively mild climate, by Canadian standards, is caused by the warm [[Alaska Current]] offshore and the many mountain ranges preventing the cold arctic air from the rest of Canada from reaching the southwest corner of British Columbia.

On June 28, 2021, Coquitlam reached an all-time high temperature reading of {{convert|41|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, shattering the previous record of {{convert|37.0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coquitlam Historical Weather |url=https://www.worldweatheronline.com/coquitlam-weather/british-columbia/ca.aspx |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=WorldWeatherOnline.com |language=en |archive-date=29 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221129021024/https://www.worldweatheronline.com/coquitlam-weather/british-columbia/ca.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Past Weather in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada — Yesterday or Further Back |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/canada/coquitlam/historic?month=6&year=202 |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=www.timeanddate.com |language=en |archive-date=15 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815051827/https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/canada/coquitlam/historic?month=6&year=202 |url-status=live }}</ref>
