'''Bayamón''' ({{IPA|es|baʝaˈmon}}, {{IPA|es|baʝaˈmoŋ|local}}) is a [[Bayamón barrio-pueblo|city]] and [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. Located on the northeastern coastal plain, it is bounded by [[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico|Guaynabo]] to the east, [[Toa Alta, Puerto Rico|Toa Alta]] and [[Naranjito, Puerto Rico|Naranjito]] to the west,[[Toa Baja, Puerto Rico|Toa Baja]] and [[Cataño, Puerto Rico|Cataño]] to the north, and [[Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico|Aguas Buenas]] and [[Comerío, Puerto Rico|Comerío]] to the south. Part of the [[San Juan–Bayamón–Caguas metropolitan area|San Juan metropolitan area]], Bayamón is spread over 11 [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]] and the [[downtown]] area and [[administrative center]] of [[Bayamón barrio-pueblo|Bayamón Pueblo]]. With a population of 185,187 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], it is the second most populated municipality in the [[Geography of Puerto Rico|archipelago and island]] after the capital of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. 

== Etymology and nicknames ==
Two theories exist about the origin of the name Bayamón. According to one, it was named after the local [[cacique]], ''Bahamon''. The other theory states the name was derived from the [[Taíno language|Taino]] word ''Bayamongo'', which is the native name of the [[Bayamón River|river]] that runs across this region, implying that Bayamón is the area around this main river, which later on became the center of the city's development.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Explore Bayamón, Puerto Rico |url=https://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/bayamon.shtml |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=welcome.topuertorico.org}}</ref>

Bayamón is nicknamed "City of the [[Chicharrón]]" or "[[Pork rind|Pork Rind]] City" (''Ciudad del Chicharrón'') after the popular fried dish, locally known as ''chicharrón volao'',<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bayamón |url=https://puertoricopuebloapueblo.org/bayamon/ |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=Puerto Rico Pueblo a Pueblo |language=es-AR}}</ref> that is often sold as street food.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=boricuaonline |date=2016-12-25 |title=Bayamón, Puerto Rico – Pork Ring City |url=https://boricuaonline.com/en/bayamon-puerto-rico/ |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=BoricuaOnline.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Other nicknames include "City of Cowboys" (''Ciudad de Vaqueros''), after the [[Vaqueros de Bayamón|local sports team]], "City of the Sciences" (''Ciudad de las Ciencias'') after the [[Parque de las Ciencias|popular tourist educational attraction]], and, more recently, ''Ciudad del Tapón'', due to the high amounts of road [[traffic congestion]] there.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Levin |first=Tim |title=The 31 US cities that had the worst traffic in 2019 according to a study |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/us-cities-most-traffic-2019-2020-3 |access-date=November 25, 2021 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==

[[File:PORTO RICO Bayamon (NBY 444111).jpg|left|thumb|Postcard from 1903 depicting Bayamón.]]
The [[Taíno|Taino]], the indigenous peoples who encountered European explorers and settlers, were the long-time settlers in this area. Before the foundation of the municipality, Hacienda Santa Cruz was established near the Bayamón River in 1750. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonist]] Juan Ramírez de Arellano formally established [[Bayamón (barrio), Puerto Rico|Bayamón]] as a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlement on May 22, 1772, on a hill known as ''Alto del Embarcadero''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Municipio de Bayamón |date=2011 |title=Historia de Bayamón |url=https://www.municipiodebayamon.com/baya-system/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/historia-de-bayaman.pdf}}</ref> The establishment of [[Invención de la Santa Cruz Parish|its current parish church]] on that same spot also dates to this year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=EMYM.ORG - Parroquia Invención de la Santísima Cruz en Bayamón |url=https://www.emym.org/parroquias/96.html |access-date=2022-02-07 |website=www.emym.org}}</ref>

In 1821, [[Marcos Xiorro]], an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[Slavery in the Americas|slave]], planned to lead a revolt against the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] owners and the Spanish colonial government in Puerto Rico. The slave conspiracy was revealed and suppressed, but Xiorro became a hero among the slaves. He is part of Puerto Rico's folklore. Marco Xiorro was owned by Vicente Andino, a militia captain who owned a [[sugarcane]] plantation in Bayamón.<ref name="GB">[[Guillermo A.

Puerto Rico was ceded by [[Spain]] in the aftermath of the [[Spanish–American War]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris of 1898]] and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the [[United States Department of War]] conducted a [[census]] of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Bayamón was 19,940.<ref name="OfficeSanger1900">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.

The area became home to numerous factories specializing in textiles, fertilizer, aluminum between 1901 and 1920. During this time the city also became home to financial institutions such as the Puerto Rico Commercial Bank (Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico), the American Colonial Bank, the [[First National City Bank of New York]], the [[Chase Bank|Chase Manhattan Bank]] and the [[Popular, Inc.|Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]]. This developed and strengthened Bayamón's economy and turned it into both an industrial and commercial hub. The city's infrastructure also developed with the establishment of a bigger sewer system.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Historia de la Ciudad de Bayamón|url=https://www.municipiodebayamon.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Historia-de-bayamon-Template-Update-2021.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.municipiodebayamon.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Historia-de-bayamon-Template-Update-2021.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-10|website=Ciudad de Bayamón}}</ref>

This shield is a symbol and synthesis of the history and the values which distinguish the city of Bayamón. The main colors of the shield are blue and silver, representing the waters of the [[Bayamón River]] and recalling that it was on these banks that the first hydraulic sugarcane refinery of Puerto Rico was established in 1549.
