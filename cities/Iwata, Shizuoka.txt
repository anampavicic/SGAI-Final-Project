==History==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}

Iwata is an ancient settlement, and human habitation dates from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, with [[obsidian]] tools and [[midden|shell middens]] having been found. Numerous [[kofun]] burial mounds are also found in the area of the city, which came under the control of the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial dynasty]] around the time of the semi-legendary [[Emperor Seimu]]. The [[Nara period]] [[kokufu|provincial capital]] and [[kokubun-ji|provincial temple]] of [[Tōtōmi Province]] were located in Iwata. During the [[Edo period]], it developed as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tokaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]] and contained [[Mitsuke-juku]], one of the 53 stations on the road.

With the establishment of the modern municipalities system of the early [[Meiji period]] on October 1, 1889, Mitsuke Town within [[Iwata District, Shizuoka]] was established. Later that year, Nakaizumi Town and Ninomiya Village merged to form Nakaizumi Town. These two towns merged on November 1, 1940 with Saikai Village and Tenryū Village to form the new town of Iwata. Iwata was raised to city status on April 1, 1948.

On April 1, 2005, the neighboring towns of [[Fukude, Shizuoka|Fukude]], [[Ryūyō, Shizuoka|Ryūyō]] and [[Toyoda, Shizuoka|Toyoda]], and the village of [[Toyooka, Shizuoka|Toyooka]] (all from [[Iwata District, Shizuoka|Iwata District]]) were merged into Iwata.

==Government==

==Economy==
The economy of Iwata is primarily agricultural and is known for [[green tea]] and [[melon]]s grown in greenhouses, which are called "Iwata melon". The [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] Corporation was founded in Iwata and maintains a strong presence in the city. Yamaha Motor's headquarters is in Iwata. [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]] has a vehicle assembly plant in Iwata.

==Education==
[[Shizuoka Sangyo University]], a private university, is located in Iwata.

[[Shizuoka Professional University Junior College of Agriculture]] a public professional Junior college, is located in Iwata since 2020.

Iwata has 23 public elementary schools and 11 public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has four public high schools operated by the Shizuoka Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates two special education schools for the disabled.
