For air travelers, La Paz is served by [[Manuel Márquez de León International Airport]], with connecting flights to some of Mexico's main cities ([[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico City]], [[Monterrey]], [[León, Guanajuato|Tijuana]]), as well as other destinations across the north-northwest of the country (including [[Chihuahua City]], [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Ciudad Obregón]], [[Culiacán]], [[Hermosillo]], [[Mazatlán]] and [[Querétaro]], among others). Seasonal services to [[American Airlines]] hubs [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], are also provided. Additionally, two [[ferry]] services operate from the port of [[Pichilingue]], outside the city, connecting the [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California Peninsula]] to the eastern mainland at Mazatlán and [[Topolobampo]], [[Sinaloa]] (near [[Los Mochis]]).

Beginning in November 2024, [[Alaska Airlines]] will begin offering twice- to thrice-weekly direct flights between La Paz and [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], with daily flights to [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]], scheduled to begin in February 2025.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 July 2024 |title=Alaska Airlines launches historic routes to La Paz and Monterrey, Mexico from Los Angeles |url=https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/alaska-airlines-launches-historic-routes-to-la-paz-and-monterrey-mexico-from-los-angeles/ |website=AlaskaAir.com |publisher=[[Alaska Airlines]]}}</ref>

The first European known to have landed in Baja California was [[Fortún Ximénez]].<ref name=historychannel>{{cite web|title=Baja California Sur|publisher=History Channel|url=http://www.history.com/topics/mexico/baja-california-sur|access-date=August 13, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811225801/http://www.history.com/topics/mexico/baja-california-sur|archive-date=August 11, 2014}}</ref> In 1533, shortly after the conquest of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Hernán Cortés]] sent two ships, ''Concepción'', under the command of captain and commander of the expedition, {{ill|Diego de Becerra|es}}, and ''San Lázaro'' under Capt. Hernando de Grijalva, to explore the [[South Seas]] of the Pacific Ocean. The ships set out 30 November 1533, to travel north along the coast of [[New Spain]] from present-day [[Manzanillo, Colima]], in search of two ships that had been lost without a trace on a similar voyage the previous year. By 20 December the ships had separated; ''San Lázaro'', which had gone ahead, waited three days for ''Concepción'' and after no sighting of its companion vessel, Capt. Grijalva dedicated himself to exploring the region and discovered the [[Revillagigedo Islands]]. On board the ''Concepción'', Ximénez, the navigator and second in command, led a revolt in which Capt. Becerra was killed in his sleep by Ximénez. Also the crewmen loyal to the murdered captain were attacked and later rebel sailors abandoned both the wounded navigators and the [[Franciscans|Franciscan friars]] accompanying the expedition on the coast of present-day [[Michoacán]].

Ximénez sailed to the northwest following the coast and at some point turned west and reached a bay that is now the port of the city of La Paz. Ximénez thought that he had found an island, and never knew that it was a large [[Baja California Peninsula|peninsula]]. There he met natives who wore few clothes and spoke an unknown language; their culture was very different from that of the inhabitants of the Mexican highlands. The crews of his ships saw the “scantily-clad” women and raped them. The Spaniards soon became aware of the large pearls that the natives extracted from the pearl oysters abounding in the bay, and proceeded to plunder the people and rape the women.<ref name=historiabcs/>

The abuse of the Indian women by the crew and their looting caused a violent confrontation with the natives that ended in the deaths of Ximénez and some of his companions;<ref name=historiabcs/> the survivors withdrew, and sailed erratically for several days until they reached the shores of the present-day [[Jalisco]], where they encountered a [[Subaltern (military)|subaltern]] of [[Nuño de Guzmán]], who requisitioned the ship and took them prisoner.

=== Hernán Cortés arrival in California ===
Having sponsored two exploratory voyages in the South Seas just with some giant pearls samples, Cortés decided to lead a third exploration himself. Annoyed that his enemy, Nuño de Guzmán, had requisitioned one of his ships during the first expedition, Cortés decided to confront Guzmán on his own ground and from there set up the third expedition; consequently he prepared a large force of infantry and cavalry to march on the province of [[Nueva Galicia|New Galicia (Nueva Galicia)]], of which Guzmán was governor.

The viceroy of New Spain, [[Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco|Antonio de Mendoza]], warned Cortés on 4 September 1534, "not to confront he who had requisitioned his ships", a warning which Hernán Cortés ignored, claiming that he had been designated to conquer and discover new territories, and that he had spent more than 100 thousand gold ducats of his own fortune. The feared confrontation between the armies of Cortés and Nuño de Guzmán did not occur.

In Chametla, ([[Sinaloa]]), after crossing the present-day states of [[Jalisco]] and [[Nayarit]], territory then known as part of New Galicia, Cortés and his entourage embarked the ships '' Santa Águeda '' and '' San Lázaro '' with 113 crewmen and 40 cavalrymen with their horses and gear, leaving 60 riders on land, as reported to the [[Real Audiencia]] and Governor Nuño de Guzmán. Cortés then sailed northwest, and on 3 May 1535 arrived at the bay he named ''Bahia de la Santa Cruz'' (Bay of Santa Cruz), currently the port of La Paz,<ref name=historiabcs/> where he confirmed the death of his subordinate, Fortún Ximénez, at the hands of the natives. Once Cortés had taken possession of the bay, he decided to establish a colony and summoned the soldiers and arms he had left in Sinaloa. The transport ships were lost in a storm, however, and only one ship, carrying a load of fifty bushels of corn, returned. This was insufficient to feed the population, so Cortés left to personally secure food, but was unable to procure enough, so he decided to return to New Spain with the intention of supplying the new colony from there.

[[Francisco de Ulloa]] was in command of the town of La Paz, but complaints by relatives of those who had stayed on the peninsula caused the viceroy to order the population to abandon the colony and return to New Spain. Following the failure of Cortés' third expedition to establish a colony in the newly discovered lands that belonged to him by [[royal decree]], an enemy of Cortés, whom a writer of the time cites as Alarcón, [[Origin of the name California#Application of the name|applied the name "California,"]] drawn from [[Las sergas de Esplandián|a contemporary novel]], to the abandoned territory, perhaps in order to insult Cortés.<ref>''Descubrimientos y Exploraciones en las Costas de California 1532–1650'' ("Discoveries and Explorations on the Coasts of California 1532–1650", Madrid, 1947; 2ª edición 1982, pp. 113–141): relevant passage quoted and cited at [http://etimologias.dechile.net/?California Etimología de California] on etimologias.dechile.net.

From 10 January 1854, to 8 May 1854, La Paz served as the capital of [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker's]] [[Republic of Sonora]]. The project collapsed due to lack of US support and pressure from the Mexican government to retake the region.

== Geography ==
[[File:Malecon la paz,b.c.s. - panoramio - Maria de los Angeles….jpg|thumb|Typical La Paz [[monolith]]]]
La Paz is located on the Baja California peninsula on the Bay of La Paz, {{convert|210|km|mi}} south of [[Ciudad Constitución]], municipality of Comondú, and {{convert|202|km|mi}} north of [[Cabo San Lucas]], municipality of Los Cabos. It is located {{convert|81|km|mi}} north of the town of [[Todos Santos, Baja California Sur|Todos Santos]]. Its geographical coordinates are 24°08′32″ N and parallel 110°18′39″W, it has an altitude of 0 to 27 meters above the sea level. It is one of the three state capitals of Mexico that are on the coast of the sea.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Baiadelapaz.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Bay of La Paz, as seen from the [[International Space Station]]. [[El Mogote]] peninsula is visible to the center left.]]

La Paz has a [[desert climate|subtropical desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|BWh]]). The climate of La Paz is relatively consistent with generally little rainfall, with a year around average temperature of between {{convert|17|and|30|C|F|0}}. Summer months (July–September) typically see highs between {{convert|34|and|36|C|F|0}} and dew points of {{convert|21|-|23|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=50467 |title=La Paz, Baja California Sur Travel Weather Averages |access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref> The winter months (December–February) are the coldest with temperatures dropping below {{convert|15|C|F}} at night, but cold mostly are from {{convert|20|to|25|C|F}}. Breezes from Bahía de La Paz moderate the temperature. The bay also acts as a barrier against seasonal storms in the Gulf of California.

Rainfall is minimal at most times of year, although erratic downpours can bring heavy rains.  Rain tends to be concentrated in a short, slightly rainier season that peaks in August and September, following the pattern of the [[North American Monsoon]]. The driest season, where it is common to have no rain, occurs March through June. La Paz averages over 300 days of sunshine annually and an average of 3148 sunshine hours.

During the summer the cooling [[Coromuel]] winds, a weather phenomenon unique to the La Paz area, blow during the night from the Pacific over the Peninsula and into the Bay of La Paz.

As with most of the Gulf of California, the temperature of the water changes substantially over the course of the year, with temperatures around {{convert|68|F|C}} during winter and around {{convert|85|F|C}} during summer.<ref>"The Gulf of California - A Physical, Geological and Biological Study" By Rebekah K.

The population of La Paz has grown greatly since the 2000s.

Eco-tourism is by far the most important source of tourism income in La Paz. Tourists also visit the city's [[balneario]]s. There are some 900 islands and inlets in the Gulf of California with 244 now under [[UNESCO]] protection as World Heritage Bio-Reserves and the [[Isla Espíritu Santo]] group, which borders the northeast portion of the Bay of La Paz, the primary tourist destination of the area.

Industries include [[silver mining]], [[agriculture]], [[fishing]] and [[pearl]]s. Tourism is also an important source of employment for this coastal community.

The now defunct airline [[Aero California]] had its headquarters in La Paz.<ref name="FI">{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | page= 46 | date= 27 March 2007}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Aerpuerto de La Paz, BCS, 201710.jpg|thumb|left|Manuel Márquez de León International Airport]]
La Paz is served by [[Manuel Márquez de León International Airport]] with flights to Mexico's 3 largest cities and the main cities of northwest Mexico on [[Aeroméxico Connect]], [[Volaris]], [[VivaAerobus]], [[Calafia Airlines|Calafia]] and [[TAR Aerolíneas|TAR]] airlines; and [[American Airlines]] seasonal service to its hubs in [[Dallas]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Two [[ferry]] services operate from the port of [[Pichilingue]] outside the city, connecting the Baja California peninsula to the mainland at [[Mazatlán]] and [[Topolobampo]], near [[Los Mochis]].

===Roads===
Running along the coast in front of La Paz is {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long Malecon Road.  The main purpose of this road is to allow easy movement across the city. However, it quickly became the focal point of tourist related activities with a large number of bars, restaurants and shops opening along its length. Since 2004 extensive development has taken place which included a large sidewalk which offers safety for large numbers of people to walk along the coastal front of La Paz.

In September 2011, a bicycle lane was added to Malecon Road, providing cyclists protection from cars and pedestrians.<!--<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amistadrealtors.com/blog/2011/08/31/la-paz-malecon-working-on-bicycle-lane/|title=amistadrealtors.com - This website is for sale! - amistadrealtors Resources and Information.|website=www.amistadrealtors.com|access-date=22 March 2018 }}</ref>-->

La Paz is served mainly by two highways; [[Mexican Federal Highway 1]] that links the south of the state from [[Cabo San Lucas]] to the north of [[Baja California Peninsula|the peninsula]] to [[Tijuana]], and [[Mexican Federal Highway 19]], that connects La Paz with the population of the south pacific towns such as [[Todos los Santos, Baja California Sur|Todos Santos]] and [[El Pescadero]]. It is also served by two secondary roads, the Los Planes highway (286) that connects La Paz with towns such as [[La Ventana]], Ensenada de los Muertos and Los Planes. The other is the Pichilingue highway which links La Paz with its maritime port.

[[File:First meal in La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico (50944797157).jpg|thumb|Machaca, a local dish served for breakfast]]
Local specialties are characterized by seafood dishes, especially of lobster, sole, clams and shrimp. Oregano is frequently used as a spice, and [[damiana]], an ingredient in a traditional [[liqueur]], is widely regarded as an aphrodisiac and brewed as a tea.

Regional cuisine also includes traditional dishes such as [[machaca]], made from beef that has been well-cooked, shredded, and then cooked in its own juices, fresh cheeses and the typical flour tortillas. Abundantly available clams are prepared in various ways such as pickling, breading and frying, or stuffing. Shrimp are plentiful also, and eaten grilled, fried, or baked as in the regional specialty, ''filete imperial de camarones''. Other popular seafood dishes include ''callo garra de león'', made with scallops, fish ''tatemado'', and [[ceviche]].

Regional sweets are represented by fruits such as guava, mango and [[pitaya]], green papaya and fig in syrup, as well as dehydrated regional fruits such as white fig and mango. Cheese empanadas (''empanadas de queso'') and empanadas made with sweet beans are also popular.

According to the Baja California Sur State Development Plan 2005-2011, during 2006 there were 24 deaths due to cervical cancer in the state. The health sector seeks to reduce cervical cancer mortality by providing timely treatment to women aged 25 to 64 years, and improving the efficiency of diagnostic laboratories and the monitoring of patients.

As of 1 March 2021, the municipality reported 11,558 recoveries, 577 active cases, and 436 deaths from the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus – Baja California Sur Situation Report – Información de Coronavirus |url=https://coronavirus.bcs.gob.mx/english/ |website=coronavirus.bcs.gob.mx |publisher=Gobierno de Baja California Sur |access-date=1 March 2021 |language=es}}</ref>
