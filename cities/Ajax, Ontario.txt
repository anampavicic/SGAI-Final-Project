'''Ajax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|dʒ|æ|k|s}}; [[2021 Canadian census|2021 population]]: 126,666) is a waterfront town in [[Regional Municipality of Durham|Durham Region]] in [[Southern Ontario]], Canada, located in the eastern part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]].<ref name="CGNDB" />

The town is named for {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}}, a [[Royal Navy]] [[cruiser]] that served in the [[Second World War]]. It is approximately {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} east of [[Toronto]] on the shores of [[Lake Ontario]] and is bordered by the City of [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] to the west and north, and the Town of [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]] to the east.

==History==
{{main|History of Ajax, Ontario}}

The [[indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples]] were active in the watersheds of the [[Duffins Creek]] and the [[Carruthers Creek (Canada)|Carruthers Creek]] since the [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic period]] (7000-1000 BCE), although they did not build any major settlements in the area, presumably because of the poor navigability of these streams.{{sfn|Harold H. Harvey|2011|p=286}}{{sfn|TRCA Duffins|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|TRCA Carruthers|2002|p=11}} In 1760, [[French Canadians|French]] [[Sulpician]] missionaries from [[Ganatsekwyagon]] reached the Duffins Creek area, but did not settle there.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=115}}

After the [[Conquest of New France (1758–1760)|British conquest of New France]] in 1760, the area became part of the [[Pickering Township]]. Mike Duffin, an Irish [[Fur trade|fur trader]], is the earliest known European to have settled in the area, in the 1770s.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|pp=18,115-116}} The conversion of the main local trail into the [[Ontario Highway 2|Kingston Road]] in 1799 contributed to increased settlement in what is now Ajax.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=117}} In the first half of the 19th century, the [[Pickering Village]], now a neighbourhood in Ajax, evolved as the major population centre of the Township, supported by a timber and agricultural boom. In 1807, [[Timothy Rogers (Quaker leader)|Timothy Rogers]] led [[Quaker]] families to settle in the area, and built [[sawmill|saw]] and [[gristmill|grist]] mills on the banks of the Duffins Creek.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=18,118}} The [[War of 1812]] increased military traffic on the Kingston Road, resulting in a better-maintained road, and leading to further development of the area.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=121}}

In the mid-19th century, [[Audley, Ontario|Audley]], a smaller community, emerged as a stopover on the route to the port of [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]].{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=140}} By the 20th century, much of the area of present-day Ajax had been converted into farmland. In 1926, James Tuckett of [[Toronto]] bought lakeshore farmland, and started the development of the [[Pickering Beach, Ontario|Pickering Beach]] [[holiday cottage|cottage]] community, which later became a permanent settlement.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|pp=154-158}}

After the start of the World War II in 1939, the Government of Canada [[expropriation|expropriated]] most of the farmland in what is now southern part of Ajax, to establish the [[Defence Industries Limited Pickering Works]] munitions plant.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=25}}{{sfn|Ken Smith|1989|p=11}} Operated by [[Defence Industries Limited]] (DIL), the government-owned plant employed workers from different parts of Canada.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|pp=28-29}}{{sfn|Lisa Tubb|2019|p=5}} The plant site, along with the residences and the facilities established for the workers, evolved into a self-contained community, whose residents called it a "village". As part of a contest, the DIL employee Frank Holroyd suggested the name "Ajax" for the community, in honour of the British warship ''[[HMS Ajax (22)|HMS Ajax]]'' which had fought against the powerful [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] battleship ''[[German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee|Admiral Graf Spee]]'' at the [[Battle of the River Plate]] in 1939.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=43}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kitts |first1=Daniel |title=The Second World War created Ajax.

After the plant shut down in 1945, the site was used as a war surplus warehouse and sales outlet,{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=51,75}} a [[University of Toronto Ajax Division|University of Toronto campus]] (1946-1949),{{sfn|Martin L. Friedland|2013|pp=373-374}} and a holding camp for war refugees from Europe (1949-1953).{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=75}} The government mandated the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] (CMHC) to develop the site and its surrounding area into a modern industrial town. George Finley, the CMHC manager of the area, planned new housing subdivisions, commercial centres, and industrial areas.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|pp=63-64}}

In 1950, Ajax was incorporated as an Improvement District, a form of local administration managed by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor]]'s appointees.{{sfn|Robert McGeachy|2006|p=209}} The Improvement District Board created the community's first by-laws and hired employees for the local administration. In August 1954, as a result of a campaign by the Ajax Citizens Association, the [[Ontario Municipal Board]] declared Ajax a town, granting it full municipal status.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|pp=68-69}} The first town  council members were elected on 11 December 1954, and assumed office on 1 January 1955. The first mayor of the town was [[Benjamin de Forest Bayly]], better known as Pat Bayly.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=76}}

In the early 1970s, the [[Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority]] (MTRCA) acquired much of the land along the lakeshore. In the Pickering Beach area, several homes, a church, and a school were demolished to make way for a parkland.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=157}}

{{wide image|Ajax Waterfront Park, Ajax, Ontario.jpg|1000px|Waterfront Park}}

On 1 January 1974, Ajax became a part of the newly formed [[Regional Municipality of Durham]], which manages functions common to multiple municipalities in the region. The boundaries of the town of Ajax were expanded to include several areas of the former Pickering Township, including Pickering Village, Pickering Beach, and Audley.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|p=77}}

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
In 1945, with the closing of D.I.L., there was no industry within the town, but in 1949, [[Dowty Group|Dowty Aerospace]] started operations in Ajax. By 1969, major employers included [[Volkswagen]] Canada, [[DuPont]], Paintplas, Ajax Textile, AEG Bayly Engineering and many others.

Shopping was virtually non-existent in the mid-1940s, but by 1970 major shopping centres such as Ajax Plaza, Harwood Place Mall and Clover Ridge Plaza were constructed. The 1980s saw an expansion of retail shopping malls to include Discovery Bay Plaza, Transit Square, Baywood Plaza, Westney Heights Plaza and most recently the Durham Centre at Harwood Avenue and Kingston Road.

The 1970s saw the beginning of many physical changes to the face of Ajax. New subdivisions spread over vacant land in central Ajax. The early 1980s brought extensive development to the southern part of Ajax with large, upscale housing units constructed along Lake Driveway.

The recession of the early 1980s did not stop residential development in Ajax. Westney Heights started north of Highway 2 and offered home buyers low interest rate mortgages while interest rates were then at an all-time high of 18% to 20%. Development north of Highway 2 stretched from Church Street in Pickering Village to Harwood Avenue, with the Millers Creek development south of the highway down to the edge of [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]].

===Ajax Downs===
Ajax Downs is a [[casino]] that is located on 50 Alexander's Crossing, near the intersection of [[Kingston Road (Toronto)|Kingston Road]] and Audley Road. It has been controversial since the announcement of the [[Durham Live]] casino in 2018. The Ontario premier [[Doug Ford]] had promised to keep the Ajax Downs open after the completion of the casino. In 2022, The Durham Live casino was completed. Although it is referred to as the [[Durham Live|Pickering Casino]], it lies on the border of the two small cities. This marks the first major casino operation in the Greater Toronto Area.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://pickeringcasino.com/get-directions/ | title=Pickering Casino Resort }}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}

===Health care===
The [[Rouge Valley Ajax and Pickering|Ajax and Pickering General Hospital]] first opened in 1954 with 38 adult and children's beds. It was expanded to 50 beds in 1958 and a major expansion to 127 beds took place in 1964. The emergency and outpatient services were expanded in 1975. The large growth of population in the Town has prompted a further expansion. Approval was granted in the fall of 1990 to further expand. In 1999, the Hospital merged with Centenary Health Centre in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] to become part of the [[Rouge Valley Health System]]. Construction on a $60&nbsp;million expansion began in 2007, although that has been marred by the highly controversial closure of the 3 West Mental Health ward in 2008, which was originally to be part of the expansion.

===Emergency services===
The [[Durham Regional Police]] police Ajax from a station in Pickering. [[Durham Region]] provides Ambulance/emergency medical services. Ajax Fire & Emergency Services provides firefighting services from three fire stations.

===Transportation===
[[File:Multi-use recreation trail.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Multi-use trail over Caruthers Creek. The overhead bridge carries a Canadian Pacific rail line.]]
[[Ajax GO Station]] is served by GO Transit's [[Lakeshore East line]], with service from Toronto and Oshawa.

In 1973, the Town of Ajax conducted a survey of potential transit ridership in Ajax. This led to the creation of [[Ajax Transit]] with bus service beginning in 1973 under a contract with [[Charterways Transportation Limited]], which operated service using a fleet of school buses, with heaviest ridership between the Pickering Beach area and downtown Ajax.

In the late 1970s, the town brought the operations in house and began operations on the Elm, Duffins, and Beach routes, which exist to this day. In the early 1980s, the Harwood, Westney Heights, and Village routes began service. Service on the Puckrin route began in the late 1980s.

In 2001, Ajax Transit and the neighbouring [[Pickering Transit]] were amalgamated into the [[Ajax-Pickering Transit|Ajax Pickering Transit Authority]] (APTA), which operated under the joint ownership and oversight of Ajax and Pickering.

In 2006, APTA was amalgamated into [[Durham Region Transit]] along with the other municipal transit services in [[Durham Region]].

Road transportation in Ajax is dominated by [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]], which runs east–west through the town, dividing it in half. Access to Highway 401 both east and west is available via Westney Road and Salem Road. Only four streets allow transportation from the north end of town to the south end of town by crossing over or under Highway 401. These streets are (from west to east) Church Street, Westney Road, Harwood Avenue and Salem Road. Lakeridge Road crosses the highway, but it is traditionally held to be the border between the towns of Ajax and Whitby. Notable streets that run parallel to the highway are (from north to south) Taunton Road, Rossland Road, Kingston Road (Highway 2) and Bayly Street. At Salem Road is where Highway 401 narrows to three lanes each way, causing a severe traffic bottleneck eastbound during rush hours and special holidays due to increased travel to [[Ottawa]] and [[Montreal]].

The closest international airport to Ajax is [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], located 50 kilometres to the west in [[Mississauga]].

==Education==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Ajax is served by the [[Durham District School Board]] and the [[Durham Catholic District School Board]]. There are five high schools and several elementary schools. Two of the high schools are Catholic schools: [[Notre Dame Catholic Secondary School (Ajax)|Notre Dame Catholic Secondary School]] and [[Archbishop Denis O'Connor Catholic High School]]. The other three are the public secondary schools: [[Ajax High School]], [[J. Clarke Richardson Collegiate]] and [[Pickering High School, Ajax|Pickering High School]].

== Culture ==

=== Music and dance ===

During 1955–1962, the Ajax Recreational Committee ran regular dances for the town's teenagers. The Saturday night dances, called "Ajax Teen Town", were held at the Ajax Community Centre, and were attended by as many as 500 teenagers at its peak. The Community Centre burnt down in 1960s, and the event attendance gradually declined, as music styles changed and as the members grew up.{{sfn|Archie Macdonald|1995|pp=385-386}}

For a short period beginning in the 1990s, Ajax became notable for its [[punk rock|punk]] musicians, with the ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine calling it the "punk-rock capital of Canada" in 2003. After the success of [[Sum 41]], record labels began looking for upcoming artists at the local shows in the Durham region. Several other bands and artists from Ajax achieved popularity, including [[Closet Monster (band)|Closet Monster]], [[Not by Choice]], [[Matt Brann]] and [[Jesse Colburn]] (members of [[Avril Lavigne]]'s back-up band). According to writer [[Alan Cross]], punk became popular in Ajax as the local teens kept themselves busy with music, finding not much else to do in a small town. Chameleon Café (110 Dowty Road), an [[auto body shop|auto body]] garage converted into a music venue, became a popular spot for local bands during the mid-to-late 1990s, with hundreds of teens gathering there on weekends. According to producer [[Greig Nori]], the popularity of Chameleon Café (which closed in 2001) and the proximity of Ajax to Toronto (where teens could attend major punk band concerts) helped the music scene in the town.<ref>{{cite news |author=John Intini |title=Abrasive in Ajax |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/2003/1/13/abrasive-in-ajax |date=2003-01-13 |access-date=2022-08-09 |archive-date=2022-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220810202309/https://archive.macleans.ca/article/2003/1/13/abrasive-in-ajax |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The ''[[Ajax-Pickering Rock]]'' (2003-2010) was a local [[box lacrosse]] team that played in the Ontario Lacrosse Association Senior "B" League during 2003–2010. In 2010, it was promoted to Senior "A" [[Major Series Lacrosse]] league, and played under the name ''Ajax Rock'' (2011-2012). The team faced challenges in attracting players and fan base because of competition from other teams in the Durham Region. In 2013, it moved from Ajax to the newly constructed Toronto Rock Athletic Centre (TRAC) in [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], and re-branded itself as ''Oakville Rock''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Brad Kelly |title=Ajax Rock leaving town |publisher=Oshawa This Week / DurhamRegion.com |url=https://www.durhamregion.com/community-story/3512543-ajax-rock-leaving-town/ |date=2013-03-21 |newspaper=Oshawa This Week }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Rad Joseph |title=Toronto Rock Athletic Centre (TRAC) |url=https://www.majorserieslacrosse.ca/news/toronto-rock-athletic-centre-trac |publisher=Major Series Lacrosse |date=2022-01-17 |access-date=2022-08-10 }}</ref>
