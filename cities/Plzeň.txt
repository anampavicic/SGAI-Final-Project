'''Plzeň''' ({{IPA|cs|ˈpl̩zɛɲ|-|Cs-Plzen.ogg}}), also known in English and German as '''Pilsen''' ({{IPA|de|ˈpɪlzn̩|lang|De-Pilsen.ogg}}), is a city in the [[Czech Republic]]. It is the [[Statutory city (Czech Republic)|fourth most populous city]] in the Czech Republic with about 186,000 inhabitants. It is located about {{convert|78|km|abbr=off}} west of [[Prague]], at the confluence of four rivers: [[Mže]], [[Úhlava]], [[Úslava]] and [[Radbuza]], together forming the [[Berounka]] River.

Founded as a royal city in the late 13th century, Plzeň became an important town for trade on routes linking [[Bohemia]] with [[Bavaria]]. By the 14th century it had grown to be the third largest city in Bohemia. The city was besieged three times during the 15th-century [[Hussite Wars]], when it became a centre of resistance against the Hussites. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the early 17th century the city was temporarily occupied after the [[Siege of Plzeň]]. 

In the 19th century, the city rapidly industrialised and became home to the [[Škoda Works]], which became one of the most important engineering companies in [[Austria-Hungary]] and later in [[Czechoslovakia]]. The city is known worldwide as the home of [[Pilsner]] beer, created by [[Bavaria]]n brewer [[Josef Groll]] in the city in 1842; today, the [[Pilsner Urquell Brewery]] is the largest brewery in the Czech Republic.

Plzeň serves as the main business centre of West Bohemia and the capital of the [[Plzeň Region]]. The city is a cultural heritage zone known for its [[Baroque architecture]], and was [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2015. Plzeň is home to football club [[FC Viktoria Plzeň]], one of the most successful clubs in the Czech league, and ice hockey club [[HC Škoda Plzeň]].

==History==

===Middle Ages===
The first written mention of Plzeň Castle is from 976. The city of New Plzeň was founded nearby in 1295 by King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]]. The old settlement then became known as [[Starý Plzenec]] and New Plzeň became known as Plzeň. It quickly became an important city on trade routes leading from [[Bohemia]] to [[Nuremberg]] and [[Regensburg]]. The first written mention about beer brewing is from 1307. In the 14th century, the city had about 3,000 inhabitants on an area of {{cvt|20|ha}}, making it the third largest city in Bohemia after Prague and [[Kutná Hora]].<ref name=history>{{cite web |title=Po stopách historie města|url=https://plzen.eu/o-meste/historie/po-stopach-historie/|publisher=City of Plzeň|language=cs|access-date=2024-09-25}}</ref>

During the [[Hussite Wars]], it was the centre of Catholic resistance to the [[Hussites]]: [[Prokop the Great]] unsuccessfully [[Siege of Pilsen (1433-1434)|besieged]] it three times, and it joined the league of Catholic nobles against King [[George of Poděbrady]]. In the 1470s and 1480s, the city had the first [[printing press]] in Bohemia. The first book printed here and therefore the oldest book in Bohemia is ''Statuta'' written by [[Arnošt of Pardubice]], which was printed in 1476.<ref name=history/>

===17th century===
[[File:Plzen 1602 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Engraving of Plzeň from 1602]]
Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] made Plzeň his seat from 1599 to 1600. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] the town was taken by [[Peter Ernst, Count of Mansfeld|Mansfeld]] in 1618 after the [[Siege of Plzeň]] and it was not recaptured by Imperial troops until 1621. [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|Wallenstein]] made it his winter quarters in 1633. Accused of treason and losing the support of his army, he fled the town on 23 February 1634 to [[Cheb|Eger/Cheb]] where he was assassinated two days later. The town was increasingly threatened by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]] in the last years of the war. The city commander [[Jan van der Croon]] strengthened the fortifications of Plzeň from 1645 to 1649. Swedish troops passed the town in 1645 and 1648 without attacking it. The town and region have been staunchly Catholic despite the Hussite Wars.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mikovec |first=Ferdinand Břetislav |author-link=Ferdinand Břetislav Mikovec |date=1860 |title=Malerisch-historische Skizzen aus Böhmen |language=de|volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_s92r60yIAC&pg=PA352 |publisher=Hölzel |place=Vienna/Olomouc|pages=352–355}}</ref>

From the end of the 17th century, the architecture of Plzeň has been influenced by the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. The city centre has been under [[cultural heritage preservation]] since 1989.

===19th century===
In the second half of the 19th century Plzeň, already an important trade centre for [[Bohemia]], near the Bavarian/German border, began to industrialise rapidly. In 1869 [[Emil Škoda]] founded the [[Škoda Works]], which became the most important and influential engineering company in the country and a crucial supplier of arms to the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. By 1917 the [[Škoda Works]] employed over 30,000 workers.

[[File:Wilson Bridge in Europe (4515218794).jpg|thumb|Plzeň in the interbellum]]
After 1898 the second largest employer was the National Railways train workshop, with about 2,000 employees: this was the largest rail repair shop in all [[Austria-Hungary]]. Between 1861 and 1877, the Plzeň railway junction was completed and in 1899 the first tram line started in the city. This burst of industry had two important effects: the growth of the local [[Czechs|Czech]] population and of the urban poor. After 1868 the first Czech mayor of the city was elected.

===World War II===
Following [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] independence from [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918 the ethnic German minority in the countryside bordering the city of Plzeň hoped to be united with Austria and were unhappy at being included in Czechoslovakia. Many allied themselves to the [[Nazis]] after 1933 in the hope that [[Adolf Hitler]] might be able to unite them with their German-speaking neighbours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

Following the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, Plzeň became a frontier town as the creation of the [[Sudetenland]] moved [[Nazi Germany]]'s borders closer to the city's outer limits. During the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] from 1939 to 1945, the [[Škoda Works]] in Pilsen was forced to provide armaments for the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', and Czech contributions, particularly in the field of tanks, were noted. The Nazis operated a [[Gestapo]] prison in the city,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100000353|title=Gestapogefängnis Pilsen|website=Bundesarchiv.de|language=de|access-date=2021-11-07}}</ref> and a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camp in the Karlov district.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100000331|title=Arbeitserziehungslager Pilsen-Karlow|website=Bundesarchiv.de|language=de|access-date=2021-11-07}}</ref>

Between 17 and 26 January 1942, the majority of the city's Jewish population, over 2,000 people, were deported by the Nazis to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in [[Terezín]].

[[File:Plzeň,_pomník_osvobození_U_Práce.JPG|thumb|Memorial to the [[16th Armored Division (United States)|16th Armored Division]] of the [[United States Army]] at the top of Americká, the main commercial boulevard]]
On 6 May 1945, in the final days before the [[end of World War II in Europe]], Plzeň was liberated from [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[16th Armored Division (United States)|16th Armored Division]] of General [[George Patton]]'s [[U.S. Third Army|3rd Army]]. Also participating in the liberation of the city were elements of the 97th and 2nd Infantry Divisions supported by the Polish [[Holy Cross Mountains Brigade]]. Other Third Army units liberated major portions of Western Bohemia. The rest of [[Czechoslovakia]] was liberated from German control by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Elements of the 3rd Army, as well as units from the 1st Army, remained in Plzeň until late November 1945.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

After the end of the war, the city's ethnic German minority population was [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]] and their property was confiscated in accordance to the provisions of the [[Potsdam Agreement]].

===Communist era===
After the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état]], the government launched a currency reform in 1953, which caused a wave of discontent, including the [[uprising in Plzeň (1953)|Plzeň uprising]]. On 1 June 1953, over 20,000 people, mainly workers at the Škoda Works, began protesting against the government. Protesters forced their way into the town hall and threw communist symbols, furniture and other objects out of the windows. The protest caused a retaliation from the government. As part of its retaliation, they destroyed the statue of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], the first president of Czechoslovakia. The statue has since been re-erected.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

In 1954, a [[West Germany|West German]] homing pigeon was lost near the Czechoslovak border. It returned two days later, bearing a strong anticommunist message, signed "Unbowed Pilsen." The bird, named [[Leaping Lena]], was taken to the United States, where it was celebrated as a [[Cold War]] hero.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 August 1954|title=Iron Curtain Bird Here on Crusade|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 August 1954|page=19|title=Heroine Pigeon Now a 'Citizen'}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Richard H.|title=Radio Free Europe's "Crusade for Freedom"|pages=116–117|year=2010|publisher=McFarland}}</ref>

Since the late 1990s the city has experienced high growth in foreign investment. In 2007, Israeli mall developer Plaza Centers opened the [[Pilsen Plaza]], a {{convert|20000|m2|abbr=on|sp=us}} shopping mall and entertainment centre featuring a multiplex cinema from [[Cinema City Czech Republic]].

Plzeň produces about two-thirds of the Plzeň Region GDP, even though it contains only 29.8% of its population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kr-plzensky.cz/article.asp?sec=245 |title=Krajský úřad Plzeňského kraje: Základní informace o kraji |publisher=Kr-plzensky.cz |access-date=14 April 2011}}</ref> Based on these figures, the city of Plzeň has a total GDP of approximately $7.2&nbsp;billion, and a per capita GDP of $44,000. While part of this is explained by commuters to the city, it is one of the most prosperous cities in the Czech Republic.

The [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] company, established in Plzeň in 1859, has been an important element of Austro-Hungarian, Czechoslovak and Czech engineering, and one of the biggest European arms factories. During the Communist era (1948–1989) the company's production had been directed to the needs of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Disarray in the era after the [[Velvet Revolution]], and unsuccessful efforts to gain new Western markets, resulted in sales problems and debts. After a huge restructuring process, the company was divided into several subsidiaries, which were later sold. The most important successors companies are [[Škoda Transportation]] and [[Doosan Škoda Power]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.doosan.com/en/intro/business-highlight/|title=Business Highlight|website=www.doosan.com|accessdate=11 October 2023}}</ref>

Many foreign companies now have manufacturing bases in Plzeň, including [[Daikin]], [[Hisense]] and [[Panasonic]]. The software provider company [[ZF Openmatics]] was founded and is headquartered in this city. There has been much discussion of redeveloping those large areas of the Škoda plant which the company no longer uses.

[[Fernet Stock|Stock]], located in the Božkov district, is the biggest distillery in the Czech Republic.

The [[Plzeň agglomeration]] was defined as a tool for drawing money from the [[European Structural and Investment Funds]]. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 328,000 inhabitants.

Plzeň is well known for the [[Pilsner Urquell]] (since 1842) and [[Gambrinus (beer)|Gambrinus]] (since 1869) [[brewery|breweries]], currently owned by Asahi Group Holdings.

Plzeň is an important city in the history of beer, including the development of [[Pilsner]].<ref name="Hampson9">{{cite book |last=Hampson |first=Tim |url=https://archive.org/details/beerbook0000unse_y0h6/page/9/mode/2up |title=The Beer Book |date=2008 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |isbn=978-1405333016 |location=London |page=9 |url-access=registration}}</ref> In 1375, Bohemian King [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] endowed the Dobrow Monastery near Plzeň with the beer right, and it is one of the oldest breweries to survive to modern times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/beeritshistoryit00sale|title=Beer : its history and its economic value as a national beverage|first=F.

The officials of Plzeň founded a city-owned brewery in 1839, {{lang|de|Bürger Brauerei}} (Citizens' Brewery, now [[Plzeňský Prazdroj]]),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prazdroj.cz/en/about-the-company/history |title=Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s. |publisher=prazdroj.cz |access-date=17 October 2009 }}</ref> and recruited Bavarian brewer [[Josef Groll]] (1813–1887) who produced the first batch of modern Pilsner beer on 5 October 1842. This included mastering the art of triple [[Mashing#Decoction mashing|decoction mashing]].<ref name="Hampson9"/> The combination of pale colour from the new malts, Plzeň's remarkably soft water, [[Saaz hops|Saaz]] [[noble hops]] from nearby [[Žatec]] (''Saaz'' in German) and Bavarian-style [[lager]]ing<!-- ice-cooled --> produced a clear, golden beer which was regarded as a sensation. Improving transport meant that this new beer was soon available throughout Central Europe and {{lang|de|Pilsner Brauart}}-style brewing was widely imitated.

In 1859, "Pilsner Bier" was registered as a brand name at the Chamber of Commerce and Trade in Plzeň. In 1898, the [[Pilsner Urquell]] trade mark was created to put emphasis on this being the brewery where the style originated.
