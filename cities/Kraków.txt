===Early modern period===
The 15th and 16th centuries were known as Poland's {{lang|pl|Złoty Wiek}} or [[Golden age (metaphor)|Golden Age]].<ref name="NormanDavies"/> Many works of [[Polish Renaissance]] art and architecture were created,<ref name="Mikos"/><ref name="unescoancient"/> including ancient synagogues in Kraków's Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz, such as the [[Old Synagogue (Kraków)|Old Synagogue]].<ref name="infosyn"/> During the reign of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]], various artists came to work and live in Kraków, and [[Johann Haller]] established a [[printing press]] in the city<ref name="Haller"/> after [[Kasper Straube]] had printed the [[Calendarium Cracoviense]], the first work printed in Poland, in 1473.<ref name="Norman Davies, God's Playground, vol.1, chapter 5"/><ref name="Wieslaw Wydra 88"/>

In 1520, the most famous [[church bell]] in Poland, named {{lang|pl|[[The Sigismund Bell|Zygmunt]]}} after [[Sigismund I of Poland]], was cast by Hans Behem.<ref name="dzwon"/> At that time, [[Hans Dürer]], a younger brother of artist and thinker [[Albrecht Dürer]], was Sigismund's [[court painter]].<ref name="HansDur"/> [[Hans von Kulmbach]] made [[altarpiece]]s for several churches.<ref name="Kulmbach"/> In 1553, the Kazimierz district council gave the Jewish [[Qahal]] (council of a Jewish self-governing community) a licence for the right to build their own interior walls across the western section of the already existing defensive walls. The walls were expanded again in 1608 due to the growth of the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia.<ref name="Kazimierz.com"/> In 1572, King [[Sigismund II]], the last of the Jagiellons, died childless. The Polish throne passed to [[Henry III of France]] and then to other foreign-based rulers in rapid succession, causing a decline in the city's importance. Furthermore, in 1596, [[Sigismund III]] of the [[House of Vasa]] moved the administrative capital of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from Kraków to [[Warsaw]].<ref name="warsaw-capital-1596"/> The city was destabilised by pillaging in the 1650s during the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion]], especially during the [[Siege of Kraków|1655 siege]].<ref name="Milewski2">{{cite web |first=Dariusz |last=Milewski |date=8 June 2007 |title=Szwedzi w Krakowie |url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kiosk/historia/szwedzi-w-krakowie,1,3338904,wiadomosc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518220019/http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kiosk/historia/szwedzi-w-krakowie,1,3338904,wiadomosc.html |archive-date=18 May 2011 |access-date=10 April 2015 |work=Internet Archive |publisher=[[Mówią Wieki]] |language=pl}}</ref> Later in 1707, the city underwent an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] that left 20,000 of the city's residents dead.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Frandsen |first=Karl-Erik |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3bNWrVRMb8C |title=The Last Plague in the Baltic Region 1709-1713 |date=2010 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |isbn=978-87-635-0770-7 |pages=20 |language=en}}</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:Smuglewicz Kosciuszko 2.jpg|thumb|[[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] taking the [[Kościuszko's proclamation|oath of loyalty to the Polish nation]] in Kraków's market square (''Rynek''), 1794]]

Already weakened during the 18th century, by the mid-1790s the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] had twice been [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by its neighbors: [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[Habsburg empire]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].<ref name="The Polish struggle for freedom"/> In 1791, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] changed the status of Kazimierz as a separate city and made it into a district of Kraków. The richer Jewish families began to move out. However, because of the injunction against travel on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues. In 1794, [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] initiated an unsuccessful [[Kościuszko Uprising|insurrection]] in [[Main Square, Kraków|the town's Main Square]] which, in spite of his victorious [[Battle of Racławice]] against a numerically superior [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]], resulted in the [[Third Partition of Poland|third and final partition of Poland]]. As a result, Kraków fell under Habsburg rule.<ref name="GR"/>

In 1802, German became the town's official language. Of the members appointed by the Habsburgs to the municipal council only half were Polish.<ref name=Franaszek>{{Cite web |last=Franaszek |first=Piotr |title=Economic effects of Cracow's frontier between 1772 and 1867 |url=https://shron2.chtyvo.org.ua/Zbirnyk_statei/Die_galizische_Grenze_1772-1867_Kommunikation_oder_Isolation7_nim.pdf |access-date=31 March 2023 |archive-date=31 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531114948/https://shron2.chtyvo.org.ua/Zbirnyk_statei/Die_galizische_Grenze_1772-1867_Kommunikation_oder_Isolation7_nim.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> From 1796 to 1809, the population of the city rose from 22,000 to 26,000 with an increasing percentage of nobles and officials.<ref name=Franaszek/> In 1809, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] captured former Polish territories from Austria and made the town part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].<ref name=Franaszek/> During the time of the Duchy of Warsaw, requirements to upkeep the Polish army followed by tours of Austrian, Polish and Russian troops, plus Russian occupation and a flood in the year 1813 all added up to the adverse development of the city with a high debt burden on public finances and many workshops and trading houses needing to close their activities.<ref name=Franaszek/>

[[File:Józef Brodowski 001.JPG|thumb|Act of granting the constitution to the [[Free City of Cracow]]. After the [[Partitions of Poland]], Kraków became a city-state and remained the only piece of sovereign Polish territory between 1815 and 1846.]]

Following Napoleon's defeat, the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the pre-war boundaries but also created the partially independent and neutral [[Free City of Kraków]].<ref name=Franaszek/> In addition to the historic city of Kraków itself, the Free City included the towns of [[Chrzanow]], [[Trzebinia]] and [[Nowa Góra, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Nowa Gora]] and 224 villages. Outside the city, mining and metallurgy started developing. The population of Kraków itself grew in this time from 23,000 to 43,000; that of the overall republic from 88,000 to 103,000. The population of the city had an increasing number of [[Catholic]] clergy, officials and intelligentsia with which the rich townspeople sympathised. They were opposed to the conservative [[landed aristocracy]] who also were drawn more and more to the city real estates even though their income still mainly came from their agricultural possessions in the Republic, the Kingdom of Poland and Galicia. The percentage of the Jewish population in the city also increased in this time from 20.8% to 30.4%. However, nationalist sentiment and other political issues led to instability; this culminated in the [[Kraków uprising]] of 1846, which was crushed by the Austrian authorities.<ref name="Frommer"/> The Free City was therefore annexed into the Austrian Empire as the [[Grand Duchy of Kraków]] ({{langx|pl|Wielkie Księstwo Krakowskie}}, {{langx|de|Großherzogtum Krakau}}), which was legally separate from but administratively part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] (more simply Austrian Galicia).<ref name="Chambers's encyclopaedia: a... - Google Books"/>

During the era of the free city, a [[free trade zone]] led to positive economic development. But because of the unstable political situation and insecurity about the future, not much of the accumulated wealth was invested.<ref name=Franaszek/> Through the increase of taxes, customs and regulations, prices soared and the city fell into a recession. From 1844 to 1850 the population was diminished by over 4,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Franaszek/>

In 1866, Austria granted a degree of autonomy to Galicia after its own defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]].<ref name="(''see: Franz Joseph I granted Kraków the municipal government'')"/> Kraków, being politically freer than the Polish cities under Prussian (later German) and Russian rule, became a Polish national symbol and a centre of culture and art, known frequently as the "Polish Athens" ({{lang|pl|Polskie Ateny}}). Many leading Polish artists of the period resided in Kraków,<ref name="google"/> among them the seminal painter [[Jan Matejko]],<ref name="Matejko"/> laid to rest at [[Rakowicki Cemetery]], and the founder of modern Polish drama, [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].<ref name="culture"/> [[Fin de siècle]] Kraków evolved into a modern metropolis; [[Tap water|running water]] and electric [[streetcars]] were introduced in 1901, and between 1910 and 1915, Kraków and its surrounding suburban communities were gradually combined into a single administrative unit called Greater Kraków ({{lang|pl|Wielki Kraków}}).<ref name="Becoming Metropolitan: Urban Selfhood and the Making of Modern Krakow"/><ref name="Kalendarium"/>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] on 3 August 1914, [[Józef Piłsudski]] formed a small [[cadre (military)|cadre]] [[military organization|military unit]], the [[First Cadre Company]]—the predecessor of the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]—which set out from Kraków to fight for the liberation of Poland.<ref name="Urb 171-172"/> The city was briefly besieged by Russian troops in November 1914.<ref name="twierdza"/> Austrian rule in Kraków ended in 1918 when the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] assumed power.<ref name="Eastern Europe: an introduction to... - Google Books"/><ref name="Encyclopedia of Rusyn history and... - Google Books"/>

Following the emergence of the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1918, Kraków resumed its role as a major Polish academic and cultural centre, with the establishment of new universities such as the [[AGH University of Science and Technology]] and the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]], as well as several new and essential vocational schools.

Following the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in September 1939, the city of Kraków became part of the [[General Government]], a separate administrative region of the Third Reich. On 26&nbsp;October 1939, the Nazi régime set up {{lang|de|[[Distrikt Krakau]]}}, one of four districts within the General Government. On the same day, the city of Kraków became the capital of the administration.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 February 2021 |title=Niemiecka okupacja w Krakowie na zdjęciach |url=https://krowoderska.pl/niemiecka-okupacja-w-krakowie-na-zdjeciach/ |access-date=24 April 2022 |website=Krowoderska.pl |language=pl-PL |archive-date=6 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230206065228/https://krowoderska.pl/niemiecka-okupacja-w-krakowie-na-zdjeciach/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The General Government was ruled by Governor-General [[Hans Frank]], who was based in the city's Wawel Castle.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], some 56,000 Jews resided in Kraków—almost one-quarter of a total population of about 250,000; by November 1939, the Jewish population of the city had grown to approximately 70,000.<ref name=USHMM-Holocaust-Encyclopedia-Krakow/><ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/> According to German statistics from 1940, over 200,000 Jews lived within the entire Kraków District, comprising more than 5&nbsp;percent of the district's total population. However, these statistics probably underestimate the situation.<ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/> In November 1939, during an operation known as {{lang|de|[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]}} ('special operation Kraków'), the Germans arrested more than 180 university professors and academics, and sent them to the [[Sachsenhausen]] and [[Dachau]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], though the survivors were later released on the request of prominent Italians.<ref name="16B.

[[File:Krakow-Ghetto-checkpoint.jpg|thumb|[[Kraków Ghetto]], 1942—a German checkpoint during {{lang|de|[[Aktion Krakau]]}}]]

Before the formation of [[ghettos]], which began in the Kraków District in December 1939, Jews were encouraged to flee the city. For those who remained, the German authorities decided in March 1941 to allocate a then-suburban neighborhood, [[Podgórze|Podgórze District]], to become Kraków's ghetto, where many Jews subsequently died of illness or starvation. Initially, most ghettos were open and Jews were allowed to enter and exit freely, but as security became tighter the ghettos were generally closed. From autumn 1941, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] developed the policy of [[extermination through labour]],{{sfn|Longerich|2010| p=171}} which further worsened the already bleak conditions for Jews. The inhabitants of the [[Kraków Ghetto]] were later murdered or sent to German [[extermination camp]]s, including [[Belzec extermination camp|Bełżec]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and to [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp]].<ref name="The-Kraków_Ghetto_1940-1943"/> The largest deportations within the Distrikt occurred from June to September 1942. More specifically, mass deportation from Kraków's ghetto occurred in the first week of June 1942,<ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/> and the ghetto was finally liquidated in March 1943.{{sfn|Longerich|2010| p=376}}

The film director [[Roman Polanski]] survived the Kraków Ghetto. [[Oskar Schindler]] selected employees from the ghetto to work in his enamelware factory {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik]]}}, saving them from the camps.<ref name="All for Love - Google Books"/><ref name="Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account... - Google Books"/> Similarly, many men capable of physical labor were saved from deportation to extermination camps and instead sent to labor camps across the General Government.<ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/> By September 1943, the last of the Jews from the Kraków Ghetto had been deported. Although [[Looting of Poland in World War II|looted by occupational authorities]], Kraków remained relatively undamaged at the end of World War II,<ref name="LukZaw"/> with most of the city's historical and architectural legacy spared. Soviet forces under the command of Marshal [[Ivan Konev]] entered the city on 18&nbsp;January 1945, and began arresting Poles loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] or those who had served in the Home Army.<ref>Gilbert, M (1989) Second World War, Weidenfeld & Nicolson P646.</ref>

After the war, under the [[Polish People's Republic]] (officially declared in 1952), the intellectual and academic community of Kraków came under complete political control.

Kraków's historic centre, which includes [[Kraków Old Town|the Old Town]] (''Stare Miasto''), the [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Market Square]] (''Rynek Główny''), the [[Kraków Cloth Hall|Cloth Hall]] (''Sukiennice''), the [[Barbican]] (''Barbakan''), [[St. Florian's Gate]], [[Kazimierz]] and the [[Wawel Castle]], was included as the first of its kind on the list of [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in 1978.<ref name="Centre"/> The central core surrounded by [[Planty Park]] remains the most prominent example of an old town in the country, with the medieval street layout still in existence.<ref name="Gustafson"/> Kraków was the royal capital of Poland for many centuries, until [[Sigismund III Vasa]] relocated the court to [[Warsaw]] in 1596.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Thomas M. |date=2023 |title=Europe.

Several important monuments were lost in the course of history, notably the [[Kraków Town Hall|Ratusz town hall]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Co się stało z krakowskim ratuszem? |url=https://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2012/01/19/co-sie-stalo-z-krakowskim-ratuszem/ |access-date=28 January 2023 |website=CiekawostkiHistoryczne.pl |date=19 January 2012 |language=pl-PL |archive-date=28 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230128083114/https://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2012/01/19/co-sie-stalo-z-krakowskim-ratuszem/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the Gothic [[Town Hall Tower, Kraków|Town Hall Tower]] measuring {{height|m=70}} in height remains standing.<ref name="Nungovitch1"/>

In addition to the old town, the city's district of [[Kazimierz]] is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, as well as the historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (''Pons Regalis'') across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Kraków to the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.<ref name="Świszczowski"/><ref name="wandaluzja-1"/>

By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially [[Synagogues of Kraków|registered synagogues]] and prayer houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like [[Podgórze]].<ref name="krakow.jewish.org.pl-pdf"/> This, in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz and the development of new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings, however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.<ref>{{Cite web |date=12 July 2024 |title=KAZIMIERZ: THINGS TO DO & SEE IN KRAKOW'S JEWISH QUARTER |url=https://krakowmonamour.com/kazimierz-krakow-jewish-quarter/ |access-date=12 July 2024 |website=Krakow Mon Amour}}</ref>

As the city of Kraków began to expand further under the rule of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the new architectural styles also developed. Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Kraków include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of [[Kraków Główny railway station]] and the city's [[Kraków University of Economics|Academy of Economics]]. It was also at around that time that Kraków's first radial boulevards began to appear, with the city undergoing a large-scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. New representative government buildings and multi-story tenement houses were built at around that time. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in [[Vienna]]. Some major projects of the era include the development of the [[Jagiellonian University]]'s new premises and the building of the [[Collegium Novum]] just west of the Old Town. The imperial style planning of the city's further development continued until the return of Poland's independence, following the First World War. Early modernist style in Kraków is represented by such masterpieces as [[Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts|the Palace of Art]] by [[Franciszek Mączyński]] and the 'House under the Globe'. [[Vienna Secession#Architecture|Secession style]] architecture, which had arrived in Kraków from [[Vienna]], became popular towards the end of [[Partitions of Poland|the Partitions]].<ref name="Strasz"/>

[[File:DZolopa 033 2013.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts|Palace of Art]] at Szczepański Square is an example of [[Art Nouveau]] architecture in central Kraków.<ref name="Palace of Art"/>]]

With Poland's regained independence came the major change in the fortunes of Kraków—now the second most important city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style.<ref name="Vogt-Nassery"/> Important buildings constructed in the style of [[Polish modernism]] include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the [[Main Square, Kraków|Main Square]] and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.<ref name="Kraków, Oleandry – Dom im. Józefa Piłsudskiego"/>

After the Second World War, new Communist government adopted [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist monumentalism]]. The doctrine of [[Socialist realism in Poland]], as in other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]], was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists.<ref name="inyourpocket/sightseeing">{{cite web|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/krakow/sightseeing/Nowa-Huta|title=Nowa Huta – Sightseeing in Kraków – In Your Pocket city guide – essential travel guides to cities in Poland|publisher=Inyourpocket.com|access-date=11 December 2011|archive-date=8 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208081319/http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/krakow/sightseeing/Nowa-Huta|url-status=live}}</ref> The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.<ref name="Nh.pl-1"/>

[[File:Nowa Huta - Plac Centralny z lotu ptaka.jpg|thumb|Plac Centralny, the main square of the socialist-realist district [[Nowa Huta]]]]

Since the style of the [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland's [[Socialist realism in Poland|Socialist national]] format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism]].<ref name="SOCREALIZM in Poland (1949–1955)"/> The [[socrealism|soc-realist]] centre of Nowa Huta is considered to be a meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large [[Plattenbau|Panel System]] apartment blocks, most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the latter half of the 20th century in Kraków.<ref name="naszemiasto-cracovia"/>

After the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the birth of the [[Third Polish Republic|Third Republic]] in the latter half of the 20th century,<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 June 2022 |title=Kraków z lotu ptaka.

As a result, the Office of Public Information was created to handle inquiries and foster communication between city departments and citizens at large.<ref name="Institutional Capital: Building Post-communist Government Performance"/>

In 2000, the city government introduced a new long-term program called "Safer City" in cooperation with the Police, Traffic, Social Services, Fire, [[Public Safety]], and the Youth Departments. Subsequently, the number of criminal offences dropped by 3 percent between 2000 and 2001, and the rate of detection increased by 1.4 percent to a total of 30.2 percent in the same period.<ref name="krakow"/> The city is receiving help in carrying out the program from all educational institutions and the local media, including TV, radio and the press.

===Districts===
{{Main|Districts of Kraków}}
Kraków is divided into 18 administrative districts (''[[dzielnica]]'') or boroughs, each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government.<ref name="districts"/> Prior to March 1991, the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a sense of identity to Kraków: the towns of [[Podgórze]], [[Nowa Huta]] and [[Krowodrza]], which were amalgamated into the city as it expanded; and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself.<ref name="districts"/>
[[File:Kanonicza street, view from S, Old Town, Kraków, Poland.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kanonicza Street, Kraków|Kanonicza Street]] in the Old Town (''[[Kraków Old Town|Stare Miasto]]'') district]]
The oldest neighborhoods of Kraków were incorporated into the city before the late 18th century. These include the Old Town (''[[Kraków Old Town|Stare Miasto]]''), once contained within the [[Florian Gate|city defensive walls]] and now encircled by the Planty park; the [[Wawel]] District, which is the site of the Royal Castle and the cathedral; Stradom and [[Kazimierz]] with its historic Jewish quarter, the latter originally divided into Christian and Jewish quarters;<ref name="Krakow, Auschwitz and Warsaw"/> and the ancient town of [[Kleparz]].

Major districts added in the 19th and 20th centuries include [[Podgórze]]—until 1915, a separate town on the southern bank of the Vistula—and Nowa Huta, to the east of the city centre, which was built after World War II.

Among the most notable historic districts of the city are: Wawel Hill, home to [[Wawel Castle]] and [[Wawel Cathedral]], where many historic Polish kings are buried; the medieval Old Town, with its {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=mid|-square}} [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Market Square]]; dozens of old churches and museums; the 14th-century buildings of the Jagiellonian University; and Kazimierz, the historical centre of Kraków's Jewish social and religious life.<ref name="Krakow"/>

[[File:Kościół św. Józefa Kraków.jpg|left|thumb|Rynek Podgórski - main square of [[Podgórze]] district with [[St. Joseph's Church, Podgórze|St. Joseph's Church]]]]

The Old Town district of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art.<ref name="architecture72"/> Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Romanesque (e.g. [[St. Andrew's Church, Kraków|St. Andrew's Church]]), Renaissance (e.g. [[Kraków Cloth Hall]]), Baroque (e.g. [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków|Saints Peter and Paul Church]]) and Gothic buildings. Kraków's palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display a great variety of color, architectural details, [[stained glass]], paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kraków (Poland) {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Krakow/images-videos |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

In the Market Square stands the Gothic [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]] (''Kościół Mariacki''). Rebuilt in the 14th century, it features the famous wooden altar ([[Altarpiece of Veit Stoss]]), the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world,<ref name="Kurtz"/> carved by [[Veit Stoss]]. A trumpet call (''[[hejnał mariacki]]'') is sounded every hour from the church's main tower. The melody, which used to announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly in midstream. According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century [[Tatar]] invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. Whilst playing, he was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces and the bugle call broke off at the moment he died.<ref name="hejnal"/> The story is recounted in [[Eric P. Kelly]]{{'s}} 1928 book ''[[The Trumpeter of Krakow]]'', which won a [[Newbery Award]].<ref name="JPKelly"/>

Kraków was an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life before the outbreak of World War II, with all its manifestations of religious observance from [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] to [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] flourishing side by side. There were at least 90 synagogues in Kraków active before the [[Nazi German]] invasion of Poland, serving its burgeoning Jewish community of 60,000–80,000 (out of the city's total population of 237,000), established since the early 12th century.<ref name="Dylewski"/>

Most synagogues of Kraków were ruined during World War II by the [[Nazis]] who despoiled them of all ceremonial objects, and used them as storehouses for ammunition, firefighting equipment, as general storage facilities and stables. The post-[[Holocaust]] Jewish population of the city had dwindled to about 5,900 before the end of the 1940s. Poland was the only [[Eastern Bloc]] country to allow free Jewish [[aliyah]] (emigration to Israel) without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II.<ref name=D-H>Devorah Hakohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCw6v0TFhdMC&dq=%22Poland+opened+its+gates+to+Jewish+emigration.%22&pg=PA70 ''Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and Its Repercussions...''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404185009/https://books.google.com/books?id=hCw6v0TFhdMC&dq=%22Poland+opened+its+gates+to+Jewish+emigration.%22&pg=PA70 |date=4 April 2023 }} Syracuse University Press, 2003 – 325 pages.
