'''Cap-Haïtien''' ({{IPA|fr|kap a.isjɛ̃|lang}}; {{langx|ht|Kap Ayisyen}}; "Haitian Cape"), typically spelled '''Cape Haitien''' in English and often locally referred to as {{lang|fr|'''Le Cap'''}}, {{lang|ht|'''Okap'''|link=no}} or {{lang|fr|'''Au Cap'''|link=no}}, is a [[List of communes of Haiti|commune]] of about 274,000 people on the north coast of [[Haiti]] and capital of the [[Departments of Haiti|department]] of [[Nord (Haitian department)|Nord]].

After the Haitian Revolution, it became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Haiti]] under King Henri I until 1820.

Cap-Haïtien's long history of independent thought was formed in part by its relative distance from Port-au-Prince, the barrier of mountains between it and the southern part of the country, and a history of large African populations. These contributed to making it a legendary incubator of independent movements since slavery times. For instance, from February 5–29, 2004, the city was taken over by militants who opposed the rule of the Haïtian president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. They eventually created enough political pressure to force him out of office and the country.

Cap-Haïtien is near the historic Haitian town of [[Milot, Haiti|Milot]], which lies {{convert|12|mi|km|order=flip}} to the southwest along a gravel road. Milot was Haiti's first capital under the self-proclaimed King [[Henri Christophe]], who ascended to power in 1807, three years after Haiti had gained independence from France. He renamed Cap‑Français as Cap‑Henri. Milot is the site of his [[Sans-Souci Palace]], wrecked by the 1842 earthquake. The [[Citadelle Laferrière]], a massive stone fortress bristling with cannons, atop a nearby mountain is {{convert|5|mi|km|0|order=flip|spell=in}} away. On clear days, its silhouette is visible from Cap‑Haïtien.

The small [[Cap-Haïtien International Airport]], located on the southeast edge of the city, is served by several small domestic airlines. It was patrolled by [[Chile]]an [[UN]] troops from the "O'Higgins Base" after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]. Several hundred UN personnel, including nearby units from [[Nepal]] and [[Uruguay]], are assigned to the city during the 2010-2017 United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ([[MINUSTAH]]). The airport was the only functioning international airport in the country after the closure of the [[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]] in [[Tabarre]] due to gang violence in March 2024. Significant migration from the capital occurred during the [[Haitian crisis (2018–present)|Haitian crisis]], putting strain on infrastructure and on the educational system.<ref name="capital okap">{{Cite news |newspaper=Independent |title=Haiti's former capital seeks to revive its hey-day as gang violence consumes Port-au-Prince |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/portauprince-ap-haiti-john-french-b2531812.html |last=Coto |first=Dnica |date=2024-04-20 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Cathedral of Cap-Haitien.jpg|thumb|The well-preserved Cathedral Notre-Dame of Cap‑Haïtien]]

The island was occupied for thousands of years by cultures of [[indigenous peoples]], who had migrated from present-day Central and South America. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers in the Caribbean began to colonize [[Hispaniola]]. They adopted the native [[Taíno]] name ''Guárico'' for the area that is today known as "Cap‑Haïtien".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbgCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA152 |title=Notes on Haiti: Made During a Residence in that Republic |volume=1 |last=Mackenzie |first=Charles |page=152 |year=1830}}</ref> Due to the introduction of new infectious diseases, as well as poor treatment, the indigenous peoples population rapidly declined.

On the nearby coast [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] founded his first community in the New World, the short-lived [[La Navidad]]. In 1975, researchers found near Cap‑Haïtien another of the first Spanish towns of Hispaniola: [[Puerto Real (Haiti)|Puerto Real]] was founded in 1503. It was abandoned in 1578, and its ruins were not discovered until late in the twentieth century.<ref>Florida Museum of Natural History, [http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/histarch/puertoReal.htm Puerto Real].</ref>

In 1670 during the French colonial period, Cap-Haïtien, or Cap-Français as the settlement was then known, was founded by a dozen colonists-adventurers under the command of [[Bertrand d'Ogeron]].

[[File:Caphaitien bike.jpg|thumb|A street scene in Cap‑Haïtien]]
The French occupied roughly a third of the island of Hispaniola from the Spanish in the early eighteenth century. They established large [[sugar cane]] [[plantations]] on the northern plains and imported tens of thousands of African slaves to work them. Cap‑Français became an important port city of the French colonial period and the colony's main commercial centre.<ref name="Knight1991"/> It served as the capital of the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] from the city's formal founding in 1711 until 1770, when the capital was moved to [[Port-au-Prince]] on the west coast of the island. After the slave revolution, this was the first capital of the Kingdom of Haiti under King Henri I, when the nation was split apart.

The central area of the city is between the Bay of Cap‑Haïtien to the east and nearby mountainsides, as well as the [[Acul Bay]], to the west; these are increasingly dominated by flimsy urban slums. The streets are generally narrow and arranged in grids. As a legacy of the United States' occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934, Cap‑Haïtien's north–south streets were renamed as single letters (beginning with Rue A, a major avenue) and going to "Q", and its east–west streets with numbers from 1 to 26; the system is not followed outside the central city, where French names predominate. The historic city has numerous markets, churches, and low-rise apartment buildings (of three–four storeys), constructed primarily before and during the U.S. occupation. Much of the infrastructure is in need of repair. Many such buildings have balconies on the upper floors, which overlook the narrow streets below. With people eating outside on the balconies, there is an intimate communal atmosphere during dinner hours.

==Economy==
[[File:Street view in Cap Haitien, Haiti.jpg|thumb|left|French colonial architecture in Cap]]

Cap-Haïtien is known as the nation's largest center of historic monuments and as such, it is a tourist destination. The bay, beaches and monuments have made it a resort and vacation destination for Haiti's upper classes, comparable to [[Pétion-Ville]]. Cap‑Haïtien has also attracted more international tourists at times, as it has been isolated from the political instability in the south of the island.

It has a wealth of French colonial architecture, which has been well preserved. During and after the [[Haitian Revolution]], many craftsmen from Cap‑Haïtien, who were [[free people of color]], fled to French-controlled [[New Orleans]] as they were under attack by the mostly African slaves. As a result, the two cities share many similarities in styles of architecture. Especially notable are the [[gingerbread house (architecture)|gingerbread house]]s lining the city's older streets.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

Since 2021, there have been significant electrical outages in Cap Haïtien, due in large part to a lack of fuel. Those who can afford it have invested in solar energy.<ref>{{cite news |last=peralta |first=Eyder |work=NPR |date=2024-04-18 |title=A portrait of Haitians trying to survive without a government |url=https://www.npr.org/2024/04/18/1245048299/haiti-haitians-cap-haitien }}</ref><ref name="6monthsinDark">{{cite news| newspaper=Ayibo Post | author=Jameson Francisque |date=2022-06-09 |title=La ville du Cap-Haitien plongée dans le noir depuis six mois |url=https://ayibopost.com/la-ville-du-cap-haitien-plongee-dans-le-noir-depuis-six-mois/ }}</ref> A power plant built in [[Caracol, Haiti#Construction|Caracol]] to provide electricity to the Industrial Park reaches as far as [[Limonade]] 30 minutes from downtown Cap Haïtien.<ref name="6monthsinDark" />

==Tourism==
===Labadie and other beaches===
[[File:Labadee, Haiti Aug 2002.JPG|thumb|left|Labadie beach and village]]

The walled [[Labadee|Labadie]] (or Labadee) beach resort compound is located {{convert|6|mi|km|0|order=flip|spell=in}} to the city's northwest. It serves as a brief stopover for [[Royal Caribbean International]] (RCI) cruise ships. Major RCI cruise ships dock weekly at Labadie. It is a private resort leased by RCI, which has generated the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986. It employs 300 locals, allows another 200 to sell their wares on the premises, and pays the Haitian government US$6 per tourist.

The resort is connected to Cap‑Haïtien by a mountainous, recently paved road. RCI has built a pier at Labadie, completed in late 2009, capable of servicing the luxury-class large ships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expedia.com/daily/cruise/geo/ports.asp?tiid=6024010 |title=Labadie |publisher=Expedia.com |access-date=2007-08-02 }}</ref>

Attractions include a Haitian market, numerous beaches, watersports, a water-oriented playground, and a [[zip-line]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011900555.html |title=Labadie |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=2007-08-02 |date=2007-01-21 }}</ref>

===Vertières===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2024}}

Vertières is the site of the [[Battle of Vertières]], the last and defining battle of the [[Haitian Revolution]]. On November 18, 1803, the Haitian army led by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] defeated a French colonial army led by the [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]]. The French withdrew their remaining 7,000 troops (many had died from yellow fever and other diseases), and in 1804, Dessalines' revolutionary government declared the independence of Haiti. The revolution had been underway, with some pauses, since the 1790s.
In this last battle for independence, rebel leader Capois La Mort survived all the French bullets that nearly killed him. His horse was killed under him, and his hat fell off, but he kept advancing on the French, yelling, "En avant!" (Go forward!) to his men. He has become renowned as a hero of the revolution. The 18 of November has been widely celebrated since then as a Day of Army and Victory in Haiti.

[[File:Sans Souci Palace Ruins.jpg|thumb|Inside the ruins of [[Sans Souci Palace]]]]

===Citadelle Henry and Sans-Souci Palace===
The [[Citadelle Laferrière]], also known as Citadelle Henry, or the Citadelle, is a large mountaintop [[fortress]] located approximately {{convert|17|mi|km|order=flip}} south of the city of Cap‑Haïtien and {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip|0|spell=in}} beyond the town of [[Milot, Haiti|Milot]]. It is the largest fortress in the Americas, and was listed by UNESCO as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1982 along with the nearby [[Sans-Souci Palace]]. The Citadel was built by [[Henry Christophe]], a leader during the Haitian slave rebellion and self-declared King of Northern Haiti, after the country gained its independence from France in 1804. Together with the remains of his [[Sans-Souci Palace]], damaged in the 1842 earthquake, Citadelle Henry has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/180 "Citadelle Henry"], UNESCO World Heritage Sites</ref>

===Bois Caïman===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2024}}
{{Further|Bois Caïman}}

[[Bois Caïman]] ({{langx|ht|Bwa Kayiman}}), {{convert|3|km|mi|0|spell=in}} south of road RN 1, is the place where [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] rites were performed under a tree at the beginning of the slave revolution. For decades, [[Maroon (people)|maroons]] had been terrorizing slaveholders on the northern plains by poisoning their food and water. Makandal is the legendary (and perhaps historical) figure associated with the growing resistance movement. By the 1750s, he had organized the maroons, as well as many people enslaved on plantations, into a secret army. Makandal was murdered (or disappeared) in 1758, but the resistance movement grew.

At Bois Caïman, a maroon leader named [[Dutty Boukman]] held the first mass antislavery meeting secretly on August 14, 1791. At this meeting, a Vodou ceremony was performed, and all those present swore to die rather than to endure the continuation of slavery on the island. Following the ritual led by Boukman and a [[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]] named [[Cécile Fatiman]], the insurrection started on the night of August 22–23, 1791. Boukman was killed in an ambush soon after the revolution began. Jean-François was the next leader to follow Dutty Boukman in the uprising of the slaves, the Haitian equivalent of the [[storming of the Bastille]] in the French Revolution. Slaves burned the plantations and cane fields, and massacred French colonists across the northern plains. They also attacked Cap-Français and some of the free people of color. Eventually the revolution gained  the independence of Haiti from France and freedom for the slaves. The site of Dutty Boukman's ceremony is marked by a [[ficus]] tree. Adjoining it is a colonial well, which is credited with mystic powers.

===Morne Rouge===
Morne Rouge is {{convert|8|km|mi|0|spell=in}} to the south of Cap. It is the site of the sugar plantation known as "Habitation Le Normand de Mezy", known for several slaves who led the rebellion against the French.<ref name="Cameron, p. 409">Cameron, p. 409</ref>

==Disasters==
===1842 Cap-Haïtien earthquake===
{{Main|1842 Cap-Haïtien earthquake}}

On 7 May 1842, an [[list of earthquakes in Haiti|earthquake]] destroyed most of the city and other towns in the north of Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic. Among the buildings destroyed or significantly damaged was the [[Sans-Souci Palace]]. Ten thousand people were killed in the [[earthquake]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Prepetit |first=Claude |title=Tremblements de terre en Haïti, mythe ou réalité ? |date=9 October 2008 |url=http://www.bme.gouv.ht/risques%20geologiques/LeMatin_s%E9ismes.pdf |work=Le Matin |volume=33082}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, quoting {{Citation |last=Moreau de Saint-Méry |first=Médéric Louis Élie |title=Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie française de l'Ile Saint Domingue |author-link=Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry}} and {{Citation |author=J.

===2010 Haiti earthquake===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2024}}
{{Main|2010 Haiti earthquake}}

In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which destroyed port facilities in Port-au-Prince, the [[Port international du Cap-Haïtien]] was used to deliver relief supplies by ship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/world/americas/17haiti.html?pagewanted=all|title=Officials Strain to Distribute Aid to Haiti as Violence Rises - NYTimes.com|first1=Ginger|last1=Thompson|first2=Damien|last2=Cave|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 January 2010}}</ref>

As the city's infrastructure suffered little damage, numerous businessmen and many residents have moved here from Port-au-Prince. The airport is patrolled by [[Chile]]an [[UN]] troops since the 2010 earthquake, and several hundred UN personnel have been assigned to the city as part of the ongoing United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ([[MINUSTAH]]). They are working on recovery throughout the island.

After the earthquake, the port of [[Labadee]] was demolished and the pier enlarged and completely re-paved with concrete, which now allows larger cruise ships to dock, rather than [[tendering]] passengers to shore.

===Cap-Haïtien fuel tanker explosion===

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2024}}

A union of four Catholic Church private schools have been present for two decades in Cap‑Haïtien. They have higher-level grades, equivalent to the lycées that feed the Écoles Normale Supérieure in France. They have high standards of academic excellence, selectivity in [[University and college admissions|admissions]], and generally their students come from the social and economic elite. Also, the lyceé Philippe Guerrier that was built in 1844 by the Haitian President, Philippe Guerrier, has been a fountain of knowledge for more than a century.
