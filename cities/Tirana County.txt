'''Tirana County''' ({{lang-sq|Qarku Tiranë|italic=unset}}), officially the '''County of Tirana''' ({{lang-sq|Qarku i Tiranës|italic=unset}}), is a [[Counties of Albania|county]] in the [[Central Albania|Central Region]] of [[Albania]]. It is the tenth largest by area and the [[List of counties of Albania by population|most populous]] of the twelve counties, with more than 912,000 people within an area of {{convert|1652|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The county borders on the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the west, the counties of [[Durrës County|Durrës]] to the northwest, [[Dibër County|Dibër]] to the northeast, [[Elbasan County|Elbasan]] to the east and [[Fier County|Fier]] to the southwest. It is divided into five [[Municipalities of Albania|municipalities]], [[Tirana]], [[Kamëz]], [[Kavajë]], [[Rrogozhinë]] and [[Vorë]], with all of whom incorporate twenty-nine [[Villages of Tirana County|administrative units]].

[[Geography of Albania|Geographically]], Tirana extends from the high and rugged [[Skanderbeg Mountains]] in the east to the flat shores of the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]] along the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Due to its location and the close proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]], its climate is particularly influenced by a [[Mediterranean climate]] with four distinct seasons. Two of the country's fourteen [[National parks of Albania|National Parks]] are located in the county, with [[Dajti Mountain National Park|Dajti]] in the center and [[Divjakë-Karavasta National Park|Divjakë-Karavasta]] in the southwest.
 
[[History of Albania|Historically]], Tirana has been populated since [[Paleolithic]] times dating back 10,000 to 30,000 years ago. As argued by various archaeologists, the populated places are filled with [[Illyrians|Ancient Illyrian]] [[toponyms]], as its precincts are some of the earliest regions in Albania to be inhabited. Nevertheless, the city of Tirana was established as a city centuries later in 1614 during the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman occupation of Albania]].

The capital of the county is [[Tirana]], which is also the largest city by area and population in Albania. A [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|gamma-world-city]], it is the most influential economic and political center of the country.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] (GaWC) |title=The World According to GaWC 2020 |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |access-date=13 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006165159/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |archive-date=6 October 2020}}</ref>

=== Pre-Albanian Independence===
{{See also|Illyria|Illyrians}}

The region, which presently corresponds to the territory of the county of Tirana, has been continuously inhabited since the [[Paleolithic]] some 10,000 to 30,000 years ago, as suggested by evidence from tools [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] near [[Dajti|Mount Dajt]]'s quarry and within the [[Cave of Pëllumbas]]. As argued by various archaeologists, Tirana and its suburbs are filled with [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] toponyms, as its precincts are some of the earliest inhabited regions in Albania.<ref name="Heppner1994">{{cite book|last=Heppner|first=Harald |title=Hauptstädte in Südosteuropa: Geschichte, Funktion, nationale Symbolkraft  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzVfQTE-dD8C&q=Theranda%20name&pg=PA135|year=1994|publisher=Wien u.a.

The oldest discovery in downtown Tirana was a Roman house, later transformed into an [[aisleless church]] with a mosaic-floor, dating to the 3rd century A.D., with other remains found near a medieval temple at Shengjin Fountain in the eastern suburbs. A castle possibly called ''Tirkan'' or ''Theranda'', whose remnants are found along Murat Toptani Street, was built by Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in 520 A.D. and restored by Ahmed Pasha Toptani in the 18th century.<ref name="Heppner1994"/> The area had no special importance in [[Illyria]]n and [[Classical antiquity|classical]] times. In 1510, [[Marin Barleti]], an Albanian Catholic priest and scholar, in the biography of the Albanian national hero [[Skanderbeg]] referred to this area as a small village.<ref>To know more about the history of Tirana, please consult ''Tirana ne shekuj: Terona, Theranda, Tirkan, Tirannea, Tirana : monografi, disa artikuj e materiale arkivore kushtuar historisë së Tiranës'' by Skënder Jasa.
