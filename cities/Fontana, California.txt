'''Fontana''' is a city in [[San Bernardino County, California]], United States. Founded by [[Azariel Blanchard Miller]] in 1913,<ref name="books.google.com"/> it remained essentially rural until [[World War II]], when entrepreneur [[Henry J. Kaiser]] built a large steel mill in the area. It is now a regional hub of the trucking industry, with the east–west [[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]] and [[Foothill Freeway|State Route 210]] crossing the city and [[Interstate 15 in California|Interstate 15]] passing diagonally through its northwestern quadrant. The city is about {{convert|46|mi|km}} east of [[Los Angeles]].

The [[United States Census Bureau]] reported that Fontana's 2020 population was 208,393, making it the second-most-populous city in San Bernardino County and the 20th largest in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/fontanacitycalifornia,sanbernardinocountycalifornia/POP010220#POP010220 |title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Fontana city, California; San Bernardino County, California |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=April 5, 2022}}</ref>

==History==
Native Americans inhabited the area.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9DRvQBqPXEC&q=fontana+california+native+americans | title=Native Americans of Riverside County | isbn=978-0-7385-4685-8 | last1=Trafzer | first1=Clifford E. | last2=Smith | first2=Jeffrey A. | date=2006 | publisher=Arcadia }}</ref>

Fontana, formerly Rosena from 1898 to 1919,<ref>{{cite web |title=San Bernardino Topographic map 1898 |url=https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/img4/ht_icons/overlay/CA/CA_San%20Bernardino_298863_1898_62500_geo.jpg |publisher=USGS |access-date=August 11, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=About the City of Fontana {{!}} Fontana, CA - Official Website |url=https://www.fontanaca.gov/31/About-Us |website=www.fontanaca.gov |access-date=August 11, 2023}}</ref> was founded in 1919 by [[Azariel Blanchard Miller]].<ref name="books.google.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fusd.net/fusdhistory/schoolnames.stm |title=History of schools in the Fontana Unified School District |publisher=Fusd.net |access-date=December 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123174408/http://fusd.net/fusdhistory/schoolnames.stm |archive-date=November 23, 2010 }}</ref> The name ''fontana'' is [[Italian language|Italian]] for fountain or water source; the city is close to the [[Santa Ana River]] to the east. Within a few years, it became an agricultural town of citrus orchards, vineyards and chicken ranches and astride [[U.S. Route 66]] (now known as [[Foothill Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Foothill Boulevard]]). The Fontana area was radically transformed during [[World War II]] when [[Henry J. Kaiser]] built the [[Kaiser Steel]] plant just outside the city limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-27/fontana-california-warehouses-inland-empire-pollution|title=When your house is surrounded by massive warehouses|last=Esquivel|first=Paloma|date=October 27, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref> At the time, it was one of only two steel mills west of the Mississippi River. To provide for the plant workers' health needs, Henry J. Kaiser constructed the Fontana [[Kaiser Permanente]] medical facility, now the largest managed care organization in the United States.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Fontana was home to a drag racing strip that was a venue in the [[NHRA]] circuit. Mickey Thompson's Fontana International Dragway was also referred to as Fontana Drag City or Fontana Drag Strip. The original Fontana strip is gone, but the owners of [[NASCAR]]'s new [[Auto Club Speedway]] opened a NHRA-sanctioned drag strip just oustside Fontana in mid-2006.

Ro-Val's automobile museum, located on Foothill Boulevard on the western outskirts between Fontana and Cucamonga, was the home for many classic automobiles of the 1920s and 1930s, including a huge vehicle once owned by screen actor [[Fatty Arbuckle]]. When the Ro-Val museum closed, the vehicles were sold to [[Bill Harrah]], a Nevada casino owner and automobile collector, who placed them on display in the museum located at his casino.

In 2000, the city had a total population of 128,929; by 2020, the city had 212,704 residents. This rapid growth was largely due to the numerous large, new residential developments built in the sparsely populated northern part of the city, as well as with the city's aggressive (and highly successful) campaign to annex several unincorporated, but developed, San Bernardino County areas in 2006–2007.

In 2019, the [[California Air Resources Board]] advised the City against housing people within 1,000 feet of industrial warehouses because of harmful truck pollution.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-27/fontana-california-warehouses-inland-empire-pollution|title=When your house is surrounded by massive warehouses|date=October 27, 2019|newspaper=Los Angeles Times }}</ref> The city was also sued by San Bernardino County, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club and the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice over the approval of West Valley Logistics Center, which violated state environmental laws.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sbsun.com/san-bernardino-county-environmental-groups-sue-fontana-over-massive-warehouse-complex|title=San Bernardino County, environmental groups sue Fontana over massive warehouse complex|date=April 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/west-valley-logistics-center-04-12-2019.php |title=Lawsuit Challenges Massive Southern California Warehouse Project |publisher=Biologicaldiversity.org |date=April 12, 2019 |accessdate=April 5, 2022}}</ref>

In 2021, the city was sued by the State of California Attorney General's office for violation of the California Environmental Quality Act by encouraging warehouse development in low-income areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailybulletin.com/2021/07/26/state-sues-fontana-to-block-sprawling-warehouse-project-in-low-income-area|title=State sues Fontana to block sprawling warehouse project in low-income area|date=July 26, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sbcsentinel.com/2021/07/california-attorney-general-sues-fontana-to-end-warehouse-oversaturation/|title=California Attorney General Sues Fontana To End Warehouse Oversaturation &#124; SBCSentinel|date=July 24, 2021 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Most of the city of Fontana, like its eastern neighbors [[Rialto, California|Rialto]] and [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], is built atop a geologically young, gently southward-sloping [[alluvial fan]] from nearby [[Lytle Creek (California)|Lytle Creek]], deposited mainly during the [[Holocene]] and late-[[Pleistocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epochs]]. There are also sedimentary deposits of similar age from Etiwanda Creek on the western edge of the city. However, the northern and southern edges of the city are formed by the much older [[San Gabriel Mountains|San Gabriel]] and Jurupa mountain ranges, respectively. The Jurupa Mountains are composed primarily of [[Cretaceous]] and [[Paleozoic]]-[[era (geology)|era]] rocks, as are the San Gabriels, which also include even older, [[Proterozoic]] formations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of03-418/fon_map.pdf|title=Preliminary Geologica Map of the Fontana 7.5' Quadrangle, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, California|publisher=USGS|first1=D.

Additionally, the Cucamonga [[Fault (geology)|Fault]] Zone, contiguous with the Sierra Madre Fault Zone, runs through the northern part of the city, along the base of the San Gabriels, notably through the Hunter's Ridge and Coyote Canyon [[planned communities]]. It is estimated to be capable of producing earthquakes approximately of magnitude 6.0-7.0.<ref>[http://www.data.scec.org/significant/cucamonga.html Cucamonga Fault Zone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507193816/http://www.data.scec.org/significant/cucamonga.html |date=May 7, 2012 }}. Data.scec.org. Retrieved on October 19, 2010.</ref>

The city's listed elevation, measured from the northeast corner of the intersection of Upland Avenue and Sierra Avenue, downtown by City Hall, is {{convert|1237|ft|m}}. The highest elevation within the city limits is approximately {{convert|2,600|ft|m}}, in the northernmost part of the Panorama neighborhood of Hunter's Ridge. The lowest point within the city limits is approximately {{convert|840|ft|m}}, at the intersection of Etiwanda and Philadelphia avenues, in the extreme southwestern corner of the city.<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=34.103561,-117.454147&spn=0.146404,0.350189&t=p&z=12 Google Maps]. Google.com (January 1, 1970). Retrieved on October 19, 2010.</ref> This difference in elevation is due to the southward slope of the Lytle Creek alluvial fan.

===Climate===
The city is frequently affected by the strong, hot and dry [[Santa Ana winds]] as they blow through the nearby [[Cajon Pass]] of the San Gabriel Mountains, from the [[Mojave Desert]]. Fontana can also be extremely hot in summer, well over {{convert|100|F|C}}.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KONT&SafeCityName=Fontana&StateCode=CA&Units=none&IATA=PMD Seasonal Average Weather Graph at Ontario Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406115805/http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KONT&SafeCityName=Fontana&StateCode=CA&Units=none&IATA=PMD |date=April 6, 2008 }} Fontana Weather</ref>
