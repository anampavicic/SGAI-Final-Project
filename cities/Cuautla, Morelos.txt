==History==
===Prehispanic history===
The [[Olmec]] group who lived in [[Chalcatzingo]] (southeast of Cuautla) founded settlements in Cuautla, Tepalcingo, Jonacatepec (Las Pilas), Olintepec, Atlihuayan, Huaxtepec, Gualupita de Cuernavaca, Tlayacapan, etc. (Piña Chan y Plancarte).

Five years after the conquest of [[Cuernavaca|''Cuahunahuác'' (Cuernavaca)]] in (1379 CE),<ref name="gob">{{cite web |title=Cuernavaca |url=https://morelos.gob.mx/?q=cuernavaca |website=Cuernavaca {{!}} MORELOS |access-date=May 11, 2020 |language=es |date=31 May 2013}}</ref> [[Moctezuma Ilhuicamina]] conquered Huaxtepec ([[Oaxtepec]]), Yautepec, Tlayacapan and other towns of Morelos and Guerrero. With Huaxtepec, which was the prehispanic and colonial capital of the peoples of the ''Plan de Amilpas'', its 25-human settlements including ''Cuauhtlán'', had to pay a tribute of 400 cotton blankets, 400 two-color valances, 400 bedspreads, 800 thin cotton blankets, 400 pairs of shorts (''patees''), 200 women's shirts, and 1,200 veils (''mantillas'') every 80 days. In addition, they were required to contribute labor.

===Spanish conquest and colonial period===
The ''Plan de Amilpas'' including Cuautla was conquered by Captain [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] on March 14, 1521. In 1543 [[New Spain]] was organized into four provinces: Michoacán, México, Coatzacoalcos, and Las Mixtecas; the present territory of Morelos was part of the Mexico province.<ref name="gob" />

The church and monastery of [[James the Less|San Diego]] were built between 1560 and 1580. The church is relatively small and austere, although there is a beautiful cupola on the south side. The [[Facade|façade]] of the church is made of pink [[granite]] with well-defined bases, columns, and [[cornice]]s. The small, two-level belltower is square and simple. The monetary is high and formal; it may have been built after the church. The church is unique in that it faces the east, there is no real [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], and there are neither ''[[capillas posa]]s'' nor an open chapel.<ref name=convent>{{cite book |last1=Moro V. |first1=Agustín |title=Catálogo gráfico de los Conventos del S. XCI en Morelos |date=1993 |publisher=Publi JVS |location=Cuernavaca, Morelos |page=50 |trans-title=Graphic Catalog of 16th Century Monasteries in Morelos|language=es}}</ref> Construction of the church of [[Saint Dominic|Santo Domingo]] also began in the middle of the 16th century, but there is little information on it.<ref name=convent />

After the conquest, Indigenous lands were confiscated, mostly for sugar cane plantations and mills (''trapiches''). Despite Indigenous protests, Viceroy [[Gaspar de Zúñiga, 5th Count of Monterrey|Gaspar de Zúñiga]] ruled in favor of the colonists on July 5, 1603. In 1646 the province of México became the ''[[Real Audiencia]];'' Cuautla became an ''alcaldia'' (mayoralty) belonging to the [[Intendant (government official)|Intendencia]] of Puebla.<ref name="gob" />

===Independence & 19th century===
After a number of successful battles, General [[José María Morelos]] arrived in Cuautla in December 1811. On February 19, 1812, Spanish General [[Félix María Calleja]] began the 72-day [[Siege of Cuautla]]. Morelos was accompanied by [[Leonardo Bravo (general officer)|Leonardo Bravo]], [[Mariano Matamoros]], [[Hermenegildo Galeana]], [[Nicolás Bravo]], and [[Manuel de Ordiera]]. 12-year-old [[Narciso Mendoza]], known as the ''Niño Artillero'' (Child Gunner) is remembered for stopping an advance of royalist troops by setting off a cannon.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Doralicia Carmona Dávila |title=Memoria Política de México |url=https://www.memoriapoliticademexico.org/Efemerides/3/05031812.html |website=www.memoriapoliticademexico.org |publisher=Edición Perenne |access-date=May 11, 2020 |ref=ISBN 970-95193 |language=es |date=2020}}</ref> Morelos and his army were able to break out on May 2, 1812.

Cuautla was designated a ''Heroic City'' (''Heroica Ciudad de Morelos'') on April 4, 1829, while Felipe B. Montero was ''Presidente Municipal'' (mayor).<ref name="inafed" />

An 1865 photograph shows the construction of the second floor of the ''Palacio Municipal'' (city hall) in 1865. The building was burned during the Revolution.<ref name="HHHCuautla">{{cite web |title=CUAUTLA: CIUDAD HISTÓRICA, HEROICA Y HERMOSA |url=http://revista.morelos.gob.mx/conociendo-morelos/cuautla-ciudad-historica-heroica-y-hermosa |website=Revista - Morelos Yo Soy la Nueva Visión |access-date=May 11, 2020 |language=es |date=10 September 2014}}</ref>

===Revolution & 20th century===
As a young man, [[Emiliano Zapata]] was concerned about land seizures in Anenecuilco, his hometown. In May [[1911 in Mexico|1911]] he answered [[Francisco I. Madero]]'s call to arms against President [[Porfirio Díaz]]. After minor battles in [[Chietla Municipality|Chietla]], [[Izúcar de Matamoros|Izúcar]], [[Metepec]] [[Atlixco]], Yautepec, and Jonacatepec, he arrived at Cuautla on May 11, 1911. With 4,000 or 5,000 troops he surrounded the city, and the week-long [[Battle of Cuautla (1911)]] began. The battle was a major turning point in the [[Mexican Revolution]], as Porfirio Díaz said the battle convinced him to sign the [[Treaty of Ciudad Juárez]] and resign.<ref name=zap />

Nearly seven years later, in April [[1919 in Mexico|1919]], Colonel Jesus Guajardo assassinated Zapata, apparently under orders of President [[Venustiano Carranza]] in [[Chinameca, Morelos|Hacienda Chinameca, Ayala]]. His body was placed on a mule and left on the street before he was brought to Cuautla for burial.<ref name=zap>{{cite web |title=Biografía de Emiliano Zapata - Portal Libertario OACA |url=https://www.portaloaca.com/historia/biografias/47-biografia-de-emiliano-zapata.html |website=www.portaloaca.com |access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref>

The city hall was burned during the Battle of Cuautla in 1911; the bell ''Nuestra Señora de Dolores'' was transferred from the Church of Guadalupita on February 19, 2017 when the city hall was restored.<ref name="inafed" />

Both are refilled regularly at the same time by the city. When necessary the water is [[pump]]ed from the ''cisterna'' to the ''Tinaco''.  These {{convert|1100|L|USgal impgal|adj=on|sp=us}}<ref>[https://rotoplas.com.mx/catalogo/tinaco/ different sizes]</ref> water tanks let water out into [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] which have [[valve]]s that are opened as needed to wash clothes and dishes or to bathe or flush the toilet.

===Climate===
The city is quite warm year-round.
In the winter, there is a slight decrease in both the daytime and nighttime temperatures, and because of Cuautla's relative proximity south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and its altitude (about {{convert|4,500|ft|m|disp=or|sp=us}} above sea level), the nighttime temperatures year-round usually average about {{cvt|57|°F|°C}}. On the other hand, because Cuautla is somewhat close to the [[Equator]], temperatures year-round tend to reach into the mid-80s to lower 90s°F (upper 20s°C to the lower 30s°C) even during the winter, and in spring on many days the daytime temperatures may reach well into the upper 90s°F (lower 30s°C).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weatherspark.com/y/6484/Average-Weather-in-Cuautla-Mexico-Year-Round|title = Cuautla Climate, Weather by Month, Average Temperature (Cuautla, Mexico) - Weather Spark}}</ref>
