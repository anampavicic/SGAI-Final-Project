==Demographics==
The [[Sukuma people|Sukuma]] constitute over 90 percent of the population of the [[Mwanza Region]]. Other ethnic groups in the region, in much smaller proportions, include the [[Zinza]], [[Haya people|Haya]], [[Sumbwa]], [[Nyamwezi people|Nyamwezi]], [[Luo peoples|Luo]], [[w:Kurya people|Kurya]], [[Jita people|Jita]], Shashi and Kerewe. They live mainly in the Mwanza city area. National policy, however, gives very little importance to ethnic groupings and reliable data is difficult to find.<ref>[http://www.tzonline.org/pdf/Mwanza.pdf Section 1.2, "Mwanza Region Socio-Economic Profile", joint publication by the Planning Commission Dar es Salaam and the Regional Commissioner's Office Mwanza, October 1997, page 4]</ref>

== Climate ==
Mwanza features a [[tropical savanna climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, tempered by the city's altitude.

The city features a lengthy [[wet season]] which runs from October through May and a short pronounced [[dry season]] that covers the remaining four months. Mwanza receives on average roughly {{convert|1050|mm}} of precipitation annually.
