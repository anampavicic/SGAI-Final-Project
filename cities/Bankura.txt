'''Bankura''' ({{IPA-all|bænˈkʊərə|pron}}) is a city and a municipality in the state of [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Bankura district]].Bankura was described as malbhumi 
. The word {{transliteration|nhh|larh}} or {{transliteration|nhh|rarh}} (in Nagari: rāḍh) was introduced after 6th century A.D. It comes from the old Austric word ráŕhá or ráŕho which means “land of red soil”.<ref name="Civilization, Ananda Marga Publications 1981">P.R. Sarkar Rarh - The Cradle of Civilization, Ananda Marga Publications, 1981, Kolkata</ref> 2-n ancient times "China called Ráŕh by the name of 'Láti'".<ref name="Civilization, Ananda Marga Publications 1981" /> 3-n Santali, {{transliteration|nhh|lar}} means thread, {{transliteration|nhh|rarh}} means tune and {{transliteration|nhh|larh}} means snake. 4-.Perhaps the Jain and Greek scholars used this original Austric word {{transliteration|nhh|larh}} to indicate this dry forest region which was very difficult. The popularity of Manasa Puja, the worship of Snake-Goddess Manasa, shows this opinion might have some relevance. According to Nilkantha, a commentator of the Mahabharata, the words {{transliteration|sa|suhmo [bhumi]}} (Sanskrit: suhma-bhūmi) and Rarh are synonymous.

Scholars differs in their opinion about the etymology of the name Bankura. In the words of the Kol-Mundas, orah or rah means habitation. Many places of Rarh have an added rah at the end of their names. One of the most influential gods of the district 6-Dharmathakur is called Bankura Roy. The name of the district may come from his name. Linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterjee thinks that the name came from the word banka (zig-zag), and its word-corruption banku, which means extremely beautiful, and he who must be worshiped. In 1979, the word “Bancoorah” was found in the map of Renal. In 1863, Gastrel referred this region as Bancoonda.

Bir Hambir was the 49th King of  Malla dynasty. Bir Bankura was one of his two sons. Raja Bir Hambir divided his kingdom into 22 tarafs or circles and gave one to his each son. Taraf Jaybelia fell to the lot of Bir Bankura. He developed a town in his taraf and the town was later named as 'Bankura' after its founder's name.

===Area overview===
The map alongside shows the Bankura Sadar subdivision of Bankura district. Physiographically, this area is part of the Bankura Uplands in the west gradually merging with the Bankura-Bishnupur Rarh Plains in the north-east. The western portions are characterised by undulating terrain with many hills and ridges. The area is having a gradual descent from the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]]. The soil is [[laterite]] red and hard beds are covered with scrub jungle and [[Shorea robusta|sal]] wood. Gradually it gives way to just uneven rolling lands but the soil continues to be lateritic. There are coal mines in the northern part, along the [[Damodar River]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1913_PART_A_DCHB_BANKURA.pdf|title =  District Census Handbook Bankura |work = pages 13-17 | publisher= Directorate of Census Operations West Bengal | access-date = 23 April 2020}}</ref> It is a predominantly rural area with 89% of the population living in rural areas and only 11% living in the urban areas.<ref>{{cite web  |url = http://wbpspm.gov.in/publications/District%20Statistical%20Hanbook  |title = District Statistical Handbook 2013 Darjeeling  |work = Table 2.4b  |publisher = Department of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of West Bengal  |access-date = 23 April 2020  }}{{Dead link|date=May 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
