'''Kasganj''' is a [[city]], or ''nagar,'' and the district headquarters of [[Kasganj district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The district was formed by grouping three [[tehsils]] on 17 April 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About District {{!}} Kasganj {{!}} India|url=https://kasganj.nic.in/about-district/|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-03}}</ref> 

==History==
Kasganj, which lies in the historical region of [[Braj]], was also known as "Khasganj" during [[Mughal India|Mughal]] and [[British Raj|British]] periods. According to ''Imperial Gazetteer of India Vol. XV'' (1908) by [[William Wilson Hunter]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhMPgAACAAJ|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India: Vol. Xv: Karachi To Kottayam|last=Hunter|first=W. W.|isbn=9788170191117|language=en}}</ref> Kasganj came in the hands of James V. Gardner, who was employed by the [[Maratha Confederacy|Marathas]] and later by the British service. Gardner later died in Chhaoni, Kasganj.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I206379&tree=Welsh |title=James Valentine Gardner of, Khasganj, Uttar Pradesh, India d. 14 Jun 1845 Chhaoni, , India: Community Trees Project |access-date=21 December 2014 |archive-date=21 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221093517/https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I206379&tree=Welsh |url-status=dead }}</ref> Gardner's father Colonel [[William Linnaeus Gardner]] was also stationed there. William Gardner built his estate in Kasganj after retiring from the army. He also died in Kasganj, in July of 1835.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I206372&tree=Welsh |title=Colonel William Linnæus Gardner b. 1770 of, , Staffordshire, England d. 29 Jul 1835 Khasganj, Uttar Pradesh, India: Community Trees Project |access-date=21 December 2014 |archive-date=21 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221092041/https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I206372&tree=Welsh |url-status=dead }}</ref> William and James Gardner belonged to the [[Lineage (genetic)|lineage]] of [[Baron Gardner]] of [[Uttoxeter|Uttoxeter, England]]. Famous writer and historian [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] came to Kasganj in search of Julian Gardner, heir to the English Barony, while researching for his book ''[[White Mughals]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/08/india.lords|title=Peer into the past|last=Dalrymple|first=William|date=2003-12-08|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-07}}</ref> The book ''Wanderings of a Pilgrim in Search of the Picturesque'' by [[Fanny Parkes]] gives details of her visits to Kasganj (then called "Khasgunge") and mentions the town and the Gardner family.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCK8AAAAIAAJ|title=Wanderings of a Pilgrim in Search of the Picturesque|last1=Parlby|first1=Fanny Parkes|last2=Ghose|first2=Indira|last3=Mills|first3=Sara|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719053504|language=en}}</ref>

An older description mentioned Kasganj as standing on an elevated site, its drainage flowing towards the [[Kali River (Karnataka)|Kali Nadi]] ("black stream"), which runs about a mile southeast of the town. The town was constituted a [[municipality]] in 1868. Kasganj's position in the strategic [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indo-Gangetic]] plain figured in military and political vicissitudes of ancient kingdoms, from the [[Mahabharata]] onwards. It formed part of the grand empire of  [[Harshavardhana]], and it finds mention in the accounts of the 7th century Chinese pilgrim Hsien Tsang ([[Xuanzang]]), who passed this way in 647 AD.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjKURHnitt8C|title=Gardner of Gardner's Horse, 2nd Lancers, Indian Army|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Abhinav Publications|language=en}}</ref>

Near Kasganj is a [[village]] called Atranjikhera, where Lord [[Gautam Buddha]] once kept his anniversary, and the place is revered as a holy pilgrim place for [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. Excavations began in 1962 and revealed that site was occupied from 1200 BCE to 300 BCE<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/HistRefMain.asp?iPin=EAAC0064&SID=2&DatabaseName=Ancient+and+Medieval+History+Online&InputText=%22Atranjikhera%22&SearchStyle=&dTitle=Atranjikhera&TabRecordType=All+Records&BioCountPass=0&SubCountPass=2&DocCountPass=0&ImgCountPass=0&MapCountPass=0&FedCountPass=&MedCountPass=0&NewsCountPass=0&RecPosition=1&AmericanData=&WomenData=&AFHCData=&IndianData=&WorldData=&AncientData=Set&GovernmentData= |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 December 2014 |archive-date=1 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701175010/http://www.fofweb.com/History/HistRefMain.asp?iPin=EAAC0064&SID=2&DatabaseName=Ancient+and+Medieval+History+Online&InputText=%22Atranjikhera%22&SearchStyle=&dTitle=Atranjikhera&TabRecordType=All+Records&BioCountPass=0&SubCountPass=2&DocCountPass=0&ImgCountPass=0&MapCountPass=0&FedCountPass=&MedCountPass=0&NewsCountPass=0&RecPosition=1&AmericanData=&WomenData=&AFHCData=&IndianData=&WorldData=&AncientData=Set&GovernmentData= |url-status=dead }}</ref> Various artifacts and ruined structures from the ancient town have been found in Atranji Khera Achalpur ([[Chauhan Dynasty|Chauhan]]'s kingdom). Another village near Kasganj, Jakhera, is also a major archaeological excavation site. Iron tools such as [[Sickle|sickles]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], [[Plowshare|ploughshares]] and [[terracotta]] figurines dating back from 1000 BCE to 600 BCE have been found in Jakhera. This suggests that Jakhera was a part of the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]] and the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] culture of [[ancient India]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/sites/silkroad/files/knowledge-bank-article/vol_I%20silk%20road_the%20painted%20grey%20ware%20culture%20of%20the%20iron%20age.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 April 2015 |archive-date=15 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615064201/http://en.unesco.org/silkroad/sites/silkroad/files/knowledge-bank-article/vol_I%20silk%20road_the%20painted%20grey%20ware%20culture%20of%20the%20iron%20age.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Research conducted on these artifacts suggests that Kasganj has had a rich history since [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[medieval]] times. Kasganj was founded by Nawab Yaqoot Ali Khan, a descendant of the [[Nawab|Nawabs]] of [[Farrukhabad]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The city was known as Yaqoot Ganj in the early sixteenth century.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The inscription regarding its establishment is still visible in the city's [[Jama Masjid]] ("big mosque"). It is said that the well-protected building at Tehsil Road, which houses the [[tehsil]], was the residence of Nawab Yaqoot Ali Khan until it was acquired by the British after fall of Awadh. Later, the city came into the hands of Kunwar Maharaj Singh Jain, then succeeded by the late Kumar Bhartendra Singh Jain, the only [[Zamindar|Zamindars]] of the city. The city was established in this location because it represented a centre point in the road connections between various small, ancient cities of District Etah, such as [[Bilram]], [[Marehra]], [[Etah]], Sakeet, Atranji Khera, and [[Aligarh]].
