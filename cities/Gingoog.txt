'''Gingoog''' ({{IPA-all|'hiŋuʔog}} {{Respell|HEE|ngu|og}}), officially the '''City of Gingoog''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Hingoog}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Gingoog}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Misamis Oriental]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 136,698 people.{{PH census|current}}

Like other municipalities in the Philippines that retained [[List of Philippine city name etymologies|Spanish-based orthography]], the city name is spelled as ''Gingoog'' but is pronounced as {{IPA-all|'hiŋuʔog|}} or {{Respell|HEE|ngu|og}} since it originated as a [[Bukid language|Binukid]] word.

== History ==
The term Gingoog originally came from the word "Hingoog", which means "Goodluck", from a [[Lumad]] tribe of [[Manobo]] who settled in the area.<ref>Gingoog</ref> The word implies good fortune, thus Gingoog means the "City of Good Luck". The natives of this place are the ones with the family names of "Gingco", and "Gingoyon".

Gingoog was founded as a mission by [[Jesuits|Spanish missionaries]] in 1750. It was one of the oldest localities in [[Misamis Oriental|Misamis Oriental Province]], older than the province's capital and economic hub, [[Cagayan de Oro]] which was founded in 1871.

The territory of then-independent Gingoog was made part of [[Talisayan]] for a while, since the passage of ''Act No. 951'', issued by the [[Philippine Commission]] on October 21, 1903, which reduced the number of municipalities in [[Misamis (province)|the then-undivided Misamis province]] from 24 to 10,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20951 |title=Act No. 951 |date=October 21, 1903 |website=Legislative Digital Resources |publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 11, 2024}}</ref> until becoming the first former municipality to be reconstituted thereafter through ''Act No. 1618'', enacted on March 20, 1907 and took effect on August 10.<ref>{{cite book |date=1908 |title=Public Laws Passed by the Philippine Constitution, volume VI |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjtBAQAAMAAJ |location=[[Manila]] |publisher=Bureau of Printing |pages=102–103 |access-date=March 14, 2024 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

During the early 20th century, with its abundant natural resources, Gingoog slowly continued to edge forward their economic progress, attracting migrants from [[Luzon]] and [[Visayas]] to settle in the area as their new home. After the World War II, the fast and vast production output of agriculture (specifically coconut & coffee) and logging industry created a momentum of progress that led to the initiation of Gingoog’s early independence from the Province of Misamis Oriental.

In 1957, the sitio of Binuangan was converted into a barrio known as Talisay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1744.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714030502/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1744.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=An Act Creating the Barrio of Talisay, Municipality of Giñgoog, Province of Misamis Oriental |publisher=LawPH.com |access-date=April 12, 2011 }}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Gingoog was turned into a city via Republic Act No. 2668 signed by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] circa June 18, 1960.<ref>[https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1960/06/30/proclamation-no-686-s-1960/ Proclamation No. 686, s. 1960: Republic Act No. 2668]</ref>

== Geography ==
Gingoog is located in the Province of [[Misamis Oriental]] in the [[Northern Mindanao]] Region on [[Mindanao]] island. The city is approximately {{Convert|122|km}} east of [[Cagayan de Oro]] and {{Convert|74|km}} west of [[Butuan]]. It is bounded on the east by the Municipality of [[Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental|Magsaysay]]; on the west by the Municipality of [[Medina, Misamis Oriental|Medina]]; on the south by the Municipality of [[Claveria, Misamis Oriental|Claveria]]; and on the north by Gingoog Bay. Its total land area is {{Convert|56844|ha}}.

=== Barangays ===
Gingoog is politically subdivided into 79 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s  while some have [[sitios]].

In 1957, the sitio of Malibod was converted into a barrio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1717.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711070312/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1717.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |title=An Act Creating a Certain Barrio in the Municipality of Gingoog, Province of Misamis Oriental |publisher=LawPH.com |access-date=April 12, 2011 }}</ref>
