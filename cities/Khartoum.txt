With a population of 6,344,348, Khartoum's metropolitan area is the largest in Sudan. 

Khartoum is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[White Nile]] – flowing north from [[Lake Victoria]] – and the [[Blue Nile]], flowing west from [[Lake Tana]] in [[Ethiopia]]. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum [[metropolitan area]] is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to [[Khartoum North]] ({{lang|ar|الخرطوم بحري}} {{transliteration|ar|ALA|al-Kharṭūm Baḥrī}}) and [[Omdurman]] ({{lang|ar|أم درمان}} {{transliteration|ar|ALA|Umm Durmān}}) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as ''al-Mogran'' or ''al-Muqran'' ({{lang|ar|المقرن}}; English: "The Confluence").

Khartoum was founded in 1821 by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], north of the ancient city of [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. In 1882 the [[British Empire]] [[Anglo-Egyptian War|took control]] of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the [[Mahdist War]], the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the [[Siege of Khartoum]] in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by [[Mahdist State|Mahdist]] forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's government until 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Khartoum|title=Khartoum {{!}} Location, Facts, & History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28|archive-date=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626182639/https://www.britannica.com/place/Khartoum|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an [[Republic of Sudan (1956–1969)|independent Sudan]]. Three hostages were killed during the [[attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum]] in 1973.

In 2008, the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] engaged in [[2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum|combat]] in the city with the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]] as part of the [[War in Darfur]]. The [[Khartoum massacre]] occurred in 2019 during the [[Sudanese Revolution]]. The city saw [[Battle of Khartoum (2023)|extensive combat]] during the [[2023 Sudan clashes|2023 Sudan conflict]] between the armed forces and the [[Rapid Support Forces]] (RSF), affecting [[Khartoum International Airport]] and other critical sites.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leiro |first=Roberto |date=2023-04-15 |title=Sudan's RSF Clashes with Army in Khartoum Airport |url=https://airwaysmag.com/sudans-rsf-clashes-with-army-in-khartoum-airport/ |access-date=2023-04-16 |website=Airways |language=en-US |archive-date=16 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416183624/https://airwaysmag.com/sudans-rsf-clashes-with-army-in-khartoum-airport/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Khartoum is an economic and trade center in [[North Africa]], with rail lines from [[Port Sudan]] and [[El-Obeid]]. It is served by [[Khartoum International Airport]] with the [[New Khartoum International Airport]] under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the [[National Museum of Sudan]], the [[Khalifa House Museum]], the [[University of Khartoum]], and the [[Sudan University of Science and Technology]].

==Etymology==

The origin of the word ''Khartoum'' is uncertain. 
Scholars posit that the name derives from the [[Dinka language|Dinka]] words {{lang|din|khar-tuom}} (Dinka-Bor dialect) or {{lang|din|khier-tuom}} (as is the pronunciation in various Dinka dialects), translating to "place where rivers meet". This is supported by historical accounts which place the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] homeland in central Sudan (around present-day Khartoum) as recently as the 13th-17th centuries A.D.<ref>{{cite book |last=Room |first=Adrian |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C |title=Placenames of the World |edition=2nd |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-2248-3 |page=194 |access-date=15 November 2015 |archive-date=19 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230219022556/https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C |url-status=live }}</ref>

One [[folk etymology]] is that it is derived from [[Arabic]] {{transliteration|ar|ALA|khurṭūm}} ({{lang|ar|خرطوم}} {{gloss|trunk}} or {{gloss|hose}}), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sudan's Blood Memory: The Legacy of War, Ethnicity, and Slavery in Early South Sudan |last=Beswick |first=Stephanie |page=39 |date=2013 |publisher=University Rochester Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r61i6BD0Vw0C&q=damadim+ancient+nubia&pg=PA39 |isbn=9781580461511 |access-date=14 November 2020 |archive-date=19 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230419233116/https://books.google.com/books?id=r61i6BD0Vw0C&q=damadim+ancient+nubia&pg=PA39 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Captain [[James Augustus Grant|J.A. Grant]], who reached Khartoum in 1863 with [[John Hanning Speke|Captain Speke]]'s expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic {{transliteration|ar|ALA|qurtum}} ({{lang|ar|قرطم}} {{gloss|safflower}}, i.e., ''[[Carthamus tinctorius]]''), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walkley |first1=C.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Khartoum}}

===19th century===
[[File:Slave market Khartoum 19th c.png|thumb|right|In the [[slave auction|slave-market]] at Khartoum]]
In 1821, Khartoum was established {{cvt|15|mi|km|order=flip}} north of the ancient city of [[Soba (city)|Soba]], by Ismail Kamil Pasha, the third son of Egypt's ruler, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the [[Egyptian Army]], but the settlement quickly grew into a regional center of trade. It also became a focal point for the [[slavery in Sudan|slave trade]].<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 139</ref> Later, it became the administrative center and official capital of Sudan.

On 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]] started the [[siege of Khartoum]], against occupying British led by General [[Charles George Gordon]]. The siege ended in a massacre of the Anglo-Egyptian garrison when on 26 January 1885 the heavily damaged city fell to the Mahdists.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hammond |first=Peter |title=Slavery, Terrorism & Islam |publisher=Christian Liberty Books |place=Cape Town, South Africa |year=2005}}</ref>

On 2 September 1898, neighboring [[Omdurman]] was the scene of the bloody [[Battle of Omdurman]], during which British forces under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]] defeated the Mahdist forces defending the city.<ref>Britannica,

[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1888) b 617.jpg|thumb|Khartoum in 1888|left]]During World War II, the Italian Empire attempted to advance into Sudan from [[Italian East Africa|Ethiopia]], with the end goal of capturing Khartoum. However, the [[Northern front, East Africa, 1940|Italian attack]] was repelled by British forces in Sudan.

The fourth [[Arab League]] summit was held in Khartoum on 29 August 1967.

In 1973, the city was the site of a [[Attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum|hostage crisis]] in which members of [[Black September Organization|Black September]] held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian ''chargé d'affaires'' were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 [[United States Department of State]] document, declassified in 2006, concluded: "The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of [[Yasser Arafat]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/67584.pdf |title=The Seizure of the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum |website=U.S. Department of State |access-date=2014-01-28 |archive-date=2 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802205255/https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/67584.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as [[Chad]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Uganda]]. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums on the city's outskirts. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from [[South Sudan]] and [[Darfur]] – fleeing the violence of the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] and [[Darfur conflict]] – have settled around Khartoum.

In 1991, [[Osama bin Laden]] purchased [[Osama bin Laden's house in Khartoum|a house]] in the affluent [[Riyad, Khartoum|al-Riyadh]] neighborhood of the city and another in [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], the United States accused bin Laden's [[al-Qaeda]] group and, on 20 August, launched [[cruise missile]] attacks on the [[al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]] in [[Khartoum North]]. The factory's destruction created diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cybriwsky |first=Roman Adrian |title=Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2013 |isbn=9781610692489 |pages=140}}</ref>

In November 1991, the government of President [[Omar al-Bashir]] sought to remove half the population from the city. The residents, deemed [[Squatting in Sudan|squatters]], were mostly southern Sudanese whom the government feared could be potential rebel sympathizers. Around 425,000 people were placed in five "Peace Camps" in the desert an hour's drive from Khartoum. The camps were watched over by heavily armed security guards, many relief agencies were banned from assisting, and "the nearest food was at a market four miles away, a vast journey in the desert heat." Many residents were reduced to having only burlap sacks as housing. The intentional displacement was part of a large urban renewal plan backed by the housing minister, Sharaf Bannaga.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Me against my brother : at war in Somalia, Sudan, and Rwanda : a journalist reports from the battlefields of Africa |author=Peterson, Scott |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415921988 |location=New York |oclc=43287853}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0331/31041.html |title=Khartoum Squatters Forcibly Displaced |date=1992-03-31 |work=The Christian Science Monitor |access-date=2019-03-21 |issn=0882-7729 |archive-date=21 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321211536/https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0331/31041.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/09/world/sudan-is-undeterred-in-drive-to-expel-squatters.html |title=Sudan Is Undeterred in Drive to Expel Squatters |last=Miller |first=Judith |date=1992-03-09 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-03-21 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=2 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200902063209/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/09/world/sudan-is-undeterred-in-drive-to-expel-squatters.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The sudden death of [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] head and vice-president of Sudan [[John Garang]] in late July 2005, was followed by three days of violent [[Riot|riots]] in the capital.

[[Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur]] was a slave trader and the al-Zibar Basha street leads to the military base where the 2019 Khartoum massacre took place.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Burke |first1=Samuel Okiror Jason |last2=Salih |first2=Zeinab Mohammed |date=2020-07-01 |title='Decolonise and rename' streets of Uganda and Sudan, activists urge |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/01/decolonise-and-rename-streets-of-uganda-and-sudan-activists-urge |access-date=2020-07-01 |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=4 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200704012141/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/01/decolonise-and-rename-streets-of-uganda-and-sudan-activists-urge |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 26 October 2021, the city was locked down following [[2021 Sudanese coup d'état|a military coup]] that left at least 7 dead, triggering protests and calls for a general strike. Prime minister [[Abdalla Hamdok]] was arrested during the coup, and held along with other cabinet members in an unknown location.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sudan's capital locked down after coup triggers deadly unrest |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/sudan-s-capital-locked-down-after-coup-triggers-deadly-unrest-1.4710621 |access-date=2021-10-26 |newspaper=The Irish Times |language=en |archive-date=20 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220920173715/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/sudan-s-capital-locked-down-after-coup-triggers-deadly-unrest-1.4710621 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF broke out across Sudan, [[Battle of Khartoum (2023)|including in Khartoum]]. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace, the RSF's headquarters, [[Khartoum International Airport]] and [[Merowe Airport]], the last two of which the RSF claimed to have captured. Gunfire and clashes were also reported at [[El Obeid Airport]] in [[North Kordofan]].

===Climate===
Khartoum features a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') with a dry season occurring during winter, typical of the Saharo-Sahelian zone, which marks the progressive passage between the [[Sahara Desert]]'s vast arid areas and the [[Sahel]]'s vast semi-arid areas. The climate is extremely dry for most of the year, with about eight months when average rainfall is lower than {{cvt|5|mm}}. The very long dry season is itself divided into a warm, very dry season between November and February, as well as a very hot, dry season between March and May. During this part of the year, hot, dry continental [[trade winds]] from deserts, such as the [[harmattan]], sweep over the region; the weather is stable and very dry.

The very irregular, very brief, rainy season lasts about 1 month as the maximum rainfall is recorded in August, with about {{cvt|48|mm}}. The rainy season is characterized by a seasonal reverse of wind regimes, when the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] goes northerly. Average annual rainfall is very low, with only {{cvt|121.3|mm}} of precipitation. Khartoum records on average six days with {{cvt|10|mm}} or more and 19 days with {{cvt|1|mm}} or more of rainfall. The highest temperatures occur during two periods in the year: the first at the late dry season, when average high temperatures consistently exceed {{cvt|40|C}} from April to June, and the second at the early dry season, when average high temperatures exceed {{cvt|39|C}} in September and October. Temperatures cool off somewhat during the night, with Khartoum's lowest average low temperature of the year, in January, just above {{cvt|15|C}}. Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth, with annual mean temperatures hovering around {{cvt|30|C}}. The city also has very warm winters. In no month does the average monthly high temperature fall below {{cvt|30|C}}. This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates, such as [[Riyadh]], [[Baghdad]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf |title=Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification |first=M.

Almost 250,000 Syrians lived in Khartoum as of 2019, representing 5% of the total population of the city. Most are young men who have fled war in Syria. Sudan was the only country in the world to accept travelers carrying a Syrian passport who lacked a visa.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tobin |first1=Sarah A. |title=The New Lost Boys of Sudan |url=https://pomeps.org/the-new-lost-boys-of-sudan |website=The Project on Middle East Political Science |date=13 November 2019 |access-date=4 December 2020 |archive-date=4 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804032250/https://pomeps.org/the-new-lost-boys-of-sudan |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan's oil wealth (although the independence of [[South Sudan]] in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eisourcebook.org/cms/February%202016/sudan-south%20sudan%20authorities%20mgt%20ch6.pdf |title=Country Analysis Brief: Sudan and South Sudan |date=2014-09-03 |website=US Energy Information Administration |pages=13–14 Oil refineries |access-date=2010-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319140658/http://www.eisourcebook.org/cms/February%202016/sudan-south%20sudan%20authorities%20mgt%20ch6.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>). The center of the city has tree-lined streets.<!---a little out of place--> Khartoum has the highest concentration of [[economic activity]] in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the south, the [[Giad|Giad Industrial Complex]] in [[Al Jazirah, Sudan|Al Jazirah]] state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the [[Merowe Dam]] in the North.

Among the city's industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan's largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.<ref name=":0" />

===Retailing===

The [[Souq al Arabi]] is Khartoum's largest open air market. The [[souq]] is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.world-guides.com/africa/north-east-africa/sudan/sudan_shopping.html |title=Sudan Shopping and Districts (Sudan, SD, North-East Africa) |date=2016-06-07 |website=World Guides |publisher=TravelSmart Ltd. |language=en |access-date=2017-07-14 |archive-date=15 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215122348/http://www.world-guides.com/africa/north-east-africa/sudan/sudan_shopping.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Al Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous [[High Street|high streets]] in [[Khartoum State]].

Afra Mall is located in the southern suburb of Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground.

In 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, [[Corinthia Hotel Khartoum|Corinthia Hotel]] Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.

==Education==

[[File:University of Khartoum 002.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Khartoum]]]]

Khartoum is the main location for most of Sudan's top educational bodies. There are four main levels of education:
# [[Kindergarten]] and day-care. It begins in the age of 3–4, consists of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).
# Elementary school. The first grade pupils enter at the age of 6–7. It consists of 8 grades, after which, at 13–14 years old, students are ready to take the certificate exams and enter high school.
# Upper second school and high school. In these three the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, and geography. There are three grades in this level. The students' ages are about 14–15 to 17–18.
# Higher education. There are several universities and colleges in Khartoum, including the [[University of Khartoum]]<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Khartoum |url=https://uofk.edu/ |website=University of Khartoum |access-date=17 June 2024}}</ref> and [[Sudan University of Science and Technology]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sudan University of Science and Technology |url=https://www.sustech.edu/ |website=Sudan University of Science and Technology |access-date=17 June 2024}}</ref>

==Transportation==

[[File:Khartoum public transportation.jpg|alt=Khartoum Public Transportation|thumb|Khartoum public bus]]
Khartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, [[Khartoum International Airport]]. It is the main hub for [[Sudan Airways]], Sudan's main carrier. A new airport was planned for the southern outskirts of the city, but with Khartoum's rapid growth and consequent [[urban sprawl]], the airport is still located in the heart of the city.

Khartoum's transportation is limited to the vehicular road system, with buses and personal vehicles comprising the main types of vehicles. As with many cities in the continent, parts of Khartoum are connected through privately owned buses.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bannaga |first=Sharaf Eldin Ibrahim |date=April 11, 2018 |title=Revitalization of Greater Khartoum Urban Transportation System |journal=Future Cities and Environment |language=en |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=10 |doi=10.5334/fce.2 |issn=2363-9075|doi-access=free|bibcode=2018FutCE...4...10B }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=November 17, 2019 |title=Public transport crisis bothers citizens in Sudan's capital |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/17/c_138560848.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117023505/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/17/c_138560848.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 November 2019 |access-date=2021-10-04 |website=[[Xinhua]]}}</ref>

[[File:The Blue Nile in Khartoum.jpg|thumb|A boat on the [[Blue Nile]] before the [[Al Mansheiya Bridge]].]]
Khartoum has a number of bridges across both tributaries of the Nile. The [[Mac Nimir Bridge]], the [[Blue Nile Road & Railway Bridge]], the [[Cooper Bridge]] (also known as the Armed Forces Bridge), and the [[Elmansheya Bridge]] span the Blue Nile, connecting Khartoum to Khartoum North. The [[Omdurman Bridge]], the Victory Bridge, and the [[Al-Dabbasin Bridge]] span the White Nile, connecting Khartoum to Omdurman. The [[Tuti Bridge]] connects Tuti Island with Khartoum. Prior to the construction of the Tuti Bridge in 2008, residents of Tuti Island relied on [[water taxi]]s to cross the Blue Nile into Khartoum.

Khartoum has rail lines from [[Wadi Halfa]], Port Sudan on the [[Red Sea]], and [[Al-Ubayyid|El Obeid]]. All are operated by [[Sudan Railways]].

== Architecture ==

The architecture of Khartoum reflects the city's history since the early 1820s and is marked by both native Sudanese, Turkish, British and modern buildings. In general, the [[architecture of Sudan]] reflects a wide diversity in its shapes, materials, and use.

Since independence, the people of Sudan have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=1823&order_by=title&showdescription=1archnetr |title=Archnet |website=archnet.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007153505/http://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=1823 |archive-date=7 October 2012}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==

=== Literature ===
Khartoum's unique history and cultural significance have inspired literary works that explore its past, present, and future. For example, in "Reading Khartoum," the city is depicted as a space shaped by movement, political instability, and socio-cultural changes, resulting in underlying layers of meanings and ambiguity. Arabic-written poetry also offers a personalized glimpse of the city, reflecting its distinct cultural appearance and setting it apart from other Arab and African cities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wanni |first=Nada Hussein |date=2005 |title=Reading Khartoum |journal=Politique Africaine |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=302–314 |doi=10.3917/polaf.100.0302 |issn=0244-7827|doi-access=free }}</ref>
