==History==
[[File:HefeiWallMap.jpg|thumb|Old Hefei Map with wall]]
From the 8th to the 6th centuries BC, Hefei was the site of many small states, later a part of the [[Chu (state)|Chu kingdom]]. Many archaeological finds dating from this period have been made. The name 'Hefei' was first given to the county set up in the area under the [[Han dynasty]] in the 2nd century BC.

In the 3rd century AD, the [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford]] was fought at [[Xiaoyao Ford]] ({{lang|zh-hant|逍遙津}}) in Hefei. [[Zhang Liao]], a general of the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] state, led 800 picked cavalry to defeat the 200,000-strong army from Wei's rival state [[Eastern Wu|Wu]]. Several decades of warring in Hefei between Wu and Wei followed this battle.

During the 4th to the 6th centuries AD, this crucial border region between [[Northern and Southern dynasties|northern and southern states]] was much fought over; its name and administrative status were consequently often changed. During the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581–618) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) periods, it became the seat of Lu prefecture—a title it kept until the 15th century, when it became a superior prefecture named Luzhou.

The present city dates from the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1126), the earlier Hefei having been some distance farther north. In the 10th year of [[Emperor Shenzong of Song|Xining]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=熙宁}}, 1077 AD), the taxes collected from the Luchow Prefecture were 50315 Guan, approximately 25 million today's Chinese Yuan, with a ranking of the amount of taxes was the 11th(following Kaifeng, Hangzhou, Qinzhou, Chuzhou, Chengdu, Zizhou, Xingyuan, Mianzhou, Zhenzhou, Suzhou) among all the prefectures of Song Dynasty. During the 10th century, it was for a while the capital of the independent [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu kingdom]] (902–938) and was an important center of the [[Southern Tang]] state (937–975).

After 1127 it became a center of the defenses of the [[Southern Song dynasty]] (1126–1279) against the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] ([[Jurchens|Jurchen]]) invaders in the [[Jin campaigns against the Song dynasty|Jin–Song wars]], as well as a flourishing center of trade between the two states. When the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Chinese Republic]] was founded in 1911, the superior prefecture was abolished, and the city took the name of Hefei. The city was known as '''Luchow''' or '''Liu-tcheou'''<ref>''Inter alia'': Mitchell Sr., S.A. ''A New Universal Atlas Containing Maps of the various Empires, Kingdoms, States and Republics Of The World''. "[http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/China-mitchell-1850 China.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629163858/http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/China-mitchell-1850 |date=2012-06-29 }}" Entered 1850, Published 1853.</ref> ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|{{linktext|庐州}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''Luzhou'') during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (after the 14th century to the 19th century). Hefei was the temporary capital for Anhui from 1853 to 1862. It was renamed as Hefei County in 1912. Following the Chinese victory in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1945, Hefei was made the capital of Anhui.

Before [[World War II]], Hefei remained essentially an administrative center and the regional market for the fertile plain to the south. It was a collecting center for grain, beans, cotton, and [[hemp]], as well as a center for handicraft industries manufacturing cloth, leather, bamboo goods, and ironware.

The construction in 1912 of the [[Tianjin–Pukou railway]], farther east, for a while made Hefei a provincial backwater, and much of its importance passed to [[Bengbu]]. In 1932–36, however, a Chinese company built a railway linking Hefei with [[Yuxikou]] (on the [[Yangtze]] opposite [[Wuhu City|Wuhu]]) to the southeast and with the [[Huai River]] at [[Huainan]] to the north. While this railway was built primarily to exploit the rich [[coal]]field in northern Anhui, it also did much to revive the economy of the Hefei area by taking much of its produce to Wuhu and Nanjing.

Although Hefei was a quiet market town of only about 30,000 in the mid-1930s, its population grew more than tenfold in the following 20 years. The city's administrative role was strengthened by the transfer of the provincial government from [[Anqing]] in 1945, but much of its new growth derived from its development as an industrial city.

Hefei was designated the provincial capital in 1952.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=Hu |first=Richard |title=Reinventing the Chinese City |date=2023 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-21101-7 |location=New York}}</ref>{{Rp|page=122}}

A [[cotton mill]] was opened in 1958, and a thermal generating plant, using coal from Huainan, was established in the early 1950s. It also became the seat of an industry producing [[industrial chemicals]] and chemical [[fertilizer]]s. In the late 1950s an iron and steel complex was built. In addition to a machine-tool works and engineering and agricultural machinery factories, the city has developed an aluminum industry and a variety of light industries.

Hefei's development was advanced by the [[Third Front (China)|Third Front construction]].<ref name=":92">{{Cite book |last1=Marquis |first1=Christopher |url= |title=Mao and Markets: The Communist Roots of Chinese Enterprise |last2=Qiao |first2=Kunyuan |date=2022 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=978-0-300-26883-6 |location=New Haven |doi=10.2307/j.ctv3006z6k |jstor=j.ctv3006z6k |oclc=1348572572 |author-link=Christopher Marquis |s2cid=253067190}}</ref>{{Rp|page=185}} In 1970, the [[University of Science and Technology of China]] relocated to Hefei.<ref name=":02" />{{Rp|pages=125–126}} It is one of the best technological universities in the country.<ref name=":92" />{{Rp|page=185}}

[[File:Entrance A2 of Hefei South Railway South Square Station.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Hefei South Railway South Square Station]]
Hefei Metro is a rapid transit rail network under construction that will eventually serve both urban and rural areas of Hefei. As planned, [[Line 1 (Hefei Metro)|Line 1]] covers a total distance of {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=off}} starting from Hefei Railway Station. It was inaugurated in December 2016.

In February 2013, Metro [[Line 2 (Hefei Metro)|Line 2]] also began its construction. It is being built alongside the Changjiang Dong Road, Changjiang Zhong Road and Changjiang Xi Road, which is a major passenger corridor in the east–west direction. It will pass through the city center area and connect to a transit point where passengers will be able to take the shuttle bus to Hefei Xinqiao International Airport. The Line 2 was opened on 26 December 2017.

In November 2015, Metro [[Line 3 (Hefei Metro)|Line 3]] construction began. Line 3 was opened on 26 December 2019. Line 3 connects the New Station Exploitative-experimental Zone and the Economic Technology Development District, from the vocational education town to the university town. In 2016, Metro [[Line 4 (Hefei Metro)|Line 4]] construction began. Line 4 was opened on 26 December 2021. Line 4 connects the New Station Exploitative-experimental Zone and the High Technology Development District. In 2017, Metro [[Line 5 (Hefei Metro)|Line 5]] construction began. The south part of Line 5 was opened on 26 December 2020. Line 5 connects Binhu New District and the Beicheng (North city) New District.

Yicheng Prison is located within the city. It was built during the 1983 "Strike Hard" campaign and was formerly Hefei Zhenxing Machine Parts Factory. On 15 June 1984, the Prov. Justice Dept. decided to change the name of the Machine Parts Factory's Internal Dept. to the Prov. Independent LRC. On 17 March 1986, the city's Party Committee and government agreed to the change. On 26 April more than 400 inmates were transferred to Hefei Shangzhangwei Farm and Baihu Farm. In February 1992 a secondary country level prison was created at the Shangzhangwei Farm. In August 1992 the Hefei City LRD level was upgraded by the government. June 1996 the prison was changed to its present name. It is currently controlled by Hefei city. It mainly houses prisoners with sentences of less than 5 years and houses up to 1000 prisoners a year. In the past 20 years, nearly 20,000 inmates have completed their sentences here. The prison mainly cultivates vegetables and rice but also cooperates with the Zhejiang Rongguang Group and produces soccer training shoes, soccer balls, tourism products, and other products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laogai.it/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/laogai-handbook.pdf |title=Laogai Handbook 2007–2008 |publisher=Laogao.it |access-date=18 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228232013/http://www.laogai.it/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/laogai-handbook.pdf |archive-date=28 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
