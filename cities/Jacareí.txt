==History==

Jacareí was formed on land that belonged to Mogi das Cruzes. It was founded by Antonio Afonso and his sons in 1652. They built a chapel in honor of Our Lady of Conception. With the help of peaceful Indians, the village prospered. In 1653, was elevated as a town and in 1849, as a city.
Paraibuna (on December 7, 1812), Santa Branca (on February 20, 1841) and São José dos Campos (unknown date) were incorporated into the municipality of Jacareí. They were later dismembered: Sao José do Campos in 1767, Paraibuna in 1832 and Santa Branca in 1856.
With the coffee cycle, the city begins to have paving, new roads and leisure activities, with a small population growth. It was one of the most important cities of the coffee cycle.  At this time (late nineteenth century), industries were beginning to emerge, starting with the socks and the factory "Biscoutos Jacareí" (Jacareí's cookies), taking a leap of development in the twentieth century.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

==Etimology==
  
The origin of the name Jacareí is not known but there are two hypotheses.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jacarei.sp.gov.br/cidade/conheca-jacarei/historia |title=Prefeitura Municipal de Jacarei - História de Jacareí |access-date=2012-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114030545/http://www.jacarei.sp.gov.br/cidade/conheca-jacarei/historia |archive-date=2011-11-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Contains in the archives of the municipality that, in the past, the lakes and the Paraiba do Sul river relied on large numbers of alligators. In a fraternization, held on the river bank near the pond, a component of the group who was having fun next to the river, watching the large number of alligators made an observation: "Jacaré, iih" (''alligator, iih''). It was the simple interjection that, connected to the alligator, resulted in Jacareí.

The second hypothesis is that the word came from a native Brazilian language ([[Tupi language]]) "Icare-ig" that means "river of alligators".
