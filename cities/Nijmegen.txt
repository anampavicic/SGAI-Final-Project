Located on the [[Waal (river)|Waal River]] close to the [[Germany–Netherlands border|German border]], Nijmegen is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands and the first to be recognized as such in Roman times. In 2005, it celebrated 2,000 years of existence.

Nijmegen became a [[free imperial city]] in 1230 and in 1402 a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city. Since 1923 it has been a university city with the opening of a Catholic institution now known as the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]. The city is well known for the annual [[International Four Days Marches Nijmegen]] event.

Its population as of 2024 was 187,011.<ref name=pop/>

== Population centres ==
The municipality is formed by the city of Nijmegen, incorporating the former villages of [[Hatert]], Hees and Neerbosch, as well as the urban expansion projects in [[Veur-Lent]], Nijmegen-Oosterhout and [[Ressen, Nijmegen|Nijmegen–Ressen]], all situated north of the [[Waal (river)|river Waal]].

=== Proximity of border with Germany ===
The city lies a few kilometers from the border with Germany, and to some extent the westernmost villages in the municipality of [[Kranenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia|Kranenburg]], Germany, function as [[commuter town|dormitories]] for people who work in the Dutch city of Nijmegen in part due to the immigration of Dutch people from the region who were attracted by the lower house pricing just across the border.

The German city of [[Duisburg]] (in the [[Ruhr]] region) is about {{convert|78|km|1|abbr=on}} away, while the German town of [[Kleve]] (in the [[Lower Rhine region]]) is about {{convert|20|km|1|abbr=on}} away.

=== Antiquity ===
The first mention of Nijmegen in history is in the first century BCE, when the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] built a military camp on the place where Nijmegen was to appear; the location had great strategic value because of the surrounding hills, which give a good view over the river Waal and [[Rhine]] valley.

By 69, when the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], the original inhabitants of the [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse]] (''Maas'') delta, [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolted]], a village called ''[[Oppidum]] Batavorum'' had formed near the Roman camp. This village was destroyed in the revolt, but when it had ended the Romans built another, bigger camp where the [[Legio X Gemina|Legio X ''Gemina'']] was stationed. Soon after, another village formed around this camp.

In 98, Nijmegen was the first of two settlements in what is now the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] to receive [[municipium|Roman city rights]].

In 103, the X ''Gemina'' was restationed in [[Vindobona]], now [[Vienna]], which may have been a major blow to the economy of the village around the camp, losing around 5000 inhabitants. In 104 Emperor [[Trajan]] renamed the town, which became known as ''Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum'', Noviomagus for short, the ultimate origin of the current name.

A collection of artifacts from Roman antiquity were compiled by [[Johannes Smetius]] in the 17th century, called the [[Smetius Collection]].<ref>Nellissen, L. (translator), ''Nijmeegse Oudheden'', Stichting Stilus, {{ISBN|90-808719-1-5}}.</ref>

In January 2022, archeologists led by Pepijn van de Geer announced the discovery of an intact 2,000-year-old blue glass bowl with a vertical stripe pattern in Nijmegen. Researchers assume that this well-preserved bowl was made in a glass workshop. According to van de Geer, this type of bowl was made by allowing molten glass to cool and harden over a mold.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=McGreevy|first=Nora|magazine=Smithsonian|title=2,000-Year-Old Roman Bowl Discovered Intact in the Netherlands|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/2000-year-old-ancient-roman-glass-bowl-found-in-netherlands-180979461/|access-date=2022-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Nijtmans |first=Anne |date=2022-01-20 |title=Archeologen vinden bijna 2000 jaar oude puntgave schaal in Nijmegen: 'Topstuk met museale waarde' |language=nl |work=[[De Gelderlander]] |url=https://www.gelderlander.nl/nijmegen/archeologen-vinden-bijna-2000-jaar-oude-puntgave-schaal-in-nijmegen-topstuk-met-museale-waarde~a7b2f01f/ |access-date=2023-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Aton|first=Francesca|date=2022-01-25|title=Perfectly Preserved 2,000-Year-Old Roman Glass Bowl Unearthed in the Netherlands|url=https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/roman-glass-bowl-nijmegen-1234616630/|access-date=2022-02-20|website=ARTnews.com|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Liu|first=Jasmine|date=2022-01-24|title=2,000-Year-Old Roman Glass Bowl Unearthed "Like New"|url=http://hyperallergic.com/707260/2000-year-old-roman-glass-bowl-unearthed-like-new/|access-date=2022-02-20|website=Hyperallergic|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
Beginning in the latter half of the 4th century, Roman power decreased and Noviomagus eventually became part of [[Francia]]. It also appeared around this time on the {{Lang|la|[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]}}. In the 8th century Emperor [[Charlemagne]] maintained his ''palatium'' in Nijmegen in 777,<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015055306438?urlappend=%3Bseq=35 |title=Oorkondenboek der Graafschappen Gelre en Zutfen tot op den Slag van Woeringen, 5 Juni 1288|last=Baron Sloet|first=L. A. J. W.|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1872|location=s'Gravenhage|pages=13 (no. 11)|hdl=2027/mdp.39015055306438?urlappend=%3Bseq=35}}</ref> and possibly on at least three more occasions. During his brief deposition of 830, the emperor [[Louis the Pious]] was sent to Nijmegen by his son, [[Lothair I]]. Thanks to the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], trade flourished.

[[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], was born at Nijmegen in 1165. In 1230 his son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] granted Nijmegen [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]]. In 1247, the city was ceded to the count of [[Guelders]] as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for a loan. The loan was never repaid, and Nijmegen has been a part of Gelderland ever since. This did not hamper trade; Nijmegen even became part of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1364.

The arts also flourished in this period. Famous medieval painters like the [[Limbourg brothers]] were born and educated in Nijmegen. Some of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ancestors also came from the city.<ref>Hieronymus Bosch. Complete Works, published by Taschen.</ref>

=== Early modern period ===
During the [[Dutch Revolt]], trade came to a halt and even though Nijmegen became a part of the Republic of United Provinces after its [[Siege of Nijmegen (1591)|capture from the Spanish in 1591]], it remained a [[border town]] and had to endure multiple sieges. [[File:View on the waal janvangoyen.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Waal river near Nijmegen, 1641]]
[[File:Nijmegen - Stadhuis en Grote Markt 1900.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Nijmegen town hall (left) around 1900]]
In 1678 Nijmegen was host to the negotiations between the European powers that aimed to put an end to the constant warfare that had ravaged the continent for years. The result was the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]] that failed to provide for a lasting peace.

In 1702, at the start of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the French nearly took Nijmegen by surprise. Only because of the intervention of an Anglo-Dutch army under the [[Godert de Ginkel, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]] and the bravery of the citizens of Nijmegen was the [[Assault on Nijmegen (1702)|Assault on Nijmegen]] repulsed.

In the second half of the 19th century, the fortifications around the city became a major problem. There were too many inhabitants inside the walls, but the fortifications could not be demolished because Nijmegen was deemed as being of vital importance to the defence of the Netherlands. When events in the [[Franco-Prussian war]] proved that old-fashioned fortifications were no longer of use, this policy was changed and the fortifications were dismantled in 1874. The old castle had already been demolished in 1797, so that its bricks could be sold.

Through the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, Nijmegen grew steadily. In 1923 the current [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] was founded and in 1927 a channel was dug between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and [[Meuse]] (''Maas'') rivers.

The Waal was bridged in 1878 by a [[Nijmegen railway bridge|rail bridge]] and in 1936 by a [[Waalbrug|road bridge]], which was claimed to be Europe's biggest bridge at the time. In November 2013 a second road bridge ({{langx|nl|[[De Oversteek]]}}), 2 km downstream, was opened to ease congestion.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 2013 |title=Tweede verkeersbrug bij Nijmegen |url=https://www.absolutefacts.nl/gelderland/nijmegen/oversteek-nijmegen.htm | access-date=5 January 2024|website=Absolutefacts.nl |language=nl}}</ref>

=== World War II ===
In 1940, [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands was invaded]] by Germany, with Nijmegen being the first Dutch city to fall into German hands. On 22 February 1944, [[Bombing of Nijmegen|Nijmegen was heavily bombed]] by American planes, causing great damage to the city centre. It was subsequently claimed by the Allies that the American pilots thought they were bombing the German city of [[Kleve]], while the Germans alleged that it was a planned operation authorised by the Dutch government in exile. The Dutch organization for investigating wartime atrocities, the [[NIOD]], announced in January 2005 that its study of the incident confirmed that it was an accident caused by poor communications and chaos in the airspace. Over 750 people died in the bombardment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.godutch.com/newspaper/index.php?id=684|title = U.S. Air Force deadly 1944 bombing of Nijmegen accidental » the Windmill news articles » goDutch}}</ref>

During September 1944, the city saw heavy fighting during [[Operation Market Garden]]. The objective of the [[Battle of Nijmegen]] was mainly to prevent the Germans from destroying the bridges. Capturing the road bridge allowed the British Army [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] to attempt to reach the [[1st British Airborne Division]] in [[Arnhem]]. The bridge was heavily defended by over 300 German troops on both the north and south sides with close to 20 [[anti-tank guns]] and two [[anti-aircraft guns]], supported with artillery. The Germans' late attempt to blow the road bridge was possibly foiled by a local Dutch resistance hero, [[Jan van Hoof]], who is said to have cut the wires to the bridge. The Germans made repeated attacks on the bridge using bombs attached to driftwood, midget submarines and later resorted to shelling the bridge with [[88mm]] barrages. Troops {{Clarify | post-text = German or Allied? | date = September 2019}} were positioned on the bridge giving an excellent arc of fire in case of attack. Troops that could not fit onto the bridge were positioned in a bombed-out house slightly upstream of the bridge. During the shelling, the house was hit, killing six soldiers and wounding one. Nijmegen was liberated from German occupation by the British [[Grenadier Guards]] of the [[Guards Armoured Division]], as well as elements of the American [[82nd Airborne Division]] in September 1944. The city was later used as a springboard for [[Operation Veritable]], the invasion across the Rhine River by Allied Troops.

=== Post-war period ===
From 1946 to 1948 [[Mariënbosch concentration camp]], near Nijmegen, was used to house German nationals who were to be deported from the Netherlands.

On 23 February 1981, the Nijmegen police department and the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch Army]] stormed the [[Piersonstraat riots|Piersonstraat]] and Zeigelhof, a squatted housing block in the city centre of Nijmegen. Using 200 riot vans, three [[Leopard 1]]s, three [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, a helicopter, 1,200 policemen, and 750 members of the armed forces, they evicted the squatters and demolished the block, while clouding the entire area in teargas and [[CS gas]]. This received enormous backlash in local politics. While the city government wanted the squatters out to build a parking garage, most of the population wanted affordable housing to be built in the area.

The [[city council]] was largely dominated by left-wing and progressive parties such as the [[GroenLinks|Green Party]], [[Democrats 66]], [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]], and [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour]]. At times Nijmegen has been the only major city in the Netherlands with a solely left-wing government, and received the nickname '[[Havana]] on the Waal'.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eupedia.com/netherlands/nijmegen.shtml|title = Eupedia}}</ref>

Nijmegen celebrated its 2000th year of existence in 2005. It is considered the oldest city in the Netherlands. In gaining this qualification, it has competed with the city of [[Maastricht]].

In November 2005, the city centre of Nijmegen was the site of the assassination of political activist [[Louis Sévèke]] by a former activist, Marcel Teunissen, who was arrested in 2007 in Spain and extradited to the Netherlands. Teunissen has also been accused of bank robbery. He committed his acts out of revenge for a forcible eviction from the squatter scene by Louis Sévèke.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Nijmegen has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''). It is one of the warmest cities of the Netherlands, especially during summer, when the highest temperatures in the country are usually measured in the triangle Roermond–Nijmegen–Eindhoven. The lack of north–south oriented mountain ranges in Europe make this area prone to sudden shifts in weather, giving the region a semi-continental climate.

Some of the northernmost wineries in the world are found just outside Nijmegen, around [[Groesbeek]], a suburban village south-east of Nijmegen.

During the [[2006 European heat wave]], closest official weather station Volkel reached a high of {{convert|36.7|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 19 July. The heat wave coincided with that year's Four Day Marches, which were cancelled after the first day, when two people died of [[hyperthermia]]-related causes. Temperatures on that day, 18 July, reached around {{convert|36|°C|1|abbr=on}} in the city.

=== Historical remains ===
Few Roman remains are visible today; a fragment of the old city wall can be seen near the [[casino]] and the foundations of the [[amphitheatre]] are traced in the paving of the present-day Rembrandtstraat. The [[Valkhof Museum]], on the Valkhof, has a permanent display of the history of Nijmegen, including artifacts from the Roman era.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Collectie Museum Het Valkhof Nijmegen |url=https://www.museumhetvalkhof.nl/zien-en-doen/collectie/ |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.museumhetvalkhof.nl}}</ref> Additionally, they usually have temporary exhibitions of more and less famous artists. During building works in the Waalsprong area, ruins from before the Roman times were found which were identified in 2022 as those of a sauna. This 3,600 year-old sauna is the first of its kind in mainland Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |title=3,600-year-old sauna found in Nijmegen; Unique on mainland Europe |url=https://nltimes.nl/2022/09/28/3600-year-old-sauna-found-nijmegen-unique-mainland-europe |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=NL Times |language=en}}</ref>

Not many very old buildings are left in town: first the Americans bombed it in February 1944, later the Germans shelled it for about five months after the liberation in September 1944, and finally there were a number of vigorous city planners in the 1950s, 60s and 70s who finished the demolition. There are still a few noteworthy sights, however. Valkhof hill downtown features a Carolingian chapel (eighth, ninth century AD) and a small remainder of an imperial castle that was demolished in 1798. The 750-year old Stevenskerk had to be reconstructed after WWII.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Icon fullof stories {{!}} Stevenskerk Nijmegen |url=https://www.stevenskerk.nl/en |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.stevenskerk.nl |language=nl-nl}}</ref>

=== Religion ===
[[File:Grote of Sint-Stevenskerk.jpg|thumb|Grote of Sint-Stevenskerk Church Nijmegen]]
In 1968, theologians in the Catholic Church issued what is now known as the [[Nijmegen Statement]], demanding sweeping reforms in the Vatican's Holy Office, previously known as The Inquisition, and calling for greater scope for theological inquiry. Among its signatories was theologian Fr. [[Joseph Ratzinger]], then a member of the faculty at the [[University of Tübingen]], but later the head of the successor to the [[Holy Office]], the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], and later still [[Pope Benedict XVI]].

The Nijmegen Statement said: "Any form of Inquisition however subtle, not only harms the development of sound theology, it also causes irreparable damage to the credibility of the church". The signatories, a group of predominantly German-speaking theologians asserted that "the freedom of theologians, and theology in the service of the church, regained by [[Vatican II]], must not be jeopardised again." The signatories pledged their loyalty to the Pope, but argued that the teaching office of pope and bishops "cannot and must not supersede, hamper and impede the teaching task of theologians as scholars."

=== Sport ===
[[File:Goffertstadion N.E.C. Nijmegen.jpg|thumb|Goffertstadion NEC Nijmegen]]

Sport in the city is principally focused on its football club [[NEC Nijmegen]] or just NEC, short for Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie, which plays at the 12,500-seat [[Stadion de Goffert]]. The club plays in the [[Eredivisie]]. Another football club is [[Jonker Boys]].

[[Bandy Vereniging Nijmegen]] is the biggest [[bandy]] club in the country. [[Netherlands national bandy team|The national team]] got celebrated by over a hundred fans and Mayor Hubert Bruls after winning Division B of the [[2018 Bandy World Championship]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=https://www.omroepgelderland.nl/nieuws/2304761/Toeters-en-confetti-voor-kampioensteam-bandy|title = Google Translate| date=5 February 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://bandynijmegen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/huldiging-Triavium.jpeg| title = Image from the celebration}}</ref>

The city is also home to one of the country's oldest [[cricket]] clubs, [[Quick 1888]], a current member of the [[Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond|KNCB]]. Formed in 1888, it is the largest cricket club in the east of the country and was formed 13 years after the first club, Utile Dulci from [[Deventer]]. The cricket club has two men's teams. The city also has the [[Nijmegen Devils]], an [[Ice hockey]] club. Nijmegen also plays host to the annual [[Zevenheuvelenloop]] (''Seven Hills Run''), an annual {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} run recognised by the [[IAAF]] as a Bronze Label race.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Economy ===
The three main employers<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nijmegen|url=https://urbact.eu/nijmegen|website=Urbact|date=3 December 2014}}</ref> in Nijmegen are:

1. [[Radboud University]];

2. The three hospitals in the city: [[Radboud University Medical Center]], [[:nl:Sint Maartenskliniek|Sint Maartenskliniek]], and [[:nl:Canisius-Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis|Canisius-Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis]] (CWZ);

3. The semiconductor industry. [[Nexperia]] and [[Ampleon]] (both spun off from [[NXP Semiconductors]]) are headquartered in the city. Multinational companies such as [[Qualcomm]], [[Photronics Inc]], and [[Applied Materials]] also have facilities in Nijmegen.

Other notable companies headquartered in Nijmegen include [[Synthon (company)|Synthon]], a Dutch multinational pharmaceutical company and [[Vaxxinova]], an [[:de:EW Group|EW group]] subsidiary which produces animal vaccines.

=== More room for the river Waal ===
To prevent flooding in the near future, the Dutch government is changing the course of more than 30 rivers throughout the country. These measures, taken along the rivers IJssel, Lek, Maas and Waal, are known as ‘Room for the River’. Room for the river Waal as it passes Nijmegen is one of these measures. As part of this, the artificial island [[Veur-Lent]] was created in 2015.

The river Waal not only has a sharp bend near Nijmegen, it also forms a bottleneck. In 1993 and 1995, this led to high water and floods. To prevent this from happening again, and to protect inhabitants of the city and its surroundings against the water, work has been done to relocate the Waal dike in Lent and to excavate a large ancillary channel in the flood plains, creating an island in the Waal opposite Nijmegen. The large-scale project involved the construction of three bridges, new dikes and concrete water barriers. The island contains an urban river park with possibilities for recreation, culture, water and nature.
[[File:Nijmegen Centraal Station.jpg|thumb|Nijmegen Central Station]]

=== Transport ===
Nijmegen has five railway stations: [[Nijmegen railway station|Nijmegen]], [[Nijmegen Dukenburg railway station|Nijmegen Dukenburg]], [[Nijmegen Heyendaal railway station|Nijmegen Heyendaal]], [[Nijmegen Lent railway station|Nijmegen Lent]] and [[Nijmegen Goffert railway station|Nijmegen Goffert]]. The central station is connected to the national Intercity network. The bus company [[Breng]] operates the city buses in the Arnhem-Nijmegen metropolitan area.
[[File:Het Keizer Karelplein, met op de achtergrond de Stadsschouwburg Nijmegen.jpg|thumb|Keizer Karelplein]]
Like most Dutch cities, bicycles are an important mode of transport. The city is connected to Arnhem, {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north, by a "fietssnelweg" (fast cycle highway) which crosses the Snelbinder bridge in the city. During 2010–2012 the cycle highway received upgrades to further encourage the use of bicycles for transport between Nijmegen and Arnhem.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hembrow |first=David |url=http://hembrow.blogspot.com/2010/10/mobility-man-cycle-superhighway.html |title=A view from the cycle path: Mobility man – cycle superhighway |publisher=Hembrow.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-04 |access-date=2013-03-26}}</ref> In May 2016, the Dutch [[Fietsersbond]] (Cyclists' Union) awarded the 2016 [[Cycling in the Netherlands#The Fietsstad (Bicycle city) awards|Fietsstad]] (Cycling City) award to the city of Nijmegen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gemeente Nijmegen uitgeroepen tot Fietsstad 2016|url=http://www.fietsersbond.nl/nieuws/gemeente-nijmegen-uitgeroepen-tot-fietsstad-2016|publisher=[[Fietsersbond]]|access-date=19 May 2016|language=NL|date=19 May 2016}}</ref>

[[Kaizer Karelplein (Nijmegen)|Kaizer Karelplein]] ([[English (language)|English]] ''The Plaza of Emperor [[Charlemagne]]''), a roundabout in the center of the city with seven busy connecting or almost connecting roads, is one of the most accident-prone roads in the Netherlands, and Nijmegen has an extensive, overcrowded road network that splits up the city in separate parts instead of having the busy roads out-of-center away from densely populated areas as is the norm in the rest of the country. The roundabout surrounds a park which is not used because it would be life-threatening to attempt to cross the road of the roundabout to get to and from the park. There is also a [[Kaizer Karelplein (Maastricht)|Kaizer Karelplein]] in Maastricht.

The river is a busy freight transport route, with barges passing through on the way between the industrial regions of Germany and the docks at Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Hook of Holland. The [[Maas–Waal Canal]] also carries freight through the city.

== Education ==
[[File:Erasmusgebouw Erasmusplein 1 Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen gezien vanaf Heyendaalseweg.jpg|thumb|[[Radboud University Nijmegen]]]]
Nijmegen is host to [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]. Founded in 1923 as the first [[Catholicism|Catholic]] university in the Netherlands, it used to be called ''Catholic University of Nijmegen'' until 2004, when it took its current name. {{As of|2018|October|df=}}, it had 22,142 students and 4,921 staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ru.nl/english/about-us/our-university-0/facts-figures/|title=Facts & Figures|date=May 30, 2019|website=Radboud University|access-date=May 30, 2019|archive-date=May 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530063242/https://www.ru.nl/english/about-us/our-university-0/facts-figures/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Radboud University runs the High Field Magnetic Laboratory which is able to achieve some of the highest fields available in Europe at 38 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]] (continuous). The facility is available to outside users, primarily for research purposes.

The education and social work departments of the [[HAN University of Applied Sciences]], school for higher-level vocational training are also located in Nijmegen, as are that school's medical departments.

In addition to these institutions, there is also an intermediate-level vocational school and a number of secondary schools: Groenschool Nijmegen, Kandinsky College, Nijmeegse Scholengemeenschap Groenewoud (NSG), Citadel College, Stedelijke Scholengemeenschap Nijmegen (SSGN), Canisius College, St. Jorisschool, Mondial College, the Stedelijk Gymnasium (formally the "Latijnse school", founded in the 16th century), the Karel de Grote College, Montessori College and the Dominicus College. Of note is also [[Leefwerkschool Eigenwijs]], which caters to students from all over the Netherlands who have been repeatedly expelled from "regular" high schools. Leefwerkschool Eigenwijs has its roots in the local activist movement of the early 1980s and is the only school of its kind recognised in the Netherlands.

Nijmegen is also an important centre of [[Psycholinguistics]], home to the [[Max Planck Institute]] of Psycholinguistics and the [[F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging]].

The Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 was awarded to [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] while at Radboud University "for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material [[graphene]]."
