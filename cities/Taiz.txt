It is located in the Yemeni highlands, near the port city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] on the [[Red Sea]], at an elevation of about {{convert|1,400|m}} above sea level.

As of 2023, the city has an estimated population of approximately 940,600 residents making it the third largest city in Yemen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Taiz Population 2023 |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/taiz-population |access-date=2023-08-14 |website=worldpopulationreview.com |archive-date=2023-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230814103104/https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/taiz-population |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Cairo Castle GardenTaiz,Yemen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Al-Qahira Castle]]'s garden]]

===Medieval===

The first reference to Taiz in historical sources dates back to the first half of the 12th century CE, when the sultan of the [[Sulayhid dynasty]], Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi, built the [[Al-Qahira Castle]].<ref name="wmf">{{cite web |title=Old City of Ta'izz |url=https://www.wmf.org/project/old-city-taizz |website=World Monuments Fund |access-date=January 15, 2023}}</ref> Taiz first became an urbanized area during the days of his brother Ali bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi.

The next historical reference to Taiz mentioned that Queen [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]]'s minister, Prince Al-Mansur bin Al-Mufaddal bin Abi Al-Barakat, sold many of the country's castles and cities - except for the fortresses of Taiz and Sabr - to the ruler of Aden Al-Zari'i, the preacher Muhammad Ibn Saba, in exchange for one hundred thousand dinars.

[[Turan-Shah]], the older brother of [[Saladin]], ruled the city after he conquered Yemen in 1173 CE.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYRtAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|title=A History of Egypt: Volume 6, In the Middle Ages|last=Lane-Poole|first=Stanley|date=2013-10-03|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108065696|pages=197|language=en|access-date=2020-09-26|archive-date=2024-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240814050344/https://books.google.com/books?id=VYRtAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> Turan-Shah built the citadel on the hill overlooking the old city.<ref>Steven C. Caton: ''Yemen''. ABC-CLIO, 2013, p.52</ref> In 1175 CE, Taiz was made the capital of Yemen as it was incorporated into dominions of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] by Turan-Shah.

Taiz's expansion accelerated when the Rasulid dynasty, which ruled Yemen from 1229 to 1454, took over the city. The second [[Rasulid]] King, Almaddhafar (1288 CE), moved his kingdom's capital from Sanaa to Taiz, due to its proximity to Aden.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2QjCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT305|title=Yemen: The Unknown Arabia|last=Mackintosh-Smith|first=Tim|date=2014-06-03|publisher=The Overlook Press|isbn=9781468309980|pages=305|language=en|access-date=2020-09-26|archive-date=2024-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240814050335/https://books.google.com/books?id=m2QjCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT305|url-status=live}}</ref>  Taiz was said to have reached its golden age during the Rasulid dynasty, whose sultans spent lavishly on palaces, mosques, and madrassas.<ref name="wmf" /> Its neighborhoods also teemed with schools, guesthouses, markets, orchards, and lush gardens, and the city was considered to be a center for the study of the [[Shafi'i school]] of Islamic jurisprudence.

In 1332 [[Ibn Battutah]] visited Taiz and described it as one of the largest and most beautiful cities of Yemen:<ref>{{Cite book |title=First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]] |page=626 |isbn=9-0040-9796-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ro--tXw_hxMC&pg=PA626 |year=1993 |language=en |access-date=2020-09-26 |archive-date=2024-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240814050338/https://books.google.com/books?id=ro--tXw_hxMC&pg=PA626#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>
<blockquote>
We went on ... to the town of Taʻizz, the capital of the king of Yemen, and one of the finest and largest towns in that country. Its people are overbearing, insolent, and rude, as is generally the case in towns where kings reside. Taʻizz is made up of three quarters; the first is the residence of the king and his court, the second, called ʽUdayna, is the military station, and the third, called al-Mahálib, is inhabited by the commonalty, and contains the principal market.<ref>[[H.A.R. Gibb]], translator, ''Ibn Battúta: Travels in Asia and Africa, 1325-1354'', London, 1929, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKqn_CWTxYEC&q=ta%27izz p. 108-109] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240814050338/https://books.google.com/books?id=zKqn_CWTxYEC&q=ta%27izz#v=snippet&q=ta'izz&f=false |date=2024-08-14 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1500, the capital was moved to [[Sana'a]] by the ruler of the [[Tahirids (Yemen)|Taharid dynasty]]. In 1516 Taiz came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control.

=== 1994 mass shooting ===
On March 25–26, 1994, a mass shooting took place in the city. A Yemeni killed eleven women and seven men, among them his [[Uxoricide|wife]] and his [[Matricide|mother]], before he was arrested by police. When he was led away he managed to wrest the gun from a police officer and kill another four people, [[Shootout|three of them police officers, before he himself was shot dead.]] A total of 23 people were killed, including the suspect.<ref>{{Citation |last=Künzi |first=Hans P. |title=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |date=2001 |work=Verleger • Humanist Homme de Lettres |pages=61–62 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-38087-1_13 |access-date=2024-06-25 |place=Berlin, Heidelberg |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-38087-1_13 |isbn=978-3-662-37346-0 |archive-date=2024-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240814050342/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-38087-1_13 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===20th century===
In 1918 the Ottomans lost Taiz to the newly independent [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]].

Taiz remained a walled city until 1948, when [[Ahmad bin Yahya|Imam Ahmed]] made it the second capital of Yemen, allowing for expansion beyond its fortified wall.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uYpAQAAMAAJ&q=rasulid+ta%27izz+OR+taiz|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: TAHRIR-TARDJAMA|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|date=1998|publisher=Brill|pages=118|language=en|access-date=2024-08-14|archive-date=2024-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240814050832/https://books.google.com/books?id=4uYpAQAAMAAJ&q=rasulid+ta%27izz+OR+taiz|url-status=live}}</ref> In the 1960s, the first purified water system in Yemen was opened in Taiz. In 1962, state administrations moved back to Sana'a.

===Yemeni uprising and war===
{{further|Siege of Taiz}}
During the [[Yemeni Revolution]] [[Battle of Taiz (2011)|fighting]] in Taiz resulted in anti-government forces seizing control of the city from president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]].

As part of the [[Yemeni Civil War (2014–present)|2015 Yemeni Civil War]], on 22 March 2015, the [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took the city in the [[Aftermath of the 2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|aftermath]] of their [[2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|coup d'état]] in [[Sanaa]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/world/middleeast/houthi-rebels-taiz-yemen.html?_r=0|agency=The New York Times|title=Rebels Seize Key Parts of Yemen's Third-Largest City, Taiz|date=22 March 2015|access-date=22 March 2015|archive-date=25 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325003252/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/world/middleeast/houthi-rebels-taiz-yemen.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref> The city became the site of [[Battle of Taiz (2015–2016)|a military confrontation]] between [[Houthis]] and the forces loyal to [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi]].
