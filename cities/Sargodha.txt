===Traditional food and drink===

The cuisine of Sargodha is similar to that of other regions of South Asia, with some of it originating from the royal kitchens of 16th-century Mughal emperors.<ref name="Goodwin2002">{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=William|title=Pakistan|year=2002|publisher=Lucent Books|language=en|isbn=978-1-59018-218-5|page=79|quote=Pakistani food is similar to that of northern India, with a splash of Middle Eastern influence derived from other Muslim cultures over the centuries.}}</ref> Most of those dishes have their roots in [[British cuisine|British]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]].<ref name="LeeNadeau2011">{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Jonathan H.X.|last2=Nadeau|first2=Kathleen M.|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=en|isbn=978-0-313-35066-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofas00leej/page/973 973]|quote=Pakistani cuisine—a fusion of Central Asian, Middle Eastern, Persian, and Indian traditions—is known for being spicy and for its aromatic and flavorful richness.|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofas00leej/page/973}}</ref> Pakistani cooking uses large quantities of spices, herbs, and seasoning.
