'''Round Rock''' is a city in the U.S. state of [[Texas]], in [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]] (with a small part in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_12420.htm|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics for Austin-Round Rock, Texas, Metropolitan Area}}</ref> which is a part of the [[Greater Austin]] metropolitan area. Its population is 119,468 according to the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US4863500|title=Census - Geography Profile: Round Rock city, Texas|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=February 27, 2022}}</ref>

The city straddles the [[Balcones Escarpment]],<ref name="Balcones Escarpment">{{Handbook of Texas|name=Balcones Escarpment|id=rxb01|retrieved=May 11, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association</ref> a fault line in which the areas roughly east of [[Interstate 35]] are flat and characterized by having black, fertile soils of the [[Texas blackland prairies|Blackland Prairie]], and the west side of the Escarpment, which consists mostly of hilly, [[Karst topography|karst-like]] terrain with little topsoil and higher elevations and which is part of the [[Texas Hill Country]]. Located about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of downtown [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Round Rock shares a common border with [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] at [[Texas State Highway 45]].

In August 2008, ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' named Round Rock as the seventh-best American small city in which to live.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2008/snapshots/PL4863500.html|title=Best places to live 2008 – Top 100 City details: Round Rock, Texas|journal=Money Magazine|publisher=Money.cnn.com|access-date=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  Round Rock was the only Texas city to make the Top 10.

==History==

===Prehistory===

Round Rock and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9,200 BCE. The area's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late [[Pleistocene]] (Ice Age), and are linked to the [[Clovis culture]] around 9,200 BCE based on evidence found at the much-studied [[Gault (archaeological site)|Gault Site]], midway between [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]] and [[Fort Cavazos]].<ref name="tshaonline1">{{cite web |title=''Handbook of Texas Online'': "Gault Site" |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bbgya |publisher=Texas State History Association |access-date=July 18, 2010}}</ref> One of the most important discoveries in recent times is the ancient skeletal remains dubbed "the [[Leanderthal Lady]]" because of its age and proximity to [[Leander, Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Round Rock Texas|last1=Thompson|first1=Karen R.|last2=Digesualado|first2=Jane H.|publisher=Nortex Press (Eakin Publications)|year=1985|location=Austin, Texas|pages=4, 7}}</ref> The site is {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} west of Round Rock and was discovered by accident by [[Texas Department of Transportation]] workers while drilling core samples for a new highway. The site has been studied for many years and samples carbon date to this particular [[Pleistocene]] period around 10,500 years ago.

Prehistoric and [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] "open occupation" campsites are also found throughout the county along streams and other water sources, including [[Brushy Creek (San Gabriel River tributary)|Brushy Creek]] in Round Rock and the [[San Gabriel River (Texas)|San Gabriel River]] in Georgetown, {{convert|10|mi|0|abbr=on}} north.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bfp02|title=Prehistory|last=Hester|first=Thomas R.|author2=Ellen Sue Turner |access-date=August 10, 2010}}</ref> These archeology dig sites show a much greater volume United States evidence of Archaic period inhabitants based on relics and flint tools recovered from [[Fire-cracked rock|burned rock]] [[midden]]s.
The earliest known "historical" Native American occupants, the [[Tonkawa]], were a flint-working, hunting people who followed the [[Plains bison|buffalo]] on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to aid them in their hunts.

===Post-Archaic Native American history===

During the 18th century, the Tonkawa made the transition to a horse culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Apparently, small numbers of [[Kiowa]], [[Yojuane]], [[Tawakoni]], and [[Mayeye]] Native-Americans lived in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.<ref name="tshaonline2">{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hcw11|title=Williamson County|last=Odintz|first=Mark|access-date=August 10, 2010}}</ref> After they were crowded out by white settlement, the [[Comanches]] raided settlements in the county until the 1860s. In the late 19th century, Native Americans were being pushed out of Central Texas.

As the area developed into a rural Anglo community, some of the modern paved roads followed the original Native-American pathways. One famous immigration route passed through Round Rock and is called the "Double File Trail" because the path was wide enough for two horsemen to ride side-by-side. It is part of a longer trail from North Texas that crossed the San Gabriel River in Georgetown, Brushy Creek in Round Rock, and the Colorado River in Austin.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical Round Rock Texas|last=Thompson|first=Karen R.|author2=Jane H. Digesualado |year=1985|publisher=Nortex Press (Eakin Publications) |location=Austin, Texas |oclc=12119831|pages=16, 17}}</ref> An elementary school in the Round Rock school district is named for the trail, Double File Trail Elementary School.

===19th-century history===

[[File:The Round Rock of Round Rock Texas.jpg|thumb|The "round rock" of Round Rock, Texas, in Brushy Creek along the historic [[Chisholm Trail]]]]
In 1851, a small community was formed on the banks of Brushy Creek, near a large round and anvil-shaped rock in the middle of the creek. {{smaller|(  {{coord|30|30|47.14|N|97|41|21.62|W}})}} This round rock marked a convenient low-water crossing for wagons, horses, and cattle. The first postmaster called the community "Brushy", and the creek was called "[[Brushy Creek, Williamson County, Texas|Brushy Creek]]", but in 1854, at the suggestion of the postmaster, the small settlement was renamed Round Rock in honor of this now famous rock.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://texashistoricalmarkers.weebly.com/the-round-rock.html|title=The Round Rock|publisher= Texas Historical Markers|access-date=August 31, 2023}}</ref> After the Civil War, [[Jesse Chisholm]] began moving cattle from South Texas through Round Rock on the way to [[Abilene, Kansas]]. The route he established, which crossed Brushy Creek at the round rock, became known as the [[Chisholm Trail]].<ref name="About Round Rock">{{cite web |url=http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/about/|title=City of Round Rock profile|publisher= Roundrocktexas.gov|access-date=July 23, 2010}}</ref> Most of the old buildings, including the old Saint Charles Hotel, have been preserved. This historic area is now called "Old Town".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=952|title=A Brief History of Round Rock|publisher=Roundrocktexas.gov|access-date=March 19, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419001235/http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=952|archive-date=April 19, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Palm House Museum, Round Rock, TX IMG 4063.JPG|thumb|right|The Palm House Museum in Round Rock]]
Downtown Round Rock was the site of a historic gunfight and subsequent capture (and death) of the 19th-century American train robber [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbaab|title=Bass, Sam Handbook of Texas entry}}</ref> by the Texas Ranger Division on July 19, 1878. The Rangers followed Bass and his gang after they robbed the [[Fort Worth]]-to-Cleburne train. Bass was tracked to Round Rock, and as he attempted to flee, Bass was shot and killed in a gun battle by Ranger George Herold and Ranger Sergeant Richard Ware. Sheriff's Deputy A.W. Grimes was killed in the shootout. Near Ware was [[Soapy Smith]], a noted con man, and his cousin Edwin, who witnessed Ware's shot. Soapy exclaimed, "I think you got him."<ref>Smith, Jeff (2009). ''Alias Soapy Smith: The Life and Death of a Scoundrel'', Klondike Research. pp.&nbsp;30–32. {{ISBN|0-9819743-0-9}}</ref> The event is known locally as the "Sam Bass Shootout".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/5768-deputy-sheriff-alijah-w.-(caige)-grimes|title=The Officer Down Memorial Page on A. W. Grimes}}</ref> This shootout is recreated each year at the July 4 Frontier Days Celebration in Old Settlers Park. Bass is buried in [[Round Rock Cemetery]], northwest of "Old Town" on Sam Bass Road. His original headstone can be found on display at the [[Round Rock Public Library]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=953 |title=City of Round Rock – Sam Bass |publisher=Roundrocktexas.gov |access-date=March 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529030654/http://www.roundrocktexas.gov///home/index.asp?page=953 |archive-date=May 29, 2010 }}</ref>

===20th-century history===

====Cotton====

In the first half of the 20th century, the county's wealth came from the cotton fields.<ref>{{cite book |title=Road, River and Good Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb |last=Scarbrough |first=Linda |year=2009 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-87611-202-1|page=22 }}</ref> [[Cotton]], row crops, grapes, and truck farming were the predominant subsistence east of Interstate 35. West of the Balcones divide, ranchers raised cattle, sheep, and to a lesser extent, goats.<ref>{{cite book |title=Road, River and Good Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb |last=Scarbrough |first=Linda |year=2009 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-87611-202-1 |page=82 }}</ref> Due to Round Rock's favorable geographic location over the rich, fertile "[[Texas blackland prairies|blackland prairie]]" soils also known locally as the "black waxy"<ref name="Scarbrough 2009">{{cite book |title=Road, River and Good Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb |last=Scarbrough |first=Linda |year=2009 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-87611-202-1 }}</ref> (due to the soil's high clay content), cotton was the largest economic driver at that time. Because of the soil and climate, this ecoregion is ideally suited to crop agriculture. Nearby [[Taylor, Texas]], east of Round Rock, was the primary cotton center where the crop was hauled for [[cotton gin|ginning]] (its seeds mechanically removed) at the [[cotton gin]], compressed into bales, and shipped by train. Austin was also a cotton center for a time once the railroad arrived there in the 1870s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Road, River and Good Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb |last=Scarbrough |first=Linda |year=2009 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-87611-202-1 |pages=250–251 }}</ref> Cotton production and cattle raising, on a much smaller scale, continues today, although primarily east of Round Rock.

====Chisholm Trail Crossing Park====

To preserve the heritage of the famous crossing, a [[Chisholm Trail Crossing Park]] was developed to provide visitors with a simulated scene of Round Rock's historical role in the Chisholm cattle drive. Commemorative plaques in the park tell of the history of Round Rock. The bronze sculptures of four steers and pioneer woman Hattie Cluck and her son, Emmitt, were commissioned by the city through donations from Round Rock residents. The sculptures depict Round Rock's history as a crossing location along the Chisholm Trail.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recalling family connections along Round Rock's old Chisholm Trail |first=Edward |last=Torres |newspaper=Round Rock Leader |date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://www.rrleader.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=21022&SectionID=7&SubSectionID=7&S=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205750/http://www.rrleader.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=21022&SectionID=7&SubSectionID=7&S=1 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref> The project plans include 18 to 20 additional bronze statues over time.

====Old Settlers Association====

[[File:OSAEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the Old Settlers Association facilities in Round Rock, Texas]]
Following the end of the [[American Civil War]], a group of Confederate veterans held a reunion in Georgetown on August 27, 1904, for the old settlers of Williamson County and their descendants. The invitation promised "good music, plenty to eat, and above all a warm welcome." The event was well-attended, and reunions—now called Old Settlers Association (OSA) reunions—have been held annually ever since. After the initial one, the event was moved to Round Rock and eventually a structure was built (along with three restored log cabins) in the Palm Valley area of Round Rock, in front of Old Settlers Park, just off Highway 79 in east Round Rock. All members of the organization are descendants of Williamson County residents prior to 1904. OSA has about 50 active members and 300 members in all.<ref>{{cite news |title=Round Rock Old Settlers Association |first=Amy |last=Stansbury |newspaper=Community Impact Newspaper |date=July 3, 2008 |url=http://impactnews.com/round-rock-pflugerville/nonprofit/1292-old-settlers-association-round-rock |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411052559/http://impactnews.com/round-rock-pflugerville/nonprofit/1292-old-settlers-association-round-rock |archive-date=April 11, 2010 }}</ref> The Old Settlers Association today is a social and educational group, with the purpose of facilitating social activities, as well as collecting and preserving important historical information and facts. The facilities are rented for meetings, arts and craft and collectable shows, events, parties, weddings and rehearsal dinners.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical Round Rock Texas |last=Thompson |first=Karen R. |author2=Jane H. Digesualado  |publisher=Nortex Press (Eakin Publications) |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=<!--none -->}}</ref>

====Economic impact of Interstate 35====

In the 1950s, planners of the new [[Interstate Highway System]] proposed to route Interstate 35 through Taylor, whose population and cotton industry made it the county's economic powerhouse. Highway Commissioner [[Dewitt C. Greer State Highway Building|DeWitt Greer]] called for the "[[Interregional Highways|interregional]]" highway to go through Taylor on its way from [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], but some Taylor leaders and other citizens fought the idea, worried about the possibility of cutting farmers off from all or part of their fields, traffic noise, damage to country life, loss of farmland, and unwanted right-of-way acquisition—it was proposed to be an astounding {{convert|300|ft|m|sigfig=1}} wide, unheard of before this time. No one even knew what an "Interregional Highway" would look like, unless they had traveled to [[Germany]] to see the [[Autobahn]] or the [[Merritt Parkway]] in [[Connecticut]]. Instead, they wanted improvements to the [[farm-to-market road]]s and a straight route to Austin.<ref>{{cite book |title=Road, River and Good Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb |last=Scarbrough |first=Linda |year=2009 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-87611-202-1 |pages=53–256 }}</ref>

Meanwhile, Round Rock leaders sought the highway and its potential economic benefits. Mayor Louis Henna lobbied the Highway Commission. In June 1956, the 15-year debate over the form, funding, and route of the Interstate was resolved.<ref>{{cite book |title=Road, River and Good Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb |last=Scarbrough |first=Linda |year=2009 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-87611-202-1 |page=271 }}</ref> Due to the heavy lobbying, and not wanting to antagonize Taylor, the highway was built along the edge of the Balcones Fault line, running through Round Rock. The precise route was not without opposition, however, as the new road cut off "Old Town" to the west from what had become the more recent "downtown" area east of Interstate 35.<ref>{{cite book |title=Road, River and Good Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb |last=Scarbrough |first=Linda |year=2009 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-87611-202-1 |page=257 }}</ref> The Interstate eventually made Round Rock into a viable and vibrant commercial center, while Taylor withered with the decline of the cotton industry. Today, it is a minor, modest town with a smaller population, while Round Rock has thrived and rapidly grown into the largest city in the county, attracting Dell Computer and major retail centers.<ref name="Scarbrough 2009 259"/> The transformation of Round Rock is detailed in a book by Linda Scarborough (publisher of the ''Williamson County Sun'' newspaper) titled ''Road, River and Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb'' published by Texas State Historical Press.<ref name="Scarbrough 2009"/>

====Life as a Suburb community====

By the 1990s, Round Rock was primarily a suburb, with the majority of its employed residents working in Austin and then returning home after work to places such as Round Rock and Georgetown, where housing and land were less expensive. In the 1990s, Round Rock had few major employers and jobs other than local retail and other services, or ranching and farming.<ref name="Thompson 78"/> In the late 1990s, though, that began to change as [[economic development]] became a major focus of the city and the [[Chamber of Commerce]]. [[Dell]] Corporation moved its headquarters to Round Rock, which has provided a significant number of jobs with 16,000 employees at its Round Rock headquarters.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619172815/http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/aboutdell-worldwide.aspx Dell Worldwide]."

==Government==
===City government===
The city of Round Rock is managed through a council-manager form of government. The city council is composed of six city council members and the mayor. The mayor and all council members are elected at large and serve the entire city, not by geographic precincts. The mayor ''pro tem'' is appointed annually by council members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=199 |title=About the Round Rock City Council |author=City of Round Rock |work=City of Round Rock website |access-date=July 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712043041/http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=199 |archive-date=July 12, 2010 }}</ref> City Council positions are not full-time jobs. The council appoints a full-time city manager, who manages the daily affairs of the city, and all council meetings are held at 221 E. Main Street, in downtown Round Rock, on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 7 pm, unless indicated otherwise. Council meetings are televised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=199 |title=About the Round Rock City Council |author=City of Round Rock |work=City of Round Rock website |access-date=August 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712043041/http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=199 |archive-date=July 12, 2010 }}</ref>

===Other political subdivisions===
[[Municipal utility district]]s, commonly referred to as "MUDs", play a significant role in Round Rock. Each is a special-purpose district that provides [[public utilities]] such as water, [[sewage treatment|wastewater]], [[storm water]], and sometimes roads, [[parks]], [[solid waste]], and other infrastructure and services to the residents of each district. MUDs are typically formed by a [[developer (land)|residential developer]] as a means to install utilities and roads to a project when a city is not ready or able to provide them. The developer gets reimbursed over time from the fees levied by the MUD, and at some point the area may be [[annexed]] by the city to bring the development into the city's tax base once the basic infrastructure costs are paid off.<ref>{{cite news |title=City to buy regional wastewater system |first=Kathryn |last=Eakens |newspaper=Round Rock Leader |date=June 10, 2009 |url=http://www.rrleader.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=21946&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=1&S=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205908/http://www.rrleader.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=21946&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=1&S=1 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>  The MUD is represented by its own [[board of directors]], who are voted on by the residents of the district, and it has the authority to condemn land, add additional land area, and levy fees in lieu of property taxes to maintain the utilities and other facilities.

Ten MUDs are in Round Rock: Brushy Creek, Fern Bluff, Highlands at Mayfield Ranch, Meadows at Chandler Creek, Paloma Lake, Parkside at Mayfield Ranch, Siena, Teravista, Vista Oaks, and Walsh Ranch. Total population living within these MUDs is 47,648 (2010 city estimate).<ref>City of Round Rock email from Joel Jordan, City Planning Department, August 12, 2010</ref>

Round Rock's largest district is Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcmud.org/|title=Home - Brushy Creek MUD|website=www.bcmud.org|access-date=May 3, 2017}}</ref> Brushy Creek MUD was formed as Williamson County Municipal Utility District No. 2 in October 1977 with {{convert|725|acre|km2|sigfig=2}} of land. An annexation in 1983 increased the District to {{convert|2210|acre|km2|sigfig=2}}. The district name was changed to Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District in August 1990. The MUD provides a wide range of city-like services including parks and recreation, full utilities, road maintenance and a [[Homeowner association|Home Owner's Association]]. Services a MUD can offer, however are also limited by law (for example they cannot offer library services).

Another similar but somewhat smaller MUD in Round Rock's is Fern Bluff Municipal Utility District<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fernbluffmud.org/|title=front - Fern Bluff MUD|website=Fern Bluff MUD|access-date=May 3, 2017}}</ref> in the Wyoming Springs area of town. Both MUDs play a significant role in local governance and maintenance of basic utilities.

From time to time, elections to the boards were contentious and heated debates arose regarding other MUD issues.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stempko, McLaughlin vie for MUD position; Newcomers enter as Bradley departs |first=Lauri |last=Zachry |newspaper=Round Rock Leader |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://www.rrleader.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=24537&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=1&S=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205814/http://www.rrleader.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=24537&SectionID=1&SubSectionID=1&S=1 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref> Round Rock does not often annex a MUD to avoiding having to take on the aging infrastructure replacement and upkeep costs.

===Higher education===

[[File:RRHECpicFlowers.JPG|thumb|upright|The Avery Building on the Round Campus of [[Texas State University]]]]
Round Rock also has a number of higher education opportunities. In 1990, the city, under the leadership of then-City Manager Bob Bennett, planning director Joe Vining, and local citizen Mike Swayze envisioned and oversaw creation of the [[Texas State University Round Rock Campus]] (or Round Rock Higher Education Center). The concept was envisioned as a way to lure colleges and universities to jointly provide education, training, and degree opportunities on part-time and full-time bases. The center used various empty facilities around town, and many of the initial training programs were targeted to help educate students for work at local companies, such as Dell, which had specialized needs. In 2008, an educational campus and the first RRC building—the Avery Building—was opened through the combined efforts of [[Texas State University]], [[Austin Community College]], and [[Temple College]] in order to provide a broader range of educational opportunities, specialized training, and varying degree programs including post graduate degrees. The campus is in the heart of the emerging Avery Center development which houses Seton Williamson, the A&M Health Science Center and other medical campuses. By the end of 2009 1,700 students were enrolled in the programs. Texas State University has taken on the lead role in this effort and {{convert|100|acres|ha}} of land for the facility and additional buildings were donated by the Avery family of Round Rock, whose family members were early settlers on the land surrounding the center. Construction on the second Texas State campus building is underway and construction is nearly complete on this additional classroom building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rrhec.txstate.edu/rrhecord/rrhecord-july10.html |title=RRHECord Newsletter |date= July 2010 |access-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref> ''(See also [[Texas State University Round Rock Campus]])''

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Major highways====
*[[File:I-35.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|Interstate 35]]

====Toll roads====
[[File:Texas45.jpg|thumb|right|The interchange of [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] and [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] under construction in 2004]]
[[File:SH45 sign-don.jpg|thumb|right|SH 45 was built on a fast-track basis with bonds sold in advance based on the projected toll revenues.]]

In November 2006, the [[Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority]] (CTRMA)<ref>{{cite news |title=On the road again |first=D. Ann |last=Shiffler |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=September 26, 2003 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2003/09/29/focus1.html?page=2 }}</ref> opened the first segment of the region's first [[toll road]] system. Both [[Texas State Highway 130|State Highway 130]] and [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] toll roads run through portions of Round Rock and provide greatly increased mobility to the city, albeit with strong regional opposition to the high-toll charges to motorists. [[State Highway 130 (Texas)|State Highway 130]] runs just south of [[Austin Bergstrom International Airport]] at US Highway 183 and connecting to [[Interstate 35]] north of [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]], and passes through the easternmost portion of Round Rock. It provides Round Rock residents with quick access to the Austin airport for about $6 each way. The project, when completed, will end at [[Interstate 10]] just east of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]], about {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} east-northeast of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] essentially creating a parallel roadway to [[Interstate 35]].

[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] is part of an eventual loop that runs east from State Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 at [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (east of Round Rock) where it merges with the SH 130 toll road, and then intersects with the southern portion of SH 45 near Buda, south of Austin. SH 45 passes through the entire southern portion of Round Rock. Highway 45 provides much faster access between Round Rock and Austin, alleviating what was previously a major bottleneck at [[Interstate 35]]. The project includes a tolled extension to [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Loop 1]] (also known locally as the [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|"Mopac Expressway"]]) and allows direct access from to I-35 to Loop 1 by use of flyover connections rather than ground level intersections. The toll roads also provide access to the [[Dell]] headquarters and its considerable number of employees. Together, both toll roads significantly improve mobility in Round Rock.
