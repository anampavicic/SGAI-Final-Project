Also referred to as '''Stavropol-on-Volga''' ({{langx|ru|Ста́врополь-на-Во́лге|Stávropol-na-Vólge|label=none}}) or '''Stavropol-Volzhsky''' ({{lang|ru|Ста́врополь-Во́лжский}}).}} is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Samara Oblast]], [[Russia]]. It is the largest city in Russia which is neither the [[administrative center]] of a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]], nor the largest city of a subject. Population: {{ru-census|p2021=684,709|p2010=719,632|p2002=702,879|p1989=630,543}}{{Historical populations|1897|5969|1926|6473|1939|9345|1959|61281|1970|250853|1979|502036|1989|630543|2002|702879|2010|719632|2021|684709|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}The city is best known as the home of Russia's largest car manufacturer [[AvtoVAZ]] ([[Lada]]). For this reason, Tolyatti is often dubbed "Russia's motor city" or "Russia's Motown" (in reference to [[Detroit]] in the [[United States]]—the spiritual home of the American automotive industry). It was renamed after Italian communist politician [[Palmiro Togliatti]] in 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tgl.ru/tgl/eng/city/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310231137/http://www.tgl.ru/tgl/eng/city/history.htm|url-status=dead|title=Office of the Mayor: History and geography|archive-date=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Stavropol was founded as a fortress in 1737 by the Russian statesman [[Vasily Tatishchev]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tgl.ru/history|title = История / О Тольятти / Администрация городского округа Тольятти}}</ref> It was often informally referred to as ''Stavropol-on-Volga'' to distinguish it from [[Stavropol]], a larger city in southwest Russia, although ''Stavropol-on-Volga'' was never its official name.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edu-sok.ru/upload/Prokofeva%20E_U.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 1, 2019 |archive-date=December 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210221330/http://www.edu-sok.ru/upload/Prokofeva%20E_U.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/arhiv/040423150950.htm|title=Русская семья со шведской фамилией / Православие.Ru|website=www.pravoslavie.ru}}</ref>

The construction of the [[Zhiguli Hydroelectric Station|Kuybyshev Dam and Hydroelectric Station]] on the [[Volga River]] in the 1950s created the [[Kuybyshev Reservoir]], which flooded the existing location of the city, and it was completely rebuilt on a new site.

In 1964, the city was chosen as the location of the new VAZ automobile plant: a joint venture between [[Fiat]] and the Soviet government. It was then renamed Tolyatti after [[Palmiro Togliatti]], the longest-serving secretary of the [[Italian Communist Party]], who had been instrumental in setting up the venture with Fiat. Much of the modern city was constructed in the 1960s to house the workers of the factory, and today [[AvtoVAZ]] dominates the economy of the city.<ref>[https://ria.ru/20230210/lada-1851298218.html "АвтоВАЗ" запустил предсерийное производство Lada Vesta NG]</ref>

==Administrative and municipal status==
[[File:Районы Тольятти.png|thumb|left|250px|City divisions<br />{{legend|fuchsia|Avtozavodsky City District}} {{legend|Orange|Tsentralny (Central) City District}} {{legend|Yellow|Komsomolsky City District}}]]
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], Tolyatti serves as the [[administrative center]] of [[Stavropolsky District]],<ref name="OKATO">{{OKATO reference|36 240}}</ref> even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="OKATO2">{{OKATO reference|36 440}}</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Tolyatti'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Samara Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref278">Charter of Samara Oblast''</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Tolyatti is incorporated as '''Tolyatti Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref279">Law #189-GD</ref>

===City divisions===
For the administrative purposes, the city is divided into three districts:
*[[Avtozavodsky City District, Tolyatti|Avtozavodsky]] ({{lang|ru|Автозаво́дский}}), also called Novy Gorod (literally ''New City''), is the most modern; it was designed to host the workers of the city's [[AvtoVAZ]] factory, home of the [[Lada]] car;
*[[Tsentralny City District, Tolyatti|Tsentralny]] ({{lang|ru|Центра́льный}}), also called Stary Gorod (lit. ''Old City''), home of the city government and industrial center;
*[[Komsomolsky City District|Komsomolsky]] ({{lang|ru|Комсомо́льский}}), the oldest district, built to house Hydroelectrical Plant builders.

==Economy==

[[File:AvtoVAZ administration building-5389.JPG|thumb|right|230px|AvtoVAZ administration building]]
The city's main claim to fame has been automobiles [[Lada]] ([[Zhiguli (car brand)|Zhiguli]]) manufactured by [[AvtoVAZ]] car plant employing some 110,000 people: in cooperation with [[Fiat|Italy's Fiat]] since 1970, with [[General Motors]] since 2001<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lada-owners-club.co.uk/|title=Home|website=www.lada-owners-club.co.uk}}</ref> and with the [[Renault-Nissan Alliance]] since 2012, and once again becoming an independent, state-owned enterprise in 2022.

Other industries have moved into Tolyatti because it is close to abundant supplies of electricity and water. Petrochemicals are well represented in the city. Among the significant enterprises based there are "[[TogliattiAzot]]" (Russia's biggest ammonia manufacturer headed{{when|date=February 2015}}<!-- when was this current? --> by [[Sergei Makhlai]]) and "[[KuibyshevAzot]]" (a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and Russia's biggest [[caprolactam]] and [[polyamide]] producer). Other industries include building materials production, ship repair and electrical equipment and electronics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 2011 the Tolyatti [[Special Economic Zone]] was launched in order to develop the region further and diversify the economy of the city. Several auto-component producers (German Mubea and Japanese Sanoh among them) have since been registered, as well as large industrial manufacturers ([[Praxair]] and [[Edscha]]). By November 2012 the value of project investment totalled 10 billion Rubles and around 3000 jobs were being created.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeztlt.ru/en/|title=Особая экономическая зона "Тольятти"|website=oeztlt.ru}}</ref>

===Transportation===
The transport system is well developed in the city. Public transport includes municipal buses and trolley-buses, and so-called "alternative" (commercial) transport or [[marshrutka]]s.

External transport routes are provided by two bus stations, two railway stations and a city harbour. Tolyatti has its airport as well, but it is used by personal aircraft only (the nearest international airport, [[Kurumoch International Airport|Kurumoch]], is located 40&nbsp;km away, towards [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]). The city is linked to the federal road network by the [[M5 highway (Russia)|M5 "Ural" highway]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}<gallery mode="packed">

==Culture, education, and sports==

The creation of the [[Kuybyshev Reservoir]] in the 1950s destroyed much of the city's history, so almost all the city's cultural points of interest date from the Soviet period, but the city administration has continued to build new monuments and cathedrals. A recent notable event was the 1998 opening of the large [[Tatishchev Monument (Tolyatti)|Tatishchev Monument]] near the [[Volga]]. The [[Transfiguration Cathedral (Tolyatti)|Transfiguration Cathedral]] was completed in 2002.

===Education===
Education is represented by over one hundred public and ten private schools, as well as several [[education in Russia|higher education]] institutions. Most notable ones include:
*[[Togliatti State University]] ({{lang|ru|Тольяттинский государственный университет, ТГУ}})
*[https://www.tolgas.ru/vrsus/university/ Volga Region State University of Service] ({{lang|ru|Поволжский государственный университет сервиса, ПВГУС}})
*Tatishchev University of Volga ({{lang|ru|Волжский университет имени В. Н. Татищева, ВУиТ}})
*Togliatti Academy of Management ({{lang|ru|Тольяттинская академия управления, ТАУ}})

===Museums===
*[[AvtoVAZ Technical Museum]]
*Tolyatti museum of local lore

===Sports===
In the eyes of the Soviet leaders, Tolyatti was a perfect Soviet city (since most population migrated here during the construction of AvtoVAZ factories)&nbsp;– many sports facilities appeared so that the "perfect Soviet person" could be healthy. The city has high-quality sports facilities: gymnasiums, swimming pools, ice arenas, association football and racing stadiums&nbsp;— as a result, many athletes, including Olympic Champion [[Alexei Nemov]], [[Stanley Cup]] winners [[Alexei Kovalev]] and [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] had moved to Tolyatti. Former Montreal Canadiens defenseman [[Alexei Emelin]], and former Washington Capitals winger [[Viktor Kozlov]] and defenseman Alexei Tezikov were born there. [[Daria Kasatkina]], a professional tennis player, was born there.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.wtatennis.com/players/322082/daria-kasatkina| title = Daria Kasatkina {{!}} Player Stats & More – WTA Official}}</ref>

Tolyatti is represented in almost every kind of team sports. [[HC Lada Togliatti|Tolyatti's Lada-sponsored Ice Hockey Club]] broke the Moscow teams' domination of the game. The Lada women's football team has won the Russian championship several times&nbsp;— and the Lada women's handball team, who are the Russian and European Champions, is the core for Russian national women's handball. Men's football ([[FC Lada Togliatti]]), basketball and handball teams also take part in national championships. As for the traditional national sport of Russia, [[bandy]], there is a team founded in 2013, TOAZ,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/club/576/|title=Информация о команде "ТОАЗ" Самарская область - Реестр - Федерация хоккея с мячом России|website=rusbandy.ru}}</ref> which however only takes part in a recreational league.

[[Mega-Lada Togliatti]] who race at the [[Anatoly Stepanov Stadium]] are a record 17-times [[Russian Team Speedway Championship|champions of Russia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyspeedway.nstrefa.pl/dmrosji.php |title=Russian Team Championship |website=Speedway History |access-date=8 April 2024}}</ref>
