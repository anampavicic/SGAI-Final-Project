'''Espírito Santo''' ({{IPA|pt|(i)sˈpiɾitu ˈsɐ̃tu|lang|Pt-br_Espírito Santo.ogg}}; {{literal translation|[[Holy Spirit]]}}) is a [[states of Brazil|state]] in [[Southeast Region, Brazil|southeastern]] [[Brazil]]. Its capital is [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], and its largest city is [[Serra, Espirito Santo|Serra]].<ref name="IBGE2" /> With an extensive [[coastline]], the state hosts some of the country's main ports, and its beaches are significant tourist attractions.

The capital, Vitória, is located on an island, which borders the municipalities of [[Vila Velha]], [[Cariacica]], and [[Serra, Espirito Santo|Serra]]. These municipalities, plus the outer cities of [[Fundão, Espírito Santo|Fundão]] and [[Guarapari]], constitute the state's main [[metro area]]. In the northern extremes of Espírito Santo is Itaúnas, in the municipality of [[Conceição da Barra, Espírito Santo|Conceição da Barra]], which is a tourist location known for its sand [[dune]]s and [[forró]] tradition.

The [[Captaincy of Espírito Santo]] was carved out of the [[Captaincies of Brazil|Captaincy of Bahia]] in the 18th century, during the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial rule of Brazil]], and named after a 16th-century captaincy covering roughly the same area of coast. Following the elevation of Brazil to a [[Constituent state|constituent kingdom]] of [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] in 1815, prompted by the [[transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]], Espírito Santo was elevated to a [[Provinces of Brazil|province]]. After the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, it became a province of the newly established [[Empire of Brazil]], and after Brazil [[First Brazilian Republic|became a republic]] in 1889, it was granted statehood. In the early 20th century, its current state symbols were adopted.

==Etymology==
Espírito Santo's namesake is the Christian [[Holy Ghost]] (also known as the Holy Spirit).

==Demonym==
Debate exists as to the origin of the term ''capixaba'', the unofficial [[demonym]] for those born in Espírito Santo. "Capixaba" is [[Tupi language|Tupi]] for "corn hair", reportedly because the blond hair of the European settlers reminded the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] natives of the golden color of corn. A more mainstream explanation is that the name is a metaphor for a corn-grower; Vitória Island is known to have been full of corn [[plantations]] in the early centuries of Portuguese rule in Brazil. A third etymology is from the name of a local tribe, borrowed by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] during the colonial period.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Originally, ''capixaba'' referred only to people from Vitória, but in common parlance, it eventually came to refer to those born anywhere in the state. The official state demonym, however, is "espírito-santense".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Espírito Santo}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Convento da Penha - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|[[Penha Convent]] founded in 1558]]
Espírito Santo was first inhabited by [[Amerindians]], whose different tribes were usually semi-nomadic, but precolonial Brazil has no recorded history. The area was colonized by the Portuguese starting in the 16th century, and received African slaves, and later, European immigrants of various origins.

===Colonial era and Empire of Brazil===
[[File:Germans_and_luxembourgers_in_brazil_1875.jpg|thumb|left|German and Luxembourgish immigrants in Espírito Santo in 1875]]
The Captaincy of Espírito Santo, a hereditary [[fief]], was granted to [[Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, captain of Espírito Santo|Vasco Coutinho]] by [[Manuel I of Portugal]] around three decades after the Portuguese [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|first landed in Brazil]] in 1500. He arrived at the captaincy to serve his term on 23 May 1535, bringing a retinue of 60 soldiers, colonists, slaves, and servants. They settled on Vitória Island and around the Bay of Vitória.

The capital was at first established in [[Vila Velha]], but due to frequent raids by Amerindians, it was moved to the current capital of Vitória, founded on 8 September 1551, on an island near Vila Velha, which was later named Vitória Island.

In 1556, after the arrival of European missionaries, the cities Serra, [[Nova Almeida, Espírito Santo|Nova Almeida]], and Santa Cruz were founded.

The captaincy remained under the influence of Coutinho's family for 140 years. It was elevated to [[Provinces of Brazil|province]] status in 1821, following the 1815 elevation of Brazil to a constituent kingdom of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], prompted by the 1808 [[transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil]]. The Portuguese court were fleeing the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)]].

After the [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822, Espírito Santo's provincial status was kept, and it was headed by an appointed provincial president. Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], who was on good terms with the provincial president, visited the Espírito Santo in 1860, during one of his tours of Brazil.

===Modern history===
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
[[Image:Vila Velha.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vila Velha]] is the most populous municipality in the state.]]
In 1889, with the advent of the [[First Brazilian Republic]], Espírito Santo was made one of the [[States of Brazil|states]] of Brazil. [[Afonso Cláudio de Freitas Rosa]] was appointed the first [[List of Governors of Espírito Santo|governor of the state]] by the provisional government. He was followed by four other appointed governors ([[José Horácio Costa]], [[Constante Gomes Sodré]], [[Henrique da Silva Coutinho]], and [[Antonio Gomez Aguirre|Antônio Gomez Aguirre]]) until the first elected governor of Espírito Santo, [[Alfeu Adolfo Monjardim de Andrade e Almeida]], was [[inauguration|inaugurated]] on 7 June 1891.

During the [[Vargas Era]], state governors were [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] by [[Congress of Brazil|Congress]]. A short period of democracy existed during the [[Second Brazilian Republic]]; Carlos Monteiro Lindenberg was elected governor. However, after the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 ''coup d'état'']], governors were once again chosen by the national assembly. After Cristiano Dias Lopes, Arthur Carlos Gerhard Santos, [[Élcio Álvares]], and Eurico Rezende were chosen in this fashion, the military government [[History of Brazil since 1985|slowly redemocratized]], culminating in the adoption of Brazil's current [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Constitution]]. Democratic elections were held for the filling of every term, up to the incumbent, [[Renato Casagrande]].

==Economy==
[[File:Pancas.jpg|thumb|Pontões Capixabas Natural Monument]]
During the first three centuries of Portuguese [[colonialism]], the main [[cash crop]] was [[sugarcane]], until coffee, in high demand in Europe, overtook it in the mid-19th century. During the colonial era, periods of [[gold rush]] occurred, when agriculture was neglected, leading to [[Economic shortage|food shortages]], but not as much gold was found in Espírito Santo, as in the neighbouring states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Another reason for the subdued expansion was the colonial administration's prohibition of the laying roads leading into Minas Gerais, as gold could be [[smuggle]]d through the state.

==Geography==
[[Image:Map of Espirito Santo Geography.PNG|175px|thumb|right|Geography of Espírito Santo]]
With {{convert|46180|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, it is about the size of Estonia, or half the size of Portugal, and has a variety of habitats including coastal plains, lakes, mountainous forests, mangroves and many others.

The [[volcanic island]]s of [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], {{convert|715|km|mi|sp=us}} east of [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean, are part of Espírito Santo.

===Location===
[[Image:Espírito Santo Köppen.svg|thumb|right|Climate of Espírito Santo]]
This Brazilian state is in the east of the southeastern subdivision of Brazil, which also contains the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Minas Gerais and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean (E), the state of [[Bahia]] (N), the state of [[Minas Gerais]] (N and W), and the state of [[Rio de Janeiro]] (S). Espírito Santo's main cities (outside the [[Greater Vitória]] region) are [[Cachoeiro de Itapemirim]], [[Colatina]], [[Linhares]], [[São Mateus, Espírito Santo|São Mateus]] and [[Aracruz, Espírito Santo|Aracruz]].

===Rivers===
The main river serving the state is the [[Doce River|Doce]] (English: Sweet River). Other important river basins include the {{ill|Santa Maria River (Vitória)|lt=Santa Maria River|pt|Rio Santa Maria da Vitória}} basin, the northern branch of the inlets flowing into the sea near Vitória, and the Jucu River Basin, which flows into the sea at roughly the same place, but corresponds to the southern branch.

===Climate===

Espírito Santo's climate is tropical along the coast, with dry winters and rainy summers. North of [[Doce River]] is generally drier and also hot. In the mountainous regions in the south and southwest of the state, the tropical climate is strongly influenced by altitude, and the average temperatures are lower.

===Lakes===
One of the most important lake districts in Brazil lies on the banks of the Doce River. The area contains some 26 large lakes, the biggest of which is called [[Juparanã Lagoon]].

===Topography===
The state can be divided into two areas: the low lying coastline and the highland area known as ''Serra'' (where one can find the 2,890 meter tall [[Pico da Bandeira]]), which is part of the larger [[Serra do Caparaó]] [[mountain range|range]].

===Culture===
The precolonial Amerindians groups in Espírito Santo were the [[Tupiniquim]], [[Temininó]], [[Aymoré]], [[Purí people|Puri]], and [[Botocudo]]. They have largely been absorbed into the Portuguese-Brazilian civilization, and few live in reservations or tribes.
[[Image:Praia_do_Morro_by_Diego_Baravelli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Guarapari]] during summer]]
[[File:Palácio Anchieta, Vitória ES.jpg|thumb|left|Anchieta Palace]]
Especially in the 16th century, several towns in Espírito Santo were founded with primarily Amerindian populations converted to Catholicism, such as Serra and [[Santa Cruz, Espírito Santo|Santa Cruz]]. Amerindian food has left its legacy in ''capixaba'' culture; the fish-based ''[[Moqueca]] capixaba ''is the state dish, among other local typical seafood dishes.

One large ethnic group in the state is known as Turcos. Technically from the region that is now Syria and Lebanon, they came to the state fleeing World War I. As at the time, they were Ottoman Empire citizens, they were commonly called "Turcos" (Turks). Large communities were established in the southern part of the state. Now, their descendants control a good share of the local commerce. The Arab-Brazilians of Espírito Santo are generally [[Maronite Christians]].

About 60–75% of the population of Espírito Santo has Italian ancestry, making it the state with the highest percentage of Italian descendants in Brazil.<ref name="Itália Nossa">{{cite web |url=http://www.italianossa.com.br/site.php?area=estatistica&PHPSESSID=48a1a4e26ce2388867024965cbfef484 |title=Imigração italiana por Estados e Regiões do Brasil |website=italianossa.com.br |publisher= |language=pt-BR |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107042129/http://www.italianossa.com.br/site.php?area=estatistica&PHPSESSID=48a1a4e26ce2388867024965cbfef484 |archive-date=7 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/periodic/precedenti/01/6/espirito.htm |title=Espírito Santo, lo stato più veneto del Brasile |first=Cilmar |last=Franceschetto |date=June 2001 |website=regione.veneto.it |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040316191344/http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/periodic/precedenti/01/6/espirito.htm |archive-date=16 March 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=José Carlos |last=Mattedi |url=http://aplic.vitoria.es.gov.br/pmv/calandra.nsf/0/8688D942E5AB6F7783256FBF006E63CD?OpenDocument&pub=T&proj=internet&gen=Doc+Diario2 |title=Consulado italiano vai abrir dois escritórios em Vitória para agilizar pedidos de cidadania |trans-title= |website=vitoria.es.gov.br |language=pt-BR |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810085315/http://aplic.vitoria.es.gov.br/pmv/calandra.nsf/0/8688D942E5AB6F7783256FBF006E63CD?OpenDocument&pub=T&proj=internet&gen=Doc+Diario2 |archive-date=10 August 2011 |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Nara |last=Saletto |url=http://www.anpuhes.hpg.ig.com.br/ensaio25.htm |title=Sobre a composição étnica da população capixaba |website=anpuhes.hpg.ig.com.br |language=pt-BR |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125165925/http://anpuhes.hpg.ig.com.br/ensaio25.htm |archive-date=25 January 2009 |access-date=}}</ref> They founded many towns in the area and have significant influence on ''capixaba'' society. A number of traditional Italian dance groups are still in the state, as are Italian culture festivals, such as the one held in [[Venda Nova do Imigrante]]. Italian food is also an important part of ''capixaba'' cuisine. Italian pasta and cheeses, such as [[mozzarella]], are produced locally. Small-scale farming, which is turning increasingly towards [[Agritourism|agrotourism]], is appealing to its Italian roots to exploit that market.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

[[Germans]] were among the first colonists to cultivate land away from the coastal zone, and were a strong influence. The first German settlement, [[Santa Isabel, Espírito Santo|Santa Isabel]], was founded in 1844, and still stands. Like today's ''capixaba'' Italian community, they still hold on to many aspects of their ancestors' homeland's culture, as represented in festivals such as the Sommerfest in [[Domingos Martins]]. Domingos Martins also hosts a Colonization Museum, where one can find old photos, artifacts, and documents pertaining to that settlement movement.

Espírito Santo is home to the biggest community of [[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]] speakers in the world. More than a century after arriving to Espírito Santo, East Pomeranian continues to be spoken and remains an important part of Espírito Santo's heritage for many people. To this day, they continue centuries-old customs within their communities. 

Between 1858 and 1862, a group of Dutch settlers from [[Zeeuws-Vlaanderen]] migrated to the state. In the area of Santa Leopoldina, their dialect of Dutch, which they call ''Ollans'' but is in fact a variety of Zeeuws-Vlaams influenced by Pomeranian, is still spoken by about 20 speakers. It is therefore severely endangered.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bremenkamp |first1=Elizana |last2=Rys |first2=Kathy |last3=Nevins |first3=Andrew |last4=Postma |first4=Gertjan |date=13 July 2017 |title=ZEEUWS-FLEMISH IN BRAZIL: MULTILINGUALISM AND LANGUAGE DECAY |url=http://www.gragoata.uff.br/index.php/gragoata/article/view/852 |journal=Gragoatá |pages=435–472 |doi=10.22409/gragoata.2017n42a852 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |hdl=10067/1486380151162165141 |hdl-access=free}}</ref>

The first African slaves in Espírito Santo arrived in Vitória in 1609, and years of slavery ensued. Espírito Santo, though, was still to play a significant part in the Brazilian abolitionist movement in the guise of its slave rebellion of 1848–1849, which required the intervention of imperial troops. Slavery began to lose its economic importance in Espírito Santo after that event.

Pinning down the exact numbers of immigrants of several ethnic groups from Europe is difficult. Many of these groups came to Espírito Santo under a common [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian–Hungarian]] passport, or in the case of the Tyroleans, under an Italian passport. Tyrolean settlers were both of German and Italian language and concentrated in the region of Santa Leopoldina and Santa Teresa. [[Romanians]] (especially from [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]]) and [[Romani people|Roma]] usually arrived under Austrian passports. Large groups of [[Romani people]] settled in Espírito Santo's countryside in the late 19th century.

==Economy==
[[File:Café conilon Timbuí.JPG|thumb|[[Coffea canephora]] in [[Timbuí]]]]

The [[service sector]] is the largest component of GDP at 50%, followed by the industrial sector at 44%. Agriculture represents 5% of GDP (2004). Espírito Santo's exports consisted mainly of manufacturing of iron and steel 35.8%, iron ore 25.2%, paper 17.6%, coffee 7.7%, and [[granite]] 6.5% (as of 2002).

Espírito Santo is Brazil's highest steel-producing state. The main crops grown are coffee, sugarcane, and fruits (mostly coconuts, bananas and [[papaya]]s). The livestock industry is represented primarily by cattle raised for milk and beef. Industry consists mainly of canning, forestry, textiles, and iron and steel works. The latter two are concentrated around [[Cariacica]] and the [[Vale do Rio Doce]] ironworks.

Vitória is an important port for the exporting of iron and steel; the state is among the biggest steel-producing regions the world.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In [[São Mateus, Espírito Santo|São Mateus]], petroleum reserves have been found on the continental shelf, and are being commercially exploited.

In agricultural production, coffee, sugarcane, papaya, banana, and coconut stand out. It also produces [[cassava]], oranges, and beans.

In 2020, Espírito Santo was the largest producer of ''[[Coffea canephora]]'' in Brazil, with a 66.3% share of the total (564.5 thousand tons, or 9.4&nbsp;million 60&nbsp;kg bags). In 2017, Minas accounted for 54.3% of the total national coffee production (first place), Espírito Santo accounted for 19.7% (second place) and São Paulo, 9.8% (third place).<ref name="agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br">{{cite web |url=https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/agencia-sala-de-imprensa/2013-agencia-de-noticias/releases/26537-ibge-preve-safra-recorde-de-graos-em-2020 |title=IBGE prevê safra recorde de grãos em 2020 |website=ibge.gov.br |date=8 January 2020 |publisher=Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) |language=pt-BR |access-date=}}</ref><ref name="crea-pr.org.br">{{cite web |url=https://www.crea-pr.org.br/ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GA_Jacarezinho_0111.pdf |title=A Reivenção da cafeicultura no Paraná |website=crea-pr.org.br |publisher= |language=pt-BR |access-date= |archive-date=21 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921161317/https://www.crea-pr.org.br/ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GA_Jacarezinho_0111.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the north of the state, beef cattle are raised and fattened, and the meat industry was developed; the meat is mainly shipped to Rio de Janeiro, in addition to supplying the region of Vitória. In the south, dairy farming is practiced, and milk is sold, through cooperatives, in the markets of Rio de Janeiro and Vitória. More recently developed are silviculture and fruit-growing, with use for canned fruit and cellulose production.

The total number of chickens in the state is about 9.2&nbsp;million birds, and that of cattle exceeds 1.8&nbsp;million head. Important reserves of granite are known and used, and extraction of natural gas and oil is increasing. Sands and marbles are also important products of Espírito Santo [[extractivism]].

The state's subsoil is rich in minerals, including oil, with considerable reserves of limestone, marble, manganese, ilmenite, bauxite, zirconium, monazites, and rare earths, although not all are being explored. In mineral extraction, exploration of reserves of marbles, limestone, and dolomite is happening in the Cachoeiro de Itapemirim area.

Although relatively small, the industrial park in Espírito Santo is home to chemical, metallurgical, food, and paper and cellulose industries.

About [[Industrial sector|industry]], Espírito Santo in 2017 had an industrial GDP of R$21.3&nbsp;billion, equivalent to 1.8% of the national industry. It employed 168,357 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: extraction of oil and natural gas (23.0%), construction (20.5%), industrial services of public utility, such as electricity and water (12.3%), metallurgy (7.5 %), and pulp and paper (6.6%). These sectors concentrate 69.9% of the state's industry.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://perfildaindustria.portaldaindustria.com.br/estado/es |title=Espírito Santo Industry Profile |website=portaldaindustria.com.br |publisher= |language= |date= |access-date=}}</ref>

In 2012, the export basket of Espírito Santo was based on iron ore (52.49%), crude oil (10.87%), chemical pulp made of soda or sulphate wood (10.01%), stone or construction (5.58%), and coffee (4.42%). Espírito Santo exports iron produced in Minas Gerais.

In the mineral extractive industry, in 2019, Rio de Janeiro was the largest producer of oil and natural gas in Brazil, with 71% of the total volume produced. São Paulo comes in second place, with an 11.5% share of total production. Espírito Santo was the third-largest producer state, with 9.4%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibp.org.br/observatorio-do-setor/snapshots/pib-do-estado-do-rio-de-janeiro/ |title=Composição do PIB do estado do Rio de Janeiro |website=ibp.org.br |publisher= |language=pt-BR |access-date= |archive-date=14 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614150947/https://www.ibp.org.br/observatorio-do-setor/snapshots/pib-do-estado-do-rio-de-janeiro/ |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anp.gov.br/noticias/5601-rio-aumenta-participacao-producao-nacional-petroleo-gas |website=anp.gov.br |title=Rio aumenta sua participação na produção nacional de petróleo e gás |language=pt-BR |publisher= |date= |access-date= |archive-date=27 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027213543/http://www.anp.gov.br/noticias/5601-rio-aumenta-participacao-producao-nacional-petroleo-gas |url-status=dead}}</ref> In recent years, Espírito Santo has stood out in the production of oil and natural gas. With several discoveries made, mainly by Petrobras, the state left the fifth position in the Brazilian ranking of reserves, in 2002, to become one of the largest oil province in the country, with total reserves of 2.5&nbsp;billion barrels. About 140 thousand barrels a day are produced. Oil fields are located both on land and at sea, in shallow, deep, and ultra-deep waters, containing light and heavy oil and unassociated gas.

In the urban centers of the capital and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, practically all the main units of the Espírito Santo transformation industry are concentrated. The steel industries are located in the capital Vitória: Companhia Ferro e Aço de Vitória, iron ore pelletizing plant of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce; lumber, textiles, crockery, instant coffee, chocolates and refrigerators. In the Itapemirim river valley, cement, sugar and alcohol, and canned fruit industries are developed.

The 10 largest industrial companies in Espírito Santo are: [[Vale (company)|Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]] (mining), [[ArcelorMittal]] Tubarão (steel mill), Samarco Mineração (mining), [[Aracruz Celulose]], Fertilizers Heringer, [[ArcelorMittal]] Sul Fluminense (steel mill), Escelsa (electricity distribution company), [[Garoto]] (the largest chocolate factory in Latin America and the most important industrial food company of the state) and Sol Coqueria. Espírito Santo is a major steel producer, due to two steel mills present in its territory: ArcelorMittal Tubarão (formerly [[Companhia Siderúrgica de Tubarão]]) in the capital Vitória, which in 2018 produced 7 million tons of crude steel of the 35.4&nbsp;million produced in the country; and ArcelorMittal Sul Fluminense (formerly [[Votorantim Siderurgia]]), also in the capital, which produced 1 million tons of crude steel in the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://institutoacobrasil.net.br/site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AcoBrasil_Mini_anuario_2019.pdf |title=A Siderurgia em Números 2019 |website=institutoacobrasil.net.br |publisher= |date= |page=11 |language=pt-BR |access-date=}}</ref>

In the paper and cellulose sector, Brazilian pulp production was 19.691&nbsp;million tons in 2019. The country exported US$7.48&nbsp;billion in pulp this year, $3.25&nbsp;billion only to China. Brazilian forest-based industry exports totaled $9.7&nbsp;billion ($7.48&nbsp;billion in cellulose, $2&nbsp;billion in paper, and $265&nbsp;million in wood panels). Paper production was 10.535&nbsp;million tons in 2019. The country exported 2.163&nbsp;million tons. In 2016, the paper and cellulose industry in the south of the country represented 33% of the national total. Espírito Santo stands out in this sector. In 2018, $920&nbsp;million were traded in the sale of cellulose to the foreign market, the third-strongest Espírito Santo product in the export balance. In 2016, the top five states producing logs for paper and cellulose (mainly [[eucalyptus]]) were: Paraná (15.9 million m<sup>3</sup>), [[São Paulo]] (14.7&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup>), Bahia (13.6&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup>), Mato Grosso do Sul (9.9&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup>), and [[Minas Gerais]] (7.8&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup>). Together, they correspond to 72.7% of the national production of 85.1&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup>. Espírito Santo, 9th place, had a production of 4.1&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup>. São Mateus, north of Espírito Santo, was the best-city in the Southeast, as the sixth-largest producer of roundwood for paper and cellulose in the country. The 10 largest producing municipalities had 22.9% of the country's production. They were the cities of Telêmaco Borba (PR), Três Lagoas (MS), Caravelas (BA), Mucuri (BA), Ortigueira (PR), São Mateus (ES), Dom Eliseu (PR), Nova Viçosa (BA), Water Clara (MS), and Ribas do Rio Pardo (MS).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.folhavitoria.com.br/economia/noticia/09/2019/made-in-espirito-santo-celulose-capixaba-e-usada-em-papel-ate-do-outro-lado-do-mundo |title=Made in Espírito Santo: celulose capixaba é usada em papel até do outro lado do mundo |website=folhavitoria.com.br |publisher= |date=18 September 2019 |language=pt-BR |access-date=}}</ref><ref name="globoES">{{cite web |url=https://g1.globo.com/espirito-santo/noticia/sao-mateus-e-o-6-maior-produtor-de-madeira-em-tora-para-papel-e-celulose-no-pais-diz-ibge.ghtml |title=São Mateus é o 6º maior produtor de madeira em tora para papel e celulose no país, diz IBGE |language=pt-BR |website=globo.com |publisher= |date=28 September 2017 |access-date=}}</ref>

The tertiary sector is underdeveloped throughout the state, but commercial activity acquires a certain importance with iron ore exports from Minas Gerais, through the Vitória a Minas Railway, and is shipped at the ports of Atalaia and Ponta do Tubarão. The connection of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim to the city of Rio de Janeiro, though, by paved highway, allowed the incorporation of the region into the Rio de Janeiro milk basin and facilitated the export of agricultural products, such as coffee, corn, manioc, rice, and vegetables.

The state's tourist activity is concentrated on the coast, where beaches, such as Itaúnas and Guarapari, are popular. The peak of Bandeira, the third-highest in the country, is another tourist destination. Lately, a new type of tourism has gained prominence: gastronomic, in which typical ''capixaba'' cuisine, heir to different cultures, is appreciated.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The road system is organized from the BR-101, which crosses Espírito Santo from north to south, bordering the coast. The state has 30,100 km of highways, but only 10% are paved.

===Tourism===

Tourism plays an ever-increasing role in the state's economy and is a leading destination in Brazilian [[domestic tourism]], although international tourism is present, though rarer. Tourist destinations include coastal areas such as Guarapari, [[Jacaraípe, Espírito Santo|Jacaraípe]], and [[Manguinhos, Espírito Santo|Manguinhos]], and mountain retreats such as Domingos Martins. Guarapari is also a local tourist destination, known for its black sand beaches. Coastal cuisine is an attraction, with ''moqueca capixaba'' and other local seafood dishes among traditional offerings. Inland, there are many natural attractions, such as the national parks of [[Pedra Azul National Park|Pedra Azul]] and [[Caparaó National Park|Caparaó]].

===Transportation===

====Port====
[[Image:Terceira_Ponte_(2).jpg|thumb|[[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]]'s port entrance under the [[Third Bridge]] (the second-tallest bridge in Brazil), with Ilha do Boi and Camburi Beach in the background]]
The port of Vitória is the most difficult to access among Brazilian ports. The bay on which it is located is extremely narrow with rocks, reefs and mountains, making it challenging for freighters and maritime cruisers to reach the [[Dock (maritime)|docks]]. This narrow approach also results in ships passing closely to population centers. In Vitória, ships sail in close proximity to cars and pedestrians. The location of the port in the city center also results in scheduling complications with limitations resulting from traffic constraints. Currently, the main use of the port is for ship and oil-platform repairs as well as international shipping.

====Airports====
[[File:Novo_Aeroporto_de_VIX.png|thumb|left|Vitória International Airport]]
[[Eurico de Aguiar Salles Airport]], which serves Vitória, is located on just over {{cvt|5200|ha|acre}}. Since construction of its first section, finished in 1946, the airport has undergone several expansions and modernizations, but current demand has surpassed its capacity of 560,000 passengers a year. The passenger terminal has a constructed area of nearly {{cvt|4000|m2|sqft}}, a check-in concourse, 25 check-in counters and boarding and arrival lounges. The recent construction of new aircraft parking boxes on the [[airport apron|apron]]s has increased the airport's operational efficiency.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In 2003, more than 1.2&nbsp;million passengers used the airport, and in 2004 this rose to some 1.25&nbsp;million. Vitória is one of the 32 airports in the [[Infraero]] network that has a cargo terminal. In May 1999, the first direct international freight connection to the United States began operating in Vitória, facilitating American imports to the state of Espírito Santo. As of 2018, there are five such flights per week. A new runway and terminal were due at the end of 2007, but several budget inconsistencies were found and construction was halted.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Flag==
{{See also|Flag of Espírito Santo|List of Espírito Santo state symbols}}
The [[flag]] of Espírito Santo is a horizontal [[Triband (flag)|triband]] of blue, white, and pink, with the [[state motto]], ''Trabalha e Confia'' (English: "Work and trust <nowiki>[</nowiki>God<nowiki>]</nowiki>"), written across the middle band. This motto is a truncated version of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] motto "work as if everything depended on you, and trust as if everything depended on God", well spread by Spanish Catholic [[missionary]] [[José de Anchieta]], and was chosen by [[Jerônimo de Sousa Monteiro|Jerônimo Monteiro]], who was [[governor of Espírito Santo]] from 1908 to 1912. The flag was designed in 1908, with colours inspired by those of [[Our Lady of Victory]] ({{Langx|pt|Nossa Senhora da Vitória}}), the state's [[patron saint]], wearing traditional Portuguese clothing. It is one of the few flags in the world to use pink.<ref>{{cite web |title=Significado das cores da bandeira capixaba |url=https://www.capixabadagema.com.br/qual-o-significado-das-cores-da-bandeira-capixaba/ |website=capixabadagema.com.br |publisher= |date=16 June 2017 |language=pt-BR |access-date=}}</ref>
