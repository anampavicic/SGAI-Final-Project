'''Broken Arrow''' is a city in [[Tulsa County, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] and [[Wagoner County, Oklahoma|Wagoner]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oklahoma]]. It is the largest suburb of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]. According to the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], Broken Arrow has a population of 113,540 residents and is the [[List of municipalities in Oklahoma|4th most populous city]] in the state.<ref name="2010census">{{cite web |url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn33.html |author=US Census Bureau |title=U.S. Census Bureau Delivers Oklahoma's 2010 Census Population Totals |access-date=2010-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219012252/http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn33.html |archive-date=2011-02-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city is part of the [[Tulsa Metropolitan Area]], which has a population of 1,023,988 residents.

The [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]] sold lots for the town site in 1902 and company secretary William S. Fears named it Broken Arrow.<ref name="History of Broken Arrow">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/brokenarrow.html |title=History of Broken Arrow, OK |publisher=Tulsaokhistory.com |access-date=2015-07-26}}</ref> The city was named for a Creek community settled by [[Creek (people)|Creek]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who had been forced to relocate from [[Alabama]] to Oklahoma along the [[Trail of Tears]].

Although Broken Arrow was originally an agricultural community, its current economy is diverse. The city has the third-largest concentration of manufacturers in the state.<ref name="bacommerce">{{cite news|url=http://www.brokenarrowchamber.com/quick_facts.php#industry|title=Broken Arrow Chamber of Commerce; Quick Facts|publisher=Brokenarrowchamber.com|access-date=2008-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505222941/http://www.brokenarrowchamber.com/quick_facts.php#industry|archive-date=2010-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
The city's name comes from an old [[Muscogee|Creek]] community in Alabama.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brokenarrowok.gov/index.aspx?nid=131 |title=Broken Arrow, OK - Official Website - History of Broken Arrow |publisher=City of Broken Arrow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508201538/http://www.brokenarrowok.gov/index.aspx?NID=131 |archive-date=2015-05-08 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Members of that community were expelled from Alabama by the United States government, along the [[Trail of Tears]] in the 1830s. The Creek founded a new community in the [[Indian Territory]] and named it after their old settlement in Alabama. The town's name in the [[Muscogee language]] was Rekackv ({{IPA|mus|ɬiˌkaːtʃkə|pron}}), meaning "broken arrow". The new Creek settlement was located several miles south of present-day downtown Broken Arrow.

The community of Elam, located in present-day Broken Arrow near 145th East Avenue and 111th Street, began around 1901. It consisted of a cluster of stores, a [[cotton gin]], and a few homes.<ref name=library>{{Cite web|url=https://cdm16063.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16063coll1/id/14775/rec/5 |title=Tulsa County Historic Sites :: Tulsa and Oklahoma History Collection |page=Broken Arrow |no-pp=true |website=Tulsa City-County Library Digital Collection |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

In 1902 the [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]] planned a railroad through the area and was granted town site privileges along the route.<ref name="History of Broken Arrow"/> They sold three of the as-yet-unnamed sites to the Arkansas Valley Town Site Company. William S. Fears, secretary of that company, was allowed to choose and name one of the locations. He selected a site about {{convert|18|mi}} southeast of Tulsa and about five miles north of the thlee-Kawtch-kuh settlement and named the new townsite Broken Arrow, after the Indian community.<ref name=library /> The MKT railroad, which was completed in 1903, ran through the middle of the city. It still exists today and is now owned by [[Union Pacific]] which currently uses it for freight.

For the first decades of Broken Arrow's history, the town's economy was based mainly on agriculture.<ref name="wise">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=BR019|title=Broken Arrow |last=Wise |first=Donald A. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref> The coal industry also played an important role, with several strip coal mines located near the city in the early 20th century. The city's newspaper, the [[The Broken Arrow Ledger|''Broken Arrow Ledger'']], started within a couple of years of the city's founding. Broken Arrow's first school was built in 1904.<ref name="wise"/> The city did not grow much during the first half of the 1900s. During this time Broken Arrow's main commercial center was along Main Street. Most of the city's churches were also located on or near Main Street as well. A 1907 government census listed Broken Arrow's population at 1,383.<ref>U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Census of Population: 1920 (Washington, 1921), Vol. 1, p. 579.</ref>

The Haskell State School of Agriculture opened in the Broken Arrow, Oklahoma Opera House on November 15, 1909. The school closed in 1917 for lack of funding, and the building was then used as Broken Arrow High School. The building was razed in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brokenarrowok.gov/Index.aspx?page=255 |title=Historical Sites of Broken Arrow |publisher=City of Broken Arrow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005075534/http://www.brokenarrowok.gov/Index.aspx?page=255 |archive-date=October 5, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Only a marker remains at 808 East College Street in Broken Arrow. The front of cornerstone reads, "Haskell State School / Of Agriculture / J. H. Esslinger Supt. / W. A. Etherton Archt. / Bucy & Walker Contr." The side of cornerstone reads "Laid by the Masonic Fraternity / May 25, A. D. 1910, A. L. 5810. / George Huddell G. M. / Erected by The State Board of Agriculture / J. P. Conners Pres. / B. C. Pittuck Dean.". The school is commemorated on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the 1960s, Broken Arrow began to grow from a small town into a suburban city. The Broken Arrow Expressway ([[Oklahoma State Highway 51]]) was constructed in the mid-1960s and connected the city with downtown Tulsa, fueling growth in Broken Arrow. The population swelled from a little above 11,000 in 1970 to more than 50,000 in 1990, and then more than 74,000 by the year 2000. During this time, the city was more of a bedroom community. In recent years, city leaders have pushed for more economic development to help keep more citizens of Broken Arrow working, shopping, and relaxing in town rather than going to other cities.

===Downtown redevelopment===
[[Image:Historic house Broken Arrow Oklahoma.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Historic 1904 Victorian home on Main Street in downtown BA that has been converted into a business (July 2007)]]
In 2005, the city adopted a downtown revitalization master plan to help revive the city's historic downtown area. Some of the plans include a new 3-story museum to house the historical society and genealogical society, a farmer's market and plaza, a new performing arts center, updates and expansions to area parks, the conversion of the historic Central Middle School on Main Street into a professional development center, infrastructure, and landscape improvements, and incentives to encourage denser infill, redevelopment, and reuse of the area's historic structures. Numerous buildings and homes have since been renovated, many new shops and offices have moved to downtown, and new townhomes are being built. The new historical museum, farmers market, and performing arts center opened in 2008.

The city also sets strict new design standards in place that all new developments in the downtown area must adhere to. These standards were created to prevent "suburban" development in favor of denser, "urban" development, and to ensure that new structures complement and fit in with the historic buildings downtown. In October 2012 Downtown Broken Arrow's main street corridor was named the Rose District.<ref>[http://www.brokenarrowok.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=79] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104232810/http://www.brokenarrowok.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=79|date=November 4, 2012}}</ref>
