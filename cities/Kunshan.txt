==Name==
There is a strong possibility that the name Kunshan is derived from a hill, but which one is controversial.{{sfnp|Wang|1990|pp=73–74}} According to an impacted version,{{clarify|date=December 2017}} the hill is present-day Little Kunshan (''Xiaokunshan'') in Shanghai's [[Songjiang District]]. The character {{lang|zh|崑}} (''Kun'') was the [[old Chinese]]{{dubious|date=July 2018}} name for the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. From it developed the [[chengyu|Chinese idiom]] "a jade from Kunlun Mountains", meaning any "outstanding figure". This was applied to [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]] and a hill in his hometown was designated as Kun to commemorate him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%AE%80%E5%8F%B2%E6%96%B9%E8%BC%BF%E7%B4%80%E8%A6%81/%E5%8D%B7%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E5%9B%9B |script-title=zh:讀史方輿紀要, Vol. 24 |quote={{lang|zh-hant|崑山，府西北二十三里。其西為長谷，亦曰華亭谷，有水縈繞百餘里，為泖湖之上源，故泖湖亦兼谷泖之名。杜佑曰：「華亭縣以華亭谷而名。」陸機臨命嘆曰：「華亭鶴唳，可復聞乎？」蓋其地嘗出鶴也。山之得名，亦以陸機兄弟生於此，取崑山出玉之義}}}}</ref>

[[File:Du Halde - Description de la Chine - Villes de la province de Kiang nan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Maps of "Koen-chan-hien" and other towns of "Kiang-nan" from [[Du Halde]]'s 1736 ''[[Description of China]]'', based on accounts by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]]]]
Lou county ({{lang|zh-hant|婁縣}}) which administered Kunshan and the area around was established in Qin dynasty. It was named after Lou River ({{lang|zh-hant|婁江}}; present-day Liu River: {{lang|zh-hant|瀏河}}), while its seat was located in the north eastern of Kunshan. In 507, Xinyi county ({{lang|zh-hant|信義縣}}) which hold Lou county 's former seat was separated from the old Lou county. In 535, the old Kunshan county was separated from the old Xinyi county, while its seat was moved to the north of Kun Hill, Songjiang. In 751, the seat was moved to the south of Ma'anshan (Ma'an Hill: {{lang|zh-hant|馬鞍山}}; in Kunshan nowadays).
In 1724, then Kunshan county was divided into new Kunshan county and Xinyang county ({{lang|zh-hant|新陽縣}}), the walled city also was halved to locate their own seat respectively. In 1860, Taiping Rebellions captured the walled city, then the Ever Victorious Army recaptured it in 1863.
On 11 November 1911, the local rally announced that both of the counties seceded from the Qing court from then on. In 1912, Xinyang county was merged into Kunshan county. On 15 November 1937, the Japanese army captured the walled city. On 13 May 1949, the CPC controlled the walled city.{{sfnp|Wang|1990|pp=11–68}} On 28 September 1989, the county was turn into a county-level city.

On July 10, 2018, the [[Jiangsu]] Provincial Government approved the Master Plan of Kunshan for Urban Development (2017-2035), which is based on the master plan of the Xiong’an New Area. These zones include the Qingyang Port Waterfront City Center, the Duke Creative Park, the Kunshan South Gateway, the Chaoyang Road CBD and the Tinglin Park Traditional Culture Zone—in addition to the S1 Rail Line Corridor.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://en.savills.com.cn/_news/article/37198/168900-0/9/2018/kunshan-releases-%E2%80%9Cfive-zones--one-line%E2%80%9D-plan-for-urban-renewal|title=Kunshan releases "Five Zones, One Line" plan for urban renewal|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>

'''Qingyang Port Waterfront City Center'''<ref name=":0" />

Covering an area of 3.4 sq km, the area is located in Kunshan’s city center. Planned as an ecological, cultural and smart area, it will include six zones—a media port, a cultural oasis, an urban lifestyle community, a waterfront park, a futuristic life experience center, and a youth entrepreneurship park. The area is designed to be a waterfront space that will enrich and diversify citizens’ urban life as the most environmentally attractive and economically prosperous hub in the city.

'''Duke Creative Park'''<ref name=":0" />

The park is located west of the city’s technology innovation cluster, covering an area of 3.84 sq km. It sits nearby three lakes, two industrial parks, and a town. With the support of [[Duke Kunshan University]], the area will host the Sino-US (Kunshan) Technology Innovation Center and serve as a mixed-used project integrating R&D centers, business services, and an [[Kunshan Forest Park|ecological park]]. It aims to become a global magnet for technology entrepreneurs and innovators.

'''Kunshan South Gateway'''<ref name=":0" />

The area is located around the city’s [[Kunshan South railway station|high-speed railway station]], with an area of 1.6 sq km. While serving as a transportation hub integrating high-speed trains, rail transportation, and public buses, the area will develop businesses such as office spaces for lease, business services and recruitment agencies. As an open, innovative modern gateway, the area will become an important business cluster in the inter-city economic belt of Shanghai and [[Nanjing]].

'''Chaoyang Road CBD'''<ref name=":0" />

The CBD covers an area of 5.55 sq km in the old city center of Kunshan. The area will be furnished with enhanced amenities and infrastructure according to a plan featuring “one ring, two axes, three centers and four zones”. The project aims to revive and transform the old city center into an exquisite and livable model business district.

'''Tinglin Park Traditional Culture Zone'''<ref name=":0" />

The zone is located at the foot of Yufeng Mountain, with a planned area of 0.73 sq km. It is designed with cultural and art parks, culture-oriented businesses and ecological and leisure facilities. It will epitomize the natural beauty and cultural richness of the city.

'''S1 Rail Line Corridor'''<ref name=":0" />

[[Line S1 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|The line]] is 41&nbsp;km long and will be completely constructed underground with 28 stops. The line will pass by all the major zones of the city and will significantly alleviate local traffic congestion. The project will be integrated with the surface transportation system and serve as a strong boost to the city’s renewal.
