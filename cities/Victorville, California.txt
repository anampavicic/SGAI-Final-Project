'''Victorville''' is a city in [[Victor Valley]] in [[San Bernardino County, California]]. Its population as of the 2020 census was 134,810.<ref name=quif/>

Victorville is the principal city of a Victor Valley–based [[urban area]] defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]]: the Victorville–[[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]]–[[Apple Valley, California|Apple Valley]] urban area had a population of 355,816 as of the 2020 census, making it the [[List of United States urban areas|117th largest in the United States]].<ref name="urban area">{{cite web |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/29/2022-28286/2020-census-qualifying-urban-areas-and-final-criteria-clarifications|title=2020 Census Qualifying Urban Areas and Final Criteria Clarifications|author=United States Census Bureau|website=Federal Register|date=December 29, 2022}}</ref>

==History==
The [[Serrano people]] were the first Native Americans to inhabit the area.<ref>{{cite book|title=Victorville| isbn=9781467129985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ys7CB-OZ1v0C&q=Victorville+history | last1=Almendral | first1=Dylan M. | date=September 19, 2023 | publisher=Arcadia }}</ref>

In 1858, Aaron G. Lane came to what is now known as Victorville and founded a waystation called "Lane's Crossing." For many years it provided shelter and supplies for people journeying across the desert from the east to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]. Lane's Crossing was on the [[Mojave River]] on today's Turner Road, two miles north of where [[Interstate 15 in California|Interstate 15]] crosses the river. Lane was a veteran of the [[Mexican–American War]] who had had malaria during that war. Originally he migrated west to join the [[California gold rush]], but he learned that he could make a better living selling supplies to the miners.

Lane settled in [[Ione, California|Ione]], near [[Sutter's Mill]] in northern California, during those years, but migrated to San Bernardino in 1857. He settled on the Mojave River in 1858, where he established his waystation. He later sold out to Texan John Fry Miller, who changed the name of Lane's Crossing to Pioneer Station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mojavedesert.net/history/pioneer/lanes-crossing-01.html |title=Lane'S Crossing |publisher=Mojavedesert.net |access-date=November 4, 2013}}</ref> Miller was a rancher and became involved in Mojave Valley politics, setting up the first polling place in the area at his home. That first year, ten citizens cast their votes at Lane's residence rather than making the long trip to San Bernardino.<ref>{{cite web |author=Thompson, Richard D. and Kathryn L. |title=Pioneer of the Mojave: The Life and Times of Aaron G. Lane |url=http://mojavehistory.com/lane1.html |access-date=December 2, 2008 |publisher=MojaveHistory.com }}</ref>

Census records show that ten people lived in two residences on the river by 1860. Listed in Dwelling No. 703 were Aaron Lane, William R. Levick, and the Nicholson family, consisting of George, Frances, and their three children aged 9 to 13. Joseph and Mary Highmoor lived in Dwelling No. 704, with a seven-year-old girl named Anna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mojavedesert.net/history/pioneer/lanes-crossing-03.html |title=A Settlement On The Mojave |publisher=Mojavedesert.net |access-date=November 4, 2013}}</ref>

The Levick, Nicholson and Highmoor families were Mormon pioneers. Highmoor established a way station called Highmoor's Crossing near today's Oro Grande bridge of the National Trails Highway (known as [[U.S. Route 66]]), over the Mojave River at what is called the Lower Narrows. The Nicholson family moved downriver a few miles and established a way station at "Point of Rocks" in today's Helendale area.

In 1867, Lafayette Meacham, a Mormon who ran a way station near today's Barstow area, made a new wagon road from his stage stop to what is now Old Town Victorville. It crossed the Mojave River at today's Sixth Street. This new road, now called Stoddard Wells Road, was a shortcut across the desert and became a popular route for muleskinners and freighters. The river crossing was called Mormon Crossing and the surrounding area became known by that name.

In the 1870s, Heber "Pete" Huntington established a stage stop, Huntington Station, at Mormon Crossing. Also a Mormon pioneer, Huntington was leader [[Brigham Young]]'s nephew. Huntington later bought out the Stoddard brothers, who had a waystation halfway to today's Barstow from Victorville, and the Meachams, who ran the stage stop named Fish Ponds or Mormon Grocery.

In 1885, the newly established telegraph station at the railroad siding of "Victor", named for the [[California Southern Railroad]]'s General Manager [[Jacob Nash Victor]], was the beginning of what developed as today's Old Town Victorville. The village that sprang up around that railroad facility became known by the same name of Victor.

In 1901, at the suggestion of local postmistress Abbey Turner, the [[U.S. Post Office Department]] changed that name to Victorville to stop the postal confusion with the town of [[Victor, Colorado]].

In 1926, U.S. Route 66 was begun, being marked in many areas on existing roads. In Victorville, US 66 is marked on D and Seventh streets, with a section of Interstate 15 going towards the Cajon Pass. It is the primary street through Old Town Victorville.

In 1940, [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and [[John Houseman]] wrote the first two drafts of the [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay]] for the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' in Victorville. They worked in seclusion for 12 weeks while residing at the North Verde Ranch, now called the Kemper Campbell Ranch.<ref name=Lebo>{{cite book |last=Lebo |first=Harlan |title=Citizen Kane: The Fiftieth Anniversary Album |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=New York |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-385-41473-9}}</ref>{{Rp|32}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mojavehistory.com/interviewcampbelldeblasis.html |title=Joseph Campbell and Jean De Blasis Interview  |website=Mohave Historical Society Oral Histories |publisher=Mojave Desert History |access-date=February 4, 2016}}</ref> The quiet ranch allowed Mankiewicz to complete his writing without the temptation of drinking, as he struggled with alcoholism.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lindstrom|first=Natasha|date=December 20, 2011|title='Citizen Kane' penned on quiet Victorville ranch|language=en|website=vvdailypress.com|publisher=[[Gannett]]|url=https://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20111219/NEWS/312199997|access-date=May 13, 2021}}</ref>

The [[Victorville Army Airfield]] was constructed beginning in 1941. It was renamed the [[George Air Force Base]] when the [[U.S. Air Force]] was established in October 1947. After decades of service to the Air Force, in 1992 George Air Force Base was closed. Its land was turned over to other uses. Part of it is now the [[Southern California Logistics Airport]]. The former Air Force base housing area is now vacant. It forms a ghost town used for military training by troops from the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[Fort Irwin Military Reservation]]. The [[United States Penitentiary, Victorville|Victorville Federal Penitentiary]] has been built on another part of the former air base.

The city of Victorville was officially incorporated by the State of California on September 21, 1962.

In 2003, the [[Roy Rogers]] and Dale Evans Museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royrogers.com/museum.html|title=Museum is now CLOSED...Disregard all info below|website=www.royrogers.com|access-date=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317135421/http://www.royrogers.com/museum.html|archive-date=March 17, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> was moved from Victorville to [[Branson, Missouri]]. It closed before 2015.

On November 3, 2007, Victorville hosted the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]], a six-hour autonomous robot driving contest through the streets of the Southern California Logistics Airport. The $2 million first prize went to the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/darpa-urban-challenge|title=DARPA Urban Challenge}}</ref>

==Geography==
Victorville is located at the southwestern edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], {{convert|81|mi|km}} northeast of [[Los Angeles]], {{convert|148|mi|km}} north of [[San Diego]], {{convert|188|mi|km}} southwest of [[Las Vegas]], {{convert|32|mi|km}} south of [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], {{convert|48|mi|km}} east of [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], and {{convert|36|mi|km}} north of [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] through the [[Cajon Pass]] on [[Interstate 15 in California|Interstate 15]]. Victorville is the location of offices of the "Mojave Desert Branch" of the San Bernardino County government.

Victorville is bordered by [[Apple Valley, California|Apple Valley]] on the east, [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] on the south, and [[Adelanto]] on the west. The [[Mojave River]] flows sporadically through Victorville. The elevation at City Hall is approximately {{convert|2950|ft|m}} above sea level.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|73.7|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|73.2|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is water. The total area is 0.76% water.

===Climate===
The city is in the [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]], an area known for its unique and moderate weather patterns. The [[National Weather Service]] has maintained a weather station in Victorville since 1917. Official records show that Victorville has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climate|cool arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk'') with four distinct seasons. Due to the higher elevation and inland location of the High Desert, the climate tends to be more extreme than in the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and other Southern California lowland regions.

Winter is the region's wet season, when Victorville receives the most storms. Due to the [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] and [[San Gabriel Mountains]], the rainfall received is less than in the Los Angeles basin or even the San Bernardino Valley. Temperatures tend to be cool, with overnight low temperatures dropping to or below freezing on average. While the high temperatures average around a pleasant {{convert|60|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}, there are periods in which the high temperature fails to reach {{convert|50|°F|°C}} or even {{convert|45|°F|°C|1}}. Low temperatures can dip below {{convert|25|°F|°C|1}} on occasion, with very cold temperatures possible; the record lowest temperature was {{convert|-1|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20190102/socal-chills-ahead-of-weekend-storm|title=SoCal chills ahead of weekend storm |publisher=Victor Valley News|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> Snowfall and other wintry precipitation is also possible, although any snowfall tends to be very light and melt quickly; significant snowstorms as seen in the San Bernardino Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains are very rare.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20180226/winter-comes-for-high-desert-region-to-see-rain-snow-at-2500-foot-level|title=Winter comes for High Desert: Region to see rain, snow at 2,500-foot level |publisher=Victor Valley News|date=February 26, 2018|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20190221/victor-valley-awakens-to-snow|title=Victor Valley awakens to snow|publisher=Victor Valley News|date=February 21, 2019|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> [[Black ice]] is also possible during the winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vvng.com/black-ice-causing-accidents-victor-valley/ |title=Black Ice Causing Accidents In the Victor Valley |publisher=Victor Valley News|date=January 24, 2017|access-date=April 2, 2017}}</ref>

Summer days are generally hot to sweltering, with average high temperatures approaching {{convert|100|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}. It is also the time of year in which Victorville, and Southern California as a whole, receives the least precipitation. The higher elevation prevents the temperatures from matching the extreme heat seen in lower desert cities such as [[Palm Springs, California#Climate|Palm Springs]] or [[Needles, California#Climate|Needles]]. However, heat waves can still raise the temperature to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}, with the all-time record high being {{convert|116|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20180703/heat-wave-ushering-in-sizzling-temps-high-of-110-degrees-friday-prompts-excessive-heat-watch|title=Heat wave ushering in sizzling temps: High of 110 degrees Friday prompts Excessive Heat Watch|publisher=Victor Valley News|date=July 3, 2018|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> Also unlike lower desert communities, the [[diurnal temperature variation]] is greater, allowing substantial relief to occur at night with average low temperatures approaching {{convert|60|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}. In the later part of the season, the average precipitation amount experiences an uptick due to the [[North American Monsoon]] bringing possible thunderstorms to the region. These thunderstorms can cause flash flooding, lightning, hail, and bring relief from the very hot summer days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20150730/NEWS/150739976|title=Some parts of High Desert get more rain|publisher=Victor Valley News|date=July 30, 2015|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2018/08/16/flash-flood-watch-issued-for-parts-of-socal-including-recent-burn-areas/|title=Flooding, Lightning, Hail and Funnel Clouds: Summer Storm Brings Wild Weather to Parts of SoCal|publisher=KTLA|date=August 16, 2018|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

Spring is a transitional season, with warm high temperatures and low temperatures remaining quite cool. Summer-like weather usually begins to appear in May while rainfall tapers off. Autumn also has generally warm to very warm high temperatures on average, with temperatures falling from hot in September to pleasant in November, and rainfall rates increasing. Winter-like weather usually begins to appear by late November. High wind events are common in Victorville year-round and particularly during the spring; they can down power lines and cause dust storms that reduce visibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20170330/high-winds-sweep-through-high-desert-causing-havoc|title=High winds sweep through High Desert, causing havoc|publisher=Victor Valley News|date=March 30, 2017|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

There are an average of 109 days with highs of {{convert|90|°F|°C|1}} or higher and an average of 79 days with lows of {{convert|32|°F|°C}} or lower. The average annual rainfall in Victorville is {{convert|6.27|in|mm}}. There is an average of 28 days annually with measurable rain. The wettest “rain year” recorded was from July 1982 to June 1983 with {{convert|12.89|in|mm|1}} and the driest from July 1960 to June 1961 with {{convert|1.26|in|mm|1}}. The most precipitation in one month was {{convert|5.45|in|mm|1}} in February 1944. The most precipitation in 24 hours was {{convert|3.00|in|mm|1}} on February 24, 1998. Snowfall in Victorville averages only {{convert|1.4|in|m|sigfig=2|disp=or}} annually. The most snowfall in one month was {{convert|38.0|in|m|2}} in January 1949, including {{convert|31.0|in|m|2}} on January 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca9325 |title=VICTORVILLE, CALIFORNIA – Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=November 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://weatherspark.com/y/1975/Average-Weather-in-Victorville-California-United-States-Year-Round|title=Average Weather in Victorville California, United States|publisher=WeatherSpark|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Old Town Victorville-Veteran's Memorial-Seventh St-Forrest Ave.jpg|thumb|right|Old Town Victorville Veteran's Memorial]]

A revitalization project started in 1995 in the ten square blocks along Historic Route 66. After years of setbacks in developing Old Town, the city, with input from residents and local business owners, created an Old Town Strategic Action Plan in 2007.
