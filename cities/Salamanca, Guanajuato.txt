'''Salamanca''' ([[Otomi language|Otomi]]: ''Xidoo'' "Place of [[Tepetate]]") is a city and municipality in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Guanajuato]].

The city was founded on January 1, 1603, as 'Villa de Salamanca' by the Viceroy [[Gaspar de Zúñiga, 5th Count of Monterrey|Gaspar de Zúñiga]], fifth Count of Monterrey, who was originally from [[Salamanca]] ([[Spain]]). The town was founded in the lands of the [[Bajío]], after cattle ranchers and poor farmers, a few Spaniards, and small groups of [[Otomi people|Otomis]] who formerly occupied a village named Xidoo, already lived in the area.

In recent years, many refineries have opened, and Salamanca has grown rapidly to become an important site for manufacturing and service industry in the region. Also, the University of Guanajuato has made many scientific contributions to develop agricultural and industrial technologies, giving a boost to the local and regional industries.

The city reported a 2020 census population of 160,682. The fourth largest city in the state (behind [[León, Guanajuato|León]], [[Irapuato, Guanajuato|Irapuato]], and [[Celaya, Guanajuato|Celaya]]), it is also the largest of four places called "Salamanca" in Mexico.

==Cuisine==
Salamanca's cuisine is very diverse because, thanks to the oil refinery, it is a city that has people from all over the country, from cities such as [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], [[Oaxaca City|Oaxaca]] and [[Mexico City]]. Each of these cities has its own variety of food, so one can find [[enchilada]]s, wheat gorditas, [[pambazo]], [[hamburger]]s, its famous [[carnitas]] (pulled pork), [[arrachera]], cabrito (goat), [[birria]], barbecue, [[cecina (meat)|cecina]], and pizza.  There are food stands on virtually every street corner. Many types of locally made [[ice pop]]s & [[ice cream]] are also popular in the city.

==Industry==
The [[petrochemical industry]] is the primary one in the city, giving rise to numerous companies and bus transport services available for employees. The strategy was to boost the creation and development of the so-called "industrial corridor" of the Bajio.

The largest [[Pemex]] refinery in Mexico is located in Salamanca, and it is the 11th largest crude oil refinery in the world.<ref>[http://www.seamannewsroom.com/newsreleases/pemex_article.html Mexican Refinery Lines Impoundment With Geomembrane<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816005106/http://www.seamannewsroom.com/newsreleases/pemex_article.html |date=2007-08-16 }}</ref>

Also noteworthy is CFE Thermoelectric, a source of significant employment in the municipality.

In February 2014, [[Mazda]] opened its North American plant outside of Salamanca. At full production, the plant is expected to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year and employ over 4,600 workers. About 30 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States will be sourced from this factory.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/mazda-opens-new-plant-salamanca-mexico|title=Mazda opens new plant in Salamanca, Mexico|newspaper=Autoweek|access-date=2016-12-30}}</ref>

===Air transportation===

However, this project has been stalled for at least 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.am.com.mx/Nota.aspx?ID=135068&strPlaza=Leon&IDPlaza=1 |title=Periódico a.m. - Arrasan con boletos |access-date=2008-10-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716094459/http://www.am.com.mx/Nota.aspx?ID=135068&strPlaza=Leon&IDPlaza=1 |archive-date=2011-07-16 }} Article on the Tren Interurbano's status.
