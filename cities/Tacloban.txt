'''Tacloban''' ({{IPAc-en|t|æ|k|ˈ|l|oʊ|b|ə|n}} {{Respell|tak|LOH|ban}}; {{IPA|tl|tɐkˈloban}}), officially the '''City of Tacloban''' ({{langx|war|Syudad han Tacloban}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Tacloban}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] on [[Leyte]] island in the [[Eastern Visayas]] region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, Tacloban has a population of 251,881, making it the most populous city in the [[Eastern Visayas]].{{PH census|current}}  The city is located {{convert|360|mi|km}} southeast from [[Manila]].

Tacloban is the regional center of the Eastern Visayas region and also the largest city and capital of the province of [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but the city is governed and administered independently from it.

Tacloban City was briefly the capital of the Philippines under the Commonwealth Government, from October 20, 1944, to February 27, 1945. In an extensive survey conducted by the [[Asian Institute of Management]] Policy Center and released in July 2010, Tacloban City ranks as the fifth most competitive city in the Philippines, and second in the emerging cities category.<ref>{{cite web

==Etymology==
The area got its name from the word ''taklub'', a bamboo tray used to catch crabs or shrimp.<ref name="etymology">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://tacloban.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/City-Profile.pdf |website=tacloban.gov.ph |access-date=9 June 2024}}</ref>

==History==
{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2022}}
[[File:TAKLUB.JPG|thumb|left|Street performers carrying ''taklub'' on their backs (Tacloban takes its name from the ''taklub'', a bamboo fish-catching contraption).]]
[[File:Philippine Island - Leyte - NARA - 68155994.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Tacloban, 1931]]

Tacloban was first known as ''Kankabatok'', an allusion to the first inhabitants &ndash; ''Kabatok''. They established their dwellings in the vicinity of the present day [[Santo Niño Church (Tacloban)|Santo Niño Church]]. Others who came later were ''Gumoda'', ''Haraging'' and ''Huraw'' who erected their own settlements in nearby sites. ''Huraw''<nowiki/>'s domain is the hill where the city hall now sits. The combined settlements acquired the name ''Kankabatok'', meaning "property of ''Kabatok{{'}}s''". {{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The constant threat of pirates due to its lack of a natural barrier hindered the development and progress of the settlement.  And so the place never figured out the early centuries of the Spanish colonization of Leyte. When the Jesuits (the first evangelizers of Leyte) left in 1768, the Augustinians took over, and in 1770 they established the barrio with a chapel (visita) of Tacloban under the jurisdiction of Palo.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The Augustinians who came from the Province of the Holy Name of Jesus based in Cebu were also responsible in introducing the devotion to the Santo Niño becoming therefore the heavenly patron of the settlement.  With the Moro raids in check, the place became a hub for commercial activity and soon after the place was renamed Tacloban becoming an independent municipality and then capital of the province of Leyte.  In 1843, the Augustinians ceded the administration of the parish to the Franciscans.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The change of the name came about in this manner: ''Kankabatok'' was a favorite haunt of fishermen.  They would use a bamboo contraption called a ''"taklub"'' to catch crabs, shrimps or fish.<ref name="etymology" /> When asked where they were going, the fishermen would answer, ''"(to) tarakluban"'', which meant the place where they used the device to catch these marine resources. Eventually, the name ''Tarakluban'' or Tacloban took prominence.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

It is not known when Tacloban became a municipality because records supporting this fact were destroyed during a typhoon. It is commonly believed that Tacloban was officially proclaimed a municipality in 1770s. In 1768, Leyte and Samar were separated into two provinces, each constituting a politico-military province. Due to its strategic location, Tacloban became a vital trading point between the two provinces.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The capital of Leyte was transferred from one town to another with Tacloban as the last on February 26, 1830. The decision to make Tacloban the capital was based on the following reasons: 1) ideal location of the port and 2) well-sheltered and adequate facilities. On June 20, 1952, Tacloban was proclaimed a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act No. 760.<ref name=RA760 />

[[File:Madonna of Japan in the Kanfuraw Hill, Tacloban01.JPG|thumb|left|Madonna Maria Kanon, locally called Madonna of Japan, a peace commemoration statue in Kanhuraw Hill]]
The arrival of Colonel Arthur Murray in 1901 made him the first military governor of Leyte. His first official act was the opening of Tacloban port to world commerce. Before [[World War II]], Tacloban was the commercial, education, social and cultural center of the Province of Leyte. [[Copra]] and [[abaca]] were exported in large quantities.

In November 1912, a [[1912 Tacloban typhoon|typhoon]] swept through the central Philippines and "practically destroyed" Tacloban. In Tacloban and [[Capiz]] on the island of [[Panay]], the death toll was 15,000, half the population of those cities at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1912-11-30/ed-1/seq-1/ |title= 15,000 Die in Philippine Storm |newspaper=Washington Herald |date=November 30, 1912 |access-date=November 19, 2013}}</ref>

On May 25, 1942, Japanese forces landed in Tacloban, signalling the beginning of their two-year occupation of Leyte. They fortified the city and improved its airfield. Since San Pedro Bay was ideal for larger vessels, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Imperial Naval Forces]] made Tacloban a port of call and entry. This time was considered the darkest in the history of Tacloban and the country due to the incidences{{verify spelling|date=September 2022|reason=''incidence'' is normally used only in the singular form, perhaps ''incidence'', ''incidents'',  or ''instances'' was intended}} of torture among civilians, including the elderly. In response, guerrilla groups operated in Leyte &ndash; the most notable of which was the group of [[Ruperto Kangleon]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}} The Japanese established a "comfort station" in the city, where they kidnapped local girls, teenagers and young adults who they then forced into becoming sex slaves under the gruesome "[[comfort women]]" system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/29/939811000/philippine-survivor-recounts-her-struggle-as-a-comfort-woman-for-wartime-japan|title=Philippine Survivor Recounts Her Struggle As A 'Comfort Woman' For Wartime Japan|newspaper=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=15 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IsBB-RVTlQC&dq=comfort+gay+philippines+japan&pg=PR9|title=The Other Empire: Literary Views of Japan from the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia|year=2008|publisher=The University of the Philippines Press|isbn=9789715425629|access-date=15 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.awf.or.jp/e1/philippine-00.html | title=Women made to be Comfort Women - Philippines }}</ref>

Leyte was the first to be liberated by the combined Filipino and American troops. [[General Douglas MacArthur]]'s assault troops landed in the Tacloban and Palo beaches (White Beach and Red Beach, respectively) and in the neighboring town of Dulag (Blue Beach) on October 20, 1944. These landings signaled the eventual victory of the Filipino and American forces and the fulfillment of MacArthur's famous promise: "I Shall Return."{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Three days later, on October 23, at a ceremony at the [[Leyte Provincial Capitol|Capitol Building]] in Tacloban, MacArthur, accompanied by President [[Sergio Osmeña]], made Tacloban the temporary seat of the Commonwealth Government and temporary capital of the Philippines until the complete liberation of the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1944/10/23/proclamation-of-general-douglas-macarthur-to-the-people-of-the-philippines-october-23-1944/|title=Proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur to the People of the Philippines, October 23, 1944|date=October 23, 1944|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=February 21, 2018}}</ref> The provincial government of Leyte and the municipal government of Tacloban were re-established.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

On January 8, 1960, MacArthur made his "sentimental" journey to Leyte. He was greeted with cheers by locals when he visited Tacloban.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

88.52% of the residents of Tacloban City are Roman Catholic; 6.12% are [[Islam|Muslim]]s (most are Maranao migrants from Mindanao); 0.83% are of the indigenous Christian denomination, Iglesia ni Cristo; 0.94% are Evangelicals (born-again Christians); Baptists 0.80%; 0.49% Seventh-Day Adventists.

{{PH poverty incidence}}
 
Tacloban is the economic center of the entire [[Eastern Visayas]], with an economy largely focused on agriculture, commerce, and tourism. Proximal to the city proper is the 237-hectare Eastern Visayas Agri-Industrial Growth Center (EVRGC), which was approved and accredited by the [[Philippine Economic Zone Authority]] by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 1210 on April 23, 1998. EVRGC serves as an eco-industrial hub with the Tacloban city government as its developer and operator. Several regional broadcasters are also based in the city including ABS-CBN TV-2 Tacloban, [[DYCL-TV|GMA TV-10 Tacloban]] and PRTV-12 Tacloban. The [[Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport]] also makes the city a key regional transportation hub.

Tacloban is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Philippines, and has one of the lowest poverty incidence rates in the country (at roughly 9%, while the national poverty incidence stands at 30%). After its massive devastation on November 8, 2013, Tacloban was declared by its local government as a ''start-up city'', which means everything had to start back from scratch. Currently the city is experiencing a rapid economic recovery.

[[File:Tacloban City Hall (Magsaysay Blvd., Tacloban, Leyte; 09-08-2022).jpg|thumb|left|''Kanhuraw'' &ndash; this nickname of the Tacloban City Hall is also the name of the hill where the building stands.]]
The executive power of the City Government is vested in the mayor.  The ''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'' or the city council has the legislative power to create city ordinances.  It is a unicameral body composed of ten elected councilors and certain numbers of ex officio and sectoral representatives.  It is presided by the vice mayor, the mayor and the elected city councilors who are elected-at-large every three years. The current city mayor is Alfred Romualdez.

The city government ceased to be under the supervision of the provincial government after it became a highly urbanized city in 2008.  The city is now under the direct supervision of the national government.

Tacloban City is part of the [[Legislative districts of Leyte#1st District|1st District of Leyte]], alongside seven other municipalities: [[Alangalang, Leyte|Alangalang]], [[Babatngon, Leyte|Babatngon]], [[Palo, Leyte|Palo]], [[San Miguel, Leyte|San Miguel]], [[Santa Fe, Leyte|Santa Fe]], [[Tanauan, Leyte|Tanauan]], and [[Tolosa, Leyte|Tolosa]].

This is accompanied by the ritual of giving the medallion containing the names of all Hermanos Pasados and the Standartes. Fireworks and grand parades mark the occasion. Every house in the city prepares a feast and opens its doors to guests and well wishers.

;Subiran Regatta: Subiran Regatta is a race of one-man native sailboats with outriggers locally called "subiran" along scenic and historic [[Leyte Gulf]]. The race is done without using a paddle but only skills and techniques to manoeuvre the sail. The Subiran Regatta is now on its 32nd year and counting. This contest is done annually on that weeklong celebration of the Tacloban City Fiesta. The race aims to preserve the art of sailing with the wind alone, and to showcase the mastery of this art by local boatmen.

[[File:Balyuan Park.jpg|thumb|Plaza Libertad]]
;Balyuan: Organized by the Department of Tourism and the city government, this activity which only started in 1975 is supposedly a re-enactment of a purported exchange of images between Barrio Buscada of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]] and Sitio Kankabatok, now Tacloban City.  A local story which only saw print in the 20th century purports that in the old days, Sitio Kankabatok was a small barrio under the jurisdiction of Basey town in Samar. During the Feast of Santo Niño, the residents of Sitio Kankabatok would borrow the bigger image of the saint from the chapel of Barrio Buscada in Basey. Santo Niño is the revered patron saint of both Kankabatok and Barrio Buscada. The image is returned promptly after the festivities. When Kankabatok grew into a barrio of its own, the local Catholic authorities decided that the bigger Santo Niño image be retained in prospering village. However, because of its highly questionable anthropological and historical basis, the story can be best understood as simply etiological.  It gives witness to the cultural, ethnographical and historical relationship between the people of south Samar and the eastern seaboard of Leyte.  Likewise, stories of the image missing in Buscada and turning up in Kankabatok aided to this decision of honoring this relationship. The Basey Flotilla bearing the church and government leaders goes on a fluvial procession along San Pedro Bay. A budyong (shell) call announces the sight of the flotilla off Kankabatok Bay.

;Sangyaw Festival: [[Sangyaw]] is an archaic Waray word which means to herald the news. The Sangyaw Festival was created by [[Imelda Marcos]] in the 1980s. The festival was revived in 2008 by her nephew, current city mayor Alfred Romualdez. The Sangyaw Festival invites contingents of different performing groups of various festivals in the country to compete in this side of the region. Cash prizes and trophies are at stake as the Sangyaw Festival grooms itself to be a big festival to watch out in the succeeding years.
