Human settlement of the Santa Clarita Valley dates back to the arrival of the [[Chumash people]], who were displaced by the [[Tataviam]] circa 450 AD. After Spanish colonists arrived in [[Alta California]], the [[Rancho San Francisco]] was established, covering much of the Santa Clarita Valley. [[Henry Newhall|Henry Mayo Newhall]] purchased the Rancho San Francisco in 1875 and established the towns of [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]] and [[Newhall, Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]]. The [[Newhall Land and Farming Company]] played a major role in the city's development. In December 1987, the city of Santa Clarita was incorporated, encompassing the communities of [[Canyon Country, Santa Clarita, California|Canyon Country]], Newhall, Saugus, and [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]].<ref name="Boston">{{cite book|last1=Boston|first1=John|author2=Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society|title=Santa Clarita Valley|date=2009 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-0-7385-6938-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N3bO-hXlWWgC&pg=PA124 124]}}</ref> The four communities retain separate identities, and residents commonly refer to one of them when asked where they are from. Santa Clarita is bounded on the west by the [[Interstate 5 in California|Golden State Freeway]] (I-5). The [[California State Route 14|Antelope Valley Freeway]] (CA-14) runs northeast–southwest forming part of the city's irregular east boundary. The two freeways meet at [[Newhall Pass]], near the city's southernmost point.

Santa Clarita is home to three institutions of higher education: [[California Institute of the Arts]], a private art university; [[The Master's University]], a Christian liberal arts university; and [[College of the Canyons]], a community college. Companies headquartered in or near the city include [[Princess Cruises]], [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]], [[Remo]], and the Newhall Land and Farming Company. The unincorporated communities of [[Castaic, California|Castaic]] and [[Stevenson Ranch, California|Stevenson Ranch]], located to the north and west of the Santa Clarita city limits, respectively, are closely associated with the city. [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]], though commonly thought to be in the Valencia part of Santa Clarita, is also west of Interstate 5 and outside of the Santa Clarita city limits.

==Name==
The [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara River]] was named by Spanish explorers for Saint [[Clare of Assisi]]. The valley and the settlement later became known as "little Santa Clara" ("Santa Clarita" in the Spanish diminutive) to distinguish it from the Northern Californian city of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]<ref name="Everett-Heath">{{cite book |last=Everett-Heath |first=John |title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place Names |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-1917-5139-4 |edition=3rd |language=en}}</ref> and its accompanying [[Mission Santa Clara de Asís]]. The [[Santa Clarita Valley]] similarly differentiates itself from the [[Santa Clara Valley]] in Northern California. The region was not widely referred to as Santa Clarita until the 1950s; before this, it was unofficially referred to as the "Newhall–Saugus area" and the "Bonelli tract," after a family that owned land in the valley.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newhall|first=Ruth Waldo|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/scv-name.htm|title=How Santa Clarita Got Its Name|work=Old Town Newhall Gazette|date=February–March 1997|via=SCVHistory.com|access-date=July 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial eras===
The Santa Clarita Valley has been settled for millennia before European arrival. The oldest archaeological site in the area dates back to roughly 3000 BC.<ref name=timeline/> About AD 450, the [[Tataviam people|Tataviam]] arrived, displacing the [[Chumash people]] who previously inhabited the area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Paul|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/higgins-tataviam.htm|title=The Tataviam: Early Newhall Residents|website=scvhistory.com|date=January–February 1996|access-date=February 19, 2021}}</ref> The Tataviam lived in approximately 20 villages in the valley and surrounding areas including [[Piru, California|Piru]], [[Agua Dulce, California|Agua Dulce]], [[Elizabeth Lake, California|Elizabeth Lake]], and [[Tochonanga]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=SCVHistory.com {{!}} Tataviam Culture |url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/tataviam.htm |access-date=December 24, 2022 |website=scvhistory.com |language=en}}</ref>

In the 18th century, Spanish colonists arrived in southern California including Santa Clarita, founding [[Spanish missions in California|mission settlements]]. The [[Mission San Fernando Rey de España|Mission San Fernando]] was founded in 1797 in present-day [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles|Mission Hills]], just {{convert|9.5|mi|km}} south of downtown Newhall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Newhall,+Railroad+Avenue,+Newhall,+Santa+Clarita,+CA/San+Fernando+Mission,+San+Fernando+Mission+Boulevard,+Mission+Hills,+CA/|title=Newhall to San Fernando Mission|publisher=Google Maps|access-date=February 22, 2021}}</ref> In 1822, [[Alta California]], which included most of the present-day southwestern United States including all of California, became a territory of the newly independent country of Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Mary Floyd|title=Mission, presidio and pueblo: Notes on California local institutions under Spain and Mexico|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|date=July 1922|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.2307/25613566|jstor=25613566 |url=https://archive.org/stream/californiahisto1219cali_0#page/n34/mode/1up|access-date=February 25, 2021}}</ref>

The {{convert|48612|acres|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Francisco]] land grant was issued by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], governor of [[Alta California]], to Mexican army officer Antonio del Valle.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg090199a.htm|title=Del Valle descendant pursues her roots|work=Santa Clarita Valley Signal|first=Marci|last=Wormser |date=September 1, 1999|access-date=April 9, 2007}}</ref> It was an agricultural area serving the nearby Mission San Fernando.

===1822–1899: Gold discovery, Mentryville, and Henry Mayo Newhall===
In 1842, Francisco Lopez discovered gold in [[Placerita Canyon State Park|Placerita Canyon]]—the first documented discovery of gold in California. The discovery is commemorated in an 1842 mining claim issued by Governor Alvarado.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Rawls|editor1-first=James|editor2-first=Richard J.|editor2-last=Orsi|title=A golden state: mining and economic development in Gold Rush California|series=California History Sesquicentennial, 2|year=1999 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21771-3|page=3}}</ref> The Oak of the Golden Dream, which marks the site of the discovery, remains an attraction for tourists. Several places throughout Santa Clarita carry the "Golden Oak" name, including Golden Oak Road in Saugus; Golden Oak Lane, Golden Oak Ranch, and Golden Oak Adult School in Newhall; and Golden Oak Community School in Canyon Country.

The United States acquired California in 1848, after winning the [[Mexican–American War]]. The community of Newhall is named after [[Henry Mayo Newhall|Henry Newhall]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newhallfoundation.org/aboutHMN.html |title=About Henry Mayo Newhall |publisher=Henry Mayo Newhall Foundation |year=2000 |access-date=April 20, 2007}}</ref> an American businessman who made his fortune during the [[California Gold Rush]]. He founded the H.M. Newhall & Company, a successful auction house in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Newhall had also invested in rail companies that would connect San Francisco to other cities and became president of the [[San Francisco and San Jose Railroad]]. In 1870, he and his partners sold the company to [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], and he served on Southern Pacific's board of directors.

From 1858 to 1861, the Santa Clarita Valley was used as a transportation corridor for the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] stagecoach service as part of its first division, stretching from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Two Butterfield Overland Mail stations were located in the area: [[Lyons Station Stagecoach Stop|Lyons Station]] in Newhall, and [[King's Station]] in San Francisquito Canyon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/files/ahnert_stations_20200101/ahnert_stations_20200101.pdf|title=Butterfield's Overland Mail Stage Stations in California from San Fernando Mission to Posey Creek|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=February 26, 2021}}</ref> [[Beale's Cut Stagecoach Pass|Beale's Cut]] was constructed in 1859 through what is now known as the [[Newhall Pass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.californiahistoricallandmarks.com/landmarks/chl-1006|title=CHL #1006 Beale's Cut Stagecoach Pass|publisher=California Historical Landmarks|access-date=January 16, 2021}}</ref>

After railroads, Newhall turned to real estate and ranching. He purchased a number of the former Spanish and Mexican land grants in the state, amassing a total of {{convert|143,000|acre|ha}} between Monterey and Los Angeles counties. The most significant portion was the Rancho San Francisco, which he purchased for $2/acre. It became known as Newhall Ranch after Newhall's death. Within this territory, Newhall granted a right-of-way to Southern Pacific through what is now Newhall Pass. He also sold the railroad part of the land, upon which the company built the town of [[Newhall, Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], founded just north of the present-day intersection of Magic Mountain Parkway and Railroad Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|last=Worden|first=Leon|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/worden/lw022404.htm|title=Newhall By Any Other Name ... is Elayon|website=scvhistory.com |date=February 24, 2004|access-date=June 6, 2021}}</ref> He moved the town south in 1879, and the original townsite was named [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]], after Henry Newhall's hometown of [[Saugus, Massachusetts]].<ref name="capace">Capace, Nancy (1999).

After his death, Newhall's heirs incorporated the [[Newhall Land and Farming Company]] in 1883. Since its founding, it has overseen the development of the communities that comprise present-day Santa Clarita, including the master-planned community of Valencia (in which it is headquartered), Canyon Country, Newhall, and Saugus. The company also manages farm land elsewhere in the state.<ref name=capace />

On September 5, 1876, [[Charles Crocker]], president of the [[Southern Pacific Company]], hammered a ceremonial spike into a railroad tie at [[Lang Southern Pacific Station]] in what is now far eastern Canyon Country, marking the completion of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] line of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], connecting Los Angeles to [[San Francisco]] and the rest of the nation for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/hs3601.htm|title=Lang Station 1936|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=January 5, 2021}}</ref>

In the 1850s and 1860s, businessmen and political leaders such as [[Andrés Pico]], Sanford Lyon, Henry Clay Wiley, Darius Towsley, and Christopher Leaming came to the Santa Clarita Valley for its oil reserves. On September 26, 1876, the town of [[Mentryville, California|Mentryville]] was founded by French immigrant Charles Alexander Mentry near present-day [[Stevenson Ranch, California|Stevenson Ranch]]. Mentryville's Pico Number 4 oil well was the first commercially successful oil well in the western United States. Oil from Mentryville was refined at [[Pioneer Oil Refinery]] in Newhall, the first viable oil refinery in the state. (Pioneer Oil Refinery is currently the only site on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] within the city limits of Santa Clarita.) By the early 1900s, most of Pico Canyon's richest oil reserves had been depleted, although Pico Number 4 continued to operate until 1990. Many of the aforementioned oil pioneers have lent their names to streets in the valley, such as Pico Canyon Road, Lyons Avenue, Wiley Canyon Road, and Towsley Canyon Road.<ref>{{cite web|last=Worden|first=Leon|url=https://scvhistory.com/mentryville/mstory.htm|title=Friends of Mentryville: California's First Oil Boom Town|publisher=Friends of Mentryville|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref> Drilling continues to occur in Santa Clarita at the [[Honor Rancho Oil Field]].

The Saugus Cafe was established in 1886 near the present-day intersection of Railroad Avenue and Magic Mountain Parkway. It is the oldest continuously operating restaurant in Los Angeles County.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Christina|url=https://www.foxla.com/news/original-saugus-cafe-las-oldest-restaurant-struggling-after-recent-outdoor-dining-ban|title=Original Saugus Cafe: LA's oldest restaurant struggling after recent outdoor dining ban|publisher=FOX11 Los Angeles|date=December 12, 2020|access-date=January 18, 2021}}</ref>

===1900–1987===
Los Angeles studios began filming in Santa Clarita shortly after the turn of the 20th century. Actors in these early films included [[William S. Hart]], [[Tom Mix]], [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], and a young [[John Wayne]]. Many [[movie ranch]]es (see [[#Films|section below]]) were developed in the Santa Clarita Valley. Hart and Carey made their homes in the valley; today both their former estates are operated as county parks.

One major contributor to the valley's early development was the Whittaker-Bermite Corporation. From 1934 to 1987, the corporation manufactured, stored, and tested explosives, including bombs and [[skyrocket|bottle rockets]], on a {{convert|996|acre||adj=mid| site}} south of Soledad Canyon Road, east of Railroad Avenue, northeast of the Circle J Ranch community, southwest of Centre Pointe Parkway, and west of Golden Valley Road. The first housing tract in the area consisted of company homes along Walnut Street in Newhall. In modern times, the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] has made efforts to clean the area of [[perchlorate]] and other toxic chemicals left behind by decades of munitions testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/lw2336.htm|title=DTSC Uses Bacteria to Rid Whittaker-Bermite of Perchlorate|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=February 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Worden|first=Leon|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg060803.htm|title=Un-Well Water: The Problem of Perchlorate|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=February 19, 2021}}</ref> The site is being considered for development.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Perry |date=February 27, 2024 |title=New developer, new plans |url=https://signalscv.com/2024/02/new-developer-new-plans/ |access-date=February 28, 2024 |website=Santa Clarita Valley Signal |language=en-US}}</ref>

The Santa Clarita Valley was the scene of the second deadliest disaster in California's history, known as the "worst civil engineering failure of the 20th century." Shortly before midnight on March 12, 1928, the [[St. Francis Dam]] collapsed. Water from the St. Francis Reservoir coursed through [[San Francisquito Canyon]] and the Santa Clara River in a wave up to {{convert|140|ft|m}} high and {{convert|2|mi|km}} wide, destroying buildings in its path. By the time the floodwaters reached the Pacific Ocean near Ventura five hours later, 411 people had died. Some buildings in Newhall became makeshift morgues. After the disaster, engineer [[William Mulholland]] resigned from his position as superintendent of the Los Angeles Bureau of Water Works and Supply (now the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power|Department of Water and Power]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Pollack|first=Alan|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/stfrancistimeline_pollack2014.htm|title=St. Francis Dam Disaster: An Extended Timeline|website=scvhistory.com|date=March 13, 2014|access-date=February 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stansell|first=Ann|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/annstansell_damvictims022214.htm|title=Roster of St. Francis Dam Victims|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=February 21, 2021}}</ref>

On December 27, 1936, [[United Airlines Trip 34]] crashed into a hilltop in Rice Canyon which is near Newhall, killing all twelve people on board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sw3602.htm|title=SCVHistory.com SW3602 {{!}} Plane Crashes {{!}} 1936 Plane Crash in Rice Canyon: Searching for Casualties|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref>

In 1945, the Santa Clarita Union High School District was created. The following year it was renamed [[William S. Hart Union High School District]] after William S. Hart. The district's first high school was [[William S. Hart High School]] in Newhall.<ref name="timeline">{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/timeline.htm|title=SCV Chronology — A Timeline of Historical Events|website=scvhistory.com|first=Leon|last=Worden|access-date=March 1, 2021}}</ref>

The first official use of the name "Santa Clarita" in a housing development appeared in the Rancho Santa Clarita housing tract in Saugus, built in 1947.<ref name=timeline/>

On September 17, 1966, William V. Fowler, Grand Cyclops (leader) of the California Knights of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], organized a reactivation rally in Soledad Canyon, on Capra Road around {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of the present-day Soledad Canyon Road exit on State Route 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/34.4312189,-118.3560775/34.4336535,-118.3856138/@34.4328167,-118.3766948,15.5z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0|title=Sulphur Springs Union Elementary School District to CA-14|website=Sulphur Springs Union Elementary School District to CA-14}}</ref> Fowler sought to reactivate the KKK in California, where it was banned by law since 1946. Estimates of the rally's size range from 30 to 100 people, far fewer than the 5,000 to 10,000 Fowler expected. The rally took place on [[United States Forest Service]] property and included a fake [[cross burning]]. Just one person was arrested at the rally – for assaulting a police officer he mistook for a Klansman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg19660901kkk.htm|title=California KKK Holds Rally, Fake Cross Burning in Soledad Canyon|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=January 8, 2021}}</ref>

On April 5, 1970, four [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] officers were shot dead by two heavily armed career criminals at a Standard Gas Station in present-day Valencia. The shootout was the deadliest attack on law enforcement in California history. As Valencia had barely been developed, it came to be known as the [[Newhall incident]]. One of the perpetrators was sentenced to life in prison; the other committed suicide. In the aftermath of the incident, policing was transformed nationwide – police training and weaponry were improved and bullet proof vests became widespread.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/al1972.htm|title=The Newhall Incident|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=February 22, 2021}}</ref>

In the early morning of July 23, 1982, a [[Twilight Zone accident|helicopter crash]] occurred at the [[Indian Dunes]] amusement park in Valencia during the making of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', killing three people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/wingo072313.htm|title=Proximate Cause: Pilot Recalls 'Twilight Zone Movie' Tragedy.|website=scvhistory.com|date=July 23, 2013|access-date=February 24, 2021}}</ref>

As early as 1920, there were attempts to incorporate some of the communities of the Santa Clara River Valley. Four years later a chamber of commerce was formed in Newhall, with one of its goals being city formation.<ref name="scvtv">{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Jerry |title=History of the Santa Clarita Valley |url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/reynolds/contents.html |website=SCVTV |access-date=July 22, 2023}}</ref>

Starting in 1970s, residents, such as educator Carl Boyer III and retired businessman H. Gil Callowhill, began efforts to determine the feasibility of incorporating Newhall, Saugus and Valencia into a city. In 1974, individuals, such as Signal co-editor Ruth Newhall, suggested that the Santa Clarita area should secede from Los Angeles County to form their own county. That December a new committee was formed to lead the fight to break Acton, Agua Dulce, Gorman, Castaic, Val Verde, Canyon Country, Saugus, Valencia and Newhall off from Los Angeles County. The new entity was to be called Canyon County. This effort eventually led to the creation of Proposition F on the 1976 November ballot. Under state law, the creation of the new county would have to be approved by all the voters in the existing county. This effort failed with sixty-eight to thirty-two percent of the county at large rejecting it. The proposed Canyon County voted fifty-five percent in favor of its creation. On November 7, 1978, the area of Canyon County tried again to secede. Proposition K revealed greater support for the creation of a new county, in which fifty-nine percent of local voters voted in favor, but, again, most LA county voters rejected it.<ref name="scvtv"/>

Despite the rejection of "home rule" through the creation of Canyon County, attention turned back to creating a new city. In the mid-1980s, Louis Garasi, president of the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce, chaired the city formation committee, with Connie Worden, a veteran of the Canyon County effort, as vice chair. As noted by Jerry Reynolds, "With strong support from the Santa Clarita Valley and Canyon Country chambers of commerce, the committee held lively, well-attended public meetings that revealed a growing interest in home rule and mounting dissatisfaction with inadequate roads." A petition campaign and the filing of the official cityhood application with the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) requested a ninety square-mile area for the proposed City of Santa Clarita. The LAFCO shrunk the proposed city to just over thirty-nine square miles, carving out most of the areas where development was pending.<ref name="scvtv"/>

The city boundaries approved by LAFCO included most of the populated areas of Newhall, Saugus, Canyon Country and Valencia. Left out were Castaic, Agua Dulce, everything west of Interstate 5, and most of the land south of State Route 14 except for Sand Canyon, whose inclusion was championed by three cityhood leaders who lived there – Lou Garasi, Jan Heidt and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon.<ref name="scvtv"/>

===1987–present: City of Santa Clarita===
[[File:Saugus High School, November 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saugus High School (California)|Saugus High School]] was the site of [[2019 Saugus High School shooting|a deadly mass shooting]] on November 14, 2019.]]
After multiple failed attempts to form a city and at least two failed attempts to form a separate county, residents of the Santa Clarita Valley finally incorporated the City of Santa Clarita on December 15, 1987. The proposal passed by a margin of two to one in that year's general election. Other proposed names for the city were "City of the Canyons" and "La Mancha"; "Santa Clarita" narrowly defeated "City of the Canyons."<ref name="Boston" /> The city's first mayor was future Congressman [[Buck McKeon]].

In 1990, the federal government awarded [[Cemex]] a contract to [[Soledad Canyon Sand and Gravel Mining Project|mine millions of tons of sand and gravel]] in Soledad Canyon, just east of the city. The proposed mine caused controversy due to its potential for air pollution, traffic congestion, and environmental damage to the [[Angeles National Forest]] and Santa Clara River. The city of Santa Clarita fought for decades to prevent mining in the canyon. In 2019, the Interior Board of Land Appeals (part of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]) upheld a 2015 decision by the [[Bureau of Land Management]], permanently preventing Cemex from mining in Soledad Canyon. Cemex had never mined any sand or gravel in the canyon.<ref>{{cite news|last=Peeples|first=Stephen K.|url=https://scvnews.com/cemex-loses-federal-appeal-soledad-canyon-mega-mine-all-but-dead/|title=Cemex Loses Federal Appeal; Soledad Canyon Mega-Mine Effectively Dead|publisher=SCV News|date=March 20, 2019|access-date=March 19, 2021}}</ref>

Santa Clarita was devastated by the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]]. The [[Newhall Pass interchange]] of I-5 and CA-14 collapsed, and [[Sierra Highway]] became the only route in and out of the valley; Sierra Highway was soon closed as well. Several surface streets throughout the city were closed due to structural damage. The Four Corners oil spill led to contamination of the Santa Clara River. Electricity was temporarily shut off for the entire valley, and schools were closed. Shelters opened in Newhall, Saugus, and Canyon Country. The [[California National Guard|National Guard]] was sent to the area, and City Hall was temporarily relocated. Water distribution points were set up as residents lost access to running water.<ref name="1994quake">{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sc9407.htm|title=Chronology of Events Following January 17, 1994 Earthquake|website=scvhistory.com|access-date=January 16, 2021}}</ref> The city suffered an estimated $76.8 million in damages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sc9405.htm|title=Santa Clarita Valley Damage Cost Estimates|publisher=City of Santa Clarita|date=December 1994|access-date=June 16, 2021}}</ref>

Santa Clarita, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]], covers an area of {{convert|70.82|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|70.75|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.07|sqmi|km2}} (0.10%) is water. Nearly half of the city's land area has been acquired via annexations; the city's area at the time of incorporation was just {{convert|39.09|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name=annexations /> The [[Newhall Pass]] is located at the southern end of the city, south of Newhall and north of the [[San Fernando Valley]] communities of [[Granada Hills, Los Angeles|Granada Hills]] and [[Sylmar, Los Angeles|Sylmar]].

[[File:Location map Santa Clarita.svg|thumb|Map of Santa Clarita, showing neighborhoods, city boundaries, freeways, major surface streets, and the Angeles National Forest]]

Santa Clarita lies within the [[Santa Clarita Valley]], bounded by the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] to the east, the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] to the south and west, and the [[Sierra Pelona Mountains]] to the north, all part of the [[Transverse Ranges]].

The broad [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara River]] passes through the city from east to west. Though usually dry, the river exhibits significant surface flow during seasonal episodes of heavy rainfall. The river's numerous tributaries incise the hilly terrain of the valley to form steep canyons after which many of the city's major streets are named. The largest of these canyons are [[Bouquet Canyon, California|Bouquet Canyon]], [[San Francisquito Canyon]], [[Sand Canyon, Los Angeles County, California|Sand Canyon]], and [[Soledad Canyon]].

===City limits===
Currently, the city is bounded by [[Interstate 5]] to the west, extending east to include almost all developed areas of the Santa Clarita Valley east of the freeway. Part of the city's eastern boundary follows [[California State Route 14]], although the city limits extend beyond Route 14 to include the communities of Aliento, Fair Oaks Ranch, Vista Canyon, and Sand Canyon; the Plaza at Golden Valley shopping center; and the Whitney Canyon, Elsmere Canyon, Golden Valley Ranch, Walker Ranch, and East Walker Ranch open spaces. Santa Clarita extends as far east as the eastern end of Shenandoah Lane, east of Shadow Pines Boulevard in Canyon Country. The city limits also include a small [[exclave]] west of Interstate 5 in Towsley Canyon Park.<ref name="annexations">{{cite web|url=https://santaclarita.gov/document-central/16334/638047105791700000|title=Completed Annexations|publisher=City of Santa Clarita|access-date=September 25, 2023}}</ref> The [[Angeles National Forest]] forms part of the city's northern and eastern boundaries, although parts of northern Saugus (north of Copper Hill Drive and Haskell Canyon Road) and Canyon Country (south of Placerita and Sand Canyon Roads) extend into the national forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd646017.html|title=Angeles NF Interactive Maps|publisher=United States Forest Service|access-date=March 26, 2021}}</ref>

===Geology===
{{further|Santa Clarita Valley#Geology}}
Santa Clarita is near the San Fernando fault zone and has been affected by the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]] and [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] (see [[#1987-present: City of Santa Clarita|above]]), both of which had epicenters in the San Fernando Valley.<ref name=1994quake/>

==Climate==
Santa Clarita experiences a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-united-states.php|title=Interactive United States Köppen Climate Classification Map|website=plantmaps.com|access-date=March 5, 2021}}</ref>
with hot, dry, sunny summers and mild, rainy winters. Due to its close proximity to the [[Mojave Desert]] ([[High Desert (California)|High Desert]]) and [[Pacific Ocean]], and the city's wide range of elevations, varying micro-climates are common. There is a large [[diurnal temperature variation]], especially in the summer.

During the summer (late June through mid-September) high temperatures average {{convert|90|-|95|F|C}}, commonly reaching {{convert|110|F|C}} or higher during heat waves. Rain is very rare. Due to the aridity, summer temperatures cool down significantly at night. Summer and fall carry significant wildfire risk due to the presence of dry brush. The hottest temperature recorded in the city is {{convert|118|F|C}} on July 5, 2024.<ref name="xmacis">[https://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/ XMACIS] ("Saugus, California" station)</ref>

During winter, temperatures are mild. In most winters, there are a few days with highs above {{convert|80|F|C}} and a few days that stay below {{convert|50|F|C}}. Temperatures rarely fall below freezing. Rain falls primarily from December through March. Snowfall is very rare; the most recent snow was a light dusting in February 2023.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/02/25/california-blizzards-multistate-storm/|title=CityNews|website=toronto.citynews.ca|date=February 26, 2023 }}</ref> Santa Clarita lies within USDA plant [[hardiness zone]] 10a, except for the far eastern part of the city, which is in zone 9b.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/|title=2023 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|access-date=November 28, 2023}}</ref>

Although generally considered a large suburb of [[Greater Los Angeles]], the city of Santa Clarita consists of four distinct communities: [[Canyon Country, Santa Clarita, California|Canyon Country]], [[Newhall, Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]], and [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]]. Each community is characterized by a mixture of single-family homes, townhomes, apartment buildings, condominiums, and commercial and industrial areas. Valencia, a [[planned community|master-planned community]], contains the city's largest shopping center ([[Valencia Town Center]]) and most of the city's corporate headquarters, government buildings, hotels, and tallest buildings.<ref name=emporis/> The neighborhoods in Canyon Country and Saugus are characterized by a wide age range, from older developments dating from the 1960s or earlier to new developments built in the 21st century.<ref name=gregory/> Newhall, the oldest area of the city, has also experienced new commercial and industrial development. Throughout the city, single-family suburban [[tract housing]] predominates, with apartment and condominium complexes along major thoroughfares. Many communities in Santa Clarita, especially in newer areas, have [[homeowner associations]], and some are gated. Placerita Canyon and Sand Canyon are [[equestrianism|equestrian]] communities with large custom ranch homes.

Communities just outside the city limits include [[Agua Dulce, California|Agua Dulce]], [[Castaic, California|Castaic]], [[Stevenson Ranch, California|Stevenson Ranch]], [[Valencia, California|unincorporated Valencia]], and [[Val Verde, California|Val Verde]]. All residents of the Santa Clarita Valley, both inside and outside the city, may use either their neighborhood or "Santa Clarita" for their mailing addresses.<ref>{{cite web | title=ZIP Code™ Lookup | website=USPS | url=https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm?bycitystate | access-date=July 11, 2021}}</ref>

Historically, Santa Clarita's population has been predominantly [[non-Hispanic White]]. Starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 1990s, white Americans, primary those from affluent backgrounds, began migrating from [[Los Angeles]] to suburban cities such as Santa Clarita, [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]], and [[Camarillo, California|Camarillo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=4.
