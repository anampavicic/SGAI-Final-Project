==History==
[[File:Gordion Museum 0851.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Statue at the [[Gordion Museum]].]]
[[File:Relief stele showing a banquet scene. From Yağri, Polatlı. Hittite Empire Period, 14th century BC. Museum of the Ancient Orient, Istanbul.jpg|thumb|Relief stele showing a banquet scene. From Yağri, Polatlı. Hittite Empire Period, 14th century BC. Museum of the Ancient Orient, Istanbul]]

=== Ancient settlement ===
The ancient [[Phrygia]]n capital [[Gordion]] is 10&nbsp;km from the city of Polatlı.

On the outskirts of Polatli there is an archaeological mound of the same name, the remains of a multi-layered settlement of the Bronze Age (3rd-2nd millennium BC).  Since the mound was being used by local people as a quarry, rescue excavations of its southern and central parts were carried out in 1949 by the Anglo-Turkish expedition led by [[Seton Lloyd]], and Nuri Gökçe, then the director of the ‘Hittite Museum in Ankara’.<ref>Lloyd, S., Gökçe, N. (1951); “Excavations at Polatlı. A New Investigation of Second and Third Millennium Stratigraphy in Anatolia", Anatolian Studies I, 21–75. {{doi|10.2307/3642358}}</ref> It was a village along the important caravan route.

=== Classical antiquity ===
On his expedition to the east, [[Alexander the Great]] cut the famous [[Gordian Knot]], an omen of his coming rule over the whole Asia.  [[Pessinus]], an ancient city on the upper river Sangarios (modern day [[Sakarya River]]), is also within the borders of Polatlı.  The mythological Phrygian [[King Midas]] is said to have ruled from Pessinus and to be buried here.

Polatlı also occupied an important place in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1919-1922 as the [[Battle of Sakarya]] (August 23-September 13, 1921) was fought here, the utmost eastern point reached by the advancing [[Greek Army]] in [[Anatolia]].  There are two memorial burial grounds of those lost in the battle. There is also a monument named [[Mehmetçik Monument]] about the battle just {{convert|6|km}} west of Polatlı.

== Hacıtuğrul mound ==
Since the 1970s, excavations by Turkish archaeologists have been carried out near the modern town and train station of [[Yenidoğan, Polatlı]], 15 km northeast of Polatli and 20 km from [[Gordion]]. This site, near [[Hacıtuğrul, Polatlı|Hacıtuğrul]], is now known as [[:tr:Hacıtuğrul Höyüğü]]. The remains of monumental fortifications and other buildings of the city from [[Phrygia]]n times, which exceeded Gordion in size, were found here. Five burial mounds were found in the vicinity.

==Composition==
There are 95 [[mahalle|neighbourhoods]] in Polatlı District:<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Mahalle], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 22 May 2023.</ref>

Today, Polatlı is an important district of Ankara on the main road which connects the capital to the west of Turkey. The city has a good range of restaurants, bars, schools and other important amenities but still a quiet rural feel to it, and little social life except cafes, patisseries and window shopping on a Sunday afternoon. There are car repair workshops but otherwise little industry. Polatlı is trying to become an independent province from Ankara and "we want to be a city" graffiti can be seen in the town.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There is a military base here and the [[Turkish Army]] Artillery School was established in Polatlı in the early 1940s and is still an important institution in the town.

Polatlıspor is a minor league football club that once climbed into the second league.

There is a large statue of a [[kangaroo]] on the main road into city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
