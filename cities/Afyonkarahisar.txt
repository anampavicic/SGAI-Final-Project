==Etymology==
The name '''Afyon Kara Hisar''' literally means ''opium black fortress'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], since [[opium]] was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Afyonkarahisar|title=Afyonkarahisar {{!}} Turkey|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> Also known simply as '''Afyon'''. Older spellings include '''Karahisar-i Sahip''', '''Afium-Kara-hissar''' and '''Afyon Karahisar'''. The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the [[Turkish Parliament]] in 2004.

===Ancient times===
{{unreferencedsect|date=February 2024}}
The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time. It was known to the [[Hittites]] as '''Hapanuwa''', and was later occupied by [[Phrygians]], [[Lydians]] and [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] until it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander the city (now known as '''Akroinοn''' (Ακροϊνόν) or '''Nikopolis''' (Νικόπολις) in [[Ancient Greek]]), was ruled by the [[Seleucids]] and the kings of [[Pergamon]], then [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].

===Medieval period===
Akroinοn became an important fortress in the [[Armeniac Theme|Armeniakon theme]] due to its strategic location and natural defences and was first mentioned in Byzantine history when it was attacked in 716 and 732 by [[Arab–Byzantine wars|Arabs invaders]].<ref name="oxford">{{ODB|last=Kazhdan|first=Alexander|last2=Cutler|first2=Anthony|title=Akroinon|page=48}}</ref> The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] renamed the city '''Nicopolis''' (Greek for "city of victory") after his [[Battle of Akroinon|victory]] over [[Arab]] besiegers under [[Abdallah al-Battal]] (who would become the famous Turkish literature figure of [[Battal Gazi]]) in 740. Since the 10th century it was also a bishopric of [[Phrygia Salutaris]].<ref name="oxford" />

After 1071 the town became part of the frontier zone between the Byzantine Empire and the invading Turks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pitcher |first1=Donald Edgar |title=An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire from Earliest Times to the End of the Sixteenth Century |date=1972 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004038288 |page=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gs4AAAAIAAJ |access-date=27 September 2023}}</ref> 
The city was still held by the former in 1112 but was lost to the [[Sultanate of Rum]] at some time before 1146 when [[Manuel I Komnenos]] won a victory here.<ref name="oxford" /><ref name="Matthews">{{cite book |last1=Matthews |first1=Roger |title=Ancient Anatolia Fifty Years' Work by the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara |date=1990 |publisher=British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara |isbn=9780995465695 |pages=309–311 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wElHDwAAQBAJ |access-date=27 September 2023}}</ref> The Turks were unable to firmly control the city until around 1210,<ref name="Matthews" /> renaming it to '''Kara Hissar''' ("black castle") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201&nbsp;meters above the town. Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the [[Sâhib Ata]] and then the [[Germiyanids]].

The castle was finally conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid I]] in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of [[Timur Lenk]] in 1402. It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.

===Modern times===

The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city. From 1867 until 1922, Afyon was part of the [[Hüdavendigâr vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1902, a fire burning for 32 hours destroyed parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |title=Latest intelligence - Turkish town burnt |date=1 September 1902 |page=4 |issue=36861}}</ref>
[[File:Afyonkarahisar_evleri,_2019_13.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman architecture]] in Afyonkarahisar]]
During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock. During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] campaign (part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]])  Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by Greek forces. However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region. After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.

The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name ''Afyon'') until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the US in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.  Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regimen.  They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the [[poppy straw]] method of extraction.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_adidu_licitcultivation |title=Archived copy |website=fco-stage.fco.gov.uk |access-date=6 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902004159/https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_adidu_licitcultivation |archive-date=2 September 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Economy==
The economy of Afyonkarahisar is based on agriculture, industries and thermal tourism. 
Especially its agriculture is strongly developed from the fact, a large part of its population living in the countrysides. Which stimulated agricultural activities greatly.

===Thermal sector===
The geography of Afyon has great geothermal activity. Hence, the place has plenty of [[thermal springs]]. There are five main springs and all of them have high mineral content with temperatures ranging between 40 and 100&nbsp;°C. The waters have strong healing properties to some diseases. As a result, plenty of thermal facilities formed over time.

In time, Afyon has developed its thermal sector with more capacity, comfort and innovation. Afyon combined the traditional bath houses with 5-star resorts, the health benefits of the natural springs have put the thermal resorts further then a mere attraction.
Hospitals and universities have come in association with thermal resorts, to utilize the full health potentials of the thermals. 
As such, [[Afyon Kocatepe University]] Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital opened for that purpose.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kurtulus Karamustafa |author2=ömer Sanlioglu |author3=Kenan Gülle |title=Ulusal Turizm Kongresi, Erciyes University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUgsCQAAQBAJ&q=afyon+termalin+baskenti|pages=245–246|year=2013|isbn=9786055216740 }}</ref>

===Pharmaceuticals and morphine===
Almost a third of all the morphine produced in the world derives from alkaloids factory in Afyon, named as "Afyon Alkaloids". this large capacity is the byproduct of Afyon's poppy plantations.

The raw opium is put through a chain of biochemical processes, resulting into several types of morphine.

In the Alkaloid Extraction Unit only base morphine is produced. In the adjacent Derivatives Unit half of the morphine extracted is converted to morphine hydrochloride, codeine, codeine phosphate, codeine sulphate, codeine hydrochloride, morphine sulphate, ethylmorphine hydrochloride.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zohara Yaniv |author2=Nativ Dudai |others=Institute of Plant Sciences|title=Medical and Aromatic Plants of the Middle-East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuSCBAAAQBAJ&q=Medicinal+and+Aromatic|page=328|year=2014|isbn=9789401792769 }}</ref>

Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it. There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey.{{cn|date=February 2024}} Nonetheless, the city does host one seat of higher education, [[Afyon Kocatepe University]]. 

[[File:Afyonkarahisar_evleri,_2019_47.jpg|thumb|Afyonkarahisar streets]]

There is also a large cement factory.

This is a natural crossroads, the routes from [[Ankara]] to [[İzmir]] and from [[Istanbul]] to [[Antalya]] intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys. There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine. Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities. There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight.
