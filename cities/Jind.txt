'''Jind''' is one of the largest and oldest [[city|cities]] in [[Jind district]] in the [[India|Indian]] state of [[Haryana]]. It is the administrative headquarter of [[Jind district]]. [[Rani Talab]] is the main destination for tourists while [[Pindara Temple|Pandu Pindara]] and [[Ramrai]] are the main religious spots, attracting devotees for the holy bath during ''[[Amavasya]]''.

==Etymology==
Jind was named Jayantapura after the lord of victory [[Indra|Jayant]] (Indra), whom [[Pandava]]s worshipped before the [[Mahabharata]] war. According to [[oral tradition]], Pandavas built the [[Jayanti Devi Temple]] in honour of Jyanti Devi (the goddess of victory, daughter  of Indra). The temple is in the centre and whole Jind city was built around it. They offered prayers for success and then started a battle against [[Kaurava]]. The town was built around the temple and named Jayantapuri (Abode of Jyanti Devi) which was later renamed to Jind. After Pandavas won the [[Kurukshetra War]] they again returned back and stayed here for 14 years in the wait for Somavati Amawasya. The village Pandu Pindara at the outskirts of Jind city is named after the same<ref name=harsamvad1>[http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf Haryana Samvad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225259/http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf |date=29 November 2018 }}, Oct 2018, p44-46.</ref>

==History==
Jind was a part of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. The site of [[Rakhigarhi]], where one of the highest number of settlements happened during Indus valley, is {{Convert|15|km|mi|sp=}} away from Jind city. It later became part of [[Kuru Kingdom]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}



Jind is listed in the [[Ain-i-Akbari]] as a [[pargana]] under the [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] of [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], producing a revenue of 5,401,749 [[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]s for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 4000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Under its entry, the author [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] mentioned the Hindu temple in the nearby village of Pandu Pindara.<ref name="Ain-i-Akbari">{{cite book |last1=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |last2=Jarrett |first2=Henry Sullivan (translator) |title=The Ain-i-Akbari |date=1891 |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |location=Calcutta |page=294 |url=https://archive.org/details/ainiakbarivolum00mubgoog |access-date=21 January 2021}}</ref>

In 1775, Maharaja Gajpat Singh Sidhu built the Jind Fort, which later came under Maharani Jind Kaur, queen of Naresh Swarup Singh Sidhu - the Jat ruler of [[Jind State]].<ref name=ta2>Sohan Singh Khattar and Reena Kar, 2021, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M60zEAAAQBAJ&dq=history+of+loharu+fort&pg=PA308 Know Your State Haryana], Arihant Publications, pp 308.</ref>

The [[Jat people|Jat]] ruler Maharaja Gajpat Singh, the great-grandson of Chaudhary Phul Singh Sidhu and the founder of the [[Phulkian Misl]], established an independent Sikh kingdom by seizing a large tract of the country with Sikh armed forces, which included the territory occupied by the present district of Jind from the Afghan governor Zain Khan in 1763. In 1775, Maharaja established Jind as the capital of the state in 1776.  The fort of Jind was built by Sidhu Jat Sikh ruler [[Maharaja Gajpat Singh]] in 1776 AD. [[Sangrur]] was chosen later as the capital of Jind State by Raja Sangat Singh (reigned 1822 to 1834).  It was under the suzerainty of the [[Maratha Empire]] for much of the 18th century. After independence, [[Jind State]] was merged with the Indian union and the territory of the district became part of the [[Sangrur district]] of the [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] (PEPSU) on 15 July 1948. On 1 November 1966, Sangrur district was divided in two and the Jind and [[Narwana]] [[tehsil]]s were merged to form the Jind district. This was one of the seven districts of the newly formed Haryana state. The Jind tehsil was bifurcated further into two tehsils: Jind and [[Safidon]] in 1967.<ref name=harsamvad1/>
