===Ancient===
{{main|Selymbria}}
Silivri, the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Selymbria''' or '''Selybria''' ({{langx|el|Σηλυ(μ)βρία}}), owed its historical importance to the natural harbor and its position on the major commercial roads. It was a colony of [[Megara]] founded on a steep 56&nbsp;m high hill east of the bay, but excavations show that it was a Thracian settlement before it was a Greek colony.

According to [[Strabo]], the city's name is a combination of the name of the mythological founder of the city, Selus, and the Thracian word that Strabo thought was used for'' polis'', "bria". This, however, did not mean polis,<ref name="cah"/> and had another meaning.

Selymbria is the birthplace of the physician [[Herodicus]], and was an ally of the [[Athens|Athenians]] in 351 BC. Until the second half of the 2nd century BC, the city could preserve its autonomy, but after its neighbours [[Byzantium]] and [[Marmara Ereğlisi|Perinthos]] became more powerful,  the city fell under their control during the next centuries. The settlement shrank into a village under the governance  of the Roman Empire. In the early 5th century, the town was officially renamed '''Eudoxiopolis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Εὐδοξιόπολις), during the reign of the Byzantine emperor [[Arcadius]] (377–408), after his wife [[Aelia Eudoxia]], though this name did not survive.

===Medieval===
In 805 AD, the Bulgarian Khan [[Kroum]] pillaged the town. In the late 9th century, Emperor [[Michael III]] constructed a fortress on the top of the hill, the ruins of which still remain, during an era in which the [[Byzantine Empire]] suffered attacks by [[Saracen]] [[pirate|corsair]]s and [[Rus' people|Rus]] raiders. With the [[Fourth Crusade]], and the fall of Constantinople to the [[Latin Empire]] in 1204, the fortress fell in quick succession to the [[Latin Empire]], Bulgarian, back to the Latins and finally was recaptured by the Byzantine successor state of the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1247, who were finally able to recapture Constantinople and restore the empire in 1261.

In 1346, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s became an ally of the pretender for the Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus]] (1292–1383), and helped him against his rival [[John V Palaeologus]] (1332–1391). The same year, Sultan [[Orhan I]] married Theodora, the daughter of John VI in Selymbria.

In 1399, Selymbria fell to the Ottomans, marking their complete encirclement of Constantinople by land in Europe. Many contemporary observers believed from then on it was a mere matter of time before the Ottomans took the Byzantine capital. However, after their disastrous defeat at the hands of [[Timur]] the Ottomans returned Selymbria and several other possessions to the Byzantines in 1403. It was sometimes attacked by the Ottomans in later years, but was not captured.

During the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Selymbria, along with [[Epibatos]], stood up against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies, and surrendered only after the city had fallen. The town remained a summer resort during the Ottoman time, as it was during the Byzantine era.

===Modern===
On the order of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], architect [[Mimar Sinan]] built 1562 a stone bridge with 33 arches just west of Silivri. The historical bridge, called "Uzunköprü" (The "Long Bridge"), is still in use today, however one arch is not visible due to sedimentation.

Prior to World War I, some Silivrian Jews immigrated to the town of [[Camagüey]], [[Cuba]].<ref name="bh"/> [[Russia]]ns occupied Silivri on February 5, 1878 for 1 month until 3 March 1878. [[Bulgaria]]ns occupied it on November 16, 1912 for 9 months until May 30, 1913.

During the war, many more [[Sephardim]] in the city left as conditions worsened due to the war.  Many of these Turkish Jews emigrated to the United States settling primarily in New York and Seattle.  Others went to Palestine, France and South America.

According to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], Silivri became a part of Greece on July 20, 1920. However, [[Italy|Italians]] took it over from the withdrawing Greek troops on October 22, 1922, according to the [[Armistice of Mudanya]]. Finally, Turkish forces entered Silivri on November 1, 1922. It was part of [[Çatalca]] province between 1923–1926 and was bounded to [[Istanbul Province]] in 1926. It was enlarged with joining of Gümüşyaka (formerly Eski Ereğli) village from [[Çorlu]] district.

==Holiday resort==
{{Tone|date=June 2011}}
[[File:Silivri03.JPG|250px|thumb|Silivri coast and the hill]]
[[File:Silivri06.JPG|thumb|Marina and Promenade of Silivri in the background]]
During the summer months, the population increases 4–5 times. Silivri is {{convert|67|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from the city center of Istanbul, and is a popular summer resort for many Istanbul residents with its {{convert|45|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} coast. It is on the highway [[State road D.100 (Turkey)|D.100]] and the motorway E80, which connect Turkey to Europe via [[Edirne]]. It takes about an hour and a half to get here from the city so is feasible for use in the summer months as a weekend and holiday retreat, although the road out here is heaving with traffic in summer.

Being accessible from Istanbul, the Marmara coast has long been used for holidaying by Istanbul's people. As the city has grown, these facilities have moved further and further away. Once [[Florya]] and [[Yeşilköy]] were resorts, today it is Tekirdağ and even further. Silivri had its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s as families would come by the busload to complexes of holiday flats that were built on the beach. The Marmara Sea suffered from pollution in the 1980s and 1990s but now efforts have been made to clean it up. All the facilities are located in the holiday housing area, the town centre of Silivri has little to offer in the way of cinema, theatre or any other cultural amenities.

Now the coast has also been blessed with resort hotels and country clubs with sports facilities including golf courses, horse riding centres and tennis courts, health and conference centers. At weekend the area is crowded with day trippers.

With all this development it is hard to find a stretch of open coastline.

The winter months are cold here, as bitter weather blows across Thrace from the [[Balkans]], and holiday homes in Silivri are not much used from mid-September until May or even June.

== Agriculture ==
The district has great agricultural potential thanks to its almost flat landscape, mild [[Thrace|Thracian]] climate and yield-effective soil, and in the 1950s and 1960s the pasture was so rich that the [[yogurt]] of Silivri was renowned. Now the reputation of the yogurt has declined due to poor quality control and mismanagement of the brand. The Silivri Yoğurt Festivali used to be a major event but nowadays there is less interest and in some years it is not even held. [[Wheat]] (246&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), [[sunflower]] (105&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and [[barley]] (50&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) are cultivated here. Vineyards were once important but have declined since the 1970s. [[Livestock]] is still important.

==Sports==
