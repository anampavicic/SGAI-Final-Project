===Economy===
Teófilo Otoni is a trade centre for an agricultural hinterland in which livestock raising is of some importance. The city has small-scale manufacturing and food-processing plants. Poor soils for agriculture and lack of industry have made Teófilo Otoni a major source of immigration to other regions of Brazil. In 2005 the GDP was R$723 million, of which 515 million was from services, 101 was from industry, and 37 million was from agriculture. Industry employed about 2,000 workers, services employed 8,800 workers, and public administration employed 2,300 workers.<ref name="IBGE">[http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php IBGE]</ref>

Téofilo Otoni's strongest economic sector is a diverse and bustling service industry. The city has several commercial areas and a shopping mall, City Mall. Prominent businesses in Teófilo Otoni include Pharmacy Indiana, Stationery Graffite, the store Magda Magazin, and Ramos Transport. The trade in precious stones is also quite important as the city is considered an International Capital of Precious Stones, which comprises a good portion of its economy.

In October 1994, government of Brazil created an [[Free-trade zone|Export Processing Zone]] of 14.31 hectares in Teófilo Otoni, attracting several industries since then.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diariodasleis.com.br/legislacao/federal/15267-cria-a-zona-de-processamento-de-exportauuo-zpe-de-teofilo-otoni-no-estado-de-minas-gerais.html|title=Diário das leis - CRIA A ZONA DE PROCESSAMENTO DE EXPORTAÇÃO - ZPE DE TEOFILO OTONI, NO ESTADO DE MINAS GERAIS.|date=1994-10-13|website=www.diariodasleis.com.br|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>
