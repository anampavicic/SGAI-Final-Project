==History==
===Premodern===
The area of the modern city of Yao was within ancient [[Kawachi Province]] and is built on land which was once [[Kawachi Bay]]. This area was a fertile delta along [[Yamato River|Old-Yamato River]], and has been cultivated since [[Yayoi period]]. In the [[Kofun period]], many powerful clans settled here and built ''[[kofun]]'' [[burial mounds]] in the foothills of the [[Mount Ikoma|Ikoma mountain range]]. In [[Asuka period]], this area was under the control of [[Mononobe clan]]. The clan was destroyed when [[Mononobe no Moriya]] was defeated by [[Soga no Umako]]. The Yuge clan, which was a cadet branch of Mononobe clan, however, kept control on the area. The monk [[Dōkyō]], who was from Yuge clan, became the most powerful person in the late [[Nara period]] through his relationship with [[Empress Shōtoku]]. He constructed ''Saikyo'' (West Capital) called Yuge-gu in this area, from which he intended rule the nation prior to his fall from power. Takayasu Castle, an ancient castle on Mount Takayasu, was constructed for defense against [[Tang dynasty]], after Yamato was defeated at the [[Battle of Baekgang]] in Korean Peninsula and rediscovered by archaeologists in 1978. During the [[Nara period]], the area Yao prospered as a transportation hub between [[Yamato Province]], [[Naniwa-kyō]] and the seacoast. During the [[Heian period]], the area was dominated by large ''[[shōen]]'' landed estates controlled by Buddhist temples and the nobility. In the [[Sengoku period]] the area was the site of several battles, including during  the summer campaign of [[Siege of Osaka]].

Before the middle term of [[Edo period]], the [[Yamato River|Yamato river]] flowed from south to north and joined to the [[Yodo River]]. However, due to flooding, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] undertook a large [[public works]] project to change the flow of the Yamato River from east to west, to empty into Osaka Bay directly. The construction decreased number of floods, and enabled this area to develop more [[paddy field]]s. In addition, cotton cultivation flourished in this area.

===Modern===
After the [[Meiji restoration]], the area became part of Osaka Prefecture. The village Yao created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, although the name "Yao" appears as far back as Heian period documents. On April 1, 1896 the area became part of Nakakawachi District, Osaka. Yao was elevated to town status on August 1, 1903. On April 1, 1948, Yao merged with the town of Ryuge and the villages of  Kyuhoji, Taisho, and Nishigo to form the city of Yao.

==Government==
Yao has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Yao contributes three members to the [[Osaka Prefectural Assembly]]. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 14th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]]. 

==Economy==
Yao is traditionally known for its production of toothbrushes, and still accounts for 40% of the Japanese market, although the contribution of toothbrush manufacturing to the total local economy is very small. The city is now known as a center for light and medium manufacturing.
