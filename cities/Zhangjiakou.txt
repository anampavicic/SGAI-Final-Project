By 2020, its population was 4,118,908 inhabitants on {{convert|36861.56|km2}}, divided into 17 Counties and Districts. The built-up (''or metro'') area made of [[Qiaoxi District, Zhangjiakou|Qiaoxi]], [[Qiaodong District, Zhangjiakou|Qiaodong]], [[Chongli District|Chongli]], [[Xuanhua District|Xuanhua]], [[Xiahuayuan District]]s largely being conurbated had 1,413,861 inhabitants in 2020 on {{convert|5266|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Zhāngjiākŏu Shì (Prefecture-level City, China) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/hebei/admin/1307__zh%C4%81ngji%C4%81k%C5%8Fu_sh%C3%AC/ |access-date=2024-10-31 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

Since ancient times, Zhangjiakou has been a stronghold of military significance and vied for by multiple sides, hence nicknamed the Northern Gate of Beijing. Due to its strategic position on several important transport arteries, it is a critical node for travel between Hebei and [[Inner Mongolia]] and connecting northwest China, Mongolia, and Beijing. [[Dajingmen]], an important gate and junction of the [[Great Wall]] of China is located here.<ref name="zjkdl">{{cite book |author1=张家口市教育科研研究所 |script-title=zh:张家口地理 |date=2003-08-01 |publisher=Hainan Press (海南出版社)}}</ref>

In the south, Zhangjiakou is largely cultivated for agricultural use. In the north, Bashang is a part of the Mongolian plateau and dominated by grasslands. The forest coverage reaches 37%, earning Zhangjiakou the title of National Forest City. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Zhangjiakou has the freshest air and the least PM 2.5 pollution of all Chinese cities north of the Yellow River. Zhangjiakou also possesses 4.6% of China's wind energy resources, and the city ranks second in solar energy use.<ref name="wgr"/>{{rp|25–30}} Zhangjiakou was one of the host cities at the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].

==Names==
Zhangjiakou is the [[Chinese tones|atonal]] [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name written {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|張家口}}}} in [[traditional characters]] and {{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|张家口}}}} in [[simplified characters|simplified ones]], meaning "[[mountain pass|pass]] of the [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang family]]". It is written {{translit|zh|Zhāngjiākǒu}} in tonal pinyin and was formerly romanized as Chang-chia-k'ou in [[Wade–Giles]] and as Changchiakow in [[Postal Map romanization]]. The name is a clipping of Zhangjiakoubu {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|張家口堡}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|张家口堡}}}},}} {{translit|zh|Zhāngjiākǒubǔ}}), "[[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] fortress of the Zhang family", named in honor of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming-era]] official Zhang Wen {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|張|文}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|张|文}}}},}} {{translit|zh|Zhāng Wén}}) who directed its construction from 1429. During China's [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican Era]], the town was also known in Chinese as Zhangyuan {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|張垣}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|张垣}}}},}} {{translit|zh|Zhāngyuán}}), "the Zhang Wall".

Until the mid-20th century, Zhangjiakou was more often known to Europeans as Kalgan from its [[classical Mongolian]] name {{translit|mn|Qaɣalɣan}} {{nowrap|([[File:Qaghalghan.svg|20px]]),}} meaning barrier or [[beam gate]],{{sfnp|''Enc. Brit.'', 9th ed.|1881}} but actually a shortened form of the full name {{translit|mn|Čiɣulaltu Qaɣalɣa}} {{nowrap|([[File:Cighulaltu qaghalgha.svg|40px]]),}} "assembly" or "meeting gate" from its importance along Sino-Mongolian trade routes. The [[modern Mongolian]] forms of these names are {{translit|mn|Haalgan}} ({{lang|mn|Хаалган}}) and {{translit|mn|Chuulalt Haalga}} ({{lang|mn|Чуулалт Хаалга}}). The [[Manchu language|Manchu]] form of the name was {{translit|mnc|Imiyangga Jase}} ([[File:Imiyangga Jase.svg|18px]]).

During the Ming dynasty, when the city was a major military outpost against the [[Northern Yuan]], it was also known as '''Wucheng''' {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|武城}}}},}} {{translit|zh|Wǔchéng}}), "Martial" or "War Town". Because of its strategic position above and northwest of Beijing, Zhangjiakou has been nicknamed "Beijing's Northern Door".{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

There are many paleolithic remains like [[Nihewan]], [[Xiaochangliang]], and [[Maquangou]] located in Guyuan county, which indicated human activities dating back possibly 2 million years ago.<ref name="sjksd">{{cite book |last1=An |first1=Junjie |last2=Han |first2=Xiangrui |last3=Chen |first3=Xiying |last4=Wang |first4=Xiaoxuan |title=Zhangjiakou Shidian (Zhangjiakou Encyclopedia) |date=2011-08-01 |publisher=Hebei Daxue Chubanshe |location=Baoding China |isbn=9787810979436}}</ref>

Around 2500 BC, the legendary ancestors of Chinese people, [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]], [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]], and [[Chiyou]] used to live in the area of [[Zhuolu Town]], and later fought the [[Battle of Zhuolu]] and [[Battle of Banquan]], amalgamating different tribes into a single [[Huaxia]] tribe, thus beginning Chinese history.<ref name="sjksd"/>

During [[Spring and Autumn period]], [[Xiongnu]] and [[Donghu people]] inhabited the northern area while [[Yan State]] (since around 11th century BC) and [[Dai (Spring and Autumn period)|Dai state]] (since 7th century BC) occupied the southern area. In 475 BC, Dai was occupied by [[Zhao Wuxu]] of [[Zhao (state)|Zhao State]]. In 300 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]] established [[Dai Commandery]], managing the area of ancient Dai state with its administrative center in Dai, currently Daiwangcheng, Yu County. During the same period of time, [[King Zhao of Yan]] sent General [[Qin Kai (general)|Qin Kai]] who was once captured by [[Donghu people]] and thus became familiar with their tactics to defeat Donghu. Following that, Yan State built [[Great Wall]] in its border extending from Zaoyang (currently northeast of Xuanhua) to [[Xiangping]] (currently north of [[Liaoyang]]). In 283 BC, King Zhao established [[Shanggu Commandery]].<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|15–16}} In 265 BC, [[Li Mu]], a famous general of Zhao, commanded and deployed troops in Dai to protect against Xiongnu. After arriving in Dai, initially Li Mu banned any counterattack against Xiongnu to preserve the strength for years, which however incurred the discontent of King of Zhao. As a result, Li Mu was sacked. Following Zhao troops' defeat later, King of Zhao reinstated Li Mu. Viewing Zhao troops as cowards, Xiongnu grew arrogant and underestimated Zhao's strength. Finally, Li Mu led troops and ambushed Xiongnu, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and great damage of Xiongnu, thus ensuring decades of peace in Zhao's borderlands.

In 228 BC, [[Wang Jian (Qin)|Wang Jian]], a [[Qin state|Qin]] general defeated Zhao army and occupied its capital, [[Handan]]. [[Jia, King Dai of Zhao|Jia]], a son of Zhao king, escaped to Dai, currently northeast of [[Yu County, Hebei|Yu County]] and declared himself as the [[Dai (Warring States period)|King of Dai]]. In alliance with [[Xi, King of Yan]], the combined army, commanded by [[Crown Prince Dan]] was defeated at Yishui. In 222 BC, [[Wang Ben]], a Qin general defeated Yan state and then, attacked Dai. He captured Jia and ended Dai as a state. Jia feared humiliation and committed suicide.

=== Qin–Han era ===
During the [[Qin dynasty]], [[Shihuangdi]] sent [[Meng Tian]], commanding 300,000 troops to defend his empire from Xiongnu's attacks. They spent 10 years connecting the Great Wall of Yan, Qin and [[History of the Great Wall of China#Great Wall of Zhao|Zhao]], thus building [[History of the Great Wall of China#Great Wall of Qin|Great Wall of Qin]], the first Great Wall of 10,000 [[li (unit)|li]], its 80-kilometer-long relics currently located in Batou ({{lang|zh-Hans|坝头}}), or Erdaogou ({{lang|zh-Hans|二道沟}}) in local slang, to the north of Zhangjiakou downtown area. The southern area of Zhangjiakou was under jurisdiction of [[Dai Commandery]] and [[Shanggu Commandery]].

During the Han dynasty, most part of the area belonged to [[You Prefecture]] while some parts belonged to [[Wuhuan]], [[Xiongnu]] and [[Xianbei]].<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|15–16}} When [[Liu Bang]] established the [[Han dynasty]], he granted Dai and the title of King of Dai to his brother [[Liu Zhong]] in 201 BC. One year later, Liu Zhong was defeated by [[Modu Chanyu]] of Xiongnu and escaped, thus demoted. In 196 BC, [[Chen Xi (rebel)|Chen Xi]], the chancellor of Zhao, rebelled against the emperor and occupied more than 20 cities soon after. As a result, Liu Bang commanded an army in person from Luoyang. During the war, the empress launched a coup d'état and killed [[Han Xin]], the most important general who helped establish the Han dynasty. With the help of [[Fan Kuai]] and [[Zhou Bo]], Liu Bang defeated Chen Xi very soon. Following the rebellion, Liu Bang granted the title of King of Dai to his third son, Liu Heng, later [[Emperor Wen of Han]].<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|17–21}}

[[File:Han Expansion.png|thumb|350px|Expansion of Han dynasty. Wei Qing's campaigns against Xiongnu is shown in red arrows.]]

Zhangjiakou was a major battleground during [[Han–Xiongnu War]]. In 127 BC, [[Xiongnu]] cavalry attacked Shanggu (currently Huailai), Yuyang. The [[Emperor Wu of Han]] launched a successful counterattack. In 124 BC, Xiongnu cavalry invaded Dai Commandery. Emperor Wu ordered [[Wei Qing]] commanding 100,000 troops to counterattack. Wei Qing left the Great Wall more than 600 to 700 kilometers, encircled Xiongnu's head, Youxianwang ({{lang|zh-Hans|右贤王}}). In 122 BC, 50,000 Xiongnu invaded Shanggu, killed hundreds of people. In next March, Huo Qubing commanded 10,000 cavalry to counterattack and achieved success. In 119 BC, Wei Qing and Huo Qubing each commanded 50,000 cavalry. Huo Qubing departed from Dai Commandery, marched 2000 li northward crossing Gobi desert. Finally, Han troops defeated Xiongnu under [[Yizhixie]] completely. Following the success, a new office, the Colonel-Protector of the [[Wuhuan]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|护乌桓校尉}}), was established in Shanggu in order to prevent contact between the Wuhuan with the Xiongnu and to use them to monitor the Xiongnu activities.<ref name=y86-437>{{cite book | last=Yü | first=Ying-shih | chapter=Han Foreign Relations | title=The Cambridge History of China, Volume 1: The Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. - A.D. 220 | year=1986 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | isbn=0-521-24327-0 |page=437}}</ref> In 106 BC, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] organized the Western Han dynasty into 13 province-sized prefectures, each administered by a cishi ({{linktext|lang=zh|刺史}}) or inspector, thus putting Shanggu and Dai under the jurisdiction of [[You Prefecture]].

Following the [[Xin dynasty]], Lu Fang ({{lang|zh-Hans|卢芳}}) rebelled against Han but was defeated. Then, [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] granted him the King of Dai. In 48 AD, the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] established Colonel-Protector of the Wuhuan in Ningcheng ({{lang|zh-Hans|宁城}})<!--not [[Ningcheng County]], Inner Mongolia-->, Shanggu (currently, Ningyuanbao [[Qiaodong District, Zhangjiakou|Qiaodong District]]), representing Han's management of Wuhuan. Meanwhile, Han also opened Hu Market ({{lang|zh|胡市}}) to conduct regular exchanges with Wuhuan in Ningcheng. From 110 AD, Ningcheng also began to manage affairs with [[Xianbei]].<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|21–22}}

=== Jin–Sui era ===
In 274, Western Jin divided Shanggu Commandery and established Guangning Commandery ({{lang|zh-Hant|廣寧郡}}) in Xialuo ({{lang|zh|下洛}}, in the west of present Zhuolu), which was disestablished during [[Northern Qi]].

During the period known as [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] in Chinese history when the northern China was repeatedly invaded and occupied various nomadic peoples from further north, Zhangjiakou area became part of [[Dai (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Dai]], [[Former Yan]], ultimately ruled by [[Northern Wei]] of Xianbei. In 310, by helping Jin's [[Liu Kun (Jin dynasty)|Liu Kun]], the governor of Bingzhou to fight Xiongnu state of [[Han Zhao]], [[Tuoba Yilu]], the supreme chieftain of the Tuoba, was appointed Duke of Dai by [[Western Jin]] and since 315, the King of Dai. In 376, Dai was conquered by [[Former Qin]] state.

Former Qin fell into disarray in 383 following its defeat by Jin forces at the [[Battle of Fei River]]. In 386, [[Tuoba Gui]], the grandson of [[Tuoba Shiyijian|Tuoba Shiyiqian]], the last King of Dai, took the opportunity to reestablish Dai and soon changed its name from Dai to Wei. Initially, Tuoba Gui was a vassal of [[Later Yan]] but claimed imperial title in 397 after defeating [[Murong Bao]] of Yan in [[Battle of Canhe Slope]]. Later, Tuoba Gui was given the title of [[Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei]].

In 423, in order to defend itself from [[Rouran]]'s invasions, Northern Wei built a Great Wall from [[Chicheng]] to the east and [[Wuyuan Commandery|Wuyuan]] to the West, and established [[Huaihuang]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|懷荒}}, in present [[Zhangbei, Hebei|Zhangbei]]), Rouxuan ({{lang|zh|柔玄}}, in present [[Shangyi]]), Woye ({{lang|zh|沃野}}, in present [[Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia]]) as two of the [[Six Frontier Towns]]. Later on, Yuyi ({{lang|zh|御夷}}, in present Chicheng and Guyuan ) was added. In 523, an uprising happened in Huaihuang, thus starting the Rebellion of Six Frontier Towns, an anti-Sinicization movement among northern peoples. In 525, Du Luozhou ({{lang|zh|杜洛周}}) led Shanggu Uprising, leading to many similar uprising to respond, including [[Gao Huan]]'s. Next year, Du Luozhou broke through [[Juyong Pass]] and occupied [[You Prefecture]].<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|23}}

=== Tang–Song era ===
In 645, [[Taizong of Tang]] had a north march in [[Jiming Mountain]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|鸡鸣山}}) during his [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Xueyantuo|campaign against Xueyantuo]]. In 822, Tang established Longmen County ({{lang|zh-Hant|龍門縣份}}) and Huai'an County ({{lang|zh-Hant|懷安縣}}), thus the first appearance of Huai’an. In 866. Tang established Xinzhou ({{lang|zh|新州}}), the administrative center located to the west of Zhuolu. In 877, [[Li Keyong]], the grandfather of Li Cunxu, later the emperor of [[Later Tang]], was serving as the deputy commander of the Shatuo troops and stationed in Yuzhou, turning this place into his base for future struggles. In 899, Wuzhou ({{lang|zh|武州}}) was established with its administrative center in Xuanhua. Meanwhile, Wende County ({{lang|zh-Hant|文德縣}}) was established, the administrative center in present Xuanhua.

During the period of Five Dynasties, Zhangjiakou area, like other places in northern China, underwent repeated changes of rules of different dynasties. In 937, in order to enlist the help from [[Khitan people]] to defeat [[Later Tang]], [[Shi Jingtang]] of [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)]] agreed to cede [[Sixteen Prefectures]] to Khitan, later [[Liao dynasty]], in which Xinzhou ({{lang|zh|新州}}, present [[Zhuolu Town|Zhuolu]]), Weizhou ({{lang|zh|妫州}}, [[Huailai]]), Wuzhou ({{lang|zh|武州}}), Yuzhou ({{lang|zh|蔚州}}) were included. The Sixteen Prefectures held strategic locations in the north and because the Great Wall was across Zhangjiakou area, the cession left China in a vulnerable position against the invasions from the north. In 951, Yelu Ruan, the [[Emperor Shizong of Liao]] intended to attack [[Later Zhou]] in the south despite the reluctance of many subordinate tribes. While passing Huoshendian ({{lang|zh|火神淀}}), the west of Xinzhou, a rebellion broke out and Yelu Gecha ({{lang|zh|耶律察割}}) and Yelu Pendu ({{lang|zh|耶律盆都}}) assassinated the drunken emperor. The rebellion was put down very soon by Shizong's successor, Yelu Jing, the [[Emperor Muzong of Liao]].

During the reign of [[Emperor Jingzong of Liao]], the empress [[Xiao Yanyan]] often took part in politics and war. She often stationed troops in Yanzicheng ({{lang|zh|燕子城}}present [[Zhangbei, Hebei|Zhangbei]]), the name of which is believed to derive from Xiao Yanyan in preparations for the War against Song. Attracted by the beautiful scenery in Zhangjiakou area, she built two royal gardens, Shanghuayuan ({{zh|labels=no|t=上花園 |l=Upper Garden}}) and [[Xiahuayuan]] ({{zh|labels=no|t=下花園 |l=Lower Garden}}, in present [[Xiahuayuan District]]). Xiao resided there often and enlisted many talent in his war with the [[Song dynasty]].

In 1168, the [[Emperor Shizong of Jin]] traveled to Helihudongchuan ({{lang|zh-Hant|曷里滸東东川}}). Seeing the fully blossoming yellow flowers, he named the yellow flowers Jinlianhua ({{lang|zh-Hant|金蓮花}}) and the place became Jinlianchuan ({{zh|labels=no|t=金蓮川 |l=River of Golden Lotus}}).

=== Yuan–Ming–Qing era ===
[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|300px|Battle of Yehuling of 1211, the decisive battle between Mongols and Jin dynasty, leading to the ultimate conquest of northern China.]]
In August 1211, during the [[Battle of Yehuling]], [[Genghis Khan]]'s 90,000 strong force destroyed the 450,000 strong [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] army. In 1251, [[Möngke Khan]] became the [[List of Yuan emperors|Khagan of the Mongol Empire]]. He put [[Kublai]], his brother, in charge of affairs of northern China. Kublai established Jinlianchuan [[Mufu]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|金蓮川幕府}}), enlisting many talent of Han people like [[Liu Bingzhong]] to assist his governance. Kublai regularly consulted them and discussed politics, religion ranging from [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].

In 1307, [[Külüg Khan]] or the Emperor Wuzong of Yuan began the construction of Yuan Zhongdu ({{lang|zh|元中都}}) in Onggachatu ({{lang|zh|旺兀察都}}, north to present Zhangbei) where the court was moved. However, before full completion, Emperor Wuzong died soon and his successor Wuzong's brother, [[Emperor Renzong of Yuan]] called it off. In August 1329, during Tianli Incident following the [[War of the Two Capitals]], the new emperor [[Khutughtu Khan Kusala]] was poisoned to death by [[El Temür]] in Zhongdu. Zhongdu was later destroyed in 1357 during the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] as the rebels marched towards [[Shangdu]].

In 1370, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] ordered his general, [[Tang He]], to occupy Xuande ({{lang|zh|宣德}}), later changed to Xuanfu ({{lang|zh|宣府}}), Hua Yunlong to occupy Yunzhou ({{lang|zh-Hant|雲州}}), seated in the north of Chicheng. Xuanfu was one of the [[Nine Garrisons of the Ming dynasty]]. In order to defend China proper from invasions from the north, Ming emperors, especially [[Yongle Emperor]] (who sent the fleet of [[Zheng He]] journeying as far as East Africa) put great emphasis on the building of defensive forces in northern China, where most troops were deployed in Xuanfu, reaching 151 thousand during 1403 to 1424. Fighting Mongols, [[Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols]] mainly took place to the north of Zhangjiakou. In 1429, the official Zhang Wen began fortifying the city, which was subsequently renamed in his honor.

[[File:Tumu Crisis.jpg|350px|thumb|Tumu Crisis]]
On September 1, 1449, while retreating from the campaign against Mongols ([[Oirats]]), the 500,000-man army was defeated and the [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming]] was captured by chasing Mongolian troops in [[Huailai County]], which was later called [[Tumu Crisis]]. The Emperor was sent back next year but only restored his throne in 1457. In 1529, local officer Zhang Zhen ({{lang|zh-Hans|张珍}}) built a small gate to north, which was strengthen in 1574 and 1581. Zhangjiakoubu enjoyed a paramount strategic position, thus being called Wuheng ({{zh|labels=no|c=武城 |l=Martial Town}}). Therefore, Zhangjiakoubu was the origin and starting point of modern-day Zhangjiakou City.<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|29–31}}
[[File:Zhangjiakou Fortress 20210626.jpg|left|thumb|Zhangjiakoubu is the origin of today's Zhangjiakou City]]

In 1514 and 1517, [[Dayan Khan]] led Mongol troops to invade China, causing great damage. He built forts in Xuanhua and [[Datong]] and stationed 15000 troops on Ming territory. Culminating in the Battle of Yingzhou ({{lang|zh-Hant|應州大捷}}) in 1517, Dayan Khan was killed in the battle. From 1545, Xuanda Governor Weng Wanda ({{lang|zh-Hant|宣大總督翁萬達}}) began building Xuanfu Great Wall, reaching 462 li (231&nbsp;km) next year. In 1545, he built Great Walls again, reaching 169 li (84.5&nbsp;km), effectively defending the area of Mongol cavalry's invasion.<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|115}}

[[File:Kalgan 1698.jpg|thumb|View of Zhangjiakou ("Kalgan") in 1698]]

In 1571, [[Altan Khan]] of Mongols received the title "Prince of Shunyi" (Obedient and Righteous Prince) from the [[Longqing Emperor]], thus reaching an agreement of lasting peace with Ming. Since then, the city of Zhangjiakou was transformed from a military base to an important horse market for Mongolian mounts imported into China.<ref name="sjksd"/>{{rp|40}} The water-scarce city was historically the chief northern gate in the [[Great Wall]] to China for Europeans travelling along the [[Siberian Route|Northern Tea Road]] through [[Juyong Pass]], including [[Ivan Petlin]] in 1619<ref>"A Relation of two Russe Cossacks travailes, out of Siberia to Catay, and other Countries adjoyning thereunto.

The city name reported by Petlin appears in Purchas' English translation as "Shirokalga".</ref> and [[Nicolae Milescu]]. From 1727{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} it was an important station for the [[Kyakhta trade]] between Russia and China. In early autumn long lines of camels would come in from all quarters for the conveyance of the tea chests from Zhangjiakou to [[Kyakhta]] across the [[Gobi Desert]]. Each caravan usually made three journeys in the winter. In the 19th century, the town had an estimated population of 70{{ndash}}100,000 and some [[Russian Empire|Russian]] merchants had permanent residences and warehouses just outside the gate.{{sfnp|''Enc. Brit.'', 9th ed.|1881}}

===Modern history===
[[File:Jztl-6.jpg|thumb|250px|Two trains passing the Qinglongqiao Station on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway]]
In October 1909, Zhangjiakou was connected with Beijing by [[Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway]], the first railway solely designed and built by Chinese people. [[Zhan Tianyou]] was the chief engineer. The [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] noted that, in Kalgan, "the ordinary houses have an unusual appearance, from the fact that they are mostly roofed with earth and become covered with green-sward" and that "on the way to Peking the road passes over a beautiful bridge of seven arches, ornamented with marble figures of animals". Following [[Xinhai Revolution]], Zhangjiakou was incorporated into Chahar Special Administrative Region, later changed to [[Chahar Province]] in 1928, after the success of [[Northern Expedition]] of [[Kuomintang]].

In 1937, the Japanese occupied the region and made Kalgan the capital of the autonomous Cha-nan (South Chahar) Province. The Federated Mengjiang Commission was set up to supervise the economic affairs, banking, communications, and industry of Japanese-occupied Inner Mongolia ([[Mengjiang]]).

During the second phase of the Chinese Civil War, The 35th Army under [[Fu Zuoyi]] was surrounded at [[Xinbao'an]] of Zhangjiakou and defeated. This caused Fu Zuo Yi to quickly strike a deal with the Communists and make peace.

In the early 1960s, at the height of Sino-Soviet tensions, Zhangjiakou was considered one of the most important cities in China for [[military strategy]] reasons. Zhangjiakou was aptly nicknamed, "Beijing's Northern Door", because whoever controlled Zhangjiakou was in a good position to either attack (in the case of the Soviets) or defend (in the case of the Chinese) Beijing.

Zhangjiakou hosted some of the events in the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2022/1016809-beijing-and-zhangjiakou-launch-a-joint-bid-to-host-the-2022-winter-olympic-games |title=Beijing and Zhangjiakou launch a joint bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games |publisher=Insidethegames.biz |date=2013-11-05 |access-date=2014-03-28}}</ref>

==Tourism==
[[File:Dajingmen 04 July 2,2010.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Dajingmen]], a gate of Great Wall built around 1644]]
Lying in between the [[Mongolian Plateau]] and the [[North China Plain]], Zhangjiakou has a somewhat rugged topography characterized by high mountains, deep valleys, and rocky pathways. As a result, it serves as a perfect natural screen for Beijing, which has made it a strategic priority militarily since ancient times. It is called "The Gateway to Beijing" and "The Mountain City beyond the Great Wall". The grand Yan Mountain, the towering Taihang Mountain, the vast grasslands, and the meandering Sangyang River converge here. The city government has regarded tourism as a major driving force of the city's economy and continues to develop the industry.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

As a place where water resources for Beijing is located, ecological and sustainable development have been emphasized by local government. Due to its less impact on environment than heavy industry, tourism figures significantly in local policies of development. Possessing diverse landforms, such as plains, hills, mountains, basins and grasslands, Zhangjiakou is an ideal place for holidays, entertainment sightseeing for neighbour middle class and can provide tourists with a variety of experiences. In the area, there are significant differences in different seasons. In winter, tourists can ski in Chongli Mountains; in spring, they can visit historical sites; in summer, visitors can sleep in Mongolian yurts on Zhangbei Grassland, where annual musical events were held and taste fresh mutton; while in autumn, visitors can taste Huailai wine and take a bath in nearby hot springs.<ref name="wgr">{{cite book |last1=Merker |first1=Peter |last2=Zhao |first2=Zhanhua |title=Zhangjiakou Through the Eyes of Foreigners |date=July 2016 |publisher=Xiandai Chubanshe |location=Beijing China |isbn=9787514337976}}</ref>{{rp|155}}

In today's Zhangbei county a major attraction are the ruins and museum of the former Yuan capital Zhongdu.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zhou|first=Raymond|date=2016-09-05|title=A lost capital haunted by ghosts and history|work=China Daily|url=https://www.chinadailyasia.com/lifeandart/2016-09/05/content_15490548.html|access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Zhangjiakou is located in the northwest part of Hebei province, and is defined by mostly rough terrain created by the [[Yin Mountains]], with elevations increasing from southeast to northwest. The east of the prefecture marks the [[Yan Mountains]] The bordering prefectures in the province are [[Chengde]] to the northeast and [[Baoding]] to the south. It also borders [[Shanxi]] to the west and southwest and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the northwest. The prefecture's latitude ranges from 39° 30' to 42° 10' N, or {{convert|289.2|km}}, while its longitude spans 113° 50' to 116° 30' E, or {{convert|216.2|km}}.

Zhangjiakou City is divided into three topographical regions: plateau, mountains, and basin. The former has elevations generally above {{convert|1400|m}}, and consists of all of Guyuan and Kangbao Counties as well as part of Shangyi and Zhangbei Counties. This area is part of the southern end of the [[Inner Mongolia Plateau]] ({{lang|zh-hans|内蒙古高原}}) and accounts for one-third of the prefecture's area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zjk.gov.cn:80/syscolumn/zjzjk/dlhj/index.html |script-title=zh:地理环境 | language = zh-hans |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707184331/http://www.zjk.gov.cn:80/syscolumn/zjzjk/dlhj/index.html |archive-date=July 7, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The basin area has elevations of {{convert|500|to|1000|m|ft|sigfig=2}} and supports a few rivers.

The urban area of Zhangjiakou is surrounded by mountains on three sides. The [[Qingshui River (Zhangjiakou)|Qingshui River]] passes through the city, dividing the city into two districts, [[Qiaodong District, Zhangjiakou|Qiaodong District]] and [[Qiaoxi District, Zhangjiakou|Qiaoxi District]].<ref>{{cite book|title=京张历史文化与当代发展|editor=陈剑|location=Beijing|publisher=国家行政学院出版社|year=2017|isbn=978-7-5150-1909-3|language=zh|page=19}}</ref>

Zhangjiakou has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, continental [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''), with long, cold, dry, and windy winters due to the [[Siberian anticyclone]], and hot, humid summers driven by the [[East Asian monsoon]]; in between spring and autumn are dry and brief. Conditions are much cooler than in Beijing due in part to the elevation. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−8.1|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|24.2|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|9.2|°C|1}}.
