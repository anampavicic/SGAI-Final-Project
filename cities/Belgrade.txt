Belgrade is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe]] and the world. One of the most important prehistoric cultures of [[Europe]], the [[Vinča culture]], evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC.

Belgrade served as capital of the [[Serbian Despotate]] during the reign of [[Stefan Lazarević]], and then his successor [[Đurađ Branković]] returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427.

Following the [[Serbian Revolution]], Belgrade was once again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. [[Zemun|Northern Belgrade]] remained the southernmost [[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg]] post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming part of the new [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] after [[World War I]].

The northern regions of what is now Serbia persisted as the [[Serbian Despotate]], with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under [[Stefan Lazarević]], the son of Serbian prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]]. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the [[Despot Stefan Tower|Despot's tower]] and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.<ref name="beogradrs-4" />

At the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population.

The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Istorija Beograda |editor-last=Antonić |editor-first=Zdravko |year=1995 |location=Belgrade |pages=263–264}}</ref>

His project of creating a new market space (the Abadžijska čaršija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja čaršija and Gornja čaršija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual [[Exodus of Muslims from Serbia (1862)|disappearance of the city's Muslim population]]. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas''). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pašina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pašina, Bajram-begova, and Laz Hadži-Mahmudova.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beogradski odonimi. |last=Radović |first=Srđan |year=2014 |location=Belgrade |pages=47–48}}</ref> Following the [[Čukur Fountain incident]], Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vesković |first1=Ivana |title=Čukur česma=Čukur fountain |date=2010 |publisher=The Cultural Heritage Protection Institute of the City of Belgrade |location=Belgrade |isbn=978-86-81157-45-9}}</ref>

On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from [[Kalemegdan]]. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's ''de facto'' independence dates from this event.<ref>Stanford J.

He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a [[grid plan]]. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimović's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul—the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia ''de jure'' still belonged—underwent similar changes.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Nationalism and Architecture. |editor-last=Quek |editor-first=Raymond |year=2012 |location=Farnham |page=97}}</ref>

===World War I: Austro–German invasion ===
[[File:Bg-7 Panorama s Topčiderskog brda 1920.jpg|thumb|900px|center|Belgrade seen from [[Topčider]] hill in 1920.]]

The First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]] shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] under General [[Oskar Potiorek]] on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Serbian troops]] under Marshal [[Radomir Putnik]]. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]] on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and [[French Army|French troops]] on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]] of France and [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia]]. Belgrade, devastated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom]] to [[Subotica]] for some time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.balkanology.com/serbia/article_vojvodina.html |title=Serbia :: Vojvodina |publisher=Balkanology |access-date=7 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312085105/http://balkanology.com/serbia/article_vojvodina.html |archive-date=12 March 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
After the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1929. The Kingdom was split into [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]] and Belgrade, together with [[Zemun]] and [[Pančevo]], formed a separate administrative unit.<ref>{{ISBN|86-17-09287-4}}: Kosta Nikolić, Nikola Žutić, Momčilo Pavlović, Zorica Špadijer: Историја за трећи разред гимназије, Belgrade, 2002, p. 144.</ref>
During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://scindeks.nb.rs/article.aspx?artid=0350-03730101087P&redirect=ft |title=Industrija i urbani razvoj Beograda |first2=R |last2=Arold |last1=Petrović |first1=Dragan |journal=Industrija |year=2001 |volume=21 |issue=1–4 |pages=87–94 |access-date=10 July 2007 |issn=0350-0373 |format=PDF |id=0350-03730101087P |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217212301/http://scindeks.nb.rs/article.aspx?artid=0350-03730101087P&redirect=ft |archive-date=17 December 2008}}</ref>

===Development===
[[File:Belgrade Waterfront 12.jpg|thumb|900px|center|Belgrade Waterfront (Beograd na Vodi)]]
In 2014, [[Belgrade Waterfront]], an urban renewal project, was initiated by the [[Government of Serbia]] and its [[United Arab Emirati|Emirati]] partner, [[Eagle Hills Properties]]. Around €3.5 billion was to be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Ekonomija/435629/Ovako-ce-izgledati-Beograd-na-vodi |title=Ovako će izgledati "Beograd na vodi" |publisher=Blic.rs |date=19 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222204657/http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Ekonomija/435629/Ovako-ce-izgledati-Beograd-na-vodi |archive-date=22 February 2014}}</ref>{{update inline|date=December 2021}} The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned '[[Belgrade Tower]]'. The project is, however, quite controversial—there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2016/12/08/inside-abu-dhabis-bad-joke-the-belgrade-waterfront-project/#49c14d826c12 |title=A Look at Abu Dhabi's 'Bad Joke': The Belgrade Waterfront Project |website=[[Forbes]] |access-date=7 November 2017 |archive-date=7 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107172658/https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2016/12/08/inside-abu-dhabis-bad-joke-the-belgrade-waterfront-project/#49c14d826c12 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In addition to [[Belgrade Waterfront]], the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of [[New Belgrade|Novi Beograd]], where (as of 2020) apartment and office buildings were under construction to support the burgeoning [[Belgrade IT sector]], now one of Serbia's largest economic players. In September 2020, there were around 2000 active construction sites in Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web |last=Online |first=Piše: Danas |date=19 September 2020 |title=Vesić: U Beogradu se ove godine gradi više nego lane |url=https://www.danas.rs/beograd/vesic-u-beogradu-se-ove-godine-gradi-vise-nego-lane/ |access-date=22 December 2020 |website=Dnevni list Danas |language=sr-RS |archive-date=23 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023014923/https://www.danas.rs/beograd/vesic-u-beogradu-se-ove-godine-gradi-vise-nego-lane/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The city budget for 2023 stood at 205,5 billion dinars (1.750 billion Euros).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://n1info.rs/english/news/belgrade-2023-budget-adopted/|title=Belgrade 2023 budget adopted|date=27 December 2022|website=N1}}</ref> The budget for the city of Belgrade has been estimated to be more than 2 billion Euros for 2024.

==Geography==
===Topography===

[[File:Ушће Саве у Дунав поред десне обале Великог ратног острва и Калемегдана.jpg|thumb|right|The confluence of the [[Sava]] (river on the right side) into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade with view on [[Belgrade Fortress|Kalemegdan Fortress]] (up-right)]]

Belgrade lies {{cvt|116.75|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] rivers.<ref name="nurden-2009" /> The historical core of Belgrade, [[Belgrade Fortress|Kalemegdan]], lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, [[New Belgrade]] was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with [[Zemun]]. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like [[Krnjača]], [[Kotež]] and [[Borča]], also merged with the city, while [[Pančevo]], a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains separate. The city has an urban area of {{cvt|360|km2|sqmi}}, while together with its metropolitan area it covers {{cvt|3223|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="city of belgrade-3" />

On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is [[Torlak (Belgrade)|Torlak hill]] at {{cvt|303|m|ft}}. The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{cvt|511|m|ft}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{cvt|628|m|ft}}) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of [[alluvial plain]]s and [[loam|loessial]] [[plateau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201033 |publisher=City of Belgrade |title=Natural Features |access-date=12 December 2012 |archive-date=24 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062300/http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201033 |url-status=live }}</ref><!--{{cite conference |url=http://www.geo.uni.lodz.pl/~icuc5/text/P_1_10.pdf |title=Topoclimate and air pollution effects on respiratory diseases occurrences in Belgrade |first=Verica |last=Gburčik |first2=Valentina |last2=Gburčik |first3=Ljubinka |last3=Marčetić |first4=Slobodan |last4=Tošović |publisher=Institute of Public Health of Belgrade |format=PDF}}-->
[[File:DJI 0387-12.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Monument to the Unknown Hero]] on the mountain [[Avala]], [[Avala Tower]] and city of Belgrade in distance.]]
One of the characteristics of the city terrain is [[mass wasting]]. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. The most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Višnjica, Serbia|Višnjica]], [[Vinča]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Voždovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].

Landslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardoš]], [[Ćukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]].

However, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation |first=Nikola |last=Belić |title=Klizišta nisu samo hir prirode |newspaper=[[Politika]] |language=sr |date=8 November 2011 |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode |access-date=12 June 2017 |archive-date=18 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918145849/http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=Nikola |last=Belić |title=Otapanje pokreće i klizišta |newspaper=Politika |language=sr |date=22 February 2012 |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista |access-date=12 June 2017 |archive-date=26 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926073714/http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Belgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from {{cvt|1.9|°C|1}} in January to {{cvt|23.8|°C|1}} in July, with an annual mean of {{cvt|13.2|°C|1}}.

Although there are several historic religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup of the city is relatively homogeneous. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] community is by far the largest, with 1,475,168 adherents. There are also 31,914 Muslims, 13,720 Roman Catholics, and 3,128 [[Protestantism|Protestants]].

There once was a significant [[History of the Jews in Serbia|Jewish community]] in Belgrade but, following the World War II [[History of Serbia#Serbia in World War I|Nazi occupation]] of the city and subsequent Jewish emigration, their numbers have fallen from over 10,000 to just 295.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Knjiga4_Veroispovest.pdf |title=2011 Census |access-date=17 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715000726/http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Knjiga4_Veroispovest.pdf |archive-date=15 July 2014}}</ref> Belgrade also used to have one of the largest [[Buddhist]] colonies in Europe outside Russia when some 400 mostly Buddhist [[Kalmyks]] settled on the outskirts of Belgrade following the [[Russian Civil War]].

[[File:Church of Saint Sava (Belgrade, Serbia).jpg|thumb|right|[[Church of Saint Sava]]]]
Lying on the main artery connecting Europe and Asia, as well as, eventually, the [[Orient Express]], Belgrade has been a popular place for travellers through the centuries. 
In 1843, on Dubrovačka Street (today Kralj Petar Street ), Serbia's ''[[knez (title)|knez]]'' [[Mihailo Obrenović]] built a large edifice which became the first hotel in Belgrade: ''Kod jelena'' ('at the deer's'), in the neighbourhood of [[Kosančićev Venac]]. Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, but it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the ''staro zdanje'', or the 'old edifice'.
