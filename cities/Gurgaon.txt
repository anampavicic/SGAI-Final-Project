During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and initially during the [[British Raj|British colonial era]], Gurgaon was just a small village in [[Jharsa]] [[paragana]] of Delhi [[subah]]. Report of a Tour in Eastern Rajputana in 1882–83 (published in 1885) by [[Alexander Cunningham]], the then Director-General of [[Archaeological Survey of India]], he mentions a stone pillar at Gurgaon of a local feudal lord ''"Durgga Naga"'' with a 3-line inscription ''"[[Vikram Samvat|Samvat]] 729 or 928, [[Vaisakha|Vaisakh]] badi 4, Durgga Naga lokatari bhuta"'' dating back to 672 CE or 871 CE. Jharsa paragana passed to [[Begum Samru]] in 1776–77 and came under direct British rule in 1836 after her death when her territory was taken over by the British who established a civil lines at Jharsa and a cavalry cantonment at nearby Hiyadatpur. An 1882 land revenue settlement report records that the [[Sheetla Mata Mandir Gurgaon|idol of Sitla Mata]] was brought to Gurgaon 400 years earlier (15th century). Begum Samru claimed the offering to Sitla Mata temple during the [[Chaitra]] month and the revenue from the offerings given to the deity for rest of the month was distributed among the prominent [[jat people|Jat]] [[zamindar]]s of the area.<ref>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Gurugram-plan-a-misdirected-govt-move-from-history-to-myth/articleshow/51961328.cms Gurugram plan a misdirected govt move from history to myth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122154220/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Gurugram-plan-a-misdirected-govt-move-from-history-to-myth/articleshow/51961328.cms |date=22 January 2019}}, Times of India.</ref>

Gurgaon is notorious for its urban floods every monsoon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/haryana/dont-travel-to-water-logged-gurugram-police-advises-delhiites-heavy-traffic-jam-on-delhi-jaipur-highway_1912850.html|title=Traffic nightmare in Gurgaon; waterlogging on NH8 hits Delhi-Jaipur route, schools shut|date=29 July 2016|access-date=16 February 2017|language=en|newspaper=Zee News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216143047/http://zeenews.india.com/news/haryana/dont-travel-to-water-logged-gurugram-police-advises-delhiites-heavy-traffic-jam-on-delhi-jaipur-highway_1912850.html|archive-date=16 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The areas on NH-8 around Hero Honda Chowk, Basai, Dhankot, sector 37 etc. see massive urban floods and headlines grabbing traffic jams reported widely in news media.

Disruptions in the hydrological flow of natural drains and limited drainage capacity are all primary reasons for the floods.<ref name="hindustantimes.com"/>

Gurgaon's Ghata Jheel, Badshahpur Jheel, Khandsa Talab were linked to [[Najafgarh drain]] which links to [[Yamuna river]], via natural water channels and drains.<ref name=":0" />

As per the ground reports and research, the three natural water bodies are struggling for their existence with encroachments on their lands and natural channels. Agencies responsible have tried to create artificial water bodies to compensate, but the efforts fail due to unpredictable rain and water flow patterns leading to deployment of water pumps to fight the situation.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Bagish Jha|date=30 March 2016|title=Huda to speed up construction of additional discharge drain under service road of NH-8 {{!}} Gurgaon News - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/huda-to-speed-up-construction-of-additional-discharge-drain-under-service-road-of-nh-8/articleshow/51617586.cms|access-date=17 September 2021|website=The Times of India|language=en|archive-date=17 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210917041541/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/huda-to-speed-up-construction-of-additional-discharge-drain-under-service-road-of-nh-8/articleshow/51617586.cms|url-status=live}}</ref>
