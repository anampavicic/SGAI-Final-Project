==History==
[[File:Blue diopsidite skarn Buryatia Republic, Transbaikalia, eastern Siberia.jpg|thumb|Unusual blue [[diopside|diopsidite]] [[skarn]] from the Dovyren Highlands, Buryatia.]]

[[Mongols|Mongolian people]] have lived around the area of Lake Baikal since the fifth century, with [[Mongolic peoples|Mongolic]]-related [[Slab Grave Culture|Slab Grave]] cultural monuments found in [[Lake Baikal|Baikal]] territory.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Chakars |first=Melissa |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878406217 |title=The socialist way of life in Siberia : transformation in Buryatia |date=2014 |isbn=978-963-386-014-4 |publisher=Central European University Press |location=Budapest |oclc=878406217}}</ref><ref>History of Mongolia, Volume I, 2003</ref> Over time, the Mongolic peoples of the regions developed into distinct groups, one of which became the Buryats. Further divisions of the Buryats came from those living on the western shore of Lake Baikal, with better land for agriculture, and those in the east, who practiced [[Nomad|nomadism]] more regularly and continued residing in moveable felt [[Yurt|yurts]]. As a result of the superior farmland, the western side of Lake Baikal was settled by European peasants during the time of the [[Russian Empire]] – western Buryats were more exposed to and influenced by the culture, religions, and economy of their European neighbors, whereas the eastern Buryats maintained closer ties to other Mongolic peoples, Buddhism, and Asian civilizations.<ref name=":1" />

The territory of Buryatia has been governed by the [[Xiongnu]] Empire (209 BC-93 CE) and Mongolian [[Xianbei state]] (93–234), [[Rouran Khaganate]] (330–555), [[First Turkic Khaganate]] (552-603), [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate]] (682-744), [[Tang dynasty]] (647–784), [[Uyghur Khaganate]] (744-840), [[Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate]] (840-1208), [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1368), and [[Northern Yuan]] (1368–1635).<ref name="HM">History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003</ref> Medieval Mongol tribes such as the [[Merkit]], [[Bayads]], [[Barga Mongols]] and [[Tumed|Tümeds]] inhabited Buryatia.<ref name="HM"/>

=== Imperial Russia ===
[[Cossacks]] and other tsarists officials began moving eastward into the western Buryat lands in 1625, where they estimated 30,000 Buryats were living in southeastern Siberia, collecting tribute from other, small Siberian tribes.<ref name=":1" /> The Buryats resisted the incorporation into the Russian Empire's tribute system (''[[yasak]]'') that demanded a yearly supply of [[Fur trade|furs]]; it was not until the 1680s that the last of the eastern Buryat lands were forced to participate in the yasak system. In 1666, the fort of Udinskoye was founded. This area later became known as Verkhneudinsk – in 1934, it was renamed Ulan-Ude, the present-day capital of Buryatia.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Quijada |first=Justine B. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1045640510 |title=Buddhists, shamans, and Soviets : rituals of history in post-Soviet Buryatia |date=2019 |isbn=978-0-19-091680-0 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY |oclc=1045640510}}</ref>

Buddhism was recognized as an official religion of the Russian Empire by [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] in 1741, with the first [[Pandito Khambo Lama]], the spiritual leader of Buryat Buddhists, elected in 1764. The first person to serve in this role was [[Damba Dorzha Zaiaev]] (1711–1776). At the time of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], [[Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov]] served as the 12th Pandito Khambo [[Lama]] of Eastern Siberia from 1911 to 1917.<ref name=":0" /> Itigilov stepped down in 1917 at the time of the revolution and later encouraged his students to flee to Mongolia, though he refused to flee himself.

=== Soviet Buryatia ===
National movements, including that of Buryatia, began to foment after the [[February Revolution]] in 1917. From March 1917, the leading Buryat [[intelligentsia]] organized a number of conferences in cities such as [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]], [[Irkutsk]], and Verkhneudinsk (present-day Ulan-Ude) and invited representatives from Buryat administrative districts of the [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] and [[Transbaikal|Transbaikalia]] regions. The culmination of these conferences was the first All-Buryat Congress in April 23–25, 1917 in Chita, where activists advocated for a self-governing Buryat Autonomous Region, based on the models of [[Poland]] and [[Finland]], with an elected body, the Buryat National Duma, that all Buryats, men and women, over the age of 18 and without criminal convictions, would participate in. This Duma would elect a permanent executive body, the Buryat National committee, which would take on responsibilities such as organizing the elections, assembling the Buryat Duma, and publishing works in the Buryat language.<ref name=":2" /> Among other topics discussed at the Congress were the establishment of an Education Council to create Buryat schools, trained educators, and curricula that included the history of the Buryats and Mongols and Buryat studies. 

After the November Revolution in 1917, the Buryats bid for independence was complicated by the arrival of a [[Japanese intervention in Siberia|Japanese expeditionary force]] into Buryatia in 1918.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1222777577 |title=Beyond Versailles : the 1919 moment and a new order in East Asia |date=2021 |author1=Toshihiro Minohara |author2=Evan N. Dawley |isbn=978-1-4985-5446-6 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham, Maryland |pages=81–98 |oclc=1222777577}}</ref> The Buryat national leaders saw the Japanese as potential and critical allies in assisting the independence movement, but the cooperation ultimately failed due to the conflicting agendas. [[Red Army|The Red Army]] advanced in Buryatia in 1920 and continued to [[Outer Mongolia]] in 1921. Attracted to the promises of [[self-determination]] and territorial autonomy by the [[Bolsheviks]], and having lost the cooperation of the Japanese, the Buryat leaders embraced the idea of building a Buryat nation with the new Soviet state. In 1923, the [[Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] ({{langx|bua|Буряадай Автономито Совет Социалис Республика}}; {{langx|ru|Бурятская Автономная Советская Социалистическая Республика}}) was created as a result of the merger of [[State of Buryat-Mongolia|State of Buryat]] and [[Buryat Oblast]] and promised territorial autonomy.
In 1929, a [[1929 Buryat Revolt|revolt was suppressed in Buryatia]], caused by collectivisation and repression of [[Buddhism]]. In 1937, [[Aga Buryatia]] and [[Ust-Orda Buryatia]] were detached from the [[Buryat-Mongolian ASSR]] and merged with [[Chita Oblast|Chita]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast]]s, respectively. In 1958, the name "Mongol" was removed from the name of the republic and simply became the [[Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Buryatia]] within the vast multi-ethnic, diverse Soviet Union. 

The [[Ivolginsky Datsan]] was opened in 1945 as the only Buddhist spiritual centre of the USSR, home to the [[Central Spiritual Board of Buddhists of the USSR]], the state-controlled [[sangha]].

The Buryat intelligentsia were active throughout Buryatia and beyond, into [[Tibet]] and Mongolia. At the turn of the 20th century, Buryats leaders, such as [[Batu-dalai Ochirov]] and Mikhail Bogdanov, began actively writing political articles about the threat to Buryatia and Buryat existence from Russia. Despite their noted influence from 1900 to 1930, most of them were [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purged]], killed outright or sent to [[Internment|concentration camps]], in the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rupen |first=Robert A. |date=1956 |title=The Buriat Intelligentsia |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2941876 |journal=The Far Eastern Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=383–398 |doi=10.2307/2941876 |jstor=2941876 |issn=0363-6917}}</ref> 

The leader of the Buryat ASSR from 1962 to 1984 was [[Andrei Urupkheevich Modogoev]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chakars |first=Melissa |date=2009-01-01 |title=Buryat Literature as a Political and Cultural Institution from the 1950s to the 1970s |url=https://brill.com/view/journals/inas/11/1/article-p47_4.xml |journal=Inner Asia |language=en |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=47–63 |doi=10.1163/000000009793066569 |issn=2210-5018}}</ref> In the 1970s, Soviet authorities began two major industrial projects in Buryatia: the [[Gusinoozerskii power station]] to the south of Ulan-Ude and the construction of the [[Baikal–Amur Mainline]] railway in northern Buraytia. The construction of both projects, particularly the railway, required recruiting campaigns to bring workers from other parts of the country to Buryatia. Towns developed along the railroad, and the urban population in northern Buryatia doubled between 1979 and 1989.<ref name=":1" /> In addition to the Russians who moved to Buryatia for work, Buryats from other parts of southern Siberia also migrated to the Buryat ASSR, particularly Ulan-Ude and other cities for jobs and educational opportunities. Prior to World War II, less than 10% of Buryats lived in urban areas, compared to almost half at the time of the fall of the Soviet Union. By 1989, one-third of the Buryat population of the Buryat ASSR was living in Ulan-Ude.

=== Post-Soviet Buryatia ===
The Buryat ASSR declared its [[sovereignty]] in 1990 and adopted the name ''Republic of Buryatia'' in 1992. However, it remained an autonomous republic within the [[Russian Federation]]. On 11 July 1995 Buryatia signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy.<ref name="asymmetries">{{Cite journal|last=Solnick|first=Steven|date=29 May 1996|title=Asymmetries in Russian Federation Bargaining|url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-08-Solnick.pdf|journal=The National Council for Soviet and East European Research|pages=12|access-date=6 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828112303/https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-08-Solnick.pdf|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> This agreement was abolished on 15 February 2002.<ref name="demokratiztsiya">{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|pages=146|access-date=2019-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308002915/http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|archive-date=2019-03-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], [[Autonomous republic|autonomous republics]] such as Buryatia did not have the right to secede. However they retained considerable [[autonomy]], with a separate legislature and president. However this autonomy has been curtailed following the 2004 law passed by [[Vladimir Putin]] that decreed regional governors and presidents were to be appointed, rather than directly elected.<ref name=":0" />

==Politics==
[[File:Buryat home2.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Buryat home with instruments, scrolls, and weapons typical of Buryatia.]]

The head of the Republic is the [[Head of the Republic of Buryatia|Head]] (formerly President), who the voters of the republic elect for a four-year term. From 2004 to 2012 the head of Buryatia (along with all other heads of regions in Russia) was nominated directly by the [[President of Russia|Russian President]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-elections-idUSBRE9310GR20130402|title=Putin signs law to allow him to pick Russian governors|first=Alissa de|last=Carbonnel|newspaper=Reuters |date=April 2, 2013|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://barentsobserver.com/en/politics/russia-reinstates-governor-elections|title=Russia reinstates governor elections|website=Barentsobserver}}</ref>

Between 1991 and 2007, the President was [[Leonid Potapov|Leonid Vasilyevich Potapov]], who was elected on July&nbsp;1, 1994, re-elected in 1998 (with 63.25% of votes), and then re-elected again on June&nbsp;23, 2002 (with over 67% of votes). Prior to the elections, Potapov was the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic—the highest post at that time.

The current Head of the Republic is [[Alexey Tsydenov]], who was elected by popular vote on 10 September 2017. Prior to this he was acting Head, having been appointed by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in February 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0868-new-head-of-buryatia-promises-boost-in-tourism-to-siberias-buddhist-region/|title=New head of Buryatia promises boost in tourism to Siberia's Buddhist region|website=siberiantimes.com}}</ref>

The Republic's [[parliament]] is the [[People's Khural of the Republic of Buryatia|People's Khural]], popularly elected every five years.  The People's Khural has 66&nbsp;deputies and is currently dominated by the country's ruling party, [[United Russia]], with 45 seats.

Traditionally, Buryats adhered to belief systems that were based on the deification of nature, belief in spirits, and the possibility of their magic influence on the surroundings. They were led by [[shamanism|shamans]], who systematized tribal beliefs and cults. From the second half of the 17th century, beliefs and cults in the shamanic form were displaced by [[Buddhism]], which became widespread in ethnic Buryatia. By the end of the 19th century, the majority of Buryats were part of the Buddhist tradition. A synthesis of Buddhism and traditional beliefs that formed a system of ecological traditions has constituted a major attribute of Buryat culture.<ref>[http://www.unspecial.org/2013/01/buryatia-a-symbol-of-eurasia-in-the-heartland-of-baikal Esuna Dugarova. Buryatia – a symbol of Eurasia in the heartland of Baikal.] [[UN Special (magazine)]]</ref> In 2003, the Local Religious Organization of Shamans, Tengeri was officially registered as a religious organization in Buryatia.<ref name=":0" />

As of a 2012 survey<ref name="2012ArenaAtlas"/> 27.4% of the population adheres to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], 19.8% to [[Buddhism]], 2% to the [[Slavic Native Faith]], [[Tengrism]] or Buryat [[shamanism]], 4% declares to be [[nondenominational Christianity|unaffiliated]] [[Christianity|Christian]] (excluding Protestants), 1% are Orthodox Christian believers without belonging to churches or are members of other [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox churches]], 1% are members of [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]]. In addition, 25% of the population declares to be "[[spiritual but not religious]]", 13% to be [[atheism|atheist]], and 10.8% follows another religion or did not give an answer to the survey.<ref name="2012ArenaAtlas"/>

[[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] are the most widespread religions in the republic. Many Slavs, who constitute around 67% of the population, are Russian Orthodox. Since the breakup of the USSR in 1991, a small number have converted to various Protestant denominations or to [[Rodnovery]], also known as the Slavic native faith. There are also some [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] among the Slavs. Most of the [[Germans]] (0.11% of the population) are also Orthodox, so are some other non-European groups like [[Armenians]] (0.23%), [[Georgians]] (0.03%), and [[Soyot]] (0.37%). Buryats constitute 30.04% of the total population.

Most urban Buryats are either Buddhist or Orthodox, while those in the rural areas often adhere to [[Yellow shamanism]], a mixture of shamanism and Buddhism, or to [[Black shamanism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shimamura|first1=Ippei|title=The Roots Seekers: Shamanism and Ethnicity among the Mongol Buryats|date=2014|publisher=Shumpusha Publishing|location=Yokohama, Tanagawa, Japan|isbn=978-4-86110-397-1}}</ref> There are also [[Tengrism|Tengrist]] movements. [[Siberian Tatars]] are around 0.7% of the population. However, due to isolation from the main body of Tatars, many of them now are either non-religious or Orthodox. [[Islam]] is followed by immigrant groups like [[Azeris]] and [[Uzbeks]], who constitute another 0.7% of the population.
