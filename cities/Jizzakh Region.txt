Other major towns include [[Doʻstlik, Jizzakh Region|Doʻstlik]], [[Gagarin, Uzbekistan|Gagarin]], [[Gʻallaorol]], [[Paxtakor]], and [[Dashtobod]]. Jizzakh Region was formerly a part of [[Sirdaryo Region]] but was given separate status in 1973.<ref name=ome>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://n.ziyouz.com/books/uzbekiston_milliy_ensiklopediyasi/O'zbekiston%20Milliy%20Ensiklopediyasi%20-%20J%20harfi.pdf|title=Жиззах вилояти|trans-title=Jizzakh Region|encyclopedia=[[National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan]]|pages=136–140|language=uz|year=2000–2005|location=Tashkent}}</ref>

==Economy==

The economy of the Jizzakh Region is primarily based on [[agriculture]]. [[Cotton]] and [[wheat]] are the main crops, and extensive [[irrigation]] is used. [[Natural resources]] include [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[iron]], and [[limestone]]. Uzbekistan and China are working together to jointly establish a [[Special Economic Zone]] in the region. This high-tech industrial park will be formally established by March 2013. The [[China Development Bank]] will provide a $50 million loan to finance several of the joint projects in the construction, agro-industrial and mechanical engineering sectors.<ref>{{cite news|title=Uzbekistan, China to Develop Special Economic Zone in Jizzakh|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/uzbekistan-china-to-develop-special-economic-zone-in-jizzakh/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=26 January 2013|publisher=Satrapia}}</ref>

The region has a well-developed [[transportation]] infrastructure, with over 2500&nbsp;km of surfaced roads.

==Geography==
The climate is a typically [[continental climate]], with mild winters and hot, dry summers.

The [[Zaamin National Park]], formerly Guralash Reserve, on the western slopes of the [[Turkestan Range]] and known for its unique fauna and flora, is also within the region.

[[Wildlife]] is extremely rich here; in spring and in summer, [[alpine meadow]]s are with a multitude of colors: bright-red [[tulips]] and snow-white [[acacias]]. In autumn the hills are magnificently decorated with the gold-colored domes of the [[hazelnut]] trees, columns of [[birch]]-trees, towering [[plane tree]]s, and green [[thicket]]s. High in the mountains, in the upper part of the [[Guralashsoy gorge]], is a nesting-place of [[black stork]]s. These rare birds are the pride and joy of Uzbekistan. They are written down in the "Redbooks" in many countries as an [[endangered species]]. Early in the spring when the [[Arnasoy depression]] is flooded, flocks of [[duck]]s, wild [[goose|geese]], [[pelican]]s and [[grey heron]]s are found here. This territory serves as a nesting place for [[rose-coloured starling]]s, [[shrike]]s, and [[sandpiper]]s.

==Districts==
[[Image:Jizzax viloyati nn.png|thumb|250px|right|Division of Jizzakh Region into tumans (districts)]]
