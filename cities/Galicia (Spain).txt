The interior of Galicia is characterized by a hilly landscape; mountain ranges rise to {{cvt|2000|m|ft}} in the east and south. The coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of [[ria]]s and beaches. The climate of Galicia is usually temperate and rainy, with markedly drier summers; it is usually classified as [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]]. Its topographic and climatic conditions have made [[animal husbandry]] and farming the primary source of Galicia's wealth for most of its history, allowing for a relatively high density of population.<ref>Galicia had a population of 1,345,803 inhabitants in 1787, some 44 inhabitants per square kilometer, out of a total of 9,307,804 in metropolitan Spain.

{{main|Name of Galicia}}
[[File:Land of Galicia, NASA satellite image.jpg|thumb|right|A satellite view of Galicia]]
The name ''Galicia'' derives from the Latin toponym Callaecia, later ''[[Gallaecia]]'', related to the name of an ancient Celtic tribe that resided north of the [[Douro]] river, the [[Gallaeci|Gallaeci or Callaeci]] in [[Latin]], or {{lang|grc|Καλλαϊκoί}} (''Kallaïkoí'') in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]].<ref name="Moralejo">{{cite book |last=Moralejo |first=Juan J. |title=Callaica nomina : estudios de onomástica gallega |year=2008 |publisher=Fundación Pedro Barrié de la Maza |location=A Coruña |isbn=978-84-95892-68-3 |pages=113–148 |url=http://ilg.usc.es/agon/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Callaica_Nomina.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322173004/http://ilg.usc.es/agon/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Callaica_Nomina.pdf |archive-date=2011-03-22 |url-status=live}}</ref> These ''[[Callaeci]]'' were the first tribe in the area to help the [[Lusitanians]] against the invading Romans. The Romans applied their name to all the other tribes in the northwest who spoke the [[Gallaecian language|same language]] and lived the same life.<ref>Luján, Eugenio R. (2000): "Ptolemy's 'Callaecia' and the language(s) of the '[[Callaeci]]', in ''Ptolemy: towards a linguistic atlas of the earliest Celtic place-names of Europe: papers from a workshop sponsored by the British Academy'', Dept. of Welsh, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, 11–12 April 1999, pp. 55–72. Parsons and Patrick Sims-Williams editors.</ref>

The toponymy of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors such as [[Isidore of Seville]], who wrote that "Galicians are called so, because of their fair skin, as the Gauls", relating the name to the Greek word for milk. (See the [[Galaxy#Etymology|etymology of the word ''galaxy'']].) In the 21st century, some scholars (J.J. Moralejo, Carlos Búa) have derived the name of the ancient Callaeci either from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *kl(H)-no- 'hill',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Búa |first1=Carlos |title=Toponimia prelatina de Galicia. |date=2018 |publisher=USC |location=Santiago de Compostela |isbn=978-84-17595-07-4 |url=https://www.usc.gal/libros/gl/lingstica/300-toponimia-prelatina-de-galicia-.html |page=213 |access-date=16 July 2021 |archive-date=16 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210716153613/https://www.usc.gal/libros/gl/lingstica/300-toponimia-prelatina-de-galicia-.html |url-status=live }}</ref> through a local relational [[suffix]] -aik-, also attested in [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]], so meaning 'the hill (people)'; or from [[Proto-Celtic]] *kallī- 'forest', so meaning 'the forest (people)'.<ref>Curchin, Leonard A. (2008) [http://estudiosgallegos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgallegos/article/view/41 Estudios Gallegos''The toponyms of the Roman Galicia: New Study''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625172742/http://estudiosgallegos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgallegos/article/view/41 |date=25 June 2017 }}. CUADERNOS DE ESTUDIOS GALLEGOS '''LV''' (121): 111.</ref><ref name="Moralejo" /> In any case, ''Galicia'', being ''per se'' a derivation of the ethnic name ''Kallaikói'', means 'the land of the Galicians'.

Another recent proposal comes from linguist [[Francesco Benozzo]] after identifying the root ''gall-'' / ''kall-'' in a number of Celtic words with the meaning "stone" or "rock", as follows: ''gall'' (old Irish), ''gal'' (Middle Welsh), ''gailleichan'' (Scottish Gaelic), ''kailhoù'' (Breton), ''galagh'' (Manx) and ''gall'' (Gaulish). Hence, Benozzo explains the ethnonym ''Callaeci'' as being "the stone people" or "the people of the stone" ("those who work with stones"), about the builders of the ancient [[megalith]]s and stone formations so common in Galicia.<ref>Benozzo, F. (2018) "Uma paisagem atlântica pré-histórica.

The name evolved during the Middle Ages from ''Gallaecia'', sometimes written ''Galletia'', to ''Gallicia''. In the 13th century, with the written emergence of the Galician language, ''Galiza'' became the most usual written form of the name of the country, being replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries by the current form, ''Galicia'', which is also the spelling of the name in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The historical denomination ''Galiza'' became popular again during the end of the 19th and the first three-quarters of the 20th century and is still used with some frequency today. The [[Xunta de Galicia]], the local [[devolved government]], uses ''Galicia''. The [[Royal Galician Academy]], the institution responsible for regulating the Galician language, whilst recognizing ''Galiza'' as a legitimate current denomination, has stated that the only official name of the country is ''Galicia''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fraga |first=Xesús |url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/galicia/2008/06/08/0003_6886803.htm |title=La Academia contesta a la Xunta que el único topónimo oficial es Galicia |trans-title=The Academy responds to the Xunta saying that the only official toponym is Galicia |newspaper=[[La Voz de Galicia]] |date=8 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131106/http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/galicia/2008/06/08/0003_6886803.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The oldest attestation of human presence in Galicia has been found in the Eirós Cave, in the municipality of [[Triacastela]], which has preserved animal remains and [[Neanderthal]] stone objects from the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. The earliest culture to have left significant architectural traces is the [[Megalithic]] culture, which expanded along the western European coasts during the [[Neolithic]] and [[Calcolithic]] eras. Thousands of Megalithic [[tumulus|tumuli]] are distributed throughout the country, mostly along the coastal areas.<ref>Antonio de la Peña Santos, [http://www.ctv.es/USERS/sananton/ponteved.pdf Los orígenes del asentamiento humano] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524105459/http://www.ctv.es/USERS/sananton/ponteved.pdf |date=24 May 2013 }}, (chapters 1 and 2 of the book ''Historia de Pontevedra'' A Coruña: Editorial Vía Láctea, 1996. p. 23.</ref> Within each tumulus is a stone burial chamber known locally as ''anta'' ([[dolmen]]), frequently preceded by a corridor. Galicia was later influenced by the Bell [[Beaker culture]]. Its rich mineral deposits of [[tin]] and [[gold]] led to the development of [[Bronze Age]] [[metallurgy]], and the commerce of bronze and gold items all along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe. A shared elite culture evolved in this region during the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]].

Dating from the end of the [[Megalithic]] era, and up to the [[Bronze Age]], numerous stone carvings ([[petroglyph]]s) are found in open air. They usually represent [[cup and ring marks]], [[labyrinth]]s, [[deer]], Bronze Age weapons, and riding and hunting scenes.<ref>{{cite book |last=de la Peña García |first=Antonio |title=Petroglifos de Galicia |year=2001 |publisher=Vía Láctea |location=Perillo-Oleiros (A Coruña) |isbn=84-89444-82-X}}</ref> Large numbers of these stone carvings can be found in the Rías Baixas regions, at places such as Tourón and [[Campo Lameiro]].

It is usually considered a local evolution of the Atlantic Bronze Age, with later developments and influences overlapping into the Roman era. Geographically, it corresponds to the people the Romans called [[Gallaeci]], which were composed of a large series of nations or tribes, among them the ''Artabri'', ''Bracari'', ''Limici'', ''Celtici'', ''Albiones'' and ''Lemavi''. They were capable fighters: [[Strabo]] described them as the most difficult foes the Romans encountered in conquering [[Lusitania]], while [[Appian]]<ref>''History of Rome: the Spanish Wars'', 72–73.</ref> mentions their warlike spirit, noting that the women bore their weapons side by side with their men, frequently preferring death to captivity. According to [[Pomponius Mela]] all the inhabitants of the coastal areas were [[Celts|Celtic people]].

Gallaeci lived in ''[[hill fort#Portugal and Spain|castros]]''. These were usually annular forts, with one or more concentric earthen or stony walls, with a trench in front of each one. They were frequently located on hills, or in seashore cliffs and peninsulas. Some well known ''castros'' can be found on the seashore at: Fazouro, Santa Tegra, Baroña, and O Neixón; and inland at: [[San Cibrao de Lás hill fort|San Cibrao de Lás]], Borneiro, Castromao, and Viladonga. Some other distinctive features, such as temples, baths, reservoirs, warrior statues, and decorative carvings have been found associated with this culture, together with rich gold and metalworking traditions.

The Roman legions first entered the area under [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus|Decimus Junius Brutus]] in 137–136 BC,<ref>Livy lv., lvi., ''Epitome''</ref> but the country was only incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] by the time of [[Augustus]] (29 BC – 19 BC). The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources, most notably gold. Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned, and [[Gallaeci]] served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language: [[latin language|Latin]]. The [[Roman Empire]] established its control over Galicia through camps (''castra'') as ''[[Aquis Querquennis]]'', Ciadella camp or [[Lugo|Lucus Augusti]] ([[Lugo]]), roads (''viae'') and monuments as the lighthouse known as ''[[Tower of Hercules]]'', in [[A Coruña|Corunna]], but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century AD, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of ''[[Romanization]]''. In the 3rd century, it was made a province, under the name Gallaecia, which included also northern Portugal, [[Asturias]], and a large section of what today is known as [[Castile and León]].

In the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the [[Roman Empire]] allowed different tribes of Central Europe ([[Suebi]], [[Vandals]] and [[Alans|Alani]]) to cross the [[Rhine]] and penetrate the rule on 31 December 406. Its progress towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]] forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (''foedus'') by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a [[Britons (historical)|Briton]] colony and bishopric (see [[Mailoc]]) was established in Northern Galicia ([[Britonia]]), probably as [[foederati]] and allies of the Suebi.<ref>{{Cite book |publisher=Toxosoutos |isbn=978-84-95622-58-7 |last=Young |first=Simon |title=Britonia: camiños novos |date=2002}}</ref> In 585, the [[Visigoth]]ic [[King Leovigild]] invaded the Suebic kingdom of Galicia and defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control.

Later the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Muslims]] invaded Spain (711), but the Arabs and [[Moors]] never managed to have any real control over Galicia, which was later incorporated into the expanding Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]], usually known as Gallaecia or Galicia (''Yillīqiya'' and ''Galīsiya'') by Muslim chroniclers,<ref>Cf.

[[File:Apóstoles del Pórtico de la Gloria.jpg|thumb|left|Partial view of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] interior of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]]]
In the 9th century, the rise of the cult of the [[James, son of Zebedee|Apostle James]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]] gave Galicia particular symbolic importance among Christians, an importance it would hold throughout the ''[[Reconquista]]''. As the Middle Ages went on, Santiago became a major pilgrim destination and the [[Way of Saint James]] (Camiño de Santiago) a major pilgrim road, a route for the propagation of [[Romanesque art]] and the words and music of the [[troubador]]s. During the 10th and 11th centuries, a period during which Galician nobility become related to the royal family, Galicia was at times headed by its own [[List of Galician monarchs|native kings]], while [[Vikings]] (locally known as ''Leodemanes'' or ''Lordomanes'') occasionally raided the coasts. The Towers of [[Catoira]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Eduardo Loureiro |url=http://www.catoira.net/ |title=Viking Festival webpage |publisher=Catoira.net |access-date=26 April 2010 |archive-date=6 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806232851/https://www.catoira.net/ |url-status=live }}</ref> (Pontevedra) were built as a system of fortifications to prevent and stop the Viking raids on Santiago de Compostela.

In 1063, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] divided his realm among his sons, and the Kingdom of Galicia was granted to [[Garcia II of Galicia]]. In 1072, it was forcibly annexed by Garcia's brother [[Alfonso VI of León]]; from that time Galicia was united with the [[Kingdom of León]] under the same monarchs. In the 13th century [[Alfonso X of Castile]] standardized the Castilian language (i.e. Spanish) and made it the language of court and government. Nevertheless, in his Kingdom of Galicia the [[Galician language]] was the only language spoken, and the most used in government and legal uses, as well as in [[Galician-Portuguese lyric|literature]].

[[File:Medieval baseball (El juego de la Pelota) in the Cantigas de Santa Maria.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] (13th century)]]
During the 14th and 15th centuries, the progressive distancing of the kings from Galician affairs left the kingdom in the hands of the local knights, counts, and bishops, who frequently fought each other to increase their fiefs, or simply to plunder the lands of others. At the same time, the deputies of the Kingdom in the ''[[Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia|Cortes]]'' stopped being called. The Kingdom of Galicia, slipping away from the control of the King, responded with a century of fiscal insubordination.

[[File:Un dos motivos centrais da Igrexa de Vilar de Donas.jpg|thumb|left|Gothic painting at Vilar de Donas' church, [[Palas de Rei]]]]
On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the ''[[Irmandiño|Guerras Irmandiñas]]'' ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of several knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Joanna La Beltraneja]], part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler [[Zurita y Castro, Jeronimo|Jeronimo Zurita]] defined as "doma del Reino de Galicia": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the ''Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia''), and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the [[Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia|''Xunta'' or ''Cortes'' of the Kingdom of Galicia]], an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.

The modern period of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]] began with the defeat of some of the most powerful Galician lords, such as Pedro Álvarez de Sotomayor, called [[Pedro Madruga]], and Rodrigo Henriquez Osorio, at the hands of the Castilian armies sent to Galicia between the years 1480 and 1486. [[Isabella I of Castile]], considered a usurper by many Galician nobles, defeated all armed resistance and definitively established the royal power of the Castilian monarchy. Fearing a general revolt, the monarchs ordered the banishing of the rest of the great lords like Pedro de Bolaño, Diego de Andrade, or Lope Sánchez de Moscoso, among others.

The establishment of the [[Santa Hermandad]] in 1480, and the [[Real Audiencia]] del Reino de Galicia in 1500—a tribunal and executive body directed by the [[Governor]]-[[Captain General]] as a direct representative of the King—implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown,<ref>{{cite book |last=Mariño Paz |first=Ramón |title=Historia da lingua galega |year=1998 |publisher=Sotelo Blanco |location=Santiago de Compostela |isbn=84-7824-333-X |page=195 |edition=2.}}</ref> after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination. As a result, from 1480 to 1520 the Kingdom of Galicia contributed more than 10% of the total earnings of the [[Crown of Castille]], including the Americas, well over its economic relevance.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rubio Martínez |first=Amparo |title=LOS INGRESOS EXTRAORDINARIOS DEL REINO DE GALICIA EN EL SIGLO XV |journal=Cuadernos de Estudios Gallegos |year=2010 |volume=LVII |issue=126 |page=268 |url=http://estudiosgallegos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgallegos/article/view/79/80 |access-date=4 July 2012 |archive-date=22 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622063601/http://estudiosgallegos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgallegos/article/view/79/80 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like the rest of Spain, the 16th century was marked by population growth up to 1580, when the simultaneous wars with the Netherlands, France, and England hampered Galicia's Atlantic commerce, which consisted mostly in the exportation of sardines, wood, and some cattle and wine.

In the late years of the 15th century the written form of the Galician language began a slow decline as it was increasingly replaced by Spanish, which would culminate in the ''Séculos Escuros'' "the Dark Centuries" of the language, roughly from the 16th century through to the mid-18th century, when written Galician almost completely disappeared except for private or occasional uses but the spoken language remained the common language of the people in the villages and even the cities.

From that moment Galicia, which participated to a minor extent in the American expansion of the [[Spanish Empire]], found itself at the center of the Atlantic wars fought by Spain against the French and the Protestant powers of England and the Netherlands, whose [[privateer]]s attacked the coastal areas, but major assaults were not common as the coastline was difficult and the harbors easily defended. The most famous assaults were upon the city of Vigo by [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] in 1585 and 1589, and the siege of [[A Coruña]] in 1589 by the ''[[English Armada]]''. Galicia also suffered occasional slave raids by [[Barbary pirates]], but not as frequently as the Mediterranean coastal areas. The most famous Barbary attack was the bloody sack of the town of [[Cangas do Morrazo|Cangas]] in 1617.<ref>{{cite book |last=Martínez Crespo |first=José |title=A guerra na Galicia do antigo rexime |year=2007 |publisher=Toxosoutos |location=Noia |isbn=978-84-96673-19-9 |pages=302–319}}</ref> At the time, the king's petitions for money and troops became more frequent, due to the human and economic exhaustion of Castile; the [[Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia]] (the local ''Cortes'' or [[representative assembly]]) was initially receptive to these petitions, raising large sums, accepting the conscription of the men of the kingdom, and even commissioning a new naval squadron which was sustained with the incomes of the Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |last=de Artaza |first=Manuel M. |title=Rey, reino y representación: la Junta General del Reino de Galicia (1599–1834) |year=1998 |publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas |location=Madrid |isbn=8445322494 |pages=231–325}}</ref>

[[File:Battle of Vigo bay october 23 1702.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Vigo Bay]], 23 October 1702]]
After the rupture of the wars with [[Portuguese Restoration War|Portugal]] and [[Reapers' War|Catalonia]], the ''Junta'' changed its attitude, this time due to the exhaustion of Galicia, now involved not just in naval or oversea operations, but also in an exhausting war with the Portuguese, war which produced thousands of casualties and refugees and was heavily disturbing to the local economy and commerce. So, in the second half of the 17th century the ''Junta'' frequently denied or considerably reduced the initial petitions of the monarch, and though the tension did not rise to the levels experienced in Portugal or Catalonia, there were frequent urban mutinies and some voices even asked for the secession of the Kingdom of Galicia.<ref>{{cite book |last=de Artaza |first=Manuel M. |title=Rey, reino y representación: la Junta General del Reino de Galicia (1599–1834) |year=1998 |publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas |location=Madrid |isbn=84-453-2249-4 |pages=325–345}}</ref>

===Late Modern and Contemporary===
[[File:Combat de la Corogne 16 janvier 1809 (ca. 1823) - Lecomte, Hippolyte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Corunna]] on 16 January 1809]]
During the [[Peninsular War]] the successful uprising of the local people against the new French authorities, together with the support of the [[British Army]], limited the occupation to six months in 1808–1809. During the pre-war period the Supreme Council of the Kingdom of Galicia (''Junta Suprema del Reino de Galicia''), auto-proclaimed interim sovereign in 1808, was the sole government of the country and mobilized near 40,000 men against the invaders.

The [[1833 territorial division of Spain]] put a formal end to the Kingdom of Galicia, unifying Spain into a single centralized monarchy. Instead of seven provinces and a regional administration, Galicia was reorganized into the current four provinces. Although it was recognized as a "historical region", that status was strictly honorific. In reaction, [[Galician nationalism|nationalist]] and [[federalism|federalist]] movements arose.

[[File:Batalla Elviña Eli2.jpg|thumb|left|Re-enactment of the [[Battle of Corunna]]]]
The [[liberalism|liberal]] General [[Miguel Solís Cuetos]] led a [[Solís Uprising|separatist coup attempt]] in 1846 against the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime of [[Ramón María Narváez]]. Solís and his forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Cacheiras]], 23 April 1846, and the survivors, including Solís himself, were shot. They have taken their place in Galician memory as the Martyrs of Carral or simply the Martyrs of Liberty.

Defeated on the military front, Galicians turned to culture. The ''[[Rexurdimento]]'' focused on the recovery of the Galician language as a vehicle of social and cultural expression. Among the writers associated with this movement are [[Rosalía de Castro]], [[Manuel Murguía]], [[Manuel Leiras Pulpeiro]], and [[Eduardo Pondal]].

In the early 20th century came another turn toward nationalist politics with ''[[Galician Solidarity|Solidaridad Gallega]]'' (1907–1912) modeled on ''[[Catalan Solidarity (1906)|Solidaritat Catalana]]'' in [[Catalonia]]. Solidaridad Gallega failed, but in 1916 ''[[Irmandades da Fala]]'' (Brotherhood of the Language) developed first as a cultural association but soon as a full-blown nationalist movement. [[Vicente Risco]] and [[Ramón Otero Pedrayo]] were outstanding cultural figures of this movement, and the magazine ''[[Nós (Galicia)|Nós]]'' ('Us'), founded in 1920, its most notable cultural institution, [[Lois Peña Novo]] the outstanding political figure.

The [[Second Spanish Republic]] was declared in 1931. During the republic, the [[Partido Galeguista (1931)|Partido Galeguista]] (PG) was the most important of a shifting collection of [[Galician nationalist]] parties. Following a referendum on a [[Galician Statute of Autonomy (1936)|Galician Statute of Autonomy]], Galicia was granted the status of an autonomous region.

Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist hands (Franco's army) throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the ''Seminario de Estudos Galegos''. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] provinces once those were conquered). According to [[Carlos Fernández Santander]], at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; [[Juana Capdevielle]], the wife of the governor of A Coruña; mayors such as [[Ánxel Casal]] of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists such as [[Jaime Quintanilla]] in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] and [[Emilio Martínez Garrido]] in [[Vigo]]; [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] deputies [[Antonio Bilbatúa]], [[José Miñones]], [[Díaz Villamil]], [[Ignacio Seoane]], and former deputy [[Heraclio Botana]]); soldiers who had not joined the rebellion, such as Generals [[Rogelio Caridad Pita]] and [[Enrique Salcedo Molinuevo]] and Admiral [[Antonio Azarola]]; and the founders of the PG, [[Alexandre Bóveda]] and [[Víctor Casas]],<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.parlamentodegalicia.es/sites/ParlamentoGalicia/BibliotecaBoletinsOficiais/B70262.pdf |title=Proposición no de ley del PSdeG-PSOE en el Parlamento de Galicia sobre Memoria Histórica |access-date=26 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403063902/http://www.parlamentodegalicia.es/sites/ParlamentoGalicia/BibliotecaBoletinsOficiais/B70262.pdf |archive-date=3 April 2010 |journal=Boletín Oficial del Parlamento de Galicia |issue=262 |date=21 December 2006 |language=es |pages=31146–31309}}</ref> as well as other professionals akin to republicans and nationalists, as the journalist [[Manuel Lustres Rivas]] or physician [[Luis Poza Pastrana]]. Many others were forced to escape into exile, or were victims of other reprisals and removed from their jobs and positions.
General [[Francisco Franco]] – himself a Galician from [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] – ruled as dictator from the civil war until he died in 1975. Franco's centralizing regime suppressed any official use of the Galician language, including the use of Galician names for newborns, although its everyday oral use was not forbidden. Among the attempts at resistance were small leftist guerrilla groups such as those led by [[José Castro Veiga]] ("O Piloto") and [[Benigno Andrade]] ("Foucellas"), both of whom were ultimately captured and executed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ernesto S. |last=Pombo |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ESPAnA/FRANQUISMO/ultimo/guerrillero/antifranquista/elpepiesp/19860310elpepinac_30/Tes/ |title=El último guerrillero antifranquista |newspaper=[[El País]] |date=10 March 1986 |access-date=18 February 2010 |publisher=[[Prisa]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109101412/http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ESPANA/FRANQUISMO/ultimo/guerrillero/antifranquista/elpepiesp/19860310elpepinac_30/Tes |archive-date=9 November 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Carlos |last=Fernández |url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2005/10/20/4177897.shtml |title=La cárcel acogió a huéspedes históricos |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702091104/http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2005/10/20/4177897.shtml |archive-date=2 July 2016 |newspaper=[[La Voz de Galicia]] |date=20 October 2005 |access-date=18 February 2010 |language=es}}</ref> In the 1960s, ministers such as [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne]] introduced some reforms allowing [[technocrat]]s affiliated with [[Opus Dei]] to modernize administration in a way that facilitated [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic development.

[[Unión Fenosa|Fenosa]], the monopolistic supplier of electricity, built hydroelectric dams, flooding many Galician river valleys.

The Galician economy finally began to modernize with a French [[Citroën]] factory in Vigo, the modernization of the canning industry and the fishing fleet, and eventually a modernization of small peasant farming practices, especially in the production of cows' milk. In the province of Ourense, businessman and politician [[Eulogio Gómez Franqueira]] gave impetus to the raising of livestock and poultry by establishing the [[Cooperativa Orensana S.A.]] (Coren).

During the last decade of Franco's rule, there was a renewal of nationalist feeling in Galicia. The early 1970s were a time of unrest among university students, workers, and farmers. In 1972, general strikes in Vigo and Ferrol cost the lives of Amador Rey and Daniel Niebla.<ref>{{cite news |first=María José |last=Portero |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109101418/http://www.elpais.com/articulo/economia/PONTEVEDRA/huelgas/importantes/elpepieco/19840304elpepieco_8/Tes |title=Las huelgas más importantes |newspaper=[[El País]] |date=4 March 1984 |access-date=2 November 2008 |archive-date=9 November 2011 |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/economia/PONTEVEDRA/huelgas/importantes/elpepieco/19840304elpepieco_8/Tes |publisher=[[Prisa]] |language=es}}</ref> Later, the bishop of [[Mondoñedo]]-[[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], [[Miguel Anxo Araúxo Iglesias]], wrote a pastoral letter that was not well received by the Franco regime, about a demonstration in [[Navantia|Bazán]] (Ferrol) where two workers died.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laregion.es/noticia/30559/Muere/Ourense/a%C3%B1os/ |title=Muere en Ourense a los 87 años el obispo emérito de Mondoñedo Miguel Anxo Araújo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191830/http://www.laregion.es/noticia/30559/Muere/Ourense/a%C3%B1os/ |archive-date=29 October 2013 |newspaper=[[La Región]] |date=23 July 2007 |access-date=3 November 2008 |language=es}}</ref>

As part of the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]] upon the death of Franco in 1975, Galicia regained its status as an autonomous region within Spain with the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, which begins, "Galicia, historical nationality, is constituted as an Autonomous Community to access to its self-government, in agreement with the [[Spanish Constitution]] and with the present Statute (…)". Varying degrees of [[Nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain|nationalist]] or independentist sentiment are evident at the political level. The ''[[Bloque Nacionalista Galego]]'' or BNG, is a conglomerate of [[left-wing]] parties and individuals that claims Galician political status as a nation.
[[File:Bandeira galega nacionalista.svg|thumb|[[Estreleira]], Galician nationalist flag]]

From 1990 to 2005, Manuel Fraga, former minister and ambassador in the Franco dictatorship, presided over the Galician autonomous government, the [[Xunta de Galicia]]. Fraga was associated with the ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'' ('People's Party', Spain's main national [[conservative]] party) since its founding. In 2002, when the oil tanker [[Prestige (oil tanker)|Prestige]] sank and covered the Galician coast in oil, Fraga was accused by the grassroots movement ''[[Plataforma Nunca Mais|Nunca Mais]]'' ("Never again") of having been unwilling to react. In the 2005 Galician elections, the 'People's Party' lost its absolute majority, though remaining (barely) the largest party in the parliament, with 43% of the total votes. As a result, power passed to a coalition of the ''[[Socialists' Party of Galicia|Partido dos Socialistas de Galicia]]'' (PSdeG) ('Galician [[Socialist]]s' Party'), a federal sister-party of Spain's main social-democratic party, the ''[[Partido Socialista Obrero Español]]'' (PSOE, 'Spanish Socialist Workers Party') and the nationalist ''[[Bloque Nacionalista Galego]]'' (BNG). As the senior partner in the new coalition, the PSdeG nominated its leader, [[Emilio Pérez Touriño]], to serve as Galicia's new president, with [[Anxo Quintana]], the leader of BNG, as its vice president.

In 2009, the PSdG-BNG coalition lost the elections, and the government went back to the People's Party (conservative), even though the PSdG-BNG coalition obtained the most votes.

===Topography===
[[File:Dende a Garita de Erbeira 01.JPG|thumb|left|Cliffs of [[Vixía Herbeira]] near [[Cape Ortegal]], the highest (613 m) in continental Europe]]
The interior of Galicia is a hilly landscape, composed of relatively low mountain ranges, usually below {{cvt|1000|m|ft}} high, without sharp peaks, rising to {{cvt|2000|m|ft}} in the eastern mountains. There are many rivers, most (though not all) running down relatively gentle slopes in narrow river valleys, though at times their courses become far more rugged, as in the canyons of the [[Sil (river)|Sil]] river, Galicia's second most important river after the [[Minho River|Miño]].

[[File:Prados en Pambre.jpg|thumb|Meadows in Pambre, [[Palas de Rei]]]]
Topographically, a remarkable feature of Galicia is the presence of many [[firth]]-like inlets along the coast, [[Estuary|estuaries]] that were drowned with rising sea levels after the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]]. These are called ''[[Ria|rías]]'' and are divided into the smaller ''[[Rías Altas]]'' ("High Rías"), and the larger ''[[Rías Baixas]]'' ("Low Rías"). The ''Rías Altas'' include Ribadeo, Foz, Viveiro, O Barqueiro, Ortigueira, Cedeira, Ferrol, Betanzos, A Coruña, Corme e Laxe and Camariñas. The Rías Baixas, found south of Fisterra, include Corcubión, Muros e Noia, [[Ría de Arousa|Arousa]], Pontevedra and Vigo. The Rías Altas can sometimes refer only to those east of [[Estaca de Bares Point|Estaca de Bares]], with the others being called ''Rías Medias'' ("Intermediate Rías").

Erosion by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] has contributed to the great number of [[cape (geography)|capes]]. Besides the aforementioned Estaca de Bares in the far north, separating the Atlantic Ocean from the Cantabrian Sea, other notable capes are [[Cape Ortegal]], Cape Prior, Punta Santo Adrao, Cape Vilán, Cape Touriñán (westernmost point in Galicia), [[Cape Finisterre]] or Fisterra, considered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], along with [[Finistère]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]], to be the end of the known world.

[[File:Ferrol City.jpg|thumb|left|The [[ria]] of Ferrol is an important naval base of Spain]]
All along the Galician coast are various [[archipelago]]s near the mouths of the ''rías''. These archipelagos provide protected deepwater harbors and also provide habitat for seagoing birds. A 2007 inventory estimates that the Galician coast has 316 archipelagos, islets, and freestanding rocks.<ref>[http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=3207_4_186724__Galicia-Xunta-elabora-inventario-islas-para-posible-compra ''La Xunta elabora un inventario de islas para su posible compra''] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323063539/http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=3207_4_186724__Galicia-Xunta-elabora-inventario-islas-para-posible-compra |date=23 March 2010 }}. FaroDeVigo.es. Retrieved 22 January 2009.</ref> Among the most important of these are the archipelagos of [[Cíes Islands|Cíes]], [[Ons Island|Ons]], and [[Sálvora]]. Together with [[Cortegada Island]], these make up the [[Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park]]. Other significant islands are Islas Malveiras, Islas Sisargas, and, the largest and holding the largest population, [[A Illa de Arousa|Arousa Island]].

The coast of this 'green corner' of the Iberian Peninsula, some {{cvt|1500|km|mi}} in length, attracts great numbers of tourists, although real estate development in the 2000–2010 decade has degraded it partially.

[[File:Tres Bispos, Ancares. Cervantes, Galiza.jpg|thumb|'Tres Bispos' peak, [[Cervantes, Lugo]]]]
Galicia is quite [[mountainous]], a fact which has contributed to isolate the rural areas, hampering communications, most notably in the inland. The main mountain range is the [[Macizo Galaico]] ([[Serra do Eixe]], [[Serra da Lastra]], [[Serra do Courel]]), also known as ''Macizo Galaico-Leonés'', located in the eastern parts, bordering with [[Castile and León]]. Noteworthy mountain ranges are [[O Xistral]] (northern [[province of Lugo|Lugo]]), the [[Serra dos Ancares]] (on the border with [[Province of León|León]] and [[Asturias]]), [[O Courel]] (on the border with León), [[O Eixe]] (the border between [[Province of Ourense|Ourense]] and [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]]), [[Serra de Queixa]] (in the center of Ourense province), [[O Faro]] (the border between Lugo and Pontevedra), [[Cova da Serpe]] (border of Lugo and A Coruña), [[Montemaior]] (A Coruña), [[Montes do Testeiro]], [[Serra do Suído]], and [[Faro de Avión]] (between Pontevedra and Ourense); and, to the south, [[A Peneda]], [[O Xurés]] and [[O Larouco]], all on the border of Ourense and [[Portugal]].

The highest point in Galicia is [[Trevinca]] or Pena Trevinca ({{convert|2124|m|ft|disp=or}}), located in the Serra do Eixe, at the border between Ourense and León and Zamora provinces.

===Hydrography===
[[File:Fragas do Eume.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Riparian]] forest on the banks of the [[Eume]]]]
Galicia is poetically known as the "country of the [[Rivers of Galicia|thousand rivers]]" ("o país dos mil ríos"). The largest and most important of these rivers is the [[Minho River|Miño]], poetically known as ''O Pai Miño'' (Father Miño), which is {{cvt|307.5|km|mi}} long and discharges {{cvt|419|m3|cuyd}} per second, with its affluent the [[Sil (river)|Sil]], which has created a spectacular canyon. Most of the rivers in the inland are tributaries of this river system, which drains some {{cvt|17027|sqkm|sqmi}}. Other rivers run directly into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or the [[Cantabrian Sea]], most of them having short courses. Only the [[Navia (river)|Navia]], [[Ulla (river)|Ulla]], [[Tambre]], and [[Limia]] have courses longer than {{cvt|100|km|mi}}.

Galicia's many [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams take advantage of the steep, deep, narrow rivers and their canyons. Due to their steep course, few of Galicia's rivers are navigable, other than the lower portion of the Miño and the portions of various rivers that have been dammed into reservoirs. Some rivers are navigable by small boats in their lower reaches: this is taken great advantage of in several semi-aquatic festivals and pilgrimages.

===Environment===
[[File:Canóns do Sil, Nogueira de Ramuín e Ribas de Sil.jpg|thumb|left|The River [[Sil (river)|Sil]] and its canyon]]
Galicia has preserved some of its dense forests. It is relatively unpolluted, and its landscapes composed of green hills, cliffs, and ''rias'' are generally different from what is commonly understood as Spanish landscape. Nevertheless, Galicia has some important environmental problems.

Deforestation and forest fires are a problem in many areas, as is the continual spread of the [[eucalyptus]] tree, a species imported from Australia, actively promoted by the paper industry since the mid-20th century. Galicia is one of the more forested areas of Spain, but the majority of Galicia's plantations, usually growing eucalyptus or pine, lack any formal management.<ref>Paula Pérez, [http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=3268_4_201060__Galicia-desorden-bosques ''El desorden de los bosques''] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323063619/http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=3268_4_201060__Galicia-desorden-bosques |date=23 March 2010 }}, FaroDeVigo.es.

Apart from tree plantations, Galicia is also notable for the extensive surface occupied by meadows used for animal husbandry, especially [[cattle]], an important activity. Hydroelectric development in most rivers has been a serious concern for local conservationists during the last decades.

Fauna, most notably the [[Eurasian wolf|European wolf]], has suffered because of the actions of livestock owners and farmers, and because of the loss of habitats, whilst the native deer species have declined because of hunting and development.

Oil spills are a major issue. The [[Prestige oil spill]] in 2002 spilled more oil than the [[Exxon Valdez]] in [[Alaska]].<ref name=new>Gaia Vince [https://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994100 Prestige oil spill far worse than thought] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208063142/http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994100 |date=2004-12-08 }} ''New Scientist'', August 27, 2003</ref>

===Biodiversity===
[[File:Dende a Garita de Erbeira 02.JPG|thumb|right|Galician Blond cows]]

Galicia has more than 2,800 plant species and 31 endemic plant taxa. Plantations and mixed forests of eucalyptus predominate in the west and north; a few oak forests (variously known locally as ''fragas'' or ''devesas'') remain, particularly in the north-central part of the province of Lugo and the north of the province of A Coruña (Fragas do Eume). In the interior regions of the country, oak and bushland predominate.
Galicia has 262 inventoried species of [[vertebrate]]s, including 12 species of freshwater fish, 15 [[amphibian]]s, 24 [[reptile]]s, 152 birds, and 59 mammals.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia Galega Universal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713074541/http://www.egu.es/ |title=A entrada de hoxe |archive-date=13 July 2008 |access-date=14 March 2019 |url=http://www.egu.es/ |language=gl}}</ref>

The animals most often thought of as being "typical" of Galicia are the livestock raised there. The [[Galician horse]] is native to the region, as is the [[Galician Blond]] cow and the domestic [[fowl]] known as the ''galiña de [[Mos (Spain)|Mos]]''.

Galicia is home to one of the largest populations of [[Iberian wolf|wolves]] in western Europe. Galicia's woodlands and mountains are also home to [[rabbit]]s, [[hares]], [[wild boar]]s, and [[roe deer]], all of which are popular with hunters. Several important bird migration routes pass through Galicia, and some of the community's relatively few environmentally protected areas are [[Special Protection Area]]s (such as on the Ría de Ribadeo) for these birds. From a domestic point of view, Galicia has been credited by the author [[Manuel Rivas]] as the "land of one million cows". [[Galician Blond]] and [[Holstein cattle]] coexist on meadows and farms.

==Climate==

[[File:Pacios, Serra do Courel, Galiza.jpg|thumb|left|Pacios, Courel, Lugo]]
Being located on the Atlantic coastline, Galicia has a very mild climate for the latitude and the marine influence affects most of the province to various degrees. In comparison to similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic, winters are exceptionally mild, with consistent rainfall. At sea level snow is exceptional, with temperatures just occasionally dropping below freezing; on the other hand, snow regularly falls in the eastern mountains from November to May. Overall, the climate of Galicia is comparable to the [[Pacific Northwest]]; the warmest coastal station of Pontevedra has a yearly mean temperature of {{convert|14.8|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1484C&k=gal |title=Climate normals for Pontevedra |publisher=Aemet.es |access-date=29 December 2015 |archive-date=1 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101021950/http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1484C&k=gal |url-status=live }}</ref> Ourense located somewhat inland is only slightly warmer with {{convert|14.9|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1690A&k=gal |title=Climate normals for Ourense |publisher=Aemet.es |access-date=29 December 2015 |archive-date=23 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723032655/http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1690A&k=gal |url-status=live }}</ref> Lugo, to the north, is colder, with {{convert|12|C|F}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1505&k=gal |title=Climate normals for Lugo |publisher=Aemet.es |access-date=21 June 2019 |archive-date=2 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902051600/http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1505&k=gal |url-status=live }}</ref> similar to the {{convert|12.45|C|F}} of [[Portland, Oregon]].

==Government and politics==

===Local government===
Galicia has partial self-governance, in the form of a [[devolved government]], established on 16 March 1978 and reinforced by the [[Galician Statute of Autonomy]], ratified on 28 April 1981. There are three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: the [[executive branch]], the [[Xunta de Galicia]], consisting of the President and the other independently elected councillors;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xunta.es/estatuto?lang=es#T1 |title=Estatuto de Autonomía de Galicia.

====Executive====
{{Main|Xunta de Galicia}}
[[File:Ayuntamiento de Santiago de Compostela edited.jpg|thumb|''Pazo de Raxoi'', in [[Santiago de Compostela]], seat of the presidency of the local devolved government]]
The Xunta de Galicia is a collective entity with executive and administrative power. It consists of the [[President of the Xunta of Galicia|President]], a vice president, and twelve councillors. Administrative power is largely delegated to dependent bodies. The Xunta also coordinates the activities of the provincial councils ({{langx|gl|deputacións}}) located in [[A Coruña]], [[Pontevedra]], [[Ourense]] and [[Lugo]].

The President of the Xunta directs and coordinates the actions of the Xunta. The president is simultaneously the representative of the [[autonomous community]] and of the Spanish state in Galicia. The president is a member of the parliament and is elected by its deputies and then formally named by the [[monarch of Spain]].

====Legislative====

The [[Parliament of Galicia|Galician Parliament]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Parlamento de Galicia – By Party |publisher=Parlamento de Galicia |url=http://www.parlamentodegalicia.com/contenido/ING/pags/grupo_pa.htm |access-date=27 November 2006 |quote=Parliament of Galicia Composition}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> consists of 75 deputies elected by [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] under a system of [[proportional representation]]. The franchise includes also Galicians who reside abroad. Elections occur every four years.

The last elections, held 12 July 2020, resulted in the following distribution of seats:<ref>{{cite web |title=Resultados definitivos: Galicia {{!}} Eleccións ao Parlamento de Galicia |url=https://resultados2020.xunta.gal/resultados/0/galicia |access-date=23 February 2023 |archive-date=5 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230305221831/https://resultados2020.xunta.gal/resultados/0/galicia |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Municipal governments===

[[File:Galicia250k_Parroquial_400dpi_comp9.png|thumb|Municipalities and parishes of Galicia]]
There are 314 [[municipalities]] ({{langx|gl|concellos}}) in Galicia, each of which is run by a [[mayor–council government]] known as a {{lang|gl|concello}}.

There is a further subdivision of local government known as an {{lang|gl|Entidade local menor}}; each has its own council ({{lang|gl|xunta veciñal}}) and mayor ({{lang|gl|alcalde da aldea}}). There are nine of these in Galicia: Arcos da Condesa, Bembrive, Camposancos, Chenlo, Morgadáns, Pazos de Reis, Queimadelos, [[Vilasobroso, Mondariz|Vilasobroso]] and Berán.

Galicia is also traditionally subdivided in some 3,700 civil [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]]es, each one comprising one or more ''vilas'' (towns), ''aldeas'' (villages), ''lugares'' (hamlets) or ''barrios'' (neighbourhoods).

===National government===
Galicia's interests are represented at the national level by 25 elected [[deputies]] in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] and 19 senators in the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] – of these, 16 are elected and 3 are appointed by the Galician parliament.

===Administrative divisions===
Before the [[1833 territorial division of Spain]], Galicia was divided into seven administrative [[provinces of Spain|provinces]]:<ref>The seven silver crosses on the [[coat of arms of Galicia (Spain)|coat of arms of Galicia]] refer to these seven historic provinces.</ref>

* [[A Coruña (province)|A Coruña]]
* [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]]
* [[Betanzos]]
* [[Province of Mondoñedo|Mondoñedo]]
* [[Lugo (province)|Lugo]]
* [[Ourense (province)|Ourense]]
* [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]]

From 1833, the seven original provinces of the 15th century were consolidated into four:

* [[A Coruña (province)|A Coruña]], capital: [[A Coruña]]
* [[Pontevedra (province)|Pontevedra]], capital: [[Pontevedra]]
* [[Ourense (province)|Ourense]]; capital: [[Ourense]]
* [[Lugo (province)|Lugo]]; capital: [[Lugo]]

<gallery mode="packed" heights="140" caption="Provinces of Galicia (location maps)">
Location A Coruña (Province).svg|A Coruña
Location Lugo (Province).svg|Lugo
Location Ourense (Province).svg|Ourense
Location Pontevedra (Province).svg|Pontevedra
</gallery>

Galicia is further divided into 53 ''[[comarcas of Spain|comarcas]]'', 315 [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] ([[Municipalities in A Coruña|93 in A Coruña]], [[Municipalities in Lugo|67 in Lugo]], [[Municipalities in Ourense|92 in Ourense]], [[Municipalities in Pontevedra|62 in Pontevedra]]) and 3,778 [[parroquia (Spain)|parishes]]. Municipalities are divided into parishes, which may be further divided into ''aldeas'' ("hamlets") or ''lugares'' ("places"). This traditional breakdown into such small areas is unusual when compared to the rest of Spain. Roughly half of the named population entities of Spain are in Galicia, which occupies only 5.8 percent of the country's area. It is estimated that Galicia has over a million named places, over 40,000 of them being communities.<ref>Manuel Bragado, [http://www.xornal.com/article.php3?sid=20050905120430 «Microtoponimia»] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101021950/http://www.xornal.com/article.php3?sid=20050905120430 |date=1 January 2016 }}, ''Xornal de Galicia'', 5 September 2005.

A major economic sector of Galicia is its fishing Industry; the main ports are [[port of A Coruña|A Coruña]], [[Port of Marín and Ria de Pontevedra|Marín-Pontevedra]], [[Port of Vigo|Vigo]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. Related to this fact, the [[European Fisheries Control Agency]], which coordinates fishing controls in [[European Union]] waters, is based in Vigo.

Galicia is a land of economic contrast. While the western coast, with its major population centers and its fishing and manufacturing industries, is prosperous and increasing in population, the rural hinterland—the provinces of [[Ourense]] and [[Lugo]]—is economically dependent on traditional agriculture, based on small landholdings called ''minifundios''. However, the rise of tourism, sustainable forestry, and organic and traditional agriculture are bringing other possibilities to the Galician economy without compromising the preservation of the natural resources and the local culture.

[[File:CITROËN C-ZERO, 2012, IFEVI.JPG|left|thumb|Electric cars are made in the [[Citroën]] factory in [[Vigo]].]]
Traditionally, Galicia depended mainly on agriculture and fishing. Nonetheless, today the [[tertiary sector]] of the economy (the service sector) is the largest, with 582,000 workers out of a regional total of 1,072,000 (as of 2002).

The [[secondary sector]] (manufacturing) includes [[shipbuilding]] in Vigo, [[Marín, Pontevedra|Marín-Pontevedra]] and Ferrol, textiles and granite work in A Coruña. A Coruña also manufactures [[automobile]]s. The French ''Centro de Vigo de [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]]'', founded in 1958, makes about 450,000 vehicles annually (455,430 in 2006);<ref>[http://www.eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/122733/12/06/Centro-Vigo-de-PSA-produjo-455430-vehiculos-en-2006-el-7-mas.html Centro Vigo de PSA produjo 455.430 vehículos en 2006, el 7% más] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722152047/http://www.eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/122733/12/06/Centro-Vigo-de-PSA-produjo-455430-vehiculos-en-2006-el-7-mas.html |date=22 July 2011 }} 21 December 2006.

Galicia is home to the [[Savings bank (Spain)|savings bank]], and to Spain's two oldest commercial banks [[Banco Etcheverría]] (the oldest) and [[Banco Pastor]], owned since 2011 by [[Banco Popular Español]].

Galicia was late to catch the tourism boom that has swept Spain in recent decades, but the coastal regions (especially the [[Rías Baixas]] and [[Santiago de Compostela]]) are now significant tourist destinations and are especially popular with visitors from other regions in Spain, where the majority of tourists come from. In 2007, 5.7&nbsp;million tourists visited Galicia, an 8% growth over the previous year, and part of a continual pattern of growth in this sector.<ref name="Turismo">{{cite web |url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/galicia/2008/01/02/00031199277292134844326.htm |title=Galicia recibió un 8% más de turistas durante el 2007 |date=2 January 2008 |access-date=19 February 2010 |archive-date=23 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323064818/http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/galicia/2008/01/02/00031199277292134844326.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> 85% of tourists who visit Galicia visit Santiago de Compostela.<ref name="Turismo" /> Tourism constitutes 12% of Galician [[GDP]] and employs about 12% of the regional workforce.<ref name="Turismo" />

Galicia's main airport is [[Santiago de Compostela Airport]]. Having been used by 2,083,873 passengers in 2014, it connects the Galician capital with cities in Spain as well as several major European cities. There are two other domestic airports in Galicia: [[A Coruña Airport]] – Alvedro and [[Vigo-Peinador Airport]].

The most important Galician fishing port is the [[Port of Vigo]]; It is one of the European's leading fishing ports, with an annual catch worth 1,500&nbsp;million euros.<ref>[http://www.galiciaparaelmundo.com/blog/index.php?page_id=51&reportaje_id=2504&name_page=Reportaje El Barrio Marinero] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913124109/http://www.galiciaparaelmundo.com/blog/?page_id=51&reportaje_id=2504&name_page=Reportaje |date=13 September 2019 }}, http://www.galiciaparaelmundo.com {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404075523/http://www.galiciaparaelmundo.com/ |date=4 April 2010 }}.</ref><ref>Antonio Figueras, [http://weblogs.madrimasd.org/ciencia_marina/archive/2008/05/30/93384.aspx ¡Y aún dicen que el pescado es caro!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607004523/http://weblogs.madrimasd.org/ciencia_marina/archive/2008/05/30/93384.aspx |date=7 June 2008 }}, weblogs.madrimasd.org/ciencia_marina</ref> In 2007 the port took in {{convert|732951|MT|LT ST}} of fish and seafood, and about {{convert|4000000|MT|LT ST}} of other cargoes.

{{nowrap|The Galician road network}} includes ''[[Highways in Spain|autopistas]]'' and ''[[autovía]]s'' connecting the major cities, as well as national and secondary roads to the rest of the municipalities. The [[Autovía A-6]] connects [[A Coruña]] and [[Lugo]] to [[Madrid]], entering Galicia at [[Pedrafita do Cebreiro]]. The [[Autovía A-52]] connects O Porriño, [[Ourense]] and [[Benavente, Zamora|Benavente]], and enters Galicia at [[A Gudiña]]. Two more autovías are under construction. [[Autovía A-8]] enters Galicia on the Cantabrian coast, and ends in [[Baamonde]] (Lugo province). [[Autovía A-76]] enters Galicia in [[Valdeorras]]; it is an upgrade of the existing [[N-120]] to Ourense.

Within Galicia are the [[Autopista AP-9]] from [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] to [[Portugal]] and the [[Autopista AP-53]] (also known as AG-53, because it was initially built by the Xunta de Galicia) from [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]] to Ourense. Additional roads under construction include [[Autovía A-54]] from Santiago de Compostela to Lugo, the [[Autovía A-57]] that will pass through [[Pontevedra]] and [[Autovía A-56]] from Lugo to Ourense. The Xunta de Galicia has built roads connecting [[comarca]]l capitals, such as the before mentioned AG-53, [[Autovía AG-55]] connecting A Coruña to [[Carballo]] or AG-41 connecting [[Pontevedra]] to [[Sanxenxo]].

[[File:Rail transport infrastructure map - ES - Galicia.svg|thumb|Rail transport infrastructure map of Galicia.]]
The first railway line in Galicia was inaugurated on 15 September 1873. It ran from [[O Carril, Vilagarcía da Arousa|O Carril]], [[Vilagarcía da Arousa]] to Cornes, [[Conxo, Santiago de Compostela]]. A second line was inaugurated in 1875, connecting A Coruña and Lugo. In 1883, Galicia was first connected by rail to the rest of Spain, by way of [[O Barco de Valdeorras]]. Galicia today has roughly {{convert|1100|km|mi}} of rail lines. Several {{RailGauge|1668mm|allk=on}} lines operated by [[Adif]] and [[Renfe Operadora]] connect all the important Galician cities. A {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} line operated by [[FEVE]] connects [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] to [[Ribadeo]] and [[Oviedo]]. An old electrified line is the [[Ponferrada]]-[[Monforte de Lemos]]-[[Ourense]]-[[Vigo]] line. Several [[high-speed rail]] lines are under construction. Among these are the [[Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia high-speed rail line]] that opened partly in 2011, and the [[AVE Atlantic Axis]] route, which will connect all of the major Galician Atlantic coast cities [[A Coruña]], [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Pontevedra]] and [[Vigo]] to Portugal.

===Population===
[[File:Galicia densidade parroq.PNG|thumb|right|Population density]]
{{main|Galician people}}
Galicia's inhabitants are known as Galicians ({{langx|gl|galegos}}, {{langx|es|gallegos}}). For well over a century Galicia has grown more slowly than the rest of Spain, due largely to a poorer economy compared with other regions of Spain and [[emigration]] to [[Latin America]] and to other parts of Spain. Sometimes Galicia has lost population in absolute terms. In 1857, Galicia had Spain's [[population density|densest]] population and constituted 11.5% of the national population. {{As of|2007}}, only 6.1% of the Spanish population resided in the autonomous community. This is due to an exodus of Galician people since the 19th century, first to [[South America]] and later{{when|date=February 2023}} to [[Central Europe]]{{where|date=July 2020}} and the development of population centers and industry in other parts of Spain.

According to the 2006 census, Galicia has a [[fertility rate]] of 1.03 children per woman, compared to 1.38 nationally, and far below the figure of 2.1 that represents a stable populace.<ref name="hijos">{{cite web |url=http://www.galicia-hoxe.com/index_2.php?idMenu=79&idNoticia=307692 |title=As lucenses son as que menos fillos teñen en España |work=Galicia-Hoxe.com |author=EFE |author-link=EFE |access-date=14 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301214952/http://www.galicia-hoxe.com/index_2.php?idMenu=79&idNoticia=307692 |archive-date=1 March 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Lugo and Ourense provinces have the lowest fertility rates in Spain, 0.88 and 0.93, respectively.<ref name="hijos" />

In northern Galicia, the [[A Coruña]]-[[Ferrol, A Coruña|Ferrol]] metropolitan area has become increasingly dominant in terms of population. The population of the city of A Coruña in 1900 was 43,971. The population of the rest of the province, including the City and Naval Station of nearby Ferrol and Santiago de Compostela, was 653,556. A Coruña's growth occurred after the [[Spanish Civil War]] at the same speed as other major Galician cities, but since the revival of democracy after the death of [[Francisco Franco]], A Coruña has grown at a faster rate than all the other Galician cities.

During the mid-20th century, the population rapidly increased in [[A Coruña]], Vigo, and to a lesser degree, other major Galician cities, such as [[Ourense]], [[Pontevedra]] or [[Santiago de Compostela]] as the rural population declined after the [[Spanish Civil War]]: many villages and hamlets of the four provinces of Galicia disappeared or nearly disappeared during the same period. [[Economic development]] and mechanization of agriculture resulted in the fields being abandoned, and most of the population moved to find jobs in the main cities.

===Migration===
Like many rural areas of Western Europe, Galicia's history has been defined by mass emigration. Significant internal migration took place from Galicia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the industrialized Spanish cities of [[Barcelona]], [[Bilbao]], [[Zaragoza]] and [[Madrid]]. Other Galicians emigrated to [[Latin America]] – [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] and [[Cuba]] in particular.

The two cities with the greatest number of people of Galician descent outside Galicia are [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, and nearby [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. Immigration from Galicia was so significant in these areas that Argentines and Uruguayans now commonly refer to all Spaniards as ''gallegos'' (Galicians).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=gallego |title=Gallegos |work=[[Real Academia Espanola]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226112019/http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=gallego |archive-date=26 December 2007 |access-date=14 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[Spain under Francisco Franco|Franco]] years, there was a new wave of emigration out of Galicia to other European countries, most notably to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Many of these immigrant or expatriate communities have their groups or clubs, which they formed in the first decades of settling in a new place. The [[Galician diaspora]] is so widespread that websites such as [[Fillos de Galicia]] have been created in the 21st century to organize and form a network of ethnic Galicians throughout the world.

After this, a third wave was a Spanish internal emigration to heavier industrialised areas of Spain, like the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] or [[Catalonia]].

The proportion of foreign-born people in Galicia is only 2.9 percent compared to the national figure of 10 percent; among the autonomous communities, only [[Extremadura]] has a lower percentage of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&path=/t20/e245&file=inebase&L= |work=[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112044915/http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&path=%2Ft20%2Fe245&file=inebase&L= |archive-date=12 January 2008 |title=Explotación estadística del Padrón |access-date=21 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Of the foreign nationals resident in Galicia, 17.93 percent are the ethnically related [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], 10.93 percent are [[Colombian people|Colombian]] and 8.74 percent [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]].<ref name="DossierGalicia" />

===Language===
{{Main|Galician language}}
[[File:ForoBoBurgo.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the oldest legal documents written in Galician, the ''Foro do bo burgo do Castro Caldelas'']]

Galicia has two official languages: Galician (Galician: ''galego'') and Spanish (also known in Spain as ''Castellano'', i.e. ''"Castilian"''), both of them [[Romance languages]]. The former (Galician) originated regionally; the latter (Castilian) was associated with [[County of Castile|Castile]]. Galician is recognized in the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia as the ''lingua propia'' ("own language") of Galicia.

Galician and Portuguese share a common medieval phase known as [[Galician-Portuguese]].<ref>{{citation |last=Fernández Rei |first=Francisco |title=Dialectoloxía da lingua galega |year=2003 |publisher=Edicións Xerais de Galicia |location=Vigo |isbn=84-7507-472-3 |edition=3 |page=17}}</ref> The independence of Portugal since the late Middle Ages has favored the divergence of the Galician and Portuguese languages as they developed.<ref name="ethnologue">[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glg Galician] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328094338/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glg |date=28 March 2008 }}), [[Ethnologue]]. Retrieved 19 February 2010.</ref> Though considered to be independent languages in Galicia, the shared history between Galician and Portuguese has been widely acknowledged; in 2014, the Galician parliament approved Law 1/2014 on the promotion of Portuguese and links with the [[Lusophony]].<ref>see [https://www.boe.es/eli/es-ga/l/2014/03/24/1/con full text of the law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731210721/https://www.boe.es/eli/es-ga/l/2014/03/24/1/con |date=31 July 2020 }}</ref>

The official Galician language has been standardized by the {{Lang|gl|[[Real Academia Galega]]|italic=no}} based on literary tradition. Although there are local dialects, Galician media conform to this standard form, which is also used in primary, secondary, and university education. There are more than three million Galician speakers in the world.<ref name="ethnologue" /> Galician ranks in the lower orders of the 150 most widely spoken languages on earth.<ref name="DossierGalicia" />

For more than four centuries of Castilian domination, Spanish was the only official language in Galicia. Galician faded from day-to-day use in urban areas. Since the re-establishment of democracy in Spain—in particular since the passage and implementation of the ''Lei de Normalización Lingüística'' ("Law of Linguistic Normalization", Ley 3/1983, 15 June 1983)—the first generation of students in mass education has attended schools conducted in Galician. (Spanish is also taught.)

Since the late 20th century and the establishment of Galicia's autonomy, the Galician language is resurgent. In the cities, it is generally used as a second language for most. According to a 2001 census, 99.16 percent of the population of Galicia understood the language, 91.04 percent spoke it, 68.65 percent could read it and 57.64 percent could write it.<ref name="lang-census">[http://www.xunta.es/linguagalega/arquivos/PNL22x24_textointegro).pdf Plano Xeral de Normalización da lingua galega] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215032113/http://www.xunta.es/linguagalega/arquivos/PNL22x24_textointegro%29.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219022556/http://xunta.es/linguagalega/arquivos/PNL22x24_textointegro).pdf |archive-date=2009-02-19 |url-status=live |date=15 February 2010 }}, Xunta de Galicia. (In Galician.) p. 38.</ref> The first two numbers (understanding and speaking) were roughly the same as responses a decade earlier. But there were great gains in the percentage of the population who could read and write Galician: a decade earlier, only 49.3 percent of the population could read Galician, and 34.85 percent could write it. During the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, the teaching of Galician was prohibited. Today older people may speak the language but have no written competence because of those years.<ref name="lang-census" /> Among the [[regional language]]s of Spain, Galician has the highest percentage of speakers in its population. However, the acts of Popular Party in the Autonomous Community in the last decade, forbide the possibility of teaching in Galician at schools such a vehicular language and use it in the learning of some subjects, increasingly the monolinguism and the language substitution of Galician.

The earliest known document in Galician-Portuguese dates from 1228. The ''Foro do bo burgo do Castro Caldelas'' was granted by [[Alfonso IX of León]] to the town of Burgo, in [[Castro Caldelas]], after the model of the constitutions of the town of [[Allariz]].<ref>[http://consellodacultura.org/mediateca/pubs.pdf/doc_en_galego.pdf/ O Foro do bo burgo do Castro Caldelas, dado por Afonso IX in 1228], Consello da Cultura Galega. Retrieved 19 February 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102220353/http://consellodacultura.org/mediateca/pubs.pdf/doc_en_galego.pdf/ |date=2 November 2013 }}</ref> A distinct [[Galician literature]] emerged during the Middle Ages: In the 13th century important contributions were made to the Romance canon in Galician-Portuguese, the most notable those by the [[troubadour]] [[Martín Codax]], the priest [[Airas Nunes]], King [[Dinis of Portugal|Denis of Portugal]], and King [[Alfonso X of Castile]], ''Alfonso O Sabio'' ("Alfonso the Wise"), the same monarch who began the process of standardization of the Spanish language. During this period, Galician-Portuguese was considered the language of love poetry in the Iberian [[Romance languages|Romance]] linguistic culture. The names and memories of Codax and other popular cultural figures are well preserved in modern Galicia.

[[Christianity]] is the most widely practised religion in Galicia. It was introduced in [[Late Antiquity]] and was practiced alongside the native Celtic religion for a few centuries which, incidentally, was re-established as an officially recognised religion in 2015.<ref>[https://durvate.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/e-oficial-its-official/ É oficial – It's official] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801213302/https://durvate.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/e-oficial-its-official/ |date=1 August 2018 }}, ''Irmandade Druídica Galaica'' (Pan-Galician Druidic Fellowship) (access 1 August 2018)</ref><ref>[https://maper.mjusticia.gob.es/Maper/DetalleEntidadReligiosa.action?numeroInscripcion=022549 Detalle de Entidad Religiosa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118165858/https://maper.mjusticia.gob.es/Maper/DetalleEntidadReligiosa.action?numeroInscripcion=022549 |date=18 January 2022 }}, a record of inscription with the [[Ministry of Justice (Spain)]] (access 18 January 2022)</ref> Still, today about 77.7% of Galicians identify as Catholic.<ref name=CIS2019Extremadura/> Most Christians adhere to Catholicism, though only 32.1% of the population described themselves as active members.

The [[Catholic Church]] in Galicia has had its primatial see in Santiago de Compostela since the 12th century. In fact, since the [[Middle Ages]], the Galician Catholic Church has been organized into five dioceses: the Metropolitan see [[Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela|Santiago de Compostela]], and four suffragan dioceses: [[Diocese of Lugo|Lugo]], [[Diocese of Ourense|Ourense]], [[Diocese of Mondoñedo-Ferrol|Mondoñedo-Ferrol]] and [[Diocese of Tui-Vigo|Tui-Vigo]]. While in the 15th-century diocesan boundaries may have coincided with those of the civil province, this is no longer the case. The five dioceses of Galicia are subdivided into a total of 163 districts and 3,792 parishes. In a minority of cases, the parish priest is represented by an administrator.

The patron saint of Galicia is [[Saint James the Greater]]. According to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition, his body was discovered in 814 near Compostela. After that date, the relics of Saint James attracted an extraordinary number of pilgrims. Since the 9th century these relics have been kept in the heart of the church – the modern-day [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|cathedral]] – dedicated to him. There are many other Galician and associated saints; some of the best-known are: [[Ansurius|Saint Ansurius]], [[Rudesind|Saint Rudesind]], [[Marina of Aguas Santas|Saint Mariña of Augas Santas]], [[Senorina|Saint Senorina]], Trahamunda and Froilan.

===Education===
Galicia's education system is administered by the regional government's Ministry of Education and University Administration. 76% of Galician teenagers achieve a [[high school diploma|high school degree]] – ranked fifth out of the 17 autonomous communities.

There are three [[public universities]] in Galicia: [[University of A Coruña]] with campuses in [[A Coruña]] and [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] with campuses in [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[Lugo]] and the [[University of Vigo]] with campuses in [[Pontevedra Campus|Pontevedra]], [[Ourense]] and [[Vigo]].

===Health care===
{{Main|Servizo Galego de Saúde}}
Galicia's [[Publicly funded health care|public healthcare]] system is the {{lang|gl|Servizo Galego de Saúde}} (SERGAS). It is administered by the regional government's Ministry of Health.

==Culture==
{{Main|Galician culture}}

===Architecture and Art===
[[File:Cathedral of Ourense (Spain).jpg|thumb|right|Romanesque façade in the Cathedral of [[Ourense]] (1160); founded in the 6th century, its construction is attributed to King [[Chararic (Suebian king)|Chararic]].]]
Hundreds of ancient standing stone monuments like [[dolmen]]s, [[menhir]]s, and megalithic [[Tumulus|tumuli]] were erected during the prehistoric period in Galicia. Amongst the best-known are the dolmens of Dombate, Corveira, Axeitos of Pedra da Arca, and menhirs like the Lapa de Gargantáns. From the [[Iron Age]], Galicia has a rich heritage based mainly on a great number of [[hill fort]]s, few of them excavated like Baroña, Sta. Tegra, San Cibrao de Lás and Formigueiros among others. With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture, there was a development of basilicas, [[castra]], city walls, cities, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, and the Roman bridge of [[Ponte Vella]]. It was the Romans who founded some of the first cities in Galicia like [[Lugo]] and [[Ourense]]. Perhaps the best-known examples are the [[Roman Walls of Lugo]] and the [[Tower of Hercules]] in [[A Coruña]].
[[File:Vista aérea del castillo de Pambre 6.JPG|thumb|left|The castle of Pambre, [[Palas de Rei]], which resisted the ''Irmandiños'' troops]]
During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by Galician feudal nobles to mark their powers against their rivals. Although most of them were demolished during the [[Irmandiño|Irmandiño Wars]] (1466–1469), some Galician castles that survived are Pambre, Castro Caldelas, [[Sobroso Castle|Sobroso]], [[Castle of Soutomaior|Soutomaior]] and Monterrei. The ecclesiastical architecture was raised early in Galicia, and the first churches and monasteries as San Pedro de Rocas began to be built in the 5th and 6th centuries. However, the most famous medieval architecture in Galicia had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in Galicia are the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]], the [[Ourense Cathedral]], [[Saint John of Caaveiro]], Our Lady Mary of [[Cambre]], and the [[Church of San Xoán, Portomarín|Church of San Xoán of Portomarín]] among others.
In the art of Galicia, the [[stone]] has a strong imprint, especially the [[granite]], which served as a support from the prehistoric [[petroglyphs]] figures to the development of medieval art in the Galician Romanesque sculptures from [[Portico of Glory]] by [[Master Mateo]], in [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]]. Medieval splendor was followed, as in literature, by a few centuries of darkness (the ''[[Séculos escuros]]'') until the arrival of the Compostela Baroque. In painting, the romanticism and impressionist-influenced landscapes of the 20th century were materialized by a generation of artists who died young, so they were called the "[[Xeración Doente]]" (Sick Generation). In the 20th century, the renovation came in the 20s by ''[[Os renovadores]]'', and by the ''[[Atlántica]]'' group after the dictatorship.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Galician cuisine}}
[[File:Polbo e empanada, Galiza.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Polbo á feira]]]]
Galician cuisine often uses fish and shellfish. The ''[[empanada]]'' is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top, and crust with the meat or fish filling usually being in a tomato sauce including onions and garlic. ''[[Caldo galego]]'' is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named [[Rapini|grelo (broccoli rabe)]]. The latter is also employed in ''lacón con grelos'', a typical carnival dish, consisting of pork shoulder boiled with ''grelos'', potatoes, and [[chorizo]]. ''[[Centolla]]'' is the equivalent of [[king crab]]. It is prepared by being boiled alive, having its main body opened like a shell, and then having its innards mixed vigorously. Another popular dish is [[octopus]], boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served on a wooden plate, cut into small pieces, and laced with olive oil, sea salt, and ''[[pimentón]]'' (Spanish paprika). This dish is called ''pulpo a la gallega'' or in Galician ''polbo á feira'', which roughly translates as 'fair-style octopus', most commonly translated as 'Galician-style octopus'. There are several regional varieties of cheese. The best-known one is the so-called ''[[tetilla cheese|tetilla]]'', named after its breast-like shape. Other highly regarded varieties include the San Simón cheese from [[Vilalba]] and the creamy cheese produced in the [[Arzúa]]-Ulloa area. A classical is ''filloas'', crêpe-like pancakes made with flour, broth or milk, and eggs. When cooked at a [[pig slaughter]] festival, they may also contain the animal's blood. A famous almond cake called ''[[Tarta de Santiago]]'' (St. James' cake) is a Galician sweet specialty mainly produced in Santiago de Compostela and all around Galicia.

Galicia produces a number of high-quality [[Galician wine]]s, including [[Albariño]], [[Ribeiro (DO)|Ribeiro]], [[Ribeira Sacra]], [[Monterrei]] and [[Valdeorras]]. The grape varieties used are local and rarely found outside Galicia and Northern Portugal. Just as notably from Galicia comes the spirit ''[[Augardente]]''—the name means burning water—often referred to as [[Orujo]] in Spain and internationally or as [[Orujo|caña]] in Galicia. This spirit is made from the distillation of the [[pomace]] of grapes.

{{Main|Galician Language#History}}
{{Listen|filename=Santa Maria.ogg|title="Santa Maria, strela do dia"|description=13th c. [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] (#100) |format=[[Ogg]]}}
As with many other [[Romance languages]], [[Galician-Portuguese]] emerged as a literary language in the Middle Ages, during the 12th and 13th centuries, when a [[Galician-Portuguese lyric|rich lyric tradition developed]], followed by a minor prose tradition, whilst being the predominant language used for legal and private texts till the 15th century. However, in the face of the hegemony of Spanish, during the so-called ''Séculos Escuros'' ("Dark Centuries") from 1530 to the late 18th century, it fell from major literary or legal written use.

[[File:Rosalía Castro de Murguía por Luis Sellier.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rosalía de Castro]].]]
As a literary language it was revived again during the 18th and, most notably, the 19th-century (''[[Rexurdimento]]'' ''Resurgence'') with such writers as [[Rosalía de Castro]], [[Manuel Murguía]], [[Manuel Leiras Pulpeiro]], and [[Eduardo Pondal]]. In the 20th century, before the Spanish Civil War the ''[[Irmandades da Fala]]'' ("Brotherhood of the Language") and ''[[Nós (Galicia)|Grupo Nós]]'' included such writers as [[Vicente Risco]], [[Ramón Cabanillas]] and [[Castelao]]. Public use of Galician was largely suppressed during the Franco dictatorship but has been resurgent since the restoration of democracy. Though written primarily in Castilian, several works by the Nobel laureate [[Camilo José Cela]], notably ''[[Mazurka for Two Dead Men]]'', are set in the author's native Galicia and make frequent allusions to Galician folklore, customs, and language. Other notable Galician authors who wrote mostly in Spanish, but always around Galician subjects, are [[Valle-Inclán]], [[Wenceslao Fernández Flórez]], [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]] and [[Gonzalo Torrente Ballester]]. Contemporary writers in Galician include [[Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín]], [[Manuel Rivas]], [[Chus Pato]], and [[Suso de Toro]].

====Festivals====
[[File:Peliqueiros de Laza.jpg|thumb|upright|''Entroido'': ''Peliqueiros'' in [[Laza, Spain|Laza]], allegedly dressed as 16th-century [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] tax collectors]]

* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Festa do Corpus Christi]] in [[Ponteareas]], has been observed since 1857 on the weekend following [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] (a [[movable feast]]) and is known for its floral carpets. It was declared a Festival of Tourist Interest in 1968 and a Festival of National Tourist Interest in 1980.
* [[Pontevedra Feira Franca|Feira Franca]], the first weekend of September, in [[Pontevedra]] recreates an open market that first occurred in 1467. The fair commemorates the height of Pontevedra's prosperity in the 15th and 16th centuries, through historical recreation, theater, animation, and demonstration of artistic activities. Held annually since 2000.
* [[Arde Lucus]], in June, celebrates the Celtic and Roman history of the city of Lugo, with recreations of Celtic weddings, Roman circus, etc.
* [[Bonfires of Saint John]], ''Noite de San Xoán'' or ''Noite da Queima'' is widely spread in all Galician territory, celebrated as a welcome to the [[summer solstice]] since the Celtic period, and Christianized in [[Midsummer|Saint John's day]] eve. Bonfires are believed to make ''meigas'' (malicious or fallen witches), flee. They are particularly relevant in the city of [[A Coruña|Corunna]], where it became [[Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiesta of National Tourist Interest of Spain]]. The whole city participates in making great bonfires in each district, whereas the centre of the party is located on the beaches of Riazor and Orzan, in the very city heart, where hundreds of bonfires of different sizes are lighted. Also, grilled sardines are very typical.
* Rapa das Bestas ("shearing of the beasts") in [[Sabucedo]], the first weekend in July, is the most famous of several ''rapas'' in Galicia and was declared a Festival of National Tourist Interest in 1963. Wild colts are driven down from the mountains and brought to a closed area known as a ''curro'', where their manes are cut and the animals are marked and assisted after a long winter in the hills. In Sabucedo, unlike in other ''rapas'', the ''aloitadores'' ("fighters") each take on their task with no assistance.
* Festival de Ortigueira ([[Ortigueira's Festival of Celtic World]]) lasts four days in July, in [[Ortigueira]]. First celebrated in 1978–1987 and revived in 1995, the festival is based on [[Celt]]ic culture, folk music, and the encounter of different peoples throughout Spain and the world. Attended by over 100,000 people, it is considered a Festival of National Tourist Interest.
* Festa da Dorna, 24 July, in [[Santa Uxía de Ribeira|Ribeira]]. Founded in 1948, declared a Galician Festival of Tourist Interest in 2005.

* Festas do Apóstolo Santiago (Festas of the Apostle James): the events in honor of the patron saint of Galicia last for half a month. The religious celebrations take place on 24 July. Celebrants set off [[fireworks]], including a pyrotechnic castle in the form of the façade of the cathedral.
* Romería Vikinga de Catoira ("[[Viking Festival of Catoira]]"), the first Sunday in August, is a secular festival that has occurred since 1960 and was declared a Festival of International Tourist Interest in 2002.

* Festa do marisco (Seafood Festival), October, in [[O Grove]]. Established in 1963; declared a Festival of National Tourist Interest in the 1980s.

In 2015 only five ''[[Bullfighting|corridas]]'' took place within Galicia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/10042/a-teima-en-triacastela-non-evita-o-esmorecemento-das-touradas-en-galicia/ |title=A teima en Triacastela non-evita o esmorecemento das touradas en Galicia |work=Praza Pública |language=gl |first=Miguel |last=Pardo |date=24 August 2015 |access-date=14 March 2019 |archive-date=21 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821130055/http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/10042/a-teima-en-triacastela-non-evita-o-esmorecemento-das-touradas-en-galicia/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
In addition, recent studies have stated that 92% of Galicians are firmly against bullfighting, the highest rate in Spain. Despite this, popular associations, such as ''Galicia Mellor Sen Touradas'' ("Galicia Better without Bullfights"), have blamed politicians for having no compromise to abolish it and have been very critical of local councils', especially those governed by the PP and PSOE, payment of subsidies for corridas. The province government of Pontevedra stopped the end of these subsidies and declared the province "free of bullfights".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/10218/a-deputacion-declara-pontevedra-libre-de-touradas-e-da-outro-paso-para-a-abolicion-en-galicia/ |title=A Deputación declara Pontevedra libre de touradas e dá outro paso para a abolición en Galicia |work=Praza Pública |language=gl |date=26 September 2015 |access-date=14 March 2019 |archive-date=30 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130113413/http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/10218/a-deputacion-declara-pontevedra-libre-de-touradas-e-da-outro-paso-para-a-abolicion-en-galicia |url-status=live }}</ref> The province government of A Coruña approved a document supporting the abolition of these events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/10126/a-deputacion-da-coruna-pide-por-ampla-maioria-a-abolicion-das-touradas/ |title=A Deputación da Coruña pide por ampla maioría a abolición das touradas |work=Praza Pública |language=gl |date=11 September 2015 |access-date=14 March 2019 |archive-date=12 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812214649/http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/10126/a-deputacion-da-coruna-pide-por-ampla-maioria-a-abolicion-das-touradas/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Media==

===Television===
[[Televisión de Galicia]] (TVG) is the autonomous community's public channel, which has broadcast since 24 July 1985 and is part of the [[Compañía de Radio-Televisión de Galicia]] (CRTVG). TVG broadcasts throughout Galicia and has two international channels, Galicia Televisión Europa and Galicia Televisión América, available throughout the [[European Union]] and the [[Americas]] through [[Hispasat]]. CRTVG also broadcasts a [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) channel known as [[G2 (TV channel)|tvG2]] and is considering adding further DTT channels, with a 24-hour news channel projected for 2010.

===Radio===
[[Radio Galega]] (RG) is the autonomous community's public radio station and is part of CRTVG. Radio Galega began broadcasting on 24 February 1985, with regular programming starting on 29 March 1985. There are two regular broadcast channels: Radio Galega and Radio Galega Música. In addition, there is a DTT and internet channel, Son Galicia Radio, dedicated specifically to Galician music.

Galicia has several free and community radio stations. [[Cuac FM]] is the headquarters of the Community Media Network (which brings together media non-profit oriented and serves their community). CUAC FM (A Coruña), Radio Filispim (Ferrol), Radio Roncudo (corme), Kalimera Radio (Santiago de Compostela), Radio Piratona (Vigo) and Radio Clavi (Lugo) are part of the Galician Network of Free and Association of Community Radio Broadcasters(ReGaRLiC)

===Press===
The most widely distributed newspaper in Galicia is ''[[La Voz de Galicia]]'', with 12 local editions and a national edition. Other major newspapers are ''[[El Correo Gallego]]'' ([[Santiago de Compostela]]), ''[[Faro de Vigo]]'' ([[Vigo]]), ''[[Diario de Pontevedra]]'' ([[Pontevedra]]), ''[[El Progreso (newspaper)|El Progreso]]'' (Lugo), {{Lang|es|[[La Región]]}} ([[province of Ourense|Ourense]]), and ''[[Galicia Hoxe]]'' – The first daily newspaper to publish exclusively in Galician. Other newspapers are ''[[El Diario de Ferrol|Diario de Ferrol]]'', the sports paper ''[[DxT Campeón]]'', ''[[El Ideal Gallego]]'' from A Coruña, the ''[[Heraldo de Vivero]]'', ''[[Atlántico Diario]]'' from Vigo and the ''[[Xornal de Galicia]]''.

==Sport==
Galicia has a long sporting tradition dating back to the early 20th century when the majority of sports clubs in Spain were founded. The most popular and well-supported teams in the region are [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] and [[Celta Vigo]]. When the two sides play, it is referred to as the [[Galician derby]]. Deportivo was champion of La Liga in the 1999–2000 season.

[[Pontevedra CF]] from [[Pontevedra]] and [[Racing de Ferrol|Racing Ferrol]] from [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] are two other notable clubs from Galicia as well as [[CD Lugo]] and [[SD Compostela]]. The [[Galician Football Federation]] periodically fields a [[Galicia national football team|national team]] against international opposition. This fact causes some political controversy because matches involving other national football teams different from the Spanish official national team threaten its status as the only national football team of the State. The policy of centralization in sport is very strong as it is systematically used as a patriotic device with which to build a symbol of the supposed unity of Spain which is a plurinational state.

Football aside, the most popular team sports in Galicia are [[futsal]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[basketball]]. In basketball, [[Obradoiro CAB]] is the most successful team of note, and currently, the only Galician team that plays in the [[Liga ACB]]; other teams are [[CB Breogan]], [[Club Ourense Baloncesto]] and OAR Ferrol. In the sport of handball, [[CB Cangas|Club Balonmán Cangas]] plays in the top-flight ([[Liga ASOBAL]]). The sport is particularly popular in the province of Pontevedra with the three other Galician teams in the top two divisions: SD Teucro (Pontevedra), Octavio Pilotes Posada (Vigo) and SD Chapela (Redondela).

In [[roller hockey]] [[HC Liceo La Coruña|HC Liceo]] is the most successful Galician team, in any sport, with numerous European and World titles. In futsal teams, [[Lobelle Santiago]] and Azkar Lugo.

Galicia is also known for its tradition of participation in water sports both at sea and in rivers; these include [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[yachting]], [[canoeing]] and [[surfing]]. Its athletes have regularly won medals in the Olympics; currently, the most notable examples are [[David Cal]], Carlos Pérez Rial, and Fernando Echavarri.

Galician triathlon contenders [[Francisco Javier Gómez Noya]] and [[Iván Raña]] have been world champions. In 2006 the cyclist Oscar Pereiro won the Tour de France after the disqualification of American Floyd Landis, gaining the top position on the penultimate day of the race. Galicians are also prominent athletes in the sport of mountaineering—Chus Lago is the third woman to reach the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen.

In 2022, the cycling race [[O Gran Camiño]] was held for the first time <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/gran-camino/2022/gc | title=Gran Camiño 2022 Stage 4 (ITT) results }}</ref> and was won by the Spanish legend [[Alejandro Valverde]]. In subsequent years, it rose to fame as the scene of the season debut of two times Tour de France winner [[Jonas Vingegaard]] who won the race in both 2023 and 2024.

===Emerging sports===
Since 2011, several [[Gaelic football]] teams have been set up in Galicia. The first was [[A Coruña Fillos de Breogán|Fillos de Breogán]] (A Coruña), followed Artabros (Oleiros), Irmandinhos (A Estrada), SDG Corvos (Pontevedra), and Suebia (Santiago de Compostela) with talk of creating a Galician league.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=531969343483189&set=pb.525085460838244.-2207520000.1351771499&type=3&theater |newspaper=[[Faro de Vigo]] |date=24 October 2012 |access-date=14 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101021950/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=531969343483189&set=pb.525085460838244.-2207520000.1351771499&type=3&theater) |archive-date=1 January 2016 |via=[[Facebook]] |language=es |title=Artigo aparecido no "Faro de Vigo" (edição Ponte Vedra) no 24/10/2012.

[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is growing in popularity, although the success of local teams is hampered by the absence of experienced ex-pat players from English-speaking countries typically seen at teams based on the Mediterranean coast or in the big cities. Galicia has a long-established Rugby Federation that organises its own women's, children's, and men's leagues. Galicia has also fielded a national side for friendly matches against other regions of Spain and Portugal. A team of ex-pat Galicians in [[Salvador, Brazil]] have also formed Galicia Rugby, a sister team of the local football club.

==Symbols==
{{Main|Coat of arms of Galicia (Spain)|Flag of Galicia}}
[[File:Escudo reino de galicia.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]] (''L'armorial Le Blancq'', c. 1560 AD).]]
A golden [[chalice]] enclosed in a field of [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] has been the symbol of Galicia since the 13th century. Originated as a [[Canting arms]] due to the phonetic similarity between the words "chalice" and ''Galyce'' ("Galicia" in old [[Norman language]]), the first documented mention of this emblem is on the ''Segar's Roll'', an English medieval [[roll of arms]] where are represented all the Christian kingdoms of 13th-century Europe. In the following centuries, the Galician emblem varied; diverse shapes and several numbers of chalices (initially three and later one or five) were used. It would not be until the 16th century that its number was fixed as one single chalice. Centuries after, a field of crosses was slowly added to the azure background, and latterly also a silver host. Since then, the emblem of the kingdom would be kept until now.

The ancient flag of the Kingdom of Galicia was based mainly on its [[coat of arms]] until the 19th century. However, when in 1833 the government of Spain abolished the kingdom and divided it into four provinces, the Galician emblem, as well as the flag, lost its legal status and international validity. It would not be until the late 19th century that some Galician intellectuals (nationalist politicians and writers) began to use a new flag as a symbol of renewed national unity for Galicia. That flag, which was composed of a diagonal stripe over a white background, was designated the "official flag of Galicia" in 1984, after the fall of Franco's dictatorship. In addition, the Royal Academy of Galicia asked the Galician government to incorporate the ancient coat of arms of the kingdom onto the modern flag, being present in it since then.

In addition to its coat of arms and flag, Galicia also has its own anthem. While it is true that the Kingdom of Galicia had an unofficial anthem known as the "Solemn March of the kingdom" for centuries, the current Galician anthem was not created until 1907, although its composition had begun already in 1880. Titled "[[Os Pinos]]" ("The Pines"), the Galician anthem's lyrics were written by [[Eduardo Pondal]], one of the greatest modern Galician poets, and its music was composed by Pascual Veiga. Performed for the first time in 1907 in [[Havana]] ([[Cuba]]) by Galician emigrants, the anthem was banned from 1927 by various Spanish governments until 1977 when it was officially established by the Galician authorities.
