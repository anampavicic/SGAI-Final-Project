== Etymology ==
The local belief behind the name of the city states there was a king in the 4th century, who on his pilgrimage halted at Lawson's Bay and built a temple dedicated to [[Vishakha|Vaisakha]], which was submerged under the sea, but the name of the temple became attached to the settlement.<ref name="etymology" /> Other historical names are, ''Kulotungapatnam'', named by the Chola King [[Kulottunga I]]; ''Ishakapatnam'', based on a Muslim Saint, Syed Ali Madani (Ishak Madani).<ref name="etymology">{{cite news|last1=Hatangadi|first1=Hatangadi|title=Vizag's hidden history|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/Vizags-hidden-history/articleshow/51075554.cms|access-date=16 May 2017|work=The Times of India|date=21 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812220832/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/Vizags-hidden-history/articleshow/51075554.cms|archive-date=12 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="etymology2">{{cite book|last1=Raju|first1=Rapaka Satya|title=Urban Unorganised Sector in India|publisher=Mittal Publications|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7fDs9fV3TsC&q=visakhapatnam+shortened+vizag&pg=PA69|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en|year=1989}}</ref> During the [[Company rule in India|East India Company rule in India]], the city was known with the name, ''Vizagapatnam''.<ref name="sepoymutiny">{{cite news|title=First Sepoy Mutiny took place in Vizag|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/%E2%80%98First-Sepoy-Mutiny-took-place-in-Vizag%E2%80%99/article15425171.ece|access-date=16 May 2017|work=The Hindu|date=4 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143449/http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/%E2%80%98First-Sepoy-Mutiny-took-place-in-Vizag%E2%80%99/article15425171.ece|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The suburb ''Waltair'' is another such name which was derived from the name the British colonial government used.<ref name="city of destiny" /> "Vizagapatnam" could also be spelled ''Visakhapatnam'' in the West European alphabet.

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name="history1" /><ref name="history2" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name="history3" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola dynasty]] king [[Kulottunga I|Kulothunga I]]. Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Empire|Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name="history1" /><ref name="history2" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name="history3" /> European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name="history1" /><ref name="history2" />

The city was ruled by the Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Visakha Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Viśakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Visakka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert Gopi messenger. Residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Viśakha. This is now inundated under seawater near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Viśakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutb Shahis]] (1571–1674), [[Kingdom of Jeypore]] (1535–1571) and (1674–1711), [[Mughal Empire]] (1711–1724), [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]] (1724–1757) and France (1757–1765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually established trading operations in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French colonial rule]] at the end of the 18th century.<ref name="history1" /><ref name="history2" />

The [[East India Company|British East India Company]] captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 Battle of Vizagapatnam and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].

=== Buddhist influence ===

Hindu texts state that during the fifth century BCE, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River|Godavari river]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a [[Buddhist]] empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Ancient Buddhist sites, recently excavated, are scattered across Visakhapatnam, reflecting the region's Buddhist legacy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-01 |title=Visakhapatnam declared as new capital of Andhra Pradesh |url=https://thearabianpost.com/visakhapatnam-declared-as-new-capital-of-andhra-pradesh/ |access-date=2024-09-06 |website=Arabian Post |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Pavurallakonda]] ("pigeon hill") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam. The Buddhist settlement found here is estimated to date back from the first century BCE to the second century CE. On the hillock (which overlooks the coastline) are 16 rock-cut [[cisterns]] for collecting rainwater. Gopalapatnam, on the Tandava River, is a village surrounded by brick stupas, [[vihara]]s, pottery and other Buddhist artefacts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pavuralakonda |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/Crying-out-to-be-preserved/articleshow/17607287.cms| work= The Times of India|access-date= 12 December 2012}}</ref>

In 1907 British archaeologist Alexander Rea unearthed Sankaram, a 2,000-year-old Buddhist site. The name "Śankaram" derives from the [[Sangharama]] (temple or monastery). Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century CE. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Gopal |first=B.

Nearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with several images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill. Among other Buddhist attractions are a relic casket, three [[chaitya]] halls, votive platforms, stupas and [[Vajrayana]] sculptures.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Patnaik |first=Santosh |date=2020-01-12 |title=INTACH efforts to protect Buddhist site bear fruit |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/intach-efforts-to-protect-buddhist-site-bear-fruit/article30552294.ece |access-date=2024-09-06 |work=The Hindu |language=en-IN |issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

==== Bavikonda ====
[[File:Bavikonda stupas.JPG|thumb|[[Bavikonda]] stupas|alt=Bavikonda Buddhist Complex]]

Bavikonda is an important Buddhist heritage site located on a hill about {{Convert|15|km|abbr=on}}, northeast of Visakhapatnam city. Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The word ''Bavikonda'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] means "a hill of wells". Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.

Excavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya, also referred to as a grand stupa, embedded with relic caskets,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-05-24 |title=Top 20 Buddhist Stupas in India – Earth is Mysterious |url=https://www.earthismysterious.com/top-buddhist-stupas-in-india/ |access-date=2024-01-01 |language=en-US}}</ref> a large Vihara (monastery) complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BCE to the second century CE. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=buddhist-tourism.com|access-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref>

About {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about {{Convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations from 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite news |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| newspaper= The Hindu|date = 18 June 2015|access-date= 18 June 2015}}</ref>

=== Later history ===
[[File:Mor Sjanua Regimental Cemetery near Jagadamba junction, Vizag.jpg|thumb|Mor Sjanua Regimental Cemetery near Jagadamba junction]]
The territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]] and the [[Gajapati Empire|Gajapati kings]]  from the 10th century to the 16th century CE. Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. In the late 16th century, it came under the direct rule of the [[Suryavanshi clan|Suryavanshi]] king, [[Vishwanath Dev Gajapati|Maharaja Vishwanath Dev Gajapati]] of [[Jeypore]]. However, from 1571 to 1674 it fell under the control and administration of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutb Shahi]] kings of [[Golconda Fort|Golconda]] who appointed a governor or [[Faujdar]] to collect taxes in the region. This Faujdar governed the area from [[Srikakulam]] or Chicacole as it was then known. In 1674, the Maharaja of Jeypore, Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Foujdar and claimed sovereignty from the deteriorating Qutb Shahis.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last1=Senapati|first1=Neelmani|last2=Sahu|first2=Nabin Kumar|date=1966|title=Orissa District Gazetteers: Karaput|url=http://indianculture.gov.in/gazettes/orissa-district-gazetteers-karaput|access-date=25 April 2021|website=INDIAN CULTURE|publisher=Government of Odisha|page=73|language=en}}</ref> Vishwambhar is also said to have defeated the Dutch East India Company who allegedly abducted locals, mostly fishermen living by the sea-shore. Later his descendant, Maharaja Raghunath Krishna Dev defeated the Seer Lascer appointed by the Mughals and maintained his rule over the region. Therefore, Visakhapatnam remained a part of the [[Kingdom of Jeypore]] until the death of Maharaja Ram Chandra Dev I in 1711 after which it was taken over by the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] who could only govern it for a few decades before transferring it to the British.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Singh Deo|first=Kumar Bidyadhar|title=Nandapur: A Forsaken Kingdom|publisher=Utkal Sahitya Press|year=1971|location=Cuttack|pages=69}}</ref> Even in the colonial era, the kings of Jeypore were referred to as the Maharaja or Raja of Vizagapatnam.<ref>{{Cite web|title=South Indian; India - Sword and scabbard (talwar)|url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/38131/sword-and-scabbard-talwar|access-date=25 April 2021|website=www.rct.uk|language=en}}</ref> European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products. The British developed Visakhapatnam as a prominent harbour on the east coast. The old port in [[Jalari Peta]] was built and used by the Maharaja of Jeypore who also owned several ships. During the [[World War I|First World War]], [[Vikram Dev III|Maharaja Vikram Dev III]] sent his fleet of ships to aid the British and later donated the port to the British government of Madras.<ref name=":1" /> It is now a fish market.

Local legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Viśakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Sankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Viśakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |date=15 July 2002 |access-date=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |work=[[The Hindu]] |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British Raj|British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence, it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.

Part of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.

On 7 May 2020, the city suffered an industrial accident when a polymer plant leaked toxic [[styrene]] gas, as it restarted operations after the [[COVID-19 lockdown in India|Coronavirus lockdown]]. This [[Visakhapatnam gas leak|gas leak]] killed at least eleven people, and drew comparisons to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gettleman|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Raj|first2=Suhasini|last3=Schultz|first3=Kai|last4=Yasir|first4=Sameer|date=7 May 2020|title=Gas Leak in India at LG Factory Kills 11 and Sickens Hundreds|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/world/asia/india-lg-gas.html|access-date=7 May 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
