{{nihongo|'''Hakodate'''|函館市|Hakodate-shi}} (formerly written as Hakodadi) is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] and [[seaports of Japan|port]] located in [[Oshima Subprefecture]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]]. It is the capital city of Oshima Subprefecture. As of January 31, 2024, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 239,813 with 138,807 [[household]]s, and a [[population density]] of 354 persons per km² (920 persons per mi²). The total area is {{convert|677.86|km2}}. The city is the third biggest in Hokkaido after [[Sapporo]] and [[Asahikawa, Hokkaido|Asahikawa]].

== History ==
Hakodate was Japan's first city whose port was opened to foreign trade in 1854, as a result of [[Convention of Kanagawa]], and used to be the most important port in northern Japan. Also, the city had been the biggest city in Hokkaido before [[Great Fire of Hakodate]] in 1934.

=== Pre-Meiji restoration ===
Hakodate (like much of other parts of Hokkaido), was originally populated by the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. The name "Hakodate" may have originated from an Ainu word, "hak-casi" ("shallow fort"). Another possibility is that it means "box" or "building" in Japanese which refers to the castle built by the Kono (Kano) clan in the fifteenth century.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |year=1996 |isbn=1-884964-04-4 |editor-last=Schellinger |editor-first=Paul |location=Chicago |pages=317–320 |editor-last2=Salkin |editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

Hakodate was founded in 1454, when Kono Kaganokami Masamichi constructed a large manor house in the fishing village of Usukeshi, the word for bay in Ainu.

After his death, Masamichi's son, Kono Suemichi, and family were driven out of Hakodate into nearby [[Kameda District, Hokkaido|Kameda]] during the Ainu rebellion in 1512 and little history was recorded for the area during the next 100 years. There was constant low-level conflict in the Oshima peninsula at the time with the Ainu, as armed merchants like the Kono family, established bases to control trade in the region. This conflict culminated in an uprising from 1669 to 1672, led by Ainu warrior [[Shakushain's Revolt|Shakushain]] after which the Ainu in the region were suppressed. <ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g50046g&brand=ucpress Capitalism from Within: Economy, Society, and the State in a Japanese Fishery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511072332/http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft1g50046g&brand=ucpress |date=2020-05-11}}, David L. Howell, University of California Press 1995, retrieved 29 June 2007</ref>

Hakodate flourished during the [[Hoei|Hoei period]] (1704–11), and many new temples were founded in the area. The town's fortunes received a further boost in 1741 when the [[Matsumae clan]], which had been granted nearby areas on the [[Oshima Peninsula]] as a [[marches|march fief]], moved its Kameda magistracy to Masamichi's house in Hakodate.

In 1779, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] took direct control over Hakodate, which triggered rapid development in the area. Merchant [[Takadaya Kahei]], who is honoured as the founder of Hakodate port, set up trading operations, which included opening the northern [[Etorofu]] sea route to the [[Kuril Islands|Kuril]] island fisheries. He is credited with turning Hakodate from a trading outpost into a thriving city. A Hakodate magistracy was established in 1802.<ref>[http://www.city.hakodate.hokkaido.jp/kikaku/english/overview.html City of Hakodate official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601053547/http://www.city.hakodate.hokkaido.jp/kikaku/english/overview.html |date=2007-06-01 }}, loaded 3 April 2007</ref> By 1807, the power of the Tokugawa government extended to the entire region. However, in 1821, the central government relaxed their control of the area and restored the Matsumae clan to the full powers they had before.<ref name=":0" />

=== Meiji restoration ===
The port of Hakodate was surveyed by a fleet of five U.S. ships in 1854 under the conditions of the Convention of Kanagawa, as negotiated by Commodore [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]].

Hakodate port partially opened to foreign ships for provisioning in the following year and then completely to foreign trade on 2 June 1859 as one of five Japanese open ports designated in the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States – Japan)|1858 Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] signed with the U.S. The [[Hakodate foreign settlement]] is one of the legacies of foreign influence in Hakodate.

A mariner in Perry's fleet died during a visit to the area and became the first U.S. citizen to be buried in Japan when he was interred in Hakodate's [[Foreign cemeteries in Japan|cemetery for foreigners]].

British merchant, naturalist and spy, [[Thomas Blakiston]], took up residence in Hakodate in the summer of 1861 to establish a saw milling business. He stayed in Hakodate until 1884, during which time he documented the local natural environment, equipped the local meteorological station and ran guns to the [[Boshin War]] rebels.<ref>Japan in Yezo, Thomas Wright Blakiston, Yokohama: Japan Gazette, 1883.

As one of few points of Japanese contact with the outside world, Hakodate was soon host to several overseas consulates. The Russian consulate included a chapel from where [[Nicholas of Japan]] is credited with introducing [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] to Japan in 1861 (now the [[Japanese Orthodox Church]]). The Orthodox church is neighbored by several other historical missionary churches, including [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Catholic]].

Hakodate also played a central role in the [[Boshin War]] between the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the [[Meiji Emperor]] which followed Perry's opening of Japan. Shogunate rebel [[Enomoto Takeaki]] fled to Hakodate with the remnants of his navy and his handful of French advisers in winter 1868, including [[Jules Brunet]]. They formally established the [[Republic of Ezo]] on December 25. The republic tried unsuccessfully to gather international recognition to foreign legations in Hakodate, including the Americans, French, and Russians. The [[Naval Battle of Hakodate]] was fought from 4 to 10 May 1869, between the remnants of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] navy and the newly formed [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. It was a decisive victory for the Imperial Japanese Navy.

On 14 June 1868, Hakodate was designated as an urban prefecture (府 fu), one of the first two, the other being [[Kyoto]]. On February 8, 1882, it was enlarged into Hakodate-ken, and then became part of [[Hokkaido]] on January 26, 1886.

The rebels occupied Hakodate's famous European-style [[Goryōkaku]] [[fort]] and used it as the centre of their defences in southern Hokkaido. Government forces defeated the secessionists in the [[Battle of Hakodate]] in 1869 and the city and fort were surrendered to emperor. Military leader, [[Hijikata Toshizō]], was one of those slain in the fighting.

In 1878, [[Isabella Bird]] reported of the city in her travelogue: 
<blockquote>The streets are very wide and clean, but the houses are mean and low. The city looks as if it had just recovered from a conflagration. The houses are nothing but tinder… Stones, however, are its prominent feature. Looking down upon it from above you see miles of grey boulders, and realise that every roof in the windy capital is "hodden doun" by a weight of paving stones.</blockquote>

Hakodate was awarded [[city]] status on August 1, 1922. On March 21, 1934, a serious fire had destroyed around two-thirds of all the buildings in Hakodate. This event also led to many residents leaving and subsequently depopulating the city.<ref name=":0" /> The city escaped most of the ravages of World War II. Areas around Hakodate-yama were fortified and access restricted to the public. Many prisoners of war were interned in Hakodate and historians record a total of 10 camps.<ref>[http://www.mansell.com/pow_resources/camplists/hokkaido/hakodate_area_camps.html Hakodate POW Camp Group: Camp Histories 1942 TO 1945] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611101634/http://www.mansell.com/pow_resources/camplists/hokkaido/hakodate_area_camps.html |date=2007-06-11}}, ''Center for Research Allied Pows under the Japanese'', loaded 29 June 2007.</ref> The city was subjected to two Allied bombing raids on 14 and 15 July 1945. Around 400 homes were destroyed on the western side of Hakodate-yama and an Aomori-Hakodate ferry was attacked with 400 passengers killed.

In 1976, a defecting [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pilot named [[Viktor Belenko]] flew his plane into the civilian airport in Hakodate.

Hakodate's size nearly doubled on December 1, 2004, when the town of Minamikayabe (from [[Kayabe District, Hokkaido|Kayabe District]]), and the towns of Esan and Toi, and the village of Todohokke (all from [[Kameda District, Hokkaido|Kameda District]]), were merged into it.

Hakodate is located at the center of Kameda Peninsula. The city is overlooked by [[Mount Hakodate]]. The summit can be reached by hiking trail, [[Mt. Hakodate Ropeway|cable car]], or by car. Visitors can also reach the peak of Mount Hakodate by taking tour bus and/or direct bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://planetyze.com/en/japan/hokkaido/mt-hakodate/information|title=About Mt.

An obscure local nickname of the bumpy mountain is ''Gagyūzan'' (Mount Cow's Back), alluding to the way the mountain resembles a resting cow.

The former [[Goryōkaku]] fort is now used in as a public park and is popular in Hokkaido for ''[[hanami]]'' (cherry blossom viewing). Since April 2006, the park has also featured the tall, white Goryōkaku Tower. Resembling an air traffic control tower, the structure offers a panoramic view of the park, including mainland Japan across the [[Tsugaru Strait]] on clear days.

=== Climate ===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Hakodate's climate is Hot Summer [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfa'') of hot summers and winters with regular intense [[blizzard]]s. With an alternate definition, using the {{cvt|-3|°C}} isotherm, Hakodate falls in the [[Humid subtropical climate|Humid Subtropical Climate]] (''Cfa'') commonly found on the east coast of the continents. The warmest month has an average temperature of {{cvt|22.1|°C}}. And so the city is the limit of hot summer climates for a city on the immediate coast in [[Japan]] (''Cfa''/''Dfa''), although appearing in other interior regions of the province.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://portais.ufg.br/up/68/o/Classifica____o_Clim__tica_Koppen.pdf |title=Koppen Climate Classification |access-date=2018-10-08 |archive-date=2019-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412021303/https://portais.ufg.br/up/68/o/Classifica____o_Clim__tica_Koppen.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hakodate has snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Winters are cold for the latitude (the same as [[Northern California]]) but milder than much of Hokkaido.

Hakodate features four distinct seasons. The city sees a substantial amount of snowfall during the course of the year, averaging roughly {{cvt|380|cm|in}} of snow annually. Spring typically begins with some snowfall, but sees a gradual warming trend as the season progress. Summers are generally warm but not hot, with average high temperatures in the warmest month (August) hovering around {{cvt|26|°C}}. Fall initially is warm but becomes increasingly colder as the season progress. It is not uncommon to see snowfall in the latter parts of the fall season.
