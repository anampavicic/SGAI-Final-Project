'''Lower Juba''' ({{langx|so|Jubbada Hoose}}, {{langx|ymm|Jubithy Hoosy}}, {{langx|ar|جوبا السفلى}}, {{langx|it|Basso Giuba}}) is an administrative region (''[[Administrative divisions of Somalia|gobol]]'') in southern [[Somalia]].<ref name="Cwfsom">{{cite web|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/somalia/|access-date=6 December 2013}}</ref> With its capital at [[Kismayo]], it lies in the [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous]] [[Jubaland]] region. It has green forests and wildlife including lions, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles, and hyenas.

Lower Juba is bordered by [[Kenya]], the Somali regions of [[Gedo]], [[Middle Juba]] (Jubbada Dhexe), and the Somali Sea. The province is named after the [[Jubba River]] that passes through it and empties into the Somali Sea at [[Goobweyn]]. The [[Lag Badana National Park]] is situated in Lower Juba.

==History==
In the latter half of the 20th century, a few [[Darod]] families started to settle in Kismayo city, which was then surrounded by the [[Bajuni]] people and other smaller groups. By the turn of the 20th century they had established a small business centres. In the beginning of the Somali civil wars, Kismaio known as Waamo faced a massive destruction{{clarification needed|date=September 2022}} among the faction leaders mainly between 
Different Darood sub-clans each claiming the ownership of the Lower & Middle Juba regions with the USC trying to encroach. However, the city subsequently evolved into a major hub of the livestock trade.<ref name="Cassanelli">Lee V. Cassanelli, ''The shaping of Somali society: reconstructing the history of a pastoral people, 1600–1900'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.102.</ref> The main [[Darod]] representatives to establish themselves in Kismayo were [[Marehan]], [[Harti]] and [[Absame]], as well aw [[Sheikhaal]] and [[Gaaljecel]] traders from the northeastern [[Ras Hafun]] promontory, who were referred to as ''Hafuuni''. In the first two decades of the 20th&nbsp;century, members of the [[Marehan]] clan of [[Darod]] were the first to build a few settlements in modern day [[Kismayo]] and [[Harti]] and [[Sheikhaal]] clans followed suit.<ref name="Greenst">[https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/oxfam/bitstream/10546/122751/4/bk-somali-conflict-part4-010194-en.pdf Greenstone - Kismayo]</ref>

Between 1974 and 1975, a major drought referred to as the ''Abaartii Dabadheer'' ("The Lingering Drought") occurred in the northern regions of Somalia. The [[Soviet Union]], which at the time maintained strategic relations with the [[Siad Barre]] government, airlifted some 90,000 people from the devastated regions of [[Hobyo]] and [[Caynaba]]. New small settlements referred to as ''Danwadaagaha'' ("Collective Settlements") were then created in Jubbada Hoose (Lower Jubba) and [[Jubbada Dhexe]] (Middle Jubba) regions. The transplanted families were also introduced to farming and fishing techniques, a change from their traditional pastoralist lifestyle of livestock herding.{{cn|date=September 2022}}
