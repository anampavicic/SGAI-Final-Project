'''Daet''' ({{IPA|tl|daʔet|IPA}}), officially the '''Municipality of Daet''' ({{lang-bcl|Banwaan kan Daet}}; {{lang-tl|Bayan ng Daet}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] and capital of the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Camarines Norte]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 111,700 people making it the most populous in the province.{{PH census|current}}

The municipality is a popular [[surfing]] spot among surfers worldwide. It is also home to the annual Daet International Aerosports Show which is first held in 2013. Daet is {{convert|342|km}} from [[Manila]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Daet'' was derived from the Bikol word ''dai-daitan'' which means, ''close to each other''. ''Daet'' also originated from ancient Bicol term ''daet'' which, according to the first Bicol Spanish Dictionary ''[[Vocabulario de la Lengua Bicol]]'' authored by Fray Marcos de Lisboa, would mean "to make friend" or "to be reconciled".{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}

===Pre-colonial period===

Daet was already an old community even before the discovery of the [[Philippines]] by [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] in 1521. An ancient tomb unearthed in the [[Bicol Region|Bicol region]] revealed references described in the [[Panayam]] manuscripts known to oriental history as corresponding to the first half of the thirteenth century. The early settlers were believed to be direct descendants of the group of datus who escaped from the court of [[Brunei]] to evade the enmity of a ruling [[rajah]].

===Spanish colonial period===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2022}}
In 1571, [[Juan de Salcedo]] arrived at the [[Bicol Region]] in quest for gold found in [[Camarines Norte]] and discovered that Daet was already a thriving settlement and noted that the houses were clustered together for reason of safety and protection. In June 1583, through a Franciscan Order confirmed the founding of Doctrinas including Daet.

Long after the implantation of the Spanish sovereignty, Don [[Juan de Salcedo]], "talented, dashing grandson of [[Miguel López de Legazpi]]" found this community in the course of an expedition in search of gold which the Camarines mountains were heart to abound, marking the beginning of over a three-century Spanish regime patterned after the sword and the cross.

In the meantime, an incident happened in the court of [[Spain]] over the romances of a woman which pressed the King to exile a Spanish noble to the Philippines who eventually chose to come this way to spend the rest of his life, forget all, and start life anew. This noble was Don Manuel de la Estrada, Marquis de Camarines, who devoted a lifetime to help implement the Spanish colonization blueprint in the building of a new town over our old community. He supervised the construction of the church as it stands today, the old Spanish to exile a Spanish noble to the Philippines who eventually bridge (now covered by a [[Bailey bridge]]), other stone bridges buildings. He also brought the first [[abaca]] seedlings and encouraged its cultivation which has given the Philippines the world monopoly of hemp fiber. Incidentally, from the union of this noble to a Filipino woman followed a long line of blood relation which still link most of the old families of this community. The ruins of the palatial mansion of the Marquis de Camarines were still visible in recent years, on the spot where the new building of the Provincial Capitol now stands.

Except for recurring raids by the [[Moro people|Moro]] pirates who occasionally came on their fast frail vintas to pillage this community causing the fortification of barrio Mercedes (now an independent municipality since 1948) during the Spanish regime, this community lived progressively in blissful peace and contentment. Formerly, the whole of the present Province of Camarines Norte was known as the District of Daet and this capital was a "Comandancia" of the original province of Camarines during the Spanish regime. In the few times that the Province of Camarines Norte was separated from and again fused with Camarines Sur from the Spanish to the American regimes, Daet always retained her importance as the provincial capital. In the ensuing changes, this municipality lost further much of her territory which was restored to Camarines Sur, and due to the segregation of the Municipality of [[Basud]] which was a former barrio of this community in the year 1908.

No less than thirteen martyrs were contributed by this community before the altar of liberty. They were butchered or burned alive and buried in a common grave during the Holy Week on Easter Sunday, April 1898. The local "insurrectus", however, made a remarkable feat in the last days of the Spanish regime when they succeeded in containing the Spanish local garrison and subjected them under relentless attack. The Spaniards were dramatically saved from annihilation by burning at the timely arrival of their rescue ship. Daet today takes a distinct pride for owning the first monument ever erected in the Philippines in honor of the foremost Filipino hero and martyr, Dr. Jose P. Rizal Protacio y Mercado, at the inspiration of Don Antonio Sans, Commanding Officer of the Philippine Revolutionary Forces in the sector.

===American colonial period===
The [[Philippine–American War]] had a minimal impact on this town. American forces arrived unopposed on March 4, 1900, while most of the rest of the Bicol Region had already been subdued by Major McNamee, operating under the overall command of General Bates. Commander Antonio Sans had previously negotiated the terms of surrender in Camarines Sur, which were acceptable to the American command. The progress achieved by this community during the American regime has yet to be commemorated in the bold letters of gold. This period laid the foundation for the present-day progress of the current generation.
