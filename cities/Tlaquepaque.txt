== History ==
The name ''Tlaquepaque'' derives from [[Nahuatl]] and means "place above clay land". The area is famous for its pottery and blown glass.
Before the [[Spain|Spaniards]] arrived on these lands, the [[Toluquilla]], [[Zalatitán]], [[Coyula]], [[Tateposco]], Tlaquepaque, [[Tapechi]] (Tepetitlán), and [[Tequepexpan]], formed with [[Tonalá (Jalisco)|Tonalá]] a kingdom, ruled by a woman named [[Cihualpilli Tzapotzinco]]. It was inhabited by Tonalteca Indians and later by the tecos that were in place at the arrival of the Spaniards. It was a pre-Hispanic town settled on a hill where they built houses of grass, reaching 500 inhabitants.
In March [[1530]] he arrived in these lands [[Nuño de Guzmán]] and his people, entering [[San Martín de las Flores]], formerly called Tlaxicoltzingo. Knowing the natives of the approach of the Spaniards, they were divided into two sides, because while Queen Cihualpilli and some gentlemen opted to give them a peaceful reception given their invincible power, others pretended to be resisted. The supporters of peace sent to the meeting of the Spaniards a delegation composed of nobles and rulers of the various peoples of the kingdom.
From the town of Tlaquepaque were Coyotl, Chitacotl and Tonatl, Xonatic, Cuauhuntin and Oceotl, from the town of Tetlán, Coyopitzantli from Tzalatitán, Timoac and Oxatl, from Atemaxac, Ipac, from Ichcatlán, and Tzacamitl from Xocatic gift of chickens, eggs, honey, ahuacates, onions and some fruits to tell them that they already had news of their coming and that they were waiting for them amicably Guzmán well received by the Queen of Tonalá, being baptized with the name of Juana Bautista Danza. This name was the winner of a raffle that made names such as Petra, Micaela and Juana. Dance was chosen because it arranged a dance in honor of the Spaniards.
Before entering the city, it sent several of its men to require the rebels who obtained in response a great shouting and a rain of arrows. Those who opposed confronted Guzman's army; The result of the meeting was unfavorable for the natives of the earth. All the rebels were captained by the lord of Tetlan, Tlaquitehuitli, and also by the Indian nobles Cuautipizahuac, and Catipamatac. On 25 March 1530, Nuño de Guzmán took possession of the kingdom of Tonalá and the subject peoples, including Tlaquepaque.
In 1548, the town received the name of San Pedro, at the suggestion of [[Fray Antonio de Segovia]], and during the colonial era and throughout the nineteenth century, he was only known by that name. From the second half of the sixteenth century it acquired the character of corregimiento subject to the jurisdiction of the city of [[Guadalajara (Mexico)|Guadalajara]]. Once the Spaniards settled in Guadalajara, they began to exercise political and religious control in the surrounding towns, and the authorities of the incipient Pearl Tapatia ordered that San Pedro deliver a tribute according to the number of inhabitants and in accordance with their occupations. In that way, in 1551 they came and made the order clear to the encomendero that this tribute be fulfilled. San Pedro, according to the same census that was taken for the tax transaction, had 1416 inhabitants living in 177 jacales. The tribute they imposed was four loads of grass a day, ten chickens from Castile, ten loads of firewood and five service Indians a week, thirty blankets, forty tapatios, twenty pairs of quills, six loaves of salt and two jugs of honey, every two months, and four hundred hanegas of corn and twenty hanegas of chili every year.
In the year 1600, San Pedro had fewer inhabitants than Toluquilla, which today belongs to Tlaquepaque. [[Alonso de la Mota and Escobar]] said:
{{quote | Leaving, then, from Guadalajara on the road that falls further to the east, one goes to the town of San Pedro of one hundred Indian neighbors}}

[[File:Municipal presidential balcony.jpg|alt=Municipal presidential balcony|thumb|'''Municipal presidential balcony''']]

By 1621, San Pedro was a doctrine of Franciscan religious from the convent of Guadalajara. On the morning of 26 November 1810, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Hidalgo]] made his entrance to San Pedro where he was presented with a feast, and in the afternoon he entered the capital triumphantly.

The priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla arrives in San Pedro Tlaquepaque, on Sunday, 25 November, from Atequiza Jalisco. It was arranged to take for your best comfort, the most comfortable house, you will be served a great banquet at noon, and at night a refreshment with all visitors, from the church and the government. Making preparations to leave San Pedro Tlaquepaque towards the capital today Guadalajara with around 7,000 men. Arriving around noon at the gates of the cathedral.
In 1821, San Pedro Tlaquepaque was the cradle of the proclamation of the '' 'Independence of Jalisco' '' by the brigadier [[Pedro Celestino Negrete]], since the document is signed in the town on 13 June of the same year . According to the decree of 27 March 1824, San Pedro became a member of the Guadalajara Department. In 1825, San Pedro is registered as a town.

* Juarez Street.
* [[Sanctuary of the Holy Mexican Martyrs]] – The martyrs gave their lives for Christ and for Our Lady, so this sanctuary fulfills the mission of remembering those who with their blood fed the faith of the Mexican people. In fact, most of these martyrs were from Guadalajara or passed through this city during the persecution of the 1920s. Today, recalls Héctor Castellanos, the Guadalajara seminary has about 1,000 seminarians and is one of the most important in the world. The origin of the construction has a double slope, on the one hand because of the needs of the Diocese when it comes to mass acts, and on the other of a desire of St. John Paul II to investigate and give value to the Mexican victims of religious persecution.

== Etymology ==
The native name has its etymology in the same land. The word "Tlaquepaque" means "Place on knolls of clay land," although there are other versions that are inclined to "men who craft clay pieces ("Tlacapan")". For others, the word "Tlaquepaque" comes from the word "Tlalipac", "on mud knolls". Yet another etymology says that it means "place of mud."

=== Recovery of the original name ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2021}}
As established in the initiative that the municipal president sent to the State Congress, in 1843 San Pedro Tlaquepaque was granted the category of Villa, a name he kept until 1917, when by decree of the then governor [[Manuel Aguirre Berlanga]], prohibited in Jalisco using the name of saints in streets, squares, parks, as well as "living people, animals or other frivolous designations". The ban did not include municipalities, but San Pedro Tlaquepaque lost the first part of its original name.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Currently, the municipality of Tlaquepaque recovered its full name San Pedro Tlaquepaque, an initiative carried out by the municipal president, Miguel Castro Reynoso. Before seeking recovery, the City Council of Tlaquepaque carried out a consultation between residents of the municipality, both the head and other delegations. The polls were available to citizens from 20 September to 8 October 2010 and 13,043 people participated. The result was that 62.4 percent of the people consulted are in favor of the municipality being renamed San Pedro Tlaquepaque; 37.2 percent to stay as is and 0.4 percent did not answer. The results of the consultation were the basis for the agreement that the plenary session of the City of Tlaquepaque took on 11 November 2010, through which the municipal president was authorized to present to the State Congress an initiative to request the name change, as well as the modification of article 4 of the Law of Government and Municipal Public Administration, which establishes the list of municipalities that make up Jalisco.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

On 21 June 2011, the Constitutional Points Commission of the State Congress approved the opinion through which the name change is authorized, so on 27 September 2011 the State Congress approved that the municipality of Tlaquepaque return to its original name, that is, San Pedro.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Tlaquepaque is also known for its famous [[tepache]], a partially [[fermented drink]] made with pineapple, brown sugar and water.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}
