'''Kano''' ([[Ajami script|Ajami]]: كَنُواْ) is a city in northern [[Nigeria]] and the capital of [[Kano State]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kano {{!}} state, Nigeria|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kano-state-Nigeria|access-date=2021-05-17|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> It is the [[List of Nigerian cities by population|second largest city in Nigeria]] after [[Lagos]], with over four million citizens living within {{cvt|449|km2}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nigeria: cities with the largest population 2022 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1121444/largest-cities-in-nigeria/ |access-date=2023-06-20 |website=Statista |language=en}}</ref> Located in the [[savanna]], south of the [[Sahel]], Kano is a major route of the [[trans-Saharan trade]], having been a trade and human settlement for millennia. It is the [[Traditional states of Nigeria|traditional state]] of the [[Ibrahim Dabo|Dabo dynasty]] who have ruled as emirs over the city-state since the 19th century. [[Kano Emirate Council]] is the current traditional institution inside the city boundaries of Kano, and under the [[Authority bias|authority]] of the [[Kano State Government|Government of Kano State]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kano {{!}} historical kingdom, Nigeria|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kano-historical-kingdom-Nigeria|access-date=2021-06-05|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

The city is one of the seven medieval [[Hausa kingdoms]]. The principal inhabitants of the city are the [[Hausa people | Hausa]] and [[Fula people | Fulani]] people. Centuries before British colonization, Kano was strongly cosmopolitan with settled populations of [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and remains so with the [[Hausa language]] spoken as a [[Lingua franca|lingua-franca]] by over 70 million speakers in the region.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Hausa Language |date=2022 |work=A History of the Hausa Language: Reconstruction and Pathways to the Present |pages=1–5 |editor-last=Newman |editor-first=Paul |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/history-of-the-hausa-language/hausa-language/429242C221AFBA1D927AF6DA2B677CD9 |access-date=2024-05-26 |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781009128070.002 |isbn=978-1-009-12310-5}}</ref>

[[Islam in Nigeria|Islam]] arrived in the city in the 11th century or earlier primarily through the [[trans-Saharan trade]]. As a result, Kano became wealthy and the commercial nerve centre of the region and [[Northern Nigeria]], and is still associated as the "[[List of Nigerian states' nicknames|centre of commerce]]".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tour Nigeria |date=2022-03-12 |title=Kano State, The Centre of commerce |url=https://m.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Ftournigeriang%2Fvideos%2Fkano-state-the-centre-of-commerce-did-you-know-kano-is-the-second-largest-indust%2F667175861158993%2F&refsrc=deprecated&_rdr |access-date=2024-05-26 |website=m.facebook.com |language=en}}</ref>

=== Middle Ages: spread of Islam and trade ===
{{see also|Sultanate of Kano|Muhammad Rumfa|Trans-Saharan trade}}In the 12th century, [[Ali Yaji]] from Kudawa lineage as King of Kano renounced his allegiance to the cult of Tsumburbura, converted to Islam and proclaimed the [[Sultanate of Kano|Sultanate]] that was to last until its fall in the 19th century. The reign of Yaji ensued an era of expansionism that saw Kano becoming the capital of a pseudo Habe Empire.
[[File:The Kano State Emirs Palace entrance.jpg|left|thumb|309x309px|[[Gidan Rumfa]] built in the 15th century by [[Muhammad Rumfa|Muhammadu Rumfa]]]]
In 1463, [[Muhammad Rumfa]] (reigned 1463–1499) ascended the throne. During his reign, political pressure from the rising [[Songhai Empire]] forced him to take Auwa, the daughter of [[Askia Mohammad I|Askiyah the Great]] as his wife. She was to later become the first female Madaki of Kano.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

Rumfa was a rich and flamboyant king. Luxurious clothing and expensive ostrich feather shoes were common among government officials. The [[kakaki]] (a kind of trumpet) was also first used during his reign. His wealth is owed to Kano's commercial prosperity during this period. Kano arguably achieved the height of its reputation as an important trading center of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in the Middle Ages during his reign. [[Leo Africanus]]'s description of Kano is believed to be that of Rumfas era. He described the locals as "wealthy merchants and skilled craftsmen" and commended the cavalry of the Sultan's army. He also noted the abundance of rice, corn, cotton and citrus fruits.<ref name="Fisher 1978 86–112">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Humphrey J.|date=1978|title=Leo Africanus and the Songhay Conquest of Hausaland|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=86–112|doi=10.2307/217055|issn=0361-7882|jstor=217055}}</ref>

=== Fulani rule ===
{{See also|Kano Emirate}}
At the beginning of the 19th century, [[Fula people|Fulani]] Islamic leader [[Usman dan Fodio]] led a [[jihad]] affecting much of central Sudan which demolished the Habe kingdom, leading to the emergence of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. In 1805 the last sultan of Kano was defeated by the Jobe Clan of the [[Fulani]], and Kano became an Emirate of the Caliphate. Kano was already the largest and most prosperous province of the empire.<ref name="lovejoy">{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first= Paul |page=195 |title= Transformations in Slavery: A History of Slavery in Africa |year=1983 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |place= Cambridge UK |isbn=0-521-24369-6}}</ref>

The city suffered famines from 1807 to 1810, in the 1830s, 1847, 1855, 1863, 1873, 1884, and from 1889 until 1890.<ref name=famine>{{cite web |url=http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/afoodsec.html |last=Milich|first=Lee |title= Food Security in Pre-Colonial Hausaland|access-date=2007-10-26 |publisher=[[University of Arizona|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]] |date=1997-07-17}}</ref>

During the 19th century when Kano came under the [[suzerainty]] of the Sokoto Caliphate, Kano prospered as the center of commercial activity. Weaving, dyeing and leatherwork were traded as far north as Morocco and thereafter to Europe. Its cotton cloth traded as far as [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]], [[Lake Chad]], and [[Timbuktu]].

In 1851, [[Heinrich Barth]] (a German scholar who spent several years in northern Nigeria in the 1850s) mentioned that Kano had a 10-mile long 30&nbsp;ft high clay walls with a population of 30,000 with commerce and manufacturing abundant. He mentioned "its huge market was a labyrinth of narrow alleys with everything sold from vegetables to slaves".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Meredith |first=Martin |url=http://archive.org/details/fortunesofafrica0000mere_b3d2 |title=The Fortunes of Africa: A 5000 Year History of Wealth, Greed and Endeavour |publisher=Public Affairs |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-61039-459-8 |location=New York |pages=167}}</ref> He also called Kano the greatest emporium of central Africa and estimated the percentage of slaves in Kano to be at least 50%, most of whom lived in slave villages.<ref name="lovejoy" /> This was one of the last major slave societies, with high percentages of enslaved population long after the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had been cut off.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

From 1893 until 1895, two rival claimants for the throne fought a civil war, or ''[[Basasa]]''. With the help of royal slaves, [[Yusufu]] was victorious over his brother [[Tukur]] and claimed the title of emir.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Stilwell |first= Sean |year= 2000 |title=Power, Honour and Shame: The Ideology of Royal Slavery in the Sokoto Caliphate |journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute |volume=70 |issue= 3|pages=394–421 |doi=10.2307/1161067|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |jstor=1161067}}</ref>

== Economy ==
The economic history of Kano dates back to the Middle Ages when the city served as the southernmost point of the famous [[Trans-Saharan trade|trans-Sahara trade]] routes. Kano was well connected with many cities in North Africa and some cities in southern Europe.<ref>[[Aliyu Salisu Barau|Barau, A.S]]. (2007) The Great Attractions of Kano.</ref> By 1851, the city of Kano produced 10 million pairs of sandals and 5 million tanned hides annually for export,<ref>{{cite book|author=M. G. Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUx0AAAAMAAJ&q=City+of+Kano+10+million+sandals|title=Government In Kano, 1350-1950|date=1997|publisher=[[Avalon Publishing]]|isbn=9780813332703|page=257|author-link=M. G. Smith}}</ref> with other products including textile materials, leather and grains. Kano was connected with [[trans-Atlantic trade]] in 1911 when a railway line reached Kano. Kano is a major centre for the production and export of agricultural products like [[hide (skin)|hide]]s, [[skin]]s, [[peanut]]s, and [[cotton]].

The city maintains its economy and business even in the 21st century, with it producing the richest man in Africa—[[Aliko Dangote]]—whose great-grandfather [[Alhassan Dantata]] was the richest West African in the mid 20th century. Over the years, inconsistent government policies and sporadic electricity supply hampered manufacturing and industry, so that Kano's economy relies primarily on trade, retail and services. There are plans to establish an [[information technology]] park in the city.<ref>{{cite news|date=2007-11-04|title=Nigerian city of Kano plans IT park|work=[[Panapress]]|publisher=Afriquenligne|url=http://www.afriquenligne.fr/news/daily-news/nigerian-city-of-kano-plans-it-park-2007110410666/|access-date=2007-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211095115/http://www.afriquenligne.fr/news/daily-news/nigerian-city-of-kano-plans-it-park-2007110410666/|archive-date=2008-02-11}}</ref>

== Culture ==

=== Equestrianism ===
[[File:September 2016 Durbar in Kano - Arrival of the Emir.jpg|thumb|Durbar Festival in Kano]]
Kano is traditionally an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] society and this is manifested during the annual [[Durbar festival]]<ref name="susafrica.com">{{Cite web|date=2016-07-07|title=Emir of Kano, Sanusi II rides through Kano during Durbar festival|url=https://susafrica.com/2022/05/04/kano-durbar-festival-a-colorful-celebration-with-visual-extravaganza/|access-date=2023-06-05|website=Vanguard News|language=en-US}}</ref> to mark and celebrate the two annual Muslim festivals [[Eid al-Fitr]] (to mark the end of the Holy Month of [[Ramadan]]) and [[Eid al-Adha]] (to mark [[the Hajj]] Holy Pilgrimage).

Once assembled near the palace, the horsemen separate into their respective groups, each under the banner of district head (hakimai) or a titled nobleman from the emir's court (masarauta), take it in turns to charge toward the emir, pulling up just feet in front of the seated dignitaries to offer their respect and allegiance. During the festival, the emir makes a beautiful appearance in different colors dressed and adorned with the attire of a king.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-07-07|title=Emir of Kano, Sanusi II rides through Kano during Durbar festival|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/07/emir-kano-sanusi-ii-rides-kano-durbar-festival/|access-date=2021-06-05|website=Vanguard News|language=en-US}}</ref>

For the first time in 200 years, the durban horse festival was cancelled in 2012 due to the bad health condition of the Emir of Kano.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2012-08-15|title=Nigeria: Kano cancels famous durbar horse festival|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-19274593|access-date=2021-06-05}}</ref> Some analysts suggested that the cancellation could also be attributed to the rising deadly Boko haram attacks in the northern part of Nigeria at that time.

=== Architecture ===
Kano's architecture over the years has seen wide variations, especially from the [[Vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]] to modern architecture. The city is a leading axis of [[Sudano-Sahelian architecture]], developing the local [[Hausa architecture|Tubali]] style which manifested in mosques, walls, common compounds, and gates.

The design exteriorization of building façades was and is still widely used in Kano architecture, with the city harboring several skilled artisans.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2019-09-01|title=The practice of Hausa traditional architecture: Towards conservation and restoration of spatial morphology and techniques|journal=Scientific African|language=en|volume=5|pages=e00142|doi=10.1016/j.sciaf.2019.e00142|issn=2468-2276|doi-access=free|last1=Umar|first1=Gali Kabir|last2=Yusuf|first2=Danjuma Abdu|last3=Ahmed|first3=Abubakar|last4=Usman|first4=Abdullahi M.|bibcode=2019SciAf...500142U }}</ref>

=== Fortifications ===
{{See also|Ancient Kano City Walls}}The [[Ancient Kano City Walls]] were built as a [[defensive wall]] with the construction of the foundation laid by Sarki Gijimasu (r. 1095–1134), the third king of the [[Kingdom of Kano]] in the [[Kano Chronicle]]. In the mid 14th century during the reign of Zamnagawa, the wall was completed before it was further expanded during the 16th century. According to historians, the then General-Governor of the Colony and Protectorate of [[Nigeria]], [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Fredrick Lugard]], wrote in a 1903 report about the Kano Walls that he had "never seen anything like it in Africa" after capturing the ancient city of Kano along with British forces.<ref>{{Cite web|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=Ancient Kano City Walls and Associated Sites |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5171/|access-date=2021-06-05|language=en}}</ref>

Larger palaces, include the [[Gidan Rumfa]], [[Gidan Makama Museum Kano|Gidan Makama]], and winter retreat for the emir.

Kano houses a railway station with trains to [[Lagos]] routed through [[Kaduna]], while [[Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport]] lies nearby.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-06|title=FG to open Kano, new MM International Airports for use in March|url=https://nairametrics.com/2021/03/06/fg-to-open-kano-new-mm-international-airports-for-use-in-march/|access-date=2021-06-05|website=Nairametrics|language=en-GB}}</ref> The city is supplied with water by the nearby [[Challawa Gorge Dam]], which is being considered as a source of hydro power.<ref>{{cite web|author=PROF.

The airline [[Kabo Air]] had its head office in the city.<ref>"[http://www.kaboair.com/contact.html Contact Us]." [[Kabo Air]]. Retrieved on 27 November 2010. "HEAD OFFICE 67/73 Ashton Rd P.O.Box 1850 Kano State Nigeria"</ref> Kano was also headquarters of [[Azmar Airlines|Azman Airlines]] and is the headquarters city of [[Max Air]] and various independent travel agencies.
After a hiatus of many years, the [[Rail transport in Nigeria|railway line]] from Kano to Lagos was rehabilitated by 2013. The train trip to Lagos takes 30 hours and costs the equivalent of [[US dollar|US$12]], only a quarter of the equivalent bus fare.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21571481-renovated-railway-line-welcome-more-are-still-sorely-needed-slow "Trains in Nigeria: A slow but steady new chug,"] ''[[The Economist]]''</ref>

In 2014, a new double track, [[standard gauge]] line is under construction from Lagos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2014/03/25/zte-communications-nigerias-railway/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609190950/http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2014/03/25/zte-communications-nigerias-railway/|title=ZTE COMMUNICATIONS FOR NIGERIA'S RAILWAY|archive-date=9 June 2014|work=Railways Africa}}</ref>

In 2017, a 74-km, four-line [[light rail]] network was announced by the Kano State Ministry of Works, Housing & Transport; with a US$1.8 billion contract signed with [[China Railway Construction Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/kano-light-rail-contract-signed.html|title=Kano light rail contract signed|website=Metro Report|date=17 February 2017|access-date=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/nigeria-to-build-a-light-rail-system-in-kano/|title=Nigeria to build a light rail system in Kano|website=Railway Pro|date=2 September 2016|access-date=22 July 2019}}</ref>

Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Kano:
* [[Algiers-Lagos Highway]]

* [[Dakar-Ndjamena Highway]]

From 2006 to 2015, backed by high oil prices, major highways, overhead bridges and other transportation infrastructure were built by the state government. The most notable of these are the Silver Jubilee flyover bridge at [[Kofar Nassarawa]], the Kofar Kabuga underpass and various 6-lane highways in the city. In 2020, the Vice president of Nigeria [[Yemi Osibanjo]] was in Kano to commission the [[Alhassan Dantata]] flyover along Murtala Muhammad Way and Tijjani Hashim underpass way, [[Kofar Ruwa]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-13|title=Osinbajo arrives Kano, commissions Dantata flyover|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/372362-osinbajo-arrives-kano-commissions-dantata-flyover.html|access-date=2021-06-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>
