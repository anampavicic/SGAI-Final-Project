'''Jabalpur''', formerly '''Jubbulpore''', is a city situated on the banks of [[Narmada River]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. It is the 3rd-largest urban agglomeration of the state and the 38th-largest of the country. Jabalpur is the administrative headquarters of the [[Jabalpur district]] and the [[Jabalpur division]]. It is the judicial capital of Madhya Pradesh with [[Madhya Pradesh High Court]] being located in the city. It is generally accepted that the game of [[snooker]] originated in Jabalpur.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.titansports.co.uk/history/snooker.htm |title=The History of Snooker |publisher=Titansports.co.uk |access-date=1 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021217110948/http://www.titansports.co.uk/history/snooker.htm |archive-date=17 December 2002 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Jabalpur is also the railway headquarters of the [[West Central Railway]]. [[Jabalpur Cantonment]] is one of the largest cantonments in India and houses the army headquarters of five states ([[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Orissa]], [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]]). The city is known for the [[Marble Rocks|marble rocks]] on the river Narmada at [[Bhedaghat]]. It is also known as 'Sanskardhani' meaning 'The Cultural Capital' highlighting the city's rich cultural and historical heritage. The city of Jabalpur was among the first 7 smart cities selected for the [[Smart Cities Mission]].

== Etymology ==
According to a prevalent theory, Jabalpur was named after a sage named Jabali, who meditated on the banks of the Narmada river. Another theory suggests an [[Arabic]] origin of the word since {{lang|ar-Latn|jabal}} ({{lang|ar|جبل}}) in Arabic means granite boulders or huge boulders, which were common in the region. According to a fringe theory, the name refers to ''Jauli Pattala'', a sub-divisional unit, mentioned in [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] inscriptions. Jauli also refers to the [[Huna people|Huna]] queen of the Kalachuri king, Karna. It was spelled as ''Jubbulpore'' during British rule<ref>{{cite news |last=Chibber |first=Nanditta |date=27 November 2018 |title=MP Trail: When two Britishers disagreed on the name of Jabalpur |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/heritage/mp-trail-when-two-britishers-disagreed-on-the-name-of-jabalpur/cid/1676744 |work=[[The Telegraph (India)|The Telegraph]] |access-date=9 December 2019 }}</ref>

== History ==
Mythology describes three [[Asura]]s (evil spirits) in the Jabalpur region, who were defeated by the Hindu god [[Shiva]]. [[Tripurasura]] being the main asura, gave the city its ''puranic'' name Tripur Tirth.<ref name="city">{{cite book |title=Jabalpur, City Guide |date=2008 |publisher=Goodearth Publications |isbn=978-81-87780-73-1 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HiOyJuxqZv4C&pg=PA8 |language=en}}</ref> [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Tripuri region]] corresponds to the ancient [[Chedi Kingdom]] of Mahabharata times, to which king [[Shishupala]] belongs.

[[Ashoka]]n relics dating to 300 BCE have been found in Rupnath, {{convert|84|km|mi}} north of the city, indicating the presence of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]] (322 to 185 BCE) in the region.<ref name="city" /> When the empire fell, Jabalpur became a [[city-state]] before coming under the rule of the [[Satavahana dynasty]] (230 BCE to 220 CE). After their reign, the region was ruled locally by the Bodhis and the Senas, following which it became a [[vassal state]] of the [[Gupta Empire]] (320 to 550).<ref name="city"/>

The region was conquered by the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri Dynasty]] in 875 CE. The best known Kalachuri ruler was Yuvaraja-Deva I ({{abbr|r.|reigned}}&nbsp;915–945), who married Nohla Devi (a princess of the [[Chalukya dynasty]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mirashi |first1=V.

=== Gondwana rule ===
[[File:Maharani Durgavati.jpg|thumb|Rani Durgavati preparing for the battle of Narrai; fresco by Beohar Rammanohar Sinha in Jabalpur's Shaheed-Smarak]]
Jabalpur was an important centre of power during the rule of the [[Gondi people|Gond]] kings of [[Garha-Mandla]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jabalpur.nic.in/en/history/|title=History &#124; District Administration Jabalpur, Government of Madhya Pradesh &#124; India}}</ref>
The ruler of [[Garha-Mandla]], Madan Shah, (1138–1157) built a watchtower and a small hilltop fort at [[Madan Mahal, Jabalpur|Madan Mahal]], an area in Jabalpur. In the 1500s, the Gond king, [[Sangram Shah]] held [[Singorgarh fort]]. [[Rani Durgawati]] was a princess of the [[Chandela dynasty#Descendants|Chandela Dynasty]] who was married to [[Dalpat Shah]] of the [[Garha-Mandla|Gond dynasty]]. She was well aware of the importance of water conservation, and hence she built more than 85 ponds in Jabalpur, mainly in Ranital, Haathital, Madhatal and Hanumantal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindujagruti.org/articles/84_rani-durgavati-gondwana.html|title=Gondwana rulers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007171922/https://www.hindujagruti.org/articles/84_rani-durgavati-gondwana.html|archive-date=7 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Gond king, [[Hridayshah|Hriday Shah]] (1634-1668), moved his court to the [[Ramnagar, Madhya Pradesh|Mandla]] fort. He secured water sources and built irrigation structures. The kingdom was invaded in 1742 by the [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha]] [[peshwa]] (prime minister), [[Balaji Baji Rao]] along with Visaji Chandorkar, the [[Marathas of Saugor|Maratha governor of Sagar]], and made a tributary state of the [[Maratha Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Indian Dissertation Abstracts |date=1988 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yu8agexm5TUC&q=govind+pant+bundele+sagar |language=en}}</ref><ref name="seoni">{{cite book |last1=Pradesh (India) |first1=Madhya |title=Madhya Pradesh: Seoni |date=1989 |publisher=Government Central Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyVuAAAAMAAJ&q=bakht+buland+shah |language=en}}</ref>

=== Maratha rule ===
The [[Marathas of Saugor|Maratha rulers of Sagar]] finally annexed the weakened [[Garha Kingdom]] in 1781.<ref>Chatterton, Eyre (originally published in 1917) ''The Story of Gondwana'', p.98</ref> Around 1798, the Maratha [[Peshwa]] gave the [[Narmada River|Nerbuddah valley]] to the [[Nagpur Kingdom|Bhonsle kings of Nagpur]], who ruled the area until 1818, when it was seized by the [[British East India Company]] after the [[Battle of Sitabuldi]].<ref Name = "imperial">Hunter, William Wilson, Sir, et al. (1908). ''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', Volume 17. 1908-1931; Clarendon Press, Oxford.</ref>

=== British rule ===
The British made Jabalpur the commission headquarters of the Narmada territories and established a cantonment here. Under the British Raj, Jabalpur became the capital of the [[Saugor and Nerbudda Territories]], which was part of the British North-Western Province. The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories became part of the new [[Central Provinces]] in 1861 which in 1903 became the Central Provinces and [[Berar Division|Berar]]. By the early 20th Century Jabalpur was the headquarters of a brigade in the 5th division of the Southern Army.

A significant event was the Tripuri Congress session in 1939, led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Under the guidance of [[Lokmanya Tilak]], the [[Flag Satyagraha]] was successfully launched. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Jabalpur four times. The Congress session in 1939, where Subhash Chandra Bose was elected president against Gandhi's wishes, was notable for its debates on strategies for India's independence. A memorial gate, Kamania Gate, was built in the city to commemorate these events.

After India's independence in 1947, the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] became the state of Madhya Pradesh.

Under British rule, and among others in the works of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], the city name was spelled ''Jubbulpore''.

The city's institutional buildings still showcase the [[British colonial architecture]].
