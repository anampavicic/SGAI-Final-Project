Patiala is located around the ''[[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]'' (the 'Blessed Castle') constructed by a chieftain [[Ala Singh]], who founded the royal dynasty of [[Patiala State]] in 1763, and after whom the city is named.

In popular culture, the city remains famous for its traditional ''[[Patiala Shahi Pagg|Patiala shahi]]'' [[turban]] (a type of headgear), ''[[Punjabi Paranda|paranda]]'' (a tasselled tag for braiding hair), ''Patiala salwar'' (a type of female trousers), ''[[jutti]]'' (a type of footwear) and [[Patiala peg]] (a measure of liquor).

==History==
{{Main|Patiala State}}
[[File:Painting of Ala Singh of Patiala in tondo, Pahari School, ca.1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ala Singh]], the founder of Patiala]]
Patiala city was established in 1763 by [[Ala Singh]], a [[Jat Sikh]] chieftain, who laid the foundation of the Patiala fort known as [[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]], around 'which the present city of Patiala is built. After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 in which the [[Maratha Confederacy|Marathas]] was defeated by the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout [[Punjab]]. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. The Patiala state saw more than forty years of a ceaseless power struggle with the [[Pashtun|Afghan]] [[Durrani Empire]], [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] of [[Lahore]].

In 1808, the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the [[British Raj|British]] against [[Sikh]] ruler [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] of Lahore in 1808, thus becoming collaborator in the grand empire-building process by the British in the sub-continent of India. Patiala became a [[17-gun salute]] state during the [[British Raj]]. The rulers of Patiala such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]], [[Rajinder Singh of Patiala|Rajinder Singh]], [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]], and [[Yadavindra Singh|Yadvindra Singh]] were treated with respect and dignity by the British.

The city of Patiala was designed and developed according to a plan akin to that of [[Hindu temple architecture|temple architecture]], the first settlers of Patiala were the [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] of [[Sirhind]], who opened their business establishments outside the Darshani Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patiala.gov.in/html/history.htm|title=History Of Patiala|access-date=24 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024084323/http://patiala.gov.in/html/history.htm|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Shri Kali Devi Patiala.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Murti]]'' of Maa kali at the [[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala]]. The temple was commissioned by the Sikh ruler of Patiala, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] in 1936.]]
[[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala|Kali Devi Temple]] is a [[Hindu temple]] dedicated to [[Maa Kaali]]. The temple was built by the Sikh ruler of the Patiala State, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]], who financed the building of the temple in his capital and oversaw its installation in 1936. Legend has it that the Maharaja built the temple to protect the city from flooding and performed annual sacrifice at the temple. Bhupinder Singh ruled the princely state of Patiala from 1900 to 1938. He brought the 6-ft statue of Divine Mother Kali and Paawan Jyoti from Bengal to Patiala and offered the first [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Bali]] (sacrifice) of a water buffalo to the temple. Because of the temple's beautiful structure, it has been declared a national monument. This large complex attracts devotees, [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]], from distant places.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

A much older temple of Raj Rajeshwari is also situated in the center of this complex. The temple is situated opposite the Baradari garden at Mall Road. Devotees offer mustard oil, daal (lentils), sweets, coconuts, bangles, and chunnis, goats, hens, and [[liquor]] to the Divine Mother here. As an average estimate, devotees offer more than 60,000 liquor bottles during Navratras alone, which are distributed to the beggars sitting outside the temple and go into a 'Sharab Kund' built on the temple's premises.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/donate-online/religious-offering-inner/1323430251 | title=Donate your Offerings to Religious Institutes Online with HDFC Bank }}</ref>

The [[Sikh gurus|Guru]] visited Lehal on Magh sudi 5, 1728 Bikram/24 January 1672 and stayed under a [[Banyan|banyan tree]] by the side of a pond. The sickness in the village subsided. The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as [[Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib|Dukh Nivaran]], literally meaning eradicator of suffering. Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the Sarovar attached to the shrine. It is still believed that any illness can be cured by 'ishnaan' on five consecutive [[Panchami]].

=== Qila Mubarak complex ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
[[File: Qila Mubarak, Patiala.jpg|thumb|A gate of the Qila Mubarak in Patiala, built in the 18th century]]
[[File:PATIALA,QILLA MUBARAK.jpg|thumb|The Darshani Gate (the main gate of the [[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]), built in the 18th century. The city was built around the fort.]]
The Qila Mubarak complex stands on a 10-acre ground in the heart of the city and contains the main palace or Qila Androon (literally, 'inner fort'), the [[Guest house|guesthouse]] or Ran Baas and the Darbar Hall. Outside the Qila are the Darshani Gate, a Shiva temple, and bazaar shops which border the streets that run around the Qila and sell precious ornaments, colourful hand-woven fabrics, '[[jooti]]s' and bright 'Paradis'.

It was the principal residence of the Patiala royals until the construction of Old Moti Bagh Palace.

The entrance is through an imposing gate. The architectural style of the palace is a synthesis of late Mughal and Rajasthani. The complex has ten courtyards along the north–south axis. Each courtyard is unique in size and character, some being broad, others very small and others mere slits in the fabric of the building. Though the Androon is a single interconnected building, it is spoken of as a series of palaces. Each set of rooms makes a cluster around a courtyard, and each carries a name: Topkhana, Qila Mubarak, Sheesh Mahal, Treasury, and Prison. Ten of the rooms are painted with frescoes or decorated intricately with mirrors and gilt.

In a tiny portion of the complex is a little British construction with Gothic arches, fireplaces made of marble, and built-in toilets perched on the Mughal Rajasthani roof. Burj Baba Ala Singh has had a fire smouldering ever since the time of Ala Singh, along with a flame brought by him from Jwalaji. Every year it's decorated beautifully for the Heritage Festival.

==Culture and traditions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2021}}
[[File:Patiala Phulkari.jpg|thumb|[[Phulkari]] from Patiala]]

Patiala's sway over the Malwa area extended beyond merely political influence. Patiala was equally the set of religious and cultural life. Educationally, Patiala was at the forefront. Patiala was the first town in this part of the country to have a degree college – the [[Mohindra College]] – in 1870.

Patiala has seen the evolution of a distinct style of architecture. Borrowing from the [[Rajput]] style, its beauty and elegance are molded according to the local traditions.

[[File: Phul Cinema.jpg|thumb|Phul Cinema on the Mall facing the Fountain Chowk is built in [[Art Deco]] style]]

With the active patronage of the Maharajas of Patiala, a well-established style of [[Hindustan]] I music called the "[[Patiala gharana]]" came into existence and has held its own up to the present times. This school of music has had several famous musicians, many of whom came to Patiala after the disintegration of the [[Mughal Court]] at [[Delhi]] in the 18th century. At the turn of the century, Ustad Ali Bux was the most renowned exponent of this Gharana. Later, his sons Ustad [[Akhtar Hussain Khan]] and [[Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]] achieved worldwide fame and brought glory to the Patiala Gharana.

After the partition of British India, the Muslim community was massacred or forced to flee the city en masse to [[Pakistan]]. At the same time, many [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] refugees migrated from Pakistan and settled on the Muslim properties in Patiala. The then Maharaja of Patiala, [[Yadavindra Singh|His Highness Yadavindra Singh]], [[Rajpramukh]] of [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union|PEPSU]] with his wife [[Rajmata Mohinder Kaur of Patiala|Her Highness Maharani Mohinder Kaur]] organized a large number of camps and worked tirelessly for the people.
