'''Cochabamba''' ({{langx|ay|Quchapampa}}; {{langx|qu|Quchapampa}}) is a city and municipality in central [[Bolivia]] in a valley in the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]]. It is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Cochabamba Department]] and the [[list of cities in Bolivia|fourth largest city in Bolivia]], with a population of 630,587 according to the [[2012 Bolivian census]].<ref name=2012census/> Its name is from a compound of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] words ''qucha'' "lake" and ''[[pampa]]'', "open [[plain]]."<ref>[http://futatraw.ourproject.org/descargas/DicQuechuaBolivia.pdf Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha] pdf{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> Residents of the city and the surrounding areas are commonly referred to as ''cochalas'' or, more formally, ''cochabambinos''.

It is known as the "City of Eternal Spring" or "The Garden City" because of its spring-like temperatures all year round.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pisarro|first=Marcelo|title=Veredas cochabambinas|url=https://cienciaspardas.substack.com/p/6-veredas-cochabambinas|access-date=2021-03-17|website=cienciaspardas.substack.com|date=14 January 2021 }}</ref> It is also known as "La Llajta," which means "town" in Quechua. It is the largest urban center between the higher capital of [[La Paz]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] in the tropical plains of the east. It sits south-west of the Tunari mountains, and north of the foothills of the Valle Alto. In antiquity, the area featured numerous lakes, which gave the city its name. Many of these lakes have since disappeared to urban development, but Coña Coña and Alalay lakes are extant examples. It has been a populated settlement since the Pre-Inca period, and is today an important cultural, educational, political, and commercial centre.

==History==

===Pre-Inca and Inca===
The valley of Cochabamba has been inhabited for thousands of years due to its fertile productive [[soil]]s and mild [[climate]]. [[Archeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that the initial inhabitants were of indigenous ethnic groups: [[Tiwanaku]], Tupuraya, Mojocoya, [[Omereque]], and [[Inca]] inhabited the valley at times before the Spanish arrived.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The area got its name from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] Kochaj-pampa, as part of the [[Inca]] [[civilization]]. The area was conquered by [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] (ruled 1471–1493). His son [[Huayna Capac]] turned Cochabamba into a large production enclave or state farm to serve the Incas. The local population was possibly depleted during the Inca conquest and Huayna Capac imported 14,000 people, called [[mitima]]s, to work the land. The principal crop was [[maize]] which could not be grown in much of the high and cold heartland of the Inca Empire. The maize was stored in 2,400 storehouses ([[qollqa]]s) in the hills overlooking the valley or transported by [[llama]] caravan to storage sites in [[Paria, Bolivia|Paria]], [[Cusco]], of other Inca administrative centres.  Most of the maize was probably used to sustain the Inca army during its campaigns.<ref>D'Altroy, Terence N. (2003), ''The Incas'', Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, pp 268-173; La Lone, Mary B. and La Lone, Darrell E. (1987), "The Inca State in the Southern Highlands: State Administrative and Production Enclaves," ''Ethnohistory'', pp. 50-51</ref>

===Spanish and Bolivian===
The first Spanish inhabitant of the valley was Garci Ruiz de Orellana in 1542. He purchased the majority of the land from local tribal chiefs Achata and Consavana through a title registered in 1552 at the Imperial City of [[Potosí]]. The price paid was 130 pesos. His residence, known as the House of Mayorazgo, still stands in the Cala Cala neighbourhood.

The city, called Villa de Oropesa, was founded on 2 August 1571 by order of [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa]]. It was to be an agricultural production centre to provide food and wood<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/the-southwest/cochabamba/history|title=History of Cochabamba - Lonely Planet Travel Information|last=Planet|first=Lonely|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> for the mining towns of the relatively nearby [[Altiplano]] region, particularly [[Potosí]] which became one of the largest and richest cities in the world during the 16th and 17th centuries &mdash; funding the vast wealth that ultimately made Spain a world power. In fact, anthropologist Jack Weatherford and others have cited the city of Potosí as the birth of capitalism because of the money and materialism it provided Spain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/americas/for-miners-increasing-risk-on-a-mountain-at-the-heart-of-bolivias-identity.html|title=For Miners, Increasing Risk on a Mountain at the Heart of Bolivia's Identity|work=The New York Times |date=17 September 2014 |access-date=2018-11-29|language=en |last1=Neuman |first1=William }}</ref> Thus, with the [[silver mining]] industry in Potosí at its height, Cochabamba thrived during its first centuries. However, the city entered a period of decline during the 18th century as mining began to wane.

In 1786, King [[Charles III of Spain]] renamed the city the 'loyal and valiant' Villa of Cochabamba. This was done to commend the city's pivotal role in suppressing the indigenous rebellions of 1781 in [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] by sending armed forces to Oruro to quell the uprisings. Since the late 19th century it has again been generally successful as an agricultural centre for Bolivia.

The 1793 census shows that the city had a population of 22,305 persons. There were 12,980 [[mestizos]], 6,368 Spaniards, 1,182 indigenous natives, 1,600 [[mulattos]] and 175 African [[slave]]s.

In 1812, Cochabamba was the site of a riot against the Spanish Army. On May 27, thousands of women took up arms against the Spanish. According to historian Nathaniel Aguirre: "From Cochabamba, many men have fled. Not one woman. On the hillside, a great clamour. Cochabamba's plebeian women, at bay, fight from the centre of a circle of fire. Surrounded by five thousand Spaniards, they resist with battered tin guns and a few arquebuses; and they fight to the last yell, whose echoes will resound throughout the long war for independence. Whenever his army weakens, General Manuel Belgrano will shout those words which never fail to restore courage and spark anger. The general will ask his vacillating soldiers: '''Are the women of Cochabamba present?''"<ref>Juan de la Rosa by Nathaniel Aguirre</ref>

To celebrate their bravery, Bolivia now marks May 27 as Mother's Day.<ref>Memory of Fire Vol 2: Faces and Masks by Eduardo Galeano p.106</ref>

In 1900, the population was 21,886.

Besides a number of schools and charitable institutions, the Catholic diocese has 55 parishes, 80 churches and chapels, and 160 priests.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 1998, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to give Bolivia a loan of $138 million to control inflation and promote economic growth. However, it only agreed to do so on the condition that Bolivia sell "all remaining public enterprises," including its national oil refineries and the local water company, SEMAPA.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/timeline.html|title=FRONTLINE/WORLD .

The march was meant to be peaceful, but after two days the police used tear gas against the protestors and injured about 175 people and killed 1 and blinded two. Soon after, news reports were made about the protests and the violence.<ref name=":0" /> The Defense of Water and Life held an unofficial referendum and 96% of 50,000 people wanted Aguas del Tunari's contract to terminate, but the government refused. The protests only grew and the entire world began to watch forcing Bechtel to leave its contract and return SEMAPA to the public. Bechtel as well tried to sue the Bolivian government for $50 million but it withdrew its claim shortly after.<ref name=":1" /> This event was soon labelled as the Water Wars and became a driving force for anti-globalization projects such as the UN's decision to make water sanitation a human right and the privatisation of water as unethical in 2010. Additionally, the Water Wars would help spark the next revolt against the privatisation of natural gases from 2003 to 2005 which would lead to the removal of two presidents, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and Carlos Mesa, and the rise of President Evo Morales in 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/business/who-will-bring-water-to-the-bolivian-poor.html|title=Who Will Bring Water to the Bolivian Poor?|last=Forero|first=Juan|work=The New York Times |date=15 December 2005 |access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}</ref>

In January 2007, city dwellers clashed with mostly rural protestors, leaving four dead and over 130 injured. The first democratically elected Prefect of Cochabamba, [[Manfred Reyes Villa]], had allied himself with the leaders of Bolivia's Eastern Departments in a dispute with President [[Evo Morales]] over regional autonomy and other political issues. The protestors blockaded the [[highway]]s, bridges, and main roads, having days earlier set fire to the departmental seat of government, trying to force the resignation of Reyes Villa. Citizens attacked the protestors, breaking the blockade and routing them, while the police did little to stop the violence. Further attempts by the protestors to reinstate the blockade and threaten the government were unsuccessful, but the underlying tensions had not been resolved.

In July 2007, a monument erected by veterans of January's protest movement in honour of those killed and injured by government supporters was destroyed in the middle of the night, reigniting racial conflicts in the city.

In August 2008, a nationwide referendum was held. The prefect of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa, was not confirmed by the voters, and he was removed from the position.

==Climate==
Cochabamba is known for its "Eternal Spring". Neither experiencing the humid heat of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] nor the frigid winds of [[La Paz]], Cochabamba experiences a [[cold semi-arid climate|semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''BSk''), bordering on a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''Cwb''). The characteristic of the climate is an extended dry season that runs from May until October with a wet season that generally begins in November with the principal rains ending in March.

Commensurate with other large cities in the Andean highlands of South America, Cochabamba is a city of contrasts. Its central commercial districts, Zona Norte, is bounded by [https://web.archive.org/web/20080621061547/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktmuni=7&aktanzeige=lugar&aktlugar=2 Plaza Colón] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080115102335/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktmuni=7&aktanzeige=lugar&aktlugar=1 Plaza 14 de Septiembre], are generally equipped with modern urban amenities and are where the majority of the city's formal business and commercial industries are based. La Cancha, the largest open-air market in South America, is also an active place where locals can buy a range of items.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amizade.org/la-cancha-an-exuberant-marketplace-experience-in-bolivia/|title=La Cancha: An Exuberant Marketplace Experience in Bolivia on Amizade|last=Moore|first=Dillon|website=Amizade|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> An active nightlife is centered around [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106214155/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktanzeige=calle&aktcalle=3 Calle España] and along the broad, tree-lined boulevard, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107015853/http://www.cbba.info/karte/mymapa.php?aktanzeige=calle&aktcalle=28 El Prado]. In contrast, the Zona Sur, a remote area adjacent to the Wilstermann International [[Airport]] is visibly impoverished, with adobe homes and unpaved roads, which is often the first impression visitors acquire while commuting into the city.

In 2009, the government under President Evo Morales created a new constitution that declared Spanish and 36 other indigenous languages as the official languages of the country.<ref name=":2">{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bolivia/Languages-and-religion|title=Bolivia - Languages and religion|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}</ref> However, the most widely spoken languages in Cochabamba are Spanish and Quechua. Although the Spanish that is spoken in the Cochabamba region is generally regarded as rather conservative in its phonetics and vocabulary, the use of Quechua terminology (''wawa'' [child] and ''wistupiku'' [mouth or twist lips]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wistupiku.com/nuestra-familia/|title=Wistupiku – Nuestra familia|website=www.wistupiku.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>) has been widely incorporated into its standardized form.

As with most cities around the globe, English is increasingly spoken and understood, particularly among business-minded indigenous and repatriated Cochabambinos. English-language instruction has become incorporated into some private schools and universities but is not taught universally, therefore a vast majority of the population does not speak English.

About four-fifths of the population of Bolivia identifies as Catholic.<ref name=":2" />

Like other cities that share the same ethnic group quadrants like [[Salta]] or [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], Cochabamba's demographics consist of the following visible groups in order of prevalence: Indigenous (mostly of [[Quechua people|Quechua]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] ethnicity) people, [[Mestizo]], or mixed Indigenous and Spanish European, and people of Spanish ([[Criollo (people)|Criollos]]) and other European descent. As well as a fairly significant population of [[Afro-Bolivians]].

By 2013, the human development index of the Metropolitan region of Cochabamba was 0.801 as a result of a 35% growth in the last 20 years.<ref>https://www.undp.org/content/dam/bolivia/docs/undp_bo_IDH2016.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621185213/https://www.undp.org/content/dam/bolivia/docs/undp_bo_IDH2016.pdf |date=2019-06-21 }} {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

The area where Cochabamba is situated is commonly referred to as the granary of [[Bolivia]]. Its climate is milder than that of the Altiplano region to the west and thus permits extensive agriculture, including grains, potatoes, and coffee in the highlands and sugar cane, [[cocoa bean]]s, tobacco, and fruit in the Chapare tropical lowlands of the South American Amazon region, an area that had been one of the country's main [[coca]]-leaf-producing regions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Cochabamba is also the industrial hub of Bolivia, producing cars, cleaning products, cosmetics, chemicals, and cement. The economy of Cochabamba is characterized by producing goods and services. Recently, the software industry is becoming increasingly important. International companies like GOJA and Assuresoft also have subsidiaries in Cochabamba. Due to this industry growth, Cochabamba is called the "Silicon Valley of Bolivia", with a high demand for professionals immersed in technological careers such as Systems Engineering, Telecommunications and Information Technology.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==Education==
[[File:Univalle Campus Tiquipaya.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Universidad del Valle]]
The city is the home of the [[University of San Simón]] (UMSS, for "Universidad Mayor de San Simón"), one of the largest and most prominent public universities in Bolivia. UMSS is the second best university in Bolivia according to QS World University Rankings in 2013 but measured by the web metric scores as the first one during 2013–2017. Among the private universities in Bolivia ranking in the top ten are the Universidad Privada Boliviana (a prestigious business university), Universidad del Valle (a strong university in medicine with a large enrollment of international students) and  Universidad Católica Boliviana "San Pablo". Other universities include Escuela Militar de Ingenieria "Antonio Jose de Sucre", Universidad Simón I. Patiño, Universidad de Aquino Bolivia, Universidad Adventista de Bolivia, Universidad Privada Domingo Savio and Universidad Privada Abierta Latinoamericana (UPAL). Cochabamba became the second recipient city of Brazilian students in Bolivia after the city of Santa Cruz, due to the affordable and good living conditions of the city. Also, Cochabamba is the home of one of the best schools of Bolivia, [[Colegio San Agustín (Cochabamba)|Colegio San Agustín]].

==Airport==
Cochabamba is served by the modern [[Jorge Wilstermann International Airport]] ([[IATA]] code CBB), which handles domestic and international flights.

Other domestic airlines that serve the airport include [[Línea Aérea Amaszonas]], Ecojet and [[TAM – Transporte Aéreo Militar|Transporte Aéreo Militar]].

==Neighborhoods==
Cochabamba is a steadily emerging market within the Bolivian [[real estate]] industry. Since 2010, it became the city with the most surface area in construction in Bolivia overpassing Santa Cruz and La Paz.  There are many middle and large buildings under construction by 2012. An annual mild climate, abundant greenery, mountain vistas, and a progressive local economy are factors that have contributed to the city's appeal to Bolivian nationals, expatriates and foreigners alike. Historic and affluent neighbourhoods such as Cala Cala, El Mirador, and Lomas de Aranjuez showcase some of the city's most distinguished residences.
