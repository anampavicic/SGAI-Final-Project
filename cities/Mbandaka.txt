'''Mbandaka''' ({{IPA-all|mbaˈnda.ka|pron}}, formerly known as '''Coquilhatville''' in [[French language|French]], or '''Coquilhatstad''' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a [[Cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|city]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] located near the confluence of the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Ruki River|Ruki]] rivers. It is the capital of [[Province of Équateur|Équateur Province]].

The city was founded in 1883 by British explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] under the name Équateurville.

The headquarters of the Fourth Naval Region of the [[Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] are located in the city.

== Geography ==
Mbandaka lies on the east bank of the [[Congo River]] below the mouth of the [[Ruki River]], a tributary of the Congo. South of the [[Ngiri Reserve]], a large area of swamp forest on the opposite bank of the Congo, it is located at the center of the [[Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe]] Ramsar wetland.<ref>{{cite web

==Description==
Mbandaka is the capital of Équateur province, and located only a few kilometers from the equator. It is home to [[Mbandaka airport]] and is linked by a four to seven day trip by river [[barge]] journey to [[Kinshasa]] and [[Boende]]. Kinshasa is an hour's plane ride away. 

Mbandaka is largely populated by people of the [[Mongo people|Mongo]] ethnic group, although people from many different tribes and regions live in the city. The main languages spoken in Mbandaka are [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[French language|French]], and [[Mongo language|Mongo]].

Years of war and neglect have caused deterioration of the city infrastructure; large areas of the city are without electricity or running water. Most of the streets and avenues of the city are unpaved dirt roads.

==History==
[[File:Mbandaka koloniale architectuur Banque du Congo belge.JPG|thumb|Bank of the Belgian Congo building]]
Mbandaka was founded in 1883 by British explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]], who named it ''"Équateurville".'' (At the time the territory was under the personal rule of King Leopold II, king of the Belgians and the official language was French.)

The town hall is about {{convert|4|km|mi|1|abbr=in}} north of the [[equator]]. Mbandaka is one of the closest to the equator of any substantial city in the world. Stanley placed a large "Equator Stone" near the riverbank south of the city to mark the point where he believed the equator crossed the river. It remains there today. Due to its symbolic location close to the equator and the Congo River, there were early plans to locate the capital of the [[Congo Free State]] in Coquilhatville, as the city was then called, but they never came off the drawing board. These plans included [[infrastructure]] for an estimated population of 100,000 people, a train station, a Catholic cathedral, a governor's residence, and a palace for future visits of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of the Belgians]].<ref>''Le Congo: de la colonisation belge à l'indépendance'', Auguste Maurel, page 94-95</ref>

In 1886, at the beginning of colonial rule, the Belgians changed the city's name to "Coquilhatville" naming it after [[Camille-Aimé Coquilhat]].

In 1938, work began on a bridge over the Congo River connecting Coquilhatville with the [[French Congo]] (now the [[Republic of Congo]]). Work was abandoned on the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], and only the foundations of the bridge pillars remain. In the 1930s, the Government of the [[Belgian Congo]] began several projects, including factories and a new city hall. 

The city hall was completed in 1947, just after the end of the Second World War. At that time, with a height of {{convert|39|m|ft|abbr=in}}, it was the tallest building in the Belgian Congo. A statue of Leopold II was installed on its roof. The city hall was destroyed by a fire in 1963.<ref>''Le Congo : de la colonisation belge à l'indépendance,'' Auguste Maurel, pp. 153-155</ref>

After the Belgian Congo gained its independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]], the new government changed the name of this city in 1966 to ''"Mbandaka"'' to honour a prominent local leader.

===Massacre of Hutus===
Near the end of the [[First Congo War]] in the late 20th century, hundreds of people (mainly [[Hutu]] refugees, women, and children) were massacred here on May 13, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bombshell UN report leaked: 'Crimes of genocide' against Hutus in Congo |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=August 26, 2010 | author=Jason Stearn |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/amphtml/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2010/0826/Bombshell-UN-report-leaked-Crimes-of-genocide-against-Hutus-in-Congo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Congolese soldiers said the order came from Col. Wilson, head of a brigade of [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila|Kabila]]'s troops, and Col. Richard, the brigade's operations chief, both [[Rwanda|Rwandan]]s. Gen. Gaston Muyango (Congolese) held the title of military commander but had no real power, they said.<ref>{{cite web|title=MASSACRES WERE A WEAPON IN CONGO'S CIVIL WAR |author=John Pomfret |work=Washington Post |date=June 11, 1997  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/06/11/massacres-were-a-weapon-in-congos-civil-war/d108200d-90f7-4ee9-8331-e0be34b9ea79/}}</ref>

==Main sights==

===Catholic Mission station and Central African history research centre of Bamanya===
[[File:Missie kerk a.JPG|thumb|Church of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC) at Bamanya, 2008.]]
A large research centre for Central African history, originally set up by Fathers [[Gustaaf Hulstaert]] and Honoré Vinck, is at the Catholic mission station of Bamanya (Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC)), {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=in}} east of Mbandaka.<ref>See: www.aequatoria.be</ref>

{{anchor|Eala Botanical Garden}}
===Eala Botanical Garden===
One of the finest botanical gardens of central Africa is at nearby Eala, about {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=in}} east of the town centre. The [[Eala Botanical Garden]], founded in 1900, contains between 4,000 and 5,000 species. It covers approximately {{convert|370|ha|acre|lk=in}} with special collections ({{convert|125|ha|acre|abbr=in|disp=or}}), forest ({{convert|190|ha|acre|abbr=in|disp=or}}), marsh ({{convert|50|ha|acre|abbr=in|disp=or}}) and savanna "Euobe" ({{convert|7|ha|acre|abbr=in|disp=or}}). Because of warfare and social disruption, the garden has been neglected. It is unfenced and subject to [[illegal logging]]. The last catalogue of its holdings was published in 1924.

===First Habitat for Humanity International housing project===
Mbandaka is the home of the world's first project of [[Habitat for Humanity]] International.  Founder [[Millard Fuller]] served as missionary with the [[Disciples of Christ]] Church in Mbandaka from 1973 to 1976.  The housing project Fuller started in Mbandaka in 1973 became known as the first project of Habitat for Humanity when Fuller founded Habitat upon his return to the United States.
