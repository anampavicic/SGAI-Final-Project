==Geography==
The Chuvash Republic is located in the center of [[European Russia]], in the heart of the [[Volga-Vyatka economic region]], mostly to the west of the [[Volga River]], in the [[Volga Upland]]. It borders with the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] in the west, [[Mari El Republic]] in the north, the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] in the east and southeast, [[Republic of Mordovia]] in the southwest, and the [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]] in the south. There are over two thousand rivers in the republic—with the major ones being the Volga, the [[Sura River|Sura]], and the [[Tsivil River|Tsivil]]—as well as four hundred lakes. Some of the Volga River valley reservoirs are in the north of the republic, and the Sura River flows towards the Volga along much of the republic's western boundary. 

The climate is moderately [[continental climate|continental]], with the average temperatures ranging from {{convert|-13|C}} in January to {{convert|+19|C}} in July. Annual [[precipitation]] varies between {{convert|450|and|700|mm|sp=us}}, but is uneven from one year to another. Natural resources include [[gypsum]], sand, [[clay]], [[sapropel]] deposits, [[phosphorite]], and [[peat]]. There are [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] deposits, although their extraction has not yet been commercially pursued. Forests, mostly in the south along the Sura River, cover approximately 30% of the land.<ref name="USPC">{{cite web|title=Economic Overview of the Republic of Chuvashia |publisher=United States Peace Corps Business Development Volunteers in Chuvashia |author=Steven Brown and Olin Lagon |url=http://www.bisnis.doc.gov/bisnis/bisdoc/0106Chuvashia.htm |date=June 2001 |access-date=August 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050704084704/http://www.bisnis.doc.gov/bisnis/bisdoc/0106Chuvashia.htm |archive-date=July 4, 2005 }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main article|History of Chuvashia}}
[[File:Map chuvashia.png|thumb|A map of the Chuvash Republic]]

The ancestors of the Chuvash were [[Bulgars]] and [[Sabir people|Suars]], [[Onogurs|Oghur]] Turkic tribes residing in the Northern [[Caucasus]] in the 5th to 8th centuries. In the 7th and 8th centuries, a part of the Bulgars left for the [[Balkans]], where, together with local [[South Slavs]], they established the state of modern [[Bulgaria]]. Another part moved to the Middle Volga Region (see [[Volga Bulgaria]]), where the Bulgar population that did not adopt [[Islam]] formed  the foundation of the Chuvash people.<ref name="USPC" />

During the [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria]], the steppe-dwelling Suar migrated north, where [[Volga Finns|Volga Finnic]] tribes, such as the [[Mordvins]] and [[Mari people|Mari]] lived. The Chuvash claim to be the descendants of these Suars who assimilated with the Mari. In 1242, they became vassals of the [[Golden Horde]]. Later [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] and [[Tatar]] rulers did not intervene in local internal affairs as long as tribute was paid annually to [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]]. When the power of the Golden Horde began to diminish, local [[Volga Tatars#Mishar Tatars|Mişär Tatar]] Murzas from [[Pyana River|Piana]] and [[Temnikov]] tried to govern the Chuvash area.

During [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s  war of conquest against the [[Khanate of Kazan]], in August 1552, the Chuvash Orsai and Mari [[Akpar Tokari]] princes swore their loyalty to the [[Grand Duchy of Muscovy]] at [[Alatyr, Chuvash Republic|Alatyr]] on the [[Sura River]]. Between 1650 and 1850, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] sent [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]-speaking missionaries to try to convert the Chuvash to the Orthodox faith. A group of these missionaries created a written Chuvash language. Most of the Chuvash who stayed in the area became Orthodox Christians, but some remained [[pagan]].

On 15 May 1917, the Chuvash joined the [[Idel-Ural]] Movement and in December 1917 joined the short-lived [[Idel-Ural State]], when an agreement was reached with [[Tatarstan|Tatar]] representatives to draw the eastern border of Chuvashia at the [[Sviyaga River]]. Between 1918 and 1919, the [[Russian Civil War]] encompassed the area. This ended with victory for the [[Bolsheviks]]. To gain support from the local population, Lenin ordered the creation of a Chuvash state within the [[Russian SFSR]]. On 24 June 1920, the [[Chuvash Autonomous Oblast]] was formed, which was transformed into the [[Chuvash ASSR]] in April 1925.

==Politics==
[[File:Cheboksary Government House.jpg|thumb|Seat of the Government of the Chuvash Republic]]
[[File:New Cheboksary Government House.jpg|thumb|Residence of the President of Chuvash Republic]]

Until 2012, the Chuvash Republic officially had the status of a state.  In the constitution of Chuvashia (version 6, dated 13 September 2011 No. 46), the following was fixed: "The Chuvash Republic is a republic (state) within the Russian Federation."

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the [[Republics of Russia|republic]] was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Chuvashia CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the Republic Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Republic administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Republic of Chuvashia is the fundamental law of the region. The [[State Council of the Chuvash Republic]] is the republic's [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The highest executive body is the Republic's Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters.

==Demographics==
Despite not being large, the republic is one of the most densely populated regions in the Russian Federation.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Its population was{{ru-census|p2010=1,251,619|p2002=1,313,754|p1989=1,336,066}}

The capital and largest city of Chuvashia is [[Cheboksary]], with a population of around 464,000 as of 2010. Cheboksary is situated mostly on the southern bank of the Volga in the northern part of the republic (one northern bank district was added in the second part of the 20th century), approximately {{convert|650|km|sp=us}} east of [[Moscow]]. Nearby to the east is the next largest city, [[Novocheboksarsk]], with a population of 124,000 as of 2010.

===Education===
There are five higher educational institutions, including the [[Chuvash State University]], the [[Chuvash State Pedagogical University]], and the [[Chuvash State Agrarian University]] located in Cheboksary.

==Economy==
{{Main article|Economy of Chuvashia}}
[[File:Spirtzavod.jpg|thumb|In a liquor distillery, [[Mariinsky Posad]]]]

The Chuvash Republic is the most populous and fertile area in the middle [[Volga region]]. There are deciduous woodlands on fertile black earth. In agriculture, wheat and sugar-beet, pigs and beef cattle have become more important than the rye, oats, barley and dairy cattle which are typical for the whole area.

The republic is Russia's center for growing [[hops]] and is famous throughout the country for its long history of [[beer]] [[brewing]]. It is also a major center for [[electrical engineering]], especially in the area of [[power transmission]] and [[control system]]s.<ref name="USPC" /> Other leading industries are [[metalworking]], [[electricity generation]], and chemical manufacturing. There are also large timber-working mills at Shumerlin.

The largest companies in the region include [[Khimprom Novocheboksarsk]] (revenues of ${{to USD|9600|RUS|year=2017}} million in 2017), [[Accond]] (confectionery maker$, {{to USD|8900|RUS|year=2017}} million), [[Cheboksary Instrument-Making Plant]] (${{to USD|8300|RUS|year=2017}} million), [[NPP EKRA]] (power engineering$, {{to USD|5900|RUS|year=2017}} million).<ref name="regioncompanies">{{cite web |script-title=ru:Выписки ЕГРЮЛ и ЕГРИП, проверка контрагентов, ИНН и КПП организаций, реквизиты ИП и ООО |url=https://sbis.ru/contragents?p=companies |website=СБИС |access-date=20 October 2018 |language=ru}}</ref>

==Transportation==
The [[transport network]] in the republic is one of the most developed in Russia. The republic's system of roads, railroads, waterways, and airports closely ties the region with others in and outside of Russia.<ref name="USPC" />

===Roads===
Only four roads in the Chuvash Republic are classified as important federal highways. The most important is Highway M-7, which runs from Nizhny Novgorod through the northern parts of the republic from [[Yadrinsky Nikolskoye]] via [[Malye Tyumerli]], [[Kalmykovo]], [[Khyrkasy]], [[Novye Lapsary]], [[Kugesi]], [[Shivlinsk]], [[Staraya Tyurlema]], to [[Kazan]] in the [[Republic of Tatarstan]]. It also forms a connection via Chuvashia through the southern suburbs of Cheboksary and Novocheboksary to the [[Mari El Republic]] and the [[Vyatka Highway]]. Part of this road is classified as a motorway, the only one in the republic. From Yadrinsky Nikolskoye, the federal road P-178 runs through [[Yadrin]], [[Shumerlya]], Alatyr, to [[Surskoye]] in [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]] and further to [[Ulyanovsk]]. In the eastern part of Chuvashia, the federal road A-151 runs from [[Tsivilsk]] through [[Kanash]], [[Komsomolskoye, Chuvash Republic|Komsomolskoye]], [[Chkalovskoye, Chuvash Republic|Chkalovskoye]], [[Karabay-Shemursha]], [[Shemursha]] to Ulyanovsk and [[Saratov]]. All other roads in Chuvashia are classified as local area roads.

Automobiles, trucks, and buses are the major forms of transportation, with the republic ranking fourth in highway density in all of Russia.<ref name="USPC" /> Cheboksary is situated on one of the main highways of the Russian Federation leading from [[Moscow]] to the industrial areas of Tatarstan, the southern [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], and [[Siberia]]. A recently completed bridge across the Volga River in the north connects the republic to the developed [[Urals Federal District|Ural]] and [[Volga Federal District]]s. To the south, highways connect Chuvashia with Saratov and [[Volgograd]]. Extensive public and private bus systems connect all towns within the republic with each other and with the surrounding regions.<ref name="USPC" />

The standard speed of transportation of [[containerization|containers]] by road is {{convert|400|km|sp=us}} per day. The average time of delivery from Cheboksary to Moscow is 1.5 days; to [[Saint Petersburg]], 2.5 days; and to [[Western Europe]], 10 to 15 days.<ref name="USPC" />

===Railways===
The railway network is highly developed, convenient, and accessible year-round. One of the largest railway junctions of Russia – [[Kanash]]—is in the center of the republic. Via Kanash, the rail system connects the major towns in Chuvashia with the big industrial centers of eastern [[Siberia]], the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], and Moscow. Express trains are reliable and provide a low-cost, comfortable way to travel. Express trains to and from Moscow are available every day, with the overnight journey taking approximately fourteen hours each way.

The following lines serve railway traffic in the Chuvash Republic:
*[[Arzamas]]-Kanash line
*[[Krasny Usel]] – Kanash -[[Sviyazhsk]] line
*Kanash – Cheboksary II – Cheboksary I – Cheboksary II – [[Novocheboksarsk]] line

In addition to these lines, there are {{convert|26|km|mi|sp=us}} of {{Track gauge|1520mm|lk=on}} gauge industrial lines running from [[Altyshevo]] station, on Alatyr-Kanash section, to [[Pervomaysky, Chuvash Republic|Pervomaysky]], located just west of [[Starye Aybesi]] in [[Alatyrsky District]].

All railway lines in Chuvashia are operated by the MPS [[Gorky Railway]] Division. Steam locomotives were mostly replaced in 1970 by diesel locomotives and when the main [[Arzamas]]-Kanash-[[Sviyazhsk]] line was electrified, the diesel locomotives were replaced by electric ones.

The Arzamas-Kanash-Sviyazhsk line is a double track main line, while the others are single track lines. The 84&nbsp;km (52&nbsp;mi) Sviyazhsk-Kanash section was electrified in 1986, the 142&nbsp;km (88&nbsp;mi) Kanash-Sergach section in 1987.

In 1967, there were four daily passenger trains in both directions on the Alatyr-Kanash line. One of them was the semifast Sochi-Sverdlovsk-Sochi long-distance transit train, halting only at [[Alatyr, Chuvash Republic|Alatyr]], [[Buinsk]], and [[Kanash]]. Cheboksary was connected by daily semifast passenger train to Moscow. The travel time was 17.30{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} hours for the 758&nbsp;km (471&nbsp;mi) journey.  21 express and passenger trains used the Arzamas-Kanash-Sviyazhsk main line in the summer high season in both directions. Of these, four did not halt in Chuvashia. Most of the remaining semifast trains stopped at Shumerlya, Piner, Burnary, and Kanash. Four pairs of semifast trains also stopped at Tyurmari. In the 1999–2000 timetable, 11 pairs of Moscow-Kanash-Kazan express trains stopped at Kanash. The Chuvashia 53/54 express trains between Moscow and Kanash took 11.23 hours, back 10.57 hours.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

In addition to Russian {{Track gauge|1524mm}} gauge railways, there were six {{Track gauge|750mm}} [[narrow gauge railway]] lines: two short [[peat]] briquette industry lines at Severny and Sosnovka on the north side of the Volga, and four forest railways at Shumerlya, Atrat and Kirya. All opened in the 1930s. In 1965, their total length was {{convert|145|km|sp=us}}:
*Shumerlya-Kabanovo-Rechnoy-Burak-Krasnobar forest railway – total length {{convert|72|km|sp=us}}
*Shumerlya-Kumashka-Salantshik-Yakhaykino forest railway – {{convert|46|km|sp=us}}
*Kirya-Lesopunkt Lyulya forest railway – {{convert|13|km|sp=us}}
*Atrat-Dolnaya Polyana-Lesozavod Gart forest railway – {{convert|14|km|sp=us}}

All lines were closed in the economic uncertainty after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

===Rivers===
[[File:Туристы на пикнике.jpg|thumb|[[Volga River]] in Chuvashia]]
The [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Sura River]]s connect Chuvashia to a national and international water network. To the south, [[Volgograd]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Astrakhan]], the [[Caspian Sea]], and [[Black Sea]] are directly reachable. To the west, the Volga River connects Cheboksary with [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Yaroslavl]], Moscow and the northern regions of Russia. By using river-sea vessels, cargo transportation is possible from Chuvash river ports all the way to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Novorossiysk]] (on the Black Sea), [[Astrakhan]], and ports situated on the [[Danube River]]. However, the river is frozen from December through April.<ref name="USPC" /> Cheboksary is a frequent stop on the many boat tours of the Volga.<ref name="USPC" />

===Air===
The international [[Cheboksary Airport]] receives both cargo and passenger aircraft of practically all types and sizes. There are regularly scheduled flights to Moscow and other destinations. Additionally, Cheboksary is about a four-hour drive from [[Strigino International Airport]], the airport primarily serving [[Nizhny Novgorod]], which offers a greater number of flights, including connections through [[Aeroflot]] and [[Belavia]].

==Culture==
While [[Russian language|Russian]] is the predominant business language, the [[Chuvash language]] is still spoken by many, especially in the country. The Chuvash language belongs to the [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] subgroup of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language group]]. In ancient times a [[Orkhon script|runic]] system of writing was used. Chuvashi now uses a [[Cyrillic alphabet variants#Chuvash|modified Cyrillic]] script that was adopted in 1871.

There has been a resurgence of native Chuvash pride, with many people looking back to their Chuvash roots and exploring the culture and heritage and relearning the language. Most building signs, road signs, and announcements are in both Russian and Chuvash.

At present Chuvash Republic has six professional theaters:

*[[Chuvash State Opera and Ballet Theater]]
*[[Chuvash State Academic Drama Theater]]
*[[Chuvash State Academic Song and Dance Ensemble]]
*[[Chuvash Children's Theater]]
*[[Chuvash State Puppet Theater]]
*[[Chuvash State Philharmonic Society]]
*[[Russian State Drama Theater]]
*[[Chuvash State Youth Theater]]
*[[Chuvash State Experimental Drama Theater]]

and over 30 amateur theaters, a Philharmonic Society, an Academic Folk Song and Dance Group, an Academic Choir, a Chamber Orchestra, and some professional concert groups.

There are also more than 20 museums, exhibition halls and modern art galleries.
