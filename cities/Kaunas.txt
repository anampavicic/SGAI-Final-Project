During the [[interwar period]], it served as the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]], when [[Vilnius]] was [[Polish–Lithuanian War|seized]] and controlled by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] between 1920 and 1939.

The city is the capital of [[Kaunas County]], and the seat of the Kaunas city municipality and the [[Kaunas District Municipality]]. It is also the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas]]. Kaunas is located at the confluence of the two largest Lithuanian rivers, the [[Neman|Nemunas]] and the [[Neris]], and is near the [[Kaunas Reservoir]], the largest body of water in the whole of Lithuania.

As defined by Eurostat, the population of Kaunas [[Larger urban zone|functional urban area]], is estimated at 391,153 ({{as of|alt=as of|2023|01}} 2021),<ref>[http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&lang=en "Population on 1 January by age groups and sex - functional urban areas".

==Name==
===Etymology===
[[File:CartaMarina.png|thumb|left|Kaunas is named "Cavm" on [[Carta Marina]] from 1539]]
The city's name is of [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] origin and most likely derives from a [[personal name]], however the exact person is unknown and it is believed that he was the ruler of Kaunas Castle.<ref name="Etimologija">{{cite web |title=Kaunas Lietuva |url=https://www.lithuaniainworld.lt/lt/kaunas-lietuva.html |website=Lithuaniainworld.lt |access-date=12 October 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> The personal name Kaunas is derived from an [[adjective]] {{langx|lt|kaunus|label=none}} which means "who likes to fight".<ref name="Etimologija"/> Other possible meaning of the name of the city of Kaunas is that it is derived from an old adjective which is not in use anymore and which meant "deep", "low", "located in the valley".<ref name="Etimologija"/>

Before Lithuania regained independence, the city was generally known in English as ''Kovno'', the traditional [[Slavic languages|Slavicized]] form of its name. The Polish name is {{lang|pl|Kowno}} {{IPA|pl|ˈkɔvnɔ|}}, and the names in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] include {{lang|be|Koўна}} ({{lang|be-Latn|Kowna}} {{IPA|be|ˈkou̯nɐ|}}) and {{lang|be|Каўнас}} ({{lang|be-latn|Kawnas}} {{IPA|be|ˈkau̯nɐs|}}).<ref>http://www.tnpa.by/#!/FileText/328852/231296</ref> The [[Yiddish]] name is {{lang|yi|קאָװנע}} ''{{lang|yi-Latn|Kovne}}'', and the names in [[German language|German]] include ''{{lang|de|Kaunas}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Kauen}}''. On [[Carta Marina]] from 1539, the city was named ''{{lang|la|Cavm}}''. The city and its [[elderships of Lithuania|elderates]] also have names in other languages (see [[Names of European cities in different languages: I-L#K|Names of Kaunas in other languages]] and [[Names of Lithuanian places in other languages#Elderates of Kaunas|names of Kaunas elderates in other languages]]).

===Folk history===
A 16th-century legend in the ''[[Bychowiec Chronicle]]'' claims that Kaunas was established by the Romans in [[ancient history|ancient times]]. These Romans were supposedly led by a patrician named Palemon, who had three sons: Barcus, Kunas and Sperus.<ref name=palemonas>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Lietuvių enciklopedija |title=Palemonas |first=Zenonas |last=Ivinskis |author-link=Zenonas Ivinskis |location=Boston |publisher=Lietuvių enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1953–1966 |volume=21 |pages=400–401 |lccn=55020366}}</ref><ref name="Etimologija"/> Palemon fled from [[Rome]] because he feared the mad Emperor [[Nero]]. Palemon, his sons and other relatives travelled to Lithuania. After Palemon's death, his sons divided his land. Kunas got the land where Kaunas now stands. He built a fortress near the confluence of the [[Neman|Nemunas]] and [[Neris]] rivers and the city that grew up there was named after him. A suburban region in the vicinity is named "Palemonas".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://palemonas.info/palemonas/kauno-mikrorajonas-palemonas/ |title=Palemonas.info; Kauno mikrorajonas – Palemonas |access-date=13 April 2011 |language=lt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824002842/http://palemonas.info/palemonas/kauno-mikrorajonas-palemonas/ |archive-date=24 August 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to historian [[Teodor Narbutt]] the Lithuanians previously worshiped god Kaunis whose statue was located in the current Kaunas Old Town near [[Neman]] River.<ref name="Etimologija"/>

==Coat of arms==
[[File:Greater Coat of Arms of Kaunas.svg|left|thumb|Great coat of arms of Kaunas]]
In 1408 [[Vytautas the Great]] granted Kaunas the [[Magdeburg rights|city rights]] and himself chose the coat of arms of Kaunas with [[aurochs]].<ref name="LaimaHerbas">{{cite web |last1=Bucevičiūtė |first1=Laima |title=Kaip LDK laikotarpiu atsirado ir keitėsi Kauno herbas? |url=https://kauno.diena.lt/naujienos/kaunas/miesto-pulsas/kaip-ldk-laikotarpiu-atsirado-ir-keitesi-kauno-herbas-844945 |website=Kauno diena |date=5 January 2018 |access-date=4 March 2023 |language=lt}}</ref>

On 30 June 1993, the historical [[coat of arms]] of Kaunas city was re-established by a special [[List of rulers of Lithuania|presidential]] decree. The coat of arms features a white [[aurochs]] with a golden cross between its [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], set against a deep red background. The aurochs was the original heraldic symbol of the city, established in 1400. The heraldic seal of Kaunas, introduced in the early 15th century during the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas, is the oldest city heraldic seal known in the territory of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref name="datos.kvb.lt"/> The current [[emblem]] was the result of much study and discussion on the part of the Lithuanian [[Heraldry]] Commission, and realized by the artist [[Raimondas Miknevicius]]. An aurochs has replaced a [[wisent]], which was depicted in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era emblem that was used since 1969.

Blazon: ''Gules, an [[aurochs]] passant guardant argent ensigned with a cross Or between his horns.''

Kaunas also has a greater coat of arms, which is mainly used for purposes of Kaunas city representation. The sailor, three golden balls, and [[Latin]] text ''"Diligite justitiam qui judicatis terram"'' ([[English language|English]]: Cherish justice, you who judge the earth<ref name="Raffa"/>) in the greater coat of arms refers to [[Saint Nicholas]], patron saint of merchants and seafarers, who was regarded as a heavenly guardian of Kaunas by Queen [[Bona Sforza]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.delfi.lt/kultura/naujienos/tukstantmecio-metu-palydose-bus-pristatytas-didysis-kauno-herbas.d?id=27325801 |title=Tūkstantmečio metų palydose bus pristatytas didysis Kauno herbas |website=DELFI}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaunas.lt/ |title=Kauno miesto savivaldybė}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
According to the [[Excavation (archaeology)|archeological excavations]], the richest collections of [[ceramic art|ceramics]] and other artifacts found at the confluence of the [[Neman|Nemunas]] and the [[Neris]] rivers are from the [[2nd millennium BC|second]] and [[1st millennium BC|first millennium]] [[Anno Domini|BC]]. During that time, people settled in some territories of the present Kaunas: the confluence of the two [[List of rivers of Lithuania|longest rivers of Lithuania]] area, [[Eiguliai]], Lampėdžiai, Linkuva, Kaniūkai, Marvelė, Pajiesys, [[Romainiai]], [[Petrašiūnai]], Sargėnai, and Veršvai sites.<ref name="datos.kvb.lt"/>

Kaunas has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Dfb) with an average annual temperature of approximately {{Convert|7|C}}.

Despite its northern location, the climate in Kaunas is relatively mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Because of its latitude, Kaunas has 17 hours of daylight in midsummer but only around 7 hours in midwinter. The [[Kazlų Rūda]] Forest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regionai.stat.gov.lt/en/marijampoles_apskritis/kazlu_rudos_savivaldybe.html|title=Portrait of the Regions of Lithuania; Kazlų Rūda Municipality|access-date=6 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526221611/http://regionai.stat.gov.lt/en/marijampoles_apskritis/kazlu_rudos_savivaldybe.html|archive-date=26 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> west of Kaunas, creates a [[microclimate]] around the city, regulating humidity and temperature of the air, and protecting it from strong westerly winds.

Summers in Kaunas are warm and pleasant with average daytime high temperatures of {{convert|21|-|22|C}} and lows of around {{convert|12|C}}, but temperatures could reach {{convert|30|C}} on some days. Winters are relatively cold, and sometimes snowy with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|-8|to|0|C}}, and rarely drop below {{convert|-15|C}}. Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild.

Kaunas is a city centered around culture. The [[Centras eldership|Old Town]] of Kaunas is located at the confluence of the Nemunas and Neris Rivers where old architectural monuments and other historical buildings are located. Located to the East of the Old Town is the city's New Town, which started developing in 1847 and got its name when it became a distinct part of the city.<ref name="Tanks"/> [[Centras eldership|Central Kaunas]] is defined by two pedestrian streets: the 1.6&nbsp;km long [[Laisvės alėja]] (Liberty Avenue), a central street of the city, lined by [[Tilia cordata|linden trees]] and decorated with flower beds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biliukevičiūtė |first1=Jurgita |title=Laisvės alėja |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/laisves-aleja/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=12 June 2023 |language=lt}}</ref>

The [[Centras eldership|Old Town]] is the historical center of Kaunas. The streets in Old Town have been turned to pedestrian sidewalks, so it is best to tour the place by foot. Prominent features of the Old Town include [[Kaunas Castle]], the [[Town Hall, Kaunas|Town Hall]], and the historical [[Historical Presidential Palace, Kaunas|Presidential Palace]]. The Town Hall in Kaunas played an important role in the Medieval Times as a center for trade, festivals, and criminals were brought here for punishment. The Town Hall was originally built with wooden frames, however, after numerous fires in 1542 they began to construct buildings with stone. The stone buildings, however, also burned down so the Town Hall that stands today was constructed in a more advanced way, which took from 1771 to 1780. The Town Hall is still a center of culture today, it holds weddings and is the home of the Museum of Ceramics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lithuania: A State at the Centre of Europe|last=Semaska|first=Algimantas|publisher=Algimantas|year=2013|isbn=978-609-423-011-0|location=Vilnius|pages=65–76}}</ref>

In the first half of the 20th century, when Kaunas became the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]] in 1919, the city was extensively modernized and thousands of new buildings were built. From 1918 to 1940 more than 12.000 construction permits were issued in Kaunas, which was an extremely rapid growth for a relatively small-scale city (90.000 inhabitants) that fundamentally changed the city's character.<ref>{{cite web |title=Modernusis Kaunas: optimizmo architektūra, 1919–1939 |url=https://modernizmasateiciai.lt/unesco/ |website=modernizmasateiciai.lt |access-date=12 July 2020}}</ref> The construction permits resulted in more than 10.000 buildings being built in the city and the area of Kaunas expanded 7,1 times during the interwar period.<ref name="IPKaunas"/> [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] prevailed in the 3rd decade of the 20th century ([[Kaunas School of Arts]], built in 1923, [[Bank of Lithuania]] building, built in 1928, [[Palace of Justice and the Parliament]] with [[Art Deco]] elements, built in 1930) and a search for the Lithuanian national style was typical (e.g. residential house of ''Ragutis'' factory, built in 1925<ref>{{cite web |title=Fabriko "Ragutis" gyvenamasis namas |url=http://www.autc.lt/lt/architekturos-objektai/961?id=961 |website=autc.lt |language=lt |access-date=12 July 2020}}</ref>).<ref name="KaunasArchitecture"/> The styles of Classicism and [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] intertwined in buildings built in the beginning of 1930s (e.g. Faculty of Medicine at [[Vytautas Magnus University]], built in 1933, now belongs to the [[Lithuanian University of Health Sciences]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Faculty of Medicine at Vytautas Magnus University |url=http://www.autc.lt/en/architecture-objects/1022 |website=autc.lt}}</ref> [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]] and [[M.

After [[World War II]] buildings of pseudoclassical forms were built (e.g. [[Kaunas railway station]], built in 1953), complex engineering structures ([[Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant]], built in 1960). From the 7th decade of the 20th century Modernism style buildings were further developed. New residential areas were built (e.g. [[Kalniečiai]], completed in 1985), public buildings (e.g. Industrial Construction Design Institute, 1966,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pramoninės statybos projektavimo instituto rūmai ("Pramprojektas") |url=http://www.autc.lt/lt/architekturos-objektai/209 |website=autc.lt |language=lt |access-date=13 July 2020}}</ref> House for Political Education (now part of [[Vytautas Magnus University]]), 1976),<ref>{{cite web |title=House for Political Education (now Vytautas Magnus University) |url=http://www.autc.lt/en/architecture-objects/570 |website=autc.lt |access-date=13 July 2020}}</ref> shopping malls (e.g. Girstupis, 1975, Vitebskas, 1980, Kalniečių, 1986), shops (Viešnagė, 1982, Merkurijus, 1983), galleries (e.g. [[Kaunas Picture Gallery]], 1978, [[Mykolas Žilinskas Art Gallery]], 1989), educational institutions (e.g. Faculty of Light Industry at Kaunas University of Technology, 1983).<ref name="KaunasArchitecture"/>

At the time of paganism Lithuanian children were educated at home schools near [[Manorialism|manors]], however following the [[Christianization of Lithuania]] in 1387 schools began to be established near churches and the first [[parochial school]] in Kaunas was established in 1473.<ref name="datos.kvb.lt"/><ref name="SvietimasLDK">{{cite web |title=Švietimas Lietuvos Didžiojoje Kunigaikštystėje |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/svietimas-lietuvos-didziojoje-kunigaikstysteje/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> The ability to write was essential for Kaunas' merchants, craftsmen and employees of the offices of city self-government institutions work.<ref name="MokyklosAutc">{{cite web |title=Mokyklos Kaune XVI‑XVIII a. pirmojoje pusėje |url=http://kaunosenamiestis.autc.lt/lt/paieska/teksto-zinute/26/mokyklos-kaune-xvi-xviii-a-pirmojoje-puseje |website=Kaunosenamiestis.autc.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref>

In 1648, Kaunas [[Jesuit]] College ({{langx|la|Collegium Caunense}}) was established and until 1702 its status as ''collegium inchoatum'' settled down, which meant a [[high school]] with a shortened [[philosophy]] course.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kasperavičiūtė |first1=Vitalija |title=Jėzuitų ir Edukacims komisijos mokyklos Kaune: sąveika ir perimamumas (XVIII a.) |journal=Kauno istorijos metraštis |page=51 |url=https://etalpykla.lituanistika.lt/object/LT-LDB-0001:J.04~2002~1367184063033/J.04~2002~1367184063033.pdf |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> Therefore, in the 16th–18th centuries Kaunas had education with levels from primary to secondary school and the studies met demands not only of Kaunas but also of the surrounding area.<ref name="MokyklosAutc"/>

On 14 October 1773, the [[Commission of National Education]] was created by the [[Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the Grand Duke [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], which supervised universities, schools and was responsible for other educational matters in the Commonwealth. Because of its vast authority and autonomy, it is considered as the first [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of [[Education]] in European history and an important achievement of the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Enlightenment in the Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=God's Playground: 1795 to the present |url=https://archive.org/details/godsplaygroundhi00norm_0 |url-access=registration |access-date=17 August 2024 |date=28 February 2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12819-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/godsplaygroundhi00norm_0/page/167 167]}}</ref> At the time the education province of Lithuania was assigned to be managed by [[Vilnius University]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Edukacinė komisija |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/edukacine-komisija/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref>

Following the [[Partitions of Poland|Third Partition of the Commonwealth]], Kaunas and [[Lithuania proper]] became a part of the Russian Empire. In 1843, the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] of the [[Kražiai College]], one of the most important centers of education and Jesuit science in Lithuania, was transferred from [[Kražiai]] to Kaunas, and currently it is named [[Kaunas Maironis University Gymnasium]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kražių kolegija |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/kraziu-kolegija/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Istorija |url=http://kmug.lt/apie-gimnazija/istorija/ |website=Kauno Maironio universitetinė gimnazija |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> In 1848, Kaunas became capital of the [[Kovno Governorate]] which had 197 Lithuanian primary schools, however the education was greatly affected by the [[Lithuanian press ban]] (1865–1904) and [[Russification]] policies, especially after the 1863 [[January Uprising]].<ref name="SvietimasRI">{{cite web |title=Švietimas Lietuvoje Rusijos imperijos valdymo metais |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/svietimas-lietuvoje-rusijos-imperijos-valdymo-metais/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> Nevertheless, Kovno Governorate was one of the leading governorates by population [[literacy]] – 55,3%, compared to the average of 19% of population (9 years or older) of the Russian Empire in 1897).<ref>{{cite web |title=Kauno gubernija |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/kauno-gubernija/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref><ref name="RastingumasVle">{{cite web |title=Raštingumas |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/rastingumas/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref>

Following the adoption of the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]] in 1918, the [[Government of Lithuania]] was soon forced to retreat from [[Vilnius]] to Kaunas in January 1919, therefore since 1919 the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Lithuania)|Ministry of Education of Lithuania]] operated in Kaunas.<ref name="SM">{{cite web |title=Tarpukario Lietuvą menantis pastatas Kaune: čia buvo sprendžiami svarbiausi valstybės klausimai |url=https://www.delfi.lt/multimedija/archyvas/zvilgsnis-i-lietuva/tarpukario-lietuva-menantis-pastatas-kaune-cia-buvo-sprendziami-svarbiausi-valstybes-klausimai-73750532 |website=DELFI |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> These events resulted in the influx to Kaunas of Lithuanian intellectuals (e.g. [[Jonas Jablonskis]], [[Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas]]) and teachers who began educational activities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Prieš 100 metų Kaunas tapo laikinąja sostine |url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/pries-100-metu-kaunas-tapo-laikinaja-sostine-56-1081994 |website=15min.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> During the [[interwar period]] the Lithuanian [[educational system]] was transformed based on Western countries examples and the [[Constituent Assembly of Lithuania]] adopted the Primary Schools Act which required 7-11-year-old children to attend free primary education for four years (the primary education was prolonged to six years in 1936) and many new schools for various ages pupils were established.<ref name="Svietimas18-40">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos Respublikos švietimo sistema 1918–1940 |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/lietuvos-respublikos-svietimo-sistema-1918-1940/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> Moreover, children were taught [[patriotism]] from an early age, later children joined [[Ateitis]] and [[Lietuvos Skautija]] organizations, while school notebooks covers for pupils were printed with famous Lithuanian personalities portraits (e.g. [[Vytautas]], [[Birutė]], [[Jonas Basanavičius]], etc.).<ref name="patriot">{{cite web |title=Tarpukaris: vaikų patriotizmą ugdė ir sąsiuvinių viršeliai |url=https://kaunas.kasvyksta.lt/2018/06/17/kultura/tarpukaris-vaiku-patriotizma-ugde-ir-sasiuviniu-virseliai/ |website=Kaunas.kasvyksta.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> In 1922, the [[Kaunas Art School]] was established in Kaunas and it was the only public [[art school]] in interwar Lithuania.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kauno meno mokykla |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/kauno-meno-mokykla/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> In 1931, Jonas Laužikas established a [[special education]] school in Kaunas which was the first such type school in Lithuania and it still operates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pirmosios vaikų su intelekto negaliomis mokyklos direktorė: baisiausia buvo sovietmečiu |url=https://www.delfi.lt/seima/klasiu-kovos/pirmosios-vaiku-su-intelekto-negaliomis-mokyklos-direktore-baisiausia-buvo-sovietmeciu-96126273 |website=Delfi.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> The overall improvement of education system during the interwar period resulted in 92% of literacy rate of the population in Lithuania in 1939 (mostly only part of the older age inhabitants were still illiterate).<ref name="RastingumasVle"/>

Until the 20th century Kaunas had no tertiary education institutions as the [[Vilnius University]] (est. 1579) for centuries was the only [[university]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], but it was closed in 1832 by the [[tsarist]] authorities and the [[Council of Lithuania]] desired to revive it in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Universitetas Vilniuje tarpukariu: nuo prašmatnių pokylių iki išdaužytų langų |url=https://www.15min.lt/gyvenimas/naujiena/ar-zinai/universitetas-vilniuje-tarpukariu-nuo-prasmatniu-pokyliu-iki-slibino-gatvese-ir-mustyniu-1634-1215398 |website=15min.lt |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> However, during the [[Vilnius Region#Vilnius dispute|conflict for the Vilnius Region]] the Lithuanians were unable to maintain control in the since 1918 declared capital [[Vilnius]] with the remnants of the Vilnius University which was firstly [[Battles for Vilnius (1918–1919)|captured by the Bolsheviks]] in January 1919, then by the [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|Polish forces in November 1920]] and was eventually annexed by Poland in 1922 which left a newly restored Lithuania without any tertiary education institutions, therefore Lithuanian intellectuals sought to promptly establish it.<ref name="KurStoti">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos universitetas – nuo 1922 m. iki dabar |url=https://www.kurstoti.lt/s/4575/lietuvos-universitetas-nuo-1922-m-iki-dabar |website=Journal Kur stoti |access-date=17 August 2024 |language=lt}}</ref>

[[File:Kaunas at night.jpg|thumb|[[Vytautas the Great Bridge]]]]
The construction of the Kaunas Railway Tunnel and Railway Bridge across the Nemunas river helped move goods from the eastern part of [[Russian Empire]] west to the [[German Empire]] and Kaunas grew rapidly in the second part of the 19th century. The oldest part of Kaunas was connected with [[Žaliakalnis]] neighbourhood in 1889. The city increased once more when it was connected by bridges with [[Aleksotas]] and [[Vilijampolė]] districts in the 1920s.[[Kaunas#cite note-41|[2]]]

Since Kaunas is located at the confluence of two rivers, there were 34 bridges and viaducts built in the city at the end of 2007, including:
* [[Vytautas the Great Bridge]], connecting [[Old Town (Kaunas)|Old Town]] with [[Aleksotas]] across the [[Neman|Nemunas]]
