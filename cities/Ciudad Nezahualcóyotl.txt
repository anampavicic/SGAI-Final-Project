'''Nezahualcóyotl''' ({{IPA|es|sjuˈðað nesawalˈkoʝotl}}), or more commonly '''Neza''', is a city and [[municipal seat]] of the [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] of Nezahualcóyotl in [[Mexico]]. It is located in the [[List of states of Mexico|state]] of [[State of Mexico|Mexico]], adjacent to the east side of [[Mexico City]]. The municipality comprises its own [[intrastate region]], [[Region IX (Mexico State)]].

It was named after [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], the [[Acolhua]] poet and king of nearby [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], which was built on the drained bed of [[Lake Texcoco]]. The name ''Nezahualcóyotl'' comes from [[Nahuatl]], meaning "fasting [[coyote]]". Nezahualcóyotl's [[heraldry]] includes an [[Aztec writing|Aztec glyph]] as well as a [[coat of arms]]. The glyph depicts the head of a coyote, tongue outside the mouth with a collar or necklace as a symbol of royalty (one of the ways of depicting the Aztec king). The current coat of arms, which includes the glyph, was authorized by the municipality in the 1990s.<ref name="encmuc">{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15058a.htm |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Mexico Nezahualcóyotl |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=es |access-date=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031540/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15058a.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref><ref name="eponia">{{cite news |title=Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl |first=Elena |last=Poniatowska |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/05/12/a07a1cul.php |newspaper=La Jornada |publisher=UNAM |location=Mexico City |date=12 May 2005 |access-date=18 January 2010 |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604110037/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/05/12/a07a1cul.php |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Until the 20th century, the land on which Ciudad Neza sits was under [[Lake Texcoco]] and uninhabited. Successful draining of the lake in the early 20th century created new land, which the government eventually sold into private hands. However, public services such as adequate potable water, electricity and sewerage were lacking until after the area was made an independent municipality in 1963.<ref name="encmuc"/> Today, Ciudad Neza is a sprawling city of over one million, mostly living in slums.

As of 2006, Nezahualcóyotl includes part of the world's largest [[shanty town]], along with [[Valle de Chalco|Chalco]] and [[Ixtapaluca|Ixta]].<ref>[[:en:Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]], ''Planet of Slums'', La Découverte, Paris, 2006 ({{ISBN|978-2-7071-4915-2}}), p. 31.</ref> Most of its population is poor<ref name="kugel">{{cite news |title=Urban Tactics – Destination, Neza York |first=Seth |last=Kugel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/15/nyregion/urban-tactics-destination-neza-york.html?pagewanted=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |date=15 February 2004 |access-date=18 January 2010}}</ref> and have migrated from other parts of Mexico.<ref name="eponia"/> It also has a very high crime rate,<ref name="violencia">{{cite news |title=Ejército-seguridad |agency=Agencia el Universal |newspaper=El Universal. |location=Mexico City |date=4 January 2010 |language=es |trans-title=Army-security}}</ref> in part due to ''[[cholo]]s'', gangs that formed in the 1990s based upon [[gangs in the United States]] (especially [[Los Angeles]]).<ref name="slopez">{{cite news |title=Los cholos de 'Nezayork' |first=Susana |last=López Peña |url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/noticieros/376243.html |newspaper=Noticieros Televisa |location=Mexico City |access-date=18 January 2010 |language=es |trans-title=The cholos of "Neza York" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208180037/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/noticieros/376243.html |archive-date=8 December 2008}}</ref> Since the 2000s, a significant number of natives of this city have immigrated to the United States, mostly settling in [[New York City|New York]].

==History==
[[File:StatueNezahualcoyotlCdNeza.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Nezahualcóyotl in the main plaza]]
Nezahualcoyotl, for whom the city and municipality were named, was the lord of Texcoco, one of the allies of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]]. Texcoco dominated the area in which the modern municipality stands; however the land on which Ciudad Neza stands was under Lake Texcoco until the 20th century. Drainage of the interconnected lakes of the Valley of Mexico began in the early colonial period. The first major drainage project was begun in 1590, with the aim of eliminating the chronic flooding that plagued Mexico City. By the time of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], flooding was still common in the Mexico City area, and at that time a project was begun to drain Lake Texcoco directly. The Lake Texcoco area was declared federal property in 1912, after which efforts to completely drain the lake commenced which continued until the 1930s. Starting in 1917 under [[Venustiano Carranza]], efforts to determine legal ownership of lands that began to appear due to the drainage of the lake were undertaken. Most of this land was declared federal property to be sold. In 1933, the Mexico City–[[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] highway was built through this area. The first settlements in what is now the municipality were extensions of the municipalities of [[Chimalhuacán]], [[Los Reyes Acaquilpan|La Paz]] and [[Ecatepec de Morelos|Ecatepec]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

The area was known for a bird species called the [[Wilson's plover|chichicuilote-atziztizuilotl]], which inhabited the lakes and ponds of the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Today it is nearly extinct.<ref name="mexdes">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6070-Hablando-de-aves |title=Hablando de aves |first=Carlos |last=Romero Giordano |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=Speaking of birds |access-date=18 January 2010}}</ref> The center of the city had an area that specialized in the sale of the bird, both alive and cooked.<ref name="eponia"/> 

These initial settlements were without infrastructure or public services, and efforts to procure these began in the 1940s. In 1945 the Xochiaca dam and the Tequixquiac tunnel were built, the diversion of potable water allowed for the creation of the first formal neighborhoods of Juárez Pantitlán, México and El Sol. By 1949, the area had 2,000 inhabitants.<ref name="encmuc"/> In the 1950s the population of the area grew quickly as people from various parts of Mexico immigrated to the Mexico City area in search of opportunity.<ref name="eponia"/> This grew to 40,000 by 1954, despite the lack of other services such as electricity. The area gained more formal administrative status from the state of Mexico in the 1950s as it grew, but by 1959, a group representing the now-33 neighborhoods of the area protested the lack of services, which still included sufficient potable water.<ref name="encmuc"/> 

In 1960, the idea emerged to separate this area from the municipality of Chimalhuacán in order to create a new municipality. By this time, the area had a population of 80,000. This idea culminated into the creation of the municipality of Nezahualcóyotl on 3 April 1963 by the state legislature, with Jorge Sáenza Gómez Knoth as the first municipal president.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Conversion of the area into a municipality helped greatly in getting water, pavement, sewer and streetlights in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="eponia"/> However, the sale of land here was legally complicated due to problems in land title. This began to be regulated in the mid-1970s and would continue through the 1980s and into part of the 1990s.<ref name="encmuc"/>

By the early 1980s, major public buildings such as hospitals, the municipal palace, schools, libraries and the Museum of Archeology had been built. The [[Xochiaca]] area had become a landfill with a sports facility built along its edge.<ref name="encmuc"/> 

The city grew quickly during the 1980s with new neighborhoods, shopping centers and other urban areas built. It became necessary to have a municipal committee dedicated to the control of urban growth.<ref name="encmuc"/> 

In the 1990s the Ciudad Deportiva (Sports City) and the Universidad Tecnológica de Nezahualcóyotl were established. The population surpassed one million by 1995.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The city has produced a number of athletes, such as Humberto "La Chiquita" González and Graciela Hernández, the first of many [[wheelchair basketball]] gold medalists in the [[Pan American Games]].<ref name="eponia"/> 

==The city==
[[File:CiudadNezaHorseGarbageTruck.JPG|thumb|Horse drawn garbage truck in Ciudad Neza]]
The city is looked down upon by the residents of Mexico City proper, calling it "mi-Nezota" or "Neza York," which refers to its sprawling size, and urban atmosphere devoid of the colonial structures in the center of town.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="kugel"/> Trash collection is still done by donkey cart in a number of areas of the city.<ref name="kugel"/> The city has one of the highest crime rates in the State of Mexico.<ref name="violencia"/>

However, the city is also home of the ''Orquesta Sinfónica Infantil y Banda Sinfónica de Nezahualcóyotl'' ("Junior Symphony Orchestra and Symphony Band of Nezahualcóyotl"), created in 1998. It is composed of 45 members ranging in age from 6 to 17 years. It is the only organization of its type in the State of Mexico. It has won various awards, including the "Premio estatal de la juventud 2002" (State Youth Prize of 2002). The orchestra has performed over 200 times, most of these concerts outside of the city itself. It is directed by Roberto Sánchez Chavez.<ref name="Oinfantil">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdneza.gob.mx/index.php?id=tsitio&urls=orquesta |title=Orquesta Sinfónica Infantil de Nezahualcóyotl (OSIN) y Banda Sinfónica de Nezahualcóyotl. |publisher=Municipality of Nezahualcóyotl |location=Cd Nezahualcóyotl, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Children's Symphony Orchestra of Nezahualcóyotl and Symphonic Band of Nezahualcóyotl |access-date=18 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722224737/http://www.cdneza.gob.mx/index.php?id=tsitio&urls=orquesta |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

All of its civil constructions such as the municipal palace, the Casa de Cultura, the Alfredo del Mazo Vélez Auditorium and others are of modern design. In front of the municipal palace there are monuments to Nezahualcóyotl, [[Cuauhtémoc]] and [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] located on the Plaza Unión de Fuerzas.<ref name="encmuc"/> Germán Aréchiga Torres is history writer specialist in this place.

Since 2013 the city has had its own cathedral, officially called the [[Cathedral of Jesús Señor de la Divina Misericordia]] (Jesus of the Divine Mercy), but is more commonly called the Cathedral of Nezahualcóyotl. The cathedral was inaugurated by ex bishop José María Hernández González and contains an adjoining chapel, [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], bookstore and exterior altarpieces which contains the Lord's Prayer in six languages: Spanish, [[Latin]], Nahuatl, [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name="mural">{{cite news |title=Neza ya tiene Catedral.(Nacional) |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-124324319/neza-ya-tiene-catedral.html |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara |date=21 November 2000 |access-date=18 January 2010 |language=es |trans-title=Neza now has a cathedral (National)}}</ref><ref name="catgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdneza.gob.mx/index.php?id=tsitio&urls=catedral |title=Catedral de Nezahualcóyotl |publisher=Municipality of Nezahualcóyotl |location=Cd Nezahualcóyotl, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Cathedral of Nezahualcóyotl |access-date=18 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722225100/http://www.cdneza.gob.mx/index.php?id=tsitio&urls=catedral |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The year after its opening, the cathedral was robbed of an urn and the sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de María Faustina de Polonia, with a value of over 300,000 pesos.<ref name="jlazaro">{{cite news |title=Neza: robo de arte sacro en la catedral |first=Juan |last=Lázaro |url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=39735&tabla=estados |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=10 November 2001 |access-date= 18 January 2010 |language=es |trans-title= Neza: Theft of sacred art in the cathedral |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615033828/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=39735&tabla=estados |archive-date= 15 June 2011 |url-status= dead}}</ref> The main cultural center for the city is the ''Centro Cultural Jaime Torres Bodet'' '''('''named for [[Jaime Torres Bodet]]) inaugurated on 25 August 1987.

The ''Ciudad Deportiva'' is a sports center that was built in 1990. It is located on the edge of what was the Bordo de Xochiaca landfill. This was the first stage of the reclamation of the landfill area, and sports facilities for volleyball, tennis, soccer (for children and adults), baseball and other sports were built.<ref name="cdepor">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdneza.gob.mx/index.php?id=tsitio&urls=cd_deportiva |title=Ciudad Deportiva de Nezahualcóyotl |publisher=Municipality of Nezahualcóyotl |location=Cd Nezahualcóyotl, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Sports City of Nezahualcóyotl |access-date=18 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722225136/http://www.cdneza.gob.mx/index.php?id=tsitio&urls=cd_deportiva |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Cholos===
To be a "cholo" is to be a part of a youth subculture associated with drugs and gangs which is strongly associated with Ciudad Neza.<ref name="ssanchez">{{cite news |title=La vida loca |first=Saúl |last=Sánchez Lemus |url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/losreporteros/387110.html |newspaper=Noticieros Televisa |location=Mexico City |access-date=18 January 2010 |language=es |trans-title=The Crazy Life |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124202145/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/losreporteros/387110.html |archive-date=24 January 2010}}</ref> The word cholo, as used in various Latin American countries, referred to a person of mixed race ([[mestizo]]) from the lower classes. The origin of the cholo culture stems from the "[[pachuco]]" culture of the United States in the 1940s among the Hispanics there, which eventually morphed into the gangs that populate cities such as Los Angeles. The phenomenon of gangs came to Mexico from the U.S. in the 1980s.<ref name="slopez"/> The first Mexican cholo groups came about in the 1990s, and were called by various names, such as "barrios," "[[clique|clickas]]" and "gangas." Many of these groups were formed by youths who had spent time in the United States and returned with a different identity.<ref name="ssanchez"/> Most cholos are youths between 13 and 25 years old who generally do not finish school beyond the eighth grade.<ref name="slopez"/> These groups mimic the organization of gangs found in the United States, especially California. Cholos have their own style of dress and speech. They are known for hand signals, tattoos and graffiti. They are also involved in the use and sale of drugs, especially [[marijuana]]. Groups of cholos control various territories in the city. Most of the violence among these groups is over territory.<ref name="ssanchez"/> Some of the better known cholo gangs in Neza are "41 Street," "DK13," "Cobras 13," "Los Sur 13," "Cobras 38," "Los Mexican," "Los de la 33," "Cacos 13," "La 14" and the "Sur Kings."<ref name="slopez"/>

The former municipal president, Luis Sánchez, states that this kind of activity is waning and claims only two cholo groups are true active gangs. The rest are imitations of the lifestyle as a type of counterculture. He also states that no more than 500 youths belong to the gangs which have been identified by the authorities. Other sources state that this is not true and more than 100 groups operate in the city with many more members.<ref name="slopez"/><ref name="ssanchez"/>

==The old Bordo de Xochiaca landfill==

The Bordo de Xochiaca landfill was one of the largest landfills in the Valley of Mexico,<ref name="deportivo">{{cite news |title=Edomex-Deportivo |agency=Agencia el Universal |newspaper=El Universal. |location=Mexico City |date=2 January 2010 |language=es |trans-title=State of Mexico-Sports}}</ref> covering {{cvt|150|ha}}.<ref name="aramos">{{cite news |title=Crean 'ciudad' en ex basurero |first=Alejandro |last=Ramos |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=15 November 2009 |page=4 |language=es |trans-title=Creating a "city" in a former dump}}</ref> It was an open-pit landfill which operated from the 1970s until it was closed in 2006.<ref name="aramos"/> At one time it was ranked as one of the dirtiest in the world by the [[World Bank]]. At the time of closure, it was estimated to receive an average of about <ref>{{Cite web |last=C.V |first=DEMOS, Desarrollo de Medios, S. A. de |date=2015-03-23 |title=La Jornada: El ayuntamiento de Nezahualcóyotl inaugura el parque acuático El Pulpo |url=https://www.jornada.com.mx/2015/03/23/estados/035n3est |access-date=2023-07-22 |website=www.jornada.com.mx |language=es-MX}}</ref><ref name="Gutierrez"/> twelve thousand tons of trash.<ref name="deportivo"/><ref name="aramos"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://expansion.mx/planetacnn/2010/10/05/un-ex-basurero-en-el-estado-de-mexico-se-transformo-en-una-ciudad-jardin |title=Un ex basurero en el Estado de México se transformó en una ciudad jardín |website=expansion.mx|date=5 October 2010 }}</ref>

In the 2000s, a project called [[Ciudad Jardín Bicentenario]] was undertaken to seal the landfill and reclaim the land for various purposes. The project first aimed to close and seal the landfill. At the start of the project, about 600 people, who lived around the fill making a living by sorting through the trash were relocated. Next steps were taken to stabilize the ground and install a system to monitor and manage [[methane]] and other gases produced by the decomposing garbage. {{cvt|2500|m}} of tubes were laid to collect methane gas to lead the collected material to an extraction station. The gas is extracted to keep it from going directly into the atmosphere and to use it for fuel, principally to produce electricity. Investors also predict that the recovery system will prevent {{cvt|93000|t}} of [[carbon dioxide]] from entering the atmosphere. Rainwater catchment systems were also placed in the area to capture and reuse runoff for the irrigation and cleaning of the {{cvt|350000|m2}} of grass that has been planted on the site.<ref name="aramos"/>

The entire project has required an investment of three billion pesos, with most of the money coming from [[Grupo Carso]], headed by [[Carlos Slim Helú]]. The Ciudad Jardín Bicentenario contains a shopping mall, a rehabilitation center related to the [[Teletón (Mexico)|Teletón]], campuses of the [[Lasallian educational institutions|Universidad de La Salle]] and the [[Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México]], offices of the federal judiciary, an installation of the [[Telmex]] Foundation, a hospital called VIVO associated with the Star Médica association.<ref name="aramos"/>

Lastly, the landfill area also contains the expansion and completion of the Ciudad Deportiva. The facilities were finished in 2009 and stated by investors to be the most modern sports facility in Mexico. The facility was inaugurated in March 2009 by state Governor [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] and principal investor Carlos Slim Helú. It contains a nearly Olympic-sized stadium, a cycling track, two gymnasiums, 25 [[soccer]] fields, five for [[indoor soccer]], two [[American football]] fields, four tennis courts, four basketball courts, four [[volleyball]] courts, two [[jai alai]] courts, two baseball fields, an [[aerobics]] floor, playgrounds and recreational areas. However, as of January 2010, it is closed to the public because state and municipal authorities have not regularized the title of the land on which it sits.<ref name="deportivo"/> Entrance to the facilities will be free, due to corporate sponsorship to cover administrative costs.<ref name="aramos"/>

The project has generated over six thousand jobs directly and indirectly and will benefit more than two million inhabitants of Nezahualcóyotl, Chimalhuacán and other areas of the eastern Valley of Mexico.<ref name="aramos"/>

==Neza York/New York==
Until the 2000s, most migrants to the United States, especially to places like New York, were from poor rural areas. However, since the turn of the century, another wave of immigrants is coming from poor urban areas such as Nezahualcóyotl. These immigrants tend to be younger and better educated than their rural counterparts, and this tends to separate the communities. This is creating a new Mexican subculture called "Neza York" distinguished by dress, speech and the likelihood of learning English. Businesses with names like Tacos Neza and Neza Grocery have appeared in New York City.<ref name="kugel"/> 

==The municipality==
[[File:Gemeente Nezahualcoyotl.PNG|thumb|right|250px|City of Netzahualcoyotl's location within the State of Mexico]]
The city of Nezahualcóyotl is nearly co extensive with the municipality of Nezahualcóyotl with 99.46% of the municipality's population of 1,110,565 (as of 2010) living within the city limits. Only six localities are considered to be outside the city proper: Colonia Gustavo Baz Prada, Ciudad Jardín, Relleno Sanitario Nezahualcóyotl Segundo, Polígonos, Escuela Laura Riojas de Colosio and 17 de Junio, but the city functions as the local government for these communities. It is the second most populous municipality in the [[State of Mexico]], just below Ecatepec, and the ninth largest in the country.<ref name="2010 census tables: INEGI">[http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 2010 census tables: INEGI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502025339/http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 |date=2 May 2013 }}</ref> It lies at 2,220 meters above sea level.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The municipality is located in the east of the Valley of Mexico and is part of [[Greater Mexico City]]. The municipality borders the municipalities of Ecatepec de Morelos, La Paz, Chimalhuacán and [[San Salvador Atenco]] in the State of Mexico. To the west and south, it borders the borough of [[Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.|Gustavo A. Madero]], [[Venustiano Carranza, D.F.|Venustiano Carranza]], [[Iztapalapa]] and [[Iztacalco]] of Mexico City and at the northwest it borders the remains of the Federal Zone of Lake Texcoco.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The municipality has a territory of 63.44&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 81% of which is occupied by the city, which consists of 86 neighborhoods called colonias. The rest is part of the Federal Zone of the Ex-Basin of Texcoco. The municipality is flat with only one elevation reading 1,220 meters above sea level. The Los Remedios and a brand of the Churubusco River run through here. At the far northeast is a remnant of Lake Texcoco and an artificial lake was built here as part of the Parque del Puebla to serve as an ecological reserve. The climate is temperate with a fairly cold winter and rain mostly falling between June and October. Average temperature is about 15C with temperatures as high as 34C and as low as −5C. The area has little to no native wild flora and fauna due to the fact that it was underwater until the 20th century and the area is nearly completely urbanized. However, in winter a number of bird species such as [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[stork]]s pass through.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Because of it urban nature, there is no agriculture in the area and livestock production is minimal, restricted to the very northeastern edges of the municipality and only for self consumption. The economy of the municipality is mostly based on commerce, employing over 90% of the population. The second major employer is industry, mostly microindustries.<ref name="encmuc"/>
