'''Tartu County''' ({{lang-et|Tartu maakond}} or ''Tartumaa'') is one of 15 [[counties of Estonia]].

It is located in eastern Estonia bordering [[Põlva County]], [[Valga County]], [[Viljandi County]] and [[Jõgeva County]].

The area of Tartu County is {{convert|2,992.74|km2|abbr=on}}, which covers 6.9% of the territory of Estonia. In 2022 Tartu County had a population of 157,758 – constituting 11.9% of the total population in Estonia.<ref name="County_population">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.ee/49512|title=Estonia’s natural increase in 2010 was positive again after 20 years|date=25 April 2011|work=stat.ee|publisher=[[Statistics Estonia]]|access-date=2011-05-03}}</ref> The city of [[Tartu]] is the centre of the county located at a distance of {{convert|186|km|abbr=on}} from [[Tallinn]]. Tartu County is divided into 8 local governments – 1 urban and 7 rural municipalities.

== Geography ==
Tartu County lies in South Estonia, between [[Lake Võrtsjärv]] and [[Lake Peipus]]. Estonia's only navigable river, River [[Emajõgi]] (100&nbsp;km long), flows through the county, connecting Lake Peipus and Lake Võrtsjärv. Wavy plains are typical landscapes of Tartu County. One third of the county is covered with forests, a third is cultivated. A quarter is made up of wetlands at the headwaters and lower course of the Emajõgi. In the northern part of the county, there are [[drumlin]] fields with lakes between them. Nature reserves, such as [[Pähklisaar Nature Reserve]], [[Emajõe Suursoo]] and [[Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve|Alam-Pedja]] take up about 10% of the county's territory.

== History ==
Archaeological findings suggest that people first inhabited the territory of the current Tartu County about 5000 years ago. City of Tartu was first mentioned in historical records in 1030, when [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] organized a military campaign against [[Chud]]s, defeated them and established fort Yuryev in what is modern day Tartu.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tvauri|first1=Andres|title=The Migration Period, Pre-Viking Age, and Viking Age in Estonia|date=2012|pages=33, 59, 60|url=https://www.etis.ee/Portal/Publications/Display/b80b6f11-43ed-4b8c-b616-48ac53b70ec5?language=ENG|access-date=27 December 2016}}</ref> In 1224, after the conquest of the stronghold by the German invaders, Tartu became the capital of a diocese, stretching from Northern Estonia to [[Latvia]]. Since the 13th century, Tartu belonged to the [[Hanseatic League]], and the town became a well-known trade centre in the [[Baltic Sea]] region. In 1569, together with [[Duchy of Livonia]], Tartu became part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In 1598 Tartu became capital of the [[Dorpat Voivodeship]], which remained part of the PLC until the 1620s, when the city was conquered by the Swedes.

King [[Gustavus Adolphus]] of [[Sweden]] established the [[University of Tartu]] in 1632. Estonia's first teachers' training school was established in Tartu County in 1684, as well as the first Estonian schools for the children of peasants. Closed during and after the [[Great Northern War]], Tartu University was re-opened in 1802 as the only university operating in [[German language]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. Economic development of the region was further encouraged by the construction of the railway connecting Tartu with Tallinn, [[Riga]] and [[St. Petersburg]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the national awakening of Estonians began from Tartu region. After Estonia gained independence in 1918, Tartu, along with Tallinn, became one of the two main cultural centres of Estonia, where most of the Estonian intelligentsia of the time lived and worked. In 1987–1989, the students' environmental and cultural heritage movement in Tartu initiated Estonia's [[Singing Revolution]] and restoration of the country's independence.

==Economy==

The biggest [[private sector]] employer is Tarmeko, producing furniture and components, with 900 employees. [[Unemployment]] rate in the county has been 2–3% in the recent years.

The main export target countries are [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Latvia]] and [[Russia]]. 40% of the exports is wood and furniture, other export production includes machinery and appliances, building materials, glass and clothing. Thanks to the fertile lands, there are many big agricultural enterprises in the West of the county. Fishery is an important activity on the coast of [[Lake Peipus]].

There is development potential for knowledge intensive production in the region due to its universities. Some successful spin-offs of [[Tartu University]] are operating in the field of [[biotechnology]] and biomedicine. Since 2004, several [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] companies, orientated on the international markets, have been growing fast.

In order to facilitate [[innovation]] and [[technology]] transfer, [[Tartu Science Park]] is offering incubation and consultation services to research-based and high-tech oriented companies, and promoting cooperation between research institutions.
