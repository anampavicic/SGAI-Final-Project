'''Quảng Ngãi''' is a northern coastal [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[South Central Coast]] region, the [[Central Vietnam|Central]] of [[Vietnam]]. It borders [[Quảng Nam]] to the north, [[Bình Định]] to the south, [[Kon Tum province|Kon Tum]] to the west, [[Gia Lai]] to the southwest and the [[South China Sea|East Sea]] to the east.

Quảng Ngãi is located {{convert|883|km}} south of [[Hanoi]] and {{convert|838|km}} north of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Hồ Chí Minh City]]. The province has been historically populated with [[H're people]] and ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Kinh]], and located on the coast.

==History==
[[File:Province de Quang-Ngai (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Quang Ngai province in 1909]]
The ancient [[Sa Huỳnh culture]] inhabited what is now Quảng Ngãi. Remains of it were found in Sa Huỳnh, [[Đức Phổ District]]. Within Champa, the region that is now Quảng Ngãi was less significant than [[Quảng Nam province]] and [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]]. There are only a few Cham remains in the province.<ref>Hardy, Andrew, Nguyen Van Ku & Ngo Van Doanh (2005): Peregrinations into Cham Culture, Hanoi: Thế Giới Publishers</ref> The area became part of Vietnam along with [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] ([[Bình Định province]]) in 1471. In the early 19th century the [[Long Wall of Quảng Ngãi]] was constructed in the province. It improved security among the Vietnamese and [[H're people]] and facilitated trade.<ref name="Bray2">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110420-scale-the-great-wall-of-vietnam|title=Scale the Great Wall of Vietnam|last=Bray|first=Adam|date=22 April 2011|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=25 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425034917/http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110420-scale-the-great-wall-of-vietnam|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 April 2011}}</ref> The province had become a center for religious activity, in particular with the construction of a mountain-top monastery, the Thien An Mountain Pagoda in 1695. [https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/places/300-year-old-pagoda-a-spiritual-beacon-in-central-vietnam-4047132.html] The mountain was designated by the ruler [[Nguyễn Phúc Chu]] and became a religious pilgrimage site.

Quảng Ngãi province was one of the first provinces in central Vietnam (together with [[Quảng Trị Province|Quảng Trị]]) to organize self-defense units in March 1945. The [[Ba Tơ District|Ba Tơ]] Guerrilla Unit mobilized tens of thousands of peasants.<ref>Lockhart, Greg (1989). ''Nation in Arms - The Origins of the People's Army of Vietnam'', Sydney: Asian Studies Association of Australia in association with Allen & Unwin, pp. 119, 139-140</ref> It was known as a [[Việt Cộng]] stronghold during the [[Vietnam War]] and was the site of the purported [[Bình Hòa massacre]] and the [[My Lai Massacre]]. The province produced famous war literature on both sides of the conflict including the wartime diary of Viet Cong medic [[Đặng Thùy Trâm]] was written here, and from the US perspective, the setting of [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Things They Carried]]''.

After reunification, the province was designated as the center of a planned oil industry notably the [[Dung Quất Refinery]] alongside special economic zones for the development of heavy and light industries.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dung Quat in Quang Ngam, Vietnam - for factory relocation|url=http://www.business-in-asia.com/dung_quat_guang_ngai_vietnam.html|access-date=2020-11-28|website=www.business-in-asia.com}}</ref>

== Economy ==
The economy of the province has historically relied on agriculture and fishing, but in recent years has seen significant industrialization with special trade rules applying. The economy of Quang Ngai and surrounding regions is designated for the development of heavy industries, in particular, trade-oriented export and special economic rules apply to parts of the province. The Dung Quat Economic Zone located within the province has a separate visa regime for foreigners seeking to work within the country.<ref>{{Cite web|last=VnExpress|title=Economic zone seeks work visas for foreign experts - VnExpress International|url=https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/economy/economic-zone-seeks-work-visas-for-foreign-experts-4089662.html|access-date=2020-11-28|website=VnExpress International – Latest news, business, travel and analysis from Vietnam|language=en}}</ref>  Industrial output within the province has seen growth rates of 15-20% annually, far outstripping most other regions in central Vietnam.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Quang Ngai pushes industrial progress|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/253447/quang-ngai-pushes-industrial-progress.html|access-date=2020-11-28|website=vietnamnews.vn|language=en}}</ref>

The Dung Quat economic zone is recognized as one of five key coastal sites for economic growth in Vietnam, and has seen significant Japanese [[foreign direct investment]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Quang Ngai to receive $117 million investment|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/271441/quang-ngai-to-receive-117-million-investment.html|access-date=2020-11-28|website=vietnamnews.vn|language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
Quảng Ngãi's topography is dominated by a large plain along the coast and in the center of the province and by mountains  and hills in the west and along its borders with  [[Quảng Nam Province|Quảng Nam]] and [[Bình Định Province|Bình Định]] provinces. Lowlands extend further inland along [[Trà Khúc River]].<ref name=Atlat>''Atlat Dia li Viet Nam'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref> The province's highest peak is at 1630m in the west of the province near the border to Quảng Nam.<ref name="atlas10">Viet Nam Administrative Atlas. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref> The coastline is relatively straight in most of the south and central part of the province (unusual for the [[South Central Coast]]), but features several capes north of Quảng Ngãi City.<ref name=Atlat/> The province's largest river is the Trà Khúc. Other important rivers are the [[Trà Bồng River|Trà Bồng]] in the north and the Ve River in the south of the province. The [[Lý Sơn]] islands belong to Quảng Ngãi. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Demography==
The province had a population of 1,219,200 in 2009.<ref name="BDSO09"/> Around 40% is concentrated in Quảng Ngãi City and the two districts just north and south of it ([[Sơn Tịnh District|Sơn Tịnh]] and [[Tư Nghĩa District|Tư Nghĩa]]), where population density ranges from over 500 to 3600/km<sup>2</sup>). Population density in most of coastal Quảng Ngãi is around 400/km<sup>2</sup>. The five western districts have population densities of less than 100/km<sup>2</sup>, three of them ([[Tây Trà District|Tây Trà]], [[Sơn Tây District, Quảng Ngãi|Sơn Tây]], and [[Ba Tơ District|Ba Tơ]]) even less than 50/km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="atlas10"/> Quảng Ngãi is the least urbanized province of the [[Nam Trung Bộ|South Central Coast]], with only 14.4% of the population living in cities and towns.<ref name="GSO09calc"/> The population grew by an annual average of 1% between 2000 and 2007, while the growth of the urban population was 3.9% on average, one of the highest rates in the region.<ref name="GSO09calc"/>

The coastal lowlands are mostly ethnically homogeneous, with almost the entire population (>99%) made up of [[Kinh]] people. There are large [[H're people|Hrê]] communities in the southwest of the province. They made up the majority of the population in the districts of [[Ba Tơ District|Ba Tơ]], [[Sơn Hà District|Sơn Hà]] (which then also included [[Sơn Tây District, Quảng Ngãi|Sơn Tây]]), and [[Minh Long District|Minh Long]] as of 1996.<ref name=minority>General Statistics Office (1996): Population Data of Sparsely Populated Areas in Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> A slight majority in [[Trà Bồng District]] (which then also included the [[Tây Trà District]]) were [[Cor people|Co people]].<ref name=minority/> There is also a small minority of [[Xo Dang people|Xơ Đăng]] in [[Sơn Hà District]].<ref name=minority/>

==Administrative divisions==
Quảng Ngãi is subdivided into 12 district-level sub-divisions:

* 11 districts:
{{div col}}
** [[Ba Tơ district|Ba Tơ]]
** [[Bình Sơn district|Bình Sơn]]
** [[Minh Long district|Minh Long]]
** [[Mộ Đức district|Mộ Đức]]
** [[Nghĩa Hành district|Nghĩa Hành]]
** [[Sơn Hà district|Sơn Hà]]
** [[Sơn Tây district, Quảng Ngãi|Sơn Tây]]
** [[Sơn Tịnh district|Sơn Tịnh]]
** [[Trà Bồng district|Trà Bồng]]
** [[Tư Nghĩa district|Tư Nghĩa]]
** [[Lý Sơn district|Lý Sơn]] (island district)
{{div col end}}
* 1 district-level town:
** [[Đức Phổ district|Đức Phổ]]
* 1 provincial city:
** [[Quảng Ngãi]] (capital)

They are further subdivided into nine commune-level towns (or townlets), 166 communes, and nine wards.

==Economy==
Quảng Ngãi's GDP per capita was 7.82 million [[VND]] in 2007, making it the second poorest province in the [[South Central Coast]] (after [[Ninh Thuận Province|Ninh Thuận]]), due to weaknesses in all major sectors of the economy (agriculture, industry, services).<ref name=GSO09calc>calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> However, Quảng Ngãi's economy has been booming since then, due to a spectacular increase in industrial GDP from the Dung Quat Economic Zone. It grew by 21% in 2009, increasing GDP per capita to 15.2 million VND, higher than that of its neighbours, [[Quảng Nam Province|Quảng Nam]] and [[Bình Định Province|Bình Định]] provinces.<ref name="BDSO09">Bình Định Statistics Office (2010): ''Bình Định Statistical Yearbook 2009''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Exports increased from 31 million US$ in 2005 to 182 million in 2009.<ref name="BDSO09"/>

The number of employed people increased from 571,400 in 2000 to 704,700, despite a significant decline agricultural and fishing employment. The booming industrial sector created 63,200 jobs in the period and employs 99,200 as of 2007. Despite lacking behind the industrial sector in terms of value-added, the service sector employed 180,500 people in 2007 compared to 57,900 in 2000.<ref name="BDSO09"/>

===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===
[[File:Quang Ngai farmer.jpg|thumb|right|Farmer in Quảng Ngãi province]]
Despite its large agricultural area, Quảng Ngãi's agricultural GDP is low compared to other provinces in the region. Rice cultivation takes up the largest area, concentrated around Quảng Ngãi City.<ref name=Atlat/> 381,200t of rice were harvested in 2007.<ref name="GSO09">General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities, Vietnam''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Other important crops include sugar-cane, peanuts, and coconuts. There is a large number of cattle in the province (287,800 in 2007),<ref name="GSO09"/> mostly in the northwest and southwest.<ref name=Atlat/>

Quảng Ngãi's fishing output as share of total national output is larger than its population share  . [[Lý Sơn]] island plays an important role as an offshore fishing center. It contributed almost one fourth to the total of 126,000 tonnes of fish caught in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fine weather brings bumper fishing haul|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/Agriculture/234796/fine-weather-brings-bumper-fishing-haul.html|access-date=5 January 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=3 January 2013}}</ref> However, in contrast to the rest of the region, there is a lack of rich fishing grounds off the coast of Quảng Ngãi province.<ref name=Atlat/>

===Industry===
Quảng Ngãi City is a secondary industrial center of the South Central Coast with processing of agricultural products and production of some paper and machinery.<ref name=Atlat/> Other products include beer (38.3 million litres in 2007), textiles (5,577 pieces), bricks (303 million), chemical fertilizer (24kt), and hand farming tools (352,000 pieces). Furniture is produced in Quảng Ngãi as a major export product, accounting for 11.475 million US$ in 2007.<ref name="GSO09"/>

Industrial GDP has more than tripled between 2000 and 2007, growing by an average yearly rate of 18.64%.<ref name="GSO09calc"/> This was the second highest growth rate in the South Central Coast after [[Bình Thuận province]]. Industry has grown even faster since then, due in large part to the Dung Quat Economic Zone. The [[Dung Quất Refinery]], Vietnam's first oil refinery, started production in February 2009. In the same year, industrial [[gross output]] increased by 144.7% and the share of industry in the province's GDP surged from 36.2% in 2008 to 46.3% in 2009.<ref name="BDSO09"/> This share is higher than that of other provinces in the region and even slightly higher than that of [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng]]. The province's prospects for industry may also be changing outside Dung Quat Economic Zone. [[Vinatex]] bought [[Đại Cát Tường]], a formerly bankrupt textile manufacturer, in 2011 and plans to expand its production in Quảng Ngãi significantly.<ref name=VT>{{Cite news|title=Vinatex mua lại công ty thua lỗ ở Quảng Ngãi|publisher=The Saigon Times|url=http://www.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/doanhnghiep/motvongdoanhnghiep/56565|date=2011-07-05|access-date=2011-07-06}}</ref>

Quảng Ngãi's industry was dominated by the state sector (mostly centrally managed companies) until 2005, after which most of the state industry was (officially) privatized. The state sector's share decreased from 2/3 in 2000 to around 1/8 in 2007, while there was also a restructuring within the state sector from central state to locally managed state enterprises.<ref name="GSO09"/>

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
[[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]] and the [[North–South railway (Vietnam)|North–South railway]] run through the province. The main railway station is the [[Quảng Ngãi railway station]]. National Road 24 connects Quảng Ngãi to [[Kon Tum]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. It has its starting point at Thach Tru on National Route 1 28&nbsp;km south of Quảng Ngãi City and passes through [[Ba Tơ district]].<ref name="Road Atlas 2004">''Vietnam Road Atlas'' (Tập Bản đồ Giao thông Đường bộ Việt Nam). Cartographic Publishing House (Vietnam), 2004</ref> The nearest airport is [[Chu Lai International Airport]], just north of Quảng Ngãi province. The province has a major port in the Dung Quat Economic Zone, namely Dung Quat Port, in the north of the province. Sa Ky is a local port north of Quảng Ngãi City. It serves as a fishing and small cargo port and has regular ferry connections to [[Lý Sơn]] island.

===Energy===
There is a hydroelectric station on [[Trà Khúc River]] in the center of the province. It is located near the border of [[Sơn Hà district]] with [[Tư Nghĩa district]] and [[Sơn Tịnh district]].<ref name="atlas10"/> As of 2007, 401 million kwh were generated in the province.<ref name="GSO09"/>

==Tourism==
[[Long Wall of Quảng Ngãi]] was discovered in 2005.

==Disease outbreak==
In April 2012, there have been multiple reports of an outbreak of an unknown fatal disease in the area around [[Ba Tơ]]. See [[Quảng Ngãi skin disease outbreak]] for more details.
