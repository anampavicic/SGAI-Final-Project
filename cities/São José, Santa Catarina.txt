'''São José''' is a city in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Brazil]]. It is approximately 5&nbsp;km from and encircles the continental section of [[Florianópolis]].

The municipality of São José, located in Grande Florianópolis, is the fourth oldest in Santa Catarina and was colonized on October 26, 1750, by 182 Azorean couples, from the islands of Pico, Terceira, São Jorge, Faial, Graciosa and São Miguel. In 1829, it received the first nucleus of German colonization of the State.
Rapid development, coupled with population growth and economic power, meant that, on March 1, 1833, through the Resolution of the President of the Province, Feliciano Nunes Pires, São José passed from parish to village (municipality) and, in May 1856, through Provincial Law No. 415, was elevated to the city.
Not being very touristy in nature, unlike Florianópolis, São José has attracted industries such as [[telecommunication]] equipment, [[textile]]s, and [[food processing]].

The main district of São José are Kobrasol and the Historic Centre.

São José is ranked 21st on the [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in Brazil.

The major [[Brazilian Highway System|BR-101 highway]] passes through São José, making the city a gateway to Florianópolis.
