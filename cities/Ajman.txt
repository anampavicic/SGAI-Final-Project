'''Ajman''' ({{langx|ar|عجمان}} ''{{transl|ar|'Aǧmān}}''; [[Gulf Arabic]]: عيمان ''ʿYmān'') is the capital of the [[emirate of Ajman]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It is the [[List of cities in the United Arab Emirates|fifth-largest city]] in UAE after [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Sharjah]] and [[Al Ain]]. Located along the [[Persian Gulf]], it is engulfed by the larger emirate of Sharjah in territory.

== Etymology ==
The word Ajman comes from [[Arabic]] {{Lang|ar|عَجْمان}} (ʕajmān), related to عَجَم (ʕajam, “foreigner”), because the area was at one time inhabited by [[Persians]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Gwillim Law |title=Administrative Subdivisions of Countries |publisher=McFarland |orig-year=1999 |isbn=9780786460977 |edition=ebook |page=382|language=en |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXCeCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA382 |year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=William Lancaster |author2= Fidelity Lancaster |title=Honour is in Contentment |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2011 |isbn=9783110223392 |page=513 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Le0Ryxzh7cQC&pg=PA513}}</ref>

== History ==
Al Bu Kharaiban [[Al Nuaimi|Nuaimi]] rule in Ajman started in 1816, when Sheikh [[Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi]] and fifty of his followers took the coastal settlement of Ajman from members of the [[Al Bu Shamis]] Nuaimi tribe in a short conflict.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rashid: Portrait of a Ruler|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=2010|isbn=9789948152880|location=UK|pages=21}}</ref> It wasn't until 1816 or 1817, however, that the Ajman fort finally fell to Rashid's followers and his rule was endorsed by the powerful Sheikh of neighbouring [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] and [[Ras Al Khaimah]], [[Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rashid, portrait of a ruler|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|year=2010|isbn=9789948152880|location=London|publisher=Media Prima|pages=21|oclc=843954755}}</ref>

On 8 January 1820, following the sack of Ras Al Khaimah by a British force led by Sir W.G. Keir, Sultan bin Saqr signed the General Maritime Treaty with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] on 4 February 1820, followed on 15 March by Rashid bin Humaid<ref>[[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|General Maritime Treaty, 1820]]</ref> at Falaya Fort.

An 1822 British maritime survey noted that Ajman had one of the best [[wiktionary:backwater|backwaters]] on the coast and was a small town with a single fortified building, the ruler's house. In common with many other coastal towns on what became the [[Trucial States|Trucial Coast]], the population was mobile depending on the season – there were as many as 1,400 to 1,700 men of the 'Mahamee' tribe living there during the [[pearl hunting]] season (April–September), many of whom would migrate to [[Al Buraimi]] in the [[Date palm|date]] season. The survey notes that Ajman's ruler Rashid bin Ahmed considered his dominion independent of the Emirate of Sharjah, but that Sharjah did not maintain that view even though it had no power over Ajman.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islands and Maritime Boundaries of the Gulf 1798–1960|last=Schofield|first=R|publisher=Archive Editions|year=1990|isbn=9781852072759|location=UK|pages=543}}</ref> The survey noted that the inhabitants of Ajman were 'mostly strict [[Wahhabi]]s' and recorded the presence of the ruined village of ''Fasht'' down the shore from Ajman town, which is today the Fisht suburb of [[Sharjah city]].

In 1831, the Sheikh of Ajman accepted a subsidy from the Imam of [[Muscat]] to join with Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah against [[Sohar]], but following Sultan's defeat declared for Sohar.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} In his absence, a part of [[Bani Yas]] from [[Abu Dhabi]] sacked Ajman town and its date groves.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Islands and Maritime Boundaries of the Gulf 1798–1960|last=Schofield|first=R|publisher=Archive Editions|year=1990|isbn=9781852072759|location=UK|pages=133}}</ref> In retaliation, the forces of Ajman committed 'daring depredations' upon the cities of Sohar and Muscat. When called upon to provide redress for the actions of his 'subject', Sultan bin Saqr disavowed any authority over Ajman and in 1832 a British naval force was sent to Ajman to obtain redress for the raids on the East Coast cities.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Islands and Maritime Boundaries of the Gulf 1798–1960|last=Schofield|first=R|publisher=Archive Editions|year=1990|isbn=9781852072759|location=UK|pages=134–135}}</ref> Ending a conflict between Sharjah, Ajman and Dubai on the one hand and Abu Dhabi on the other, Ajman (together with the other parties) signed the 1835 Maritime Treaty in its own right.<ref name=":1" />

In 1840, Humaid bin Obeid bin Subt of [[Al Heera]] invaded Ajman supported by a body of the Bani Naeem. Although initially reluctant to assist Humeid bin Rashid, Sultan bin Suggur of Sharjah sent his son Suggur who, together with Maktoum of Dubai, ejected the invaders and sacked Al Heera in reprisal.

In 1843 a further Maritime Treaty was signed between the Trucial Sheikhs and the British and then, on 4 May 1853, 'A Perpetual Treaty of Peace' was entered into by the coastal Sheikhs, including Ajman. A copy of this treaty is on display in Ajman Museum. A further treaty of 1892 bound the Trucial States to Britain.

By the 20th century, [[John Gordon Lorimer (civil servant)|J. G. Lorimer]]'s survey of the coast of the Trucial States showed Ajman to be a small town of some 750 inhabitants (in comparison, the population of Dubai at the time numbered over 10,000).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Oman & Central Arabia|last=Lorimer|first=John G|publisher=Government of India|year=1908|location=Bombay|pages=1433–1451}}</ref> On 2 December 1971, Ajman, under Sheikh Rashid bin Humayd Al Nuaimi, joined the United Arab Emirates.

==Population==
The city has more than 90% of the population of the emirate. The area runs directly into the city of [[Sharjah]] along the coast to the southwest, which in turn is adjacent to [[Dubai]], forming a [[Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area|continuous urban area]]. Ajman's population in 2024 is estimated at 417,695, reflecting a significant growth trajectory over the decades. Back in 1950, the population was only 231, highlighting the rapid urbanization and development of the emirate. In the past year, Ajman has seen an increase of 6,298 people, which translates to a 1.53% annual growth rate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ajman, United Arab Emirates Population 2024 |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/united-arab-emirates/ajman |access-date=2024-10-09 |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref>

==Commercial==
Ajman is home to the Ruler's office, companies, commercial markets, and about 50 international and local [[retail]] shops. [[Bank]]ing interests include: [[Emirates NBD]], [[Ajman Bank]], Arab Bank PLC, [[Bank Saderat Iran]], and [[Commercial Bank of Dubai]]. Ajman is also home to fishing industry & Seafood Importers/Exporters in UAE. Shopping malls include Ajman China Mall and [[City Centre Ajman]].
