'''Yangon Region'''<ref name="md" /> ({{MYname|MY= ရန်ကုန်တိုင်းဒေသကြီး|MLCTS= rankun tuing desa. kri:}}, {{IPA-my|jàɰ̃ɡòʊɰ̃ táɪɰ̃ dèθa̰ dʑí|pron}}; formerly '''Rangoon Division''' and '''Yangon Division''') is an administrative region of [[Myanmar]]. Located in central Myanmar, the region is bordered by Bago Region to the north and east, the [[Gulf of Martaban]] to the south, and [[Ayeyarwady Region]] to the west. Yangon Region is dominated by its capital city of [[Yangon]], the former national capital and the largest city in the country. Other important cities are [[Thanlyin]] and [[Twante]]. The division is the most developed region of the country and the main international gateway. The division measures  {{convert|10,170|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=br>{{cite web | url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/yangon-division-ema-06/ | title=Yangon Division | access-date=2008-12-25 | publisher=Bookrags.com}}</ref>

==History==
The region was historically populated by the [[Mon people|Mon]]. Politically, the area was controlled by [[Mon kingdoms]] prior to 1057, and after 1057, with few exceptions, by [[Bamar people|Burman]] kingdoms from the north. The control of the region reverted to [[Bago, Myanmar|Pegu]]-based Mon kingdoms in the 13th to 16th centuries (1287&ndash;1539) and briefly in the 18th century (1740–57). The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] were in control of Thanlyin (Syriam) and the surrounding area from 1599 to 1613.<ref name=mha>{{cite book|title=A History of Burma|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofburma00htin|url-access=registration|author=Maung Htin Aung|year=1967|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York and London}}</ref>

For centuries, Thanlyin was the most important port city in Lower Myanmar until the mid-18th century when King [[Alaungpaya]] chose to enlarge a small village across the river near the great [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] named Dagon.<ref name=mn>{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-yangon/yangon.htm#History_of_Yangon|title=History of Yangon|access-date=25 December 2008|publisher=Myanmar's Net}}</ref>

The [[British Empire|British]] first captured Yangon in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–26) but returned it to Burmese administration after the war. The British seized Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon into the commercial and political hub of British Burma. Yangon was the capital of [[British Burma]] and Hanthawaddy Province, which covered today's Yangon and Bago divisions. The British brought in many [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] to serve as workers and civil servants. By the 1930s, the Indians made up half of Yangon city, and only one-third was  [[Myanmar|Burmese]].

Between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], Yangon was the center of the Burmese nationalist movement. Many future Burmese political figures such as [[Aung San]], [[U Nu]], [[U Thant]] and [[Ne Win]] were all one-time Rangoon University students.<ref name=tmu>{{cite book|title=The River of Lost Footsteps, Histories of Burma|author=Thant Myint-U|year=2006|isbn=978-0-374-16342-6|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|place=New York}}</ref> Yangon Region was under [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] occupation between April 1942 and May 1945.

After Myanmar gained independence from the United Kingdom in January 1948, the Hanthawaddy Province was renamed Pegu (Bago) Division, with Yangon as its capital. In 1964, Rangoon Division was split from Pegu Division. The capital of Pegu Division was changed from Rangoon to [[Bago, Myanmar|Pegu]]. In June 1974, Hanthawaddy (Hongsavatoi) and [[Hmawbi Township|Hmawbi]] townships were transferred from Pegu Division to Rangoon Division.<ref name=md>{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/umm.html|title=Myanmar Divisions|access-date=10 April 2009|publisher=Statoids}}</ref>

Post-war Yangon grew tremendously. Successive Burmese governments built satellite towns near Yangon. Today, Yangon Region is essentially the Greater Yangon metropolitan area surrounded by a hollow rural hinterland.

==Administrative divisions==
There were only four districts in Yangon Region.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs6/MIMU001_A3_SD%20&%20Township%20Overview.pdf | title=Myanmar States/Divisions and Townships | publisher=Myanmar Information Management Unit | date=December 2007}}</ref> On 30 April 2022, these districts were expanded to 14 districts by the provisional government. Of the 45, the city of Yangon now encompasses 33 townships.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.myanmaritv.com/news/expansion-new-districts-new-districts-expanded-nay-pyi-taw-regions-and-states| title=EXPANSION OF NEW DISTRICTS: NEW DISTRICTS EXPANDED IN NAY PYI TAW, REGIONS AND STATES}}</ref><ref name=gad>{{cite web|url=https://www.ycdc.gov.mm/mobile_pages.php?pagename=Townships|title=District Maps in Yangon City Development Committee Boundary}}</ref><ref name=new>{{cite web|url=https://news-eleven.com/article/229873|title=နေပြည်တော်၊ တိုင်းဒေသကြီးနှင့် ပြည်နယ်များတွင် ခရိုင် ၄၆ ခရိုင် အသစ်တိုးချဲ့ဖွဲ့စည်းသည့်အတွက် စုစုပေါင်းခရိုင် ၁၂၁ ခရိုင်ရှိလာ}}</ref>

==Economy==

Yangon Region is the most developed region in the country. According to the government's official statistics for FY 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93 trillion kyat, or 23% of the [[Gross domestic product|national GDP]].<ref name=mt->{{cite journal | title=Yangon Region govt facing K22b budget black hole | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/600/news60002.html | author=Kyaw Hsu Mon and Yadana Htun | date=2011-11-07 | journal=The Myanmar Times}}</ref> Greater Yangon is Lower Myanmar's main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic food stuffs to used cars. [[Bayinnaung Market]] is the largest wholesale center in the country for [[rice]], [[beans]] and [[pulses]], and other [[agricultural]] [[commodities]]. Much of the country's legal imports and exports go through Thanlyin's [[Thilawa port]], the largest and busiest port in Myanmar. At least 14 light [[industrial park|industrial zones]] ring Yangon,<ref name=iz>{{cite web | url=http://www.industry2.gov.mm/zone.htm | title=Industrial Zones | access-date=2008-12-25 | publisher=Ministry of Industry 2, Myanmar}}</ref> employing thousands of workers. Outside Greater Yangon, rice farming remains predominant. Other important crops include jute, pulses, rubber, sugarcane, and groundnut.<ref name=br/>

==Transport==
{{See also|Yangon#Transport|category=Default: yes}}

Yangon Region has the best transportation infrastructure in the country. All transport to and from the rest of the country (and the world) goes through Yangon. Five "highways" link Yangon to the rest of the country.<ref name="ngamoeyeik">{{cite news | url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/2-2001/nga.htm | title=Ngamoeyeik Bridge | author=Kyi Kyi Hla | date=2001-02-01}}</ref> (To be sure, the definition of highway is loosely used. Most highways are no more than two lane roads.) [[Yangon International Airport]] is the main international gateway of the country. [[Yangon Central Railway Station]] is a major hub of the {{convert|5068|km|mi|0|adj=on}} [[Myanmar Railways]] system. [[Twante Canal]], which links Yangon to Ayeyarwady Region, is also widely used for both transport and commerce.

As motor transportation is highly expensive for most people, buses are the main mode of transportation within the division or regions nearby. In January 2008, Yangon Region had nearly 182,000 motor vehicles, 17.7% of the country's total.<ref name=uncrd>{{cite web | url=http://www.uncrd.or.jp/env/3rd-regional-est-forum/doc/23_Myanmar.pdf | title=Third Regional EST Forum: Presentation of Myanmar | publisher=Ministry of Transport, Myanmar | location=Singapore | date=17–19 March 2008}}</ref>

Although the city of Yangon has the best education facilities in the country, the educational facilities and opportunities available in the rest of Yangon Region are extremely poor.

Nearly all of the division's universities are in Greater Yangon. [[Dagon University]] in [[North Dagon Township|North Dagon]] and the [[University of East Yangon]] in Thanlyin are among the largest undergraduate universities in the country. Yangon's [[University of Medicine 1, Yangon]], [[University of Medicine 2, Yangon]], [[Yangon Technological University]], [[University of Computer Studies, Yangon]] and Thanlyin's [[Myanmar Maritime University]] are among the most selective universities in Myanmar.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu08/e001.htm | title=HR key to development | date=2008-03-28 | author=Minh Zaw | newspaper=The Myanmar Times}}</ref>

==Health care==
{{See also|List of hospitals in Yangon|Yangon General Hospital|}}

The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 | title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States | date=2007-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml  | title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases | date=2007-06-28 | author=Yasmin Anwar | publisher=UC Berkeley News}}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals.
