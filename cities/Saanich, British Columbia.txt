'''Saanich''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|n|ɪ|tʃ}} {{respell|SAN|itch}}) is a [[district municipality]] on the southern end of [[Vancouver Island]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada, within the [[Greater Victoria]] area. The population was 117,735 at the [[Canada 2021 Census|2021 census]], making it the most populous municipality in the [[Capital Regional District]] and [[Vancouver Island]], and the eighth-most populous in the province.<ref name="Census2021"/> With an area of {{convert|103.44|km2|sqmi}}, Saanich is also the largest municipality in Greater Victoria. The district adopted its name after the [[Saanich people|Saanich]] [[First Nations in Canada|First Nation]], meaning "emerging land" or "emerging people".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstvoices.ca/scripts/WebObjects.exe/FirstVoices.woa/3/wa/enterLanguageArchive?archive=3c39bcf779c644e3&wosid=WZ91RL9KfCr5EAIGt5ucig|title=SENĆOŦEN Community Portal|first=John|last=Elliott|website=www.firstvoices.ca|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

Saanich contains a mix of urban, suburban, and rural areas stretching north to the [[Saanich Peninsula]] with a wide variety of features including ocean coastlines, freshwater lakes, small rivers, small mountains, rainforests, and agriculture ranging from hay to vineyards.The municipality's topography is undulating with many glacially scoured rock outcroppings. Elevations range from sea level to {{convert|229|m|ft}}. There are {{convert|8.1749|km2|sqmi}} of freshwater lakes and {{convert|29.61|km|mi}} of marine shoreline.

Saanich is also home to the northern half of the [[University of Victoria]] (with the neighbouring district municipality of [[Oak Bay]] home to the southern half), both campuses of [[Camosun College]], and the Vancouver Island Technology Park.

==History==
Saanich has been the home to [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] people for thousands of years. Saanich is on the territory of the Lək̓ʷəŋən peoples known today as [[Songhees]] & [[Esquimalt_First_Nation|Esquimalt]] Nations, the [[Malahat_First_Nation|Malahat Nation]] and the [[Saanich_people|Saanich Peoples]].<ref name="SMIR">{{cite web|title=Indigenous Relations|url=https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/Indigenous-Relations.html|website=Saanich|publisher=District of Saanich|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210621191144/https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/Indigenous-Relations.html|access-date=June 21, 2021|archive-date=June 21, 2021}}</ref> These Indigenous peoples have connections to the land and those traditions are carried on to this day. Non-Indigenous history begins with the arrival of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in the 1840s.

The [[Craigflower Schoolhouse]] (originally called Maple Point School), the oldest surviving school building in Western Canada, was built on orders from Kenneth MacKenzie. He came from [[Scotland]] with his family in 1852, on the Hudson's Bay Company ship, ''Norman Morison'', to establish a farm for the [[Puget Sound Agricultural Company]], a subsidiary of the Hudson's Bay Company. A school was needed for the children of farm employees, as well as those of arriving settlers. 

The Municipality of Saanich was incorporated on March 1, 1906. The [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]] telescope was designed by [[John Stanley Plaskett]], an astronomer with the Department of the Interior in [[Ottawa]]. The {{convert|72|in|cm|order=flip|adj=on}} reflecting telescope was the largest of its kind in the world when it was built, though this was only the case for a few short months in 1918. The District of Saanich contains a long shoreline with sandy beaches located at several ocean bays. Two of the beaches are [[Cadboro Bay]] Beach and Cordova Bay Beach. Cadboro Bay is known as the home of the "[[Cadborosaurus]]", a mythical [[cryptid]]. Saanich's notable parks include PKOLS (Mount Douglas Park), Mount Tolmie Park (with viewpoints), and Cadboro-Gyro Park.{{cn|date=January 2024}}
