== Etymology ==
In [[Sanskrit]] documents, Guntur was referred to as ''Garthapuri''; in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], "Guntlapuri" means "a place surrounded by water ponds".<ref name="district profile">{{Cite web|title=District Profile|url=http://guntur.cdma.ap.gov.in/en/district-profile|website=Guntur Municipal Corporation|access-date=6 June 2017|archive-date=14 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514110956/http://guntur.cdma.ap.gov.in/en/district-profile|url-status=dead}}</ref> The settlement might have been near a pond (Telugu: "gunta"); hence "gunta uru" means "pond village". Another source refers to "kunta", a land-measuring unit, which may have transformed to "kunta uru" and later to "Guntur".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Pullaiah|first1=T.|title=Flora of Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, India|date=2000|publisher=Regency Publications|isbn=9788187498162|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kHNgLyXbJUC&q=guntur+revenue+division+headquarters&pg=PA2|access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

The region was historically known for [[Buddhism]]; the first [[Kalachakra]] ceremony was performed by [[Gautama Buddha]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalacakra.org/history/khistor2.htm|title=Kālacakra history|work=kalacakra.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211023333/http://www.kalacakra.org/history/khistor2.htm|archive-date=11 February 2021}}</ref> Agastyeshwara temple is one of the oldest temples in the city; according to a local legend, [[Agastya]] built it in the [[Treta Yuga]] around a ''[[swayambhu]] [[Lingam|linga]]''. Inscriptions on the side of Naga Muchalinda, a sculpture unearthed in 2018 in the compound of the temple, are in Naga Lipi, an ancient script from the third century [[Common Era|CE]]. Based on this discovery, Emani Sivanagi Reddy, archaeologist and Buddhist scholar believes this region served as a Buddhist site contemporary to [[Nagarjunakonda]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=3rd Century Buddhist sculpture unearthed in Old Guntur |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3rd-century-buddhist-sculpture-unearthed-in-old-guntur/article25786642.ece |date=2018-12-20 |access-date=2024-03-16 |work=[[The Hindu]] |archive-date=29 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230529213422/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3rd-century-buddhist-sculpture-unearthed-in-old-guntur/article25786642.ece |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city rapidly became a major market for agricultural produce from the surrounding countryside due to the opening of the railway link in 1890. The expansion continued post [[Indian independence movement|independence]] as well and was concentrated in what is now called New Guntur, with many urban areas such as [[Brodipet]], [[Arundelpet]] and suburban areas like Pattabhipuram, Chandramoulinagar, Sitaramanagar, and Brindavan Gardens. In 2012, the city limits were expanded with the merger of surrounding ten villages, namely [[Nallapadu]], Pedapalakaluru, Ankireddipalem, Adavitakkellapadu, [[Gorantla, Guntur|Gorantla]], Pothuru, Chowdavaram, Etukuru, [[Budampadu]] and [[Reddypalem, Guntur|Reddypalem]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Merger of gram panchayats in Guntur Municipal Corporation |url=http://www.gunturcorporation.org/townplanning/gos/GO_279_12072012.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126163918/http://gunturcorporation.org/TownPlanning/gos/GO_279_12072012.pdf |archive-date=26 November 2013 |access-date=22 September 2015 |website=Guntur Municipal Corporation |publisher=Municipal Administration & Urban Development Department}}</ref>

Agastheswara Sivalayam, situated in Guntur’s old city, is a temple devoted to Lord Shiva. It holds historical significance with inscriptions in the ancient "Naga Lipi" script, dating back to 1100 AD. The temple is among the most well-known in the region. According to local legends, the sage [[Agastya|Rishi Agastya]] constructed the temple during the [[Treta Yuga]], centered around a naturally occurring Swayambhu Linga, which led to the temple's name.{{sfn|Chandra Rao|2014|p=11}} Constructed in the early 20th century, [[Jinnah Tower]] is a notable monument in Guntur dedicated to [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blog: Finding Kamala Nehru in Pakistan, Jinnah in Guntur |url=https://www.ndtv.com/blog/finding-kamala-nehru-in-pakistan-jinnah-in-guntur-764557 |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=NDTV.com}}</ref> This impressive heritage structure features six pillars and an open dome, showcasing typical architectural styles of Muslim design from that era.
