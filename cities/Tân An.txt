==History==

===Before 1945===
Management of rivers in the Mekong Delta began to develop the area in 1705, bringing commerce to the [[Vàm Cỏ|Vàm Cỏ Tay River]] at Tân An (then written: 新安) as the end of the [[Bảo Định Canal]] in the first years of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] around 1802.<ref>Nadine Reis ''Tracing and Making the State: Policy Practices and Domestic Water ...'' 2012 Page 34 "While the natural floodways in the eastern part of the delta already began to change in 1705 with the construction of the Bao Dinh Canal between the Tien River at My Tho (Tien Giang province) and the Vam Co Tay River at Tan An (Long An province), the middle and western parts of the delta remained largely free from human impact ..."</ref> In 1800, the entire Mekong Delta fell under the Nguyễn dynasty's authority. Tân An and its immediate surroundings used to be its own province, established by the [[French Indochina|French colonists]] in December 1889, when [[Gia Định Province]] was split into four smaller provinces. In October 1956, [[Tân An Province]] was merged into [[Long An Province]] by the [[Republic of Vietnam]] government under President [[Ngô Đình Diệm]].

===1945===
Following the [[August Revolution]] in Hanoi the local communists seized power in the south in Tân An on 21 August 1945.<ref>R. B. B. Smith, Beryl Williams ''Communist Indochina'' 2012 "Having hesitated during a series of secret meetings of an Uprising Committee (formed by Tran Van Giau as early as the 16th), the Communist leadership decided on 21 August to seize power first in the provincial town of Tan An the following ..."</ref>

===Vietnam War===
Tân An was the headquarters of the 3rd Brigade, [[9th Infantry Division (United States)]] during the Vietnam War. The 9th Infantry Division was the southernmost infantry division in the Delta. The 3rd Brigade Headquarters, 9th Division was based in one part of town and Tân An air base was on the other side of town that supported 9th Infantry helicopters and could land medium-sized prop planes. The base camp at Tân An was turned over to the [[South Vietnamese Army]] when the 9th division left in 1970.  The 9th Division was the first infantry division to leave.
