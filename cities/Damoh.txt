==History==
===Early history===
[[Stone Age]] tools have been found in [[Singrampur]] Valley and it is believed that the area has been inhabited for thousands of years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.damoh.nic.in/History.html|title=History {{!}} Damoh - A District of Madhya Pradesh - A City of Grace and Affection|website=www.damoh.nic.in|access-date=29 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116153954/http://www.damoh.nic.in/History.html|archive-date=16 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Around the fifth century, it was part of the empire of [[Guptas]] of [[Pataliputra]]. This has been evidenced by plaques and coins, and monuments from the reigns of [[Samudragupta]], [[Chandragupta I]], and Skandgupta. From the eighth to twelfth centuries, some parts of the Damoh district were in the Chedi Empire, ruled by the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalchuri dynasty]] from its capital Tripuri. The temple at Nohta demonstrates Kalchuri's influence in the tenth century. Some regions of the district were under the Chandels of the Jejak-Bhukti.

===Sultans===
Around the beginning of the fourteenth century, the administrative centre of the [[Chanderi]] province of the [[Khalji dynasty]] was moved to Damoh.

The era of Muslim rule began in the fourteenth century. Stone carvings at Salaiya and Batiyagarh mention [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] and [[Tughlaq Dynasty|Tuglaq]] Sultans. The Sultan of [[Malwa]] later annexed the region.

===Gond and Maratha rule===
In the last quarter of the fifteenth century, Sangram Shah of the [[Gondi people|Gond dynasty]] annexed the region into his empire organised around 52 forts. This was an era of peace and prosperity for the region. In Singrampur, [[Rani Durgawati]] attained martyrdom battling against the [[Mughal Empire]], represented by its General Asaf Khan and his army.

Bundelas entered the region for a brief time span, after which [[Marathas]] took over in 1732. Marathas remained in control until the British annexed the Marathas kingdom after the death of [[Peshwa]] in 1888. The Diwanji ki Talaiya and the Ram Mandir were constructed by the Maratha administrators.

===Modern history===
Raja Hirde Shah, [[Lodhi (caste)|Lodhi]] king of Damoh, played an important part in the Bundela, Gond and Lodhi Uprising of 1842.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bundela Uprising of 1842 |url=https://amritmahotsav.nic.in/district-reopsitory-detail.htm?7299}}</ref>

Damoh took part in the struggle for independence from the British. Under the leadership of [[Thakur Kishore Singh of Hindoria]], Raja Devi Singh of Singrampur, Pancham Singh of Karijog, [[King of mangarh|Gangadhar Rao of Mangarh]], Raghunath Rao, Mejban Singh, and Govind Rao were among those who took part in the [[1857 revolt]].

Damoh suffered from famine in 1896-97 and 1900. By 1899 the India Midland Railway had completed the construction of Sagar–Damoh link and Damoh–Katni links. Freedom fighter [[Seth Govind Das]] was jailed in Damoh in 1923, and wrote a number of Hindi plays while imprisoned. In 1929, [[Acharya Shantisagar]] visited Damoh, the first such visit by a Digambar Muni to Damoh after several centuries.<ref>Charitra Chakravarti, Divakar, Sumeruchandra, 1953, Shanti Prakashan Sivni, p. 257-258</ref>

In 1933, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Damoh. In 1946, [[Sagar University]] was established as the region's primary centre for higher education.

In 1947, with India's independence from [[British Raj]], the [[Central Provinces]] were reorganised as the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The town of Damoh had its first-degree college established in 1961 by Shiksha Prasar Samiti, a volunteer organisation.
