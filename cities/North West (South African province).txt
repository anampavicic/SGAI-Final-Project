'''North West''' ({{langx|tn|Bokone Bophirima}}; {{langx|af|Noord-Wes}} {{IPA|af|ˈnuərt.vɛs|}}) is a [[Provinces of South Africa|province of South Africa]]. Its capital is [[Mahikeng]]. The province is located to the west of the major population centre and [[Provinces of South Africa|province]] of [[Gauteng]] and south of [[Botswana]].

==History==
North West was incorporated after the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, and includes parts of the former [[Transvaal Province]] and [[Cape Province]], as well as most of the former [[bantustan]] of [[Bophuthatswana]]. It was the scene of political violence in [[Khutsong]], [[Merafong City Local Municipality]] in 2006 and 2007, after cross-province municipalities were abolished and Merafong Municipality was transferred entirely to North West. Merafong has since been transferred to [[Gauteng]] province in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bophuthatswana |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/place/bophuthatswana |website=South African History Online |access-date=22 September 2019 |quote=In March 1994 Bophuthatswana was placed under the control of two administrators, Tjaart van der Walt and Job Mokgoro. The small, widespread pieces of land were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994. Bophuthatswana is part of the North West Province under Premier Edna Molewa.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=North West |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/place/north-west |website=South African History Online |access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Merafong City Local Municipality (GT484) |url=https://municipalities.co.za/overview/1063/merafong-city-local-municipality |website=municipalities.co.za |access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref>

==Law and government==
The [[North West Provincial Government|Provincial Government]] consists of a [[Premier of North West|premier]], an executive council of ten ministers, and a legislature. The provincial assembly and premier are elected for five-year terms, or until the next national election. Political parties are awarded assembly seats based on the percentage of votes each party receives in the province during the national elections. The assembly elects a premier, who then appoints the members of the executive council.

The premier of North West Province as of 14 June 2024 is [[Lazzy Mokgosi]] of the [[African National Congress]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=OFM |title=Northwest Provincial Legislature members sworn in |url=https://www.ofm.co.za/article/centralsa/332220/northwest-provincial-legislature-members-sworn-in |access-date=2024-06-19 |website=OFM}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:Sun City.jpg|thumb|The Bridge of Time facing the Entertainment Centre, [[Sun City (South Africa)|Sun City]]]]
The mainstay of the economy of North West Province is mining, which generates more than half of the province's gross domestic product and provides jobs for a quarter of its workforce. The chief minerals are gold, mined at [[Orkney, North West|Orkney]] and [[Klerksdorp, North West|Klerksdorp]]; uranium, mined at Klerksdorp; [[platinum]], mined at [[Rustenburg, North West|Rustenburg]] and [[Brits, North West|Brits]]; and diamonds, mined at [[Lichtenburg, North West|Lichtenburg]], [[Christiana, North West|Christiana]], and [[Bloemhof, North West|Bloemhof]]. About 85% of all money-making activities take place between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom. The economic heart of the province is Klerksdorp. The northern and western parts of the province have many sheep farms and cattle and game ranches. The eastern and southern parts are crop-growing regions that produce maize (corn), sunflowers, tobacco, cotton, and citrus fruits. The entertainment and casino complex at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] and Lost City also contributes to the provincial economy.

The majority of the province's residents are [[Tswana people]] who speak [[Setswana|Tswana]], as in neighbouring [[Botswana]]. Smaller groups include [[Afrikaans]], [[Sotho people|Sotho]], and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] speaking people. English is spoken primarily as a second language. Most of the population belong to Christian denominations. (Figures according to Census 2001 released in July 2003).

According to the 2007 community survey 90.8% of the province's population was [[Black people|Black]] (mostly [[Setswana|Tswana]]-speaking), 7.2% as [[White South African|White]] (mostly [[Afrikaans]] speaking), 1.6% as [[Coloured]] and 0.4% as [[Asian South African|Asian]]. The 2007 community survey showed the province had a population of just over 3 million. The province's white population is very unevenly distributed. In the southern and eastern municipalities, the white percentage in double figures such as the [[Tlokwe Local Municipality|Tlokwe]] and [[City of Matlosana|Matlosana]] where the white percentages were 27% and 12% respectively.

The province has the lowest number of people aged 35 years and older (5.9%) who have received higher education. Since 1994 the number of people receiving higher education has increased. After the disbanding of the [[bantustan]]s, many people migrated to the economic centres of [[Cape Town]] and [[Gauteng]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Internal Migration to the Gauteng Province |url=https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/item/7496/DPRU_WP04-088.pdf?sequence=1 |website=University of Cape Town |access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref>

==Education==
The province had two universities: the [[North-West University]], which was formerly called the University of Bophuthatswana (founded in 1979), in [[Mmabatho]]; and [[Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education]] (founded in 1869; became a constituent college of the University of South Africa in 1921 and an independent university in 1951). These two universities have now merged and the new institution is called North-West University.

As part of the Department of Education's proposed plans for higher education, the existing four higher learning institutions will be merged to form two. During 2003, as part of the Year of Further Education and Training project, three mega institutions, Taletso, ORBIT and Vuselela, were established to provide technical and vocational training to the youth. These institutions have been incorporated into many of the former education and technical colleges and manpower centres.
