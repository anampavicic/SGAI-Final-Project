==Etymology==
The name of Yonago in the Japanese language is formed from two ''[[kanji]]'' characters. The first, {{linktext|米}}, means "rice", and the second, {{linktext|子}} means "child".

==History==
The area of Yonago was part of ancient [[Hōki Province]]. Per the ''[[Kojiki]]'', the tomb of the creator ''[[kami]]'' [[Izanami]] is located on the border of Yonago with neighboring [[Izumo Province]], and many [[Yayoi period]] and [[Kofun period]] remains have been found within city limits. 

In the early [[Edo Period]], the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] appointed [[Nakamura Kazutada]] to be ''[[daimyō]]'' of the 175,000 ''[[koku]]'' Yonago Domain, and reconstructed [[Yonago Castle]]. The center of the modern city of Yonago evolved from the ''[[jōkamachi]]'' of that castle. After Nakamura died without heir, the domain was abolished and its territories incorporated into the holdings of the [[Ikeda clan]] of [[Tottori Domain]]. The Ikeda retained Yonago Castle and assigned it to their hereditary ''[[karō]]'' from the Arao clan who ruled until the [[Meiji restoration]]. 

The town of Yonago was established within Aioi District of Tottori Prefecture with the creation of the modern municipalities system in October 1889. A post office was founded in 1872, a prison in 1877, and a courthouse in 1884. Railway services were established in 1902.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=http://www.city.yonago.lg.jp/secure/27643/shiseiyouran2016.pdf|title=米子市 市勢要覧 2016|publisher=Yonago City|year=2016}}</ref> After becoming Saihaku County through county mergers, Yonago was raised to city status on April 1, 1927. Yonago absorbed the town of [[Yodoe, Tottori|Yodoe]] (from [[Saihaku District, Tottori|Saihaku District]]) on March 31, 2005.<ref name=":0" />

==Government==
[[file:Yonago city office.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Yonago City Hall]]
Yonago has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 26 members. Yonago contributes nine members to the Tottori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Tottori 2nd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
