'''Hanumangarh''' is a city and [[municipal council]] in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]], situated on the banks of the river [[Ghaggar]] also identified as ancient [[Sarasvati river]], located about 400&nbsp;km from [[Delhi]]. It is the administrative headquarter of [[Hanumangarh District]]. The city was once called '''Bhatner''' (alternatively spelled '''Bhatnair''') because it was founded by king Bhupat in 255 AD. It remained in the control of the Rajputs of Bhati clan and faced a historic siege by [[Timur]] in 1391, during which the Bhati Raput king Dulachand lost the fort for a short time.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Rima|last=Hooja|title=A History of Rajasthan|publisher=Rupa and company|year=2006|pages=371|isbn=9788129108906|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tosMAQAAMAAJ&q=dulachand|quote=Bhatner was taken in 1391 by Timur from the Bhati Rajput King named Dulachand}}</ref> The fort was later occupied by Rao Jetsa of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner]].<ref name="ref73zobep">{{Citation|title=The imperial gazetteer of India, Volume 2| author=Sir William Wilson Hunter| year=1885|publisher=Trübner & Co., 1885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIATAAAAYAAJ| quote=''...

== History ==

In 1398, [[Timur]] invaded the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and on his way he attacked Hanumangarh  Fort (Bhatner at that time) defended by its ruler Rao Daljit and his cousin with only 10,000 men. Timur wrestled the fortifications, slayed all the men and enslaved all of the women and children of the Garrison along with their citizens.

===Early modern period===
{{Main| Bhatner | History of Bikaner }}
Hanumangarh was the kingdom of [[Bhati]] [[Rajput]]s and hence its earlier name was [[Bhatner]]. [[Bikaner State#Maharajas|Maharaja Surat Singh Rathore]] (b.1787 – d.1828) of [[Bikaner State]] won this fort on Tuesday. Since Tuesday is the auspicious day of the Hindu deity [[Hanuman]], Surat Singh renamed Bhatner to "Hanumangarh" - the Fort of Hanuman the Hindu-deity. The 1700-year-old [[Bhatner fort]] is situated in the middle of Hanumangarh Town, the description of which can be found in ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bhatner Fort|url=http://hanumangarh.nic.in/places_of_interest.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701185609/http://hanumangarh.nic.in/places_of_interest.htm|archive-date=1 July 2012}}</ref>  A famous [[Bhadrakali]] temple is situated near the town on the banks of Ancient [[Sarasvati river]](Ghaggar river).<ref name="hanumangarh.nic.in">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hanumangarh.nic.in/ |title=Hanumangarh - Land of an old Civilization |access-date=8 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225081904/http://hanumangarh.nic.in/ |archive-date=25 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
