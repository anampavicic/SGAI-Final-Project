'''Puerto Montt''' ([[Mapuche]]: Meli Pulli) is a port [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in southern [[Chile]], located at the northern end of the [[Reloncaví Sound]] in the [[Llanquihue Province]], [[Los Lagos Region]], 1,055&nbsp;km to the south of the capital, [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. The commune spans an area of {{convert|1673|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has a population of 245,902 in 2017. It is bounded by the communes of [[Puerto Varas]] to the north, [[Cochamó]] to the east and southeast, [[Calbuco]] to the southwest and [[Maullín]] and [[Los Muermos]] to the west.

Founded as late as 1853 during the [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German colonization of southern Chile]], Puerto Montt soon outgrew older neighboring cities through its strategic position at the southern end of the [[Chilean Central Valley]] being a gateway city into the [[Chiloé Archipelago]], the [[Llanquihue Lake|Llanquihue]] and [[Nahuel Huapi Lake|Nahuel Huapi]] lakes and [[Zona Austral|Western Patagonia]].

Puerto Montt has gained renown and grown significantly through the rise of Chile to become the second largest salmon producer of the world during the 1990s and 2000s. However, the [[Aquaculture in Chile|Chilean salmon aquaculture crisis]] of the late 2000s resulted in severe [[unemployment]] and exposed weaknesses in the local economy. The city's cultural endowment mixes elements of Chilean-Spanish culture with a German heritage. The city has attracted a significant number of newcomers from all over Chile in the last 30 years{{which|date=April 2024}} in search of employment opportunities.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

==History==
Originally, the site was covered by thick forest and was called ''Melipulli'' (which means "four hills" in [[Mapudungun]]). It was selected as an entrance to [[Lake Llanquihue]] when its proximity to the open sea was discovered. The expedition was entrusted to [[Bernhard Eunom Philippi|Bernardo Philippi]], a German naturalist and cartographer, but after his death in 1851, Vicente Perez Rosales took over his duties, and by the end of September started to chop trees at Reloncaví sound using local woodsman coming from Huar, Maillen, Huelmo and Calbuco Mainly. By December, after the forest was cut down, the area was burned to clear the land in anticipation of completing the settlement plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariollanquihue.cl/prontus3_turismo/site/artic/20040805/pags/20040805210248.html |title=Historia de Puerto Montt |author=César A.

In 1912, the city was connected by train to Santiago, making it an important point of entry into Chilean Patagonia and augmenting its commercial development. By 1950, it had a population of 27,500, and the city was rapidly urbanizing. However, the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] destroyed much of Puerto Montt, collapsing the port and the train station along with many building and houses. Eventually the city recovered, becoming once again an important urban centre as well as a port of national interest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-783.html#presentacion |title=Puerto Montt 1853-2002 |publisher=Memoria Chilena |access-date=April 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424035000/http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-783.html#presentacion |archive-date=April 24, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1969 violence===
{{Main|Massacre of Puerto Montt}}
At the start of March 1969, approximately 90 landless people received poor advice from [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist]] [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Member of Parliament]] Luis Espinoza. The families were never granted land needed to build their homes. On March 4, 1969, the families settled on empty, unoccupied farmland owned by an absentee landlord. The families sought squatters' rights. Approximately four to five days after moving onto the land, the local [[Carabineros de Chile|Police Chief]] Rolando Rodríguez Marbán assured the squatters that they would not be disturbed, and could proceed with their home construction. Unfortunately, the Ministry of the Interior changed their orders, which led to tragic results.

On midnight on March 9, Luis Espinoza [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist]] [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|member of parliament]] was charged with breaking the law, arrested, and moved to the city of [[Valdivia (city)|Valdivia]], where he was held.  Following direct orders from the Minister of Interior [[Edmundo Pérez Zujovic]], 250 armed policemen launched an assault on the squatting families at dawn.  Eight squatters were shot dead. Two squatters, a 9-month child and an adult later died from their wounds. The newly built homes were decimated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cctt.cl/correo/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2561:chile-9-de-marzo-de-1969-masacre-en-puerto-montt-ni-olvido-ni-perdon&catid=24&Itemid=60 |title=Chile: 9 de marzo de 1969, masacre en Puerto Montt, ni olvido, ni perdón. |publisher=Correo de los trabajadores |access-date=April 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426173500/http://www.cctt.cl/correo/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2561:chile-9-de-marzo-de-1969-masacre-en-puerto-montt-ni-olvido-ni-perdon&catid=24&Itemid=60 |archive-date=April 26, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The massacre is poignantly memorialized by singer-songwriter [[Víctor Jara]] in his song [[Pongo En Tus Manos Abiertas (album)#Preguntas por Puerto Montt|Preguntas por Puerto Montt]].

The massacre of Puerto Montt and the public outcry that followed were major factors contributing to the defeat of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]]'s party in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|Chilean presidential election of 1970]] which was succeeded by [[Salvador Allende]]'s [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Unidad Popular]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Late 20th century===
By 1979, Puerto Montt was nominated and later become the Capital of Los Lagos Region, thereby becoming the principal administrative, political and commercial centre of Southern Chile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.puertomontt.cl/puerto-montt/historia/ |title=Historia |publisher=Municipalidad de Puerto Montt |author=Oficina Municipal de Patrimonio Cultural. |access-date=April 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517213730/http://www.puertomontt.cl/puerto-montt/historia/ |archive-date=May 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 1982, the commune already reached 103,680 inhabitants. From the late 1980s, the city began to experience a new accelerated growth, both in population and in the economic sphere, mainly due to the installation of the industry Chilean salmon farm, of which Puerto Montt became its nerve center.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

==Demographics==
According to the 2017 [[census]], Puerto Montt has 245,902 inhabitants (121,019 men and 124,883 women), of which 25,759 live in [[rural area]]s and 220,143 live in [[urban area]]s. From 218,858 inhabitants in the 2012 census, the population grew by 12.36% (27,044 people).

Of the overall population, 52,483 belong to [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups, with 50,247 being [[Mapuche]], 314 [[Aymara people]], 73 [[Rapa Nui people]], 19 [[Atacama people|Lican Antai]], 84 [[Quechua people]], 27 [[Qulla|Colla]], 136 [[Diaguita]], 114 [[Alacalufe|Kawésqar]], 38 [[Yaghan people|Yahgan]], 175 other and 1,256 declaring indigenous status but not identifying a group.

About 1.46% of the population (3,595 people) are immigrants, with 199 reporting originating from [[Peru]], 596 from [[Colombia]], 269 from [[Venezuela]], 40 from [[Bolivia]], 1,527 from [[Argentina]], 44 from [[Haiti]], 194 from [[Ecuador]], 157 from [[South America]], 153 from [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]], 52 from [[North America]], 242 from [[Europe]], 83 from [[Asia]], 16 from [[Africa]], 6 from [[Oceania]] and 17 not declaring.<ref name = "INE2017"/>

== Climate ==
Puerto Montt has a wet [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') with heavy rainfall throughout the year but a drying trend in the summer. Although temperatures are consistently below {{convert|25|C|F}}, frosts are very rare and occur only a couple of times per month in the winter. For the [[41st parallel south]], closer to the [[equator]] than to the [[South Pole]], Puerto Montt is much cooler than areas further inland in terms of summer temperatures, due to cool ocean currents nearby.{{cn|date=April 2024}} This is compounded by the lack of a sizeable landmass on those parallels in the southern hemisphere. That means that Puerto Montt has much cooler summers than areas at similar distances from the equator in the northern hemisphere.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

==Economy==
{{see also|Aquaculture in Chile}}
Puerto Montt is the capital of the [[Los Lagos Region]] and the [[Llanquihue Province]], and the main sea port at the lower end of Chile's western continental land. The city is the principal commercial, services, and financial hub of the Chilean [[Patagonia#Chilean Patagonia|Northern Patagonia]]—[[Zona Austral]].

Puerto Montt is also the gateway to the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] and [[Chiloé Island]] across the [[Chacao Channel]], and the many other smaller islands in Chile's inland [[Sea of Chiloé]].

The city's economy is now based upon agriculture, cattle, and [[forestry]] on the surrounding islands, and fishing and [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon aquaculture]] in the [[Fjords and channels of Chile|fjords]] and nearby Pacific Ocean.

=== History ===
{{unreferencedsect|date=April 2024}}
During the 19th century, before and after the founding of Puerto Montt, the extraction and commercialization of wood, mainly larch, was the main economic activity in the area. Other existing items since the creation of the city were, to a lesser extent, alcohol distilleries, grain oil factories, breweries and the sale of items imported from Germany or Valparaíso. Puerto Montt, as the capital, was vital in the entry and exit of merchandise to the area, since the seaway was the only way to get the products out - the train would only arrive in 1912.
;Salmon aquaculture
The city is configured as the hub of one of the largest [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon aquaculture]] industries in the world. Hatcheries, fisheries and packing plants are mostly located south of Puerto Montt. Fresh salmon is flown daily to world markets and frozen salmon is shipped by ocean to all destinations. The tremendous growth of the region, mainly due to the salmon industry, but also due to rapid expansion of forestry, cattle, and tourism, has proven the massive economic potential of Puerto Montt and its surrounding area.

==Transport==
[[El Tepual Airport]] is the main commercial airport serving the city. Three airlines operate regular flights to and from [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Punta Arenas]], [[Balmaceda, Chile|Balmaceda]], and [[Antofagasta, Chile|Antofagasta]]. The airlines operating at the airport are [[LATAM Airlines]] (the country's largest), [[Sky Airline]] and [[JetSmart]]. The flight time to Santiago is approximately two hours.
