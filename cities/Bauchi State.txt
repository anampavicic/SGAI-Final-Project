'''Bauchi State''' (Fula: ''Leydi Bauchi'' ðž¤¤ðž¤«ðž¤´ðž¤£ðž¤­ ðž¤¦ðž¤¢ðž¤µðž¤·ðž¥…ðž¤­) is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[North East (Nigeria)|North-East geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]]. It is bordered by [[Jigawa State|Jigawa]] to the north, [[Yobe State|Yobe]] to the northeast, [[Gombe State|Gombe]] to the east, [[Taraba State|Taraba]] and [[Plateau State|Plateau]] to the south, [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]] to the west and [[Kano State|Kano]] to the northwest.  It takes its name from the historic city of [[Bauchi]], which also serves as its capital. The state was formed in 1976 when the former [[North-Eastern State]] was broken up. It originally included the area that is now [[Gombe State]], which became a distinct state in 1996.

Of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]], Bauchi is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|fifth largest in area]] and also the [[List of Nigerian states by population|fifth most populous]], with an estimated population of over 8,308,800 as of 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bauchi (State, Nigeria) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/nigeria/admin/NGA005__bauchi/ |access-date=2024-07-06 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> Geographically, the state is divided between the [[West Sudanian savanna]] in the south and the drier, [[semi-desert]] [[Sahelian savanna]] in the north with a small part of the montane [[Jos Plateau]] in the southwest.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Bauchi {{!}} state, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bauchi-state-Nigeria |access-date=2022-02-27 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> A key defining characteristic of the stateâ€™s landscape is [[Yankari National Park]], a large wildlife park in southern Bauchi State that contains large populations of [[waterbuck]], [[African buffalo]], [[patas monkey]], [[hippopotamus]], [[roan antelope]], and [[Hartebeest|western hartebeest]] along with some of Nigeria's last remaining [[West African lion]], [[African leopard]] and [[African bush elephant]] populations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yankari Game Reserve |url=https://nigeria.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Yankari-Game-Reserve.aspx |website=[[Wildlife Conservation Society|WCS]] Nigeria |access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref>

What is now Bauchi State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the [[Bole language|Bolewa]], Butawa, and [[Warji language|Warji]] in the central region; the [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], and [[Karai-Karai (language)|Karai-Karai]] in the north; the Bankal, Jaku and [[Gera language|Gerawa]] in and around the city of [[Bauchi]]; the [[Saya language|Zaar and the Gwak]] in the south; the [[Duguri language|Dugurawa]] in the southeast; and the [[Jarawa (Nigeria)|Jarawa]] in the southwest. Religiously, the vast majority of the state's population (~80%) are [[Muslims|Muslim]] with smaller [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Traditional African religions|traditionalist]] minorities at about 15% and 5%, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Azare Town {{!}} Bauchi State |url=http://www.fmcazare.gov.ng/azare.html |access-date=2022-02-27 |website=www.fmcazare.gov.ng}}</ref> Evangelicals are the dominant Christian denomination but there are also adherents of the Roman Catholic faith. The [[Anglican Diocese of Bauchi]] is part of the Province of Jos, within the Church of Nigeria.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

As a major agriculture-based state, the Bauchi State economy partially relies on livestock and crops, such as [[cotton]], [[Peanut|groundnuts]], [[millet]], [[tomatoes]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] with advanced irrigation schemes increasing agricultural production since statehood. Other industries include food processing and canning facilities, [[tin]] and [[columbite]] mining, and tourism in Yankari National Park and its Wikki Warm Springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/56324/Bauchi|title=Bauchi - state, Nigeria|website=britannica.com|access-date=14 December 2021|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018232704/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/56324/Bauchi|archive-date=18 October 2014}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
According to [[tradition]], it was named after a hunter known as Baushe, who settled in the [[region]] before the arrival of Yakubu, the first traditional ruler of the Bauchi emirate (founded 1800â€“10).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/56324/Bauchi|title=Bauchi - state, Nigeria|website=britannica.com|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018232704/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/56324/Bauchi|archive-date=18 October 2014}}</ref>
Bauchi and [[Adamawa Emirate|Adamawa]] were the two main sources of freedom and tourism for the [[Sokoto Caliphate|Fulani empire of Sokoto]].<ref name="HASJ161">{{cite book

==History==
{{See also|Bauchi Emirate}}
What is now known as Bauchi, was until 1976 a province in the then [[North-Eastern State]] of Nigeria. According to the 2006 census, the state has a population of 4,653,066.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Member Countries {{!}} Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Africa Region |url=https://www.cpaafricaregion.or.tz/member-countries/76#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202006%20census,tremendous%20transformation%20over%20the%20years. |access-date=2023-10-23 |website=www.cpaafricaregion.or.tz}}</ref>

In the early 1800s, the [[Fulani jihad]] seized much of modern-day Bauchi State and formed the [[Bauchi Emirate]] under the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. About 90 years later, a British expedition occupied the Emirate and incorporated it as Bauchi Province into the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]] before becoming independent as [[Nigeria]] in 1960. Originally, modern-day Bauchi State was a part of the post-independence [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[North-Eastern State]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-01-07 |title=Bauchi State |url=https://www.nipc.gov.ng/nigeria-states/bauchi-state/ |access-date=2022-02-27 |website=Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission |language=en-US}}</ref> After the North-Eastern State was split, Bauchi State was formed on 3 February 1976 alongside ten other states. 

Twenty years after statehood, a group of LGAs in the state's west was broken off to form the new [[Gombe State]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sani |first=Adamu |last2=Saleh |first2=Yuguda |last3=Abdulmalik |first3=Sulaiman |last4=Raymond |first4=Tabale P. |last5=Mshelia |first5=Dahiru S. |date=2022-02-15 |title=Heavy Metal Contents of Sachet Water in Gombe, Nigeria. |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.36020/kjms.2021.1502.002 |journal=Kanem Journal Medical Sciences |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=1â€“6 |doi=10.36020/kjms.2021.1502.002 |issn=2006-4772}}</ref>

With the creation of Bauchi State in 1976, then comprising present Bauchi and [[Gombe State]], it included 16 local government areas. The number of local government areas in the then Bauchi State was increased to 20 and later to 23. However, in 1997 when Gombe State was created out of Bauchi and additional local governments were created in the country, Bauchi State was left with 20 local government areas as shown below.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}

Bauchi State has gone through a tremendous transformation over the years. The [[Ajawa language]] was spoken in Bauchi State, but became extinct by 1940 as speakers [[Language shift|shifted]] to [[Hausa language|Hausa]].<ref>{{e25|ajw|Ajawa}}</ref> Sharia law was adopted in June 2001.<ref name="IRB">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/research/publications/index_e.htm?docid=70&cid=161&version=printable&disclaimer=show&sec=CH05 |title=Issue Paper:NigÃ©ria / Protection offerte par l'Ã©tat |access-date=2008-07-08 |work=irb-cisr.gc.ca |publisher=Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, April 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320131003/http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/research/publications/index_e.htm?docid=70&cid=161&version=printable&disclaimer=show&sec=CH05 |archive-date=20 March 2005 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Bauchi State occupies a total land area of {{convert|49119|km2|abbr=on}} representing about 5.3% of Nigeria's total land mass and is located between latitudes 9Â° 3' and 12Â° 3' north and longitudes 8Â° 50' and [[11Â° east]].

The state is bordered by seven states, [[Jigawa State|Jigawa]] to the north, [[Taraba State|Taraba]] for 54&nbsp;km and [[Plateau State|Plateau]] for {{cvt|360|km}} to the south, [[Gombe State|Gombe]] for {{cvt|277|km}} to the east, [[Yobe State|Yobe]] for {{cvt|188|km}} to the north-east, [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]] to the west for {{cvt|32|km}}, and [[Kano State|Kano]] for {{cvt|131|km}} to the north-west.<ref>distances from Google Maps</ref>

Bauchi state is one of the states in the northern part of Nigeria that span two distinctive [[vegetation]] zones, namely, the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan savannah]] and the [[Sahel|Sahel savannah]]. The Sudan savannah type of vegetation covers the southern part of the state. Here, the vegetation gets richer and richer towards the south, especially along water sources or [[river]]s, but generally, the vegetation is less uniform and grasses are shorter than what grows even farther south, that is, in the forest zone of the middle belt.

The Sahel type of savannah, also known as [[semi-desert]] vegetation, becomes manifest from the middle of the state as one moves from the state's south to its north. This type of vegetation comprises isolated stands of [[Spine (botany)|thorn]]y [[shrub]]s.

On the other hand, the southwestern part of the state is [[mountain]]ous as a result of the continuation of the [[Jos Plateau]], while the northern part is generally [[sand]]y.

The vegetation types as described above are conditioned by the [[Climate|climatic]] factors, which in turn determine the amount of [[rain]]fall received in the area. For instance, the rainfall in Bauchi state ranges between {{convert|1300|mm}} per annum in the south and only {{convert|700|mm}} per annum in the extreme north. This pattern is because in the [[West Africa]] sub-region, rains generally come from the south as they are carried by the south-westerlies. There is therefore a progressive dryness towards the north, culminating in the [[desert]] condition in the far north. So also is the case in Bauchi state.
[[File:Sumu wildlife park002.jpg|300px|thumb|Sumu Wildlife Park]]
Consequently, rains start earlier in the southern part of the state, where rain is heaviest and lasts longer. Here the rains start in April with the highest record amount of {{convert|1300|mm}} per annum. In contrast, the northern part of the state receives the rains late, usually around June or July, and records the highest amount of {{convert|700|mm}} per annum.

In the same vein, the weather experienced in the south and the north varies considerably. While it is [[Humidity|humidly]] hot during the early part of the rainy season in the south, the hot, dry and dusty weather lingers up north.

In addition to rainfall, Bauchi state is watered by a number of rivers. They include the [[Gongola River|Gongola]] and [[Jama'are River|Jama'are]] rivers.

The [[Gongola River]] crosses Bauchi state in [[Tafawa Balewa]] Local Government Area in the south and in [[Kirfi]] and [[Alkaleri]] Local Government Areas in the eastern part of the state, while the Jamaâ€™are River cuts across a number of Local Government Areas in the northern part of the state. Moreover, a substantial part of the Hadeja-Jama'are River basin lies in Bauchi state, which along with various fadama (floodplain) areas in the state provides suitable land for [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities. These are further supported by the number of [[dam]]s meant for [[irrigation]] and other purposes. These include the [[Gubi Dam|Gubi]] and [[Tilde-Fulani Dam|Tilde-Fulani]] dams. There are also lakes such as the [[Maladumba Lake]] in [[Misau]] Local Government Area that further provide the necessary conditions to support [[Agriculture]].

===Climate===

Bauchi has an oppressive wet season while the dry season is partly cloudy, and it is hot year-round. Over the year, the temperature also varies.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bauchi Climate, Weather By Month, Average Temperature (Nigeria) - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/61868/Average-Weather-in-Bauchi-Nigeria-Year-Round |access-date=2023-06-30 |website=weatherspark.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Bauchi Annual Weather Averages |url=https://www.worldweatheronline.com/bauchi-weather/bauchi/ng.aspx |access-date=2023-06-30 |website=WorldWeatherOnline.com |language=en}}</ref> 

Like every other state in Nigeria, Bauchi state has not been spared in devastating effects of climate change. On 11 July 2022, the acting Director-general of the Bauchi State Emergency Management Agency (BASEMA), Mr Bala Lame, said "No fewer than 100 houses and several farmlands have been destroyed by devastating floods in Darazo LGA of the state". This he attributed to flooding after three days of persistent rainfall in the area.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-07-18 |title=Climate Watch: Flood destroys 100 houses, farmlands in Bauchi |url=https://www.thecable.ng/climate-watch-flood-destroys-100-houses-farmlands-in-bauchi |access-date=2022-11-30 |website=TheCable |language=en-US}}</ref> The average annual temperature ranges from 57 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with occasional exceptions when it falls below 51 or rises over 104.

The greatest time of year to visit Bauchi for warm-weather activities, according to the tourist score, is from early December to early February.

== Average Temperature in Bauchi ==
From 28 February to 10 May is the hot season, which lasts 2.5 months and has an average daily high temperature of over 96&nbsp;Â°F. Averaging a high of 99&nbsp;Â°F and a low of 74&nbsp;Â°F, April is the hottest month of the year in Bauchi.

From 15 July to 1 October, the cool season, which has an average daily high temperature below 86&nbsp;Â°F, lasts for 2.6 months. With an average low of 58&nbsp;Â°F and high of 90&nbsp;Â°F, January is the coldest month of the year in Bauchi.<ref name=":0" />

== Air Pollution in Bauchi ==
Particulate matter, which has a diameter of less than 10 microns and is 1/7th the thickness of a human hair, is a significant source of air pollution in Bauchi.
