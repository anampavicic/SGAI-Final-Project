'''Kolomna''' ({{langx|ru|Коломна}}, {{IPA|ru|kɐˈlomnə|IPA}}) is a historic [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russia]], situated at the [[confluence]] of the [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Oka River]]s, {{convert|114|km|sp=us}} (by rail) southeast of [[Moscow]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=144,589|p2002=150,129|p1989=161,881}}

==History==
Mentioned for the first time in 1177, Kolomna<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moscovery.com/kolomna/|title=The History of Kolomna|website=[in English]|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225505/https://www.moscovery.com/kolomna/|url-status=dead}}</ref> was founded in 1140–1160 according to the latest archaeological surveys.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} Мазуров А. Б. Средневековая Коломна в XIV — первой трети XVI вв. / Под ред. В. Л. Янина. М.: Александрия, 2001. С. 58</ref> Kolomna's name may originate from the [[Old East Slavic|Old Russian]] term for "on the bend (in the river)", especially as the old city is located on a sharp bend in the [[Moskva River|Moscow River]]. In 1301, Kolomna became the first town to be incorporated into the [[Moscow Principality]].<ref>Nossov K. S. Medieval Russian Fortresses AD 862-1480. Osprey Publishing. 2012. P. 8</ref>

Like some other ancient Russian cities, it has a [[Kolomna Kremlin|kremlin]], which is a [[citadel]] similar to the [[Moscow Kremlin|more famous one in Moscow]] and also built of red [[brick]].<ref>Brumfield W. C. Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey. Routledge. Pp. 94-95</ref> The stone Kolomna Kremlin was built from 1525–1531 under the Russian Tsar [[Vasily III]]. The Kolomna citadel was a part of the [[Zasechnaya cherta|Great Abatis Border]]<ref>[http://img-2005-08.photosight.ru/07/977038.jpg Several towers and two parts of walls]</ref> and, although much of the surrounding wall was removed in the eighteenth century and materials used to construct other public buildings, the remaining stretch of wall,  several towers, and some interior buildings have been preserved and held in good shape with a museum located inside. In front of the façade stands a statue of [[Dmitry Donskoy]], celebrating the gathering of his troops in Kolomna prior to the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380.

The [[Civic heraldry|civic arms]] of Kolomna were granted by [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine II]], who was influenced by the similar-sounding name of the famous [[Colonna family|Colonna]] family of [[Rome]]. Hence, the similar appearance of the arms, despite there being no connection between the Roman family and the city of Kolomna.

Due to sensitive military production of missile components, Kolomna was a [[closed city]] until 1994. It is not listed as a city of the [[Golden Ring of Russia|Golden Ring]], despite its kremlin and the large number of well-preserved churches and monasteries.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[administrative divisions of Moscow Oblast|framework of administrative divisions]], Kolomna serves as the [[administrative center]] of [[Kolomensky District]], even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="Ref1406">Law #11/2013-OZ</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as '''Kolomna [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Oblast Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Moscow Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref1406" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Kolomna City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Kolomna Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref785">Law #153/2004-OZ</ref>
