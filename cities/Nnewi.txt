Nnewi kingdom was founded on four quarters (large villages), namely [[Otolo]], [[Uruagu]], [[Umudim]], and [[Nnewichi]]. Villages are made up of communities which in turn are Each divided into family units called 'umunna'. Each umunna had a first family known as the 'obi'.<ref name="Introduction to Nnewi:">{{cite web | title = Introduction to Nnewi | work = Nnewi Union Atlanta | url = http://www.nnewiunionatlanta.8m.com/index.html | access-date = 2008-04-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050207054522/http://nnewiunionatlanta.8m.com/index.html | archive-date = 2005-02-07 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

The origins of the four villages had been a source of controversy as no one could really tell the original history of Nnewi and the development of the villages. History was not written down in this part of the world then. According to Dr. Okonkwo Alutu in Nnewi History, the most probable progenitor of the Nnewi people was a man called Mmaku. He migrated from Ndoni and had a son whom he named Ikéngà. Ikéngà had four sons; Nnewi, Isu, Ifite and Ichi. Nnewi went on to father six sons namely Digbo, Uru, Eze, Eke, Ekweludikonwu and Nnagha. Digbo begat Otolo, progenitor of the only village named after a descendant of Nnewi. The other three villages were founded by the other sons of Nnewi and migrants.

===The Place of Nnewi in Igbo History===
Originally when the Igbos settled in the present day Eastern Nigeria, they arrived with three leaders, two were spiritual leaders and the youngest of the three a hereditary King known as [[King|Obi]] a King by birthright.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Government |url=https://nnewicommunity.com/government/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=Nnewi City Portal {{!}} Anambra State, Nigeria |language=en-US}}</ref> The first was the [[Priest King|Eze Nri]] of Awka a Priest King, the second the [[Priest King|Eze Aro]] of Arochukwu a  King and the third the [[Obi of Nnewi]] a political and war ruler.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Government |url=https://nnewicommunity.com/government/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=Nnewi City Portal {{!}} Anambra State, Nigeria |language=en-US}}</ref> The Onitsha people are visitors and later settlers in Igbo land.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rapheal |date=2019-12-31 |title=Onitsha: One city, many faces |url=https://sunnewsonline.com/onitsha-one-city-many-faces/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=The Sun Nigeria |language=en}}</ref> [[Arochukwu|The Aros]] know this history (Nnewi being a relation and a leader among the Igbos) and this is part of the reason why there are no [[Arochukwu|Aro]] settlements in Nnewi.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UNHCR Web Archive |url=https://webarchive.archive.unhcr.org/20230530083559/https://www.refworld.org/docid/3df4be7f2c.html |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=webarchive.archive.unhcr.org}}</ref> The Obi of Nnewi Obi Okoli in1780s lost his throne when inside palace politics that hinged on tradition edged him out.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Government |url=https://nnewicommunity.com/government/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=Nnewi City Portal {{!}} Anambra State, Nigeria |language=en-US}}</ref> Traditional royal law had it that the Crown Prince must perform the funeral rights of the late Obi before he can be crowned, Obi Okoli was absent and arrived home only after the late Obi Okoli 1st was buried {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

The Obi Okoli royal lineage  was forced into exile, they got refuge at Umune-Alam in Umudim, Nnewi where they still are to this day. The Obi Okoli family still bears the [[Ofor A Spiritual Political symbol of power|Ofor]] Nnewi till this day {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

Edo is the [[King of the gods|supreme deity]] of all the [[Alusi]] (Igbo: ''deity'') in the Anaedo country {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

There are four other deities in Nnewi: Ana, Ezemewi, Eze and Ele {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. [[Christianity]] was introduced by the Europeans in 1885 and many Nnewi people now practice Christianity {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

Nnewi, Ichi and Oraifite made up the Anaedo state {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. Anaedo communities have common ancestries, beliefs and traditional value systems {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. Nnewi is a major trading and manufacturing center in Nigeria {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. Due to its high commercial activities, the city has attracted millions of migrants from other [[States of Nigeria|states]] and countries {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

The [[Ofala Festival|Ofala Nnewi]] is a cultural festival held every year to celebrate the coronation of the Igwe of Nnewi {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. [[Nnewi Afiaolu Festival|Afiaolu]] ([[New Yam Festival of the Igbo|New yam festival]]) and Ikwuaru are also among traditional festivals held annually in Nnewi.

==Geography==
Geographically, Nnewi falls within the [[tropical rain forest]] region of [[Nigeria]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. Though it suffers from soil leaching and [[erosion]] which has reduced the soil in some areas to a porous sandy terrain, it remains an area of rich agricultural produce and the epicenter of business trade {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. The city is located east of the [[Niger River]], and about 22 kilometers south east of [[Onitsha]] in [[Anambra State]], [[Nigeria]].<ref name="bioline.org">{{cite journal | last=Nfor | first=BN | title=Lignite zone as an indicator to lost circulation belt: a case study of some locations of Anambra State, Southeastern Nigeria | journal=Journal of Applied Sciences and Environmental Management | publisher=African Journals Online (AJOL) | volume=10 | issue=3 | date=2006-10-31 | issn=1119-8362 | doi=10.4314/jasem.v10i3.17315 | url = https://www.bioline.org.br/request?ja06048| doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Government==
The traditional monarch of Nnewi is called the [[Igwe of Nnewi kingdom|Igwe]]. The Igweship in Nnewi kingdom predates the arrival of Europeans, making it a unique [[monarchy]] in [[Igbo people|Igbo]] land {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. The Igbos are known for not having kings, hence the popular Igbo saying 'Igbo é nwě Eze', meaning 'the Igbos have no king'. In other Igbo clans, the British colonial administrators created warrant chiefs who then assumed the office and title of Igwe and are elected to this day.
In Nnewi, the Igwe is the isi obi (head of the [[Obi (ruler)|Obis]]) and hence the Igwe, which literally translates as the heavenly one or highness as he is the holder of the [[Ofo in Igboland|Ofo]], the religious and political symbol. He is born and not made or elected, and the institution of inheritance is the traditional right and privilege.
The position is neither transferable nor negotiable. He is also an Obi. Obi is the title held by ruling [[Tribal chief|chief]]s; it is the equivalent of a [[duke]] in the [[nobility]].<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Igwe nnewi.jpg|thumb|The 20th Obi of [[Otolo]] and Igwe ([[King]]) of Nnewi Kingdom, His Royal Highness Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III]]
The present reigning monarch is [[His Royal Highness Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III]]; he is the longest serving monarch in Nigeria<ref name="Igwe of Nnewi">{{cite web |title = Nnewi Monarch|work = The Official Nnewi City Portal|url = http://www.nnewi.info/nnewi-monarch|access-date = 2015-09-14}}</ref> and he is currently the 20th monarch in the Nnofo Royal lineage. Igwe Kenneth Orizu III is the first class chief in [[Anambra state]] from Nnewi as well as the vice Chairman of the [[Anambra State]] House of Chiefs {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. [[File:IgweAndObis.jpg|thumb|The traditional rulers of Nnewi]]

There are Obis in the four clans that make up Nnewi. The highest and the most senior obi is the Obi of Otolo, who is also the [[Igwe of Nnewi kingdom|Igwe of Nnewi]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. Chief Afamefuna Obi, Obi Bennett Okafor and Obi George Onyekaba are the current obis of Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi, respectively {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. These three obis with Igwe Orizu, III as chairman constitute the Igwe-in-Council and they deliberate on the spiritual, traditional, and communal matters, in Nnewi {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

There is also an active town union called the [[Nzuko-Ora Nnewi]]. It is a forum through which adult Nnewi indigenes (18 years or older) can contribute to the development of Nnewi. This union was set up to encourage and promote the establishment of structures and facilities that will promote and improve the quality of life of the residents of Nnewi {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

===Legal system===
The ancient [[legal system]] of Nnewi was not based upon a written [[law]]. It was purely a [[natural law]], involving custom, tradition, and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal]] cases {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. The legal process in Nnewi passed through the labyrinth of extended family system. A report against an offender or a [[criminal]] in the first instance, had to be made to the head of his family at his ancestral home known as obi {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. The head of the family would invite elders and minor obis from his extended family unit to sit in judgment, while the complainant would also invite the elders and minor obis from his extended family side, if both of them were not from the same family {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. These obis' would serve as the court of the first instance, depending on the nature of the offense or crime allegedly committed {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. The trial might end here, if both the complainant and the accused were satisfied with the judgment given, or they might take the case to the next senior obi of the same extended' family, in ascending order, until, probably, the matter got to the highest obi in the lineage {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. If the complainant was not satisfied at this point, he would appeal to the obi of the quarter and the leaders of his family could be summoned to defend their judgment.<ref name="Nnewi.info">{{cite web |title = Ancient Legal System|work = Ancient Legal System in Nnewi|url = http://www.nnewi.info/nnewi-ancient-legal-system|access-date = 2009-11-15}}</ref>

Through this legal procedure, guilt or innocence could easily be established, as the decision was based purely on natural justice {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. Punishments for offenses and criminal acts were given in relation to their gravity {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. A man who was found guilty of a serious crime might have no option than to be sold into slavery or expelled from the community for life {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. He would not be killed because the killing of human beings was against the injunction of Edo Goddess {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.
The [[judicial system]] in Nnewi seems to have recognized three classes of cases, the minor offenses, the true criminal case, and the civil suits of debt, bride price and land {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. The breaking of by-laws was really an offence against some particular juju and as such was to be expiated by a sacrifice {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. For example, it is forbidden to kill "eke" [[snake]], a type of python, or to eat "ewi," rodent of rabbit family. It is probable these laws were never broken willingly and if broken by accident, the offender would automatically perform a sacrifice without any form of judicial trial being held {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}. 
The criminal code, with regard to serious crimes, appears to have been more developed in Nnewi than elsewhere in Igboland. There were seven main classes of offences, which were known as "ori-obi," offenses against the obi, as their investigation was always carried out in the obi of the quarter {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}.

Among the Christian community, the [[catholic]] and [[Anglican Communion]] shares a greater number of followers followed by other Pentecostal Christian groups.
[[Christianity]] first came on the Southeastern part of Nigeria with the arrival of the Holy Ghost missionaries from Gabon to Onitsha under the leadership of Fr. Joseph Lutz late on Saturday December 5, 1885. Fr. Joseph Shanahan (The Apostle of Igboland) joined them in 1902 and when the mantle of leadership fell on him in 1905, history was set to record the evangelization of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nnewi]]. The stream of this evangelization was to flow through two main courses almost concurrently: one having Nnewi as its source and the other Ozubulu/Ihiala.

Though individuals from various communities have come in contact with the faith as they traveled to Onitsha and other places for trade and in quest of western education, the actual planting of the seed of the gospel in Nnewi Diocese from the Catholic perspective sprang from the treks of Fr. Victor Duhaze to Ozubulu through Oguta (1906) and to Nnewi through Umuoji, Ojoto Mili Agu down to Odida Nnewichi in 1906.

However, the [[Anglican]] Church was established in Nnewi from [[Obosi]] in 1893. But the seed of what is today Nnewi Diocese was sown in 1809. Requests were made by Odida. Community in Nnewichi inviting Fr. [[J. Shanahan]]. In the same year, some Ozubulu indigenes had registered the same requests for establishing a Church station at Ozubulu. Nnewi people are proud of there traditional [[Odinani]] as well as the new religion of Christianity.
