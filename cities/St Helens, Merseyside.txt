'''St Helens''' ({{Audio|en-uk-StHelens.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a town in [[Merseyside]], England, with a population of 102,629. It is the administrative centre of the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens]], which had a population of 183,200 at the [[United Kingdom Census 2021|2021 Census]].<ref name=Samuel>{{cite book | editor=Lewis, Samuel | title=A Topographical Dictionary of England| publisher=Hedon - Helmington | year=1848 | pages=466–470 | isbn=0-8063-1508-3}}</ref><ref name="CivilParish">{{cite web |url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/244 |title=History of St Helens in Lancashire|author=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth|publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref><ref name="Census2001a">{{cite web |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/index.html |title=Census 2001 Key Statistics, Urban areas in England and Wales|author=Census 2001|publisher=ONS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Census 2021 |first=ONS |title=How life has changed in St. Helens: Census 2021 |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censusareachanges/E08000013/ |access-date=2023-02-23 |website=Office for National Statistics |language=en}}</ref>

The town is {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the [[River Mersey]], in the south-west part of [[Historic counties of England|historic]] [[Lancashire]]. The town was initially a small settlement within the historic county's ancient [[hundred (county division)|''hundred'']] of [[West Derby (hundred)|West Derby]] in the [[Township (England)|township]] of [[Windle, St Helens|Windle]] but by the mid-1700s the town had developed into a larger urban area beyond the townships borders. By 1838 the council was formally made responsible for the administration of Windle and the three other townships of [[Eccleston, St Helens|Eccleston]], [[Parr, St Helens|Parr]] and [[Sutton, St Helens|Sutton]] that were to form the town's traditional shape. In 1868 the town was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]], then later became a [[county borough]] in 1887. In 1974 the town was made a [[metropolitan borough]] within the new Metropolitan County of Merseyside by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], with an expanded administrative responsibility for several nearby towns and villages.<ref name=WestDerby>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10112606|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523153115/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10112606|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-05-23|title=Administrative Unit West Derby Hundred|author=University of Portsmouth|publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref><ref name=WestDerby2>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41279 |title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3|author1=William Farrer|author2=J.

The town was famous for its heavy industry, particularly its role in the [[coal mining]] industry, [[glassmaking]], chemicals and copper smelting and sail making that drove its growth throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Originally home to a large number of industrial employers such as [[Beechams]], the [[United Alkali Company|Gamble Alkali Works]], [[Ravenhead Glass]], United Glass Bottles (UGB), Triplex, Daglish Foundry, [[Greenall's]] brewery, the glass producer Pilkington is the town's only remaining large industrial employer.<ref name="Ravenhead">{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmhansrd/vo010329/debtext/10329-28.htm |title=Ravenheads cause taken to Parliament, 2001|author=House of Commons report|publisher=parliament.uk}}</ref><ref name="Daglish">{{cite web |url=http://daglishfamily.blogspot.com/2007/04/daglish-foundry-st-helens.html |title=The Daglish Foundry, St. Helens|author=Stephen Daglish|date=14 April 2007|publisher=daglishfamily.blogspot.com}}</ref>{{refn|<ref name="coalsalt">{{cite book |author1=Barker, T.C. |author2=Harris, J.R. |name-list-style=amp | title=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900| publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=1994 | pages=3–11 | isbn=0-7146-4555-9}}</ref><ref name="ExTerraLucem">{{cite web|url=http://www.sthelenschoralsociety.org/aboutus/sthelens-history.aspx|title=Origin of St. Helens|author=St. Helens Choral Society|publisher=sthelenschoralsociety.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728055732/http://www.sthelenschoralsociety.org/aboutus/sthelens-history.aspx|archive-date=28 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Pilkington">{{cite book |author1=Barker, T.C. |author2=Harris, J.R. |name-list-style=amp | title=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900| publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=108–120 | isbn=0-7146-4555-9}}</ref><ref name="Pilkington2">{{cite book |author1=Barker, T.C. |author2=Harris, J.R. |name-list-style=amp | title=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900| publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=202–223 | isbn=0-7146-4555-9}}</ref><ref name="otherind">{{cite book |author1=Barker, T.C. |author2=Harris, J.R. |name-list-style=amp | title=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900| publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=120–131 | isbn=0-7146-4555-9}}</ref><ref name="copper2">{{cite book |author1=Barker, T.C. |author2=Harris, J.R. |name-list-style=amp | title=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900| publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=223–246 | isbn=0-7146-4555-9}}</ref><ref name="copper1">{{cite book |author1=Barker, T.C. |author2=Harris, J.R. |name-list-style=amp | title=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900| publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=75–90 | isbn=0-7146-4555-9}}</ref><ref name=copper3>{{cite book | author=Head, George | title=A home tour through the manufacturing districts of England, in the summer of 1835| url=https://archive.org/details/ahometourthroug02headgoog | publisher=Harper & Brothers | year=1836 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/ahometourthroug02headgoog/page/n84 78]–83}}</ref><ref name="Greenalls">{{cite book |author1=Barker, T.C. |author2=Harris, J.R. |name-list-style=amp | title=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900| publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=90–108 | isbn=0-7146-4555-9}}</ref>}}

==History==
{{main|History of St Helens, Merseyside}}

===Pre-history===
The southern part of what became the traditional county of Lancashire was at least partially settled by the [[Brigantes]], a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe, who were subjugated by the Romans during their [[Roman conquest of Britain|1st Century conquest]], with nearby [[Wigan]] suggested as a location for the Roman settlement of Coccium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#Celtic |title=Celtic Wigan |author=Wigan Archaeological Society|publisher=wiganarchsoc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wigan.romannw.com/ |title=Roman Wigan |author=Wigan Archaeological Society|publisher=wiganarchsoc.co.uk}}</ref> [[Eccleston, St Helens|Eccleston]] in St Helens appears to derive its name from either the Latin ''ecclesia'' or the Brittonic ''eglwys'', both meaning "church", suggesting a common link to a place of worship although none is known in that township until the 19th century.<ref name=eccleston/>

The first recorded settlements are the Manors, Parishes and Titled Lands listed in the [[Domesday Book]] in the 11th century. The titled lands would have encompassed the modern townships of Sutton, Windle and Parr as part of their fiefdoms, though it may be inferred from the listed [[tithes]] that the land was populated before then.<ref name=sutton/><ref name=windle/><ref name=parr/>

Between 1629 and 1839, St Helens grew from a small collection of houses surrounding an old chapel,<ref name=martindale/> to a village,<ref name=windle/><ref name=penny/> before becoming the significant urban centre of the four primary manors and surrounding townships that make up the modern town.<ref name=Samuel/><ref name=penny/><ref name=Wilson/><ref name=fletcher>{{cite book | author=Fletcher, Mike| title=Black Gold and Hot Sand: A History of St. Helens | publisher=Carnegie Publishing Ltd| year=2002 | isbn=978-1-85936-088-0}}</ref><ref name=Sankey/>

The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 reveals that several manors existed at that time, although there are no specific references to "St Elyn", or mentions of the particular "vill" or villages. [[Windle, St Helens|Windle]] is first recorded on some maps as "Windhull" (or variations thereof) in 1201,<ref name=windle/> [[Bold, St Helens|Bold]] in 1212 (as Bolde)<ref name=bold>{{cite book |author1=Farrer, William  |author2=Brownbill, J   |name-list-style=amp | title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 | publisher=Victoria County History | year=1907 |pages=402–409 }} The Section dedicated to Bold.</ref> and Parr (or Parre) in 1246,<ref name=parr>{{cite book |author1=Farrer, William  |author2=Brownbill, J   |name-list-style=amp | title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 | publisher=Victoria County History | year=1907 |pages=377–382 }} The Section dedicated to Parr.</ref> whilst Sutton<ref name=sutton>{{cite book |author1=Farrer, William  |author2=Brownbill, J   |name-list-style=amp | title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 | publisher=Victoria County History | year=1907 |pages=354–362 }} The Section dedicated to Sutton.</ref> and [[Eccleston, Merseyside|Ecclestone]]<ref name=eccleston>{{cite book |author1=Farrer, William  |author2=Brownbill, J   |name-list-style=amp | title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 | publisher=Victoria County History | year=1907 |pages=362–367 }} The Section dedicated to Eccleston.</ref> composed part of the Widnes "[[Fief|fee]]" (a hereditary entitlement of ownership) under a Knight or Earl.<ref name=sutton/> It is known that the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]] held lands in the area of Hardshaw as early as 1292, known as Crossgate<ref name=sutton/><ref name=windle/> (which may be referred to by the long built-over Cross Street in the town centre beneath the modern College campus) and many of the original parishes, townships and local areas are named after the families that owned the land between the 11th and 18th centuries.<ref name=sutton/><ref name=fletcher/>

The Ecclestone family owned the Eccleston township.<ref name=fletcher/> Their ancestral home dates to 1100; it was built by Hugh Ecclestone. The family is referred to throughout the period until the 18th century when they departed for nearby [[Southport]].<ref name=fines>{{cite book | author=Farrer, William  | title=Final Concords for Lancashire, Part 4: 1509–1558 | publisher=Victoria County History | year=1910}}</ref>

The manor of [[Parr, St Helens|Parr]] remained in control of the Parr family and their descendants from the 13th to the early 15th century when a distant relative of the original family line, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton]] (brother of Henry VIII's wife Catherine Parr) sold the manor to the Byroms of [[Lowton]].<ref name=fletcher/> The family later supported the Royalists during the [[English Civil War]], and Henry Byrom (son of the Lord of the Manor) died at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref name=lowton>{{cite book |author1=Farrer, William  |author2=Brownbill, J   |name-list-style=amp | title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 | publisher=Victoria County History | year=1911 |pages=150–154 }} The Section dedicated to the Byroms.</ref>

The extensive lands of Sutton Manor stretched across the open and flat land leading towards the Mersey. The manor's name is of unknown origin, but the land within the estate referred to several leading families, including Eltonhead, Ravenhead, and Sherdley.<ref name=fletcher/> In 1212, William de Daresbury was the title holder of the manors.<ref name=sutton/> The Sherdley family can be traced back to the Northales, who had been settled in the area since at least 1276 when they were referred to as plaintiffs in a boundary dispute with the Lords of Rainhill.<ref name=sutton/>

Windle contained the smaller Hardshaw, described as a [[wikt:berewick|berewick]]<ref name=fletcher/> in the Domesday Book. It was in Hardshaw that Chapel Lane was constructed. The Windle Family were Lords of the Manor and Township from the Norman period onward before ceding control to the Gerards of [[Bryn, Greater Manchester|Bryn]].<ref name=fletcher/>

{{cquote|''"This tiny hamlet [in] Hardshaw including the chapel-of-ease, from which its name was taken, became the nucleus of the town."''|author=Mike Fletcher|source=Black Gold & Hot Sand, 2002<ref name=fletcher/>}}

In 1139, the [[Earl of Derby|earldom of Derby]], in the [[Peerage of England]], was created: Norman descendant [[Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby|Robert De Ferrers]] was the first Earl. Subsequently, the region passed to [[John of Gaunt]], and eventually the [[Audley-Stanley family|Stanley]] family. Their ancestral home was eventually established in the nearby [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]] area (to the west of the modern St Helens borough), with the foundation of a hunting lodge in the 15th century and subsequently [[Knowsley Hall]] in the 18th century. The Earl of Derby's lands encompassed a region from Liverpool to Manchester, and to the north beyond [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and were primarily turned to meeting the pastoral needs of the people.<ref name=sutton/><ref name=windle/>

Throughout this period, the area was predominantly arable land<ref name="coalsalt"/><ref name=windle/> and was noted for its large swathes of moss, heath and [[peat bog|bog land]] while elsewhere in parts, it was covered by the greater Mersey Forest<ref name="coalsalt"/> (the larger [[Mersey Forest|"Community Forest"]] was not established until much later).<ref name="population">{{cite web |url=http://www.merseyforest.org.uk/pages/us.asp|title=The Mersey Forest overview|author=The Mersey Forest|publisher=merseyforest.org.uk}}</ref>

The origin of the name "St Helens" stretches back at least to a [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to St Elyn,<ref name=windle>{{cite book |author1=Farrer, William  |author2=Brownbill, J   |name-list-style=amp | title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 | publisher=Victoria County History | year=1907 |pages=371–377 }} The Section dedicated to Windle.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sthelensparishchurch.org/history.html|title=The history of St Helens Parish Church|author=St Helens Parish Church|publisher=sthelensparishchurch.org|access-date=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114144453/http://www.sthelensparishchurch.org/history.html|archive-date=14 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the earliest documented reference to which is in 1552.<ref name="coalsalt"/><ref name=windle/> The first time the chapel was formally referred to appears to be 1558, when Thomas Parr of [[Parr, St Helens|Parr]] bequeathed a sum of money "to a stock towards finding a priest at St. Helen's Chapel in Hardshaw, and to the maintenance of God's divine service there for ever, if the stock go forward and that the priest do service as is aforesaid".<ref name=windle/> Early maps show that it was originally in Chapel Lane, near the site of the modern pedestrianised Church Street. Historically this would have fallen within the [[wikt:berewick|berewick]] of Hardshaw, within the greater township of Windle (making up the southern border)<ref name=penny>{{cite book | editor=Long, George | title=The Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volumes 13-14 | publisher=Charles Knight & Penny Magazine | year=1839 }}</ref><ref name=fletcher/> abutting onto the open farmland of Parr to the east, and [[Sutton, Merseyside|Sutton]] and Eccleston to the south and west respectively.

In 1552, the Chapel of St Elyn was noted as "consisting only of a [[chalice|challis]] and a lytle bell".<ref name="coalsalt"/> The chapel was described as being at the crux of the four townships of Eccleston, Parr, Sutton and Windle,<ref name="coalsalt"/> and lay on the intersecting roads that criss-crossed the area and linked Lancashire towns such as [[Liverpool]], [[Ormskirk]], [[Lathom]]<ref name="coalsalt"/> and the [[Cheshire]] region south of the [[River Mersey]].<ref name=windle/> The transport link is attested to by the existence of Chester Lane (the modern B5419 is much foreshortened) that originally wound through the west of the town heading south to the Mersey crossing point of [[Warrington]]<ref name=windle/> and beyond to the ancient Chester Road (that now makes up part of the modern A56) that stretched between the historic [[Chester|town of its name]] and the [[Manchester]] townships.<ref name=windle/> The chapel also sat directly between the port town of Liverpool, and the landlocked Manchester townships that would become important in the development of the greater area of both St Helens and [[Wigan]].<ref name="coalsalt"/>

As a busy thoroughfare it is suggested by historian and genealogist William Farrer that a village existed in the vicinity for centuries,<ref name=windle/> later sharing the name of the chapel. It is known from the diaries of a local [[Puritan]] by the name of [[Adam Martindale]]<ref name=martindale>{{cite book | author=Martindale, A  | title=The Life of Adam Martindale, Written By Himself | publisher=Chetham Society, from manuscript in the British Museum | year=1845 }}</ref> that by the time the King's Head Inn was constructed in 1629 on "the great road" (taken to refer to all or part of Chester Lane) between Warrington and Ormskirk, a number of houses, farms and manors counted amongst the properties in the local vicinity and general area.<ref name=windle/>  Martindale notes that by 1618 that the original chapel had been demolished and rebuilt<ref name=martindale/> in the same vicinity. In 1678 a building was converted for use as a meeting place for the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]] by George Shaw of Bickerstaffe. Local historians believe the building had been used for another purpose long before 1678. The Quaker Friends' Meeting House, as it is now known, is a Grade II [[listed building]].

The strong link to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in the area was maintained throughout this period by the eventual Lords of Sutton Manor, the De Holland family, starting in 1321.<ref name=sutton/> Thomas Holland, a local Jesuit priest, was arrested and tried for [[high treason]] in October 1642 as "taking orders by authority of the [[Holy See|see of Rome]] and returning to England". The first step toward his [[beatification]] was allowed by Pope Leo XIII in 1886.<ref name=sutton/> Conversely Roger Holland was [[Death by burning|burnt at the stake]] for heresy when he continued his professed belief in the [[Reformed churches]] some 100 years earlier in 1558 during the persecution of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].<ref name=sutton/> It is suggested that Ravenhead Hall was the site of a Catholic chapel during the most severe of Catholic persecutions during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=sutton/> Whilst the Lathom family maintained Rainfords close connections, as did the Ecclestons.<ref name=eccleston/><ref name=sutton/>

Less well-known is the Windle connection to witches. In 1602, two women were sent to Lancaster for trial, while a decade later [[Isobel Roby]] was submitted to [[Thomas Gerard, 1st Baron Gerard|Sir Thomas Gerard]], accused of upsetting the ship upon which [[James VI and I]]'s Queen Consort [[Anne of Denmark]] was arriving. Roby was finally executed at [[Lancaster Castle|Lancaster]], along with the Pendle and Salmesburg witches, on 20 August 1612.

By 1746, St Helens, composed of the greater area of the four townships (and their collieries) beyond [[Prescot]], was referred to in a statement in Parliament related to the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.<ref name=Sankey/>

The rapid growth of St Helens at the centre of the townships is attested to by several authors. The ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'' states in 1839 that "Saint Helen's, Lancashire, is in the township of Windle, in the chapelry of St Helen's, Prescott parish. The township contains {{convert|3540|acres|ha|abbr=off}}, and had in 1831 a population of 5,825. The town has risen into importance of late years"<ref name=penny/> In contrast by 1844 (30 years before the borough of St Helens was established) Cyrus Redding mentions a reversal of the roles: "St Helens, originally an inconsiderable village, is now a very thriving town"; and he later states that the town "...&nbsp;may be said to contain the four townships of Sutton, Parr, Windle and Eccleston".<ref name=pictorallancs>{{cite book | author=Cyrus Redding | title=Pictorial History of the County of Lancaster | url=https://archive.org/details/pictorialhistor00unkngoog | publisher=George Routledge | year=1844| pages=[https://archive.org/details/pictorialhistor00unkngoog/page/n111 89]–137}}</ref> The composition of the town described by Redding largely mirrors those observations made by Samuel Lewis in 1848<ref name=Samuel/> and later still in 1874 by [[John Marius Wilson]]<ref name=Wilson>{{cite book | author=Wilson, John Marius | title=Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–1872) | publisher=A.

The original Town Hall was constructed in 1839 and described by Wilson in 1874 as "in the Italian style, with a Corinthian portico; and contains a lock-up, a newsroom, and a large hall for courts, concerts, balls, and public meetings".<ref name=Wilson/> It was not until 1852 that the Civil Parish of St Helens was instituted (noted in 1874 by Wilson as "more extensive than the town"<ref name=Wilson/>). The [[Mill Street Barracks]] were completed in 1861.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/ta-meeting-place-restored-former-4801120 |title=TA meeting place restored to former glory|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=1 July 2013|access-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>

On 2 February 1868, Queen Victoria granted a Charter of Incorporation, defining St Helens officially as a Municipal Borough. The first election of Councillors took place on 9 May the same year, followed by the first Town Council meeting on 18 May.<ref name=Wilson/> About 20 years later in 1887 St Helens became a [[Parliamentary Borough|County Borough]], with two Members of Parliament.<ref name="bartholemew"/>

In 1894, the Parish of St Helens was incorporated under the 1893 St Helens Corporation Act.<ref name="CivilParish"/><ref name=CountyBorough>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10027329|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121224105718/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10027329|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-24|title=Administrative unit St Helens MB/CB|author=University of Portsmouth|publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref> This was achieved by the abolition of the Civil Parishes of [[Parr, St Helens|Parr]], [[Sutton, Merseyside|Sutton]] and amalgamation of their townships.

The modern Borough of St Helens includes areas historically not associated with the town. The 1974 creation of the Ceremonial County of [[Merseyside]] appended the former [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of [[Haydock]], [[Newton-le-Willows]] and [[Rainford]], and parts of [[Billinge and Winstanley Urban District|Billinge-and-Winstanley]] and [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]] urban districts, along with part of [[Whiston Rural District]], all from the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Lancashire]]. The urban sprawl of St Helens was already extended up to the boundary lines of places such as Haydock and Rainhill, where inhabitants may consider themselves either part of either both St Helens the 'Town' or 'Borough', or just the Borough.

===Industrial development===

Until the mid-18th century, the local industry was almost entirely based on small-scale home-based initiatives such as linen weaving.<ref name="coalsalt"/> The landscape was dotted with similarly small-scale excavation and mining operations, primarily for clay and peat, but also notably for coal. It is the coal to which the town owes both its initial growth and development<ref name="coalsalt"/> and the subsequent development of the coal-dependent industries of copper smelting and glass.

Sitting on the [[South Lancashire Coalfield]], the town was built both physically and metaphorically on [[coal mining|coal]]; the original motto in the borough council's coat of arms was "''Ex Terra Lucem''" ("From the Ground, Light")<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/6911795.stm |title=Public art project for M62 site |publisher=BBC Online |date=23 July 2007 |access-date=27 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://economicdevelopment.sthelens.gov.uk/site.do?id=245|title=The Channel 4 Big Art Project in St.Helens|publisher=St.Helens Council|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213010826/http://economicdevelopment.sthelens.gov.uk/site.do?id=245|archive-date=13 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigartsthelens.com/big-art-sthelens-sutton-manor/ |title= Channel 4 Big Art Project; THE SUTTON MANOR COLLIERY SITE|publisher=Big Art St. Helens | access-date=23 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416094445/http://www.bigartsthelens.com/big-art-sthelens-sutton-manor|archive-date=16 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/4555503.Let_there_be_light_on_St_Helens__Dream__say_ex_miners/ | title=Let there be light on St Helens' Dream, say ex-miners |editor-first=Andrew|editor-last=Kilmurray|date=20 August 2009|access-date=23 May 2010}}</ref> and local collieries employed up to 5,000 men as late as the 1970s. During the boom years of the British coal industry (1913 was the peak year of production, with 1 million employed in UK mining industry) the St Helens division of the [[Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation]] (the local miners' union) had the largest membership (10%) of that federation.<ref name="coalsalt"/>

The discovery of winnable coal seams is mentioned in 1556, referred to as "Beds of cinders or coke&nbsp;... have been discovered three feet thick"<ref name=sutton/> during the digging of a clay pit<ref name=fletcher/> and is commonly attributed to the Eltonhead family (Elton Head Road, the modern B5204, shares the name of the family) whilst reference to the significant distribution of "[[sherd|potsherds]]"<ref name=sutton/> during excavation suggests that some light industry had been underway for some time before (perhaps as far back as the 13th century) and the clay and pottery industries lasted in the area through to the early 20th century.<ref name=eccleston/><ref name=sutton/> A dispute arose between the landlord Bolds and the tenant Eltonheads, eventually resulting in an agreement to compensate the Bold family.<ref name=sutton/><ref name=fletcher/>

The majority of the land had been turned over to arable farming since at least the 12th century, according to the historical family records of William De Daresbury. The township of Sutton was recorded as "by itself being assessed at four plough-lands".<ref name=sutton/> Plow or ploughlands are assessed at {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}} apiece.<ref name=plow>{{cite book | last=Cohen | first=Yehudi A. | title=Man in adaptation: the cultural present | publisher=Chicago, Aldine Pub.

Two hundred years earlier, Farrer may well have seen a different sight: St Helens was scarred and pitted by shallow mining operations, often quickly abandoned, left to flood and exceedingly prone to collapse. The primitive mining techniques, and limited ability to bail out gathering water, meant many pits had short lifespans. Complaints are recorded in Sutton Heath in particular about the plans to expand mining across the town, but the lure of a stable income ultimately won out against the objections.<ref name=fletcher/> 100 years later, the Council rejected a planning application for an open cast mine — underlining the finality of the decline of coal mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sthelensreporter.co.uk/st-helens-news/Neighbours-fight-opencast-mine-plans.5389743.jp |title=Neighbours fight opencast mine plans |publisher=The Reporter|location=St Helens |date=22 June 2009 |access-date=1 August 2010}}</ref>

In the 18th century, however, coal was an enabling force for the town that opened up opportunities for further commercial and industrial developments,<ref name="otherind"/> which in turn drove demand for the rapid movement of raw goods not simply out of the town (coal to Liverpool to fuel its shipping and steel works for instance, but also its salt works<ref name=fletcher/>) but also in promoting an influx of raw products for processing. The dependence of St Helens on its transport links is evident from claims made to Parliament in 1746 for maintenance and extension of the turnpike road after local flooding had damaged it.<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=Sankey/>

{{cquote|''"because Prescot, being Three Miles nearer to Liverpoole than St Helens, Persons will naturally go to the former Place for Coals, if they can be supplied as well and as cheap there as at the latter"''|author=T.C. Barker quoting Witness John Eyes|source=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750–1900<ref name=Sankey/>}}

It is clear that St Helens' development owes as much to its location on the south [[List of collieries in Lancashire since 1854|Lancashire Coalfield]] as it does the fact that Liverpool, Chester and other centres of industry were not, and yearned for the fossil fuel of choice.<ref name=fletcher/>

It was essential therefore for the town to maintain, and invest further in, transport links and promote itself as a hub for the growth of Liverpool, with its provision of raw materials benefiting from its location and promising transport links. Liverpool, recognising the need for a ready supply of coal for its forges, responded with a petition for the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.<ref name=Sankey/> This soon developed into a far more forward thinking development which was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution: canals.

It was originally proposed merely to make the Sankey Brook navigable, but the eventual outcome was a complete man-made canal linking St Helens to the River Mersey and the city of Liverpool. The [[Sankey Canal]] was opened in 1757, and extended in 1775, to transport coal from the pits in [[Ravenhead]], [[Haydock]] and Parr to Liverpool, and for raw materials to be shipped to St Helens.

The transport revolution centred on the region encouraged an influx of industry to the hitherto sparsely populated area. With industry came job opportunities and population growth. Between 1700 St Helens grew from a sparsely populated array of manor houses and their tenants into a sprawling span of mining operations.<ref name=eccleston/><ref name=Sankey/>

Owing primarily to the abundance of coal reserves, the quality of local sand, and the availability of salt in nearby Cheshire,<ref name="coalsalt"/> glass making is known to have been ongoing in the Sutton area since at least 1688, when the Frenchman John Leaf Snr is recorded as paying the Eltonhead family £50 for a lease of 2½ acres (1 hectare) of Sutton's Lower Hey. The glass industry got a significant lift with the Crown-authorised "British Cast Plate Glass Company" established in Ravenhead in 1786;<ref name="Pilkington"/><ref name="Pilkington2"/> it latched onto the success of similar enterprises to set the region as the market leader for glass.

The foundation of the companies owed as much to industrial leaders from outside the town (and the finance they provided) as to its natural resources but the synchronous development of the steam engine was a significant development, with [[James Watt]]'s stationary steam engine design leading the way. Water could be pumped from deeper than ever before, and mines could be driven to find even more dense seams.<ref name=fletcher/> At the same time, the growth in use of machinery (e.g. for mills, forges, and ships) rapidly increased the demand for coal - to which the town responded.<ref name=fletcher/>

Land exchanged hands in St Helens rapidly, as established families moved out of the growing towns filled with the working classes to more gentrified and less industrially developed places. In their place came self-made wealthy industrialists such as John Mackay (who first leased land in St Helens in the 1760s from [[King George III]] before buying the land constituting Ravenhead Farm from the Archbishop of York), Michael Hughes, the Gambles, and later Thomas Beecham, Thomas Greenall and the Pilkingtons.<ref name="copper2"/><ref name=fletcher/> A few established families remained, such as the Gerards of Windle Hall. They made their land available for industrial use.<ref name=fletcher/>

{{cquote|''"if any&nbsp;... good colliers&nbsp;... will apply at Thatto Heath Colliery, they will meet with constant employ and the best encouragement."''|author=Mike Fletcher quoting John Mackay|source=Black Gold & Hot Sand, 200<ref name=fletcher/>}}

One of the first major industries to grow out of the transport innovations in the region was copper smelting.<ref name="copper2"/> The [[Parys Mountain|Parys]] mining company, led by Michael Hughes, leased land from John Mackay close to the newly constructed Sankey Canal at Ravenhead (where Ravenhead Colliery had since been established).<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=Sankey/> This allowed copper ore carried from the Parys Mountain mine in [[Amlwch]] in [[Anglesey]], North Wales to arrive in the St Helens region via the Mersey directly at the point where coal was being excavated to fire the forges of industry. Some 10,000 tons of copper ore yielding over 1,300 tons of copper passed along this route.<ref name="copper2"/><ref name="copper1"/> At the same time the Gerards were renting out land in Blackbrook to Patten & Co. from nearby Warrington.<ref name="journaltransport">{{cite book | title=The Journal of Transport History, Volumes 2-3 | publisher=Manchester University Press | year=1955 |pages=175–176}}</ref> The company smelted using the Gerards 'own coal, then moved the coal downstream from a private wharf on the navigable brook.<ref name=fletcher/><ref name="journaltransport"/>

The boom did not last: by 1783, coal industry leaders such as Mackay, Sarah Clayton and Thomas Case were all dead, penniless or both as a global constriction on coal shipments stifled the industry. An over-reliance on shipping to the USA during the [[American War of Independence]] (1775–1783) ruined many people, and led to the permanent loss of several smaller industries.<ref name=fletcher/> It took partnership and coordination with other industries for the mining industry to recover; with the US embargo lifted, the town's troubles were soon overcome if not forgotten, although this was not the last troubling incident.<ref name=fletcher/>

The demand for chemicals such as alkali from the glass industry soon led the Gamble family to start their lime and alkali pits, saving on import costs. The growing demand for chemical processing also contributed heavily to the growth of [[Widnes]].

The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] opened in 1830. It passed through the southern edge of the town at Rainhill and St Helens Junction, and furthered its economic development as a centre of industry.<ref name="coalsalt"/>

===The decline of the mining industry===
The last coal mine located close to the town centre (Ravenhead Colliery) and those located in the outlying districts of St Helens, including those that were just outside the original 1887 County Borough boundary, such as Clock Face (Clock Face Colliery), Sutton (Bold Colliery), Sutton Heath (Lea Green Colliery), Sutton Manor (Sutton Manor Colliery) and Haydock (Lyme Pit, Wood Pit, Old Boston), were all closed between the nationalisation of the deep coal mining industry in 1947 and 24 May 1991, when Sutton Manor Colliery, the last to go in the immediate St Helens area, finally closed its gates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/coal-mining-in-the-british-isles/lancashire-coalfield/st-helens-coalfield/sutton-manor-colliery-1906-1991/|title=Sutton Manor Colliery (1906-1991)|website=Nmrs.org}}</ref>

The coal mining industry in St Helens and elsewhere had collapsed because the government maintained that the deep mining of coal was no longer an economically viable proposition in most British coalfields. The closures were opposed by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] during the year-long [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|Miners' Strike]] of 1984–85. After the collapse of the miners' strike in March 1985, St Helens was just one of dozens of towns in the UK that was immediately set to lose a long-standing employer. In the case of both Sutton Manor and Bold Collieries, it was estimated by some that when they were closed they each still had up to 40 years of winnable coal reserves.<ref name=CoalHistory>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/02/23/miners_gary_conley_feature.shtml |title=A choice between head and heart|first=Paul|last=Coslett |publisher=BBC Online |date=23 February 2009 |access-date=21 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="SuttonBeauty">{{cite web |url=http://www.suttonbeauty.org.uk/beauty/manorwoodlands/ |title=Sutton Manor Woodland in St. Helens |publisher=Sutton Beauty |access-date=21 June 2010}}</ref> The last colliery in the modern [[metropolitan borough]], and in the St Helens area of the South Lancashire Coalfield, was Parkside, in [[Newton-le-Willows]], which was closed in 1993.

==Economy==

The glass industry is no longer the major employer it once was; however, it still employs over a thousand people in the town.<ref>Taken from [http://www.culture.gov.uk/Cap/proposals/St_Helens.pdf St Helens Casino Bid Background Information 1.4.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205173030/http://www.culture.gov.uk/cap/proposals/St_Helens.pdf |date=5 February 2007 }}</ref> The large [[Pilkington Glass|Pilkington Brothers]] works, founded in 1826, dominates the town's industrial quarter and still produces all the UK's output of flat glass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolcityregion.uk/main-associations-in-st-helens.html|title=Main Associations in St. Helens - Liverpool City Region {{!}} Liverpool {{!}} Wirral {{!}} Sefton {{!}} St. Helens {{!}} Knowsley {{!}} Halton|website=Liverpoolcityregion.uk|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>

In 1994, planning permission was sought out for a link road connecting the M62 directly with the town centre.<ref name=planningravenhead>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/29sep94-uk-planning-st-helens-merseyside-burtonhead-road-m62-link-road/986292.article|title=29Sep94 UK: PLANNING - ST.

===Retail===
[[File:ApproachingSt Helens.jpg|right|thumb|The view into the Town Centre, with Beechams Clock Tower in view.]]
The town's shopping area is centred on the [[St Helen's Church, St Helens, Merseyside|parish church of St Helens]], the original site of St Mary's open market. The open market was later replaced by an awned covered market that populated Chapel Lane and the locale.

The current Church Square shopping centre surrounds St Helens on three sides. Church Street, the main high street, runs parallel to Church Square and is sandwiched by the town's second shopping centre known as The Hardshaw Centre. The other main shopping streets in the town centre include the more traditional small store based Bridge Street, Duke Street and Westfield Street populated by independent specialists. Church Square was bought by [[St Helens Borough Council]] in 2017 for £26.6m as part of local regeneration plans.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Council|first=St Helens|title=St.Helens Council|url=https://www.sthelens.gov.uk/news/2017/october/27/st-helens-council-announces-its-purchase-of-church-square-shopping-centre/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=Sthelens.gov.uk}}</ref>

The town centre has several supermarkets including mainstream stores such as [[Asda]] and [[Tesco]], as well as smaller stores such as [[Lidl]]. [[Morrisons]] retain two stores located in the Eccleston and Sutton areas of the town. There is also a Tesco superstore in Earlestown, which is on a former Safeway site and many smaller Tesco Express and Tesco Metro stores. A new Tesco Extra store opened in October 2011 on the outskirts of the town centre to replace the existing Chalon Way superstore, which has now been taken over by new retail Home & Leisure outlet, [[The Range Home and Leisure|The Range]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heroes gather for new store's grand opening|url=https://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/9335575.heroes-gather-for-tescos-grand-opening/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=St Helens Star|date=31 October 2011 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=New store will bring 150 jobs to St Helens|url=https://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/9746411.new-store-for-the-range-on-former-tesco-site-will-create-150-new-jobs-in-st-helens/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=St Helens Star|date=6 June 2012 |language=en}}</ref>

St Helens has two major retail parks, one on either side of the St Helens Linkway. The older of these, St Helens Retail Park, is home to several discount stores and wholesale retailers.

The larger Ravenhead Retail Park houses more large-scale mainstream retail stores, and a number of restaurants, fast food outlets and cafes. The same area (in particular the old United Glass Bottles site) has been used for development of the new St Helens RLFC stadium and the construction of a Tesco Extra supermarket, to replace the smaller Tesco supermarket in the town centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sthelensstadium.com/pages/vision.htm |title=Langtree Group plc - St Helens Stadium - Vision |publisher=Sthelensstadium.com |access-date=3 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724165250/http://www.sthelensstadium.com/pages/vision.htm |archive-date=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> At 140,000 square metres, this [[Tesco]] Extra store is one of the biggest in England<ref>[[Tesco]]</ref>

===Historic and notable buildings===
{{main|Listed buildings in St Helens, Merseyside}}
[[File:St Helens Town Hall pre-fire.jpg|right|thumb|A period postcard of the new (and current) Town Hall as it would have appeared in 1876.]]
[[File:St. Helens friendship meeting house.jpg|right|thumb| An artists rendition of the Quaker Friends' Meeting House, a Grade II listed building.]]
'''[[St Helens Town Hall]]''' built in 1876 to replace the original (damaged by a fire in 1871); its clock tower originally had a steeple but this was destroyed in a fire in 1913.

In the centre of the modern town centre, adjacent to the town hall, is '''the Gamble Institute''', built in 1896 and named after Sir David Gamble, who was the first mayor and who also gifted the land for the building. Today, the Gamble Institute building serves as the central library and also houses other municipal offices and archives.

Other buildings of note are:

'''The Friends' Meeting House''', Church Street. This attractive stone-built Grade II [[Listed building|listed]] hall has been used for Quaker worship for over 300 years since its establishment, in 1678, by George Shaw of Bickerstaffe. A sign at the front of the building reads "so used" since 1678, partly leading local historians to believe the building had been used for another purpose for quite a number of years before 1678. The building and garden have been recently restored and are an important element of the George Street Conservation Area. The [[sundial]] over the door of the meeting house is dated 1753, while a curiosity in the garden is a huge glacial boulder, said to have been deposited from the Lake District following the last ice age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitsthelens.com/site/culture-and-heritage/friends-meeting-house-p46927|title=Friends Meeting House|publisher=St Helens Borough Council}}</ref>

'''The Beecham Clock Tower''', Westfield Street - which is now part of St Helens College. This was the original headquarters of the Beecham pharmaceutical empire.

'''[[St Mary's Lowe House Catholic Church]]''', North Road is a Grade II listed building, opened in 1929, the second on this site (the land having been donated by Winifred Gorsuch Lowe - hence the name 'Lowe House'). The church is an unusual and striking landmark with a {{convert|130|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower and a dome of a mixed [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. The major feature is the historic Carillon<ref name=carillon>{{cite web|url=http://www.carillons.org/sthelens/|title=St Mary's Lowe House Carillion|publisher=British Carillon Society|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120170102/http://www.carillons.org/sthelens/|archive-date=20 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (bells playable using a keyboard, rather than by pulling ropes). It is the largest in the North West of England, housing 47 bells.<ref name=carillon/>

'''The Roman Catholic Church of St Anne and Blessed Dominic''', Monastery Road, Sutton, is a pilgrimage site for Roman Catholics. The Victorian missionary Blessed [[Dominic Barberi]] is buried in the church. Alongside Blessed Dominic, Father [[Ignatius Spencer]] is buried. The son of the 2nd [[Spencer family|Earl Spencer]], he was a famed convert to the Roman Catholic faith. [[Elizabeth Prout]], foundress of the religious order, the [[Sisters of the Cross and Passion]], is also buried with them.

==Geography==
[[File:Billinge Hill.jpg|right|thumb|[[Billinge Hill]] is the highest point in St Helens and Merseyside]]

The [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens Borough]] covers roughly {{convert|30|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of soft rolling hills used primarily for [[agricultural]] purposes, mainly [[arable land|arable]]. The highest point in the borough, and in the whole of Merseyside, is [[Billinge Hill]], {{convert|4+1/2|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the town centre. From the top of this hill the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] are visible on a clear day, as well as the towns of [[Wigan]], [[Bolton]] and [[Warrington]]. The Mill Brook/Windle Brook runs through Eccleston and connects with the disused St Helens branch/section of the [[Sankey Canal]] in the town centre. St Helens is around {{convert|160|ft|m|-1|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

[[Carr Mill Dam]] is Merseyside's largest body of inland water, with lakeside trails and walks. It is used for national competitive powerboating and angling events.

Moss Bank, a suburb of St Helens, is about {{convert|4|km|mi|frac=2|abbr=on}} north of the town centre. It has a community library and St David's
church.
 
[[The Burgies]] are two [[tailings]] on the site of the old Rushy Park coal mine. They were created by dumping toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass; they have since been covered with tall grass and woodland.

St Helens was struck by [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi|title = European Severe Weather Database|website=Eswd.eu}}</ref> Damage from the tornado occurred in St Helens town centre.

===Location===
[[File:St Helens 07.07R edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|St Helens viewed looking south-west in 2007. The town centre is in the centre and the Linkway runs to the top, [[Sherdley Park]] is top left and [[Pilkington]]'s Cowley Hill works is bottom centre.]]

St Helens is located {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the east of Liverpool and {{convert|23|mi|km}} from the centre of Manchester. The borough shares borders with the towns or boroughs of [[Prescot]] in [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], [[Skelmersdale]], [[Warrington]], [[Widnes]] and [[Wigan]]; it has direct transport links by road and two main railway lines. Its centralised location has formed the basis of the local authority's promotional literature.<ref name=heartofnorthwest/>

The town is considered part of the [[Liverpool Urban Area]] for ONS purposes.<ref name="Census2001">{{cite web |author=Census 2001 |title=Census 2001 Key Statistics, Urban areas in England and Wales |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/index.html |publisher=ONS}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Road===
St Helens is well served by motorway links with the east–west corridors of the M58 and [[M62 motorway|M62]] to the north and south of the town. The town is also served by the parallel-running north–south routes of the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]] to the east and west.

The M6 runs a few miles to the eastern side of the town centre, with J23 at [[Haydock]] serving both northbound and southbound traffic and J24 at Ashton in Makerfield serving southbound exit and northbound access.

The [[M62 motorway|M62]] runs a couple of miles to the south of the town with J7 at [[Rainhill]] Stoops. The [[M57 motorway|M57]]'s J2 lies several miles south-west of St. Helens, at Prescot. The [[M58 motorway|M58]] is several miles north, at the north-western end of the A570 Rainford by-pass dual carriageway.

The [[A580 road|A580]] ''East Lancashire Road'' runs north of the town centre alongside Eccleston, [[Moss Bank]] and through [[Haydock]]. It is a dual-carriageway former trunk road taking traffic from [[Manchester]] to the Liverpool Docks. It was built between 1929 and 1934 and was opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. It was intended to take pressure away from the [[A58 road|A58]], a major road running from Prescot (M57) through St Helens to the [[A1(M)]] at [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]].

The Rainford by-pass is a section of the [[A570 road|A570]], between the East Lancashire Road and the M58; it is part of the transport route from [[Southport]], in [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], through west Lancashire and St Helens to the M62 J7 at Rainhill.

A major development in communication was the opening of the dual-carriageway ''St Helens Linkway'' (classified as part of the A570) in 1994, which linked the town centre directly with the M62 (at Rainhill). The [[A572 road|A572]] takes traffic from the town centre through Parr to [[Earlestown]] and [[Newton-le-Willows]]. In July 2020, the St Helens Linkway grass verge was chosen by St Helens Borough Council as a site on which to plant yellow flowers in a large heart shape, in memory of all who had died during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Council|first=St Helens|title=St.Helens Council|url=https://www.sthelens.gov.uk/news/2020/july/03/floral-tribute-for-those-who-died-of-covid-19-unveiled-in-st-helens-borough/|access-date=2020-07-04|website=Sthelens.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Grieving together with a yellow heart|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-52589050/coronavirus-grieving-together-with-a-yellow-heart|access-date=2020-07-04|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 2010, St Helens was proclaimed "UK's most car-friendly town" measured on variables such as "petrol prices, parking costs and the number of speed cameras in an assessment carried out by Virgin Money Car Insurance" in research conducted by ''The Independent'' newspaper.<ref name=virginmoney>{{cite news |title=London voted least car-friendly town | author= Peter Woodman |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 July 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-news/london-voted-least-carfriendly-town-2026230.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220524/https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-news/london-voted-least-carfriendly-town-2026230.html |archive-date=24 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Buses===
[[File:StHelensBus.jpg|right|thumb|A St Helens Corporation liveried bus in 1968, in front of the Town Hall]]
[[File:Tecnobus Pantheon 1.jpg|right|thumb|Battery-electric minibus in St Helens]]

Bus services to Wigan (320, 352), Liverpool, Widnes and Warrington operate from the town centre. St Helens has a central bus station that sits between Bickerstaffe Street and Corporation Street. A [[Merseytravel]] office is located on Bickerstaffe Street, where bus passes and advice can be sought.

From 1890, St Helens Corporation Transport organised public network services throughout the area, providing bus and trolleybus services. Following local government re-organisation in 1974, the [[Merseytravel|Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (Merseytravel) was expanded to cover St Helens. After privatisation in 1986, the town was served by several locally branded operations under the umbrella of [[MTL (transport company)|Merseyside Transport Limited]] (MTL), in which Merseytravel retained shares until 1993.

[[Arriva]] purchased MTL in 2000 and has operated the majority of the routes since. Several smaller operators run specific routes within the town area, such as [[Cumfybus]], Hattons, HTL Buses, Red Kite<ref name=redkite>{{cite web |url=http://www.redkitetravel.co.uk/ |title=Red Kite Homepage | publisher=Red Kite}}</ref> Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire and local [[Municipal bus company|municipal bus companies]]. There were also three [[zero-fare]] services operated by [[Battery electric vehicle|battery-electric minibuses]] in and around the town centre, ferrying passengers to nearby retail parks such as Ravenhead, which were provided on behalf of Merseytravel by [[Selwyns Travel]]. From 22 February 2014, these buses were withdrawn from service as part of a Merseytravel programme of spending cuts and due to the buses being at end of their operational lives.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?id=37108|title=Electric bus service axed in Merseytravel cutbacks|work=TransportXtra|date=7 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222162558/http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?id=37108|archive-date=22 February 2014}}</ref>

===Railway===
[[File:St Helens Central New Station.jpg|right|thumb|[[St Helens Central railway station|St Helens Central station]], which was rebuilt in 2007]]

[[St Helens Central railway station|St Helens Central]] station serves the town centre. The stations of [[Thatto Heath railway station|Thatto Heath]], [[Eccleston Park railway station|Eccleston Park]] and [[Garswood railway station|Garswood]] are on the [[Liverpool to Wigan Line]] that runs from [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]] to [[Wigan North Western railway station|Wigan North Western]].

The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway|Liverpool to Manchester]] line serves the St Helens area at [[Rainhill railway station|Rainhill]], [[Lea Green Railway Station|Lea Green]] and [[St Helens Junction railway station|St Helens Junction]] before passing on to [[Earlestown railway station|Earlestown]] and [[Newton-le-Willows railway station|Newton-le-Willows]]. The St Helens Junction and Rainhill buildings are two of the original stations that were built when the line opened in 1830.

Until the 1950s, three railway lines ran through St Helens:

* the current line from Liverpool Lime Street, through Huyton and St Helens, to Wigan North Western;
* a [[St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway|line]] from [[Widnes South railway station|Widnes]], through St Helens, to [[Rainford Junction railway station|Rainford]];
* a [[Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway|line]] starting at [[St Helens Central (GCR) railway station|St Helens]], running east through [[Haydock railway station|Haydock]], to {{rws|Lowton St Mary's}} on the LNER [[Wigan Junction Railways|Wigan Junction line]].

A major redevelopment of St Helens Central station was completed in 2007 at a cost of £6.2 million,<ref name=redevelopmentpdf /> which the council hoped would encourage investment, create more jobs and improve the gateway into the town. The building has been constructed using copper on the fins, in reference to the town's early industrial heritage.<ref name=redevelopmentpdf/>

[[File:319362 Northern PowerHouse at StH Central.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Rail]] [[British Rail Class 319|Class 319]], no. 319362 ''Northern Powerhouse'', at [[St Helens Central railway station|St Helens Central]]]]

In 2010, it was confirmed by the government that electrification both of the Liverpool to Manchester and Liverpool to Wigan lines would be implemented, with national body [[Network Rail]] announcing a projected overall completion date of 2014. Electrification work was eventually completed in 2015 and [[Northern Rail]], the train operating company, announced the introduction of electric services on the line from the commencement of the new timetable changeover on 17 May 2015. The Liverpool to Wigan service was operated by 4-car [[British Rail Class 319|Class 319]] electric units from 2015 to 2023. The service is now operated by 3 and 4 car CAF Civity Class 331 units.

St Helens Borough Council has discussed the possibility of a new railway station at Carr Mill in [[Laffak, St Helens|Laffak]].

===Waterways===
St Helens is a landlocked town, but it has easy access to the ports of Liverpool, on the River Mersey and Mostyn, and north Wales on the River Dee. The Sankey Canal, including the St Helens section, is no longer used for transporting goods; it consists of several short sections only, with the remainder being drained and filled.

===Air===
The nearest airport is [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], located about {{convert|12|mi|km}} south-west of the town and is connected by a frequent service from St Helens bus station (the 89 service). By road, it is accessed via the St Helens Linkway to M62 westbound J7 at Rainhill. There is no direct rail connection at present, although some trains calling at St Helens Central now go to [[Liverpool South Parkway railway station|Liverpool South Parkway station]], which has shuttle buses connecting with the airport.

[[Manchester Airport]] is approximately {{convert|25|mi|km}} away. By road, it is accessed via the St Helens Linkway to M62 eastbound J7 at Rainhill and by rail; the Manchester Airport train service serves St Helens Junction station.

===Past links===
[[File:Sthelens&districttram2.jpg|right|thumb| One of St Helens Corporation's trams.]]
{{see also|Trolleybuses in St Helens}}

An extensive [[tram]] and [[trolleybus]] system operated between 1880 and 1936. Trolleybus services commenced in 1927 and ceased 30 June 1958, when the last Prescot Circle trolleybus was replaced by a bus service. From 1919, the service was operated by the [[St Helens Corporation Tramways]]; prior to this, it had been operated by the St Helens and District Tramways Company and subsequently the [[St Helens Corporation Tramways#New St Helens and District Tramways|New St Helens and District Tramways Company]]. Originally horse drawn, they became steam powered by 1890 and then electric by 1899. The original lines were all removed during the war for steel for the war effort. The only tram tracks left can be seen in the Transport Museum and one isolated trolleybus pole that carried the power lines can still be seen in Warrington Road, Peasley Cross.

A tram link also existed, to Windle and in Haydock, the latter serving Liverpool via [[Knotty Ash]].

==Governance==
===Civic history===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:St Helens Town Hall.jpg|right|thumb|[[St Helens Town Hall]] as it appears today without the steeple.]]
St Helens first became responsible for the administration of the wider area in 1836 when made a Registration sub-district of the Prescot Parish as part of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] that devolved control down to the more localised Parish control (spurred on by the [[Reform Act 1832]]).

St Helens, in Hardshaw of Windle, constructed its original Town Hall in 1839 that served as a legal court, meeting house, and administrative centre. It also held Council meetings for [[Aldermen]] and Parishioners alike.

In 1868, St Helens was incorporated as a borough (covering the 4 Townships). In response to the old, smaller, hall suffering fire damage in 1872 a new hall was planned. This current town hall was built between 1872 and 1876. In 1889 St Helens was again reformed, this time as a [[county borough]] with greater responsibility over an increased area of land. This was part of an ongoing process of local government restructure during the Victorian era, this time as part of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]].

As a county borough, St Helens was, from 1889 to 1974, inside the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Lancashire]]. On 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], St Helens became the administrative centre of the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens]] in the newly created [[Merseyside]] [[Metropolitan county]]. At this time St Helens Borough Council replaced all the local Councils within the prescribed area.

===Historic coat of arms===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:StHelenscoatofarms.png|right|thumb|upright|St. Helens County Borough Council coat of arms 1876–1974, "Ex Terra Lucem" - ''"From the Ground, Light"'' granted in 1876]]
The old Town and Borough Council coat of arms were granted on 17 January 1876. The coat of arms is an Argent (white or silver) [[Field (heraldry)|Field]] common to earlier coat of arms in the area. The black cross is referenced from the family of the Ecclestons. The [[saltire]]s in the first and fourth quarters are from the arms of the Gerards of Windleshaw. The "second and third a [[Griffin|griffon]] segreant" meanwhile are taken from the Bold family. The blue bars are from the arms of the Parr family, Marquises of Northampton. The lion is from the crest of the Walmsleys and the two fleurs-de-lys refer to Sir David Gamble, first Mayor and benefactor of the town, and the Haydock family.

As the council ceased to exist in 1974, these arms are since then no longer in use. The coat of arms of the present council of Metropolitan Borough of St Helens has taken over part of its design.

===Motto===
The motto was the Latin '''"Ex Terra Lucem"'''. A literal translation would be "From the Ground, Light" whilst more descriptive translations might be "Light out of the earth" or "Out of the earth comes light". The phrase refers to both the abundant and winnable coal resources (which can be burnt, to produce "light") in addition to their use in local industry such as Glass (through which light passes).

The motto of the town and larger borough was changed in 1974 to "PROSPERITAS IN EXCELSIS" ("Success in the highest"or "Flourishing well"), which is included on the arms of the Metropolitan borough Council.

After the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] the creative writer behind [[Danny Boyle]]'s opening ceremony revealed that the town motto was a significant influence to the Olympic cauldron designed by [[Thomas Heatherwick]]. The cauldron petals, once lit, started on the floor and rose up to form one torch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/10363386.Ex_Terra_Lucem_restored_as_motto_of_St_Helens/|title=Ex Terra Lucem restored as motto of St Helens|work=St Helens Star|date=18 April 2013|access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>

The success and high profile of the games led the council and local residents to consider re-adopting "Ex Terra Lucem". It was felt that it was more appropriate to the town's history and had more meaning for local people, representing hope for the future. A number of people had raised this and requested that the Council consider replacing the motto.

A public consultation commenced on 17 January 2013 and at its meeting held on 17 April 2013, Council resolved to revert to the original motto of "Ex Terra Lucem". The Coat of Arms remained the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/what-we-do/council,-meetings-and-democracy/councillors,-democracy-and-elections/mayor-of-st-helens/description-of-the-coat-of-arms/|title=The St. Helens Coat of Arms|work=St. Helens Council|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305135826/http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/what-we-do/council,-meetings-and-democracy/councillors,-democracy-and-elections/mayor-of-st-helens/description-of-the-coat-of-arms/|archive-date=5 March 2014}}</ref>

===Parliamentary representation===
St Helens is represented by the [[St Helens South and Whiston (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens South and Whiston]] and [[St Helens North (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens North]] constituencies. Both contain areas outside of the town boundary, but within the greater Borough. Each constituency sends 1 representative to Parliament.

At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election in 2015]] both [[David Watts, Baron Watts|Dave Watts]] and [[Shaun Woodward]] stood down from their seats. David Watts MP (St Helens North) had been incumbent since 1997, whilst Shaun Woodward MP (St Helens South and Whiston) had retained his seat since 2001. Watts received a [[life peerage]] and became Baron Watts in December 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Parliamentary career for Lord Watts - MPs and Lords - UK Parliament|url=https://members.parliament.uk/member/489/career|access-date=2020-07-04|website=members.parliament.uk|language=en}}</ref>

[[Conor McGinn]] (St Helens North) and [[Marie Rimmer]] (St Helens South and Whiston) were selected as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidates and both were elected as MPs in 2015.

Rimmer and McGinn both held their seats at the 2019 general election.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MPs and Lords - UK Parliament|url=https://members.parliament.uk/|access-date=2020-07-04|website=members.parliament.uk|language=en}}</ref>

In [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024]] McGinn stood down and [[David Baines]], also of the Labour Party, was elected.

The town is considered a Labour stronghold and to have "safe (Labour) seats".

===Local council representation===

===Parish councils===
St Helens is also served by several parish councils. Their activity is much reduced in the modern borough, but are still active in the communities and are recognised by the Borough Council<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/lgnl.htm?id=723 |title=Parish and town councils |publisher=St Helens Borough Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615103711/http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/lgnl.htm?id=723 |archive-date=15 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> as they may "undertake many duties such as street lighting, managing cemeteries, allotments, commons, village halls, war memorials and markets etc".

===Theatre===
====The Citadel Theatre====
{{main|Citadel Arts Centre}}
The first Theatre Royal was built on Bridge Street, opening in 1847<ref name=fletcher/> and was a large wooden barn. This was open for several seasons until heavy snow caused the roof to collapse.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} It was replaced by a new Theatre Royal on Milk Street.

Revill built a new theatre on Corporation Street and transferred the Theatre Royal name to this instead.

The Milk Street theatre was then purchased by the Salvation Army where it was more or less completely re-built internally. It was renamed SA Citadel and was used for this purpose for nearly 90 years, until the Salvation Army moved to a newer site. It was then opened as The Citadel Arts Centre in 1988 and was refurbished in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Citadel Arts|url=http://www.citadel.org.uk/history-of-the-citadel/|access-date=2020-07-04|website=Citadel Arts|language=en-US}}</ref>
