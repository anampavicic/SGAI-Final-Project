'''Bata''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbata|lang|Pronunciation of Bata in Spanish.ogg}}) is a [[port city]] in the [[Litoral (Equatorial Guinea)|Litoral]] [[Provinces of Equatorial Guinea|province]] of  [[Equatorial Guinea]]. With a 2005 estimated population of 173,046, it is the most populous city in Equatorial Guinea. It lies on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] coast of [[Río Muni]]. Bata was formerly capital of Equatorial Guinea and is a transport hub and [[port]], from which [[ferry|ferries]] sail to [[Malabo]] and [[Douala]], while aircraft can land at [[Bata Airport]]. Bata is also known for its [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]] and [[Market (place)|market]].

== History ==

After the anti-Spanish riots of 1969, the European population declined in Bata, and severe economic stagnation affected Bata in the 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=Britannica>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Bata Bata], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> An oil boom of the country boosted the development of the city in the late 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=Britannica/>

On 7 March 2021, the city was struck by [[2021 Bata explosions|a series of explosions]] which resulted in the death of at least 105 people and the wounding of more than 615 others.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 March 2020|others=[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]]|title=Death toll from devastating Equatorial Guinea blasts jumps to 98|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/8/death-toll-from-devastating-equatorial-guinea-blasts-jumps-to-98|access-date=8 March 2020|website=|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=2021-03-10|title=Bata blast: Satellite images show Equatorial Guinea destruction|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56337856|access-date=2021-03-11}}</ref> The majority of the buildings in the city were damaged by the explosions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bata explosion: Equatorial Guinea death toll rises to 98 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56300088 |access-date=March 8, 2021 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

== Economy ==

Bata has one of the deepest seaports in the region. Despite this, Bata has no natural harbor and a [[jetty]] was built to facilitate offshore handling of ships' cargoes. The principal exports are [[timber]] and [[coffee]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9100738/Bata#908108.hook Encyclopædia Britannica], Retrieved on June 18, 2008</ref> The port was expanded in part by Chinese cooperation loans, and its capacity is 6,5 million tonnes and 300,000 TEUs annually.<ref>BRI and International Cooperation in Industrial Capacity: Industrial Layout Study, Xu Shaoshi
Routledge, 14 June 2020</ref> 

== Climate ==

Bata, like most of Equatorial Guinea, has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am''). It is much less gloomy than [[Malabo]], and has its dry season in the opposite months to insular Equatorial Guinea but in the same months as neighbouring [[Gabon]] due to the [[Benguela Current]]. There is also a minor depression in rainfall between December and February when the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] is at its most southerly, and unlike the true dry season in July and August, this is accompanied by increased sunshine. The rainiest months are April, May, October and November, when monthly totals of {{convert|300|mm|inch|0|disp=or}} are typical, although October averages as much as {{convert|457|mm|in|1|disp=or}}.
