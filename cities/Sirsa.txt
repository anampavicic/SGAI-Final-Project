'''Sirsa''' is a [[city]] and a [[municipal council]] in [[Sirsa district]] in the westernmost region of the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Haryana]], bordering [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Rajasthan]]. It is located near to Thar desert. It is located 250 kilometres north-west of [[New Delhi]] and 260 kilometers south-west of state capital [[Chandigarh]]. Sirsa's nearest cities include [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Fatehabad, Haryana|Fatehabad]], [[Ellenabad]], [[Bhadra]], [[Nohar]], [[Mandi Dabwali]] and [[Hanumangarh]]. Its history dates back to the time of the [[Mahabharata]]. At one time, the [[Sarasvati River]] flowed in this area.<ref name="sirsa.gov.in">{{cite web |url=https://sirsa.gov.in/hi/%e0%a4%87%e0%a4%a4%e0%a4%bf%e0%a4%b9%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%b8-2/ |title = इतिहास {{!}} Sirsa {{!}} India}}</ref>

==Name==
Sirsa has been identified with two earlier names: ''Sarsūti'' in medieval sources and ''Śairīṣaka'' in ancient literature.<ref name="Gazetteer 1988">{{cite book |editor1-last=Dheer |editor1-first=S. P. |title=Haryana District Gazetteers: Sirsa |date=1988 |publisher=Haryana Gazetteer Organisation |location=Chandigarh |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ministry.08228/mode/2up |access-date=19 February 2024}}</ref>{{rp|1}}<ref>
* The specific spelling ''Sarsūti'', with the diacritic, is from ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', Vol. XXIII, p. 45. [https://archive.org/details/TheImperialGazetteerOfIndia-Volume23/page/n55/mode/2up See here].
* The specific spelling ''Śairīṣaka'' is from [[Vettam Mani]]'s ''Puranic Encyclopedia'', p. 667. [https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft/page/666/mode/2up See here].
</ref> ''Sarsūti'' appears to come from the name of the [[Sarasvati River]], which once flowed near Sirsa.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 1 --> Ancient texts mentioning ''Śairīṣaka'' include the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'', where it is mentioned as one of the places conquered by [[Nakula]]; the ''[[Aṣṭādhyāyī]]'' of [[Pāṇini]]; and the ''[[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]]''.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 1 --> The name ''Śairīṣaka'' may be derived from the siris tree, ''[[Albizia lebbeck]]'', which is common in the area.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 1 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1988"/>{{rp|1}}

A few [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]] also exist for the name.<!-- Summarizing from Gupta --> One derives the name from that of a mystic named Baba Sarsain Nath, but there is no historical evidence for this.<!-- Gupta 1991, p. 4 --><ref name="Gupta 1991">{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=Jugal Kishore |title=History of Sirsa Town |date=1991 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distributors |location=New Delhi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9MKmwEACAAJ |access-date=20 February 2024}}</ref>{{rp|4}} Another local tradition holds that the town and its fort were founded by a 7th-century king named Saras and subsequently named after him.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 1 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1988"/>{{rp|1}}

==History==
There are two adjacent archaeological mounds on the southwest side of present-day Sirsa, but they have not been excavated by archaeologists, so the origins of the settlement at Sirsa are unknown.<!-- Gupta 1991, p. 16 --> However, some isolated discoveries have been made at the Sirsa mounds.<!-- Kind of summarizing from Gupta, for example p. 17 and p. 19--> The oldest find is a terracotta toy wheel, found in 1988, that archaeologists believe belongs to the Iron Age [[Painted Grey Ware culture]] ({{circa}} 1200-600 BCE).<!-- Gupta 1991, p. 17 --> Four terracotta figures, including three depicting women and one depicting a tree (possibly a [[kalpataru]] motif), are dated to roughly the time of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] dynasties.<!-- Gupta 1991, p. 19 --> Numerous copper coins of the [[Yaudheya]] and [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] periods have been found at Sirsa, along with various terracotta objects.<!-- Gupta 1991, p. 19-21 --> These include a statute of the Buddha, a 0.6-m-tall sculpture of the goddess [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]] on [[makara|her mount]], a [[mukhalinga]] depicting [[Shiva]], a figure of an elephant with a man and woman riding on top, and various others.<!-- Gupta 1991, p. 20-21 --> Three gold coins from the [[Gupta Empire]] (one depicting [[Samudragupta]] and an unnamed queen consort, one depicting [[Chandragupta II]], and one of [[Kumaragupta I]]) have also been found at Sirsa, along with numerous terracotta objects.<!-- Gupta 1991, p. 21-2 --><ref name="Gupta 1991"/>{{rp|17–22}}

Another discovery from Sirsa is a stone slab inscribed in Sanskrit with a king's eulogy.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 26 --> The king's name, along with most of the composition, is lost.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 26 --> This inscription is dated to the 5th or 6th century.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 26 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1988"/>{{rp|26}}

Another stone inscription found at the Sirsa mound dates from the 9th century, during the reign of [[Mihira Bhoja]].<!-- Epigraphia Indica XXI, p. 294 --> Although a large part is missing,<!-- Epigraphia Indica XXI, p. 294 --><ref name="Epigraphia Indica XXI">{{cite book |last1=Sahni |first1=Daya Ram |editor1-last=Sastri |editor1-first=Hirananda |editor2-last=Dikshit |editor2-first=K.

According to the ''Tarikh-i-[[Firishta]]'',<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 26 --> the [[Ghaznavid]] sultan [[Masʽud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud I]] captured Sirsa during his campaign to conquer [[Hansi]] in 1037.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 26 --><!-- Gupta 1991, p. 28 --> His troops apparently encountered an abundance of [[sugar cane]] growing at Sirsa, which they used to fill the moat around the town's fortress in order to attack it.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 26 --><!-- Gupta 1991, p. 28 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1988"/>{{rp|26}}<ref name="Gupta 1991"/>{{rp|28}} However, subsequent Ghaznavid infighting seems to have enabled the [[Tomara dynasty]] to recapture Sirsa, since coins of Tomara rulers both before and after 1037 have been found at Sirsa.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 26-7 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1988"/>{{rp|26–7}}

The historian [[Hasan Nizami]] mentioned Sirsa (as ''Sarsuti'') as the place where [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] was captured after the [[Second Battle of Tarain]] in 1192.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 27 --> From this point on, Sirsa came under Muslim control.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 27 --> It constituted an ''[[iqta]]'', in this context meaning an administrative division, under the [[Delhi Sultanate]].<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 29 --> [[Ibn Battuta]] visited Sirsa in 1341, during the reign of the Delhi sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughlaq]]; he mentioned that it grew a lot of rice, some of which was exported to Delhi.<!-- Gazetteer 1988, p. 29 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1988"/>{{rp|27–9}} Also during the 1300s, the Iranian historian [[Wassaf]] mentioned Sirsa (as ''Sarsuti'') as one of the major cities of northern India.<ref name="Gupta 1991"/>{{rp|5}}

Sirsa is listed in the [[Ain-i-Akbari]] as a [[pargana]] under the [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] of [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], producing a revenue of 4,361,368 [[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]s for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 5000 infantry and 500 cavalry.<ref name="Ain-i-Akbari">{{cite book |last1=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |last2=Jarrett |first2=Henry Sullivan (translator) |title=The Ain-i-Akbari |date=1891 |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |location=Calcutta |page=294 |url=https://archive.org/details/ainiakbarivolum00mubgoog |access-date=21 January 2021}}</ref><ref name="sirsa.gov.in"/>
