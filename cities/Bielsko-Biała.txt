'''Bielsko-Biała''' ({{IPA|pl|ˈbjɛlskɔ ˈbjawa|lang|Pl-Bielsko-Biała.ogg}}; {{langx|cs|Bílsko-Bělá}}; {{langx|de|Bielitz-Biala}}, {{langx|szl|Biylsko-Biołŏ}}; {{langx|wym|Byłc-Bejł}}) is a city in southern Poland, with a population of approximately 166,765 as of December 2022, making it the [[List of cities and towns in Poland#Largest cities and towns by population|22nd largest city in Poland]], and an area of {{cvt|124.51|km2}}.<ref name = population/> It is the core of the broader [[metropolitan area]] with around 335,000 inhabitants. It serves as the seat of the [[Bielsko County]], [[Euroregion Beskydy]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bielsko–Żywiec]] and the [[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland|Evangelical Church Diocese of Cieszyn]].

Situated north of the [[Beskids|Beskid Mountains]], Bielsko-Biała is composed of two former towns which merged in 1951—''Bielsko'' in the west and ''Biała'' in the east—on opposite banks of the [[Biała (Vistula)|Biała River]] that divides historical regions of [[Silesia]] and [[Lesser Poland]]. The history of Bielsko dates back to the 13th century, while Biała was founded in the 16th century and obtained city rights in 1723. Despite the administrative separation, both towns effectively functioned as one urban area already in the 19th century. Industrialization, especially the [[textile industry|textile]] and [[automotive industry|automotive]] industries, was of great importance for its development in the past. Between 1975 and 1998, the city was the seat of [[Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship]] and currently lies within the [[Silesian Voivodeship]].

Bielsko-Biała is the administrative, economic, academic and cultural centre for the Silesian-Lesser Polish border region, sometimes colloquially referred to as ''Podbeskidzie''.<ref group="notes">Nevertheless, the use of this term is a subject of considerable controversy and is often rejected by people with a clear Silesian or Lesser Polish identity.

== Toponymy ==

[[File:Czasopismo_Wieniec_Pszczółka_1909.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A Polish newspaper issued in 1909 "in Bielsko-Biała"]]
Both Bielsko and Biała derive their names from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] stem ''*bělъ'' meaning "white" (in modern [[Polish language|Polish]] ''biały'', in modern [[Czech language|Czech]] ''bílý''). The [[Biała (Vistula)|river Biała]] was the first to be named in this way. The reason was probably the general impression of the color of the water: "white", that is, bright and clear.<ref name="etymologia2">{{cite book |date=2003 |first=Maria |isbn=83-01-13857-2 |last=Malec |location=Warsaw |publisher=[[Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN]] |title=Słownik etymologiczny nazw geograficznych Polski (Etymological Dictionary of Polish Geographic Names)}}<!-- auto-translated from Polish by Module:CS1 translator --></ref> Some researchers also linked the city's name to the [[bleach]]ing of fiber, which is questionable, however, due to the fact that in the 13th century the cloth industry in Bielsko was not yet developed.<ref name="ref2">{{cite web |access-date=2008-08-23 |author=Urząd Miejski w Bielsku-Białej |title=Historia Bielska i Białej oraz Bielska-Białej |url=http://web2.um.bielsko.pl/bb/dzialy/kultura/zakladka/Historia_miasta_1.pdf}}<!-- auto-translated from Polish by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>

The [[German language|German]] name was derived from the Slavic one. In medieval and early modern documents, the name of the town appears both in a form close to modern Polish and Czech (''Bilsko'', ''Belsko'') and German (''Bilitz'', ''Belicz'', ''Bylitz''). Over time, the official name ''Bielitz'' in German and ''Bílsko'' in Czech became established, while in Polish there were still various fluctuations in the 20th century, such as between ''Bielsko'' in the [[neuter gender]] and ''Bielsk'' in the [[masculine gender]]. In the case of Biała, the Polish wording of the name was the only official one, even when the town belonged to the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. The Germanized form ''Beil'' was used only in the local dialect. The [[Wymysorys language]] uses the form ''Byłc-Bejł'' which is close to how the two towns were called by the autochthonous German population.

The combined name ''Bielsko-Biała'' in Polish or ''Bielitz-Biala'' in German was used as early as the 19th century in the names of various societies, clubs, branches of institutions and businesses (e.g. ''Bielitz-Bialaer Leseverein'', ''Bielitz-Bialaer Actienbrauerei'' or ''Bielsko-Bialski Związek Adwokatów''), in the titles of local newspapers (e.g. ''Bielitz-Bialaer Anzeiger'' or ''Bielitz-Bialaer Wochenblatt''), as the name of a railroad station, on maps printed jointly for both cities, and in many other publications.

==Geography==
=== Location and relief===
Bielsko-Biała is located in the southern part of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]], on the border of historical regions: [[Cieszyn Silesia]] (left-bank districts, 57.89% of the area) and [[Lesser Poland]] (right-bank districts, 42.11% of the area). The city represents 1.01% of the area of the voivodeship and 0.04% of the area of Poland. The latitudinal extent is approximately {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} km and the meridional extent approximately {{convert|17.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The straight line distance from the city center to the [[Czech Republic–Poland border|Czech border]] is {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and to the [[Slovakia–Poland border|Slovak border]] {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
[[File:Bielsko-Biała,_widok_z_Trzech_Lipek_01.jpg|thumb|left|View from the Trzy Lipki hill towards the Silesian Beskids]]
[[File:Bielsko-Biała,_widok_z_wieży_katedry_św._Mikołaja_-_Beskid_Śląski.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Silesian Beskids from the Cathedral of St. Nicholas]]
The greater part of Bielsko-Biała lies in the [[Silesian Foothills]] (''Pogórze Śląskie''), which are part of the Western Beskid Foothills (''Pogórze Zachodniobeskidzkie'') physiographic macroregion. Within the administrative borders of Bielsko-Biała—in the southern districts—there are also mountain massifs of the [[Little Beskids]] (''Beskid Mały'') and the [[Silesian Beskids]] (''Beskid Śląski''). Most of the mountainous areas of Bielsko-Biała lie within two [[Landscape park (protected area)|landscape parks]]: [[Little Beskids Landscape Park]] and [[Silesian Beskids Landscape Park]]. At the same time, they are protected under the [[Natura 2000]] nature protection programme.
[[File:020211017 204044 Biała River in Bielsko Biała.jpg|thumb|Biała River in the city centre]]
The [[Terrain|relief]] of Bielsko-Biała is quite diverse. Within the administrative borders of the city there are both upland and mountainous areas. The centrally located Bolesław Chrobry Square is {{convert|313|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The lowest point are Komorowice Ponds at {{convert|262|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, while the highest peak is Klimczok in Silesian Beskids at {{convert|1117|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The upland part of Bielsko-Biała consists of dozens of hills, separated by valleys of rivers and streams, the central one being the valley of the [[Biała (Vistula)|Biała River]]. The Beskid massifs are separated by the Wilkowice Gate (''Brama Wilkowicka'') connecting the [[Silesian Foothills]] (''Pogórze Śląskie'') with the [[Żywiec Basin]] (''Kotlina Żywiecka''). There are 14 mountain peaks within the city limits: Cyberniok, Dębowiec, Klimczok, Kołowrót, Kopany, Kozia Góra, Łysa Góra, Palenica, Przykra, Równia, Stołów, Szyndzielnia, Trzy Kopce and Wysokie. In addition, the slopes of Czupel, Gaiki and Magurka Wilkowicka mountains partly reach the peripheral districts of Bielsko-Biała. On the south-western slopes of Stołów is the Stołów Cave (''Jaskinia w Stołowie''), whose passages are {{convert|21|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. In 2003, an entrance to the Deep Stołów Cave (''Jaskinia Głęboka w Stołowie'') was also discovered on the slopes of Stołów. With a length of {{convert|554|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a depth of {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}}, it is one of the largest caves in the Polish part of [[Carpathians]]. Several smaller caves can also be found in the Klimczok area.

===Climate===
Bielsko-Biała has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') with cold, damp winters and warm, wet summers. However, using the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm, the climate is a Dfb-type called of [[humid continental climate]], which explains its considerable thermal amplitude for [[Central Europe]]. The extremes may still be moderated by the western patterns and winds of this direction, which still maintains hybrid characteristics in the city's climate. [[Foehn wind|Foëhn winds]] help maintain a milder winter in Bielsko-Biała and average about 4&nbsp;°C lower than the surrounding mountains each year. The sunniest days are between late summer and early fall, with a few months reaching 9 sunny days. In the 1960s 55&nbsp;cm of snow cover was recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=621&cityname=Bielsko-Biala,+Silesian+Voivodeship,+Poland&units=|title=Bielsko-Biala, Poland Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcit.bbosir.bielsko.pl/the-climate-of-bielsko-biala/|title=The climate of Bielsko-Biała and Podbeskidzie Region – Informacja Turystyczna – Bielsko-Biała|access-date=2019-08-05|archive-date=2018-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430132000/http://mcit.bbosir.bielsko.pl/the-climate-of-bielsko-biala/}}</ref>

=== Air pollution ===
Bielsko-Biała is a city with relatively high [[air pollution]]. According to a 2016 report by the [[World Health Organization]], it was ranked as the twenty-seventh most polluted city in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web |title=Przerażający raport ws. jakości powietrza.

The environmental situation in the city has been gradually improving in recent years. This is influenced by municipal measures such as the "Low Emission Economy Plan", which has been implemented since 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Resolution No. X/155/2015 on the adoption for implementation of the document "Low Emission Economy Plan and Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) for the City of Bielsko-Biała" |url=https://bip.um.bielsko.pl/Article/get/id,60931.html |publisher=Bielsko-Biała City Council |access-date=22 July 2023 |language=pl}}</ref> In 2020, 454 coal-fired boilers in residentional buildings were replaced by gas or [[district heating]] using municipal subsidies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Environmental Protection Programme for the City of Bielsko-Biała for the period 2021-2024. |url=https://bip.um.bielsko.pl/a,80082,obwieszczenie-dot-programu-ochrony-srodowiska-dla-miasta-bielska-bialej-na-lata-2021-2024-z-perspekt.html |publisher=Bielsko-Biała City Council |access-date=22 July 2023}}</ref>

Bielsko-Biała belongs to the cities where the environmental condition has been gradually improving over the past few years. The number of days when the permissible daily concentration of suspended particulate matter PM10 was exceeded in the years 2018-2022 were as follows: 52, 30, 33, 41, 24, respectively.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

The main contributors to air pollution are the use of outdated solid fuel sources in households, emissions of gases and particles from industrial plants, and traffic.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

The operation of outdated heating systems and solid fuel combustion sources within the city promotes the formation of smog during the heating season. Smog has a negative impact on human health and can also have destructive effects on buildings, especially historical ones.

Pollution from traffic is concentrated within densely built-up areas known as "street canyons." The city's air quality is significantly influenced by transregional factors, such as the influx of pollutants from neighboring municipalities.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

The quality of the water flowing through the city has been gradually improving. However, in 2022, the state of a significant portion of surface water, both in the Biała and Wapienica rivers, was classified as poor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Informatyczny System Osłony Kraju |url=https://eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fisok.gov.pl%2Fhydroportal.html&data=05%7C01%7Cbeata.rozpedek%40um.bielsko-biala.pl%7C6558c34ad6b748232fc308dbba664b23%7C49e6c2960fc046c291d5b2694ca14f04%7C0%7C0%7C638308720737196231%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=r%2FwdngoKwjQc8%2Bb9HHDfehBRKILxTYGl%2BihrMJsOHVg%3D&reserved=0 |access-date=21 September 2023}}</ref>

The city's ecological situation has been gradually improving in recent years, thanks in part to the actions of municipal authorities, such as the implementation of the "Low-Emission Economy Plan" since 2010. Between 2008 and 2022, with the city's support, over 7200 solid fuel boilers and furnaces were eliminated in residential buildings in Bielsko-Biała.

The first municipal Energy Management Bureau in Poland was established in Bielsko-Biała in 1997, and it currently operates as an energy team within the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy of the Municipal Office.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

In 2022, there were three monitoring stations in the city as part of the National Air Quality Monitoring System, and the city installed 36 air quality sensors in urban areas to depict the distribution of pollutants within the city [Source: Data from the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, Municipal Office in Bielsko-Biała].

[[File:Bielsko-Biała, obręby ewidencyjne.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Division of Bielsko-Biała into ''obręby ewidencyjne'']]
In parallel, there is a division into ''obręby ewidencyjne'' ([[cadastre|cadastral]] areas), the boundaries of which reflect the former boundaries of the [[municipality|municipalities]] gradually incorporated into Bielsko-Biała in the 20th century, as well as the boundaries of the historical districts (suburbs) of Bielsko. These are:
* Bielsko Miasto (comprises the Old Town of Bielsko)
* Biała Miasto (comprises Biała within the original boundaries from the 18th century)
* Dolne Przedmieście (formally divided into thirteen small areas)
* Górne Przedmieście
* Żywieckie Przedmieście
* [[Aleksandrowice, Bielsko-Biała|Aleksandrowice]]

Some peripheral areas are also included within ''obręby ewidencyjne'' of [[Bystra, Bielsko County|Bystra Śląska]], [[Jaworze, Silesian Voivodeship|Jaworze]], [[Mazańcowice]], [[Międzyrzecze Górne]] and [[Pisarzowice, Bielsko County|Pisarzowice]], which is a result of the incorporation of parts of these villages into Bielsko-Biała. In some cases (e.g. Mikuszowice Krakowskie, Stare Bielsko, Straconka) the boundaries of ''osiedla'' and ''obręby ewidencyjne'' are similar, in many others (e.g. Aleksandrowice, Dolne Przedmieście, Lipnik, Mikuszowice Śląskie) ''osiedla'' and ''obręby ewidencyjne'' with the same names do not correspond territorially. The commons understanding of 'districts' in Bielsko-Biała and the belonging of particular areas to them draws loosely on both types of division.

==History==
===Bielsko===
[[File:Grodzisko_w_Bielsku-Białej.jpg|thumb|Remnats of the Stare Bielsko hillfort]]
There has been human habitation in Bielsko since around 1400 BC, wooden tools have been found along with stone axes dating from 1000 BC. The remnants of a fortified settlement in what is now the [[Stare Bielsko]] (Old Bielsko) district of the city were discovered between 1933 and 1938 by a Polish archaeological team. The settlement was dated to the 12th – 14th centuries. Its dwellers manufactured [[iron]] from [[ore]] and specialized in [[Smith (metalwork)|smithery]]. The current centre of the town was probably developed as early as the first half of the 13th century. At that time a castle (which still survives today) was built on a hill.
[[File:Bielsko-Biała_Language_Island.png|thumb|The boundaries of the Bielsko-Biala German linguistic island (Bielitz-Bialaer Sprachinsel) and earlier mentions of related localities]]
In the second half of the 13th century, the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] dukes of [[Duchy of Opole and Racibórz|Opole]] invited [[Ostsiedlung|German settlers]] to colonize the [[Silesian Foothills]]. As the dukes then also ruled over the Lesser Poland lands east of the Biała River, settlements arose on both banks like ''Bielitz'' (now [[Stare Bielsko]]), ''Nickelsdorf'' ([[Mikuszowice, Bielsko-Biała|Mikuszowice Śląskie]]), ''Kamitz'' ([[Kamienica, Bielsko-Biała|Kamienica]]), ''Batzdorf'' ([[Komorowice, Bielsko-Biała|Komorowice Śląskie]]) and ''[[Międzyrzecze Górne|Kurzwald]]'' in the west as well as ''Kunzendorf'' ([[Lipnik, Bielsko-Biała|Lipnik]]), ''Alzen'' ([[Hałcnów]]) and ''Wilmesau'' ([[Wilamowice]]) in the east. Nearby settlements in the mountains were ''Lobnitz'' ([[Wapienica, Bielsko-Biała|Wapienica]]) and ''Bistrai'' ([[Bystra, Bielsko County|Bystra]]). Those settlements did not undergo Slavonicisation in the following centuries, which led to the creation of a German language island (''Bielitz-Bialaer Sprachinsel'') that survived until the 20th century.

After the partition of the Duchy of Opole in 1281, Bielsko passed to the [[Duchy of Teschen|Dukes of Cieszyn]] within fragmented [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1031)|Poland]]. The town was first documented in 1312 when Duke [[Mieszko I, Duke of Cieszyn|Mieszko I of Cieszyn]] granted a [[German town law|town charter]]. The Biała again became a border river, when in 1315 the eastern [[Duchy of Oświęcim]] split off from Cieszyn as a separate under Mieszko's son [[Władysław of Oświęcim|Władysław]]. After the Dukes of Cieszyn had become vassals of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian kings]] in 1327 and the Duchy of Oświęcim was sold to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]] in 1457, returning to Lesser Poland after three centuries, the Biała River for next centuries marked the border between the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian crown land]] of Silesia within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Lesser Poland Province]] of the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].
[[File:Mattheus Seuter, Ducatus Teschenensis-Dynast Bilicen.jpg|thumb|Duchy of Bielsko]]
With Bohemia and the Upper Silesian Duchy of Cieszyn, Bielsko in 1526 was inherited by the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]] and incorporated into the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. From 1560 Bielsko was held by [[Frederick Casimir of Cieszyn]], son of Duke [[Wenceslaus III Adam, Duke of Cieszyn|Wenceslaus III Adam]], who due to the enormous debts his son left upon his death in 1571, had to sell it to the Promnitz noble family at [[Duchy of Pless|Pless]]. With the consent of Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], the Promnitz dynasty and their [[House of Schaffgotsch|Schaffgotsch]] successors ruled the [[Duchy of Bielsko]] as a Bohemian [[state country]]; acquired by the Austrian chancellor [[Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz]] in 1743, and afterwards by Polish aristocrat [[Aleksander Józef Sułkowski]] in 1752, the ducal status was finally confirmed by Empress [[Maria Theresa]] in 1754. It remained in possession of the Polish [[Sułkowski family]] until the dissolution of the duchy in 1849, while the castle was still owned by the Sułkowskis until World War II.
[[File:Bielsko_1801,_drzeworyt.jpg|thumb|left|Bielsko in 1801, numbers 9 and 10 mark the Bielsko Zion]]
Bielsko was the first town in the Duchy of Cieszyn where the teachings of [[Martin Luther]] spread in the late 1530s, even before Duke [[Wenceslaus III Adam, Duke of Cieszyn|Wenceslaus III Adam]] adopted [[Lutheranism]] in 1545. Also later, Bielsko was home to the strongest Protestant community in the whole of Cieszyn Silesia, which in 1587 obtained a privilege guaranteeing that only Lutheran services would be held in the town. [[Jiří Třanovský]] was active in the Bielsko castle. Bielsko retained its Protestant character also after the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The recatholisation campaign, which started in the second half of the 17th century, was not very successful. Throughout the [[Counter-Reformation]] period, Lutheran services were held—at first in the Holy Trinity Church with the permission of the authorities, later in homes or in the surrounding [[Beskids|Beskid]] forests (the so-called forest churches)—and immediately after the issuing of the [[Patent of Toleration]] by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] in 1781, an Evangelical district was established north of the historical centre, with the [[Church of the Saviour, Bielsko-Biała|Church of the Saviour]], the present seat of the [[Lutheran Diocese of Cieszyn|Lutheran bishop]] and schools, known as the [[Bielsko Zion]] (''Bielski Syjon''). To this day, it remains a Protestant cultural centre of supra-regional significance. In 1900, a monument to Martin Luther was unveiled there. It was one of only two in the whole of Austria-Hungary (the other was erected in the Bohemian town of [[Aš]]), and now is the only one within the borders of Poland. In the second half of the 19th century, Lutherans ceased to constitute the majority of the population due to the influx of new inhabitants, mostly Catholic or Jewish.

After the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king [[Frederick the Great]] had invaded Silesia, Bielsko remained with the Habsburg monarchy as part of [[Austrian Silesia]] according to the 1742 [[Treaty of Breslau]]. In late 1849 Bielsko became a seat of [[Bielitz District|political district]]. In 1870 it became a [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory city]].

[[File:Bielsko-Biała,_północna_dzielnica_przemysłowa_1915.jpg|thumb|left|The industrial landscape of Bielsko and Biała at the beginning of the 20th century]]
The town's development in the 19th century was primarily linked to the [[textile industry]], and to a lesser extent the engineering industry. The Bielsko-Biała area was described as the third largest centre of the textile industry in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]], after [[Brno]] and [[Liberec]]. In the second half of the 19th century, new tenements, villas of wealthy industrialists and public buildings in [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revival]] and [[Art Nouveau]] styles began to spring up in the landscape of the city. These were often inspired by the architecture of Vienna, to which the slogan "Little Vienna", which is still popular today, refers.<ref name="bujak"/> The local architect of the Jewish origin [[Carl Korn]] had the greatest influence on the architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, shaping the character of "Little Vienna", while the plan for urban regulation was prepared in 1899 by the Viennese urban planner [[Max Fabiani]]. In 1855 a branch of the [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]] was built from [[Czechowice-Dziedzice|Dziedzice]] to Bielsko, which in 1877 was extended to [[Żywiec]] and connected to the [[Galician Transversal Railway]]. A {{convert|268|m|ft}} long tunnel under the centre of Bielsko was then built. In 1888, a railway connection to [[Cieszyn]] and [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska]] was opened. In 1895, an [[Trams in Bielsko-Biała|electric tram line was established]] in Bielsko. It connected the railway station with Zigeunerwald/Cygański Las, which in the meantime was transformed into a forest-park complex on the model of the [[Vienna Forest]] with many summer villas of Bielsko's factory owners built in its surroundings.

However, the demographic boom was weaker than, for example, in the [[Katowice urban area|Upper Silesian conurbation]], due to the restriction of the settlement of workers in the city proper. Many of them lived in the surrounding villages, which formally remained separate, even though they were taking on an increasingly urban character. According to the 1910 census, Bielsko had a population of 18,568. 84.3% used [[German language|German]] in their domestic interactions, 14.3% used [[Polish language|Polish]], 0.7% used [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and 0.7% used another language. 55.9% were [[Roman Catholic]], 27.6% [[Lutheran]], 16.3% [[Judaism|Jewish]], and 1.1% were of another denomination or with no religion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spyra |first1=Janusz|last2=Kenig|first2=Piotr|title=Bielsko-Biała.

After 1918, when [[Austro-Hungary]] collapsed, Bielsko found itself within a [[Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed territory between Poland and Czechoslovakia]]. Attempts to incorporate the city into the [[Republic of German-Austria]] failed. In July 1920, the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] decided to divide [[Cieszyn Silesia]] in such a way that Bielsko became part of the autonomous [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920–1939)|Silesian Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Political life was largely shaped by nationalist disputes. The influx of Polish officials and teachers increased the proportion of the Polish population, but Bielsko nevertheless retained its predominantly German character. In the 1930s some [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic German]] citizens, under the leadership of [[Rudolf Wiesner]], formed an [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] ''[[Jungdeutsche Partei]]'', which de facto served as a foreign branch of the [[NSDAP]]. A considerable number of young Germans joined this Party during the mid-1930s.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9RWAAAAMAAJ |title=Nazi Front Schlesien: niemieckie organizacje polityczne w województwie Śląskim w latach 1933-1939 |publisher=Wydawnictwo Śląsk, Katowice |year=1963 |access-date=11 September 2014 |author=Karol Grünberg}}</ref>
[[File:Bielsko-Biała, Aleje Sułkowskiego.jpg|thumb|New residential district in the 1930s]]
On the other hand, the interwar period is associated with numerous construction projects, such as a new residential district in [[Modernist architecture|Modernist style]] created since 1934 in place of the former castle gardens, or the building of the first Polish high school (now [[Nicolaus Copernicus High School, Bielsko-Biała|Nicolaus Copernicus High School]]) put into use in 1927. In 1938, the municipality of [[Aleksandrowice, Bielsko-Biała|Aleksandrowice]] was incorporated, where an airport and a pilot school were established.

===Biała===
[[File:BialaExpansion1564-2002.gif|thumb|The territorial evolution of Biała over centuries]]
The history of Biała dates back to the second half of the 16th century. The first written mention comes from 1564 and describes a small craftsmen settlement of thirteen houses. It was located near the mouth of Niwka to the [[Biała (Vistula)|Biała River]], in the area of today's Łukowa Street. Administratively, it belonged to the [[Silesian County]] of the [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]] within the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. The first residents most likely came from the suburbs of neighboring Bielsko. They crossed to the other side of the river tempted by the opportunity to build new houses in the face of restrictions imposed by the Bielsko town council and disputes between the suburban population and the privileged [[Burgher (social class)|burghers]] of the Old Town. The settlement was established on the land of the village of [[Lipnik, Bielsko-Biała|Lipnik]], from which it became independent in 1613. Further development of the village was associated with the influx of refugees from neighboring Silesia during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Though already named a town in the 17th century, Biała officially was granted [[town privileges|borough rights]] by the Polish king [[Augustus II the Strong]] in 1723. At that time it counted only 40 inhabited houses and about 300 residents, mostly German-speaking and [[Lutheran]]. There has been a new urban layout made, in the center of which was a rectangular market square - today's [[Wojska Polskiego Square, Bielsko-Biała|Wojska Polskiego Square]].

In the course of the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, Biała was annexed by the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] and incorporated into the crownland of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]. After that the town underwent major urban transformations in the 1780s in connection with the construction of the Central Galician Road, part of which is today's [[11 Listopada Street, Bielsko-Biała|11 Listopada Street]]. At that time, the New Market was also delineated - the present [[Wolności Square, Bielsko-Biała|Wolności Square]].
[[File:Map_of_Bielitz_1855_(2).jpg|thumb|Bielsko and Biała in the mid-19th century]]
[[File:01910_Market_Square_in_Biała,_Plac_Józefa.jpg|thumb|Market Square in Biała around 1910]]
The town's boundaries were artificially limited as a result of disputes with the [[Lipnik, Bielsko-Biała|Lipnik]] municipality, which refused to give up part of its territory, even though the western part of Lipnik formed an urban and functional unity with Biała. West Lipnik also formed the de facto [[Jews in Bielsko-Biała|Jewish quarter of Biała]], due to the official ban on Jewish settlement in the town, which was in effect from 1757 to 1848. Joachim Adler's cloth factory, considered the first mechanized factory in the Bielsko-Biala area, was also established within Lipnik's borders in 1810. Lipnik was finally incorporated into Biała in 1925. The town thus expanded its territory more than sixteen times (before 1925 it had only {{convert|1.22|sqkm|sqmi}}, while Lipnik had {{convert|20.76|sqkm|sqmi}}), and the population increased two and a half times.

In the 19th century, Biała formed a single industrial region with Bielsko, also with a predominance of [[textile industry]]. From 1867 it was the capital of [[Biała County, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Biała County]]. At the turn of the 20th century, a number of "Vienna-like" buildings were constructed in Biała, too, including a pompous [[Bielsko-Biała City Hall|Neo-Renaissance town hall]] in 1895–1897.

According to the 1910 census, Biała had a population of 8,668. 69.3% used [[German language|German]] in their domestic interactions, 29.3% used [[Polish language|Polish]], and 1.4% used another language (mainly [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]). 72.1% were [[Roman Catholic]], 17,7% [[Judaism|Jewish]] and 12.3% [[Lutheran]]. Of the remaining 0.9%, there were small groups of [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and five people with no religion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Polak |first1=Jerzy |title=Bielsko-Biała.

With the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918, Biała became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Throughout the interwar period it belonged to the [[Kraków Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Kraków Voivodeship]]. From 1925, the official name of the town was ''Biała Krakowska''.

Although the two towns effectively functioned as one urban area for a long time, they were administratively combined for the first time by the Nazi authorities after the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. Biała became a district of Bielsko under the name ''Bielitz-Ost''. During the [[World War II]], the city belonged to the [[Third Reich]], within the [[province of Upper Silesia]]. Germans committed various crimes against the Polish and Jewish population. Several Polish teachers and principals were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]] and murdered there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

Only less than 1000 people of the city's Jewish community of nearly 8000 survived the war. Several widely known [[Holocaust survivors]] from Bielsko-Biała were [[Roman Frister]], [[Gerda Weissmann Klein]] and [[Kitty Hart-Moxon]], all of whom wrote accounts of their experiences during the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frister |first1=Roman |title=The Cap or the Price of Life |date=1999 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |pages=352}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=Gerda Weissman |title=All but My Life |date=1957 |publisher=Hill and Wang}}</ref> However, when it comes to material losses, the city survived the war almost intact. It was not bombed, and fighting during the [[Western Carpathian offensive|Soviet offensive]] in the winter of 1945 was limited to today's peripheral districts, such as [[Hałcnów]] and the eastern part of [[Lipnik, Bielsko-Biała|Lipnik]].

After World War II, the ethnic structure of the place changed. Most of the German population [[1944–50 flight and expulsion of Germans|was expelled]] and those who remained assimilated with the Poles. In the 21st century, there is only a small [[German minority in Poland|German minority]] circle in the town. [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|Poles transferred]] from the [[Kresy|eastern areas that had been annexed to the USSR]], as well as new settlers from central Poland, especially [[Lesser Poland]], came to Bielsko-Biała.

The new Polish authorities initially restored the pre-war borders, including the division into Bielsko and Biała in two different voivodeships. But soon the decision to re-unify the two towns was made. The new municipality under the name ''Bielsko-Biała'' was created on January 1, 1951.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/they-say-love-dont-come-easy---but-it-does-in-bielsko-biala-41533 |title=They say love don't come easy - but it does in Bielsko-Biała! |website=thefirstnews.com |author=Alex Webber |date=22 September 2023 |access-date=22 September 2023}}</ref> Until 1975, it was part of the [[Katowice Voivodeship]].

In post-war Poland, the city has remained an important centre of [[textile industry]] (second only to [[Łódź]]), alongside which new branches have developed: in 1946 the [[Szybowcowy Zakład Doświadczalny|Gliding Institute]] was established and in 1948 the car engine plant WSM, on the basis of which the [[Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych|FSM Automobile Factory]] was founded in 1972. The factory was born from an agreement between the [[Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych|FSO]] and [[Fiat]] for the construction of a new model, the [[Polski Fiat]] 126p, Polish version of [[Fiat 126]] commonly known as ''Maluch''. A huge industrial complex has been built in the northern part of the city. Thousands of people came from all over Poland to work then; in the 1970s Bielsko-Biała observed the biggest population boom in its history. The influx of new residents was associated with the construction of new housing estates with [[large panel system-building]]s, like Złote Łany (1970–1975), Wojska Polskiego (1976–1980), Beskidzkie (1976–1982) or Karpackie (1979–1982). The population has also increased due to the incorporation of surrounding communes: [[Kamienica, Bielsko-Biała|Kamienica]] and [[Mikuszowice]] (together with {{ill|Olszówka (Bielsko-Biała)|lt=Olszówka|pl}}) in 1969, [[Straconka, Bielsko-Biała|Straconka]] in 1973, [[Stare Bielsko]], [[Komorowice, Bielsko-Biała|Komorowice]], [[Hałcnów]] and [[Wapienica]] in 1977.

Bielsko-Biała was made famous on a large scale by the [[Studio Filmów Rysunkowych]] (Animated Film Studio), founded in 1947. It was one of five animation studios in post-war Poland. Among the children's TV series produced here were ''[[Reksio]]'', ''[[Bolek i Lolek]]'', ''[[Margo the Mouse]]'' and ''[[Porwanie Baltazara Gąbki (TV series)|Porwanie Baltazara Gąbki]]''.

[[1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała|The general strike]] launched by the workers of the Bewelana textile factory in January 1981 is considered the most effective strike of the [[History of Solidarity#First Solidarity (1980–1981)|first wave of Solidarity]]. The strikers forced the mayor of the city, the provincial governor, the commander of [[Milicja Obywatelska]] and the municipal and voivodeship secretaries of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Communist party]] to resign.

From 1975 to 1998, Bielsko-Biała was the capital of the [[Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship]], covering most of Polish [[Cieszyn Silesia]] and south-western [[Lesser Poland]] (counties of [[Żywiec County|Żywiec]], [[Oświęcim County|Oświęcim]], [[Wadowice County|Wadowice]] and [[Sucha Beskidzka County|Sucha Beskidzka]]). To describe its territory, the name ''[[Podbeskidzie]]'' was adopted, which is still popular among Bielsko-Biała residents ("Bielsko-Biała - the capital of Podbeskidzie"), but elsewhere it is criticized as an artificial term that is trying to replace traditional historical and geographical lands.<ref name="podbeskidzie one">{{cite news |last1=Borówka |first1=Tomasz |title=Mamy na Śląsku wyimaginowaną krainę.

The [[Balcerowicz Plan|economic transformation]] after 1989 affected the industrial city with a serious socio-economic crisis. The textile industry, which almost disappeared from Bielsko-Biała, was the most affected. The car factory bought directly by [[Fiat]] limited its production only to components. The bad condition of the historic Old Town was the clearest sign of the city's decline in the 1990s, while its gradual [[revitalization]] started in 2002 became an important symbol of changes for the better. During the first and second decades of the 21st century, Bielsko-Biała managed to return to the path of economic prosperity. Between 2001 and 2009, on the site of the demolished Lenko and Finex textile factories, a large shopping mall, [[Sfera (mall)|Galeria Sfera]], was built. It is a characteristic post-modernist architectural structure on the banks of the Biała river, however criticised for its negative influence on the traditional commercial zone located around the nearby 11 Listopada Street pedestrian zone.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Drost |first1=Jacek |title=Deptak w Bielsku-Białej zmieni się w ulicę rzemiosł.

==Demographics==
[[File:Piramida wieku Bielsko Biala.png|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of the inhabitants|upright=1.5]]

On December 31, 2021, the population of Bielsko-Biała was 168,835, including 79,740 (47.2%) men and 89,095 (52.8%) women. This means that there were 112 women for every 100 men. 56.4% of Bielsko-Biała's residents were of [[working age]], 17.5% were of pre-working age, and 26.0% of residents were of post-working age. The city's population accounted for 3.77% of the population of the Silesian Voivodeship. Population density was 1,356 people per square kilometer.<ref name="population"/>

The [[natural increase]], according to data for 2020, was negative, at -610 (-3.58 per thousand residents). 1519 children were born and 2129 deaths were registered. The [[fertility rate]] at 1.44 was slightly higher than that of the voivodeship and Poland as a whole. The balance of [[internal migration]] was -355 in 2020, while foreign migration was +24. 592 marriages were concluded. 28.6% of residents were single, 55.0% were married, 6.9% were divorced, and 9.4% were widows and widowers.<ref name="population"/>

At the time of the merger of Bielsko and Biała in 1951, the city had a population of about 60,000. Over the years, the population increased with the development of industry and the incorporation of nearby municipalities, particularly fast in the 1970s. Bielsko-Biała reached its highest population (184,421) in 1991. Since then, as in most cities in Poland, there has been a gradual decline in population. Between 2002 and 2021, the population declined by 5.1%. According to forecasts by the [[Statistics Poland|Central Statistical Office]], Bielsko-Biala is expected to have a population of 161,900 in 2025, 150,400 in 2035 and 133,300 in 2050.<ref name="population"/>

In the [[2021 Polish census]] 99.30% of the population of Bielsko-Biała (167,913 people) declared [[Polish people|Polish ethnicity]]. 2.30% declared another ethnicity (there were a possibility to declare dual ethnicity, so percentages do not add up to 100%), of which: 0.66% (1,108 people) [[Silesians|Silesian]], 0.21% (321 people) [[Germans|German]], 0.20% (335 people) [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], 0.19% (313 people) [[English people|English]] and 0.13% (222 people) [[Italians|Italian]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://stat.gov.pl/download/gfx/portalinformacyjny/pl/defaultaktualnosci/6536/10/1/1/przynaleznosc_narodowo-etniczna_-_dane_nsp_2021_dla_kraju_i_jednostek_podzialu_terytorialnego.xlsx|title= Przynależność narodowo-etniczna – dane NSP 2021 dla kraju i jednostek podziału terytorialnego|website= Główny Urząd Statystyczny|publisher= |access-date= 2023-12-31|quote=}}</ref> 99.70% of the population (168 582 people) speak [[Polish language|Polish]] at home.

==Sights==
[[File:Bielsko-Biała Rynek nocą 2.jpg|thumb|Market Square]]
The Old Town of Bielsko is located on the Town Hill. It is characterized by an oval urban layout with a regular street grid running out from the corners of the rectangular Market Square (''Rynek''), typical of towns founded in the 13th century under the [[Magdeburg Law]]. The external appearance of the buildings dates mainly from the first half of the 19th century, when the town was restored after the fires of 1808 and 1836. Among the most picturesque corners are Podcienie Street, where 18th-century arcades are still preserved, and Schodowa Street, which is a [[step street]]. Along Orkana, Waryńskiego and Zamkowa Street, fragments of the outer belt of [[town walls]] completed in the 16th century have been preserved.
[[File:Zamek Sulkowskich.jpg|thumb|Bielsko Castle]]
Within the Old Town are two iconic historic buildings: 
* [[Bielsko-Biała Museum and Castle|Bielsko Castle]], also known as the Castle of the Sułkowski Princes (''Zamek książąt Sułkowskich''), after the family that inhabited it from 1752 to 1945. The history of the castle dates back to the medieval frontier stronghold of the [[Duchy of Teschen|Dukes of Teschen]], but its current appearance is the result of an [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] reconstruction carried out in 1855–1864. It now houses the Historical Museum of Bielsko-Biala.
* [[Cathedral of St. Nicholas, Bielsko-Biała|Cathedral of St. Nicholas]], a Roman Catholic parish church located on the site since the Middle Ages, which was rebuilt to its present form in 1909–1912 according to a design by [[Leopold Bauer]]. In 1992, the church became the cathedral of the newly created [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bielsko–Żywiec|diocese of Bielsko and Żywiec]].
[[File:POL_Bielsko-Biała_Kościół_Zbawiciela_2.JPG|thumb|left|Church of the Saviour|upright=0.8]]
To the north of the Old Town lies the [[Bielsko Zion]] (''Bielski Syjon''), a [[Lutheran]] quarter founded after [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] issued the [[1782 Edict of Tolerance]]. There are important monuments associated with the Lutheran community here: the [[Church of the Saviour, Bielsko-Biała|Church of the Saviour]] (1782-1790, then extended several times in the 19th century, including between 1881 and 1882 by [[Heinrich Ferstel]]), the only [[Luther Monument in Bielsko-Biała|Luther Monument]] in present-day Poland, unveiled in 1900, a complex of school buildings from the 19th century, and the Old Lutheran Cemetery.
[[File:DOM TKACZA 3.jpg|thumb|The Weaver's House]]
To the west of the Old Town, along Cieszyńska and Sobieskiego Street, extends the [[Górne Przedmieście, Bielsko-Biała|Upper Suburb]] (''Górne Przedmieście''). It is a former clothmakers' quarter with characteristic small-town buildings. Particularly notable among them is the wooden [[Weaver's House Museum|Weaver's House]] with a museum dedicated to the life and work of the clothiers in the pre-industrial era. Somewhat tucked away in Zdrojowa Street stands one of the oldest still preserved villas of Bielsko's rich factory owners - the [[Neo-Renaissance]] Villa Bartelmuss from 1872.
[[File:Bielsko-Biała,_pałacyk_Michla.jpg|thumb|The Michl's House, an example of a neo-Baroque townhouse at 3 Maja Street, built in 1895, and the former seat of the Jewish community from 1904 (on the left)]]
[[File:Kamienica_Patria.jpg|thumb|left|Former Municipal Savings Bank]]
The [[Dolne Przedmieście, Bielsko-Biała|Lower Suburb]] (''Dolne Przedmieście''), which extends to the north, is dominated by the turn-of-the-20th-century architecture. This is where the greatest concentration of [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] and [[Art Nouveau]] buildings to which Bielsko-Biała owes the term "Little Vienna" is to be found: the own house of the architect [[Carl Korn]] (1883), [[Villa Sixt]] (1883), Jędrzej Śniadecki School of Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Engineering (originally "the High Schools Building", 1883), the former Municipal Savings Bank (''Komunalna Kasa Oszczędności'', 1889, with an extension of 1901 by [[Max Fabiani]] and another extension of 1908–1910), [[Bielsko-Biała Główna railway station|Main Train Station]] (1890), [[Polish Theatre, Bielsko-Biała|Theatre]] (1890), [[Hotel President, Bielsko-Biała|Hotel President]] (1893), [[Main Post Office, Bielsko-Biała|Main Post Office]] (1898), the former district office (1903, now one of the seats of the Regional Court), [[Villa Schneider]] (1904), [[Bielska Szkoła Przemysłowa|Bielsko Industrial School]] (''Bielska Szkoła Przemysłowa'', 1912). Architecturally valuable are the complexes of the bourgeois townhouses along [[3 Maja Street, Bielsko-Biała|3 Maja]], [[11 Listopada Street, Bielsko-Biała|11 Listopada]], [[Norberta Barlickiego Street, Bielsko-Biała|Barlickiego]] or [[Adama Mickiewicza Street|Mickiewicza]] Street. [[Bolesława Chrobrego Square, Bielsko-Biała|Bolesława Chrobrego Square]], commonly known as ''Pigal'', stretching between the Bielsko Castle and the former Municipal Savings Bank, is the de facto central square of the city today. A much lesser role is now played by [[Franciszka Smolki Square, Bielsko-Biała|Franciszka Smolki Square]] which is the historic Lower Market.

The axis of the historic centre of [[Biała, Bielsko-Biała|Biała]] is the right bank section of [[11 Listopada Street, Bielsko-Biała|11 Listopada Street]], laid out in the 1780s. Numerous townhouses representing the so-called Josephine style (named after [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]) with [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] features have been preserved along it. The street, which today serves as the main promenade, passes through two of Biała's historic markets: [[Wojska Polskiego Square, Bielsko-Biała|Wojska Polskiego Square]] (delineated in 1723) and [[Wolności Square, Bielsko-Biała|Wolności Square]] (delineated in the 1780s). The two main churches in Biała also date from the late 18th century: the Lutheran [[Church of Martin Luther, Bielsko-Biała|Church of Martin Luther]] (1782–1788) and the Roman Catholic [[Church of the Divine Providence, Bielsko-Biała|Church of the Divine Providence]] (1769, expanded in the 19th century). The Lutheran church is located next to Wojska Polskiego Square, while the Catholic church is on what used to be outskirts of the town, near the border with [[Lipnik, Bielsko-Biała|Lipnik]].
[[File:Bielsko-Biała Ratusz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Bielsko-Biała City Hall]]
[[Bielsko-Biała City Hall|Biała's Town Hall]], built between 1895 and 1897 in [[Neo-Renaissance]] style according to a design by [[Emanuel Rost Junior]], today serves as the City Hall for the combined city. Other important architectural monuments from the turn of the 20th century in Biała are: the former Polish elementary school at Legionów Street (1898), Jakubecki House at 51 Stojałowskiego Street (1903, by [[Leopold Bauer]]), [[Frog House]] (''Kamienica Pod Żabami'', 1903, a prominent example of [[Art Nouveau]]), [[Pedagogical Library, Bielsko-Biała|Pedagogical Library]] (1903, originally the villa of the architect Emanuel Rost Junior), the [[Hotel Pod Orłem|former hotel Under the Eagle]] (''Hotel Pod Orłem'', 1904) and the Economic High School (''Zespół Szkół Ekonomicznych'', 1910, originally the Polish Teachers' Seminary).
[[File:Bielsko-Biała, Bohaterów Warszawy.jpg|thumb|Bohaterów Warszawy Street]]
The architecture of the [[interwar period]] also plays an important role in the cityscape. The largest concentration of early [[Modern architecture|Modernist housing]] is in the area of Bohaterów Warszawy, Wilsona and Grota-Roweckiego Street, which has been built up since 1934 (before that, the castle gardens stretched here). The public buildings of the 1920s and 1930s include: [[Nicolaus Copernicus High School, Bielsko-Biała|Nicolaus Copernicus High School]] (''Liceum Kopernika'', 1925–1927), a complex of buildings at the intersection of [[Teodora Sixta Street, Bielsko-Biała|Sixta]] and [[Zygmunta Krasińskiego Street, Bielsko-Biała|Krasińskiego]] Street (1922–1930), the fire station on [[Grunwaldzka Street, Bielsko-Biała|Grunwaldzka Street]] (1928), and the new headquarters of the Municipal Savings Bank on the other side of [[Bolesława Chrobrego Square, Bielsko-Biała|Bolesława Chrobrego Square]] (1938).
[[File:Stara_Fabryka_Muzeum_w_Bielsku-Białej.jpg|thumb|The Old Factory Museum with a related mural]]
Old [[industrial architecture|industrial buildings]] intersect with urban development in many places, especially in the [[Dolne Przedmieście, Bielsko-Biała|Lower Suburb]] near the Biała River, in the [[Żywieckie Przedmieście, Bielsko-Biała|Żywiec Suburb]] (''Żywieckie Przedmieście''), which is the southern part of Bielsko, and in [[Biała, Bielsko-Biała|Biała]].

[[File:Bielsko-Biała,_dworzec_autobusowy_02.jpg|thumb|Bus station]]
The public transport system in the city has been in existence since 1895. Until 1972 it included a [[Trams in Bielsko-Biała|tram network]], and since 1927 also a bus network which is currently the only one.

The main carrier is ''Miejski Zakład Komunikacyjny w Bielsku-Białej'' (Municipal Transport Company of Bielsko-Biała, MZK), which in 2023 served transport on 40 daily and two night bus lines. Four of them went outside the city limits: to [[Czechowice-Dziedzice]], [[Bystra, Bielsko County|Bystra]], [[Wilkowice, Bielsko County|Wilkowice]] and [[Janowice, Silesian Voivodeship|Janowice]]. Some stops in Bielsko-Biała are also served by three lines of ''PKM Czechowice-Dziedzice'', a municipal bus company from the neighbouring town, marked with numbers 5, VII and X (to distinguish from "7" and "10" of MZK). The fares and timetables of the two carriers are not coordinated.

Regional bus transport within the [[Bielsko County]], as well as towards [[Kęty]], [[Andrychów]] and [[Chybie]], is operated by ''Komunikacja Beskidzka'' established in 2021 as a result of the transformation of the former [[Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacji Samochodowej|PKS]] Bielsko-Biała. The bus station from which the KB lines (numbered from 100 upwards) and long-distance bus connections depart, is located at Warszawska Street opposite the Bielsko-Biała Główna railway station.

There also small private bus companies operating in the region, e.g. ''Linea Trans'' with services to [[Strumień]] and to [[Cieszyn]] via [[Skoczów]], ''Konkret Bus'' for [[Brzeszcze]] and [[Oświęcim]], or ''Żądło'' going to [[Szczyrk]]. Their stops are located near the station: at Warszawska, Podwale and Wałowa Street.

===Airports===
There are 3 international airports within the 90&nbsp;km distance from Bielsko-Biała, all serving connections with major European cities:
[[Katowice International Airport]], [[John Paul II International Airport Kraków–Balice|Kraków John Paul II International Airport]], [[Leoš Janáček Airport Ostrava|Ostrava Leoš Janáček Airport]].

In [[Aleksandrowice, Bielsko-Biała|Aleksandrowice]] there is an airport with a unpaved runway used by the Aeroclub of Bielsko-Biała for sports purposes. Another airport in the vicinity is [[Bielsko-Biała Kaniów Airport]], which is part of the Bielsko-Biała Technology Park of Aviation, Entrepreneurship and Innovation.
