'''Shah Alam''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑː|_|ˈ|ɑː|l|ə|m|}}, from [[Arabic]] meaning "king of the world"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arabic-names.com/names/shah-alam |title=Name SHAH ALAM (شاه الأم) meaning in Arabic & English |website=arabic-names.com}}</ref>) is a city and the [[state capital]] of [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]] and situated within the [[Petaling District]] and a small portion of the neighbouring [[Klang District]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mbsa.gov.my/ms-my/infoshahalam/kenalishahalam/Halaman/lokasi_demografi.aspx | title=Lokasi dan Demografi }}</ref> Shah Alam replaced [[Kuala Lumpur]] as the capital city of the state of [[Selangor]] in 1978 due to Kuala Lumpur's incorporation into a [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] in 1974. Shah Alam was the first [[List of planned cities|planned city]] in Malaysia after [[Independence Day (Malaysia)|independence from Britain]] in 1957.

==History==
[[File:Shah Alam Expansion.svg|thumb|240px|left|Expansion of Shah Alam's municipal borders since gazettement as state capital in 1978.]]
Malaysia grew rapidly after its independence in 1957 under its second [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Allahyarham [[Tun Abdul Razak|Tun Abdul Razak Hussein]]. Shah Alam was once known as '''Sungai Renggam''' and was noted for its rubber and [[oil palm]] estates. Later, the same area was identified as [[Batu Tiga]] prior to Malaysian independence, and has been a centre of rubber and [[palm oil]] trade for centuries. The Sungai Renggam Plantation was earmarked for the development of a township by the Selangor government in 1963, and under the recommendations of Vlado Antolic, a town planning advisor from the United Nations, chose the present site strategically located between Kuala Lumpur and [[Port Klang]].<ref name=NST10a/><ref name="BFM">{{cite interview|title=Shah Alam - Selangor's Capital City|url=https://www.bfm.my/podcast/night-shift/i-love-kl/shah-alam-selangors-capital-city|publisher=[[BFM 89.9]]|date=Feb 2, 2023|interviewer=Haniff Baharuddin|first=Elizabeth|last=Cardosa}}</ref>

Its current name was chosen by the then state [[Sultan of Selangor]], [[Sultan Salahuddin|Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah]], after his late father [[Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah|Sultan Alam Shah]]. Many other monuments, buildings and even a street are named after the late Sultan. Shah Alam was opened in 1963 with the purpose of making it the new administrative centre of Selangor, replacing Kuala Lumpur which was made a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. With the consent of the Sultan, Shah Alam was proclaimed the capital of Selangor on 7 December 1978 with an initial area of 41.68&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and administered by a municipal council.

===Enlargement===
Shah Alam was enlarged several times between 1983 and 1997, the last annexation on 1 January 1997:
* 1983: Annexed Section 25-28 ([[Sri Muda (state constituency)|Sri Muda]]) from Petaling District Council; 11.41&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> annexed
* 1994: Annexed [[Setia Alam]], [[Bukit Jelutong]] and [[Subang Airport]] from Petaling District Council, and [[Kota Kemuning]] and [[Sungai Kandis (state constituency)|Sg Kandis]] from [[Klang Municipal Council]]; 208.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> annexed
* 1997: Annexed Paya Jaras and parts of [[Sungai Buloh]] from Petaling District Council, but ceded [[Putra Heights]] and Subang Hi-tech Industrial Park to [[Subang Jaya Municipal Council|Subang Jaya]]; 28.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> annexed
