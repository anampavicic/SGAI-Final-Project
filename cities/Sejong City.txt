'''Sejong''' or '''Sejong City''' ({{Korean|hangul=세종}}; {{IPA|ko|seːdʑoŋ|lang|Ko-세종.oga}}), officially '''Sejong Special Self-Governing City'''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Organization > Sejong City Hall > Happy City Sejong >|url=https://www.sejong.go.kr/eng/sub01_0301.do|website=www.sejong.go.kr|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> ({{Korean|labels=no|hangul=세종특별자치시}}), is a [[List of special cities of South Korea|special self-governing city]] and the ''de facto'' administrative capital of [[South Korea]].

Sejong was founded in 2007 as the new [[Planned community#Planned capitals|planned capital]] of South Korea from many parts of the [[South Chungcheong Province]] and some parts of [[North Chungcheong Province]] to ease congestion in South Korea's current capital and largest city, [[Seoul]], and encourage investment in the country's central region. Since 2012, the [[government of South Korea]] has relocated numerous ministries and agencies to Sejong, but many still reside in other cities, primarily Seoul, where the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] and many important government bodies remain.

Sejong has a population of 351,007 as of 2020 and covers a geographic area of 465.23 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (179.63 [[sq mi]]), making it the least-populous and smallest first-level [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|administrative division]] in South Korea. Sejong is located in the west-central [[Hoseo]] region, bordering South Chungcheong to the west, [[Daejeon]] to the south, and North Chungcheong to the east.

The construction of the city is expected to be completed in 2030, at which time 500,000 people are expected to live there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/05/113_114241.html|title=Mini-capital Sejong City opens|date=2012-07-01|website=[[The Korea Times]]|language=en|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref>

==Name==
Sejong was named in honor of King [[Sejong the Great]], the fourth king of the [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]] and creator of the Korean alphabet, [[Hangul]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3554296.stm|title=S Korea chooses new capital site|date=2004-08-11|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-GB}}</ref> The city was formed by combining [[Yeongi County]], the county of South Chungcheong Province from which the majority of the city's territory was ceded, and other counties.

== History ==

In 2003, then-President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] sought to relocate the national capital of [[South Korea]] from the metropolitan city of [[Seoul]] to a new multifunctional administrative city in the center of the country. The goal was to reduce the influence and dominance of Seoul on national governance and economics, whilst promoting the regional development of other areas of the country.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|title=Sejong City to open Sunday|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120628001115|website=[[The Korea Herald]]| date=28 June 2012 |access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> According to the former Interior Minister Maeng Hyung-gyu in 2012, "Sejong is a symbol of the country's efforts toward more balanced regional development," helping to decongest Seoul and spur investment in the country's central region.

In October 2004, the [[Constitutional Court of Korea|Constitutional Court]] dealt a setback to President Roh's plans, ruling that the capital must remain in Seoul in response to a complaint filed by the main opposition, the conservative [[Grand National Party]]. As such, the Roh administration was forced to modify the project to relocate the majority of government ministries and institutions to Sejong, which would become a special administrative city instead of a new capital. The revised plan was approved by the National Assembly in March 2005. Challenges to the new plan were rejected by the Constitutional Court in November 2005.<ref name="auto"/>

When the Grand National Party retook the presidential office in 2008, then-President [[Lee Myung-bak]] opposed the idea of moving government agencies, claiming that it would hurt Seoul's global competitiveness and result in inefficiency.<ref name="auto"/> Following Lee's directions, plans were made to make Sejong an industrial, science and education hub instead. This plan was opposed by many, including Roh's allies and some members of the ruling Grand National Party, including Lee's arch-rival and eventual successor, [[Park Geun-hye]]. Defeat in the mid-2010 local elections forced Lee to present his proposal to the National Assembly where it was voted down.

In December 2008, construction for the [[Government Complex, Sejong|Sejong Government Complex]] started. After level 1 of the construction was completed in November 2012, level 2 was finished in November 2013, and finished construction in November 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-08-16 |script-title=ko:소개<정부세종청사<정부청사관리본부 |url=https://gbmo.go.kr/chungsa/cm/cntnts/cntntsView.do?mi=1305&cntntsId=1130 |website=정부청사관리본부(Government Buildings Management Office)}}</ref>

In July 2012, Sejong Special Self-Governing City was created by combining all of '''Yeongi County''',<ref>{{Cite web |title=[Editorial] No Revisions, No Hope |url=https://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20100112/264199/1 |access-date=2024-03-22 |website=[[The Dong-A Ilbo]] |language=en}}</ref> three townships of [[Gongju]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2010011293448 |title=Sejong City to Become Biz Hub, Not Gov't District}}</ref> and one township of [[Cheongwon County]]. [[Jochiwon]] was the main city within Yeongi.

In April 2013, the city government of [[Putrajaya]], [[Malaysia]] signed a [[letter of intent]] (LOI) with the government of Sejong City to mark cooperation between the two planned capitals.<ref>{{Cite web|last=YEEN|first=OH ING|title=Closer ties between Putrajaya and Sejong, Korea|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2013/04/06/closer-ties-between-putrajaya-and-sejong-korea|access-date=2021-08-19|website=The Star|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-09-23|title=Malaysian envoy acclaims Sejong City|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/08/176_120656.html|access-date=2021-08-19|website=[[The Korea Times]]|language=en}}</ref>

Sejong was specifically designed to be a "[[smart city]]", and is sometimes referred to as '''Sejong smart city'''. It is the leading smart city in Korea, and is often held up as the standard for other cities experimenting with the development of smart city infrastructure<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] for a redirect to this article -->.<ref name=leem2019>{{cite book |last1=Leem|first1=Yountaik |last2=Han|first2=Hoon |last3=Lee|first3=Sang Ho |url=https://www.springerprofessional.de/computational-urban-planning-and-management-for-smart-cities/16712572 |title=Computational Urban Planning and Management for Smart Cities |chapter=2.

By 2019, there was disagreement among experts as to whether Sejong had "lived up to expectations. ...Sejong uses its new development to market itself as an alternative to Seoul, offering luxury living at a fraction of the cost. It boasts shiny state-of-the-art condominiums, ample public [[Greenway (landscape)|green space]] and [[Smart city|smart and sustainable city tech]], like automated trash collection and [[Zero waste|zero-waste]] food disposal, [[electric vehicle|electric car]] charging and sharing stations, solar-powered buildings, interactive digital signage, closed-circuit television security and fine dust emergency alerts.
