'''Abbottabad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|ə|t|ə|b|a:|d}} {{respell|AB|ə|tə|bahd}}; [[Urdu]] and {{lang-hk|{{Nastaliq|ایبٹ آباد}}|translit=aibṭabād}}, {{IPA|ur|ɛːbʈəˈbaːd|pron}}) is a city in the [[Hazara Division]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, Pakistan. It is the [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|40th largest city]] in the country and [[List of cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by population|6th largest]] in the province by population, and serves as the headquarter of its namesake [[Abbottabad Tehsil|tehsil]] and [[Abbottabad District|district]]. It is about {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Islamabad–Rawalpindi metropolitan area|Islamabad-Rawalpindi]] and {{convert|150|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} east of [[Peshawar]], at an elevation of {{convert|1256|m|ft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}. [[Azad Kashmir|Kashmir]] lies a short distance to the east.

==Etymology==
The name combines the name of the city founder, [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|Major James Abbott]], and the Persian ending [[Oikonyms in Western and South Asia#Ābād|''ābād'']], meaning "settlement, town of".

==History==
Following the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]], The [[British Empire|British]] annexed the entire [[Punjab region]] up to [[Peshawar]]. Abbottabad was founded in the early 1850s, by a British military officer in the [[Bengal Army]] of the [[British Raj]], [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|James Abbott]], and replaced [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]] as [[Hazara region|Hazara's]] capital.

On 9 November 1901, the British established a [[North-West Frontier Province]] from the north-western districts of [[Punjab Province (British India)|The Punjab]]. This meant that Abbottabad was now a part of the newly formed province.

Following the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Announcement of Partition of the British Raj]] into the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] and the [[Dominion of India]], [[1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum|a referendum was held in the NWFP]] and the result was in favor of Pakistan. In [[One Unit Scheme|1955]], Abbottabad and the whole NWFP became a part of [[West Pakistan]], but the province was established again in [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|1970]], and [[Hazara District]] and the two tribal agencies were merged to form the new [[Hazara Division]] with its capital at Abbottabad.

[[Osama bin Laden]], founder of the Islamist militant group [[al-Qaeda]], held refuge at [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|a compound]] in Abbottabad, where he was [[Killing of Osama bin Laden|shot and killed]] by [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. forces]] on 2 May 2011.

Established in 1947, Abbottabad houses the [[Pakistan Army]]'s initial officer training academy, the [[Pakistan Military Academy]], referred to by its acronym, PMA.

Abbottabad was founded and named after Major James Abbott in January 1853 as the headquarters of [[Hazara District]] during the [[British Raj]] after the annexation of [[Punjab region|Punjab]].<ref name=EB/> He remained the first Deputy Commissioner of the Hazara district from 1845 until April 1853. Major Abbott is noted for having written a poem titled "[[Abbottabad (poem)|Abbottabad]]", before his return to Britain, in which he wrote of his fondness for the town and his sadness at having to leave it. In 1849, Major Abbott, a Deputy Commissioner appointed by the British East Company, shifted Hazara Gojaran's headquarter from Haripur Gojaran to the newly established Abbottabad.

In the early 20th century, Abbottabad became an important military [[cantonment]] and [[sanatorium]], serving as the headquarters of a brigade in the Second Division of the Northern Army Corps.<ref name="EB1911">[[:wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Abbottabad|Abbottabad – Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref> The garrison consisted of four battalions of native infantry, of the Frontier Force (including the [[5th Gurkha Rifles]]) and two native mountain batteries.<ref name="IGI">{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_009.gif |title=Abbottabad Town – Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 5, p. 1 |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |access-date=17 December 2021| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110607080015/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_009.gif| archive-date= 7 June 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>
