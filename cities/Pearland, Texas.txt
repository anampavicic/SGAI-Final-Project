The city of Pearland is a principal city within the {{nowrap|[[Greater Houston|Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land]]}} metropolitan statistical area. At the [[2020 United States census|2020 U.S. census]], the city's population was 125,828,<ref name="Census 2010">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US4856348| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Pearland city, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| access-date=August 30, 2016}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> up from a population of 91,252 at the 2010 census.

Pearland is the third-largest city in the Greater Houston area after [[Houston]] and [[Pasadena, Texas]].<ref name="Pearland Demographic Overview">{{cite web|title=Pearland Demographic Overview|url=http://pearlandedc.com/media/docs/PearlandDemographics.pdf|access-date=May 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403154806/http://www.pearlandedc.com/media/docs/PearlandDemographics.pdf|archive-date=April 3, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Pearland had its beginnings near a siding switch on the [[Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway]] in 1882. When a post office was established in 1893, the community was named "Mark Belt". On September 24, 1894, the plat of "Pear-Land" was filed with the Brazoria County courthouse by Witold von Zychlinski, a man of [[Polish people|Polish]] nobility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pearlandhistoricalsociety.com/Photos_Zychlinski.html|title=Photos_Zychlinski|publisher=Pearlandhistoricalsociety.com|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref> At the time Pearland had many fruits harvested by residents. Zychlinski saw the pear trees and decided that "Pearland" would make a good name for the community.<ref name="GalehouseSmalltown"/>

In the 1800s, Pearland consisted of [[prairie]]. Residents harvested fruit and vegetables such as cantaloupes, corn, figs, pears and watermelons. Pearland was promoted by developers Allison & Richey Land Company as an "agricultural Eden". The first subdivision was called "Suburban Gardens".{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston hurricane of 1900]] and the [[1915 Galveston hurricane|Galveston hurricane of 1915]] destroyed most of the city's fruit trees and slowed growth for a considerable period of time, and caused a period of [[desertification]] in the area. In 1914, with agriculture rebounding and the end of desertification, Pearland had a population of 400, but a devastating freeze in 1918 was another setback to the local farming enterprises. Oil was discovered nearby in 1934, which led to the development of the Hastings Oilfield, though it did not spur much growth, as the population fluctuated between 150 and 350. In the 1930s and 1940s, Pearland had many [[dance hall]]s and beer joints that entertained people from the [[Hastings, Pearland, Texas|Hastings]] and [[Manvel, Texas|Manvel]] oil fields.<ref name="GalehouseSmalltown" />

From the 1970s, the town has grown to its present-day population. By 1990, the city limits had extended into [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]].<ref>"[https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hep03 Pearland, Texas]." ''[[Handbook of Texas]]''. Retrieved October 12, 2010.</ref> In the 1990s, home developers began buying large tracts of land, changing the geography of the city. Former rice fields filled with houses. The historic town center of Pearland is at the intersection of [[Texas State Highway 35]]/Main and Broadway. West Pearland has a lot of suburban development, while East Pearland has older houses and, according to Maggie Galehouse of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', Pearland's "rural roots still show" in the east side. Pearland's main east–west corridor is [[Farm to Market Road 518]]/Broadway.<ref name="GalehouseSmalltown" />

===Metro Park and Ride===
On December 5, 2011, The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County purchased {{convert|15.26|acre}} of land near Hwy. 288 and FM 518 in the Pearland area for a future "Park and Ride" facility. Alan Parker Properties LP represented the seller, Carolyn and Frank Wenglar, in the $3.95&nbsp;million land sale. Metro, which currently operates 29 Park and Rides throughout Harris County, said that the new facility will give Brazoria County residents another option for traveling to the [[Texas Medical Center]] and other downtown Houston destinations. The new facility was scheduled to begin operations in the fall of 2013, but property was given to the city in a cash swap.
