'''Maribor''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|m|ær|ɪ|b|ɔːr}} {{respell|MARR|ib|or}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|m|ɑːr|-}} {{respell|MAR|-}}, {{IPA|sl|ˈmáːɾibɔɾ|lang|Sl-Maribor.oga}}; also known by other [[#Name|historical names]]) is the [[List of cities and towns in Slovenia|second-largest city]] in [[Slovenia]] and the largest city of the traditional region of [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]]. It is the seat of the [[Urban Municipality of Maribor]] and the [[Drava Statistical Region|Drava statistical region]]. Maribor is also the economic, administrative, educational, and cultural centre of [[eastern Slovenia]].

Maribor was first mentioned as a castle in 1164, as a settlement in 1209, and as a city in 1254. Like most [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]], Maribor was under [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg]] rule until 1918, when [[Rudolf Maister]] and his men secured the city for the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which then joined the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. In 1991 Maribor became part of independent Slovenia.

Maribor, along with the Portuguese city of [[Guimarães]], was selected as the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2012.

==Name==
Maribor was attested in historical sources as ''Marpurch'' {{Circa| 1145}} (and later as ''Marchburch'', ''Marburc'', and ''Marchpurch''), and is a compound of [[Middle High German]] ''march'' '[[March (territorial entity)|march (borderland)]]' + ''burc'' 'fortress'. In modern times, the town's German name was ''Marburg an der Drau'' ({{IPA|de|ˈmaʁbʊʁk ʔan deːɐ̯ ˈdʁaʊ̯|pron}}; literally, 'Marburg on the [[Drava]]').<ref name="Zgodovina na dlani">{{cite web|url=https://zgodovinanadlani.si/1254-maribor-prvic-omenjen-kot-mesto/|title=Zgodovina na dlani|date=6 December 2018 }}</ref>

The Slovene name ''Maribor'' is an artificial Slovenized creation, coined by [[Stanko Vraz]] in 1836. Vraz created the name in the spirit of [[Illyrian movement|Illyrianism]] by analogy with the name ''[[Brandenburg]]'' (cf. [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]] ''Bramborska''). Locally, the town was known in Slovene as ''Marprk'' or ''Marprog''.<ref name="Snoj">{{cite book |last1=Snoj |first1=Marko |title=Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen |date=2009 |publisher=Modrijan |location=Ljubljana |page=252}}</ref> The name ''Maribor'' was accepted among Slovenes in 1861,<ref>{{cite web |title=Predstavitev mesta Maribor |url=https://maribor.si/moje-mesto/zgodovina-maribora/predstavitev-mesta-maribor/ |website=maribor.si |date=10 November 2018 |access-date=27 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230127163618/https://maribor.si/moje-mesto/zgodovina-maribora/predstavitev-mesta-maribor/ |archive-date=27 January 2023 |language=sl}}</ref> when [[Lovro Toman]] published a song named ''Mar i bor'', giving the name a Slovene compound ''Mar'' ('to care') + ''i'' ('and') + ''bor'' ('to fight for').<ref name="Maribor obeležuje 180. obletnico svojega imena">{{cite web|url=https://maribor24.si/lokalno/maribor-obelezuje-180-obletnico-svojega-imena/|title=Maribor obeležuje 180. obletnico svojega imena|date=15 November 2016|access-date=27 January 2023|language=sl|website=maribor24.si}}</ref> In addition to its Slovene and German names, the city is also known as ''Marburgum'' in Latin and ''Marburgo'' in Italian.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berk |first1=Sandi |title=O tujejezičnih ustreznicah za slovenska zemljepisna imena |journal=Geografski Vestnik |date=2001 |volume=73 |issue=1 |page=38}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Il siglario mondiale di enti e imprese economiche |date=1977 |publisher=Banca commerciale italiana |location=Milan |pages=1039, 1202}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Žgajnar |first1=Matija |title=Vojna in Osvobodilna fronta |work=Delo: Sobotna priloga |issue=116 |date=April 27, 1968 |page=13}}</ref>

===Prehistory===
The oldest known remnants of settlement in the Maribor area date back to the 5th millennium BC, at the time of the [[Chalcolithic]]. With the construction of Maribor's western bypass, larger settlements were discovered dating from the 44th to 42nd century BC. Another settlement from around the same period was also discovered in [[Spodnje Hoče]], a town right next to Maribor and another below Melje Hill near [[Malečnik]]. Another settlement below Melje Hill was also found dating to the 4th millennium BC.<ref name="Cresnar">{{cite book |last1=Črešnar |first1=Matija |title=Arheološka pot po Mariboru z okolico.

A more intense period of settlement of the Maribor area occurred in the 3rd millennium BC with the advent of the [[Bronze Age]]. In the 13th to 12th century BC, in the age of the [[Urnfield culture]], new settlements were found in [[Pekel, Maribor|Pekel]]. Around 1000 BC, new settlers moved to the Maribor area. An urnfield cemetery was found from that period in today's ''Mladinska ulica'' and another [[necropolis]] was also found in [[Pobrežje, Maribor|Pobrežje]].<ref name="Cresnar"/>

=== Antiquity ===
With the [[Iron Age]] and the [[Hallstatt Culture]], new settlements began to appear on hills. One of them was [[Poštela]] in the [[Pohorje]] Mountains. Poštela was an old town that was abandoned in the 6th century BC and inhabited again in the 2nd century BC.<ref name="Cresnar"/>

During [[Roman times]], the area where Maribor later developed was part of the province of [[Noricum]], right on the border with [[Pannonia]]. During that period, Roman agricultural estates known as ''[[villa rustica|villae rusticae]]'' filled the area around [[Radvanje]], [[Betnava]], [[Bohova, Hoče–Slivnica|Bohova]], and Hoče. The best-known of them was in today's [[Borova Vas]] neighborhood of Maribor.<ref name="Cresnar"/> An important trade route was also established in the area, connecting [[Celeia]] and [[Flavia Solva]] in one direction with [[Poetovio]] and central Noricum on the other.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kratka zgodovina mesta Maribor |url=https://www.visitmaribor.si/si/odkrij/maribor/pretekli-casi/ |website=Pretekli časi |publisher=TIC Maribor |access-date=14 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Medieval history ===
[[File:Vischer - Topographia Ducatus Stiria - 247 Marburg - Maribor.jpg|left|thumb|Maribor in the 17th century. A copper engraving by [[Georg Matthäus Vischer]], 1678.]]
After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Maribor area was settled by the [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavs]].<ref name="Stih">{{cite web |title=Slovenska zgodovina |url=http://www.sistory.si/publikacije/pdf/zgodovina/Stih-Slovenska_zgodovina_od_prazgodovinskih_kultur_do_konca_srednjega_veka.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319025304/http://www.sistory.si/publikacije/pdf/zgodovina/Stih-Slovenska_zgodovina_od_prazgodovinskih_kultur_do_konca_srednjega_veka.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 19, 2009 |website=Slovenska zgodovina |publisher=Peter Štih |access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref>
A Slavic cemetery was found in Radvanje dating to the 10th century AD.<ref name="Cresnar"/> The area of what later became Maribor was first part of [[Samo's Empire]] and later the area stood on the border between [[Carantania]] and [[Pannonian Slavs#Principality|Lower Pannonia]]. In 843 the area was absorbed into the [[Frankish Empire]].<ref name="Zgodovina Maribora">{{cite web|url=http://www.maribor.si/povezava.aspx?pid=3792|title=Zgodovina Maribora}}</ref>

In the Frankish Empire, the area again stood on the border, this time between the Frankish Empire and the [[Principality of Hungary]]. To protect the Frankish Empire from Hungarian raids, a castle was built on [[Pyramid (Maribor)|Pyramid Hill]].<ref name="Maribor 850 let">{{cite web |title=Maribor 850 let |url=http://www.maribor.si/podrocje.aspx?id=238 |website=Mestna občina Maribor }}</ref> The castle was mentioned for the first time on 20 October 1164 as ''Castrum Marchburch''. A settlement soon began to grow below the castle. Maribor was first mentioned as a market near the castle in 1204, and it received [[town privileges]] in 1254.<ref name="Zgodovina Maribora"/> It is likely that the castle stood before 1164 because [[Bernard of Trixien]], the count of the region, already used the title ''Bernhard von Marchpurg'' 'Bernard of Maribor' in 1124.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Curk |first1=Jože |title=Maribor |journal=Časopis Za Zgodovino in Narodopisje |date=1966 |volume=38 |issue=2 |page=67 |url=https://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/6001-7000/6974/1966_2_Casopis_za_zgodovino_in_narodopisje.pdf#page=1 |access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/novice/castrum-marchburch-850-let-od-prve-omembe-maribora/348675 |title=Castrum Marchburch, 850 let od prve omembe Maribora |language=sl |trans-title=Castrum Marchburch, 850 Years since the First Mention of Maribor |work=MMC RTV Slovenija |date=14 October 2014}}</ref>
[[File:Vischer - Topographia Ducatus Stiria - 249 Marburg - Maribor.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Maribor Castle]]. A copper engraving by [[Georg Matthäus Vischer]].]]
The town began to grow rapidly after the victory of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]] over King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Otakar II]] of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] in 1278. The town built fortifications, and trade, viticulture, and crafts started to grow. The town had a monopoly over the entire region and also controlled the viticulture trade with [[Carinthia]]. The first churches were built, and also around this time the first [[Jews]] arrived. The Jews built their own ghetto in the southeastern part of town, where they also built the [[Maribor Synagogue]]. Most Slovenians lived in the northwestern part of town on what is now Slovenian Street (''Slovenska ulica'').

In 1478, a second castle was built on the northeastern side of the town, today known as [[Maribor Castle]]. In 1480 and in 1481, [[Matthias Corvinus]] besieged the town but failed to conquer it on both occasions.<ref name="Zgodovina Maribora" /> In 1496, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] issued a decree to expel all Jews from Maribor and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]].<ref name="Bell2001">{{Cite book |last=Dean Phillip Bell |title=Sacred Communities: Jewish and Christian Identities in Fifteenth-Century Germany |publisher=BRILL |year=2001 |isbn=0-391-04102-9 |page=119}}</ref> In 1515, the [[Maribor Town Hall]] was built and a few years later, in 1532, Maribor again came under siege, this time by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the battle that became known as the [[Siege of Maribor (1532)|Siege of Maribor]], a 100,000-strong Ottoman army under the leadership of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] attacked the town, which was defended only by the local garrison and its citizens. Despite all the odds, Maribor was defended and the legend of the Maribor shoemaker who raised the sluice gates and flooded the Ottoman army is still popular today.<ref name="Zgodovina Maribora" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/knjige/o-tem-kako-je-pogumni-cevljarcek-resil-maribor/230755|title=Cevljarcek Maribor}}</ref>

===Modern period===
In the 17th century, numerous fires razed the town. The biggest ones occurred in 1601, 1645, 1648, and 1700.

After the collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Maribor was claimed by both the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and [[Republic of German-Austria|German Austria]]. On 1 November 1918, a meeting was held by Colonel Anton Holik in the Melje barracks, where it was decided that the city would be part of German Austria. Ethnic Slovene Major [[Rudolf Maister]], who was present at the meeting, denounced the decision and organised Slovenian military units that were able to seize control of the city.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bruno Hartman<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Prevrat v Mariboru |date=2002 }}</ref> All Austrian officers and soldiers were disarmed and demobilised to the new state of German Austria.

On 27 January 1919, Austrian Germans gathered to await the [[United States]] peace delegation at the city's marketplace were fired upon by Slovenian troops.

In turn Slovene witnesses such as Maks Pohar claimed that the Austrian Germans attacked the Slovenian soldiers guarding the town hall, one even discharging a revolver and hitting one Slovenian soldier in the bayonet.<ref name=Casopis />{{rp|141}} The German-language media called the incident ''[[Marburg's Bloody Sunday]]''. As Maribor was now firmly in the hands of the Slovenian forces and surrounded completely by Slovenian territory; the city had been recognised as part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] without a [[Referendum|plebiscite]] in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 10 September 1919 between the victors and German Austria.

After 1918, most of Maribor's Austrian Germans left the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for [[Austria]].

==Geography==

===Topography===
On the [[Drava|Drava River]] lies Maribor Island ({{lang|sl|Mariborski otok}}). The oldest public bath, still an important and often visited place in Maribor, is located on the island.

There are two hills in Maribor: Calvary Hill and Pyramid Hill, both surrounded by vineyards. The latter dominates the northern border of the city. Ruins of the first Maribor castle from the 11th century and a chapel from the 19th century also stand there. The hill offers an easily accessible [[overlook|scenic overlook]] of Maribor and the countryside to the south over the Drava River.

===City districts===
The city of Maribor is divided into 11 districts ({{langx|sl|mestne četrti}}) of the [[City Municipality of Maribor]]. The [[Drava|Drava River]] separates the districts of Center, Koroška Vrata, and Ivan Cankar to the north from other districts south of it. The various city districts are connected by [[List of bridges in Maribor|four road bridges, a rail bridge, and a pedestrian bridge]].

==Architecture==

[[File:Maribor Rotovž.jpg|thumb|Maribor Town Hall]]
Many historical structures stand in Maribor. Of the remains of city walls surrounding the old downtown, the most prominent are the [[Judgement Tower]], the [[Maribor Water Tower|Water Tower]], and the Jewish Tower. [[Maribor Cathedral]] was built in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] in the 13th century. [[Maribor Synagogue]] was built in the 14th century, and is the second oldest synagogue of Europe. Today it serves as a centre for cultural activities. Other prominent Medieval buildings are [[Maribor Castle]], [[Betnava Mansion|Betnava Castle]], and the ruins of [[Upper Maribor Castle]] on Pyramid Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maribor-pohorje.si/defence-towers.aspx |title=Slovenia-Maribor: Defence Towers |website=Maribor-pohorje.si |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> [[Maribor Town Hall|Town Hall]] was constructed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], and the [[Plague Column (Maribor)|Plague Column]] in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]].

At the start of the 21st century, plans were made for a new modern business, residential and entertainment district, called the [[Dravska Vrata|Drava Gate]] ({{lang|sl|Dravska vrata}}) and nicknamed the ''Maribor Manhattan''. The project includes many new exclusive residential apartments, offices and conference halls, a green and recreational space, and other structures. It also includes a {{convert|111|m|abbr=on}} tall skyscraper that would be the tallest building in Slovenia. Due to lack of finances, the project has been postponed.

In 2008, the [[Studenci Footbridge]] ({{lang|sl|Studenška brv}}) was renovated according to the design of the Ponting company. The design was awarded that year at the 3rd International Footbridge Conference in [[Porto]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Studenška brv prejela nagrado na konferenci Footbridge |url=https://www.sta.si/1301654/studenska-brv-prejela-nagrado-na-konferenci-footbridge |website=sta.si |publisher=[[Slovenian Press Agency]] |access-date=30 April 2021 |language=sl |date=12 July 2008}}</ref>

In 2010, Maribor organised an international architectural competition ''ECC Maribor 2012 – Drava 2012'' to gather proposals for the design and reconstruction of the Drava banks, the construction of a new art gallery, and for a new footbridge. Its jury received about 400 proposals for the three different projects. The footbridge and the river embankments will be built in the near future, but the art gallery was replaced with a cultural center [[MAKS (cultural centre)|MAKS]], which is currently under construction.

The construction of a new modern [[Faculty of Medicine (Maribor)|Faculty of Medicine]] started in 2011 near the Drava River. It was designed by architect [[Boris Podrecca]] and was completed in 2013.

There are plans to renovate the [[Maribor Public Library]] and [[Town Hall Square (Maribor)|Town Hall Square]] ({{lang|sl|Rotovški trg}}). In addition, the renovation of [[Maribor Island]] ({{lang|sl|Mariborski otok}}) in the Drava River has been planned.

=== Catholic Church ===
[[File:MP stolnica.JPG|thumb|Maribor Cathedral]]
Maribor, previously in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau|Diocese of Graz-Seckau]], became part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lavant|Diocese of Lavant]] on 1 June 1859, and the seat of its [[Prince-bishop|Prince-Bishop]]. The name of the diocese (after a river in [[Carinthia]]) was later changed to the Diocese of Maribor on 5 March 1962. It was elevated to an [[archdiocese]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 7 April 2006.

===Jewish community===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Slovenia|Maribor Synagogue}}
[[File:Synagogue in Maribor Slovenia.JPG|thumb|Maribor Synagogue]]
Jewish people living in Maribor were first mentioned in 1277. It is suggested that at that time there was already a Jewish quarter in the city. The Jewish ghetto was located in the southeastern part of the city and it comprised, at its peak, several main streets in the city centre including part of the main city square. The ghetto had a [[Maribor Synagogue|synagogue]], a Jewish cemetery and also a [[Talmud]] school. The Jewish community of Maribor was numerically at its apex around 1410. After 1450 the circumstances changed dramatically: increasing competition that coincided with an economic crisis dealt a severe blow to the economic activities that were crucial to their economic success. According to a decree issued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian&nbsp;I]] in 1496, Jews were forced to leave the city of Maribor. Restrictions on settlement and business for Jews remained in place until 1861.<ref>[http://www.jewishcommunity.si/jss/ENG-zgodovina.asp Jewish community of Slovenia]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128114733/http://www.jewishcommunity.si/jss/ENG-zgodovina.asp |date=January 28, 2010 }}</ref> From late spring 1941, after Lower Styria was annexed by the Third Reich, the Jews of Maribor were deported to concentration camps.
