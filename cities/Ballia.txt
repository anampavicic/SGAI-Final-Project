'''Ballia''' is a city with a [[municipal board]] in the Indian [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The eastern boundary of the city lies at the junction of two major rivers, the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] and the [[Ghaghara River|Ghaghara]]. The city is situated {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Varanasi]] and about 380&nbsp;km from the state capital [[Lucknow]]. It is home to a protected area, the [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] bird sanctuary. Ballia is around {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} from [[Bihar]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Ballia'' is an ancligised spelling of Hindi ''Baliyā'' ([[Devanagari]]: बलिया).<!-- Whalley 1927, p. 56 --> According to Paul Whalley, the name is derived from the personal name ''[[Bali (name)|Bali]]'' along with the suffix ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-आ -ā]''.<!-- Whalley 1927, p. 56 --> The "y" in the name is a [[glide (linguistics)|glide]] inserted between the vowels to make it easier to pronounce; the resulting similarity to the diminutive suffix ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-इया -iyā]'' is only coincidental.<ref name="Whalley 1927">{{cite journal |last1=Whalley |first1=Paul |title=Place-Names in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, Chapter III, Section 2: Suffixes |journal=The Journal of the United Provinces Historical Society |date=1927 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=52–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwdDAAAAYAAJ |access-date=22 July 2023}}</ref>{{rp|56}}

According to locals, the name Ballia was derived from the name of the sage [[Valmiki]], the author of [[Ramayana]]. Valmiki resided here at one point, and the place was commemorated by a shrine (although it has long since been washed away). Another belief about the origin of the name is that it refers to the [[sand]]y quality of the soil, locally known as "Ballua" (''balu'' meaning sand).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballia.nic.in/|title=District Profile|access-date=26 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080242/http://ballia.nic.in/profile.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
Ballia district is the easternmost part of the [[Uttar Pradesh]] state and borders on [[Bihar]] State. It comprises an irregularly shaped tract extending westward from the confluence of the [[Ganga]] and the [[Ghaghra]], the former separating it from Bihar in the south and the latter from [[Deoria district|Deoria]] and Bihar in the north and east respectively. The boundary between Ballia and Bihar is determined by the deep streams of these two rivers. It is bounded on the west by [[Mau, Uttar Pradesh|Mau]], on the north by Deoria, on the north-east and south-east by Bihar and on the south-west by [[Ghazipur]]. The district lies between the parallels of 25º33' and 26º11' North latitudes and 83º38' and 84º39' East longitudes. Ballia is among the least forest covered districts in [[India]].
