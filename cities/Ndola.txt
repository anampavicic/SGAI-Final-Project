'''Ndola''' is the third largest city in [[Zambia]] in terms of size and population, with a population of 627,503 (''2022 census''),<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Zambia: Provinces, Major Cities & Urban Centers - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/zambia/cities/ |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> after the capital, [[Lusaka]], and [[Kitwe]], and the second largest in terms of infrastructure development after Lusaka. It is the [[Industrial city|industrial]] and [[Commerce|commercial]] center of the [[Copperbelt]], Zambia's [[copper extraction|copper-mining]] region, and capital of [[Copperbelt Province]]. It lies just {{convert|10|km}} from the border with [[DR Congo]]. It is also home to Zambia's first modern stadium, the [[Levy Mwanawasa Stadium]].
[[File:Ndola,_The_Friendly_City.jpg|thumb|A sign on the [[T3 road (Zambia)|T3 road]] depicting Ndola as The Friendly City]]

==History==

What is now Ndola was first inhabited by the [[Lamba people (Zambia)|Lamba people]] led by Senior Chief Chiwala, the Lamba people migrated from the Luba-Lunda kingdom around 1600 and the town of Ndola was under Chief Mushili for some time but now it is under Chief Chiwala who came to the Lambaland during the slave trade from Malawi. The name Ndola is derived from the river, which originates in the Kaloko Hills and drains in the [[Kafubu River (Zambia)|Kafubu River]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://paulshalala.blogspot.com/2016/11/how-city-of-ndola-got-its-name.html |title=How The City Of Ndola Got Its Name |date=24 November 2016 |access-date=2019-01-04 |archive-date=2019-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104231225/http://paulshalala.blogspot.com/2016/11/how-city-of-ndola-got-its-name.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The town of Ndola was founded in 1904 by [[Chiripula Stephenson|John Edward "Chiripula" Stephenson]].{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} It was started as a [[Boma (enclosure)|boma]] and [[trading post]], which laid its foundations as an administrative and trading centre today.

The [[Rhodesia Railways]] main line reached the town in 1907, providing passenger services as far south as [[Bulawayo]], with connections to [[Cape Town]].<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Ndola Ndola] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214202237/https://www.britannica.com/place/Ndola |date=2019-12-14 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019</ref>
The line was extended into [[DR Congo]] and from there eventually linked to the [[Benguela Railway]] to the [[Atlantic]] [[port]] of [[Lobito]] (which took some of Zambia's copper [[exports]] for many years with recent interruptions by closures; the rail line is now back in service). The Ndola railhead was responsible for the town becoming the country's centre of distribution. Before the road network was built up in the 1930s, a track from Ndola to Kapalala on the [[Luapula River]], and [[Water Transport in Zambia|boat transport]] from there to the [[Chambeshi River]] was the principal trade route for the [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]], which consequently formed part of Ndola's [[hinterland]].

In 1961, an aeroplane carrying key [[United Nations]] figures, including the organisation's second Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|crashed on the outskirts of Ndola]].

==Climate==
Ndola has a moderate [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen Cwa).

===Legacy===
Once the largest industrial centre of Zambia, boasting, among many high-powered sites, company facilities including a Land Rover vehicle assembly plant, Dunlop Tire manufacture, Johnson & Johnson, and Unilever, Ndola's economy shrank significantly between 1980 and 2000. Many closed factories and plants lie unoccupied in the town. A number of former industries such as clothing and vehicle assembly have disappeared completely.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3735989.stm BBC World Service Website: "The last shirt maker in Ndola".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050915231824/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3735989.stm |date=2005-09-15 }} David Lyon, 22 May 2004. Accessed 18 March 2007.</ref> Even though the term 'ghost town' can no longer apply to it, Ndola is yet to regain its economic glory of pre-1980 days.

===Refining===
There are no [[mining|mines]] in Ndola itself, but the [[Bwana Mkubwa]] open-cast mine is only 10&nbsp;km south-east of the city centre. Until their closure, [[copper]] and [[precious metals]] used to be brought from elsewhere in the Copperbelt for processing at the Ndola Copper [[Refining (metallurgy)|Refinery]] and Precious Metals Refinery. Copper exports provide 70–80% of Zambia's export earnings, making the city very important to the country's economy.

The Indeni Oil Refinery in Ndola supplies the whole country with refined petroleum. It was repaired in 2001 after being severely damaged by fire in 1999. GL Africa Energy, through its subsidiary Ndola Energy Company Limited, provides 105MW of power to the National Grid of Zambia. Power is generated from [[heavy fuel oil]] supplied by the Indeni Petroleum refinery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glaenergy.com/projects.html|title=Great Lakes Africa Energy {{!}} Our Projects|website=www.glaenergy.com|access-date=2017-04-05|archive-date=2017-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406111429/http://www.glaenergy.com/projects.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glaenergy.com/projects.html|title=Great Lakes Africa Energy {{!}} Our Projects|website=www.glaenergy.com|access-date=2017-07-07|archive-date=2019-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416172446/https://www.glaenergy.com/projects.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Commercial===
Ndola is home to one of the country's national newspapers, the ''[[Times of Zambia]]'', as well as its printer, Printpak. These run as one company called ''TimesPrintpak''. Catholic church run printing press, ''Mission Press'', is also located in Ndola. Mission Press operates as a commercial entity.

===Limestone===
Ndola has huge [[limestone]] reserves which are believed to be among the most homogeneous of their kind in the world{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Limestone has therefore become to Ndola's economy what copper is to the rest of the country, providing much of the wealth and employment (Lime is a major component in the production of cement; a cement plant getting its lime from limestone and manufacturing a limestone cement will consume well over 80&nbsp;kg limestone per 100&nbsp;kg of cement produced).

Between 1974 and 2009, Ndola supplied over 50% of Zambia's cement from a plant located some 5&nbsp;km south-east of the heart of the city. This plant was called Chilanga Cement, Ndola Works. The parent company then was Chilanga Cement plc. Chilanga Cement ran two plants in Zambia: one built in 1949 at Chilanga (hence the parent company name) and the other built in 1969 at Ndola. In 2008, the new holding company, Lafarge Cement Zambia, completed construction of a brand new plant at Chilanga which would produce about double the volume of Ndola Works. By mid-2009, the new plant was still gathering momentum toward full production capacity, leaving Ndola still a significant player in the region's cement industry. Nonetheless, the combination of huge limestone deposits and existing transport infrastructure passing through Ndola has kept the city a very attractive destination for investment into cement production and related activities.

A second [[Cement in Africa|cement works]] is under construction in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&aid=32&dir=2008/June/Thursday26 |title=Mmegi Online :: Nigerian magnate invests in Kafue cement plant |date=27 April 2007 |publisher= |accessdate=17 December 2017 |archive-date=22 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522183307/http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&aid=32&dir=2008/June/Thursday26 |url-status=live }}</ref> In June 2009, countrywide advertisements were published to finalise staffing for this new cement plant.

Another important processing plant that is based on limestone in the area is Ndola Lime. It is Zambia's sole producer of Lime{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Ndola Lime is located near the two cement manufacturing facilities. It supplies the mining industry as well as farmers who require agricultural lime. Ndola Lime company is wholly owned by ZCCM Investment Holdings, a parastatal holdings company via which Zambia's government maintains its active interest in the country's mining and closely related heavy industry.

===Cultural interactions===
The four processing plants (the cement plants, the lime plant and [[Bwana Mkubwa]]) have mining rights on land located very close to the traditional Chiefdom of Chiwala. Chief Chiwala is therefore a significant interested party to Ndola industry and economics.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Electrical engineering===
Egyptian company [[Elsewedy Electric]] joined a consortium of local companies led by ZESCO Ltd (Zambia's electricity supply authority), and established a transformer manufacturing plant and an electrical meter manufacturing plant in Zambia in 2008. Both these facilities are located about 5&nbsp;km south of Ndola city centre.

==Transport==
The city is served by the operating sections of the [[Cape to Cairo Railway]]. The railway operator [[Zambia Railways]] maintains a railway station in Ndola, with passenger and freight services to the city of [[Kitwe]] to the north-west and the cities of [[Kabwe]], [[Lusaka]] and [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] to the south.<ref name="ITM">Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: "Zambia, 2nd edition", 2000</ref> Freight rail lines run to other Copperbelt towns and from Ndola to [[Lubumbashi]] in [[DR Congo]] via [[Sakania]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lobito Corridor – progress update {{!}} News {{!}} IJGlobal |url=https://www.ijglobal.com/articles/177000/lobito-corridor-progress-update |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=www.ijglobal.com}}</ref><ref name="ITM" />

Ndola is on the [[T3 road (Zambia)|T3 road]], which connects to [[Kitwe]] in the north-west (as a dual carriageway) and to [[Kapiri Mposhi]] and [[Lusaka]] in the south.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Roads and Road Traffic Act {{!}} National Assembly of Zambia |url=https://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/1492 |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=www.parliament.gov.zm}}</ref><ref name="ITM"/> The [[M4 road (Zambia)|M4 road]] connects Ndola to [[Mufulira]] (and the [[Congo Pedicle]]) in the north.<ref name=":3" />

[[Image:2013-04-08 10-04-21 Zambia Copperbelt - Malabo.JPG|thumb|[[Peter Zuze Air Force Base|Old Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport]]]]

[[Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport]], currently located 15&nbsp;km west of the city centre (adjacent to the [[Dag Hammarskjöld Crash Site Memorial]]),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia: Airlines to shift operations to new airport in Ndola Oct. 7 |url=https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2021/10/zambia-airlines-to-shift-operations-to-new-airport-in-ndola-oct-7 |access-date=2022-05-23 |website=Zambia: Airlines to shift operations to new airport in Ndola Oct. 7 {{!}} Crisis24 |language=en}}</ref> has scheduled domestic services to Lusaka and international services to [[Addis Ababa]], [[Johannesburg]] and [[Nairobi]]. It is one of the country's four international airports, others being [[Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport|Livingstone]], [[Kenneth Kaunda International Airport|Lusaka]] and [[Mfuwe Airport|Mfuwe]].

The [[Tazama Pipeline]] from [[Dar es Salaam]] terminates at the [[Indeni Petroleum Refinery]] in the town.

==Sport and recreation==
As with many towns on the Copperbelt, Ndola's sports and recreation life was heavily supported by the now disbundled mining conglomerate, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM). With the demise of ZCCM, many facilities deteriorated fast. Nevertheless, significant sports places are Ndola Tennis Club (membership), Ndola Swimming Pool (public), the Kanini area (about 3&nbsp;km from city centre and home to several sports clubs and playing fields like Ndola Wanderers Football Club, a rugby club, and others). About 10&nbsp;km north-west of the city centre, there is a motor racing track popular with weekend motorbike enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |last=Galpin |first=Darren |title=Ndola |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/tracks/africa/ndola.html |work=GEL Motorsport Information Page |accessdate=24 April 2013 |archive-date=26 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426161227/http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/tracks/africa/ndola.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has several recreational green parks which enjoy a very basic level of maintenance and are open to the public. Of particular significance is the [[Dag Hammarskjöld Crash Site Memorial]] located some 10&nbsp;km west-north-west of Ndola city centre. [[Dag Hammarskjöld Stadium]], which was located on the banks of the [[Kafubu River (Zambia)|Kafubu River]] south of the city, was razed in the 1980s. Its replacement, in the north-west of the city, is the [[Levy Mwanawasa Stadium]] with a seating capacity of 50,000. Ndola is home to [[ZESCO United F.C.|Zesco United]], a top-flight team in the Zambia Premier League. Zesco FC is nicknamed "team ya ziko", or the national team in the [[Nyanja language]].
