==History==
[[File:Suwa park exchange hall.jpg|thumb|left|Suwa park exchange hall]]
The area around modern Yokkaichi has been settled since prehistoric times. Numerous [[Kofun period]] [[kofun|burial mounds]] have been discovered, and the area was one of the battle sites of the [[Asuka period]] [[Jinshin War]]. However, until the end of the [[Heian period]], the area was sparsely settled, and the site of Yokkaichi was only a small port village. The area developed during the [[Kamakura period]] and by the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]], the port was developed and a regular market was opened on the 4th, 14th, and 24th day each month. Thus, the city is named Yokkaichi:  "yokka" means fourth day, and "ichi" means market.  After the [[Honnō-ji Incident]] during which warlord [[Oda Nobunaga]] was assassinated, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] fled from Yokkaichi port by sea to his castle at [[Edo]]. Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Yokkaichi was ''[[tenryō]]'' territory controlled directly by the ''[[shōgun]]'' and administered by a ''[[daikan]]'' based at the [[jin'ya|Yokkaichi Jin'ya]]. Throughout the [[Edo period]], the area prospered as [[Yokkaichi-juku]], the forty-third station on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. However, the city was largely destroyed by the [[Ansei great earthquakes]].

Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], Yokkaichi Town was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, and was designated the capital of Mie Prefecture. Yokkaichi's port advanced remarkably during the [[Meiji period]], primarily under the guidance of Inaba Sanuemon, a resident merchant interested in increasing trade in the Yokkaichi and Ise area by modernizing the port facilities. Starting in 1872, the project took 12 years to complete due to typhoons and difficulties in financing the project. This led to the port city being designated an Official International Port in 1899<ref>US Department of State. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKCOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA759&dq=  ''A digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties and other international agreements'' (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759].</ref> The primary trade items shipped through Yokkaichi were originally seed oil, [[Banko ware]], and Ise tea; but now it has developed into a port that handles cotton, wool, glass, and heavy equipment. Yokkaichi was elevated to city status on August 1, 1897.

From 1939, Yokkaichi became a center for the chemical industry, with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] constructing a large refinery near the port area. Yokkaichi was one of the first cities bombed by the United States during [[World War II]], when on April 18, 1942, the city was attacked by aircraft from the [[Doolittle Raid]]. During the final stages of World War II, on June 18, 1945, 89 [[B-29 Superfortress]] bombers dropped 11,000 incendiary bombs destroying 35% of the urban area and killing 736 people. This [[Bombing of Yokkaichi in World War II|attack on Yokkaichi]] was followed by another eight air raids until August 8, 1945, killing another 808 people.

From 1960 to 1972, the city residents suffered health problems caused by the emission of [[Sulfur oxide|SOx]] into the atmosphere from local petrochemical and chemical plants. In Japan, a disease called ''Yokkaichi zensoku'' ([[Yokkaichi asthma]]) derives its name from the city, and it is considered one of the [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan]].

[[File:四日市ふれあいモール.jpg|thumb|Downtown Yokkaichi]]
Yokkaichi attained [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] status on November 1, 2000, with increased local autonomy.

On February 7, 2005, the town of [[Kusu, Mie|Kusu]] (from [[Mie District, Mie|Mie District]]) was merged into Yokkaichi.

==Government==
Yokkaichi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 34 members. Yokkaichi contributes seven members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between Mie 2nd district and Mie 3rd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Yokkaichi is a manufacturing center that produces [[Banko ware]] (a kind of [[earthenware]] and [[stoneware]]),<ref>{{cite web |title=Japanese Banko ware Identification & Marks |url=https://www.bluecherryantiques.co.uk/pages/japanese-banko-ware-identification-marks |website=Blue Cherry Antiques |access-date=19 October 2021}}</ref> [[automobiles]], cotton [[textiles]], [[chemicals]], [[tea]], [[cement]], and computer parts such as [[flash memory]] by [[Kioxia]] and [[Western Digital]].
