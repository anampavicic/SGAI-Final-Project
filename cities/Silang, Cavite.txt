'''Silang''' ({{IPA|tl|ˈsi.lɐŋ|lang}}), officially the '''Municipality of Silang''' ({{lang-fil|Bayan ng Silang}}), is a 1st class highly urbanized [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 295,644 people.{{PH census|current}}

Silang is located in the eastern section of Cavite. It is home to the [[Philippine National Police Academy]], [[Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency#PDEA Academy|PDEA Academy]], and [[International Institute of Rural Reconstruction]] head office.

With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], the municipality is now part of the Manila's conurbation which spans southward toward [[Lipa, Batangas]].

==Etymology==
The name of Silang (originally called ''Silan'') originates from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ''[[wikt:silang|silang]]'', meaning "mountain pass".<ref name="Lesho">{{cite book |last1=Lesho |first1=Marivic |last2=Sippola |first2=Eeva |title=Vergleichende Kolonialtoponomastik Strukturen und Funktionen kolonialer Ortsbenennung |date=2018 |publisher=De Gruyter |chapter=Toponyms in Manila and Cavite, Philippines |isbn=9783110608618 |pages=317–332}}</ref>

==History==

===Pre-Hispanic period===
The traditional origins of the town are attributed to ten [[Borneo|Bornean]] [[datu]]s who sailed northward on board [[balangay]]s and ended in Silang through [[Taal Lake]]. Its first settlers were Gat Hingiw, his wife Gat Kaliwanag, and their seven children, who later moved to different parts of the town and established their respective barangays. Gat Pandan stayed in the original community and developed the area.<ref name=Silan>[http://museodesilan.wordpress.com/early-history-silang/ "History of Silang"]. Museo de Silan. Retrieved on June 18, 2013.</ref>

===Spanish colonial era===
During the start of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, tracts of land were given by the [[King of Spain]] to the [[conquistador]]es and their descendants, who collected [[tribute]]s from the people residing in their acquired lands. Silang originally belonged to the ''encomienda'' ([[land grant]]) of Diego Jorge de Villalobos; his claim extended to what is today the towns of Carmona, Amadeo, Indang, Alfonso, General Trias, and Tanza.<ref name=Silan/> On February 3, 1595, the parish of Silang was established, formally creating the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1061362| title= Silang Church: A national cultural treasure in Cavite|first=Gladys|last=Pino|publisher=Philippine News Agency|date=February 9, 2019|accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> For many years, Silang was one of the biggest towns, by the 20th century its land area was reduced to its current size, as some of its former villages later became independent towns. [[Indang]] was the first to be granted town status in 1655. By the 19th century, the town lost land to the towns of [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]] and [[Amadeo, Cavite|Amadeo]], and by 1938, the town's southern lands were ceded to become part of the city of [[Tagaytay]].

The Silang encomienda was later purchased from King [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]] for 2,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] on March 9, 1746, to prevent it from becoming a "friar land" like the other towns of Cavite, executed through the representation of Bernabe Javier Manahan and Gervacio dela Cruz.<ref name=Silan/>

===Contemporary history===
On January 22, 2023, the municipality was certified by [[Guinness World Records]] as volunteers from the municipal government and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Our Lady of Candelaria Parish Church (Silang)|parish church]] successfully lit 621 candles in a world record attempt for longest line of candles lit in relay, surpassing 366 set in [[India]] in 2016. The attempt was held to commemorate the feast of ''[[Our Lady of Candelaria|Nuestra Señora de Candelaria]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Abrina |first=Dennis |date=January 24, 2023 |title=Silang sets new world record for candle relay |url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/01/24/news/regions/silang-sets-new-world-record-for-candle-relay/1875536/ |work=[[The Manila Times]] |access-date=January 25, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Deña |first=Carla |date=January 23, 2023 |title=Silang, Cavite breaks Guinness World Record for longest line of candles lit in relay |url=https://mb.com.ph/2023/01/23/silang-cavite-breaks-guinness-world-record-for-longest-line-of-candles-lit-in-relay/ |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |access-date=January 25, 2023}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
{{Hatnote|Average temperatures vary greatly due to variations in elevation across the municipality.}}
Silang has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with a pronounced dry season from November to April. Its nearness to Tagaytay is the reason for its near-winter like cold temperatures during the early dry season, especially in the villages straddling the Tagaytay border and the town proper.

== Economy ==
{{PH poverty incidence}}
[[File:7009Silang, Cavite Landmarks Barangays 05.jpg|thumb|Pineapple plantation in Silang]]
Silang, like most of the towns in the province of Cavite, depends on a mainly agricultural economy. The primary crops grown in the area are coconut, coffee, corn, banana, pineapple, and tree crops like mango, lanzones, caimito, santol, jackfruit, guava, and avocado. Fertile soils and abundant water sources make Silang suitable not only for common commercial crops but also for high value and exotic crops production. Most of the local farmers practice intercropping to increase land productivity and lessen soil erosion. Fruit production exceeds the demand of the municipality's population, thus, supply excesses are marketed to Metro Manila and neighboring urban centers. A number of poultry and swine farms are also located in some rural barangays.

<!-- [[File:259Barangays Silang Cavite Landmarks 42.jpg|thumb|Microtel by Wyndham South Forbes]] -->
Manufacturing and trade are Silang's other major sources of income. Trade and investments grew tremendously with the influx of both Manila-based and foreign investors. Total investments were estimated at {{Philippine peso|2.5 billion|link=yes}} between 1996 and 2004, which helped bring about the employment of 3,000 people. Despite the slowdown of progress in 2004, Land Value still soared, allowing investors to infiltrate and start business. The investment trend resulted in the increase in the price of prime realty from {{Philippine peso|3,000}} to {{Philippine peso|15,000}} per square meter and from {{Philippine peso|150}} to {{Philippine peso|500}} per square meter for raw lots in interior barangays. Trade establishments in Silang include gasoline stations, convenience stores, restaurants, lumber/hardware traders, shopping malls, groceries, resorts, and hotels.

The dry goods section of the Silang Public Market can now accommodate 228 stalls.

Silang houses the Maguyam Industrial Complex and the Daichi Industrial Complex, in addition to a total of ten factories operating outside the export processing zone.

Silang can be reached by bus or by jeepney. Coming from Manila, it would take around 2 hours to reach the town proper. Silang is accessible by land transportation. Major road networks to and from Laguna and [[Batangas]] traverse it making the town a potential trading center for agricultural products while enjoying an environment that is free of traffic and pollution problems. Commuters are assured of smooth travel within the borders of the municipality with of its good road networks of approximately {{cvt|187.83|km}}. Major roads include [[Aguinaldo Highway]], [[Santa Rosa–Tagaytay Road]], [[Governor's Drive]] (along the municipal boundary with [[General Mariano Alvarez]]), and [[Cavite–Laguna Expressway]]. Six major road projects were completed in 1996, being the Bulihan Resettlement Area Road, the {{cvt|8|km|abbr=on}} Kaong-Maguyam Road, the Caramanzana Drive connecting the Silang Public Market with Aguinaldo Highway, the {{cvt|2|km|abbr=on}} Sabutan-Iba Road, the DPWH funded [[Santa Rosa-Tagaytay Road|Santa Rosa-Silang-Tagaytay Road]], and the Malabag Road. The proposed [[Cavite–Tagaytay–Batangas Expressway]] will have its eastern end built in Silang.
