In 1985, the international [[Adopt-a-Highway]] movement began in Tyler. After appeals from local [[Texas Department of Transportation]] officials, the local [[Civitan International]] chapter adopted a two-mile (three kilometer) stretch of [[U.S. Route 69 in Texas|U.S. Route 69]] to maintain. Drivers and other motorists traveling on this segment of U.S. 69 (between Tyler and nearby [[Lindale, Texas|Lindale]]) will see brown road signs that read "First Adopt-A-Highway in the World".

As Northeast Texas and Smith County's major economic, educational, financial, medical and cultural hub, Tyler is host to more than 20,000 [[Higher education|higher-education]] students; the [[University of Texas at Tyler]]; a university health science center; and regional hospital systems. It is the headquarters for [[Brookshire Grocery Company]] and many other large employers. Tyler is also home to the [[Caldwell Zoo]] and [[Broadway Square Mall]], and the seat of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tyler]] and its [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Tyler, Texas)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Tyler, Texas}}
Legal recognition of Tyler was initiated by an act of the [[Texas Legislature|state legislature]] on April 11, 1846. The Texas government created Smith County and authorized a county seat.

The first plat designated a 28-block town site centered by a main square within a {{cvt|100|acre|ha sqmi|adj=on}} tract acquired by Smith County on 6 February 1847. The new town was named for [[John Tyler|President John Tyler]], who advocated for the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States. A log building on the square's north side served as a courthouse and public meeting hall until a brick courthouse displaced it in {{year|1852}}. The City of Tyler was incorporated on January 29, 1850. Early religious and social institutions included the First Baptist Church and a [[Marvin Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist church]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://marvin.church/who-we-are/our-history/ | title=Our History | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201045909/https://marvin.church/who-we-are/our-history/ | archive-date=2023-02-01}}</ref> a [[Masonic lodge]] and an [[Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows lodge]], and Tyler's first newspaper.<ref name="hto">{{cite web |series=Handbook of Texas Online |first=Christopher |last=Long |title=TYLER, TX |access-date=November 3, 2018 |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdt04 |date=June 15, 2010 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref>

Though Tyler's early economy from {{year|1847}}–{{year|1873}} was based on agriculture, it was also well-diversified during this period. Logging was a second major industry, while complementary manufacturing included metalworking, milling wood, and leather tanning. As the seat of Smith County, the town also benefited from government activity.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Form: People's National Bank Building |access-date=November 3, 2018 |page=7 |series=Texas Historic Sites Atlas |url=https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/NR/pdfs/02000896/02000896.pdf |last=Williams |first=Diane Elizabeth |date=June 20, 2001}}</ref> The local agricultural economy relied on [[Slavery in the United States|slave labor]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1860, the population of enslaved people in Smith County was 4,982, the 4th most in east Texas.<ref>{{Cite web |year=1860 |title=Population of the United States in 1860: Texas |url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1860/population/1860a-34.pdf |access-date=October 10, 2022 |website=Census.gov |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=October 17, 2021 |title=How farmland, timber and oil changed the face of East Texas forever |url=https://thetylerloop.com/how-farmland-timber-and-oil-changed-the-face-of-east-texas-forever/ |access-date=November 10, 2022 |website=thetylerloop.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

By 1860, Tyler held over 1,000 enslaved persons, which represented 35 percent of the town's population. There was strong support for [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] within Tyler, as a high percentage of its residents voted for secession and many of its men joined the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]]. The town was secure enough for the Confederate States of America to establish the largest ordinance plant in [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]]. In 1870, Bonner and Williams established Tyler's first bank. When both the [[Texas and Pacific Railroad]] and the International Railroad (Texas) originally eschewed routes through Tyler, townspeople financed the [[Texas and St. Louis Railway#Tyler Tap Railroad|Tyler Tap Railroad]] to link the town to the national rail grid.<ref name=Tyler>{{cite web|url= https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/tyler-tx |title=Tyler, TX|publisher=Texas State Historical Society|accessdate=October 8, 2023}}</ref><ref name=Museum/>  Ironically, before that 21-mile line to [[Big Sandy, Texas]] was completed in 1877, Tyler had already gotten its desired rail connection when the [[International–Great Northern Railroad]]  built into town in 1874.<ref name=Tyler/><ref name=Rails>{{cite web|url= https://www.american-rails.com/cotton.html |title=St. Louis Southwestern Railway, "The Cotton Belt Route"|publisher=American-Rails, June 12, 2023|accessdate=October 8, 2023}}</ref><ref name=TSL>{{cite web|url= https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/texas-and-st-louis-railway|title=Texas and St. Louis Railway|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=October 8, 2023}}</ref>  Regardless, the Tyler Tap became the seed for the 725-mile-long [[Texas and St. Louis Railway]], which in turn formed the core of the later [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company|St. Louis Southwestern Railway]], commonly known as the Cotton Belt.<ref name=Rails/><ref name=TSL/><ref name=Museum>{{cite web|url= https://arkansasrailroadmuseum.org/about/cotton-belt-route.html |title=St. Louis Southwestern Railroad History|publisher=Arkansas Railroad Museum|accessdate=October 5, 2023}}</ref>

Toward the end of the nineteenth century, fruit orchards emerged as an important business in the regional economy. Eighty percent of the county's agricultural revenue derived from cotton as it persisted as the dominant crop in the first decades of the [[20th century in the United States|twentieth century]]. Peaches were the principal fruit crop as the county fruit tree inventory surpassed one million by 1900. Disease struck the peach trees, though, and local farmers moved toward growing roses by the 1920s. Twenty years later, most of the U.S. rose supply originated in the Tyler area.<ref name="hto" />

On October 29, 1895, an African American suspect named Robert Henry Hillard was burned at the stake in the Smith County Courthouse Square for the alleged murder of a nineteen-year-old white woman.<ref>''Galveston Daily News''.

Later, two entrepreneurs combined photographs from the actual lynching with others staged with actors and sold the 16-image production as a stereographic set. One of the original sets sits in the [[Library of Congress|United States Library of Congress]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
