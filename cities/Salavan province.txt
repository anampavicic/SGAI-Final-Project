==History==
Approximately 1,500 years ago, [[Khmer people]] established settlements in what is now Salavan province. It came to be ruled by the [[Champa]] after the [[Cham people]] migrated from [[South Central China|South China]] to the territory. Various kingdoms united into the [[Lan Xang]] under [[Fa Ngum]] in 1353. Between 1779 and 1893, the province was a Thai colony. In the 20th century, it became a French Protectorate under the Franco-Siamese Treaty of October 3, 1893. The province had 8 districts and 715 villages after the liberation of 1975.<ref name="VFI">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:zIN52MQA_UEJ:www.villagefocus.org/Anti-trafficking/Chasing%2520Horizons%2520FINAL%2520color.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiHpd2qFkjoXTRJMHNjpJp4PvGfmfX3jm8Rhx9dvYsSpyFXQYkNtGz7d4bVlDX3d7ncNvXQsWrD8iByv5bPFu0M3Ypqjb5yYBDrvR5G6g8c2dt7Q08CHKDHkbGSyquGHuRmJb3v&sig=AHIEtbQhqlm-p174gN8ax8JrzGbrE2qx9A|title=‘CHASING HORIZONS’: A STUDY INTO CROSS BORDER MIGRATION AND TRAFFICKING1 IN SEVEN VILLAGES OF LAKHONEPHENG DISTRICT SALAVAN PROVINCE, LAO PDR|last=THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR AND SOCIAL WELFARE|publisher=Village Focus International|pages=5|access-date=6 December 2012}}</ref>
