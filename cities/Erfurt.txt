The city is on the [[Via Regia]], a medieval trade and pilgrims' road network. Modern Erfurt is also a hub for [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] high speed trains and other German and European transport networks. Erfurt was first mentioned in 742, as [[Saint Boniface]] founded the diocese. Although the town did not belong to any of the Thuringian states politically, it quickly became the economic centre of the region and was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref>Westholm, Gun (1994) ''Hanseatic Sites, Routes and Monuments: A Traveler's Guide to the Past and Present'', Uppsala: Gotland Centre for Baltic Studies</ref> It was part of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] during the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1802.

=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
To the west of Erfurt in Frienstedt existed, in the AD era, a big [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] village, which was found during the construction of a highway. Where they also discovered the oldest Germanic word ever discovered in Central Germany written in [[Runes|runic script]] was found on a comb from a sacrificial shaft the word: "kaba". From [[Ancient Rome|Roman Times]], however, they found 200 coins dating back to the third century, plus 150 Roman ceramic fragments and more than 200 [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]]. Also 11 inhumation graves of the Haßleben-Leuna group, which is an archeological cultural group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schmidt |first1=Christoph |title=Der mitteldeutsche Fundplatz Frienstedt |url=https://zbsa.eu/der-mitteldeutsche-fundplatz-frienstedt/ |website=Zentrum für Baltische und Skandinavische Archäologie (ZBSA) — Zentrum für Baltische und Skandinavische Archäologie |access-date=9 May 2024 |language=de-DE |date=10 June 2021}}</ref>

The town is first mentioned in 742 under the name of "Erphesfurt": in that year, [[Saint Boniface]] wrote to [[Pope Zachary]] to inform him that he had established three [[diocese]]s in central Germany, one of them "in a place called Erphesfurt, which for a long time has been inhabited by pagan natives." All three dioceses (the other two were [[Würzburg]] and [[Büraburg]]) were confirmed by Zachary the next year, though in 755 Erfurt was brought into the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|diocese of Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Heinemeyer |first=Karl |title=Bonifatius: Heidenopfer, Christuskreuz, Eichenkult |year=2004 |publisher=Stadtverwaltung Erfurt |pages=73–87 |editor=Hardy Eidam |editor2=Marina Moritz |editor3=Gerd-Rainer Riedel |editor4=Kai-Uwe Schierz |language=de |chapter=Bonifatius in Mitteldeutschland}}</ref> That the place was populous already is borne out by archeological evidence, which includes 23 graves and six horse burials from the sixth and seventh centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schmidt |first=Christoph G. |title=Bonifatius: Heidenopfer, Christuskreuz, Eichenkult |year=2004 |publisher=Stadtverwaltung Erfurt |pages=39–56 |editor=Hardy Eidam |editor2=Marina Moritz |editor3=Gerd-Rainer Riedel |editor4=Kai-Uwe Schierz |language=de |chapter=Im Machtbereich der Merowinger: Politische und gesellschaftliche Strukturen in Thüringen vom 6. bis 8.

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], Erfurt was an important trading town because of its location, near a [[ford (river)|ford]] across the Gera river. Together with the other five Thuringian [[woad]] towns of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], [[Bad Tennstedt|Tennstedt]], [[Arnstadt]] and [[Bad Langensalza|Langensalza]] it was the centre of the German woad trade, which made those cities very wealthy. Erfurt was the junction of important trade routes: the [[Via Regia]] was one of the most used east–west roads between France and Russia (via [[Frankfurt]], Erfurt, [[Leipzig]] and [[Wrocław]]) and another route in the north–south direction was the connection between the [[Baltic Sea]] ports (e. g. [[Lübeck]]) and the potent upper Italian city-states like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Milan]].

During the tenth and eleventh centuries both the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and the [[Electorate of Mainz]] held some privileges in Erfurt. The German kings had an important monastery on Petersberg hill and the Archbishops of Mainz collected taxes from the people. Around 1100, some people became free citizens by paying the annual "{{lang|de|Freizins}}" (liberation tax), which marks a first step in becoming an independent city. During the 12th century, as a sign of more and more independence, the citizens built a city wall around Erfurt (in the area of today's {{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}}). After 1200, independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in 1217; the town hall was built in 1275. In the following decades, the council bought a city-owned territory around Erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly 100 villages and castles and even another small town ([[Sömmerda]]). Erfurt became an important regional power between the [[Landgraviate of Thuringia]] around, the Electorate of Mainz to the west and the [[Electorate of Saxony]] to the east. Between 1306 and 1481, Erfurt was allied with the two other major Thuringian cities ([[Mühlhausen]] and [[Nordhausen, Thuringia|Nordhausen]]) in the Thuringian City Alliance and the three cities joined the [[Hanseatic League]] together in 1430. A peak in economic development was reached in the 15th century, when the city had a population of 20,000 making it one of the largest in Germany. Between 1432 and 1446, a second and higher city wall was established. In 1483, a first city fortress was built on Cyriaksburg hill in the southwestern part of the town.

In the year 1184, Erfurt was the location of a notable accident called the ''[[Erfurter Latrinensturz]]'' ('Erfurt latrine fall'). King [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] held council in a building of the [[Erfurt Cathedral]] to negotiate peace between two of his vassals, Archbishop Konrad I of Mainz and Landgrave Ludwig III of [[Thuringia]]. The amassed weight of all the gathered men proved too heavy for the floor to bear, which collapsed. According to contemporary accounts, dozens of people fell to their death into the [[latrine]] pit below. Ludwig III, Konrad I and Henry VI survived the affair.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.genealogie-mittelalter.de/ludowinger_landgrafen_von_thueringen/chronik_zu_erfurt.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004181057/http://www.genealogie-mittelalter.de/ludowinger_landgrafen_von_thueringen/chronik_zu_erfurt.html |url-status=dead |title=Chronicle of Erfurt |website=Web Archive |archive-date=2010-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefortweekly.com/issues/issue-1/curio-1-the-erfurter-latrinensturz/ |title=Curio #1: The Erfurter Latrinensturz – The Fortweekly |language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-04 |archive-date=3 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903042810/http://www.thefortweekly.com/issues/issue-1/curio-1-the-erfurter-latrinensturz/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Jewish community of Erfurt was founded in the 11th century and became, together with [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], one of the most influential in Germany. The [[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]] is still extant and is a museum today, as is the [[mikveh]] at Gera river near {{lang|de|Krämerbrücke}}.<ref name="mikveh">Archeologists Discover Medieval Jewish Bath in Erfurt, 12.04.2007, Deutsche Welle, [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2440473,00.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713002201/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2440473,00.html|date=13 July 2007}}</ref> In 1349, during the wave of [[Black Death Jewish persecutions]] across Europe, the Jews of Erfurt were rounded up, with [[Erfurt massacre (1349)|more than 100 killed]] and the rest driven from the city.

In 1501 [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) moved to Erfurt and began his studies at the university. After 1505, he lived at [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St. Augustine's Monastery]] as a friar. In 1507 he was ordained as a priest in Erfurt Cathedral. He moved permanently to [[Wittenberg]] in 1511. Erfurt was an early adopter of the [[Protestant Reformation]], in 1521.<ref>Metaxas, Eric (2017) ''Martin Luther: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World'', New York: Viking Press.</ref>

In 1530, the city became one of the first in Europe to be officially bi-confessional with the [[Hammelburg]] Treaty. It kept that status through all the following centuries. The later 16th and the 17th century brought a slow economic decline of Erfurt. Trade shrank, the population was falling and the university lost its influence. The city's independence was endangered. In 1664, the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] and the city lost its independence. The Electorate built a huge fortress on Petersberg hill between 1665 and 1726 to control the city and instituted a governor to rule Erfurt.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]], many Germans desired to have a united national state. An attempt in this direction was the failed [[Erfurt Union]] of German states in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Erfurt Union Parliament {{!}} German Confederation, Reforms, Nationalism {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Erfurt-Union-Parliament |access-date=2024-05-12 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] reached Erfurt in the 1840s, when the [[Thuringian Railway]] connecting [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt]] was built. During the following years, many factories in different sectors were founded. One of the biggest was the "Royal Gun Factory of [[Prussia]]" in 1862. After the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871, Erfurt moved from the southern border of Prussia to the centre of Germany, so the fortifications of the city were no longer needed. The demolition of the city fortifications in 1873 led to a construction boom in Erfurt, because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond. Many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure (such as a tramway, hospitals, and schools) improved rapidly. The number of inhabitants grew from 40,000 around 1870 to 130,000 in 1914, and the city expanded in all directions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The "[[Erfurt Program]]" was adopted by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] during its congress at Erfurt in 1891.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Internet History Sourcebooks: Modern History |url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1891erfurt.asp |access-date=2023-10-24 |website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu |archive-date=2 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231202135744/https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1891erfurt.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between the wars, the city kept growing. Housing shortages were fought with building programmes and social infrastructure was broadened according to the welfare policy in the [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Great Depression]] between 1929 and 1932 led to a disaster for Erfurt, nearly one out of three became unemployed. Conflicts between far-left and far-right-oriented milieus increased and many inhabitants supported the new Nazi government and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Others, especially some communist workers, put up resistance against the new administration. In 1938, the new synagogue was destroyed during the {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}}. Jews lost their property and emigrated or were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]] (together with many communists). In 1914, the company ''[[Topf and Sons]]'' began the manufacture of crematoria later becoming the market leader in this industry. Under the Nazis, ''JA Topf & Sons'' supplied specially developed crematoria, ovens and associated plants to the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Buchenwald]] and [[Mauthausen-Gusen]] concentration camps. On 27 January 2011 a memorial and museum dedicated to the Holocaust victims was opened at the former company premises in Erfurt.<ref>Schüle, Annegret (2017) ''J.A Topf & Söhne: ein Erfurter Familieunternehmen und der Holocaust''.

During [[World War II]], Erfurt experienced more than 27 British and American air raids, about 1600 civilians died. Bombed as a target of the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]], Erfurt suffered only limited damage and was captured on 12 April 1945, by the US [[80th Infantry Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]].<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 150</ref> On 3 July, American troops left the city, which then became part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Soviet Zone of Occupation]] and eventually of the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]). In 1948, Erfurt became the capital of [[Thuringia]], replacing [[Weimar]]. In 1952, the {{lang|de|[[States of Germany|Länder]]}} in the GDR were dissolved in favour of centralization under the new socialist government. Erfurt then became the capital of a new "{{lang|de|[[Erfurt (Bezirk)|Bezirk]]}}" (district). In 1953, the {{lang|de|[[Hochschule]]}} of education was founded, followed by the {{lang|de|Hochschule}} of medicine in 1954, the first academic institutions in Erfurt since the closing of the university in 1816.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

On 19 March 1970, the East and West German heads of government [[Willi Stoph]] and [[Willy Brandt]] met in Erfurt, the first such meeting since the division of Germany. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the economic situation in GDR worsened, many old buildings in city centre decayed, while the government fought against the housing shortage by building large {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} settlements in the periphery. The [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989/1990 led to [[German reunification]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
[[File:DDR Street signs.jpg|thumb|Socialist-era street signs removed from around the city of Erfurt after 1990]]

With the re-formation of the state of [[Thuringia]] in 1990, the city became the state capital. After reunification, a deep economic crisis occurred in Eastern Germany. Many factories closed and many people lost their jobs and moved to the former West Germany. At the same time, many buildings were redeveloped and the infrastructure improved massively. In 1994, the new university was opened, as was the Fachhochschule in 1991. Between 2005 and 2008, the economic situation improved as the unemployment rate decreased and new enterprises developed. In addition, the population began to increase once again.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

== Geography ==
[[File:Erfurt.Gera Fluss.jpg|thumb|Gera river in the city centre]]

=== Topography ===
Erfurt is situated in the south of the [[Thuringian basin]], a fertile agricultural area between the [[Harz]] mountains {{cvt|80|km|0}} to the north and the [[Thuringian Forest]] {{cvt|30|km|0}} to the southwest. Whereas the northern parts of the city area are flat, the southern ones consist of hilly landscape up to 430 m of elevation. In this part lies the municipal forest of ''{{lang|de|Steigerwald}}'' with [[Fagus sylvatica|beeches]] and [[Quercus robur|oaks]] as main tree species. To the east and to the west are some non-forested hills so that the [[Gera (river)|Gera]] river valley within the town forms a basin. North of the city are some [[gravel pit]]s in operation, while others are abandoned, flooded and used as leisure areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:Erfurt-Ortsteile.png|thumb|Districts of Erfurt]]
Erfurt abuts the districts of [[Sömmerda (district)|Sömmerda]] (municipalities [[Witterda]], [[Elxleben]], [[Walschleben]], [[Riethnordhausen, Thuringia|Riethnordhausen]], [[Nöda]], [[Alperstedt]], [[Großrudestedt]], [[Udestedt]], [[Kleinmölsen]] and [[Großmölsen]]) in the north, [[Weimarer Land]] (municipalities [[Niederzimmern]], [[Nohra]], [[Mönchenholzhausen]] and [[Klettbach]]) in the east, [[Ilm-Kreis]] (municipalities [[Kirchheim, Thuringia|Kirchheim]], [[Rockhausen]] and [[Amt Wachsenburg]]) in the south and [[Gotha (district)|Gotha]] (municipalities [[Nesse-Apfelstädt]], [[Nottleben]], [[Zimmernsupra]] and [[Bienstädt]]) in the west.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The city itself is divided into 53 districts. The centre is formed by the district ''{{lang|de|Altstadt}}'' (old town) and the {{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} districts ''{{lang|de|Andreasvorstadt}}'' in the northwest, ''{{lang|de|Johannesvorstadt}}'' in the northeast, ''{{lang|de|Krämpfervorstadt}}'' in the east, ''{{lang|de|Daberstedt}}'' in the southeast, ''{{lang|de|Löbervorstadt}}'' in the southwest and ''{{lang|de|Brühlervorstadt}}'' in the west. More former industrial districts are ''{{lang|de|Ilversgehofen}}'' (incorporated in 1911), ''{{lang|de|Hohenwinden}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Sulzer Siedlung}}'' in the north. Another group of districts is marked by [[Plattenbau]] settlements, constructed during the [[East Germany]] period: ''{{lang|de|Berliner Platz}}'', ''{{lang|de|Moskauer Platz}}'', ''{{lang|de|Rieth}}'', ''{{lang|de|Roter Berg}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Johannesplatz}}'' in the northern as well as ''{{lang|de|Melchendorf}}'', ''{{lang|de|Wiesenhügel}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Herrenberg}}'' in the southern city parts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Eventually, there are many villages with an average population of approximately 1,000 which were incorporated during the 20th century; they have mostly retained a rural character to date, however:{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

==== Erfurt-Southeast ====
[[File:Herrenberg.JPG|thumb|Herrenberg Street in Erfurt-Southeast]]
Erfurt-Southeast ({{langx|de|Erfurt-Südost|link=no}}) is the collective name for a series of prefabricated housing areas that emerged in the southeast of Erfurt in the last ten years of East Germany.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}} After Erfurt-Nord, Erfurt-Südost is the second-largest prefabricated building area in the city. The problems associated with large housing estates are not as pronounced in the southeast as in the north, but they are still present.

The districts of Melchendorf, Herrenberg and Wiesenhügel belong to Erfurt-Südost, all of which were formed from the former local area of Melchendorf. The village of Melchendorf with around 1,000 inhabitants lies between the prefabricated building areas. In addition to the old village, the district of Melchendorf also includes the prefab housing areas of Drosselberg and Buchenberg as well as several four-story apartment blocks from the 1950s and 1960s on {{lang|de|Kranichfelder Straße}}. Around 24,000 people still live in the large settlement, which was once designed for almost 40,000 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Around the year 1500, the city had 18,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The population then more or less stagnated until the 19th&nbsp;century. The population of Erfurt was 21,000 in 1820, and increased to 32,000 in 1847, the year of rail connection as industrialization began. In the following decades Erfurt grew up to 130,000 at the beginning of World War&nbsp;I and 190,000 inhabitants in 1950. A maximum was reached in 1988 with 220,000 persons. In 1991, after the [[German reunification]] and when Erfurt became the capital of [[Thuringia]] state, it had a population of about 205,000. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 200,000 in 2002 before rising again to 206,000 in 2011. The average growth of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.68 % p.&nbsp;a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Erfurt. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. Erfurt is also the 10th-largest city in Germany by area with area of {{cvt|269.17|km2|sqmi}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The birth deficit was 200 in 2012, this is −1.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: −4.5; national average: −2.4). The net migration rate was +8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: −0.8; national average: +4.6).<ref>According to {{lang|de|[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]}}</ref> The most important regions of origin of Erfurt migrants are rural areas of Thuringia, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]] as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Syria, Afghanistan and Hungary. Erfurt is today one of the popular cities in former [[East Germany]] due to its universities and broadcasting companies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}<ref>{{Cite news |title=Erfurt in Thüringen.

Like other cities within the area of former East Germany, foreigners account only for a small share of Erfurt's population: {{circa}}&nbsp;3.0 % are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.9 % are migrants (according to the [[2011 European Union census]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Due to the official atheism of the former [[Communism|communist]] East German regime, most of the population is non-religious. 14.8 % are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 6.8 % are [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (according to the 2011 EU census). The Jewish community consists of 500 members. Most of them migrated to Erfurt from Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

=== Theatre ===
Since 2003, the modern opera house is home to [[Theater Erfurt]] and its Philharmonic Orchestra. The "grand stage" section has 800 seats and the "studio stage" can hold 200 spectators. In September 2005, the opera ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians (opera)|Waiting for the Barbarians]]'' by [[Philip Glass]] premiered in the opera house. The Erfurt Theatre has been a source of controversy. In 2005, a performance of [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s opera ''{{lang|de|[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]}}'' stirred up the local press since the performance contained suggestions of pedophilia and incest.

On 12 April 2008, a version of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''{{lang|it|[[Un ballo in maschera]]}}'' directed by Johann Kresnik opened at the Erfurt Theatre. The production stirred deep controversy by featuring nude performers in [[Mickey Mouse]] masks dancing on the ruins of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and a female singer with a painted on [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] toothbrush moustache performing a straight arm [[Nazism|Nazi]] salute, along with sinister portrayals of American soldiers, [[Uncle Sam]], and [[Elvis Presley]] impersonators. The director described the production as a populist critique of modern American society, aimed at showing up the disparities between rich and poor. The controversy prompted one local politician to call for locals to boycott the performances, but this was largely ignored and the première was sold out.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/11/wopera111.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413002501/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/11/wopera111.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 April 2008 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |title=German staging of Verdi's ''A Masked Ball'' on 9/11 with naked cast in Mickey Mouse masks |date=11 April 2008 |access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref>

Notable types of sport in Erfurt are athletics, ice skating, cycling (with the oldest velodrome in use in the world, opened in 1885), swimming, handball, volleyball, tennis and football. The city's football club {{lang|de|[[FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt]]}} is member of {{lang|de|[[3. Fußball-Liga]]}} and based in {{lang|de|[[Steigerwaldstadion]]}} with a capacity of 20,000.

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Brühlervorstadt.JPG|thumb|Architecture from the ''{{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}}'' in Brühlervorstadt district]]
Erfurt's cityscape features a medieval core of narrow, curved alleys in the centre surrounded by a belt of ''{{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}}'' architecture, created between 1873 and 1914. In 1873, the city's fortifications were demolished and it became possible to build houses in the area in front of the former city walls. In the following years, Erfurt saw a construction boom. In the northern area (districts Andreasvorstadt, Johannesvorstadt and Ilversgehofen) [[tenement]]s for the factory workers were built whilst the eastern area (Krämpfervorstadt and Daberstedt) featured apartments for white-collar workers and clerks and the southwestern part (Löbervorstadt and Brühlervorstadt) with its beautiful valley landscape saw the construction of villas and mansions of rich factory owners and notables.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

During the interwar period, some settlements in [[Bauhaus]] style were realized, often as housing cooperatives.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-03-19 |title=Bauhaus100 – Baudenkmale der Moderne |trans-title=Bauhaus100 – Architectural Monuments of Modernism |url=https://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/erleben/besuch/bauhaus100/baudenkmale/index.html |access-date=2024-10-12 |website=Erfurt.de |language=de}}</ref>

After World War II and over the whole GDR period, housing shortages remained a problem even though the government started a big apartment construction programme. Between 1970 and 1990 large {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} settlements with high-rise blocks on the northern (for 50,000 inhabitants) and southeastern (for 40,000 inhabitants) periphery were constructed. After reunification the renovation of old houses in city centre and the ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}'' areas was a big issue. The federal government granted substantial subsidies, so that many houses could be restored.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Compared to many other German cities, little of Erfurt was destroyed in World War II. This is one reason why the centre today offers a mixture of medieval, Baroque and [[Neoclassical architecture]] as well as buildings from the last 150 years.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Magazine |first1=Smithsonian |last2=Kiniry |first2=Laura |title=Could Erfurt Be Germany's Most Magical Christmas Town? |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/could-erfurt-be-germanys-most-magical-christmas-town-180971095/ |access-date=2024-03-21 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |language=en}}</ref>

As religious freedom was granted in the 19th century, some Jews returned to Erfurt. They built their synagogue on the banks of the Gera river and used it from 1840 until 1884. The neoclassical building is known as the ''Kleine Synagoge'' (Small Synagogue). Today it is used an events centre. It is also open to visitors.<ref name=kleinsyn>[http://juedisches-leben.erfurt.de/jl/en/19-century/small_synagogue/index.html Jewish Life in Erfurt.

A larger synagogue, the ''Große Synagoge'' (Great Synagogue), was opened in 1884 because the community had become larger and wealthier.

The Domplatz is the main setting of the Erfurt Christmas Market in December and the location for "DomStufen-Festival", an open-air theatre festival in summer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* The ''{{lang|de|Fischmarkt}}'' (Fish Market) is the central square of Erfurt's city centre. It is surrounded by renaissance-style patrician houses and the town hall, a neo-gothic building from 1882. In the middle of the square is a statue called ''{{lang|de|Römer}}'' (Roman), a symbol of the city's independence, erected by the citizens in 1591.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* The ''{{lang|de|Wenigemarkt}}'' (Minor Market) is a small square on the east side of the Gera river (opposite to the Fischmarkt on the west side), surrounded by early-modern patrician and merchants' houses. The fountain on this square with the sculpture "Scuffling Boys" was created in 1975. Today, {{lang|de|Wenigemarkt}} square also has various cafés and bars. Next to the {{lang|de|Wenigemarkt}} in {{lang|de|Futterstraße}} is the {{lang|de|Kaisersaal}} building, a neoclassicistic event hall from 1831 (current building). The [[Congress of Erfurt]] took place here in 1808.
* The ''{{lang|de|Anger}}'' (originally the German term for "[[village green]]") is a protracted square{{clarify|date=October 2014}} in the eastern city centre. All tram lines are linked here, so that it became the new city centre during the 20th century with many important buildings. On its northern side is the main post office, built in 1886 in neo-gothic style with its prominent clock tower. In the north-east there is the Martin Luther monument from 1889 in front of the Merchants' Church. Between the church and the Ursuline monastery lies the "Anger 1" department store from 1908. On the south side next to Station Street is the {{lang|de|Angermuseum}}, the art history museum of Erfurt, inside a Baroque palace from 1711. The western part of Anger square is surrounded by large historicist business houses from the late 19th century. The west end of the square is marked by the Angerbrunnen fountain from 1890. The Jesuit College near {{lang|de|Schlösserstraße}} was built in 1737 and used until the ban of the Jesuits in 1773.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* The ''[[Willy Brandt]] Square'' is the southern gate to the city centre in front of the main station. Opposite to the station is the former hotel ''{{lang|de|Erfurter Hof}}'', where the first meeting of the East- and West-German heads of government took place in 1970. On the western side is the building of the old Erfurt station (1847–95) with a clock tower and the former offices of the Thuringian Railway Company.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* The ''{{lang|de|Hirschgarten}}'' (Deer Garden) is a small park in front of the Thuringian government seat in the western city centre. The minister-president's seat is the ''{{lang|de|Kurmainzische Statthalterei}}'', a Renaissance-Baroque palace from the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* The ''{{lang|de|Michaelisstraße}}'' (Michael's Street) is known as "the lithic chronicle of Erfurt", because of its mostly medieval buildings. It is the main street of the Latin quarter around the old university and today one of the favourite nightlife districts of the Erfurters with various bars, restaurants and cafés. The central building of the old university, {{lang|la|Collegium Maius}}, was built in 1515, destroyed by Allied bombs in 1945 and originally rebuilt in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* The ''{{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}}'' is an inner-city circular road following the former inner city wall. The road was set out in the 1890s by closing a branch of the Gera river. The buildings along the street originate from all periods of the 20th century, including some GDR-era highrise residence buildings. An old building complex here is the former Great Hospital, established in the 14th century. Today, it hosts the museum of popular art and cultural anthropology.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* The ''{{lang|de|Andreasviertel}}'' (St Andrew's Quarter) is a small quarter in the northern part of the city centre between {{lang|de|Domplatz}} in the south-west and {{lang|de|Moritzwallstraße}} in the north-east. It was the former craftsmen quarter with narrow alleys and old (16th/17th century) little houses. During the 20th century, there were plans to demolish the quarter because of its bad housing conditions. After 1990, the houses were redeveloped by private individuals so that it is one of the favourite neighbourhoods today. The largest building here is the former Municipal Corn Storage in Gothic style from 1466 with a floor area of {{cvt|1800|m2|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

=====Fortifications=====
[[File:Zitadelle_Erfurt.jpg|thumb|[[Petersberg Citadel]]]]
From 1066 until 1873 the old town of Erfurt was encircled by a fortified wall. About 1168 this was extended to run around the western side of Petersberg hill, enclosing it within the city boundaries.<ref name=walls>Stadtverwaltung Erfurt (4 September 2012). [http://www.erfurt-web.de/Stadtbefestigung ''Stadtbefestigung einst und jetzt''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026171154/http://www.erfurt-web.de/Stadtbefestigung |date=26 October 2021 }}. Retrieved 28 December 2017</ref>

After [[German Unification]] in 1871, Erfurt became part of the newly created [[German Empire]]. The threat to the city from its Saxon neighbours and from Bavaria was no longer present, so it was decided to dismantle the city walls. Only a few remnants remain today. A piece of inner wall can be found in a small park at the corner Juri-Gagarin-Ring and Johannesstraße and another piece at the flood ditch (''Flutgraben'') near Franckestraße. There is also a small restored part of the wall in the Brühler Garten, behind the Catholic orphanage. Only one of the wall's fortified towers was left standing, on Boyneburgufer, but this was destroyed in an air raid in 1944.<ref name=walls />

The [[Petersberg Citadel]] is one of the largest and best preserved city fortresses in Europe, covering an area of 36 hectares in the north-west of the city centre. It was built from 1665 on Petersberg hill and was in military use until 1963. Since 1990, it has been significantly restored and is now open to the public as an historic site.<ref name="350jahre">Verein der Freunde der Citadelle Petersberg zu Erfurt e.V. (2015).

The {{Interlanguage link multi|Cyriaksburg Citadel|de|3=Zitadelle Cyriaksburg}} is a smaller citadel south-west of the city centre, dating from 1480. Today, it houses the German horticulture museum.<ref>[https://www.gartenbaumuseum.de/die-cyriaksburg.html ''Die Cyriaksburg: Sitz des Deutschen Gartenbaumuseums Erfurt''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229232259/https://www.gartenbaumuseum.de/die-cyriaksburg.html |date=29 December 2017 }}.

=====19th- and 20th-century architecture in the outskirts=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
Between 1873 and 1914, a belt of ''{{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}}'' architecture emerged around the city centre. The mansion district in the south-west around {{lang|de|Cyriakstraße}}, {{lang|de|Richard-Breslau-Straße}} and {{lang|de|Hochheimer Straße}} hosts some interesting ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}'' and ''Art Nouveau'' buildings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The "Mühlenviertel" ("mill quarter"), is an area of beautiful Art Nouveau apartment buildings, cobblestone streets and street trees just to the north of the old city, in the vicinity of Nord Park, bordered by the Gera river on its east side. The [[Schmale Gera]] stream runs through the area. In the Middle Ages numerous small enterprises using the power of water mills occupied the area, hence the name "Mühlenviertel", with street names such as Waidmühlenweg (woad, or indigo, mill way), Storchmühlenweg (stork mill way) and Papiermühlenweg (paper mill way).{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The ''[[Bauhaus]]'' style is represented by some housing cooperative projects in the east around {{lang|de|Flensburger Straße}} and {{lang|de|Dortmunder Straße}} and in the north around {{lang|de|Neuendorfstraße}}. Lutherkirke Church in {{lang|de|Magdeburger Allee}} (1927), is an [[Art Deco]] building.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The former malt factory "Wolff" at {{lang|de|Theo-Neubauer-Straße}} in the east of Erfurt is a large industrial complex built between 1880 and 1939, and in use until 2000. A new use has not been found yet, but the area is sometimes used as a location in movie productions because of its atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Examples of Nazi architecture include the buildings of the {{lang|de|Landtag}} (Thuringian parliament) and {{lang|de|Thüringenhalle}} (an event hall) in the south at {{lang|de|Arnstädter Straße}}. While the {{lang|de|Landtag}} building (1930s) represents more the neo-Roman/fascist style, {{lang|de|Thüringenhalle}} (1940s) is marked by some neo-Germanic ''{{lang|de|Heimatschutz}}'' style elements.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The Stalinist early-GDR style is manifested in the main building of the university at {{lang|de|Nordhäuser Straße}} (1953) and the later more international modern GDR style is represented by the horticultural exhibition centre "{{lang|de|Egapark}}" at {{lang|de|Gothaer Straße}}, the {{lang|de|Plattenbau}} housing complexes like Rieth or {{lang|de|Johannesplatz}} and the redevelopment of {{lang|de|Löbertor}} and {{lang|de|Krämpfertor}} area along {{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}} in the city centre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The current international glass and steel architecture is dominant among most larger new buildings like the Federal Labour Court of Germany (1999), the new opera house (2003), the new main station (2007), the university library, the Erfurt Messe (convention centre) and the {{lang|de|[[Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann]]}} ice rink.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}<ref>Source: Official Website of the city of Erfurt - "Architecture in Erfurt" (https://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/service/aktulles/pm/2015/119202.html{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})</ref>

== Economy and infrastructure ==
During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 21% in 2005 to 9% in 2013. Nevertheless, some 14,000 households with 24,500 persons (12% of population) are dependent upon state social benefits ([[Hartz concept|Hartz IV]]).<ref>{{Citation |last=Schindler |first=Martin |title=Chapter 4: What Does the Crisis Tell Us about the German Labor Market? |work=Germany In An Interconnected World Economy |url=https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781616354244/ch004.xml |access-date=2024-04-15 |publisher=International Monetary Fund |language=en |isbn=978-1-61635-424-4}}</ref>

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

[[File:Anger 1 Erfurt Kaufhaus Römischer Kaiser 686-vLh.jpg|thumb|''Anger 1'', a big department store in centre]]

Farming has a great tradition in Erfurt: the cultivation of [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] made the city rich during the Middle Ages. Today, horticulture and the production of flower seeds is still an important business in Erfurt. There is also growing of fruits (like apples, strawberries and sweet cherries), vegetables (e.g. cauliflowers, potatoes, cabbage and sugar beets) and grain on more than 60% of the municipal territory.<ref name=":0" />

Industrialization in Erfurt started around 1850. Until World War I, many factories were founded in different sectors like engine building, shoes, guns, malt and later electro-technics, so that there was no industrial monoculture in the city. After 1945, the companies were nationalized by the [[East Germany|GDR]] government, which led to the decline of some of them. After reunification, nearly all factories were closed, either because they failed to successfully adopt to a free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, in the early 1990s the federal government started to subsidize the foundation of new companies. It still took a long time before the economic situation stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment has decreased and overall, new jobs were created. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Erfurt with electro-technics, semiconductors and photovoltaics in focus. Engine production, food production, the [[Braugold]] brewery, and [[Born Feinkost]], a producer of Thuringian mustard, remain important industries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Erfurt is an ''{{lang|de|Oberzentrum}}'' (which means "supra-centre" according to [[Central place theory]]) in German regional planning. Such centres are always hubs of service businesses and public services like hospitals, universities, research, trade fairs, retail etc. Additionally, Erfurt is the capital of the federal state of Thuringia, so that there are many institutions of administration like all the Thuringian state ministries and some nationwide authorities. Typical for Erfurt are the logistic business with many distribution centres of big companies, the [[Erfurt Trade Fair]] and the media sector with [[KiKa]] and [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] as public broadcast stations. A growing industry is tourism, due to the various historical sights of Erfurt. There are 4,800 hotel beds and (in 2012) 450,000 overnight visitors spent a total of 700,000 nights in hotels. Nevertheless, most tourists are one-day visitors from Germany. The Christmas Market in December attracts some 2,000,000 visitors each year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The official Erfurt Christmas Market Portal |url=https://weihnachtsmarkt.erfurt.de/wm/en/index.html |access-date=2024-05-11 |website=Erfurter Weihnachtsmarkt |language=en}}</ref>

=== Transport ===
[[File:Thuringia Erfurt Hbf asv2020-07 img1.jpg|thumb|[[Erfurt Hauptbahnhof]], Erfurt's main railway station.]]

==== By rail ====
The [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] railway network puts Erfurt 1{{frac|1|2}} hours from [[Berlin]], 2{{frac|1|2}} hours from [[Frankfurt]], 2 hours from [[Dresden]], and 45 minutes from [[Leipzig]]. In 2017, the ICE line to [[Munich]] opened, making the trip to [[Erfurt Hauptbahnhof|Erfurt main station]] only 2{{frac|1|2}} hours.

There are regional trains from Erfurt to [[Weimar]], [[Jena]], [[Gotha]], [[Eisenach]], [[Bad Langensalza]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Nordhausen, Thuringia|Nordhausen]], [[Göttingen]], [[Mühlhausen]], [[Würzburg]], [[Meiningen]], [[Ilmenau]], [[Arnstadt]], and [[Gera]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

In freight transport there is an [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] terminal in the district of Vieselbach ''({{lang|de|Güterverkehrszentrum, GVZ}})'' with connections to rail and the autobahn.<ref>[https://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/wirtschaft/gewerbestandorte/gebiete/108906.html Gewerbegebiet: Güterverkehrszentrum Erfurt (GVZ)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240225223429/https://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/wirtschaft/gewerbestandorte/gebiete/108906.html |date=25 Febrary 2024 }}. Retrieved 25 February 2024</ref>

==== By road ====
The two [[Autobahn]]en crossing each other nearby at ''Erfurter Kreuz'' are the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] ([[Frankfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) and the [[Bundesautobahn 71]] ([[Schweinfurt]]–[[Sangerhausen]]). Together with the east tangent both motorways form a circle road around the city and lead the interregional traffic around the centre. Whereas the A 4 was built in the 1930s, the A 71 came into being after the reunification in the 1990s and 2000s. In addition to both motorways there are two [[Bundesstraße]]n: the [[Bundesstraße 7]] connects Erfurt parallel to A 4 with [[Gotha]] in the west and [[Weimar]] in the east. The [[Bundesstraße 4]] is a connection between Erfurt and [[Nordhausen, Thuringia|Nordhausen]] in the north. Its southern part to [[Coburg]] was annulled when A 71 was finished (in this section, the A 71 now effectively serves as B 4). Within the circle road, B 7 and B 4 are also annulled, so that the city government has to pay for maintenance instead of the German federal government. The access to the city is restricted as ''{{lang|de|[[Low-emission zone|Umweltzone]]}}'' since 2012 for some vehicles. Large parts of the inner city are a pedestrian area which can not be reached by car (except for residents).{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

==== By light rail and bus ====
[[File:Erfurt Straßenbahn Schlösserstr.JPG|thumb|Light rail tram near Anger square]]
The Erfurt public transport system is marked by the area-wide {{lang|de|[[Erfurt Stadtbahn]]}} ([[light rail]]) network, established as a tram system in 1883, upgraded to a light rail (''{{lang|de|Stadtbahn}}'') system in 1997,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stadtwerke-erfurt.de/pb/site/swegruppe/node/140107/Lde/index.html |title=Ausbau der Erfurter Straßenbahn zur Stadtbahn |publisher=Essener Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (EVAG) |language=de |trans-title=Expansion of Erfurt tram to light rail |access-date=2013-10-20 |archive-date=30 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230161952/https://www.stadtwerke-erfurt.de/pb/site/swegruppe/node/140107/Lde/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and continually expanded and upgraded through the 2000s. Today, there are six ''Stadtbahn'' lines running every ten minutes on every light rail route.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Additionally, Erfurt operates a bus system, which connects the sparsely populated outer districts of the region to the city center. Both systems are organized by ''SWE EVAG'', a transit company owned by the city administration. Trolleybuses were in service in Erfurt from 1948 until 1975, but are no longer in service.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

==== By airplane ====
[[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]] lies {{cvt|3|km|0}} west of the city centre. It is linked to the central train station via Stadtbahn (tram). It was significantly extended in the 1990s, with flights mostly to Mediterranean holiday destinations and to London during the peak Christmas market tourist season. Connections to longer haul flights are easily accessible via [[Frankfurt Airport]], which can be reached in 2 hours via a direct train from Frankfurt Airport to Erfurt, and from [[Leipzig Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle Airport]], which can be reached within half an hour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

==== By bike ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
Biking is becoming increasingly popular since construction of high quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. There are cycle lanes for general commuting within Erfurt city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Long-distance trails, such as the ''Gera track'' and the ''{{lang|de|Radweg Thüringer Städtekette}}'' (Thuringian cities trail), connect points of tourist interest. The former runs along the [[Gera (river)|Gera]] river valley from the [[Thuringian Forest]] to the river [[Unstrut]]; the latter follows the medieval [[Via Regia]] from [[Eisenach]] to [[Altenburg]] via [[Gotha]], Erfurt, [[Weimar]], and [[Jena]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The [[Rennsteig Cycle Way]] was opened in 2000. This designated high-grade hiking and bike trail runs along the ridge of the Thuringian Central Uplands. The bike trail, about {{cvt|200|km|0}} long, occasionally departs from the course of the historic Rennsteig hiking trail, which dates back to the 1300s, to avoid steep inclines. It is therefore about {{cvt|30|km|0}} longer than the hiking trail.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The Rennsteig is connected to the [[E3 European long distance path]], which goes from the Atlantic coast of Spain to the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, and the [[E6 European long distance path]], running from Arctic Finland to Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}

=== Education ===
After reunification, the educational system was reorganized. The [[University of Erfurt]], founded in 1379<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and closed in 1816, was refounded in 1994 with a focus on social sciences, modern languages, humanities and teacher training. Today there are approximately 6,000 students working within four faculties, the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, and three academic research institutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/faculties-institutes-services/ |title=Faculties, Institutes & Services |access-date=31 January 2016 |archive-date=28 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328130639/https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/faculties-institutes-services/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The university has an international reputation and participates in international student exchange programmes.<ref>[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/international/incoming/ Universität Efurt.
