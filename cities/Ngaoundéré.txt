'''Ngaoundéré''' or '''N'Gaoundéré''' (Fula: N'gamdere, {{script/Arabic|نغَمْدٜرٜ}}, 𞤲'𞤺𞤢𞤥𞤣𞤫𞥅𞤪𞤫𞥅) is the capital of the [[Adamawa Region]] of [[Cameroon]]. It had a population of 152,700 at the 2005 census. According to the film ''Les Mairuuwas – Maitre de l'eau'' produced by the [[University of Tromsø]],{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} the population has rapidly risen to 1,000,000 (as of October 2016) owing to mass immigration from the [[Central African Republic]] and the perceived danger from [[Boko Haram]] in northern Cameroon.

The city lies at the northern end of [[Rail transport in Cameroon|the railway]] to [[Yaoundé]] and is also home to [[Ngaoundéré Airport]]. Attractions in the city include the [[Lamido Palace]] and the [[Lamido Grand Mosque]]. The town is named after a nearby mountain on its [[Ngaoundere Plateau|eponymous plateau]]; the mountain's name is the [[Mbum language|Mbum]] word for "[[belly button|navel]] mountain". "Ngaou" mean mountain in [[Mbum language|Mbum]],  and "Ndare" mean navel in [[Mbum language|Mbum]] language. Because of this some people call the navel of [[Adamawa Region|Adamwa]]. Mount Ngaoundéré is rockey. On the top of mountain, large stone lies on it. Ngaoundéré is close to Lake Tison.

==History==
[[File:King's palace Ngaoundere.PNG|thumb|Lamidat de Ngaoundéré]]
The site of modern Ngaoundéré had previously been occupied by a [[Mbum]] capital, but the present city dates from around 1835, when it was founded by the [[Fula people|Fulani]] leader [[Ardo Njobdi]]. The Fula continued to hold the area during the 19th century and Ngaoundéré was visited in 1882 by [[Eduard Robert Flegel|Robert Flegel]].<ref name="americana">{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Flegel, Eduard Robert|year=1920}}</ref> [[Ardo Muhammadu Abbo]] signed a [[protectorate|protection agreement]] with the [[German Empire|German]] explorer [[Siegfried Passarge]] in 1894 and a series of agreements between Germany, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and [[French Third Republic|France]] placed the area within Germany's [[German Cameroon|sphere of influence]]. The German army occupied the town (period {{langx|de|Ngaundere}}) by main force on August 20, 1901. On July 29, 1915, the town was the scene of [[Battle of Ngaundere|a skirmish between German and British troops]] during [[World War I]]'s [[Kamerun campaign]]. Following the war, the area fell under [[French Cameroon|French occupation]] until the independence of Cameroon.

===Population===
[[File:NgaoCameroon.jpg|thumb|250px]]

The Mbum were the earlier population of the surrounding area before the 19th-century invasion of the [[Fulani]]. The Fulani have ruled the area since the foundation of Ngaoundere in approximately 1835 in conjunction with the Mbum, who are considered a protected people according to Islamic law. The ruler is required to be descended from the ruling Fulani family on his father's side, extending back to the first [[Lamido]] of Ngaoundéré Ardo Njobdi of Boundang. On his mother's side, he is expected to be an Mbum descendant, so that he may represent the entirety of the population. Being the largest city in the Adamawa Region by far, Ngaoundéré attracts numerous settlers from the surrounding rural areas, including Díi from further north, [[Gbaya people|Gbaya]] from the [[Meiganga]] area and [[:fr:Pere (peuple)|Pere]] from the west. The population expanded greatly after completion of the railway in 1973, with a large percentage of the additional population originating from outside of Adamawa Region. This is evident in the ironic dichotomy between the so-called Grand Marché, adjacent to the Grand Mosqué and housing mainly local merchants, and the much larger Petit Marché located to the northwest in a neighbourhood housing a population largely originating in the southern regions of Cameroon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Climate==
Ngaoundéré has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'').

== Communications ==
The city serves as an important communications hub, linking the south of Cameroon with the northern part of the country.
 
=== Rail ===
The [[Camrail]] [[Rail transport in Cameroon|railway]] from [[Yaoundé]] ends here, and [[Ngaoundéré Central Station]] is always sprawling with life. An extension of this railway 700&nbsp;km to Chad was approved in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bollore-africa-logistics.com/en/media/news/cameroon-chad-railway.html |title=Cameroon-Chad railway |access-date=2015-04-24 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150424101923/http://www.bollore-africa-logistics.com/en/media/news/cameroon-chad-railway.html |archive-date=2015-04-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
According to a report from [https://www.businessincameroon.com/infrastructures/2207-7294-afdb-will-release-fcfa-3-billion-for-studies-on-project-for-extension-of-cameroonian-railway-to-chad Business in Cameroon], the Cameroonian government and the African Development Bank group (AfDB) signed on 19 July 2017 in Yaoundé, a memorandum on the feasibility studies for the project to extend the Cameroonian railway to Chad, from the Cameroon Railways (Camrail) terminal in Ngaoundéré, the Adamawa regional capital, in northern Cameroon.

=== Road ===
There is a paved road, albeit with some potholes, extending from Ngaoundéré to [[Garoua]] and [[Maroua]], and [[Chad]].
The main goods are bananas, fruits and general goods from the south. The north sends [[cotton]] stemming from North and Chad, and cattle from [[Adamawa Region|Adamaoua]] towards the south.

=== Air ===
[[Ngaoundéré Airport]] has a 1.6&nbsp;km strip, capable of accepting Boeing 737 and similar aircraft. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the airport had several flights a week to both [[Yaoundé]] and [[Douala]] in the south, [[Garoua]] in the north, and [[N'Djamena]], Chad. Because of economic decline and the decline of the national carrier, [[Cameroon Airlines]], the airport currently sees very little traffic, if any. The airports [[ICAO]] code is FKKN while the [[IATA]] code is NGE.

=== Radio ===
Ngaoundéré is linked to the Cameroonian microwave network, but the system is not very reliable. The [[Fula language|Fulani]] radio station Sawtu Linjiila is located in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nordcamerouninfos.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/decouverte-radio-sawtu-linjiila-44-ans-au-service-de-levangelisation/|title=Découverte : Radio Sawtu Linjiila, 44 ans au service de l'évangélisation|date=April 16, 2010|website=Nord Cameroun Infos|access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>

=== Internet ===
Many private companies have two-way satellite communications and there are many cybercafés in the city.

== Mining ==
There are [[Aluminium in Africa|bauxite]] deposits in the vicinity, especially at [[Minim, Martap|Minim]], [[Martap]].<ref>[[African Business]] December 2009, p62</ref> [[File:View_from_Mt_Ngaoundere.jpg|thumb|View from Mount Ngaoundere]]

== Religion ==

Among the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ngaoundéré|Diocese of Ngaoundéré]] is a [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]] whose current bishop is [[:fr:Emmanuel Abbo|Emmanuel Abbo]].
