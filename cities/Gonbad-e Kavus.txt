The modern name, meaning "the tower of Kavus", is a reference to the most imposing ancient monument in the city. The historic name cannot now be restored, because it was assigned to the neighboring historical city of [[Astarabad]] in the 1930s by the Iranian government. At one point, it was even known as the city of Dasht-e Gorgan,<ref>{{GEOnet3|-3064799}}</ref> meaning "the Plains of Gorgan".

In the historical times, the city's populations were made up of various [[Iranic]] peoples such as the ancient and [[:wikt:eponym|eponymous]] [[Hyrcanians]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and eventually the Khurasani [[Persians]].{{cn|date=June 2023}} Today, however, the population is a mix of [[Turkmens]], [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]],<ref>[http://golestanema.com/news/%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A8%D9%87%20%D9%88%20%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%B1/%D8%A2%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A2%D8%B0%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%DA%AF%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2 Golestannma]</ref> [[Sistani Persians|Sistanis]], [[Baloch people|Baluch]], Semnanis, and Khorasanis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gonbadcity.ir/HomePage.aspx?TabID=4670&Site=DouranPortal&Lang=fa-IR|title=شهرداری گنبد کاووس|work=gonbadcity.ir|access-date=31 August 2013|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801044948/http://gonbadcity.ir/HomePage.aspx?TabID=4670&Site=DouranPortal&Lang=fa-IR|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city is famous for its historic brick tower of the same name. The city has an ethnically diverse population and the biggest ethnic group is [[Persians]] followed by Iranian Azeris and Turkmens. The Persians and Iranian Azeris tend to mainly follow [[Shia Islam]] while the [[Turkmens]] are mostly [[Sunni Muslim]].

{{See also|Great Wall of Golestan|Gonbad-e Qabus (tower)}}
The "Divar-e Gorgan" (Persian for "The Great Wall of Gorgan") is a gigantic defensive wall built in the [[Sasanian]] period of Iranian history. The visible remains are about {{convert|155|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.  It is one of the most outstanding and gigantic architectural monuments in northeast Iran and the most impressive in the [[Golestan Province]]. This wall, which is the largest defensive wall in the world after the [[Wall of China|Great Wall of China]], starts from the Caspian sea coast, circles north of the city of Gonbad-e Kāvus, continues towards the northeast, and vanishes into the [[Pishkamar]] Mountains.

At certain points, the Divar is {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and in other parts the width is {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}, depending on the  nature of the land and the soil type. Watch towers and forts had been built at vaying distances. The longest distance between forts is {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} and the shortest is {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The 40 identified forts vary in dimension and shape but the majority are square fortresses. Due to many difficulties in development and agricultural projects, archaeologists have been assigned to mark the boundary of the historical find by laying cement blocks.

The Divar defensive wall has also been known variously as Alexander Dam, Anushirvân Dam, Firuz Dam and Golestan's Defense Wall in various historical texts.

Dr. Kiani, who led the archaeological team in 1971, believes that the wall was built during the Parthian dynasty, simultaneously with the construction of the Great Wall of China, and that it was restored during the [[Sassanid]] era (3rd to 7th centuries AD).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Neolithic period==
During the [[Neolithic]] period, this area had many populated settlements. For example, Yarim Tepe (Iran). The [[Jeitun]] culture started before 6000 BC.
