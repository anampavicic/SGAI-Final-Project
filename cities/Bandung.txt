The city lies in a [[river basin]] surrounded by [[volcanic]] mountains that provide a natural defence system, which was the primary reason for the [[Dutch East Indies]] government's plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung.<ref>TF-FES</ref>

The Dutch first established tea [[plantation]]s around the mountains in the 18th century, and a road was constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] ({{convert|180|km|0|abbr=off}} to the northwest). In the early 20th century, the Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment of a municipality (''gemeente''), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, cafés, and European boutiques were opened, leading the city to be nicknamed ''Parijs van Java'' ({{langx|nl|"The Paris of Java"}}).

After [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesia declared independence]] in 1945, the city experienced ongoing development and urbanization, transforming from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km<sup>2</sup> (per square kilometre) metropolitan area with living space for over 8 million people. New [[skyscraper]]s, high-rise buildings, bridges, and gardens have been constructed. [[Natural resource]]s have been heavily exploited, particularly by conversion of the protected upland area into highland villas and real estate. Although the city has encountered many problems (ranging from waste disposal and floods to a complicated traffic system resulting from a lack of road infrastructure), it still attracts large numbers of tourists, weekend sightseers, and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. In 2017 the city won a regional environmental sustainability award for having the cleanest air among major cities in [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/bandung-wins-cleanest-air-award-asean/|title=Bandung Wins Cleanest Air Award From Asean|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|access-date=13 September 2017}}</ref> The city is also known as a [[Smart City]], leveraging technology to improve government services and social media that alert residents to issues such as floods or traffic jams.

The first Asian-African Conference, the [[Bandung Conference]], was hosted in Bandung by President [[Sukarno]] in 1955 and now decennial event. Redevelopment of the existing [[Husein Sastranegara International Airport]] (BDO) was completed in 2016. The new larger second airport for Greater Bandung [[Kertajati International Airport]] (KJT) opened in June 2018, just in time for the [[2018 Asian Games]].

==History==
{{main|History of Bandung}}
[[File:Coat of Arms of Bandung (1928).svg|230px|thumb|Coat of Arms of Bandung during the Dutch colonial era, granted in 1928]]
The official name of the city during the colonial Dutch East Indies period was '''Bandoeng'''. The earliest reference to the area dates back to 1488, although archaeological findings suggest a type of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' species had long previously lived on the banks of the Cikapundung River and around the old lake of Bandung.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=B.

In 1786, a supply road connecting Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]), [[Bogor]], [[Cianjur]], Bandung, [[Sumedang]] and [[Cirebon]] was constructed. In 1809, [[Napoleon]] ordered Governor [[Herman Willem Daendels]] to improve the defensive systems of [[Java]] to protect against a possible [[British Empire|British]] invasion. Daendels ordered the construction of a road stretching approximately {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the west to the east coast of Java, passing through Bandung.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pramoedya sheds light on dark side of Daendels highway|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=8 January 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author1=Peter J.M.

Under Daendels' orders, R. A. Wiranatakusumah II, the Chief Administrator of the Bandung regency at that time, moved the office from Krapyak, in the south, to a place near a pair of holy city wells (''sumur Bandung''), the present-day site of the city square (''alun-alun''). He built his ''dalem'' (palace), ''masjid agung'' (the grand mosque) and ''pendopo'' (public-official meeting place) in the classical Sundanese orientation,<ref>{{cite book|title=Wajah Bandung Tempoe Doeloe|author=Kunto, Haryanto|year=1984|publisher=Granesia}}</ref> with the pendopo facing [[Tangkuban Perahu]] mountain, which was believed to have a mystical ambience. In 1856, Bandung also became the capital of the [[Preanger Regencies Residency]], which it would remain until 1925.

The first major railroad between Batavia and Bandung was completed in 1880,<ref name=creative>{{cite conference|book-title=The eleventh International Planning History Conference 2023 |title=jasa izin bpom bandung: Bandung Experience |year=2022|url=https://bisainjasa.com/jasa-bpom/}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> boosting the light industry in Bandung. [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] flocked into the city to help run facilities, services and vendors. The area adjacent to the train station is still recognisable as the old Chinatown district. In 1906, Bandung was given the status of ''gemeente'' (municipality), and then twenty years later, ''stadsgemeente'' (city municipality).

From the early 1920s, the Dutch East Indies government made plans to move their capital from Batavia to Bandung. Accordingly, during this decade, the Dutch colonial government commenced construction of military barracks, the building housing the colonial Department of State-Owned Enterprises (''Department van Gouvernmentsbedrijven'', the present-day [[Gedung Sate]]) and other government buildings. However, this plan was cut short by [[World War II]], after which the Dutch were not able to re-establish their colony due to the Indonesian Declaration of Independence.

The fertile area of the Parahyangan Mountains surrounding Bandung supports productive [[tea]] plantations. In the nineteenth century, [[Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn|Franz Junghuhn]] introduced the [[cinchona]] (''kina'') plant.<ref>{{cite news|title=If Only Junghuhn Knows How Cinchona in Indonesia Becomes... |publisher=Pikiran Rakyat |language=id |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0604/07/0108.htm |date=7 June 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517024534/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0604/07/0108.htm |archive-date=17 May 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> With its cooler elevated landscape, surrounded by major plantations, Bandung became an exclusive European resort area.<ref name=brief>{{cite web  | title = An Extremely Brief Urban History of Bandung | publisher = Institute of Indonesian Architectural Historian | url=http://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~fujimori/lsai/bandung.html| access-date = 20 August 2006 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060716093926/http://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~fujimori/lsai/bandung.html| archive-date= 16 July 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> Wealthy plantation owners visited the city on weekends, attracting ladies and business people from the capital, Batavia.

Two [[art-deco]] style hotels, Savoy Homann and Preanger, were built in the vicinity of the Concordia Society, a clubhouse for the wealthy with a large ballroom and a theatre.<ref name=creative/>

After [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesian independence]] in 1945, Bandung was designated as the capital of [[West Java]] [[province]]. During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], some of the most massive battles occurred in and around Bandung. Dutch troops were virtually absent in Java at the end of World War II. To assist the restoration of Dutch sovereignty, British forces established a military presence in several of Java's largest cities, and issued an ultimatum to Indonesian forces in Bandung in an attempt to make leave the city. In response, on 24 March 1946, much of the southern part of Bandung was [[Bandung Sea of Fire|deliberately set alight]] by Indonesian forces as they withdrew.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf|title=Social History of Bandung Lautan Api (Bandung Sea of Fire) 24 March 1946 |author=Sitaresmi, Ratnayu |access-date=22 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603233047/http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf |archive-date=3 June 2017 }}</ref>

In 1955, the first Asian-African Conference, also known as the ''[[Bandung Conference]]'', was hosted in Bandung by President [[Sukarno]] and attended by the heads of states representing twenty-nine independent countries from Asia and Africa.<ref>Jamie Mackie, 'Bandung 1955: Non-Alignment and Afro-Asian Solidarity', [[Singapore]], Editions Didier Millet, {{ISBN|981-4155-49-7}}</ref> The conference venue was at the [[Gedung Merdeka]], the former Concordia Society building. The conference announced ten points of declaration for the promotion of [[world peace]] and opposition against [[colonialism]] and is known as the [[Bandung Conference#Declaration|Declaration of Bandung]]. This was followed by a wave of nationalism and [[decolonisation]] movements around the globe which remapped world politics.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cold War II: The Eisenhower Administration, the Bandung Conference, and the Reperiodization of the Postwar Era| author=Jason Parker| journal=Diplomatic History| volume=30| issue=5| year=2006| pages=867–892| doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2006.00582.x}}</ref> The conference was also the first international conference of people of colour in history.<ref name="wright">{{cite book|title=The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference| author=Richard Wright| author-link=Richard Wright (author)| publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1995|isbn=0-87805-748-X}}</ref> In his book ''[[The Color Curtain]]'', [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] claims that there was an epic meaning to the conference for people of colour around the world.<ref name="wright"/>

In 1987, the city boundary was expanded by the 'Greater Bandung' (''Bandung Raya'') plan, with the relocation of higher concentration development zones outside the city in an attempt to dilute population density in the old city. During this development, the [[City centre|city core]] was often uprooted, with old buildings torn down, lot sizes regrouped and rezoned, changing idyllic residential areas to commercial zones with bustling chain supermarkets, malls, banks and upscale developments.<ref name=brief/>

In 2005, an Asian-African Conference was partly held in Bandung, attended by world leaders including Indonesian President Susilo B. Yudhoyono, President of China Hu Jintao, Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh, President of [[South Africa]] Thabo Mbeki and President of [[Nigeria]] Obasanjo.<ref name="Discover Bandung">[http://discoverbandung.chasecareer.net Discover Bandung] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307003733/http://discoverbandung.chasecareer.net/ |date=7 March 2013}}</ref>

Its elevation is {{convert|768|m|ft}} [[above sea level]] and is surrounded by up to {{convert|2400|m|abbr=off}} high [[Tertiary|Late Tertiary]] and [[Quaternary]] volcanic terrain.<ref name="Kaars95">{{cite journal |title=A 135,000-year record of vegetational and climatic change from the Bandung area, West-Java, Indonesia |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=117 |issue=1–2 |pages=55–72 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(94)00121-N |author1=W.A. van der Kaars |author2=M.A.C.

The northern section of Bandung is hillier than other parts of the city, and the unique truncated flat-peak shape of the [[Mount Tangkuban Perahu|Tangkuban Perahu]] volcano (''Tangkuban Perahu'' literally means 'upside-down boat') can be seen from the city to the north. Long-term volcanic activity has created fertile [[andisols|andisol]] soil in the north, suitable for intensive [[rice]], [[fruit]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], and [[coffee]] plantations. In the [[south]] and [[east]], [[alluvial]] soils deposited by the Cikapundung river predominate.<ref>{{Cite web

[[File:Savoy Homann (264088335).jpeg|upright|thumb|220px|The [[Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel]] architectural design by [[Albert Aalbers]] in 1939 is one of the most significant examples of the [[Art Deco]] style for which Bandung is renowned.]]
Bandung is home to numerous examples of Dutch colonial architecture, most notably the tropical Art Deco, dubbed [[New Indies Style]]. [[Henri Maclaine Pont]] was among the first Dutch architects to recognise the importance of combining each architectural style with local cultural traditions. He stressed that [[modern architecture]] should interact with [[local history]] and native elements.<ref name="ww">{{cite conference|author1=W. Wangsadinata |author2=T.K. Djajasudarma |name-list-style=amp |title=Architectural Design Consideration for Modern Buildings in Indonesia |year=1995 |book-title=INDOBEX Conf. on Building Construction Technology for the Future: Construction Technology for Highrises & Intelligence Buildings |location=Jakarta |url=http://www.wiratman.co.id/ximages/architecture.pdf|access-date=18 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614232909/http://www.wiratman.co.id/ximages/architecture.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2007}}</ref> In 1920, Pont planned and designed buildings for the first technical university in the [[Dutch East Indies]], ''Technische Hogeschool te Bandung'' (the present-day [[Bandung Institute of Technology]]). He was named a Professor of Architecture at the university. A striking local Sundanese roof style is seen adorning the top of the campus' ceremonial hall and is embedded in his artwork.<ref name="ww"/>

In the same year, another Dutch architect J Gerber designed ''Gouverments Bedrijven'' (Government Companies) in line with the colonial government's plan to move the capital from Batavia to Bandung. The building is known as [[Gedung Sate]], named after the distinguished small [[satay]]-shaped structure on the roof, and is today used as the head office of the [[West Java]] provincial government and House of Representatives. The building is an example of a harmonious mixture between West and East architectural styles, particularly the [[Italian Renaissance]] style of [[arch]] structures in the wings and [[pendopo]]-like structures commonly found in Java in the middle section.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Villa Isola aan de Lembangweg bij Bandoeng TMnr 60026636.jpg|upright|thumb|170px|[[Villa Isola]], is an art-deco building in the northern part of Bandung, now it serves as the rectorate building of [[Indonesia University of Education]].]]
Several Dutch architects who shaped the city landmarks the architectural blending of modern and native traditions. In the 1930s, Bandung became known as an architectural laboratory due to the many Dutch architects who experimented with new architectural designs. [[Albert Aalbers]] added the [[streamline moderne]] style to the Art Deco by designing the DENIS bank (1936) and renovating the Savoy Homann Hotel (1939). [[Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker]] was one of the architects who enormously added native elements in his artworks, including the [[Villa Isola]] (1932), Hotel Preanger (1929), the regional military headquarters (1918), [[Gedung Merdeka]] (1921) and ITB Rectorate Building (1925).<ref name="ww"/>

Though Bandung is known for its many old Dutch architecture buildings, the city is recently going through a high-rise building boom. There are more than 100 high rise buildings in the city, and many more are under construction or planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/city/100261/bandung-indonesia/type/3/1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815102414/https://www.emporis.com/city/100261/bandung-indonesia/type/3/1|url-status=usurped|archive-date=15 August 2017|title=High-rise buildings in Bandung}}</ref> The following list includes buildings in Bandung that are completed or topped off and above {{Convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

===Environmental problems===
The north of the city serves as a [[water reservoir]] for Bandung. However, the area has seen substantial residential development. Several attempts to protect this area have been made, including creating reserves such as the Juanda National Park and [[Punclut]], but development continues. Regular flooding in Bandung's south also presents a real and dangerous ongoing problem.<ref>{{cite conference| first = Agus| last = Fahmudin| author2 = Wahyunto| title = Evaluation of Flood Mitigation Function of Several Land Use Systems in Selected Areas of West Java, Indonesia| book-title = Japan / OECD Expert Meeting on Land Conservation Indicators| publisher = OECD| url = http://www.olis.oecd.org/comnet/agr/landconserv.nsf/viewHtml/index/$FILE/Fahmuddin.PDF| access-date = 20 August 2006| archive-date = 9 April 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409140209/http://www.olis.oecd.org/comnet/agr/landconserv.nsf/viewHtml/index/$FILE/Fahmuddin.PDF| url-status = dead}}</ref>

From mid-2005, Bandung faced another environmental disaster when the city's [[landfill]] site was re-evaluated after a garbage slide in 2005 which buried a village, Kampung Gajah, beneath it, killing over a hundred people.<ref>SP 18 May 2006 http://www.sp18.com/2006/05/</ref> The accumulation of {{convert|8000|m3/day|abbr=on}} of domestic garbage causes severe air pollution by local burning, the spread of disease, and water contamination.

===Climate===
Bandung experiences [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Am'') that closely borders a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Af'') as the driest month precipitation total is below {{convert|60|mm}}. The wettest month is February, with a precipitation total of {{convert|255.0|mm}}, while the driest month is September, with a precipitation total of {{convert|50.0|mm}}. The average temperature throughout the year tends to be cooler than most cities in Indonesia due to the influence of altitude. The average temperature throughout the year only has little variation due to its location near the equator.

==Economy==
[[File:Bandung, Bandung City, West Java, Indonesia - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Trans Studio Bandung|Trans Studio Mall Bandung]], is the second largest shopping mall in Bandung after ''Paris Van Java Mall''.]]
The city's economy is mainly built upon tourism, business, [https://sttiss.ac.id/berita/detail/uir-terjunkan-29-mahasiswa-dalam-ekspedisi-nusantara-jaya creative industry], high-tech and manufacturing industries, educational institutions, technology, retail services, financial services, pharmaceutical companies, and food production.<ref name="Discover Bandung"/> The once quiet residential district of Dago has become an important business and entertainment centre with chic cafés and restaurants spread out along Jalan Dago. In the early 1990s, Jalan Cihampelas became a popular clothing store location and remains so today. Some important shopping malls of the city which are [[Trans Studio Bandung|Trans Studio Mall Bandung]], Summarecon Mall Bandung, Bandung Indah Plaza, Cihampelas Walk, Paris Van Java Mall, and 23 Paskal Shopping Center are among the popular shopping centres in Bandung.

Creative culture has shaped specific parts of the city's economy. Small businesses, known as "distro", sell non-[[trademark]]ed products made by local designers. Typical distro products are books, indie label records, magazines, fashion products, and other accessories. Distros are popular with young people and distance themselves from factory outlets in terms of [[philosophy]]. They arise from individual designers and young entrepreneurs, while factory outlet products generally come from large-scale garment factories.<ref>{{cite news|title=From Indie to Magic |url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0308/22/muda/504835.htm |language=id |newspaper=Kompas |date=22 August 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134336/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0308/22/muda/504835.htm |archive-date=29 September 2007 }}</ref>

The city administration has agreed to substantially develop seven industrial and trade areas for Bandung speciality products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/179610 |title=Tujuh Sentra Industri Jadi Ciri Bandung 2013 |date=6 March 2012 |access-date=6 March 2012 |archive-date=28 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228190752/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/179610 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These include Binong Jati Knitting Industrial and Trade Center, Cigondewah Textile Trade Center, Cihampelas Jeans Trade Center, Suci (T and Oblong) Shirt Industrial Center, Cibaduyut Shoes Industrial Center, Cibuntu Tofu and Tempeh Industrial Center, Sukamulya Sukajadi Doll Industrial Center.

Bandung is a popular [[weekend]] destination for residents of Jakarta. The colder climate of the highland plantation area, variety of food, less expensive [[fashion]] shops located in factory outlets and [[#Economy|distros]], golf courses, and the [[Bandung Zoo|zoo]], are some of the attractions of the city.<ref>Java Experience http://travel.ciao.co.uk/Java_Experience_5297272_5 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508000354/http://travel.ciao.co.uk/Java_Experience_5297272_5 |date=8 May 2006}}</ref> Bandung is also a popular shopping destination due to the cheap textile and fashion products, especially for [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] and [[Singaporean people|Singaporean]] tourists.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/16/malaysians-flock-bandung-shop.html Malaysians flock to Bandung to shop]</ref>

In the 1990s, local designers opened denim clothing stores along Jalan Cihampelas, which was transformed into a "jeans street". The city attracts people from other big cities to buy local fashion wares, as they are cheaper than branded items.<ref>Asia Travel http://www.asiatravel.com/bandinfo.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828161046/http://asiatravel.com/bandinfo.html |date=28 August 2006 }}</ref> Beside Jalan Cihampelas, many factory outlets also opened at Jalan Riau, [[Braga Street|Jalan Braga]], Jalan Setiabudi, and Jalan [[Djuanda]] (known as [[Dago, Indonesia|Dago]]). Textile factories on the outskirts of Bandung have opened factory outlets on site selling what is marketed as ''sisa export'' (rejected or over-produced export quality items).<ref>The Lively Pulse of Bandung {{cite web|url=http://www.thingsasian.com/goto_article/article.2543.html |title=The Lively Pulse of Bandung -- ThingsAsian Article |access-date=2006-08-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427183652/http://www.thingsasian.com/goto_article/article.2543.html |archive-date=27 April 2006 }}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
 [[File:Bandung pasopati.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Pasupati Bridge]] is the most famous bridge in Bandung and second length bridges in Indonesia]]
Bandung can be accessed by highways from Jakarta. An intercity toll highway called [[Cipularang Toll Road]], connecting Jakarta, [[Karawang]], [[Purwakarta]], Padalarang and Bandung, was completed in May 2005, and is the fastest way to reach Bandung from the capital by road. Driving time is about 1.5 hours on average. There are three other options: the Puncak route (Jakarta-[[Cianjur]]/[[Sukabumi]]-Bandung), Purwakarta route (Jakarta-Cikampek-Purwakarta-Cikalong Wetan-Padalarang-Cimahi-Bandung) and the Subang route (Jakarta-[[Cikampek]]-[[Subang, Indonesia|Subang]]-[[Lembang]]-Bandung). From cities further east ([[Cirebon]], [[Tasikmalaya]] and [[Central Java]] province), Bandung can be accessed through the main provincial road. [[Indonesian National Route 3]] links Bandung with the rest of Java towards [[Cilegon]] and Ketapang ([[Banyuwangi]]).

The [[Pasupati Bridge]] was built to relieve traffic congestion in the city for east–west transport. The {{convert|2.8|km|1|adj=on}} [[cable-stayed bridge]] lies through the Cikapundung Valley. It is {{convert|30|to|60|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide and, after extensive delays, it was finally completed in June 2005, following financial investment from [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Kuwait Investasikan 1,5 Milyar Dollar AS di Indonesia|trans-title=Kuwait invested USD 1.5 billion in Indonesia|url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0209/14/ekonomi/kuwa14.htm|work=Kompas|language=id|date=14 October 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311083734/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0209/14/ekonomi/kuwa14.htm|archive-date=11 March 2007}}</ref> The bridge is part of Bandung's comprehensive inner-city highways plan.

Bandung has two intercity bus terminals: Leuwipanjang, serving buses from the west, and Cicaheum, serving buses from the east. Both are at full capacity and are to be replaced by a new terminal at Gedebage on {{convert|15|ha}} land, after which the old terminals will function as inner-city terminals. The new terminal will be located next to the Gedebage railway station near Gedebage container dry port.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/147232|title=Bappeda Targetkan Studi Kelaikan Terminal Gedebage Selesai Tahun Ini|work=Pikiran Rakyat|date=2 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152413/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/147232|archive-date=24 March 2012}}</ref>

=== Transportation ===
[[Taxicab|Taxis]] and [[Carpooling|Online transport]] are widely available. The primary means of public transportation is by ''[[Share taxi#Indonesia|angkot]]'' minibuses (from ''angkutan'', "transportation" and ''kota'', "city"); ''angkot'' are privately operated and serve multiple routes throughout the city, and although cheap, they are considered basic and uncomfortable.<ref>[http://www.bandung.world-guides.com/bandung_travel.html Bandung Transport and Car Rental: Bandung, West Java, Indonesia]</ref> To find exact angkot routes, passengers may look for information available through the drivers or at terminals.

Due to the current extent of railway lines in Bandung, only two named regional railway services, ''Lokal Bandung Raya'' and ''Lokal Garut Cibatuan'', are serving the city, serving a single line. It catered for the suburban areas east and west of the city such as [[Cimahi]], [[Padalarang, West Bandung|Padalarang]], Rancaekek, Cicalengka, as well as some other neighbouring towns such as Garut and Purwakarta. KAI Commuter took over the operations of both services from its mother company KAI in 2022, anticipating planned electrification of the route by Ministry of Transport.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Farozy |first=Ikko Haidar |date=2022-03-28 |title=KAI Commuter Ambil Alih Lokal Bandung dan Surabaya? |url=https://redigest.web.id/2022/03/kai-commuter-ambil-alih-lokal-bandung-dan-surabaya/ |access-date=2022-06-23 |website=Railway Enthusiast Digest |language=id-ID}}</ref>
