It is the main and biggest town of the bigger entity region or area of the same name, Muar which is sub-divided into the Muar district and the new [[Tangkak District|Tangkak district]], which was upgraded into a full-fledged district from the [[Tangkak]] sub-district earlier.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/20/nation/16075342&sec=nation Muar to say goodbye to Tangkak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901175413/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F20%2Fnation%2F16075342&sec=nation|date=1 September 2012}}, 20 November 2006, [[The Star (Malaysia)]]</ref> Muar district as the only district covering the whole area formerly borders [[Malacca]] in the northern part.

However, both divided administrative districts are still collectively and fondly called and referred to as the region or area of Muar as a whole by their residents and outsiders. Currently, the new township of Muar is located in the Bakri area.

Muar is one of the cleanest cities in South East Asia, being awarded with Asean Clean Tourist City Standard Award 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mix.my/article/trending-on-mix/muar-gets-clean-tourist-city-award |title=Muar Gets Honoured With Asean Clean Tourist City Award|publisher=MIX |access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2024}}
Muar also known as Bandar Maharani is said to have had other names earlier and the name itself Muar is believed to have originated and derived from its geographical location at the mouth or [[estuary]] of [[Muar River]] as the following different version of theories:
* '''Teluk Dalam''': Muar was formerly known as ''Teluk Dalam'' meaning "deep bay" due to its location at the estuary or the structure of the mouth of the Muar River which is wide open and deep; based on a sentence in one part of '''Hikayat Malim Deman'''; as in :

:'''Muar belum bernama Muar, Muar bernama Teluk Dalam.''' (Muar has not been named Muar, Muar is called Teluk Dalam)

* '''Muara''': Muar name is said to be the summary for this old [[Malay Language|Malay]] word ''Muara'' meaning "the wide open estuary".
* '''Muak''': Means "bored" or "tired" in paddling the boat travelling along the river which is large and curvy by the local people in the early days. The people started calling the river and place Muar deriving from the word ''Muak'' after a long time since then.
* ''' Bukit Mor''': There is also a hill not far from the Muar near [[Parit Jawa]] in the south of the "Padang" area called ''Mor Hill'' or ''Bukit Mor'' which may be the origin of the name of Muar.
* '''Bandar Maharani''': Modern Muar Town was officially opened and conferred Bandar Maharani title by [[Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor|Maharaja Abu Bakar]] translated as the Town of Empress the namesake of Maharani Fatimah who also graced the grand inauguration ceremony of the new town on 12 August 1887, to symbolically representing and recognising the prominence status of Muar as the second important and biggest town and district of the state of Johor after Johor Bahru the capital city in those days.

There a few old historic legends which evolved around the area of Muar namely, ''Hikayat Malim Deman (Epic of Malim Deman), Legenda Lembing Awang Pulang Ke Dayang (Awang's Spear Return to Dayang Legend) and Legenda Puteri Gunung Ledang (Mount Ledang Princess' Legend)''.

Muar is rich in history as mentioned in many historical records and archaeological works.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Keyvanfar |first1=Ali |last2=Shafaghat |first2=Arezou |last3=Mohamad |first3=Sapura |last4=Abdullahi |first4=Mu'azu |last5=Ahmad |first5=Hamidah |last6=Mohd Derus |first6=Nurul |last7=Khorami |first7=Majid  |year=2018  |title=A Sustainable Historic Waterfront Revitalization Decision Support Tool for Attracting Tourists

There were many accounts recorded about the early history of Muar. In 1361, it was claimed that Muar was a part of the [[Majapahit]] empire. Another account also stated that [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], upon his exile from [[Temasik]] before proceeding to found Melaka, had established some settlements at [[Kota Buruk]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first=C.

Historically, Muar was also where the deposed heir of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] escaped to in 1511 following the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Portuguese invasion]] launched from Goa by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]]. Muar played a role in resisting the Portuguese occupation of Malacca; the [[Kubu Bentayan]] fort was built by [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Sultan Mahmud Shah]] to repel seaborne invasions, before he was defeated and retreated further to [[Pagoh]], this time witnessing the fall of his empire.{{citation needed |date=May 2024}}

The Portuguese occupied Muar after that and built a fortress named [[Fortaleza de Muar]] to defend the colony against the attack of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Acheh|Aceh]] instead at the same strategic site of Bentayan. The colonial British did just about the same thing at the Muar River site near Bentayan in defence against the advance of [[Japanese Imperial Army]] in the [[Battle of Muar]] in [[World War II]].{{citation needed |date=May 2024}} Muar is also the home for the one and only tomb of the seventh Malacca Sultanate, [[Alauddin Riayat Shah of Malacca|Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah I]] (1477–1488). During the time of the beginning of [[Bugis]] immigration from [[Sulawesi]] Indonesia and their influence in Johor Sultanate, the five Bugis pioneer prince-brothers sea-warriors or rather pirates from Sulawesi, Indonesia; Daeng Marewah, [[Daeng Parani]], Daeng Celak, Daeng Manambun and Daeng Kemasi said to have come to reside in Liang Batu, [[Lenga, Johor|Lenga]], Muar before they and their descendants become the influential [[Temenggong|Temenggungs]] and even rulers later.

Muar, the Bandar Maharani, have been recorded by several historians, scholars and authors and in many important historical materials like old maps, poems, epics, manuscripts and books :
* [[Prapanca]] (1361) ([[Nagarakertagama]] Poem) :[[Nagarakertagama]] poem – written in 1361 [[Prapanca]] (a Buddhist monk and priest of [[Majapahit]] Palace) told [[Muar (district)|Muar]] as a colony part of [[Majapahit]] empire subdued by [[Hayam Wuruk]] and prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]](1350 to 1389).<ref>The story is recorded in JMBRAS magazine, October 1935, Volume XIII Part 2, page 15 to 16.</ref>
* [[João de Barros]] ("Decades of Asia"), (1553) :[[João de Barros]] who wrote in 1553 in his second Décadas da Ásia ("Decades of Asia"), a history of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in India and Asia.stated that [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] (Paramicura) who were driven away from [[Temasik]] after he killed the representative of the [[King of Siam]], Temagi; had escaped in exile and stopped in [[Muar (district)|Muar]] and built a in rural areas of [[Muar (district)|Muar]] called [[Pagoh]].
* [[Tun Sri Lanang]] ([[Malay Annals]]) Shellabear version :In the [[Malay Annals]] states that [[Temasik]] during the reign of [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara (Sultan Iskandar Shah)]] was defeated by [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]]. But he and his family including his followers had fled to [[Pagoh]], '''[[Muar (district)|Muar]]''' and opened 2 areas on the banks of the [[Muar River]]; the [[Biawak Busuk]] and another fort called [[Kota Buruk]] before moved to [[Melaka]] and opened up [[Melaka]]. In 1488, the incident of [[Malacca]]'s [[Alauddin Riayat Shah of Malacca|Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah I]] (1477–1488) who has died and buried in [[Pagoh]], Ulu Muar during a visit, called "Sultan Mangkat Di Muar".
* [[Tomé Pires]] (the [[Suma Oriental]]) (1512–1515) :Tomé Pires wrote a landmark book on Asian trade, the Suma Oriental que trata do Mar Roxo até aos Chins ([[Summa]] of the East, from the Red Sea up to the Chinese) in Malacca and India between 1512 and 1515, completed before the death of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (December 1515), which highlighted the emergence of [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] replacing his father, Raja Sam Agi as the ruler of [[Palembang]] and later attacked by the king of [[Majapahit]] of [[Java]], King Batara Tamavill for declaring himself as 'Mjeura' (those who dare) before fled to [[Temasik]](Singapore)where he killed [[King of Ayutthaya|Siamese King of Ayutthaya]]'s representative, Temagi and he secretly ruled Temasik for 5 years. But fearing the revenge attack by the [[King of Ayutthaya]], he fled to [[Pagoh]], Muar with his 1,000 followers and lived there for 6 years when the [[Seletar]] peoples were still occupying Malacca before he moved to Malacca and opened it later.
* An old [[Portugal|Portuguese]] map shows that Muar had a second Portuguese fort in the [[Peninsular Malaysia]] beside [[Malacca]]. From the map, it was named [[Fortaleza de Muar]] built in 1604 by [[Emanuel Godinho de Erédia]] in triangular shape to defend the colony against attacks from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Acheh|Aceh]], at the mouth of Bentayan River near the Muar River. It fort has since vanished but it is believed to be located at the present location of Bentayan Express Bus' Station (formerly Pagoh Bus Stand) in Jalan Maharani, Muar.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.colonialvoyage.com/malacca.html |title = The History Portuguese Malacca 1511–1641 : History of Colonial Malaysia |publisher = Marco Ramerini |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100301205223/http://www.colonialvoyage.com/malacca.html |archive-date = 1 March 2010 }}</ref>
* [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1584) (Old Maps) :Old maps such as Map Ortelius A.D. 1584 shows Muar as a city located to the south of [[Malacca]].
* [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]] (1595) (Old Maps) :Map Linschoten A.D. 1595 shows Muar as a city close to the state of Malacca.

Sultan Ali's Rule of Muar:
Muar was the royal town of northern [[Johor]] once. A civil war between the prince of [[Sultan Hussein Shah]]; [[Sultan Ali of Johor|Tengku Ali]] dan Dato' [[Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim]] which was later settled by a treaty of agreement and understanding signed in [[Singapore]] between the British and [[Sultan Ali of Johor|Tengku Ali]]; that ceded the control of the rest of state of Johor (except Muar region) formally to Temenggong Ibrahim in returns of the sultan title with the condition the title is not hereditary for succession, and recognition of him as [[Sultan Ali of Johor|Sultan Ali]] and his reign ruled over the Muar region (state) of the area lies between the Muar River and Kesang River with an annual pension from the British Government under the terms of the treaty. Although Sultan Ali was in fact the real heir of the Johor Sultanate but due to his weakness, the [[Temenggong]] became the ''de facto'' ruler instead and begin the rule of the Temenggung in Johor onwards. Sultan Ali delegated the administrative affairs of Muar to the Raja Temenggung of Muar<ref name="Suzana182">(Tun) Suzana (Tun) Othman, ''Ahlul-bait (keluarga) Rasulullah SAW & raja-raja Melayu'', pg 182</ref> (also known by the title of [[Raja Temenggung of Muar|Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar]])<ref name="Winstedt129">R. O. Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365–1941)'', pg 129</ref> and rather spent most of his time in Malacca. Muar was sparsely populated in 1855 and had a population of 800 and no formal structure of government was formed. In 1860, Sultan Ali reportedly borrowed $53,600 from a [[Chettiar]] money lender, Kavana Chana Shellapah and signed an agreement with Shellapah to contribute a portion of his monthly allowance to repay his debt. However, Sultan Ali found himself unable to pay settle his debts in time, and an angry Shellapah wrote to the British government in 1866. Pressured to liquidate his debts in time, Sultan Ali granted Shellapah the right to trade off Muar to the Raja Temenggung of Muar|Temenggong of Johor as mortgage if he is unable to pay off his debts in time.<ref>Studer, ''American and British Claims Arbitration: William Webster: Appendix to the Memorial of the United States, Vol. III'', p. 311-12</ref> His relations with Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim remained strained; in 1860, Sultan Ali allowed a Bugis adventurer, Suliwatang, the chiefs of [[Rembau District|Rembau]] and [[Sungei Ujong]] to settle in Muar and prepare themselves for an attack on Johor.<ref>''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'' (1937), p. 74</ref> Such bad blood between the Sultan Ali and Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim passed down to the Temenggong's son, Temenggong Abu Bakar, who succeeded his father after the former died in 1862. Shortly after Temenggong Abu Bakar became the Temenggong of Johor, he sent a letter to Sultan Ali to reassert of Johor's sovereignty over Segamat. Continued disputes over the sovereignty of Segamat led to an outbreak of a war between the Temenggong's men with the Sultan's. Eleven years later in 1873, attempts made by Suliwatang to collect custom taxes from inhabitants at the Muar estuary led to further conflict with Temenggong Abu Bakar's (who became Maharaja in 1868 and finally Sultan later in 1885, 8 years after death of Sultan Ali) men.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365–1941)'', p. 128-29</ref>

Upon Sultan Ali's death in [[Umbai]], Malacca in 1877, his 11-year-old youngest son, Tengku Mahmood, was named his successor, fuelling anger and dissatisfaction of his oldest son, [[Tengku Alam Shah]]. The Raja Temenggung of Muar<ref name="Suzana182"/> (also known by the title of Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar)<ref name="Winstedt129"/> and its village chieftains voted in favour of a merger of Muar with Johor following the succession dispute between the two of Sultan Ali's sons. Tengku Alam Shah, disputed the legitimacy of the chieftains' wishes and staked his hereditary claims over Muar, started to instigate and launch the 1879 [[Jementah Civil War]] in a bid to reclaim Muar, but was quickly defeated by the Maharaja Abu Bakar's forces and Muar was finally annexed and return as part of the Johor state on 30 December 1879.

During the 1880s, the sovereign rulers of Johor, Temenggong Ibrahim and his successor, Sultan Abu Bakar introduced the [[Kangchu]] system and actively encouraged the Chinese leaders to set up new [[uncaria|gambier]] and [[black pepper]] plantations and to bring in the Chinese immigrants as agricultural settlers and labourers to open and work in these plantations in Muar.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365–1941)'', pg 131-2</ref> A Western-style contracts (termed as ''Surat Sungai'' in Malay, literally "River Documents") to the [[Kapitan Cina]] (Chinese leaders) who have established the plantations along river banks in Johor. Letters of authority (''Surat Kuasa'') were issued when the first Chinese leaders began settling in Johor during the 1850s. The Temenggong quickly established goodwill relations with the Kapitan Cina by appointing one [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] administrator, [[Muhamad Salleh bin Perang]], the [[Dato' Bentara Luar]] who was able to speak the [[Teochew dialect]], the language spoken by most Kapitan Cina and settlers and able to read Chinese for these purposes.<ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', p. 140</ref> Influx of these settlers mainly of [[Teochew people|Teochew]] origin, and were generally first- or second-generation ethnic Chinese who became an important part and parcel of life and population of Muar until today and helped shape the population demographic and the social economy of Muar. There is even a town called [[Bukit Gambir]] meaning ''Hill of Gambier'' in Muar.

Modern Muar Town, known as Bandar Maharani, which is the main city center of Muar district, was founded by [[Dato' Bentara Luar]], [[Muhamad Salleh bin Perang]] in 1885 and was only officially opened by His Majesty Maharaja Abu Bakar 12 August 1887 (who just became opted Maharaja title on 30 June 1868) and conferred the namesake Bandar Maharani meaning the Town of Empress, the title of Maharani Fatimah who had accompanied to graced the inauguration ceremony of the new town at Tangga Batu a place around Hentian Maharani bus station now where an auspicious "amulet" or "azimat" is said to be buried underground there then. Muar celebrated its centenary in a grand celebration attended by the Sultan of Johor in 1984.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135715/http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/2483/rani.jpg Sultanah Johor Tanam Azimat di Muar]</ref>

The prosperity and rapid development of Muar made it the only town in Malaysia ever to have had its own local railway network in the early days. The [[Muar State Railway]] (MSR) operated from 1889 to 1925, linking Jalan Sulaiman in Bandar Maharani and Sungai Pulai for a distance of 22.5&nbsp;km. A 1916 plan to extend the line to [[Batu Pahat]] was aborted and the service totally stopped in 1925 due to financial and geographical constraints and its reduced importance after the construction of Jalan Abdul Rahman linking the Muar town and [[Parit Jawa]]. It remains a memory and is only a part of history of Muar now with just the MSR steam locomotive relic on display at Tanjung Emas Park.

In [[World War II]], the [[Battle of Muar]], 14–22 January 1942, fought around the area from [[Gemencheh]], Muar River and [[Bukit Bakri]] in Muar was the last major battle of the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan Campaign of the Battle of Malaya]], fought by [[Malaya Command|British Allied forces]] and [[Japanese order of battle during the Malayan Campaign|Japanese forces]] from 8 December 1941 – 31 January 1942 in [[British Malaya]]. The Battle of Bakri or Siege of Bakri was a fierce battle of the fighting troops in Bukit Bakri on 17 January 1942. The battle resulted in the near-annihilation of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' deployed [[45th Indian Infantry Brigade]], with heavy casualties for its two attached Australian's [[8th Division (Australia)|2/19th and 2/29th Infantry Battalions]]<ref name="AWM official histories">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/20/chapters/11.pdf|title=The Battle of Muar|publisher=AWM|access-date=30 March 2009}}</ref> and the eventual fall of Muar to the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces. During the 1942–45 [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] era, Muar continued to serve as important administration town under the occupying Japanese army with many locals involved in the bulk of anti-Japanese resistance groups such as the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army ([[MPAJA]]) and [[Force 136]].

During the [[Malayan Emergency]] period, in the [[Bukit Kepong Incident]], the police station of [[Bukit Kepong]] was ambushed and brutally attacked by members of the [[Malayan Races Liberation Army|Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), the military arm of the [[Malayan Communist Party]], on 23 February 1950 killing 26 policemen and family members.

Muar also recorded the history of resistance against the communist attacks and [[British occupation]] by Panglima Kiyai Salleh, a religious and martial arts teacher of [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] & [[Javanese people|Javanese]] origin who founded the resistance guerillas troop ''Tentera Selempang Merah''. The Group of Seven or Orang Tujuh of Muar which consists of Tun Dr Awang Hassan (the former Governor of Penang), father of Tun Dr Ismail Dato Abdul Rahman Mohd Yasin (father of Tun Dr Ismail former Deputy Prime Minister), his brother Datuk Sulaiman Abdul Rahman, Tan Sri Datuk Hassan (former Menteri Besar) and Dato Hj Kosai Mohd Salleh was said to be active fighting the formation of [[Malayan Union]] and advocating the independence of Malaya.

[[File:Map of Muar District, Johor.svg|thumb|Bandar Maharani in Muar District]]

Muar district formerly covers 2346.12&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with a population of 328,695 (2000). The town of Muar is located at the mouth of [[Muar River]].

The flat terrain of Muar's geographical ground and areas has enable the extensive use of bicycle and tricycle vehicles as the main and major mode of transportation in Muar in the early days. This believe to be the main factor and reason Muar was once the town with the most bicycles and the only town that requires valid license issued by the town council to own and use a bicycle in the country.

=== Climate ===
Muar, like the rest of peninsular Malaysia, enjoys a year-round [[equatorial climate]] which is warm and sunny, along with plentiful rainfall, especially during the southwest monsoon from April to September. The climate is very much dictated by the adjacent sea and the wind system.
In the 2006/2007 floods, unusually heavy rainfall in the states of Johor and Melaka resulted in the worst flooding in southern Peninsular Malaysia in history. Muar was not spared from this dreadful disaster which lasted almost a month. Many areas of Muar such as [[Pagoh]], [[Lenga, Johor|Lenga]], Kundang Ulu, [[Bukit Gambir]] and [[Sawah Ring]] were seriously flooded with some areas up to {{convert|10|ft|m}}. About 22,933 people were evacuated to relief centres<ref>[http://www.thestar.com.my/ The Star], 25 December 2006.</ref>

[[Muar (district)|Muar District]] was formerly divided administratively into Muar ([[Bandar Maharani]]) municipality and [[Tangkak]] township. Upon upgrade of Tangkak sub-district to full-fledged Tangkak district, Bandar Maharani of Muar is now administered by [[Majlis Perbandaran Muar|Muar Municipal Council]] (formerly South Muar Town Council, later Muar Town Council) under the Muar District Office, while Tangkak is administered by Tangkak Town Council (formerly North Muar Town Council) under the [[Tangkak District]] Office.

A new administration hub and transportation hub integrated with bus terminal and market called Maharani Sentral are being planned to be built at the location near [[Muar Bypass]] in between Jalan Haji Kosai and Jalan Temenggung.

===Car===
Besides federal roads such as [[Malaysia Federal Route 5|Federal Route 5]] that runs through Muar town centre, Muar is also accessible via the [[North–South Expressway Southern Route|PLUS Expressway]] through the Tangkak (EXIT 235), Bukit Gambir (EXIT 236), Pagoh (EXIT 238) and Yong Peng (EXIT 241) interchange exits.

Access to [[Segamat]], the closest railway station to Muar, is possible using [[Malaysia Federal Route 23|Federal Route 23]].

[[Jambatan Sultan Ismail|Sultan Ismail Bridge]], the first bridge across the [[Muar River]] is the landmark of the town, built in 1960 and completed in 1962 to replace old ferry services in the 1960s.

The new [[Muar Second Bridge]] connecting Parit Bunga at the north and Sabak Awor at the south across the river is part of the 13&nbsp;km [[Muar Bypass]] (highway [[Malaysia Federal Route 224|Federal Route 224]]) that was completed in 2005. The bridge is the latest landmark of the town. The highway that traverses through the outskirts of the town has ease the journey by diverting the traffic from downtown Muar.

Muar with status as an important trading and administrative town in the state of Johor for both the colonial British and the old Johor Sultanate in the early days has contributed in shaping the landscape of the town.

===Public transportation===
[[File:Bandar Maharani Ferry Terminal.JPG|thumb|Bandar Maharani Ferry Terminal]]

The state railway [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad|KTMB]] does not serve Muar or its environs; instead the closest station is in [[Segamat railway station|Segamat]]. Train services to the state capital [[JB Sentral|Johor Bahru]] as well as [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Ipoh]], [[Seremban]] or [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]] in Kelantan are available.

[[Muar High School]] ([[:ms:Sekolah Tinggi Muar|Sekolah Tinggi Muar]])(麻坡高级中学) began as a Government English School and it was first housed in an attap (the processed leaves of [[nypa fruticans]]) shed known as 'Balai Kuning' which was actually used by the Sultan of Johore as a reception hall whenever he visited Muar. It was located near the site of the former High Court Building. The school was founded in 1902. It was under the charge of C.P. Frois, a [[Eurasian]] gentleman from Malacca. He was the first [[headmaster]] cum teacher of the school and the enrolment of the school then was about 40 pupils.

It was not until 1904 that the majestic [[British colonial architecture|British colonial]] style historical school building started its construction. Completed in 1915, it is still standing. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the school was used as a Japanese [[concentration camp]]. Its alumni include national and state leaders, high-ranking government officials and industrialists, such as Osman Saat, Muhyiddin Yassin, Abdul Ghani Othman, Bahar Munip, and Hussin Hj Ismail.
