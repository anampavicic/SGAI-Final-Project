'''Thiès''' ({{IPA|fr|tjɛs|}}; {{langx|ar|ثيس|Ṯyass}}; [[Noon language|Noon]]: ''Chess'') is the third largest city in [[Senegal]] with a population of 391,253 in 2023. It lies {{Convert|72|km||abbr=on}} east of [[Dakar]] on the [[N2 road (Senegal)|N2 road]] and at the junction of [[railway line]]s to [[Dakar]], [[Bamako]] and [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|St-Louis]]. It is the capital of [[Thiès Region]] and is a major industrial city.

== History ==
Before [[French conquest of Senegal|colonization]], the Thiès Plateau was a wooded frontier between the kingdoms of [[Cayor]] and [[Baol]] inhabited by the [[Serer-Noon]], an ethnic sub-group of the [[Serer people]]. The Serer-Noon still inhabit the Thiès-Nones neighborhood of the south-west city today. They speak the [[Noon language]], one of the [[Cangin languages]].

The village of Dianxene, belonging to the kingdom of Cayor, was founded on the strategically important plateau in the 17th century. In 1860, it had only 75 inhabitants. The [[France|French]] founded a military post there in 1864, becoming an important force in the city's development ever since. The [[Congregation of the Holy Spirit|Spiritans]] founded a mission there in the late 19th century to help protect the local population from raids out of [[Mauretania]] seeking to capture slaves. In 1885, the [[Dakar–Saint-Louis railway]], the first rail line in French West Africa, opened with a stop in Thiès.

The French colonial administration created the commune of Thiès in 1904. As an important railway junction, the city was an important site during the general strikes of 1945-1946 and 1947-1948. [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], later the first president of independent Senegal, was elected [[mayor]] of Thiès in November 1956.

== Transport ==
[[File:Gare ferroviaire de Thiès.jpg|thumb|left|Rail station]]
At first a simple rail stop, or "escale", on the [[Dakar-Saint-Louis railway|Dakar-Saint Louis line]] (completed in 1885) Thiès became a rail junction with the [[Dakar-Niger Railway|Dakar-Niger line]] (built 1906–1923). The national network of paved roads created after World War II likewise converged on Thiès (the [[N3 road (Senegal)|N3 road]] joins the [[N2 road (Senegal)|N2 road]] in the town), which thus commands nearly all access to the [[Cap-Vert]] [[Peninsula]] (Dakar and [[Rufisque]]).

The railways brought commercial development and migrant laborers, including [[Bambara people|Bambara]] from eastern regions of Senegal and from [[Mali]]. The rail workers of Thiès played a key role in the emergence of Senegal's [[labor movement]]. Their strikes in 1937 and again from 1947 to 1948 also marked the development of the independence movement across [[French West Africa]].

==Economy==
[[File:TRANSPORT SENEGAL USINE SENBUS 14.jpg|thumb|Senbus factory]]
Thiès is best known for its [[tapestry]]-making industry, an exclusive factory having been set up in 1966, producing work designed by Senegal's top artists. The famous Birds of Paradise tapestry was manufactured in Thiès. The city also contains a [[institute of technology|polytechnic]] school, the [[Université de Thiès|University of Thiès]]. In the 1960s, French truck manufacturer [[Berliet]] had a small assembly plant here.<ref name=PL136>{{cite journal | journal = Le poids lourd: Spécial Salon | ref = PL64 | title = Vous verrez au salon: Chez Berliet... | trans-title = What you will see at the show: at Berliet... | language = fr | page = 136 | date = October 1964 | volume = 49 | number = 592 }}</ref>

Thiès is the transportation hub of a productive agricultural hinterland, producing [[rice]], [[peanut]]s, [[manioc]], [[millet]], and [[fruit]]. The city is also a leading [[livestock]]-trading and [[meat]]-packing center. It has rail yards and repair shops, and [[aluminum phosphate]] deposits are worked at nearby [[Palo Dial]] and [[Taïba]]. The phosphate mined here is valuable as a fertiliser and is one of Senegal's largest exports.

Today, Thiès is developing increasingly as an extension of the congested Cap-Vert Peninsula. It is attracting industrial investments (electrical and mechanical engineering) and there are plans to link it to Dakar by highway and [[Commuter rail|commuter train]].

Other attractions in Thiès include a [[museum]], an artisanal and crafts village and a few remains of old [[fortification]]s.
