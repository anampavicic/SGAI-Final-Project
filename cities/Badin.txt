==History==
Badin was the site of some military action in the late 1500s, under the [[Tarkhan dynasty]] governors of [[Thatta]].<ref name="Akhtar 1983">{{cite book |last1=Akhtar |first1=Muhammad Saleem |title=Shāhjahānī of Yūsuf Mīrak (1044/1634) Sind under the Mughuls: an introduction to, translation of and commentary on the Maẓhar-i Shāhjahānī of Yūsuf Mīrak (1044/1634) |date=1983 |pages=86–7, 107, 172–3, 233–4 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/11279 |access-date=28 December 2021}}</ref> When the governor [[Mirza Baqi Muhammad Tarkhan]] died in October 1585, a dynastic power struggle broke out.<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/> His older son Mirza Payanda Muhammad, then posted at [[Siwistan]], was seen as unfit to rule, so most of the nobility initially backed his younger brother Mirza Muzaffar Muhamad, who was located in Badin.<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/> However, as Mirza Muzaffar hurried from Badin to Thatta to claim the throne, the nobles realised that they didn't want his maternal relatives, the [[Jaheja]] branch of the [[Samma (tribe)|Samma tribe]], so they instead sent for Payanda Muhammad's competent son [[Mirza Jani Beg]] to take over.<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/>{{refn|group=note|Technically only as the ''[[wakil]]'' to Payanda Muhammad, who was nominally in charge.}} Mirza Jani immediately had many of Baqi Muhammad's favourites brutally executed, which terrified Mirza Muzaffar into retreating to his power base in Badin, where he began recruiting an army to challenge his nephew.<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/> Mirza Jani then marched on Badin with an army of his own and successfully defeated his uncle, forcing him to flee to the court of [[Cutch State|Kachh]].<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/> Mirza Jani then annexed Badin into his territories.<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/> A few years later in early 1592, when Mirza Jani was in revolt against the [[Mughal Empire]], the Mughal general [[Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khanan]] sent a division to capture Badin, which they succeeded in doing.<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/>{{refn|group=note|Other divisions were also sent to [[Fathbagh]], [[Jaun, Sindh|Jaun]], [[Umarkot]], and Thatta.}}

Later, around 1614, [[Mir Abu al-Baqa']], brother of the author [[Mirak Yusuf]], was appointed ''[[jagirdar]]'' of Badin; he was recalled to the Mughal court by early 1615 to go on a military campaign against the [[Kangra Fort]].<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/> According to Mirak Yusuf, Badin belonged to the [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] of [[Chachgan]].<ref name="Akhtar 1983"/>

The old town of Badin, which was on the western bank of the Ghari Mandhar canal, was later destroyed by the [[Pathan]] Madat Khan during his raid into Sindh.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874">{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=A.W. |title=A Gazetteer of the Province of Sindh |date=1874 |publisher=George Bell and Sons |location=London |pages=117–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ap8IAAAAQAAJ |access-date=25 December 2021}}</ref> The present site, between the Ghari Mandhar and Kaziah canals, is said to have been founded around 1750 by a Hindu named Sawalo.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/>

Badin was first incorporated as a municipality in 1857.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/> Around 1874 it was described as just a fraction of its size before Madat Khan's raid, with an estimated population of 513 people.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/> The population was split about equally between Hindus and Muslims.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/> Important local industries included production of shoes, agricultural tools like [[spade]]s and axes, [[earthenware]] pottery, and wooden irrigation wheels (nars).<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/> It was a major regional trade centre for rice, [[bajri]], other cereals, [[ghee]], sugar, [[molasses]], cloth, metals, [[tobacco]], animal hides, cotton, [[liquor]], and drugs.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/> Long-distance trade was more restricted and consisted mainly of cloth, bajri, [[juar]], and oil.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/> Badin was then the headquarters of the taluka's [[Tax collector|mukhtiarkar]] and had a [[Court|kacheri]] and jail with police lines (with a force of 3 officers and 11 constables), a district bungalow, and a [[dharamshala (type of building)|dharamsala]].<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/> The town was home to several important [[pir (Sufism)|pir]]s; the most important of them, Bhawan Shah, had died recently.<ref name="Gazetteer 1874"/>

==Climate==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2021}}
Badin has a hot [[semi arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh''), formerly a [[hot desert climate]] (Koppen: BWh). The climate of the district taken as a whole is moderate and is tempered by the sea breeze which blows for eight months of the year from March to October, making the hot weather somewhat cooler than for the other parts of Pakistan. During the monsoon period, the sky is cloudy and heavy rains fall, compared to the drier seasons that prevail for the rest of the year. The climate in summer is generally moist and humid. The cold weather in Badin starts from the beginning of November when a sudden change from the moist sea breeze to the dry and cold north-east wind brings about, as a natural consequence, an immediate fall in temperature.cyclones and floods are hit because of sea.
