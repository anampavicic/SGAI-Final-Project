'''Ensenada''' is a city in [[Ensenada Municipality]], [[Baja California]], situated on the [[Pacific Coast of Mexico]]. Located on [[Bahía de Todos Santos]], the city had a population of 279,765 in 2018,<ref name=INEGI/> making it the [[List of cities in Baja California|third-largest city in Baja California]]. The city is an important international trade center and home to the [[Port of Ensenada]], the second-busiest port in Mexico. Ensenada is a major tourist destination, owing to its warm climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, and is commonly known as ''La Cenicienta del Pacífico'' ("The [[Cinderella]] of the Pacific").<ref>{{cite web|title=Ensenada: So Much To Do |url=http://www.enjoyensenada.com/english/aboutensenada.jsp |access-date=March 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220030753/http://www.enjoyensenada.com/english/aboutensenada.jsp |archive-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

Ensenada was founded in 1882, when the small community of Rancho Ensenada de Santos was made the regional capital for the northern partition of the [[Baja California Territory]]. The city grew significantly with the proliferation of mines in the surrounding mountains. While the [[Mexican Revolution]] curtailed much of Ensenada's expansion, the onset of [[Prohibition in the United States]] transformed the city into a popular tourist destination for Americans seeking entertainment and alcohol. Ensenada's reputation as a [[resort town]] was cemented by the 1950s and 1960s, which saw a construction boom and the city's rise in international prominence outside of [[North America]].

Today, Ensenada is a major economic and cultural hub for Baja California. The city is home to numerous universities, like the [[Ensenada Institute of Technology]] and the [[Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada]]. Ensenada is an important [[biotechnology]] hub and is home to numerous research institutions, like the [[Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education|Ensenada Center for Scientific Research]]. The city is a member of the [[UNESCO Creative Cities Network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/events/47-cities-join-unesco-creative-cities-network|title=47 cities join the UNESCO Creative Cities Network - Creative Cities Network |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref>

[[File:Hotel Playa de Ensenada, now Hotel Riviera del Pacifico.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hotel Riviera del Pacífico]] in 1930]]
At the time the first European explorers arrived in the region, [[Yuman–Cochimí languages|Yuman–Cochimí speaking]] peoples inhabited the region. Groups such as the [[Kiliwa people|Kiliwa]], [[Paipai people|Paipai]] and [[Kumeyaay]] still exist. These [[hunter-gatherer]] indigenous peoples lived in the bay area and interior valleys of the [[Sierra de Juárez]] and [[Sierra de San Pedro Mártir]]. The Kumeyaay had a village where the city is seated that was called Pa-tai.<ref>{{Cite web|title=bajacalifology.org - Kumeyaay Place Names|url=https://www.sandiegoarchaeology.org/Laylander/Baja/places.kumeyaay1.htm|access-date=2020-09-02|website=www.sandiegoarchaeology.org}}</ref>

[[Bahía de Todos Santos]], which Ensenada now borders, was first reached by sea by the Spanish explorer [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] on the vessels ''El Salvador'' and ''Victoria''. The city was founded on September 17, 1542, under the name ''San Mateo''.<ref name="history">{{cite web |title=History - About Ensenada |url=http://www.bajacal.com/ensenada-mexico/history.html |publisher=Baja California Language College |access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=History of Ensenada |url=http://www.mybajaguide.com/eng/destinations-history.php?id=2 |publisher=MyBajaGuide |access-date=May 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615220111/http://www.mybajaguide.com/eng/destinations-history.php?id=2 |archive-date=June 15, 2011 }}</ref> In 1602, while mapping the coast of [[the Californias]] in search of safe harbors for returning Spanish [[galleon]]s from [[Manila]] to [[Acapulco]], [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] renamed the city to ''Ensenada de Todos Santos''.<ref name="history"/> ''Ensenada'' means "bay" or "cove".<ref>[https://dle.rae.es/ensenado#Fcxuv3S Real Academia Española]: ''Parte de mar que entra en la tierra.'' (Part of the sea that enters into the land.)</ref>

The first permanent settlement was established by the [[Jesuits]] during the 17th or 18th century. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] took over the representation of Europe in what is now Ensenada. In 1805, [[José Manuel Ruiz Carillo]] obtained permission to establish himself in Ensenada, being appointed governor of Baja California and building in Ensenada a house that survived until the final part of that century, despite being briefly taken by [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], the self-declared "president" of the [[Republic of Baja California]], in 1853–54.<ref name="ensenada.gob.mx">Francisco Alberto Nuñez Tapia, "Historia Mínima de Ensenada," [http://www.ensenada.gob.mx/index.php?seccion=historiadeensenada ensenada.gob.mx]</ref>
[[File:Fachada del Templo del Purísimo Corazón de María.JPG|thumb|upright|Purísimo Corazón de María Church was built at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.]]
In 1882, Ensenada was designated the capital of Baja California, and attempts at developing the area were made by the English [[Mexican Land and Colonization Company]]. These were interrupted by the [[Mexican Revolution]], which left the area devastated. In 1915, the capital was transferred to [[Mexicali]], and in 1930, the population of Ensenada was only 5,000.<ref name="ReferenceA">Maria Eugenia Bonifaz de Novelo, "The Hotel Riviera del Pacífico," San Diego Historical Society Quarterly Spring 1983</ref> During the early part of the twentieth century, the city's name was shortened from ''Ensenada de Todos Santos'' to ''Ensenada'', a change made in order to avoid confusion with [[Todos Santos, Baja California Sur|Todos Santos]] in [[Baja California Sur]].<ref name="ensenada.gob.mx"/>
[[File:Grúas y astilleros - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Port of Ensenada]], built in 1994, is one the busiest ports on the [[West Coast of North America|Pacific Coast of North America]].]]
The twentieth-century development of Ensenada was assisted by [[prohibition]], which sent [[Americans]] and [[Canadians]] south of their border in search of [[entertainment]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], developing first [[Tijuana]], then [[Rosarito]], and finally Ensenada as tourist destinations. The [[Hotel Riviera del Pacífico]] was opened in 1930, briefly placing Ensenada on the international glamor map and was visited several times by [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|President Miguel Alemán Valdés]], international artists and political personalities.

Ensenada truly began to flourish in the early 1950s, at which time the city's population had risen to 20,000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}} The hotel finally closed in 1964. It was later reopened as a [[cultural center]] and [[museum]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> By this time, other hotels had opened, and the population and economy of Ensenada had grown and diversified towards their present status.

On January 26, 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] created the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ensenada]] with territory taken from the Archdiocese of Tijuana and Mexicali Diocese, making it a [[suffragan diocese]] of the Metropolitan Church of Tijuana.{{citation needed|date = April 2015}}

In 2023, ten people [[Ensenada shootout|were killed in a shootout]].

==Geography==
[[File:Coastline north of Ensenada - panoramio - Alistair Cunningham.jpg|thumb|right|Ensenada's [[Pacific Coast of Mexico|Pacific Coast]]]]
Many of the terrestrial or marine species inhabiting the surrounding the Greater Ensenada area in the Baja California islands are unique. [[Guadalupe Island]], off the coast of the city, is one of the best places in the world for observing the [[great white shark]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The island has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1975.

The city's offshore is host to an array of [[aquatic mammals]] including the [[gray whale]], the [[northern elephant seal]], the [[Guadalupe fur seal]] and [[California sea lion]]; terrestrial mammals include various squirrel species, [[otter]]s, the [[ring-tailed cat]], [[coyote]], [[bobcat]], and [[Cougar|puma]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Bird]] species include [[hawk]]s, [[pelican]]s, [[roadrunner]]s, and various [[waterfowl]] and oceangoing species.

Fish include [[tilapia]], [[rainbow trout]], [[leopard shark]], and the [[great white shark]].

There are no rivers in the city, only [[surface runoff]] streams that flow when there have been large amounts of rainfall.

Ensenada has one natural fresh water body, the Lagunita pond, located to the north of El Ciprés military air field, and which has ecological importance.<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Lagunita: patrimonio natural - El Vigía|url=https://www.elvigia.net/general/2017/2/2/lagunita-patrimonio-natural-262857.html|access-date=2020-06-07|website=www.elvigia.net|language=es}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Ensenada 0272 (85734850) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|280px|Panoramic view of Ensenada]]
The average rainfall is {{convert|280|mm}} per year,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} falling mainly in the winter months. Ensenada has a mild [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''[[BSk]]''), much like the rest of northwestern Baja California.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J. Grieser |author3=C. Beck |author4=B. Rudolf |author5=F. Rubel | title =World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated| journal =Meteorol.

On the other hand, the warmer months from June to September are the driest, and during this time maintain an average temperature of {{convert|21|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

For Ensenada's warm summer coastal location, the city's climate is greatly affected by the offshore cold [[California Current]]. Due to the current, the late summer and early fall seasons are typically the warmest periods for the city. [[Santa Ana winds]] – observed in much of [[Southern California]] as well – are responsible for temperature rises at any time of the year. During Santa Anas, wind direction changes and brings warm air from the interior to the coast. Snowfall is rare with the last recent one in January 2007, when the hills south of the city received small amounts of snowfall.

Similar to the [[South Coast (California)|South Coast]] of [[California]], Ensenada experiences the periodic May Gray and [[June Gloom]] [[marine layer]] effects.

{{see also|Ensenada Municipality#Government}}
[[File:Facade of Cultural Center - Former Hotel Riviera - Ensenada, BC - Mexico (6778846050).jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Riviera del Pacífico|Riviera del Pacífico Cultural Center]].]]
Ensenada is the municipal seat of the [[Ensenada Municipality]]. The city is made up of the boroughs of Ensenada and Chapultepec.

The city is administered by a city council. Port lands are administered by the Port Authority of Ensenada.

Ensenada is covered by the [[Third Federal Electoral District of Baja California]], which elects 1 member to the federal [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]].

;Public utilities
The [[Emilio López Zamora dam]] was built in 1976 by the federal government, with the objective of controlling overflow and supporting the water supply of the city.

On June 10, 2018, a desalination plant with a capacity of {{cvt|250|L}} per second started operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Planta-desaladora-de-Ensenada-entra-en-operacion-20180611-0161.html|title=Planta desaladora de Ensenada entra en operación|access-date=2020-06-07|last=Redacción|website=El Economista}}</ref>

==Economy==

===Tourism===
[[File:Baja Ha-Ha Cruiser's Rally (4047210833).jpg|thumb|left|The ''Baja Ha-Ha'' boat race in the [[Bahía de Todos Santos]].]]
Ensenada is located some {{convert|108|km}} south of the border with the United States, connected via a four-lane toll road [[Mexico 1 highway|MX-1D]] and a two lane free road, which makes it a natural destination for tourists on short vacations by car. Ensenada's proximity to [[California]] also makes it a destination for short [[cruise ship]] trips from [[Port of Los Angeles]] and [[Port of Long Beach]]. As of 2005, four cruise lines maintained ships that docked in Ensenada weekly, though, one of these ships—the ''[[Monarch of the Seas]]'', operated by [[Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines]]—ceased operations in the Pacific in mid-October 2008. The world-renowned [[Baja 1000]] off-road race is held in Ensenada every year in late November, while the [[Baja 500]] race is held in early June. Off-road enthusiasts use Ensenada year-round as a starting point to explore Baja California.
[[File:Cruiseport Village, Bahia Ensenada, Ensenada, B.C., Mexico - panoramio (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|View of Malecón de Ensenada from [[Port of Ensenada]] on the [[Pacific Ocean]].]]
Watersports and ocean proximity have formed an integral part of the structure of tourism and its relation to economics in the city. Ensenada and coastal beach towns of Greater Ensenada have several renowned [[surfing]] spots, such as San Miguel Beach, California Trailer Park, Stacks and 3 M's (''Tres Emes'' in Spanish), which are located on the north coast of the city. [[Todos Santos Island]] is a small island located west of Ensenada (about two hours by boat) and a world-famous surfing spot. A number of surfing contests, such as the [[Billabong XXL]]. have been held at Todos Santos Island. Wave faces can reach above {{convert|60|ft|order=flip}}{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} on the island and in December 2006 [[Brad Gerlach]], 2006 winner of Big XXL, surfed a wave of {{convert|68|ft|order=flip}}. 
Tourists also stop in the city on their way to their destinations farther south in the municipality where [[windsurfing]] spots are located.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Maritime activities associated with the city also include the global [[Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race]], billed as the world's largest international sailing event, which begins in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] and finishes in Ensenada. [[SCORE International]]'s [[Baja 1000]] and [[Baja 500]] desert races also traditionally begin and/or end in the city. [[Whale watching]] has also developed as a tourist draw in the city due to the [[gray whale]]'s annual migration from [[Alaska]] to the [[lagoons]] of [[Baja California Sur]]. Between the months of December and March, and back in the months of April and May, whales can be seen from the coast of Ensenada.
[[File:Bar Bura (21152507204).jpg|thumb|left|Bar on the Ensenada coast.]]
The nearby historical mission town of [[Guadalupe, Baja California|Guadalupe]], was revitalized from 1905 to 1910 with immigrant [[Spiritual Christians]], mostly ''Pryguny'' from the [[Caucasus]], South Russia. After WWII most moved to California to join more prosperous relatives, while many who remained intermarried with Mexicans and live in Ensenada and Tijuana. Two families remaining in the Guadalupe Valley opened museums, a cafe, and participate in wine tourism. The traditional economic activities in Guadalupe are olive and [[wine]] production. Currently, about 90% of wine production in Mexico originates in the valleys of Guadalupe and adjacent Calafia. Many local wine producers offer tours and tastings. Every year during the month of August, the beginning of wine harvest season is celebrated in the Guadalupe Valley and in the city of Ensenada with a two-week-long series of cultural and culinary events, all under the title banner of Fiestas de la Vendimia (Wine Harvest Festival). This event attracts people from all over the world.
[[File:MejorAmor.com (50670335).jpg|thumb|right|Shops on Calle Primera.]]
There is a street in Ensenada called "''La Calle Primera''" or Adolfo Lopez Mateos ("1st Street"). It's a tourism spot in Ensenada due to its many "Curios" (short for "Curiosidades"—trinkets and souvenirs) shops, restaurants, hotels, bars, and popular club. ''La Primera'' is a very busy street, filled with tourists and locals. ''La Primera'' is just one block away from ''Ventana al Mar'' ("Window to the Sea"), a [[boardwalk (entertainment district)|boardwalk]]/[[seawall]] avenue where an enormous Mexican flag is located. The [[Ensenada Carnaval]] is one of the country's largest, as thousands of people gather in the streets for six days and nights. Just south of the city on Highway 1 is located one of the largest{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Blowhole (geology)|marine geyser]]s in the world, colloquially known as ''[[La Bufadora]]'' ("The Blowhole"). La Bufadora attracts many tourists. The street leading to the viewpoint is a commercial area where a variety of authentic Mexican arts and crafts are for sale; bartering over prices with vendors is customary. There are also seafood restaurants and street vendors selling "churros" (fried pastry with cinnamon and sugar) and other delicacies.

===Research and manufacturing===
[[File:Ensenada Noche.jpg|left|thumb|View of Ensenada at night.]]
Ensenada is developing scientific research and natural science sectors, with special focus in the marine sciences sectors. Ensenada is claimed to be the city with the highest number of scientists per capita in [[Latin America]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Local Scientist Develops New Perspective on Whale Watching |date=April 4, 2011 |publisher=PV Pulse |first=Keph |last=Senett}}</ref> The [[Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education|Center of Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE)]] conducts research in Earth Sciences, Applied Physics, Oceanography, Communications and Experimental and Applied Biology. Further research is conducted on the campus of the [[Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada]] (UABC), mainly in Oceanography and education areas although there are groups in Physics, Biology, and other related sciences. The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)]] has a research campus in the city. The campus hosts the Institute of Astronomy and the Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnology (CNyN). The [[National Astronomical Observatory (Mexico)]] is located on the mountains of the [[Sierra de San Pedro Mártir|Sierra de San Pedro Martir]], south of the city.

The city is home to the largest cluster of bio-medical device companies in Mexico and is a developing center that is drawing a growing number of biotech researchers.<ref name="Biotech">{{Cite web|title=Borderless Biotech & Mexico's Emerging Life Sciences Industry |url=http://www.sandiegodialogue.org/pdfs/Borderless_Biotech.pdf |publisher=San Diego Dialogue |date=June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930092345/http://www.sandiegodialogue.org/pdfs/Borderless_Biotech.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-30 }}</ref> Unique to the city is that its biotech cluster is near that of another, larger, cluster in San Diego. The proximity of these two biotech clusters fuels their interaction.<ref name="Biotech"/>

The city is not part of any rail transport grid with which it could use to transport cargo and other materials, although there are plans to build a rail line to the United States border in the short to mid-term future that would link it to [[San Diego–Tijuana]]. Unlike the larger cities to the north, Ensenada has only six major industrial parks, compared to 26 in Mexicali and 51 in Tijuana, as its economy is more focused on tourism and technology. [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] guitars and [[Lowrance Electronics|Lowrance]] fishfinders are manufactured in Ensenada.

===Maritime industry===
[[File:Ensenada23Mai2004h12m30pm.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Port of Ensenada]] is one of the busiest deepwater ports on the [[West Coast of North America]].]]
The Port of Ensenada has a large influence on the civic economy. Ensenada is home to the only deep-water port in the state of Baja California and on the Baja California Peninsula. The port is part of standard shipping routes that directly link it with the Mexican cities of [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mazatlán]], [[Acapulco]] and [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]]; the [[United States|American]] cities of [[San Diego]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Los Angeles]]; the [[Guatemala]]n city of [[Puerto Quetzal]], the [[Chile]]an city of [[Valparaíso]], the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Yokohama]], and the city of [[Hong Kong]]. Ensenada is where the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] standard series guitars and basses are produced.

In addition to revenue generated by docking cruise ships, fishing accounts for a large part of the economy. More than 90 species of fish are commercially fished in Ensenada; the most important fisheries are [[tuna]], [[shrimp]], [[California spiny lobster]], [[abalone]], [[sea urchin]], [[sardine]], [[mackerel]] and [[seaweed]]. A large percentage of all catches are exported to East Asia. A tuna embargo imposed on Mexico during the 1990s caused most of the fishing fleet to relocate to the ports of [[Guaymas, Sonora|Guaymas]], and [[Mazatlán, Sinaloa|Mazatlán]], further south. To survive, Ensenada's tuna industry has shifted its focus to tuna farming, exporting the highly valued meat almost exclusively to Japan. Ensenada has been known for sports fishing over 50 years. Each year hundreds of anglers head for Ensenada to go fishing and take advantage of the shorter distances needed to travel by sea to get to the big catch.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Valle de Guadalupe.jpg|thumb|left|The nearby [[Valle de Guadalupe]] is a major [[wine tourism]] destination.]]
The municipality of Ensenada has three main agricultural zones: the Guadalupe-Calafia valleys to the north, the Ojos Negros valley to the east and the San Quintin valley to the south. The main crops are [[grape]]s, [[olive]]s, [[tomato]], [[wheat]], [[alfalfa]], [[asparagus]], [[scallion|green onions]] and [[broccoli]].

===Mining===
One of the earliest activities in the Ensenada region was gold and silver mining, and some of these mines remain in limited operation. In recent years, very large amounts of gravel have been extracted from creek beds in rural areas and exported for infrastructure works in California in the US. However, this has been a controversial activity, as environmentalists have argued that depleting the creekbeds will decrease the amount of water that is absorbed by the soil during the brief rainy season, negatively impacting the agriculture. As of November 2005, the extraction of gravel remains unchecked. Said extraction activities have been linked to former governor [[Ernesto Ruffo]].

==Education==

Ensenada's diversity as a city is in part attributed to Spanish, [[Russians|Russian]], and American influences. Spanish missionaries and [[Russians|Russian]] settlers began the growth of the wine industry in the city.<ref>{{cite news |title=Baja Guide - Explore Ensenada |url=http://web.signonsandiego.com/bajaguide/destinations/Ensenada.html |newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune |access-date=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320113306/http://web.signonsandiego.com/bajaguide/destinations/Ensenada.html |archive-date=March 20, 2012 }}</ref> Reminiscent of this time period are Russian museums in the city.

The city is known for its festivities and laid-back atmosphere, the city hosts many events including the Wine Harvest Festival (Fiestas de la Vendimia) and Ensenada Carnaval. The Wine Harvest Festival celebrates the wine harvest season and in the city and nearby Guadalupe Valley, a series of events takes place.

Typical food in Ensenada consists of [[fish taco]]s, which originated in the city,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} shrimp tacos, and [[ceviche]]. These dishes are usually accompanied by avocado and salsa. Another dish characteristic of the port city is [[carpaccio]]. The city's Mediterranean climate allows for the cultivation of grapes and olives, which in turn make wine and olive oil, respectively. Development of such foods complement Spanish, Italian, French, and Mexican dishes in Ensenada.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}
