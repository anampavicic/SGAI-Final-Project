'''Giridih''' is headquarters of the [[Giridih district]] of [[Jharkhand]] state, India. The city of Giridih is known for its industrial and health sectors, as well as its scenery.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} Giridih houses the [[Giridih Coalfield]] which is one of the oldest coalfields to be worked in India. Giridih is one of the six Data Processing Centres of [[National Sample Survey Organisation#Data Processing Division (DPD)|Data Processing Division (DPD)]] of [[National Sample Survey Organisation|National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)]]. Before 1972, Giridih was part of [[Hazaribagh district]].

==Etymology==
The literal meaning of ''Giridih'' is the ''land of hills and hillocks'' – ''giri'', a [[Hindi]] word, means ''hills'' and  ''dih'', another word of the local Khortha [[dialect]], means ''land of''.

==History==
Giridih district was a part of [[Kharagdiha]] estate until the late 18th century. During the British Raj Giridih became a part of Jungle Terry. After Kol Uprising in 1831, the parganas of Ramgarh, Kharagdiha, Kendi and Kunda became parts of the South-West Frontier Agency before being renamed to Hazaribag, which became the administrative headquarters. The [[Kharagdiha]] [[Rajas]] were settled as Rajas of Raj Dhanwar in 1809, and the Kharagdiha gadis were separately settled as zamindari estates. Some of the notable Kharagdiha Zamindari Estates were [[Koderma]], Gadi [[Palganj]], [[Baghochia|Ledo Gadi]], Gande Gadi, [[Ghoranji]] Gadi and [[Sirsia|Gadi Sirsia]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Hazaribagh District Gazetteer |date=3 October 2023 |publisher=The Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, Calcutta |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.13551/page/n5}}</ref> The town of Giridih was under the rule of the Khargdiha Zamindari Estate of Salimpur and the temporarily settled estate of Karharbari. 
 
Giridih district was created on 6 December 1972 by carving some parts of [[Hazaribagh district]]. In 1999 part of it became [[Bokaro district]].<ref name="Statoids">{{cite web | url = http://www.statoids.com/yin.html | title = Districts of India | access-date = 2011-10-11 | last = Law | first = Gwillim | date = 2011-09-25 | work = Statoids | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111017155710/http://www.statoids.com/yin.html | archive-date = 17 October 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> It is currently a part of the [[Red Corridor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2009/12/naxal-menace-83-districts-under.html |title=83 districts under the Security Related Expenditure Scheme |publisher=IntelliBriefs |date=2009-12-11 |access-date=2011-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027115807/http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2009/12/naxal-menace-83-districts-under.html |archive-date=27 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>
