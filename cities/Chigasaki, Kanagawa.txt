==History==
The city has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The area was largely pasture and farmland well into the [[Edo period]]. The [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]] passed through what is now Chigasaki, without a [[shukuba|post station]]. A large part of the area was the ''[[tenryō]]'' territory in [[Sagami Province]] controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] through the Edo period, though other parts were administered by small clans including the [[Ōoka clan]], which is renowned for its descendant [[Ōoka Tadasuke]]. After the start of the [[Meiji period]], the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] railway connected [[Chigasaki Station]] with [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] in 1898, which spurred the development of the area. Chigasaki village in [[Kōza District, Kanagawa|Kōza District]], Kanagawa Prefecture became Chigasaki town in 1908. In 1921, the [[Sagami Line]] railway connected Chigasaki with [[Hashimoto Station (Kanagawa)|Hashimoto]] to the north. Chigasaki became a [[Cities of Japan|city]] on October 1, 1947. On April 1, 2003, the population of Chigasaki exceeded 200,000 and it became a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased local autonomy. On October 24, 2014, Chigasaki agreed with [[Honolulu]] to establish the [[sister city]] relationship.<ref>[http://www.city.chigasaki.kanagawa.jp/_res/projects/default_project/_page_/001/002/769/cb56_specialissue.pdf Chigasaki Breeze The 56th Edition Special Issue, January 1, 2015]</ref>

==Government==
The city has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Chigasaki contributes three members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 15th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The city is largely a [[bedroom community]] for Tokyo and [[Yokohama]], and has been noted as a seaside resort community since the Meiji period. Tourism and summer leisure activities remain important to the local economy.

Companies headquartered in Chigasaki include:

* [[Autech|Autech Japan Co Ltd]]
* [[Miyata|Miyata Industrial Co Ltd]]
* Toho Titanium Corporation

==Local attractions==
[[File:Southern Beach Chigasaki01.jpg|thumb|Southern Beach Chigasaki]]

The shoreline from Chigasaki to Kamakura is called the "[[Shōnan]] area". A popular swimming destination, Chigasaki is well known as the birthplace of Japanese [[surfing]]. A shop called "Goddess," located only about 20 meters from the shoreline, claims to be the first [[surfboard]] shop in Japan. Bicycles with metal fittings for holding surfboards are prominent in the area. A section of the beach in Chigasaki is called "Southern Beach," inspired by the [[Southern All Stars]], a famous [[J-pop]] singing group whose lead vocalist [[Keisuke Kuwata]] hails from Chigasaki. The symbol of Southern Beach is ''Eboshi-iwa'', a large hat-shaped rock that is visible from the coast.

The city is known for being the center of Japanese Hawaiian culture with many tropical and Hawaiian stores located mainly in the southern side of the town. Fridays in Chigasaki was called "Aloha Friday" in which consumers were able to have discounts in many stores and taxis. Salesclerks and city officers are encouraged to work wearing [[aloha shirts]] as a part of [[Cool Biz campaign]] to promote its Hawaiian culture every summer since 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.chigasaki.kanagawa.jp/sangyo/1007031.html |script-title=ja:アロハビズ×茅ヶ崎市 |trans-title=Aloha Biz by Chigasaki-city |language=ja  |publisher=Chigasaki City Government}}</ref>

In contrast to the popularity as a modernized resort in south, north part of the city still retains some historical heritages. [[Ōoka Tadasuke|Ōoka Echizen]] festival is held in the family temple of the Ōoka clan ([[bodaiji]]) "Jōkenji" on May.
