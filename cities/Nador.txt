'''Nador''' ([[Arabic]]: الناظور or الناضور) is a coastal city and provincial capital in the northeastern [[Rif]] region of [[Morocco]] with a population of about 178,540 (2020 census).<ref name="hcp.ma"/>

Nador city is separated from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] by a salt lagoon named ''Rbḥar Ameẓẓyan'' in Berber (''Mar Chica'' in Spanish) and is {{convert|10|km|mi}} south of the Spanish city of [[Melilla]].

Nador was founded in the 19th century by local Berber tribes and was under Spanish occupation from 1912 until Morocco's independence in 1956.<ref name="marokko-info.nl">{{Cite web|url=https://www.marokko-info.nl/nador-city-morocco/|title=Nador, City in Morocco - Information and What to do}}</ref>

The [[Nador Province]] has over 600,000 inhabitants, predominantly of [[Riffian people|Rif]]-[[Berbers|Berber]] ethnicity. Nador is considered the second largest city in the Oriental East after [[Oujda|Wejda]].

[[File:Nador hotel RIF.jpg|thumbnail|[[Mercure (hotel)|Mercure]] hotel in downtown Nador]]

== Etymology ==
The city name originated from the Arabic word Nekor إمارة بني صالح which comes from the [[Emirate of Nekor]].

== Overview ==

The economy of Nador and Nador province includes [[fishery]], [[agriculture]], some light and heavy industry.<ref>{{cite book|title=Morocco|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] Eyewitness Travel Guides|year=2006}}</ref>

In the summer months of June to August thousands of people originating from the Nador area and living in Europe return to the city. The total of these annual visitors may exceed 25,000. They mainly stay with relatives or in rented or owned apartments, rather than staying in Nador's hotels.

The location of the city on the Mediterranean coast and proximity of the Spanish town Melilla mean there is significant international trade, particularly evident in the widespread sale of Spanish manufactured foodstuffs and household goods in Nador.

Nador was infamous as a centre of smuggling cheap Spanish and Chinese duty-free goods. Currently the smuggling has declined but it still alive competing with a smuggling stream from Algeria. Many used consumer goods from Europe and China find their way to Morocco and Africa via Melilla and Nador, both legally and illegally. The goods range from conserved food, clothes, shoes, electric home appliances, up to sophisticated hardware.<ref>Info about [http://www.answers.com/topic/nador?cat=travel Nador and Smuggling] visited on 6 May 2008</ref>

== Economy ==

The main two economic industries here are fishing and agriculture. Other types of industrial income are generated from textiles, chemicals, and numerous metallurgical industries. Recently, tourism has also become an important factor for the economy.<ref>Oxford Business Group (2007). ''Oxford Business Group''. Page 202. {{ISBN|9781902339764}}.</ref>

Most tourists come from other Moroccan cities,<ref>Oxford Business Group (2011). ''Oxford Business Group''. Page 123. {{ISBN|9781907065309}}.</ref> but Nador has also an increasing number of European visitors, some through the international ferry connections to Spain and France.<ref name="Searight, Susan 1999 Page 271">Searight, Susan (1999).

The two [[Nador railway stations]] connect to the [[Rail transport in Morocco|rail network]] of the country of Morocco. The recent boost in tourism here has inspired ambitious tourism plans for the area, endorsed by [[King Mohammed VI]].<ref>Jacobs, Daniel and Keith Drew (2013). ''The Rough Guide to Morocco''. Penguin. Section: Nador. {{ISBN|9781409332671}}.</ref> With its avenues, palm-lined boulevards and brand new marina, hotels, cafés, banks, shops and restaurants press on to make it suitable for the fast-growing tourism industry.<ref name="Warson, Lucilla 2015 Page 162"/><ref name="Clammer, Paul 2014 Page 221"/>

Nador has experienced a dramatic economic growth in recent years, fueled by traditional industries, such as [[metallurgy]], and by modern ones, i.e. electronics, chemicals, and textiles. Older industries as fishing and agriculture are still the most important income for Nadoris. [[Beni Enzar]], on the edge of Nador, is home to [[Nador Port]], which is one of the most crucial fishing ports on the Mediterranean coast. Nador Port also has modern naval dockyards.<ref name="Warson, Lucilla 2015 Page 162"/> Nador's farm land is extremely fertile,<ref>(in German) Kohlbach, Edith (2008). ''Ostmarokko''. Edith-Kohlbach-Reisebücher. Page 36. {{ISBN|9783941015005}}.</ref> and the main agricultural resources are fruits, citrus, and wine-grapes.<ref name="Searight, Susan 1999 Page 271"/>

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Motocross in the Boqqana of Nador.jpg|thumb|Motocross on the beach]]
During the summer months, Nador is visited by tens of thousands of Moroccan migrants living in Europe, who are originally from the province or from the city of Nador itself. These summer visitors contribute strongly to the development of the city.

Until early 2008 the city end of the boulevard was formed by the Rif Hotel, but in the spring of 2008 the existing hotel was demolished and the road alongside the boulevard opened and extended. This new road by-passes the city centre and runs directly towards the main roundabout at the entrance of Nador via the road to Tawima. The remaining grounds where the hotel and its facilities were located are being redeveloped into a new hotel complex: after some delay the new development is being built under supervision of Khalid El Adouli.<ref>Profile of [http://ma.viadeo.com/fr/profile/khalid.el-adouli Khalid El-Adouli], managing architect of the new Rif hotel development. Visited: 7 September 2012</ref> The new Rif complex is being built on the grounds of the former hotel minus the strip of land directly on the coast, as this is now a road and a public boulevard on reclaimed land.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The new hotel will target the high-end tourism market and also cater for business users with congress-facilities. Once re-opened it will offer a discothèque (serving alcoholic beverages) and meeting or party rooms. The hotel itself will offer 110 four-star rooms, including ten suites and also 76 apartment rooms. The budget for the redevelopment of the hotel is 356 million dirham and the total usable floorspace will be {{cvt|30,000|m2}}.<ref name="rkempo">Information on hotel redevelopment from [https://archive.today/20130222160729/http://www.rkempo.nl/forums/nador-driouch/2242-nador-hotel-rif-hotel.html RKempo Community site], visited 7 September 2012</ref>

Just outside Nador a new [[ecology|ecological]] resort, ''Abdouna Trifa'', is being developed, including holiday homes, a golf course and a marina. The total size of the new resort consists of {{cvt|720,000|m2|acre}} built area on a terrain of {{cvt|480|ha}}. This ten-year development plan was started in 2008 by Mohammed VI, the king of Morocco.<ref>Press-release of CGI about [http://www.cgi.ma/upload/communiques/document1.pdf Start of development Abdouna Trifa]{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (French), 15 July 2008.
