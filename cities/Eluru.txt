The history of Eluru dates back to the second century CE and has great prominence in the history of Andhra. Vengi near Eluru was the capital of Andhra from the second century to the twelfth century, ruled by [[Salankayanas]], Vishnukudinas, and [[Eastern Chalukyas]]. Vengi was the capital city of Andhradesa for more years than any other city in Andhra Pradesh.

The Salankayanas ruled from the third to the fifth century CE, with their domain centred around the Vengi region and Eluru serving as their capital.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vijayawada-set-to-regain-pre-eminence-as-Andhra-Pradeshs-capital/articleshow/41712040.cms|title=Vijayawada set to regain pre-eminence as Andhra Pradesh's capital|website=[[The Times of India]] |date=4 September 2014 |access-date=15 May 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111201002/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vijayawada-set-to-regain-pre-eminence-as-Andhra-Pradeshs-capital/articleshow/41712040.cms|archive-date=11 November 2020}}</ref> Known as Šalaňkayana after their Gotra name, they were feudatories of the Ikshvakus.

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Andhra Pradesh deu.png|thumb|Map of Andhra Pradesh prior to Independence]]

In the early 17th century, the [[East India Company]] was establishing its foothold in the Indian subcontinent amidst the complex political landscape of the Mughal Empire. In 1689, after Mughal forces occupied the [[Visakhapatnam|Vizagapatam factory]] and seized Company servants, the renewal of the factory's lease was secured, including for Eluru. The President of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] informed the Governors of Eluru and other factories about the reconciliation with the Mughals. Due to threats from local bandits, the Company requested permission to fortify the Vizagapatam factory, which [[Asad Khan (Mughal noble)|Nawab Asad Khan]] granted in April 1689.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Vittalrao |first=Y |date=1959 |title=East India Company and Andhra |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44304320 |journal=Indian History Congress |volume=22 |pages=347 |jstor=44304320 }}</ref>

In 1724, the region was integrated into the Nizam of Hyderabad's dominion. In 1748 AD, [[Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I|Nizam-ul-Mulk]] passed away, leading to a succession dispute between his son [[Nasir Jung]] and his grandson [[Muzaffar Jang Hidayat|Muzaffar Jung]]. Both, however, were ultimately overthrown due to the machinations of their subordinates. As a result, [[Salabat Jung]], the third son of Nizam-ul-Mulk, was elevated to the throne with the support of the French. Between 1750 and 1850, the Northern Coromandel region, including Eluru, witnessed significant political and administrative changes. In 1753 AD, Salabat Jung granted the provinces of Kondapalle, Eluru, Rajahmundry, and Chicacole to the [[French East India Company]] as a means to maintain their military forces.{{sfn|Ramesan|1979|p=40}} In the mid-18th century, the power struggle between the [[French India|French]] and British East India Companies significantly impacted the region around Eluru. By December 1758, during the [[Carnatic wars]], British forces under [[Francis Forde (East India Company officer)|Lieutenant Colonel Forde]] began a series of military operations in the Northern Circars, including the area around Eluru. This was part of a broader strategy to weaken the French position in the Deccan and support local allies.
On October 20, 1758, British troops arrived at Visakhapatnam, subsequently advancing to Eluru.{{sfn|Goel|Pande|Madhavi |Parveen|2023|p=103}} By February 6, 1759, British forces reached Eluru, and by March 3, they neared [[Machilipatnam|Masulipatnam]]. The French commander, Conflaus, had sought assistance from the Nizam of Hyderabad, Salabat Jung, but British pressure led to the eventual surrender of Masulipatnam on April 8, 1759. Salabat Jung, the Nizam of Hyderabad, initially allied with the French but was forced to retreat after a treaty with the British, after the rebellion by his brother, [[Nizam Ali Khan, Asaf Jah II|Nizam Ali Khan]].{{sfn|Goel|Pande|Madhavi |Parveen|2023|p=104}} In 1760, Nizam Ali Khan sought British assistance in his conflict with the [[Maratha Confederacy|Marathas]], offering the cession of Eluru and two other Circars. Although the British couldn't spare troops, they suggested to Hasan Ali Khan, the fauzdar of Eluru, to lease the five Northern Circars to them in return for half the net revenue. In 1762, Nizam Ali Khan ousted Salabat Jung and usurped the throne, leading to the British occupying the Circars, including Eluru, under the sanads delivered by Hasan Ali Khan. When Nizam Ali Khan demanded the return of the sanads and the restoration of the territory, he appointed Buddea Jemah Khan as the new fauzdar in 1763. However, Jemah Khan struggled to maintain authority after the withdrawal of British troops and was forced to take refuge in the fort of Eluru when the [[Vizianagaram Estate|Raja of Vizianagaram]] captured Rajahmundry. By 1766, a treaty was concluded where the British agreed to hold the Northern Circars, including Eluru, on payment of tribute and the provision of troops.{{sfn|Goel|Pande|Madhavi |Parveen|2023|p=107}} Hasan Ali Khan's administration ended with the expiration of his lease in 1769, and Eluru, along with Rajahmundry and [[Kondapalli Fort|Kondapalle]], was placed under the direct control of the British, managed by the Chief and Council at Machilipatnam. This agreement was part of a broader strategy by the British to secure their interests in the region and stabilize their position against other regional powers.{{sfn|Ramesan|1979|p=41}}

In AD 1785, disputes over estate management, including Eluru, led to unrest. During this period, Eluru's revenue management was intertwined with neighboring estates such as [[Polavaram Estate|Polavaram]], Gutala and Kothapalle. The early history of the zamindari of Eluru is not well-documented. By AD 1786, Tirapati Raju, the zamindar of [[Mogalthur]] who owns Eluru, fell behind on payments, which led to the estate being taken over by the Company. Revell was appointed to oversee the estate with assistance from Bhupayya, the zamindar's diwan, and the zamindar eventually settled his debts faithfully.{{sfn|Ramesan|1979|p=43}} In AD 1791, following the death of Tirapati Raju and an insurrection led by Jagga Raju, the Mogalthuru zamindari, including Eluru, was annexed to the Company's dominions and leased out. The renters, Bhupayya and Venkatarama Raju, failed to meet their obligations and fled, leading to further disturbances.{{sfn|Ramesan|1979|p=44}} In AD 1794, the Masulipatnam district, including Eluru, was reorganized into three collectorates with headquarters at Mogalthuru, Cocanada, and Rajahmundry ,with Eluru under Rajahmundry's jurisdiction.{{sfn|Ramesan|1979|p=45}}

During [[British Raj|British rule]], Eluru was a military station and the capital city of Northern Circars, a division of the Madras Presidency.{{sfn|Hunter|1885|p=351}} In the Madras Presidency, the District of Rajahmundry was created in 1823.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nyapathi-subbarao-carved-an-identity-for-telugus/article6094152.ece|title=Nyapathi Subbarao carved an identity for Telugus|first=B. v s|last=Bhaskar|newspaper=The Hindu |date=8 June 2014|via=www.thehindu.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210406195344/https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nyapathi-subbarao-carved-an-identity-for-telugus/article6094152.ece|archive-date=6 April 2021}}</ref> It was reorganized in 1859 and was bifurcated into Godavari and Machilipatnam districts.

Branches were established in Eluru, [[Guntur]], [[Gudivada]], and Bezawada. Initially, the party focused on organizing conferences, holding meetings for socialist propaganda, and hosting tours by national leaders like [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Satyanarayana |first=A |date=January 1986 |title=Rise and Growth of the Left Movement in Andhra, 1934-1939 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3520420 |journal=Social Scientist |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=35 |doi=10.2307/3520420 |jstor=3520420 }}</ref> Members of the All India Khadi Board visited Eluru, urging people to produce and use khaddar, which led to a significant increase in demand, causing local depots to struggle to keep up.

The Eluru Municipality passed a resolution supporting the boycott of the Commission and ordered the closure of all municipal institutions on the day they arrived in India.{{sfn|Ramesan|1979|p=46}}

During Mahatma Gandhi's individual Satyagraha in 1941, Pattabhi Sitaramaiah led the movement in Andhra. After Sitaramaiah's arrest, Venkata Raju was appointed as his successor with Gandhi's approval on March 19, 1941. Venkata Raju subsequently traveled to various Andhra towns, including Eluru, to build support for the Satyagraha. His efforts were notable in Eluru and other locations such as Guntur, Vijayawada, and Kakinada. Venkata Raju's activism continued during the [[Quit India Movement]], where he led underground efforts in [[Guntur district|Guntur District]] before his arrest in [[Tenali]] on September 3, 1942.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mohan |first=V.K. |date=1987 |title=Some Aspects of Freedom Movement in Andhra with Reference to Manthena Venkata Raju, 1941-42 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44141737 |journal=Indian History Congress |volume=48 |pages=444 |jstor=44141737 |access-date=17 August 2024 |archive-date=17 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817110639/https://www.jstor.org/stable/44141737 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Dalit Movement ===

Under the chairmanship of [[Bhagya Reddy Varma]], the First Andhra Desa Panchama Conference was held in Bezawada (Vijayawada) on November 4-6, 1917. Varma's efforts included extensive tours across Andhra Districts, with Eluru being a notable stop. His advocacy led to a significant shift in government policy. The Government of Madras, influenced by these pressures, issued G.O.No. 817 on March 25, 1922, replacing the term ''Panchama'' with ''[[Adi Hindu movement|Adi-Andhra]]'' in Andhra.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gundimeda |first=Sambaiah |date=2016 |title=Dalit Activism in Telugu Country, 1917–30 |url=https://drupal.alliance.edu.in/drupal/sites/default/files/2021-02/Dalit%20Activism%20in%20Telugu%20Country%2C%201917%E2%80%9330.pdf |journal=SAGE Publications |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=334 |via=South Asia Research |access-date=17 August 2024 |archive-date=17 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817104558/https://drupal.alliance.edu.in/drupal/sites/default/files/2021-02/Dalit%20Activism%20in%20Telugu%20Country%2C%201917%E2%80%9330.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1944, [[B. R. Ambedkar|Dr. B.R. Ambedkar]] visited Eluru during his tour of Andhra Pradesh. Ambedkar used his platform to criticize Gandhi, asserting that Gandhi's policies were unsuitable for India and likening them unfavorably to Abraham Lincoln's approach. Despite his criticism of Gandhi, Ambedkar's visit was significant for Eluru's Dalit community. His speeches inspired local untouchables, leading to increased self-consciousness and activism. Ambedkar's visit was well-received, and he was presented with Welcome Addresses by various local associations, including the Vaisya Association, Backward Classes Association, and Prema Samajam. Ambedkar's visit to Eluru and other Andhra towns, along with the government's support for the upliftment of untouchables, marked a period of significant social and political change in the region. His influence helped galvanize local leaders and activists, contributing to the broader Dalit movement in Andhra Pradesh.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gangaiah |first=K |date=2007 |title=Emergence of Dalit movements in Andhra and Dr. B.R.

=== Eluru outbreak ===

{{main|Eluru outbreak}}
On December 4, 2020, Eluru experienced an outbreak of neurological symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness. Within three days, approximately 500 people were affected. Multidisciplinary teams from [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalagiri|AIIMS, Mangalagiri]] were dispatched to investigate the outbreak.<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 August 2020 |title=Andhra Pradesh's Eluru: India experts investigate 'mystery' illness |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55227388 |access-date=18 August 2024 |language=en-GB |archive-date=19 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240819044704/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55227388 }}</ref> The team collected biological samples, including blood and urine, from 112 participants, comprising 103 cases (77 active cases and 26 recovered) and 9 controls.

Analysis revealed that [[Triazofos]], an organophosphate pesticide, was present in 74% of blood samples and its metabolites in 98% of urine samples from affected individuals. Heavy metals, including lead and mercury, were within permissible limits, and no [[mycotoxin]]s were detected in food samples. While municipal water sources were free of pesticides, household water contained Triazofos at an average concentration of 1.00 μg/L.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mummadi|first1=Mahesh Kumar|last2=Pandurangi|first2=Raghavendra|last3=Geddam|first3=J.

The investigation concluded that Triazofos pesticide contamination in household drinking water was the likely cause of the outbreak. Recommendations included enhanced surveillance for residual pesticides in soil, water, and food, as well as an intersectoral approach involving government and public health agencies to identify contamination sources. Promoting rational pesticide use and conducting educational programs were also advised to prevent future outbreaks.<ref name="TSD">{{cite news|access-date=8 December 2020|title=Heavy metal content in water caused mysterious disease in AP|url=https://www.siasat.com/heavy-metal-content-in-water-caused-mysterious-disease-in-ap-2040974/|newspaper=The Siasat Daily|date=8 December 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210217223715/https://www.siasat.com/heavy-metal-content-in-water-caused-mysterious-disease-in-ap-2040974/|archive-date=17 February 2021}}</ref>

Eluru is located in the [[Pranhita–Godavari Basin]], a rift that stretches from [[Borgaon, Madhya Pradesh|Boregaon]] in [[Maharashtra]] to the east coast of Andhra Pradesh. This region features a range of geological deposits from the [[Permian]] to [[Early Cretaceous]] periods. [[Gondwana|Lower Gondwana]] formations like Talchir and Barakar are found along the basin's edges, while Upper Gondwana sediments, including Kamthi and Kota Sandstones, are present in the central areas.

[[File:Kollerulakejanuary.jpg|thumb|Kolleru lake during Winter]]

[[Kolleru Lake]] is the largest freshwater lake situated between the major river deltas of the Godavari and Krishna along India's east coast. This shallow wetland has a depth ranging between 0.5 and 2.0 meters in summer and spans approximately 245 square kilometers. Designated as a wetland of international significance under the [[Ramsar Convention]], Kolleru serves as a flood-balancing reservoir and a crucial habitat for various resident and migratory bird species over an area of about 910 square kilometers. While the exact origin of Kolleru Lake is unclear, previous studies based on sandy beach ridges and fossil shell datings suggest it may have formed as a coastal lagoon during the Mid-Holocene period.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=A.

In August 2019, the [[National Green Tribunal|National Green Tribunal (NGT)]] mandated action plans for all non-attainment cities, including Eluru. On December 27, 2019, an action plan was submitted by the [[Environmental monitoring|Air Quality Monitoring Committee]] (AQMC) for Eluru. The [[Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board|Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB)]] has been monitoring the city's ambient air quality under the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAAQMP), focusing on parameters such as [[Particulates|PM10]], PM2.5, SO2, and NO2. Currently, air quality measurements are taken manually, as there are no real-time monitoring stations in Eluru. The city is categorized into four areas for air quality measurement: Commercial, Silent/Sensitive, Industrial, and Residential.
The data indicates a decline in PM10 levels from 2014 to 2020, reflecting a positive trend. PM10 sources in Eluru are primarily roads and vehicular emissions, with no major industries within the city. Eluru generates 79 metric tons of solid waste daily and engages in home composting, with 3 metric tons of waste processed from 173 micro pockets of dry waste sent to a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and wet waste sent to a [[vermicompost]]ing unit. The city has a single dumping site located at Ponani and operates seven Pollution Under Control (PUC) centres within its limits.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020 |title=Comprehensive Action plan for Clean air in Non-attainment cities of Andhra Pradesh |url=https://cpcb.nic.in/Actionplan/Eluru.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240818053349/https://cpcb.nic.in/Actionplan/Eluru.pdf |archive-date=18 August 2024 |access-date=18 August 2024 |website=Central Pollution Control Board |publisher=Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board |pages=3–8}}</ref>

After 1953, the hospital saw major improvements, including a new building. By the 1960s, it had 300 beds and offered various services such as surgery, general medicine, pediatrics, eye care, family planning, dental care, and obstetrics and gynecology. It also had a blood bank and a district laboratory.{{sfn|Ramesan|1979|p=205}}

=== Economic Impact of [[COVID-19]] ===

The [[COVID-19 lockdown in India|COVID-19 lockdown]] had a profound impact on the economy of Eluru. Over 51,500 workers across 23 sectors faced income loss during the lockdown. Additionally, approximately 20,000 weavers, fishermen, tailors, artisans, and self-employed individuals experienced significant disruptions to their livelihoods. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that Eluru, despite constituting only 5.5% of the district's population, reported over 40% of the district's COVID-19 cases, with 7,000 cases in the town, including 6,000 from its slums, which were particularly vulnerable.
The economic strain led many workers from the unorganised sector to turn to reselling liquor, purchased from reopened wine shops, to cope with income loss and mounting loan interests.

== Transport & Connectivity ==
{{Main|Transport in Eluru}}

[[File:Eluru bus station at night.jpg|thumb|[[Eluru New bus station]]]]
Eluru has a diverse transportation system that includes auto rickshaws, bicycles, buses, and trains. Historically, the city had struggled with traffic congestion, particularly around railway gates at [[Vatluru]], Venkatraopet, Powerpet, [[Eluru Old bus station|old bus stand]], and Eastern Locks. This issue was due to the National Highway passing through the city, leading to significant traffic delays as vehicles rushed to cross railway gates both within the city and its outskirts.<ref name="old_overbridge">{{cite news |title=Old overbridge bearing brunt of growing traffic|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/Old-overbridge-bearing-brunt-of-growing-traffic/article15905786.ece|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=The Hindu|language=en |archive-date=17 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817160810/https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/Old-overbridge-bearing-brunt-of-growing-traffic/article15905786.ece }}</ref>
In response, the government constructed a mini bypass road connecting Eastern Locks and Vatluru. Despite these efforts, traffic problems persisted, partly due to the increase in vehicle numbers using the bypass road, which was originally part of the [[Golden Quadrilateral|Golden Quadrilateral programme]] completed in the late 1990s.<ref name="traffic1"/> The traffic on this road has nearly doubled since its completion.
Efforts to manage the congestion included constructing an underbridge at Venkatraopet, a railway overbridge at the old bus stand, and replacing the footbridge at Powerpet with a new bridge.
