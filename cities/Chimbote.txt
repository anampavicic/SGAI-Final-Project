'''Chimbote'''  {{IPA|es|tʃimˈbote||Es - Chimbote.ogg}}; {{langx|qu|Chimputi}}) is the largest city in the [[Ancash Region]] and the 10th largest city in [[Peru]]. With a population of 425,367, it is the capital of both [[Santa Province]] and [[Chimbote District]]. 

The city is located on the coast in [[Ferrol Bay]], 130 [[km]] south of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and {{convert|420|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] on the [[Pan-American Highway (South America)|North Pan-American highway]]. It is the start of a chain of important cities on the [[Peru]]vian north coast like [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]] and [[Piura]]. The advantages of this geographic location made Chimbote into a transshipment junction for the [[Santa River]] [[valley]].

== Etymology ==
The [[Quechuan languages]] corresponds to the journalists José Gutiérrez and Demetrio Ramos, who in Chimbote through history (1969) refer to the verb chimbar, a Quechuism originating from "chimba", without delving into the process of formation of the word. According to the American linguist Gary Parker (1976), tsimpay means 'to cross a river' in Ancashino Quechua, and the voicing of /p/ in the vicinity of /-m/ in syllabic coda position is known for Quechua, but remains in the transformation of /a/ into "o", anomalous, like the same addition of -te, as for Guardia's report.

==History==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
The territory in which Chimbote is currently located has been successively populated by the [[Recuay culture|Recuay]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], [[Wari Empire|Wari]], [[Chimor]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] cultures. The archaeological centers of Huaca San Pedro, El Castillo, among others, testify to this. It is thought that the same ethnic group populated these lands, the Maya, but the aborigines were later dispersed and decimated when the [[Conquest of America]] occurred.

=== Colonial era ===
It is in the book Introduction and description of the provinces belonging to the Archbishopric of Lima of 1774, written by Cosme Bueno, that the name of Chimbote appears for the first time in an official document. The reference tells […] that the old Villa de Santa María de la Parrilla (Santa), has a small fishing village called Chimbote attached to it. Ethnography refers to these first settlers as fishermen from the resort of Huanchaco, west of Trujillo, which is why they were called huanchaqueros.

=== Republican era ===
In 1835, when General [[Andrés de Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]] granted Chimbote's first official acknowledgement, Chimbote was a village of [[fishermen]] with a population of no more than 800. During the Lynch expedition, an episode of the [[War of the Pacific]], Chimbote was occupied by the [[Chilean Army]], the Cambio Puente hacienda. As in the other occupations, the owner, Dionisio Derteano, was required to pay a fee so that the looting would not take place, but this was impossible, because in addition to demanding a very high amount, the Peruvian State closed the banks in order to avoid these quotas. Consequently, the enemy looted and destroyed the harvest, the mill and everything in it.
[[File:The earth and its inhabitants (1894) (14579713840).jpg|thumb|A map of the Ancash Region in 1894]]
In 1871, an agreement was made with [[Henry Meiggs]] to build a [[railroad]] towards the interior of the country. Chimbote was classified as a [[port]], even though its population remained around 1,000. The opening of the [[Pan-American Highway (South America)|Pan-American Highway]] created easy access to Lima in the 1930s. In 1881, there was an attempt to cede a naval base to the U.S. in Chimbote Bay by Peru. The deal was blocked by Chile who sent its marines to occupy Chimbote after learning of the deal to cede a naval base to the U.S. Navy.

In 1940, Chimbote was still a small [[fishing port]], with only 2,400 inhabitants in an urbanized area of {{convert|80|ha|km2 sqmi|sp=us|abbr=out}}. In 1943, the government created the [[Corporación Peruana del Santa]] (Peruvian Corporation of Santa). This entity assumed ownership of the [[railroad]], made improvements to the [[port]], and began work on a [[hydroelectric power station]] on the Río Santa (in the [[Cañón del Pato]] <nowiki>[Duck Canyon]</nowiki> in [[Huallanca District, Bolognesi|Huallanca]]). The first stage of the power station was inaugurated in 1958; also that year, an iron and steel plant was built.<ref group="nb">The iron and steel plant is currently{{When|date=September 2010}} known as Empresa Siderúrgica del Perú S.A.A.</ref> By 1943, the first companies dedicated to the extraction of liver from the [[Sarda chiliensis|Pacific bonito]] fish arrived. This liver was sold for a high price abroad due to World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II.

In the 1950s, port activity was consolidated with the constitution of the Peruvian Corporation of Santa, the construction of the Cañón de Pato hydroelectric plant and the beginning of steel activities. Around that time there were already some fish processing plants on the outskirts of the city. However, it was only in the 1960s that massive exploitation began, largely at the initiative of Luis Banchero Rossi, beginning the disorderly migratory exodus due to the high demand for labor. This growth also implied the arrival of services that made the growth of the city chaotic and disproportionate to plans.

The following decade would see the decline of the economy due to two factors: overfishing and environmental pollution, a product of the industry that depleted the schools of the coast, and climatic factors such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] phenomenon. Also in the year 1970, the bitter [[1970 Ancash earthquake]] occurred, which reduced much of the city's infrastructure and real estate to rubble, not counting the numerous deaths in Chimbote and the rest of the department; A big problem was already coming to Chimbote.

=== Present ===
The last few decades have been one of reorganization and ordering in process for Chimbote. After the collapse of the fishing industry and a new strong El Niño around 1983, interests were turned to agribusiness, tourism and commerce. In recent years, efforts have been made to recover the bay and remodel several buildings and public places.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
[[Image:Satellite photo of Chimbote Peru.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Satellite image of Chimbote]]
Chimbote's climate is comfortable, despite being located in the tropics and in a desert. Although classified as subtropical, Chimbote's proximity to the cool [[Humboldt current]] leads to temperatures much cooler than those expected for a tropical desert, and is classified as a [[desert climate]]. On average, the warmest month is February with temperatures a little over {{convert|26|°C|°F|0}}. September is considered the average coolest month, at around {{convert|13|°C|°F|0}}. The annual average temperature is around 20&nbsp;°C (68&nbsp;°F).

The city gets little to no precipitation; however, thick fog predominates through the months of May to November, usually overnight. Rainfall usually comes in February.

==Population==
A large number of people migrated to Chimbote in the early 1970s. By that time, less than 5 percent of the people from Chimbote would truly consider themselves native; between 1960 and 1970, Chimbote's population multiplied by more than a hundred times. In 1900, the population of the port was 1,400; after 1970, it was 170,000. As of 2005, its population was 324,398.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Peru-Chimbote.html|title=Peru – Chimbote Agglomeration|work=citypopulation.de|last=Brinkhoff|first=Thomas|date=20 April 2007|access-date=6 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702015740/http://www.citypopulation.de/Peru-Chimbote.html|archive-date=2 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The influx of residents was closely bound to the creation of the Corporación Peruana del Santa, to the start and development of the [[fishing]] industry, and to the establishment of the iron and steel plant ("[[SIDERPERU|Siderperu]]"). Together, these multiplied the commercial and productive activities of the port. At the beginning of 1996, as [[Peru]]vian public companies were privatized, the Peruvian-Brazilian company Acerco bought Siderperu.

===Districts and neighborhoods===
The city of Chimbote, being a district itself, comprises 7 more districts: Santa, Coishco, Samanco, Nepeña, Macate, Moro, Cáceres del Perú, and Nuevo Chimbote. The neighborhoods of El Barrio de Acero, Barrio Bolivar, El Progreso, Laderas del norte alto and laderas del norte bajo, Miraflores Alto and Miraflores Bajo surround Chimbote.

==Economy==
[[File:Captador de Emisiones.jpg|thumb|SIDERPERU factory]]
During the 1970s, the [[El Niño]] climate pattern, an [[earthquake]], and overfishing drastically affected the fishing industry, and restrictions were imposed to ensure its survival. More than 75 percent of Peru's fishing industry is based in Chimbote.

Chimbote is the largest fishing port in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pew.org/22Hubwh|title=New Analysis Identifies World's Largest and Busiest Fishing Ports|website=pew.org|date=5 January 2016 }}</ref> Chimbote has more than 30 fish factories. One of the companies in Chimbote that stands out the most is the steel company [[SIDERPERU]], it is the first steel company in Peru. Produces and markets high quality steel products, intended for the construction, mining and industrial sectors; both in the local and foreign markets. It has been part of Gerdau since 2006, a leader in the production of long steel on the American Continent.

Chimbote also has beaches that support tourism.
[[File:Fishing day in the Chimbote bay.jpg|thumb|Fishers off the coast of Chimbote]]

===Peruvian anchoveta "boom"===

Shortly after the fish [[canning industry]] declined, the industrialization of [[Peruvian anchoveta|anchoveta]] fishing peaked. This attracted people from all over Peru, due to the high wages paid in the fishing industry at the time, fueling Chimbote's suburban growth. The strong migratory wave toward the city increased because of the serious crisis of the countryside in the 1960s, particularly in [[Ancash]], [[Cajamarca]] and the northern part of [[La Libertad Region]]. The axis of development moved from the [[Gossypium barbadense|Pima cotton]], [[sugarcane]], and [[rice]] plantations to the large city. In addition, Chimbote was a natural exit [[Channel (geography)|channel]] for the exports of the [[Santa Province|Santa valley]], and a starting point for the entry to the [[Callejón de Huaylas]].

The Peruvian anchoveta [[Boom and bust|boom]] created wealth in the city, but it soon ended due to indiscriminate [[fishing]] that overwhelmed the [[bio-mass]]. An [[earthquake]] in 1970 damaged to the facilities of the [[Fishing industry|fishing industries]], causing [[unemployment]] and [[Poverty|impoverishment]]. During this period, the [[Diocese of Chimbote]] created the Social Welfare Commission, to organize diverse popular dining places in conjunction with [[UNICEF]].{{Vague|date=September 2010}} Since the 1960s, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh]] has served the poor at the Chimbote Mission, raising funds through the Chimbote Foundation.<ref name="Chimbote Foundation">{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/valleyindependent/news/s_192679.html|title=Local school children provide help for counterparts in Peru|last=Lelik|first=Emma Jene|date=5 May 2004|work=The Valley Independent|publisher=The Tribune-Review Publishing Company|page=1|access-date=17 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502013106/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/valleyindependent/news/s_192679.html|archive-date=2 May 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Tourism ==
Chimbote is surrounded by two natural bays, the Bay of Chimbote (or Ferrol) and the Bay of Samanco, both with excellent [[harbor]] conditions. Chimbote forms a [[conurbation]] with [[Nuevo Chimbote District]] to the south. Between these districts, the Humedales de Villa María, a [[swamp]], is home to a local species of [[heron]], along with many species of [[frog]]s and fish. The swamp is formed by the [[Lacramarca River]].

To the south of the city, there are many beaches, such as [[Besique|Vesique]], [[Los Chimús (beach)|Los Chimús]], [[Tortugas beach|Tortugas]], [[Caleta Colorada]] and [[El Dorado beach|el Dorado]]. Also located near Chimbote is the [[Blanca Island|Isla Blanca]] (''white isle'', in English), which takes its name from the white color of the ground. Isla Blanca measures approximately {{convert|3200|m|ft|sp=us}} in length and {{convert|920|m|ft|sp=us}} in width, and reaches {{convert|204|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level.

Located next to the city is the Cerro de la Juventud (Mountain of Youth), also called Cerro de la Paz (Mountain of Peace). Since 1985, this tourist attraction attracts hundreds annually. Visitors appreciate a panoramic view of Chimbote's bay from the top of this mountain. Tourists can also visit Isla Blanca Boulevard, which has many beautiful marble sculptures and fountains.

=== Food ===
The first substratum of the Chimbotana culture was that of the fishing towns of the north coast, influenced in the past by the [[Moche culture|Moche]] and [[Chimor]] and later by the West through Spanish culture. During the steel and fishing boom, the great migration produced the adhesion of diverse cultural patterns from both the coast and the mountains of the country. As a result, city is known for its ''[[ceviche]]'', a popular Peruvian dish whose ingredients include [[whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], [[octopus]], [[seashell]], [[squid]], [[crab]], and [[Capsicum annuum|red hot pepper]]. It is very abundant in the city, due to its proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and surplus of fish. Seafood is the most popular food category in Chimbote. Another popular dish is spicy guinea pig, or in folk dance, marinera is as popular as huaino and other arts.

=== Festivals ===
Chimbote has two important celebrations during the year: Holy Week and The Festivity of ''San Pedrito of Chimbote'' (also called ''Chimbote's Civic Anniversary'').
