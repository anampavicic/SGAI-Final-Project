It is located on the [[Niger River]], near the rapids that divide the upper and middle Niger valleys in the southwestern part of the country. 

Bamako is the nation's administrative center. The city proper is a [[Cercles of Mali|cercle]] in its own right. Bamako's [[Inland port|river port]] is located in nearby [[Koulikoro]], along with a major regional trade and conference center. Bamako is the seventh-largest [[West Africa|West African]] urban center after [[Lagos]], [[Abidjan]], [[Kano (city)|Kano]], [[Ibadan]], [[Dakar]], and [[Accra]]. Locally manufactured goods include textiles, processed meat, and metal goods as well as mining. Commercial fishing occurs on the Niger River.

In recent years, Bamako has seen significant urban development, with the construction of modern buildings, shopping malls, and infrastructure projects aimed at improving the quality of life for its residents. The city is home to many notable institutions such as the [[University of Bamako]], the [[National Museum of Mali]], the Mali National Zoo, the [[Grand Mosque of Bamako]], and the [[Modibo Keita International Airport]]. The buildings of Bamako have a unique architectural style.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bamako}}
The area of the city has evidence of settlements since the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] era.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The fertile lands of the Niger River Valley provided the people with an abundant food supply and early chiefdoms in the area grew wealthy as they established trade routes linking across west Africa, the [[Sahara]], and leading to northern Africa and Europe as early as 600s BCE. The early inhabitants traded [[gold]], [[ivory]], [[kola nut]]s, and salt. By the 11th century, the [[Empire of Ghana]] became the first kingdom to dominate the area, later succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]].<ref name="AFN">{{cite web|url=http://www.africatravelling.net/mali/bamako/bamako_history.htm |title=Bamako ‚Äì History |publisher=Africatravelling.net |access-date=23 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923033144/http://www.africatravelling.net/mali/bamako/bamako_history.htm |archive-date=23 September 2009 }}</ref>

The ''kafu'' (chiefdom) of Bamako was founded around 1650 by the Niare family, perhaps associated with a [[Soninke people|Soninke]] man named Bamba Sanogo. The Toure and Drave families, mostly clerics and merchants, were also prominent in early Bamako.{{sfn|Perinbam|1999|p=4}}<ref name = Soninkara>{{cite web |last1=Fofana |first1=Moussa |title=Point d‚ÄôHistoire du Mali: Le Royaume de Sosso ou Khaniaga des Sonink√© |url=http://www.soninkara.org/actualite-soninke/point-dhistoire-du-mali-le-royaume-de-sosso-ou-khaniaga-des-soninke-1337.html |website=Soninkara |access-date=17 October 2024|date=31 July 2007}}</ref> It was a client state of the [[Segou Empire]].{{sfn|Perinbam|1999|p=2}} The Scottish explorer [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] visited Bamako in 1806 during his exploration of the Niger River. He estimated that the city at the time held 6000 inhabitants, similar to many other commercial settlements across West Africa at the time.{{sfn|Imperato|1996|p=45}}{{sfn|Perinbam|1999|p=19}}

[[File:Fort de Bammakou.jpg|thumb|left|French Fort of Bammakou, built in 1883]]
In February 1882, [[Samory Toure]] defeated the French at the Battle of Samaya outside [[Kinieran]]. Faced with Toure's expanding [[Wassoulou Empire]], some of the leaders of the Dyula community in Bamako began making overtures to join the anti-French alliance. The French commander [[Gustave Borgnis-Desbordes]], eager to possess this key strategic location on the Niger, rushed a force to establish a fort there on 1 February 1883.<ref name = Fofana>{{cite book |last1=Fofana |first1=Khalil |title=L' Almami Samori Tour√© Empereur |date=1998 |publisher=Pr√©sence Africaine |location=Paris |isbn=978-2-7087-0678-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/lalmamisamoritou00fofa/page/16/mode/2up |access-date=30 September 2023}}</ref>{{rp|76}} Kebe Brema, Samory's brother, led a force to Bamako to lure the French out of their defenses.

In 1904 a railroad was built connecting Bamako to [[Kayes]], and the city began growing quickly upon being named the capital of [[French Sudan]] in 1908.{{sfn|Imperato|1996|p=45}} The [[Cercles of Mali|cercle]] of Mali at this time had around 160 000 inhabitants living in 4-500 villages.{{sfn|Perinbam|1999|p=17}} [[Dakar-Niger railroad|A railroad]] connecting Bamako to [[Dakar]] was completed in 1923.<ref name = decline>{{cite web |title=Le train Dakar-Bamako : histoire d‚Äôun lent d√©clin |url=https://au-senegal.com/le-train-dakar-bamako-histoire-d-un-lent-declin,15765.html?lang=fr |website=Kaay Xool |publisher=Au Senegal |access-date=19 September 2023 |date=26 November 2019}}</ref> 

Mali gained independence from France in April 1960, and the Republic of Mali was later established. At this time, Bamako had a population of around 160,000. During the 1960s, the country became socialist and Bamako was subject to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] investment and influence.<ref name="AFN" /> However, the economy declined as state enterprises collapsed and unrest was widespread.<ref name="AFN" /> Eventually, [[Moussa Traor√©]] led a successful coup and ruled Mali for 23 years. However his rule was characterised by severe droughts and poor government management and problems of food shortages.<ref name="AFN" />

In the late 1980s the people of Bamako and Mali campaigned for a free-market economy and multiparty democracy. In 1990, the [[National Congress for Democratic Initiative]] (''Congr√®s National d'Initiative d√©mocratique'', CNID) was set up by the lawyer [[Mountaga Tall]], and the [[Alliance for Democracy in Mali]] (''Alliance pour la d√©mocratie au Mali'', ADEMA) by Abdramane Baba and historian [[Alpha Oumar Konar√©]]. These with the ''Association des √©l√®ves et √©tudiants du Mali'' (AEEM) and the [[Association Malienne des Droits de l'Homme]] (AMDH) aimed to oust Moussa Traor√©. Under the old constitution, all labor unions had to belong to one confederation, the [[National Union of Malian Workers]] (UNTM). When the leadership of the UNTM broke from the government in 1990, the opposition grew. Groups were driven by paycuts and layoffs in the government sector, and the Malian government acceding to pressure from international donors to privatise large swathes of the economy that had remained in public hands even after the overthrow of the socialist government in 1968. Students, even children, played an increasing role in the protest marches in Bamako, and homes and businesses of those associated with the regime were ransacked by crowds.

On 22 March 1991, a large-scale protest march in central Bamako was violently suppressed, with estimates of those killed reaching 300. Four days later, a military coup deposed Traor√©. The ''Comit√© de Transition pour le Salut du Peuple'' was set up, headed by General [[Amadou Toumani Tour√©]].<ref>Patrick Manning. Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa, 1880‚Äì1995: 1880‚Äì1995.

==Geography==
[[File:Pont des Martyrs Bamako.jpg|thumb|right|Pont des Martyrs]]
Bamako is situated on the Niger River floodplain, which hampers development along the riverfront and the Niger's tributaries. Bamako is relatively flat, except to the immediate north where an [[escarpment]] is found, being what remains of an extinct volcano. The Presidential Palace and main hospital are located here.

[[File:ViewFromTheSouthernShoreOfCiteDuNiger.jpg|right|thumb|Niger river]]
[[File:Hilltop view over Bamako.jpg|thumb|right|Hills around Bamako]]
[[File:Bamakolooking north from the old bridge.jpg|thumb|left|Road in Bamako. Kuluba hill, with the Presidential Palace, is in the background.]]

Originally, the city developed on the northern side of the river, but as it grew, bridges were developed to connect the north with the south. The first of these was the [[Martyrs Bridge (Bamako)|Pont des Martyrs]] (2-lane with two pedestrian sections) and the [[King Fahd Bridge (Bamako)|King Fahd Bridge]] (four-lane with two motorcycle and two pedestrian sections). Additionally, a seasonal causeway between the eastern neighborhoods of Sotuba and Misabugu was inherited from colonial times (alternated traffic on one lane with five crossing sections). The [[Sotuba Causeway]] (''Chauss√©e submersible de Sotuba'' in French, and ''Babilikoroni'' in [[Bambara language|Bamanankan]]) is typically under water from July to January. A third bridge (1.4&nbsp;km long, 24 m wide, four-lane with two motorcycle and two pedestrian sections) is being built at the same location<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=18466|title=maliweb.net :: Construction du 3e Pont de Bamako : Maliens et Chinois d'accord sur les aspects techniques du projet|access-date=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525222445/http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=18466|archive-date=25 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> to reduce downtown congestion, notably by trucks.

===Climate===
Under the [[K√∂ppen climate classification]], Bamako features a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification|K√∂ppen]] ''Aw''). Located in the [[Sudanian Savanna|Sudano]]-[[Sahel]]ian zone, Bamako is very hot on average all year round with the hottest months being between March and May. The mildest months are between November and February. During the dry season, rainfall is scarce: virtually none falls between November and April due to the dominance of the Saharan anticyclone and the dry [[trade winds]]. The rainy season occurs in the summer with the peak occurring with a few storms beginning in May, then transitioning to the monsoon from June to October.

=== Waste Management Controversy ===
In 2015, the Bamako city government privatized waste collection in the city. Before the introduction of this program there was a long standing informal waste collection system carried out by "Economic interest groups."<ref>{{Cite web|last=EJOLT|title=QUATRE ANS APR√àS LA SIGNATURE DU CONTRAT OZONE MALI : AUCUNE PARTIE N'EST SATISFAITE|date=5 March 2019 |url=http://bamada.net/quatre-ans-apres-la-signature-du-contrat-ozone-mali-aucune-partie-nest-satisfaite|lang=fr|access-date=21 April 2021|archive-date=21 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210421160542/http://bamada.net/quatre-ans-apres-la-signature-du-contrat-ozone-mali-aucune-partie-nest-satisfaite|url-status=live}}</ref> Before the privatization these independent groups collected waste throughout the city. After privatization, not only did many waste collectors become unemployed but the corporation that they enlisted to do the job was collecting only 30% of Bamako's waste. The garbage build up creates toxic living conditions and it only worsens when it rains. Due to the prevalence of waste in Bamako's streets, including informal dumping sites near a school, citizens have taken to protesting, marching and it has even escalated to the point of property damage.<ref>{{Cite web|last=EJOLT|title=Waste collection dispute in Bamako, Mali {{!}} EJAtlas|url=https://ejatlas.org/conflict/privatization-of-waste-management-and-displacement-of-informal-recyclers-in-bamako-mali|access-date=19 April 2021|website=[[Environmental Justice Atlas]]|language=en|archive-date=19 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210419155059/https://ejatlas.org/conflict/privatization-of-waste-management-and-displacement-of-informal-recyclers-in-bamako-mali|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Administration==
The District of Bamako has been divided into six communes (distinguished by numbers, and not named) since Ordinance No. 78-34/CNLM of 18 August 1978, and amended by a law in February 1982 establishing the new boundaries of Communes III and IV.<ref>[http://www.essor.gov.ml/jour/cgi-bin/view_article.pl?id=21982 Ordonnance n¬∞ 78-34/CNLM du 18 ao√ªt 1978, modifi√©e par une loi de f√©vrier 1982 fixant les nouvelles limites des Communes III et IV, cit√© par Doussou Djir√©, Commune IV : entre tradition et modernit√©]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, l'Essor, 24 April 2009</ref> Each commune is administered by the municipal council and a mayor elected from among its members.

<ref>Industrial Census in 2006, provided the Council of Ministers of 20 December 2006.</ref> The service sector is the most developed, and the city thrives in crafts and trade.

The traditional commercial center of Bamako was located to the north of the river, and contained within a triangle bounded by Avenue du Fleuve, Rue Baba Diarra, and Boulevard du Peuple. This area contains the March√© Rose and Street Market.

The downtown area is highly congested, polluted, and expensive, and urbanization is sprawling at a rapid pace within a radius of {{convert|30|km}}. The largest urbanized area now lies on the southern bank of the Niger River. A modern central business district is rapidly developing immediately west of the downtown area in the ACI-2000 district, taking advantage of a well-designed geometric layout, legacy of the old airport runways and taxiways. A large administrative area is being developed at the junction between ACI-2000 and the King Fadh Bridge, containing most of the state departments (ministries) and administrative services in a central location. Bamako is also the headquarters of many large companies and administrative institutions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Air Mali (2005)|Air Mali]] (formerly Compagnie A√©rienne du Mali) has its head office in Bamako.<ref>"[http://www.camaero.com/pages/en/contattaci/contattaci.aspx?language=en Contact-us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506053454/http://www.camaero.com/pages/en/contattaci/contattaci.aspx?language=en |date=6 May 2015 }}."

Agriculture is active in Bamako, with the presence of [[Bozo people|Bozo]] fisherman, and it is common to see cattle crossing the streets.

===Energy===
{{unreferencedsect|date=May 2024}}
Much of the electricity is generated from the hydroelectric [[S√©lingu√© Dam]]. The drinking water supply in Bamako and [[Kati]] is also ensured by a pumping station on the Niger River. However, the capacity of {{convert|135000|m3}} to provide drinking water per day is insufficient for the needs estimated at {{convert|152000|m3}} during the hot season between April and June. During this period, frequent water shortages are experienced. A new pumping station was to open in Kabala in 2009.

[[File:BamakoMali.jpg|thumb|People gathered on a Bamako hillside]]
Bamako has experienced staggering population growth. In 1884, it had only 2,500 inhabitants, 8,000 in 1908, 37,000 in 1945, and 100,000 in 1960. Today, the population is over 42 times what it was in 1960, with a population of 4,227,569 recorded at the 2022 census, and continues to attract a rural population in search of work.<ref>Institut national de la statistique (Mali), 
[http://www.instat-mali.org/nada/index.php/catalog/8 Recensement G√©n√©ral de la Population et de l'Habitat 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105062138/http://www.instat-mali.org/nada/index.php/catalog/8 |date=5 November 2018 }}, instat-mali.org, Mali, 3 April 2014</ref> This uncontrolled growth has caused significant difficulties in terms of traffic, sanitation (including access to safe water), and pollution. Bamako hosts a diverse population composed of different ethnic groups in Mali and from neighboring countries.

==Culture==
The [[National Library of Mali]] was first created by the [[Institut Fran√ßais d'Afrique Noire]], an arm of the French colonial government, in 1944. Following Mali's 1960 independence, this library became the Government Library; it would later be renamed again as the National Library of Mali. In 1968, the library was transferred from its initial home in Koulouba to Ouolofobougou, a section of Bamako. The library holds more than 60,000 works, including books, periodicals, audio documents, videos, and software. These materials are available free to the public, though a small subscription fee is required for borrowing privileges. The library also hosts some of the exhibits for [[African Photography Encounters]], a biannual Bamako photography festival.

The [[National Museum of Mali]] is an archeological and anthropological museum, presenting permanent and temporary exhibits on the prehistory of Mali, as well as the musical instruments, dress, and ritual objects associated with Mali's various [[ethnic group]]s. The National Museum began under French rule as the Sudanese Museum, part of the [[Institut Fran√ßais d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN) under [[Th√©odore Monod]]. It was opened on 14 February 1953, under the direction of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] archeologist [[Yuriy Shumovskyi]]. Shumovskyi had worked in the museum for nine years, gathering half (nearly 3,000) of today's finds. The museum also houses indoor and outdoor exhibitions of works by local artists.
[[File:BamakoMuseum.jpg|thumb|Artist display at Bamako Museum depicting life in Mali]]

With the independence of the Republic of Mali in 1960, the Sudanese Museum became the National Museum of Mali, with the new objectives of promoting national unity and celebrating Malian traditional culture. However, lack of financial means and absence of qualified personnel caused some deterioration in the museum's collections. On 30 March 1956, the National Museum moved into a new [[cement]]ed structure, created by architect [[Jean-Loup Pivin]] from traditional Malian designs. Since the 1996 election of former archaeologist [[Alpha Oumar Konar√©]] to Mali's presidency, the museum's funding has increased considerably, becoming among the best in West Africa. The museum often hosts part of the biannual [[African Photography Encounters]], photography festival held in Bamako since 1994.

Also of note is the [[Muso Kunda Museum]], the [[Bamako Regional Museum]], [[Bamako Zoo]], the [[Bamako Botanical Gardens]], the National Conference Center Tower (NCC), the Souvenir Pyramid, the Independence Monument, Al Quoods Monument, the triangular ''Monument de la paix'', the Hamdallaye obelisk, the Modibo Keita Memorial and many other monuments, the [[Palais de la Culture Amadou Hampat√© Ba]] and the [[Point G]] hill, containing caves with [[Rock art|rock paintings]].

In 1988, Bamako was the location of a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] conference known as the [[Bamako Initiative]] that helped reshape health policy of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. The yearly held [[Budapest-Bamako]] rally has the endpoint in Bamako, with the [[Dakar Rally]] often passing through Bamako.

[https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Mali%20carte%20de%20reference%20sep2013.pdf]

Much of the transportation is either by the Niger River, or by paved roads linking Bamako to other major urban areas. Navigating the river is possible from Koulikoro to Mopti and Gao. The bush taxi is one of the main modes of transport.

Bamako is situated on both sides of the Niger River and three bridges connect the two banks: the Bridge of Martyrs completed in 1960 and renamed in memory of protesters killed in March 1991 by the regime of [[Moussa Traor√©]], the [[King Fahd Bridge (Bamako)|King Fahd Bridge]], named after the Saudi Arabian donor, and a third bridge, the ''Pont de l'amiti√© sino-malienne'' funded by the People's Republic of China. Located in Sotuba area, it has the objective to decongest traffic in the city.<ref>" Troisi√®me pont de Bamako : le compte √† rebours a commenc√© ", ''L'Essor'', 19 November 2007.</ref>

==Healthcare==
The Point G hospital, built between 1906 and 1913, covers {{convert|25|ha}}. A former military hospital, it became a civilian hospital shortly before the independence of Mali, and is situated on a hill overlooking Bamako.<ref>B. Doumbia, " Centenaire du Point G : Un si√®cle √† la pointe des soins et une belle histoire ", ''L'Essor'', 11 December 2006.</ref>

The second hospital of Bamako is the Gabriel Tour√© Hospital named after a young doctor and humanist Gabriel Tour√© who was born in 1910 in [[Ouagadougou]] and died in 1935 after having been contaminated by a patient with the [[pneumonic plague]]. The hospital was established in 1959.<ref>B. Doumbia, Board of Directors of the Gabriel Toure hospital: the quality imperative, L'Essor, 26 February 2009</ref>

The contract for the building of a new hospital in Bamako, to relieve pressure on the other hospital resources was signed on 27 December 2008. Located in the district of [[Yirimadio]], the department will include a pediatric and obstetrics-gynecology facilities, a department of internal medicine, medical imagery facilities and hospital care with 150 beds to support the emergency services and intensive care. This hospital, like many recent developments in Bamako is financed and equipped with Chinese investment.<ref>B. Doumbia, Futur " H√¥pital du Mali " : les travaux peuvent d√©marrer, l'Essor, 31 December 2008</ref>

==In popular culture==
Bamako has provided the backdrop or been the subject of books and films such as ''[[Bamako (film)|Bamako]]'', directed by [[Abderrahmane Sissako]]. The film depicts a trial taking place in Bamako, amid the daily life that is going on in the city. In the midst of that trial, two sides argue whether the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], or perhaps corruption, are guilty of the financial state of many poverty-stricken African countries. The film was first released at the Cannes Film Festival on 21 May 2006 and in [[Manhattan]] by [[New Yorker Films]] on 14 February 2007 and was the recipient of the first [[Film Award of the Council of Europe]] given at the [[Istanbul International Film Festival]] in April 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1118399 |title="Bamako", winner of the first Council of Europe film award in Istanbul |date=14 April 2007 |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |access-date=14 April 2009 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191007/https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1118399 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bamako was one of the cities featured in ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)|Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', an educational computer game staple of the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=27 January 2011|title=The Geopolitics of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/the-geopolitics-of-where-in-the-world-is-carmen-sandiego/70369/|access-date=30 October 2020|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|archive-date=4 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201204024628/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/the-geopolitics-of-where-in-the-world-is-carmen-sandiego/70369/|url-status=live}}</ref>
