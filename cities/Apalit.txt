'''Apalit''', officially the '''Municipality of Apalit''' ({{langx|pam|Balen ning Apalit}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Apalit}}), is a first-class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pampanga]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 117,160 people.{{PH census|current}}

The town is famous for its '''Apung Iru Fluvial Procession''', which is listed as one of the most significant water-based intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines where the festival happens every ''June 28thâ€“30th''; and for its '''blacksmithing'''.

==Etymology==
The town got its name after a big sturdy tree with the scientific name ''[[Pterocarpus indicus]]'' also known as ''Narra'', known by [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] as ''Apalit''.

==History==
Apalit received official recognition as a separate town in 1582, while Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa was the country's governor-general at the time. Apalit's town was mostly made up of four encomiendas: Apali (Pale), La Castilla, Cabambangan, and Capalangan.  San Juan Nepomuceno was the new name given to the enconmienda "La Castilla" once it had been transformed into a town proper (Poblacion). 

After severing ties with the Parish of Calumpit, The Apalit Parish of Saint Peter was established in 1597. 

Capitan del Pueblo Don Pedro Armayan-Espiritu y Macam created the customary fluvial parade of Saint Peter on June 28, 1844, commonly known as "Libad ng Apung Iru," which is still observed today in Apalit during its town festival.

It is thought that the son of a specific Gatbonton named Pangpalung, who was once known as Macapagal, built Barrio Capalangan, which takes its name from the Kapampangan word "Palang" meaning machete or bolo, which the barangay takes pride of.  

This Barrio was the home of Panday Pira, the first well-known Filipino maker of cannons, and got its name from the Kapampangan word "Palang," which means Bolo or Machete. It is said to have been founded by the son of a particular Gatbonton named Pangpalung, who in his youth also went by the name "Macapagal." After the Spanish conquest of Manila, he worked under Adelantado and Governor General Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, producing "Lantakas" cannons for Rajah Soliman's army.

During the reign of Capitan del Pueblo Don Joaquin Arnedo de la Cruz y Tanjutco and his heiress wife, Dona Maria de la Paz Sioco y Carlos, viuda de Tanjutco, Puerto Sulipan was once regarded as a haven for big businesses, politics, and "high society" in the Philippines from the 1850s until the 1910s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sison |first=Louie |date=July 13, 2022 |title=Apalit |url=https://whereinpampanga.com/apalit/ |access-date=August 6, 2023 |website=Where In Pampanga}}</ref>

{{main|San Pedro Apostol Church (Apalit)}}

Apalit was first established as one of the visitas (mission chapel) under the administration of Convento de Calumpit.
In 1597, the Augustinian chapter accepted Apalit as House of Order under the advocacy of San Pedro Apostol where Fray Pedro de Vergara OSA as its first [[parish priest]] In conjunction with the annual town fiesta, the ''Libad'' was established by the ''Capitan del Pueblo'', ''Don'' Pedro Armayan-EspÃ­ritu y Macam, on June 28, 1844.Libad fluvial procession also reaching Calumpit even today to signify the old relationship of Apalit to its mother town Calumpit where San Juan Bautista is the patron of the Town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andropampanga.com/history_apalit.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228090758/http://www.andropampanga.com/history_apalit.htm |archive-date=2009-02-28 |title=History of Pampanga Towns}}</ref>

The first church and ''[[Clergy house|convento]]'' was constructed under the tenure of Fray Juan Cabello as parish priest from 1641 to 1645. Fray SimÃ³n de Alarcia built another church made of concrete and tile in 1854â€“1860, but it was destroyed by a strong earthquake in 1863. The present neo-classical church was built under Fray Antonio Redondo, who was assigned to Apalit from 1873 to 1886.

Father Gallende wrote in ''La Iglesia de Apalit'':

{{blockquote|"Father Antonio Redondo, parish priest of Apalit from 1873 to 1886 laid the foundations of a new one in January 1876, following the plans of ''Don'' RamÃ³n Hermosa, assistant officer to the minister of public works. The foreman was a certain Mariano Santos, a native of [[Guagua, Pampanga|Guagua]]. After seven years of work, the church was finally completed in 1883. It was "the pride of Pampanga, an indelible tribute to Fr. Redondo and the people of Apalit.'"}}

It was officially inaugurated with solemn ceremonies held successively during the town fiesta from 28 to 30 June of the same year. The chronicler remarks that when there was no more sand or bricks, Fr. Redondo would ask the ''fiscal'' ([[sacristan]]) to go around town pealing the bells. Preceded by the town bands, he would lead the way towards the riverside with an ''azafate'' (a basket or hamper) on his head. Unquestioning, the whole town would follow him, and in less than two hours, the masons would have enough sand for two months. "The whole town of Apalit helped either with monetary donations, personal service, or with their good wishes." The church measures 59 meters long and 14 meters wide. The painting was done by a native of Apalit, an industrious pupil of Alberoni. The church possesses the qualities of good construction: "solidity, capacity, light and artistic beauty."

The towers were completed under the guidance of Rev TorÃ­bio Fanjul in 1896. In 1989, a major church renovation was initiated by [[Monsignor]] RÃºstico G. Cuevas.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Capiling|first1=Alejandro S.|title=Pampanga's Churches|url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~camiling/churches/apalit.htm}}</ref>

=====Feast of Saint Peter=====
The ''Libad'', a fluvial procession in honour of the town's [[patron saint]] [[Peter the Apostle]] (known locally ''Apung Iru''), is annually from 28 to 30 June. The event, where a centuries-old ivory image of the apostle is paraded along the [[Pampanga River]], is one of the more famous religious processions in Pampanga.

=====History of the Image of Apung Iru=====
[[File:Apung_Iru_Festival_Apalit_Town_Fiesta_(Apalit,_Pampanga;_06-30-2023)_E911a_20.jpg|thumb|right|298x298px| 178th year "Libad" (Apung Iru Festival - 426th Apalit Town Fiesta) with seated 1700s image of "Apung Iru"]]
The life-sized, seated image of "Apung Iru" is an heirloom of the <u>Armayan-EspÃ­ritu y Macam</u> clan of ''[[Sitio Alauli]]'', San Vicente, Apalit.  The image, with its ivory face and hands, dates from the last quarter of the 1700s. Family tradition has it that <u>''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Pedro Armayan-EspÃ­ritu y Macam</u> (d. 1904)â€“or his parents <u>''Don'' Calixto Armayan-EspÃ­ritu and ''DoÃ±a'' MarÃ­a Macam</u>, acquired the image from an aunt, <u>''DoÃ±a'' MÃ¡xima Santos</u>â€“in exchange for a considerable parcel of agricultural land in Apalit. During the Spanish colonial era, Spanish friars shrewdly assigned the ownership of the town's patron saint to wealthy families, so that the former could be spared the expenses of its upkeep and annual ''fiesta''. The first ''Libad'' was held in 1844.

Custody of the image of ''Apung Iru'' has passed to the direct descendants of <u>''Don'' Pedro Armayan-EspÃ­ritu y Macam</u>, who married three times: first to <u>''DoÃ±a'' Dorotea Arnedo</u>; then <u>MÃ¡xima Santa Rita</u>; and finally <u>Ysabel Dungo y Nocom</u>. <u>''Don'' Pedro</u> originally bequeathed the image to his favourite, his youngest daughter <u>''DoÃ±a'' Ysidora "Orang" EspÃ­ritu y Dungo</u> (later <u>Mrs. JesÃºs Justo GonzÃ¡lez</u>), but she did not want the responsibility of being the image's ''camarera'' (custodian). She passed it on to her elder, [[spinster]] sister <u>''DoÃ±a'' Aurea "Ondeng" EspÃ­ritu y Dungo</u>. After ''DoÃ±a'' Aurea's early death, ''Don'' Pedro's eldest daughter <u>''DoÃ±a'' MarÃ­a "Maruja" EspÃ­ritu y Dungo</u> (later Mrs. Macario Arnedo) became the image's ''camarera''.  In 1928, ''DoÃ±a'' MarÃ­a [[Translation (relic)|translated]] the image of ''Apung Iru'' from the Armayan-EspÃ­ritu ancestral home in ''[[Sitio]]'' Alauli in Barangay San Vicente to her house in ''[[Barrio]]'' Capalangan, where it has remained since.

''DoÃ±a'' MarÃ­a died in 1934, and her second daughter <u>''DoÃ±a'' Ysabel "Tabing" Arnedo y EspÃ­ritu</u> (later Mrs .Fernando DueÃ±as Reyes) became the image's "camarera" until her own death in 1970. ''DoÃ±a'' MarÃ­a's third daughter, <u>''DoÃ±a'' Rosario Lucia "Charing" Arnedo y EspÃ­ritu</u> (later Mrs. Augusto Diosdado Sioco GonzÃ¡lez) became ''camarera'' until her death in May 1977. The youngest daughter, <u>''DoÃ±a'' Elisa Juana "Ising" Arnedo y EspÃ­ritu</u> (later Mrs Fortunato Kabiling Sazon) became the next ''camarera'' until her death in May 1987. ''DoÃ±a'' Elisa's eldest daughter, <u>Dr. Erlinda Crispina "Linda" Arnedo Sazon</u> (later Mrs. Enrique EspÃ­ritu Badenhop) succeeded her mother as ''camarera'' from until her own death in February 2008. <u>Augusto Marcelino "Toto" Reyes GonzÃ¡lez III</u>, ''DoÃ±a'' Rosario's grandson from her eldest son, Augusto Beda, is the current ''camarero'' of ''Apung Iru'', following a stipulation that ''DoÃ±a'' Rosario and ''DoÃ±a'' Ysidora made to the family in 1970.

In 1975, ''DoÃ±a'' Ysidora, ''DoÃ±a'' Rosario, and the latter's son Brother Andrew Benjamin GonzÃ¡lez, F.S.C., established Saint Peter's Mission, Inc. with the stipulation that ''Apung Iru'' and his feast be maintained by the generations to come.

=== Prominent Families of Apalit ===
Apalit is home to several prominent families whose wealth and influence date back to the 1800s and 1900s. These families have played significant roles in the town's history, culture, and development. The following are some of the notable families from Apalit:

* '''Familia Arnedo'''
** The Arnedo family is one of the most prominent and influential families in Apalit. Their lineage can be traced back to the Spanish colonial period. They were known for their vast agricultural lands and involvement in local politics.
