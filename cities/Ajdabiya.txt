'''Ajdabiya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|dʒ|d|ə|ˈ|b|iː|ə}} {{respell|AHJ|də|BEE|ə}}; {{langx|ar|أجدابيا|Aǧdābiyā}}) is a town in and capital of the [[Al Wahat District]] in northeastern [[Libya]]. It is some {{convert|150|km}} south of [[Benghazi]]. From 2001 to 2007 it was part of and capital of the [[Ajdabiya District]].  The town is divided into three [[Basic People's Congress (administrative division)|Basic People's Congresses]]: North Ajdabiya, West Ajdabiya and East Ajdabiya.<ref name="GPCO-shabiya">[http://gpco.gov.ly/online/shabyat.php "شعبيات الجماهيرية العظمى "] Sha'biyat of Great Jamahiriya, accessed July 6, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207003234/http://gpco.gov.ly/online/shabyat.php |date=February 7, 2009 }}</ref>

During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], the city [[battle of Ajdabiya|changed hands]] several times between rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces, with the anti-Gaddafi forces finally securing the town in April 2011.  As many civilians had fled the fighting, one March 2011 report described the city as a "ghost town."<ref>Elisbeth Bumiller and David Kirkpatrick  [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/world/africa/24libya.html Allies Pressure Qaddafi Forces Around Rebel Cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626101841/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/world/africa/24libya.html |date=June 26, 2017 }} ''[[The New York Times]]'' March 23, 2011</ref>  
  
Later, during the [[Second Libyan Civil War]], the city was seized by the [[Ajdabiya Revolutionaries Shura Council]] until it was taken over by the [[Libyan National Army]] on 21 February 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-benghazi/army-claims-advances-in-libyan-cities-of-benghazi-and-ajdabiya-idUSKCN0VU0UM |title=Army claims advances in Libyan cities of Benghazi and Ajdabiya &#124; Reuters |website=[[Reuters]] |access-date=October 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918193952/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-benghazi/army-claims-advances-in-libyan-cities-of-benghazi-and-ajdabiya-idUSKCN0VU0UM |archive-date=September 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
Ajdabiya is situated in central northern Libya near the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coast at the eastern end of the [[Gulf of Sidra]]. It is located on an arid plain about {{convert|6.4|km}} from the sea, {{convert|850|km}} from the Libyan capital of [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] and {{convert|150|km}} from Libya's second largest city, [[Benghazi]]. The city is the site of an important crossroads between the coastal road from Tripoli to Benghazi and inland routes south to the oasis at [[Jalu]] and east to [[Tobruk]] and the border with [[Egypt]].<ref name="Azema" /> Ajdabiya lies close to the [[Sabkhat Ghuzayyil]], a large dry region below sea level.

===Climate===
Ajdabiya has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). For a location very close to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] it is very prone to strong [[heat waves]] and has reached above {{convert|47|C|F}} as early as in April in spite of the sea having mild surface temperatures that time of the year. This is due to hot winds from the [[Sahara Desert]] bringing extreme temperatures north. In summer Ajdabiya is similar to interior climates in Southern Europe, except drier. Winters are mild, with occasional rainfall.

== History ==
Ajdabiya has been identified as the site of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city of ''Corniclanum'', which is shown on the [[Peutinger Table]] of the Roman road network in the fourth or fifth centuries AD.<ref>al-ʻĀmmah lil-Āthār wa-al-Matāḥif wa-al-Maḥfūẓāt, Idārah. ''Libya antiqua, Volumes 8–10'', p. xlii. Libyan Department of Antiquities, 1971</ref> It gained its importance for two reasons: it possessed drinkable water, which made it a useful staging post in an arid region, and it stood on the intersection of two important trade routes, the coastal route along the North African littoral and the desert caravan route from the oases of Jalu and al-Ujlah.<ref name="Azema" /> The town passed to the [[Byzantine Empire]] following the fall of Rome but gained new importance under the rule of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. After sacking the town in 912, the Fatimids redeveloped Ajdabiya and built a new mosque and palace complex, the ruins of which can still be seen.<ref>{{cite book| last = Petersen| first = Andrew| title = Dictionary of Islamic Architecture| year = 1999| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-21332-5| pages = 8–9 }}</ref> Around 1051–52 it was sacked again, this time by the [[Beni Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]], Arab tribes that migrated to North Africa at the instigation of the Fatimids. It subsequently fell into a prolonged period of decline.<ref name="Azema">{{cite book| last = Azema| first = James| title = Libya Handbook The Travel Guide| year = 2000| publisher = Footprint Handbooks| isbn = 978-1-900949-77-4| pages = 136–137 }}</ref>

In the 12th century, the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] described Ajdabiya as "a town situated on a flat, stony plateau". He wrote in his treatise ''Nuzhat al-Mushtaq'' (published in Europe as ''De geographia universali''):

:In olden times [Ajdabiya] was surrounded by walls, but now only two forts remain standing in the desert. Ajdabiya is four miles distant from the sea. There is no vegetation in the town nor around it. The majority of its inhabitants are Jewish and Muslim merchants. Around the town tribes of the [[Berber people|Berber]] wander about in great numbers. There is no running water either in Ajdabiya or in Barqa, and the people get their water from cisterns and water-pits (''sawani''), [which they use] to grow a small amount of wheat, but mainly barley and various kinds of pulses and cereals.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Hopkins| first1 = J.F.P.| authorlink2=Nehemiah Levtzion|last2 = Levtzion| first2 = Nehemia| title = Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History| year = 2000| publisher = Markus Wiener Publishing| isbn = 978-1-55876-241-1| page = 129 }}</ref>

[[File:متحف إجدابيا - Ajdabiya museum.jpg|left|thumb|Ajdabiya museum]]

The town was later revived by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] to serve as a minor administrative centre for western [[Cyrenaica]]. It became an important centre for the [[Senussi]] movement in the early 20th century and became the capital of an autonomous Senussi-ruled region between 1920 and 1923 under the terms of an accord with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which had occupied Libya from 1911. In April 1923, however, the accord broke down and the Italians seized Ajdabiya, turning it into an important military outpost.<ref name="Azema" /> The area was the scene of heavy fighting during the [[Second World War]]; during [[Operation Compass]], British forces forced Italian troops to retreat through Ajdabiya (February 1941, [[Battle of Beda Fomm]]), but soon later they lost control of it again on April 2, 1941, when [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel's]] [[Afrikakorps]] counter-attacked.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Greene| first1 = Jack| last2 = Massignani| first2 = Alessandro| title = Rommel's North Africa Campaign September 1940 – November 1942| year = 1999| publisher = Da Capo Press| isbn = 978-1-58097-018-1| page = 55 }}</ref> The town finally reverted to Allied control on November 23, 1942, when it was recaptured by the British [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]].<ref>"Defeat Of The Wehrmacht II – How Alamein Was Planned And Won, The Army Commander's Vital Decisions". ''The Times'', February 18, 1947; p. 5</ref>

Ajdabiya's fortunes were transformed after the war by the development of the Libyan oil industry at nearby [[Brega]]. By 1979 it had become a boom town with a population of about 32,000 people. The bulk of the male population worked in the oil industry, government service or other local service industries. The town acquired a new area of public housing, police stations, educational facilities and a general hospital run by Libya's ally [[Bulgaria]]. In other respects, however, it remained comparatively undeveloped – many of the roads were left as dirt tracks without drainage, resulting in them being muddy and flooded in the winter and dirty and dusty in the summer. Libya's predominately tribal society also resulted in an unusual style of urbanisation; nomadic members of the Zuwaya tribe settled on the outskirts of the town and established tent camps, which they gradually replaced with houses. The layout of some areas of the town thus resembles that of nomadic camps, with a senior man in the centre of an area, his married sons nearby, with their younger brothers and their own sons clustered around them.<ref>{{cite book| last = Davis| first = John| title = Libyan Politics Tribe and Revolution an Account of the Zuwaya and Their Government| year = 1988| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-06294-8| pages = 82–84 }}</ref>
