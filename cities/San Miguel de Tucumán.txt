'''San Miguel de Tucumán''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsam miˈɣel de tukuˈman}}), usually called simply '''Tucumán''', is the capital and largest city of [[Tucumán Province]], located in northern [[Argentina]] {{convert|1311|km}} from [[Buenos Aires]]. It is the fifth-largest city of Argentina after Buenos Aires, [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and the most important of the northern region. The Spanish [[conquistador]] [[:es:Diego de Villarroel|Diego de Villarroel]] founded the city in 1565 in the course of an expedition from present-day [[Peru]]. Tucumán moved to its present site in 1685.

==Overview==
{{panorama|image=File:Panorámica del centro tucumano.jpg|height=353|caption={{center|Panoramic view of the city's center}}}}
The city is bordered on the north by Las Talitas ([[Tafí Viejo, Tucumán|Tafí Viejo]]), on the east by [[Banda del Río Salí]] and [[Alderetes (Tucumán)|Alderetes]] (Cruz Alta), on the west by the city of [[Yerba Buena, Tucumán|Yerba Buena]], and on the south by Lules.

The city is located on the slopes of the Aconquija mountains, the easternmost mountain range before the large [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]]-[[Pampas|Pampean]] flats. It is the commercial center of an irrigated area that produces large quantities of [[sugarcane]], [[rice]], [[tobacco]], and [[fruit]], giving the province its nickname, the Garden of the Republic. The [[National University of Tucumán]] (1914) and the [[Saint Thomas Aquinas University of the North]] (1965) are in the city.

On July 9, 1816, a [[Congress of Tucumán|congress gathered in Tucumán]] declared independence from [[Spain]], which did not officially recognize it until 1862. The meeting place of the congress, the [[House of Tucumán]], has been reconstructed as a national monument.  After the national government broke down in 1820, the town was capital of the short-lived [[Republic of Tucumán]].

Its telephone code is 0381, and its postal codes are T4000 (Center), T4001 (North), T4002 (South) and T4003 (East).

== Climate ==

San Miguel de Tucuman lies in a transition zone between temperate climates to the south, and subtropical climates to the north. It has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]], with vastly more precipitation in the summer than in the winter.<ref name = Sesma1998>{{cite web |last1=Sesma |first1=Pablo |last2=Guido |first2=Elvira |last3=Puchulu |first3=Maria |year=1998 |title=Clima de la Provincia de Tucuman |url=http://www.csnat.unt.edu.ar/ed/public/investigacion/geologia/Clima%20en%20Libro%20Geol.%20Tuc.%201998.pdf |access-date=1 August 2015}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|19.3|C|F|1}}.<ref name=IRNtucuman>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830200033/http://www.mineria.gob.ar/estudios/irn/tucuman/t-2.asp |archive-date=August 30, 2015 |url=http://www.mineria.gob.ar/estudios/irn/tucuman/t-2.asp#m1 |language=es|title=Provincia de Tucuman–Clima Y Metéorologia|publisher=Secretaria de Mineria de la Nacion (Argentina)|access-date=August 2, 2015}}</ref>  The precipitation pattern is monsoonal: out of the {{convert|966|mm|in|abbr=on}} that fall annually, most of it falls in the summer months, while the winter months tend to be drier.<ref name=IRNtucuman/><ref name = SMN>{{cite web| url = http://www.smn.gov.ar/serviciosclimaticos/?mod=turismo&id=7&provincia=Tucum%E1n&ciudad=Tucum%E1n | language = es | title = Datos Estadísticos (Período 1981-1990) | publisher = National Meteorological Service of Argentina | access-date = April 10, 2013}}</ref> The average temperature in winter is {{convert|13.6|C|F|1}}.<ref name=Sesma1998/> July is the coldest month with a mean temperature of {{convert|12.1|C|F|1}}.<ref name=SMN/> Frosts are uncommon, with some years recording no frosts at all.<ref name=heladas>{{cite web|url=http://www.agro.uba.ar/heladas/tucuman_aero_0.htm |language=es| title=Heladas Meteorológicas–Tucumán Aero|publisher=Facultad de Agronomía - Universidad de Buenos Aires| access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> Usually, when frosts occur, they are light with temperatures rarely falling below {{convert|-2|C|F|1}}.<ref name=heladas/><ref name = ORA>

There have been other episodes of sleet and snow in the mountains around the city, and in 2010, sleet was reported downtown again, a very rare event.

Spring and fall are transition seasons.<ref name=SMN/> Springs are very short, and by October, summer weather settles in the city, with highs beyond {{convert|30|C|F|1}} very common. This is due to the dryness of the season: daytime highs are close to those in the summer, when rainfall and clouds are persistent, whereas spring is often sunny and arid. April marks the beginning of the fall, but temperatures remain near summer levels: {{convert|21|to|27|C|F|1}} during the day, and {{convert|12|to|18|C|F|1}} during the night. Rainfall decreases as fall progresses.

Summers are the hottest and most humid time of year.<ref name=IRNtucuman/><ref name=SMN/> The average temperature during the summer ranges from {{convert|24|to|26|C|F|1}}.<ref name=Sesma1998/> In the summer, one can expect daytime highs ranging from {{convert|30|to|31|C|F|1}}; at night, {{convert|19|to|20|C|F|1}} are the norm.<ref name=SMN/> Much of the rainfall that the city receives occurs during the summer months and cloudy weather tends to be more common, averaging 11–13 overcast days and only 2–4 clear days per month.<ref name=SMN/> Heat waves can push temperatures up to {{convert|40|to|45|C|F|1}}.<ref name=IRNtucuman/> However, some relief is possible after cold fronts from the south caused by [[Pampero (wind)|Pampero]] winds which brings in cooler air.<ref name=IRNtucuman/> These winds can be strong following a hot day in advance of the cold fronts.<ref name=IRNtucuman/>

The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|45.0|C|F|1}} on October 31, 2009 while the lowest temperature recorded was {{convert|-3.0|C|F|1}} on July 16, 1962.<ref name=SMN2/>

== History ==
[[File:TUCUMAN-1812.jpg|thumb|left|"Tucumán 1812", by [[Gerardo Flores Ivaldi]]. The Cabildo and San Francisco church are displayed on the painting.]]

[[File:Calle san martin cuando se llamaba las heras.jpg|thumb|right|San Martín street in San Miguel downtown.]]

The first foundation of "San Miguel de Tucumán y Nueva Tierra de Promisión" was on May 31, 1565 by Diego de Villarroel in the Campos de Ibatín, {{Convert|60|km}} to the southwest from where the current city is located nowadays. The city was moved to "La Toma" (where the old town or ''casco histórico'' is placed today) in 1685, due to the low quality of Ibatín water.

On September 24, 1812, the [[Battle of Tucumán]] took place near the city, when the Spanish army coming from [[Upper Peru]] were defeated by the army led by [[Manuel Belgrano]]. Belgrano had been obliged to fall back to [[Córdoba (Argentina)|Córdoba]] by the government of Buenos Aires, but the inhabitants of Tucumán called on him to resist another Spanish invasion.

With his troops almost unarmed and tired but reinforced by local [[gaucho]]s (calling themselves''Los decididos de Tucumán''), Belgrano attacked the Spanish army from behind, defeating them and ensuring the Independence of Argentina. After the battle of Tucumán, the same army led by Belgrano would achieve another victory in [[Salta, Argentina|Salta]].

After those battles, Belgrano established a circular fortress known as "La Ciudadela", located {{Convert|1|km}} from the current Plaza de la Independencia (former Plaza Mayor). Because it had patriot barracks and was located on an intermediate point between the [[Río de la Plata]] and the [[Upper Peru]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], San Miguel de Tucumán was designated as the venue for the Congress of Independence. On July 9, 1816, the [[Independence of Argentina]] was declared, not only from Spain but from any other foreign domination. The act of the Independence was signed at the [[Casa de Tucumán]], also named "Casa Histórica" or "Casa de la Independencia".

By 1850 the city's population had increased considerably, surpassing the estimated registers. Because of that, in 1870 it was proposed that the city be expanded, setting new limits. During those years, the first railway line reached the city, built by [[Great Britain|British]]-owned [[Córdoba Central Railway]]. The immigrants arriving in the region (most of whom were Spanish, Arabic, Jewish, and Italian) influenced the architectural style that adapted to those new cultures, leaving the original [[Spanish Colonial architecture|colonial style]] behind. Therefore, new buildings in the city were made in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] and picturesque styles.

During the first years of the 20th century, the city added {{Convert|400|ha}} for recreational uses, and the first great park (similar to those  existing in [[Paris]] and [[London]]) was thus established. By 1930 the city's population had doubled.

[[File:Catedral de noche y entrada al Paseo de la Independencia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cathedral]]
The House of Government of Tucumán was built in [[Art Nouveau]] style at the end of 19th century. The White Room is commonly used to receive notable people who visit the city.<ref name="Casa de Gobierno de Tucumán">[http://www.tucumanturismo.gov.ar/index.asp?centro=lugar&id_lugar=1186 "Casa de Gobierno de Tucumán"]</ref>

In the city downtown, the San Miguel de Tucumán Cathedral still preserves some colonial elements and other elements from Italian architecture. The Basílica de San Francisco (also declared a historical heritage), the Parroquia de San Roque, Basílica del Santísimo Sacramento (known as "Iglesia de Santo Domingo"), Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Merced and the Iglesia Nuestra Señora de Lourdes are some of the most important [[Church (building)|churches]] of the city.

The [[Casa de Tucumán]] (or "Casa de la Independencia"), as the site of the declaration of independence of Argentina, is the most significant building in the city. After the Congress of Tucumán various people lived in the house and deterioration became visible over the years, which is clearly evident in the famous photo taken by Angel Paganelli in 1869. The [[Government of Argentina]] acquired the historic house in 1874 with a view to its serving as a post office. Starting in the 1880s celebrations took place in the building to commemorate Independence.

Nevertheless, the government did not remodel the house until 1903, when it was demolished almost completely due to its very poor condition. The only room that was preserved from demolition was the room where the Independence was declared by the congressists. In 1942 the house was completely rebuilt, based on the original plans and the picture taken by Paganelli in 1869. For that purpose, the same kind of bricks, tejas (roof tiles) and baldosas (stone floor tiles) were used.

Other notable buildings of San Miguel include the Teatro San Martín (with some elements in neoclassical style), and the Correo Central, made in a mix of styles and a tower inspired in the palaces of [[Florence]] (specially [[Palazzo Vecchio]]), the old Legislature, the Palace of Justice, the Casino (former Savoy Hotel, built in 1912), the birthplace of [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], the Colegio Nacional Bartolomé Mitre and the Campo de las Carreras, where the battle of Tucumán took place and which is now an historical park.

== Cultural life and education ==

[[File:Orquesta y reluciente araña del Teatro San Martín.jpg|200px|thumbnail|Interior of the San Martín theatre.]]

For decades, San Miguel de Tucumán has been one of the cultural spots in the country, in part due to the influence of the  [[National University of Tucumán]]. It has been the birthplace and/or home of well-known personalities such as folk singer [[Mercedes Sosa]], author [[Tomas Eloy Martínez]], a professor at Rutgers University in the United States; musician [[Miguel Ángel Estrella]], artist/architect [[Tomás Saraceno]], painter [[Luis Lobo de la Vega]], and many others.

Two large theatres (San Martín and Alberdi) and several smaller and independent theaters offer a wide array of events, including plays, concerts, operas, and ballet, all year round. The ''Septiembre Musical'' is by far the most important cultural event during the year. This music festival, generally held at Independence Square, brings together several local and national artists who perform different musical styles ranging from folk music to rock.

Universities in the city include the public [[National University of Tucumán]] and the [[National Technological University]], and the private (and Catholic) [[Saint Thomas Aquinas University of the North]] and the [[Saint Paul T University]].

Since August 2008, the city has been the location of trials of high-ranking former military officers charged with war crimes from the 1976–83 [[National Reorganization Process|dictatorship]]. [[Luciano Menéndez]], a former colonel, was convicted for crimes against humanity, including the kidnapping and disappearance of senator (Guillermo Vargas Aignasse) on the night of the ''golpe'' (coup) in 1976. Many [[Abuelas de la Plaza de Mayo]] (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo) have been seen in and around the Tucumán trials. The convictions of Menéndez and [[Ricardo Bussi]] were the first of this round of prosecution of military leaders of the Jorge Rafael Videla dictatorship. Their sentencings were seen as symbolic victories for the mothers and grandmothers whose children or husbands were "[[Forcibly disappeared|disappeared]]" by the military during that dark period of Argentine history.

==Sports==
[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in the city. San Miguel's main football clubs are [[Club Atlético San Martín de Tucumán]] and [[Club Atlético Tucumán]]. Club Atletico San Martín is based out of San Miguel de Tucumán and was founded in 1909. This team has won four total national titles (1944, 1988, 2005, and 2007–08) and several regional titles.

The city is served by several bus lines that have routes within the city limits, and some others that connect it to the neighbouring cities of Yerba Buena, El Manantial, Tafí Viejo, Las Talitas, Banda del Río Salí, and Alderetes. San Miguel de Tucumán enjoys one of the largest bus stations in Argentina. The 30,000 m<sup>2</sup> estación central de ómnibus (opened in 1994) is the point from where hundreds of bus services arrive from and depart to almost all of the largest and mid-size cities throughout the country.

== Media ==
[[File:Tucuman Canal 8 estudios.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Channel 8 studios Tucumán.]]

San Miguel de Tucumán is home to two free-to-air television stations (''[[Channel 8 - Tucumán|Channel 8]]'' and ''[[Channel 10 - Tucumán|Channel 10]]''), four newspapers (''[[La Gaceta (Tucumán)|La Gaceta]]'', ''[[El Siglo (Tucumán)|El Siglo]]'', ''El Periódico'', ''El Tribuno de Tucumán''), three cable television companies (CCC, ATS, and TCC), and several radio stations.

== Healthcare ==
San Miguel de Tucuman is part of the Provincial Health System (Sistema Provincial de Salud or SIPROSA). This system divided the Tucuman province into four systematic areas with San Miguel being in its own area. Each area has its own public hospitals and Health Primary Attention Centers for the people. This divisions purpose was to help regulate health care assistance across the population and make it more accessible. Since then, SIPROSA has been a part of a modernizing program with the government in trying to make a successful medical records system. This would collect data from all the different resources and compile it into one database making it a lot easier and quicker for patients to pull up medical history, medical records, or anything of that nature. This is a big step for the Tucuman [[region]].
