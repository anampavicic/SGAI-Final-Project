'''Deesa''' is a city and a [[municipality]] in the [[Banaskantha district]] in the state of [[Gujarat]], India.

==History==
{{see also|Palanpur State}}
Deesa is situated on the east banks of the river [[Banas River|Banas]]. Deesa was an estate and {{transl|hi|thana}} (''[[faujdari]]'' or {{transl|hi|thanedari}}) ruled by the Mandori (Jhalori) dynasty. Today original Deesa is known as ''Juna'' Deesa.<ref name=gbp>{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUBAAAAYAAJ|year=1880|publisher=Government Central Press| pages=341–342}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

New Deesa was also recognized as Camp Deesa. In 1820, the British military [[cantonment]] named Deesa Field Brigade <ref>{{cite book|title=Deesa - Asiatic Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1MNGAAAAcAAJ&q=Deesa+Field+Brigade&pg=RA1-PA170|access-date=7 May 2012}}</ref> was built in the middle of Rajasthan and [[Palanpur]] to maintain and protect the regions between [[Abu Road|Abu]] and [[Kutch]] from dacoits and the incursions of the desert and Parkar Khosas into Vagad and north-west Gujarat.<ref name=gbp/> The cantonment had a resident [[Catholic chaplain]] and a [[chapel]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gandhinagar Archdiocese|url=http://www.cbcisite.com/Gandhinagar.htm|access-date=7 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502102303/http://www.cbcisite.com/Gandhinagar.htm|archive-date=2 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Deesa, as an estate of Palanpur, was under [[Palanpur Agency]] of [[Bombay Presidency]],<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Radhanpur|volume=22|page=785}}</ref> which in 1925 became the [[Banas Kantha Agency]]. After [[Independence of India]] in 1947, Bombay Presidency was reorganized in [[Bombay State]]. When Gujarat state was formed in 1960 from Bombay State, it fell under [[Banaskantha district]] of Gujarat. Deesa expanded significantly in recent times due to growth in agricultural produce business of potatoes and other commodities. Many Rajput clans like Gohil, Rathod, Raja, Galsar etc. reside here after migration from Rajasthan.

Deesa has a non-functioning [[Deesa Airport|airport]].

===Agriculture===
Deesa is known for its potato plantations. Considering the area under cultivation and agro-climatic conditions for potato research, a centre of All India Co-ordinated Potato Improvement Project was initiated in 1971–72, with the financial help of [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] (ICAR), [[New Delhi]]. Thereafter ICAR realized the need for multidisciplinary long-range research for increasing the production of this valuable crop and strengthened the project during Fifth Five Year Plan (1975–80) to have systematic research work on potato started to overcome the farmers problems of the state. [[Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University]] runs a potato research station in Deesa. It falls under the North Gujarat Agroclimatic Zone-IV of the State.<ref>{{cite web|title=Potato Research Station, Deesa|url=http://www.sdau.edu.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=289&Itemid=274&lang=en|access-date=7 May 2012|archive-date=27 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927160139/http://www.sdau.edu.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=289&Itemid=274&lang=en|url-status=dead}}</ref>
