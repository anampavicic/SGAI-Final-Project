[[Gita Press]], the world's largest publisher of [[Hindu religious texts]] like [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], has been established here since 1926.{{efn|name=fn1|''Gita press was initially formed in 1923 and started publishing only since 1927''}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Gita Press {{!}} Hindu publishing organization |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1547777/Gita-Press |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=11 August 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Verma |first=Lalmani |date=28 July 2022 |title=A century old, how Gita Press came to be 'leading purveyor of print Hinduism' |work=The Indian Express |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/how-gita-press-came-to-be-leading-purveyor-of-print-hinduism-8002943/ |access-date=20 October 2022}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Gorakhpur" comes from the Sanskrit ''Gorakshapuram'', which means abode of [[Gorakhnath|Gorakshanatha]], a renowned ascetic who was a prominent saint of the ''[[Nath|Nath Sampradaya]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=History – Origin of Name|url=http://gorakhpur.nic.in/history|website=gorakhpur.nic.in|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="Mallison railway museum_2011_p407-428">{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/17972/1/Nath%20Sampradaya.FP.pdf|title=Mallinson, James (2011) 'Nāth Saṃpradāya.' In: Brill Encyclopedia of Hinduism Vol. 3. Brill, pp. 407–428.|access-date=11 January 2020}}</ref>

==History==
The earliest forerunners of the settlement at Gorakhpur were probably "considerably to the north of the present town" because the course of the Rapti was then more to the north and east than it is today; it would have flowed through the present-day city and gone through what is now the Ramgarh Tal.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 235 --> Farmers digging wells in the 1800s/early 1900s would sometimes encounter pieces of old boats, which is indicative of the river's shift in course.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 235 --> The site of Gorakhpur would have been desirable for a human settlement because of its secure location — it is protected on the south and west by the Rapti and Rohin rivers, and in the past there were dense forests on the north and east, offering protection on those sides as well.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 235 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909">{{cite book |editor1-last=Nevill |editor1-first=H. R. |title=Gorakhpur: A Gazetteer, Being Volume XXXI of the District Gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh |date=1909 |publisher=Government Press |location=Allahabad |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.94287 |access-date=30 August 2023}}</ref>{{rp|235}}

The earliest event described in local tradition is the legendary construction of the Mansarowar and Kauladah tanks, in the area now called Purana Gorakhpur, in the 10th century.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 235, 9 --> They are said to have been built by a married couple — Mansarowar is attributed to the husband, the prince Man Sen, while Kauladah is attributed to the wife, Kaulavati.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 235 --> Sometime after that, the area is said to have been ruled by a group known as the Domkatars, who built the [[Domingarh]] fort at the confluence of the Rapti and Rohin rivers.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 235-6 --> Still later, Gorakhpur is said to have been ruled by the Sarnet rajas of [[Satasi]].<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 236 --> Sometime around 1400, a family dispute is said to have prompted one branch of the Satasi dynasty to leave the old stronghold, on the shore of Ramgarh Tal, and move to a new location in what is now Purana Gorakhpur, near the shrine of the renowned ascetic [[Gorakhnath]].<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 236 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|235–6, 239}}

===Mughal period===
In any case, Gorakhpur had become a large town by the time of [[Akbar]], in the late 1500s.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 236 --> The earliest contemporary reference to a Mughal garrison at Gorakhpur is in 1572, when it was governed by Payanda Khan on behalf of [[Munim Khan]], then ''[[subahdar]]'' of [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]].<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 178 --> Gorakhpur was for a long time the main Muslim garrison north of the Ghaghra, which may explain why it has such a prominent Muslim presence compared to other parts of the district.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 235 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|178, 235–6}}

In the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' ({{circa}} 1595), Gorakhpur is listed as the capital of a ''[[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]]'' in the ''[[subah]]'' of [[Awadh]].<!-- Ain-i-Akbari --> ''Sarkar'' Gorakhpur was divided into 24 ''[[mahalla|mahal]]''s, and Gorakhpur itself was one of them.<!-- Ain-i-Akbari --> The ''mahal'' of Gorakhpur was listed with an assessed revenue of 567,385 ''[[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]''s and was expected to supply 200 infantry and 40 cavalry to the Mughal army.<!-- Ain-i-Akbari --> It was described as having a brick fort on the Rapti.<ref name="Ain-i-Akbari">{{cite book |last1=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |author1-link=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |translator-last1=Jarrett |translator-first1=Henry Sullivan |title=The Ain-i-Akbari |date=1891 |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |location=Calcutta |url=https://archive.org/details/ainiakbarivolum00mubgoog |access-date=21 January 2021}}</ref>{{rp|174–5}}

Gorakhpur also had a [[mint (facility)|mint]] under Akbar, issuing copper coins only.<!-- Habib 1982, p. 33 --> By the time of [[Aurangzeb]], the Gorakhpur mint was also issuing silver coins.<!-- Habib 1982, p. 33 --> During the 1600s, based on [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]]'s account of his travels in India, Gorakhpur played an important role as a centre for trade with the northern mountain regions.<ref name="Habib 1982">{{cite book |last1=Habib |first1=Irfan |author1-link=Irfan Habib |title=An Atlas of the Mughal Empire |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195603796 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Buo9AQAAIAAJ |access-date=26 March 2023}}</ref>{{rp|33}}

In the late 1600s, Gorakhpur was officially renamed ''Mu'azzamabad'' in honour of Prince Mu'azzam (the later [[Bahadur Shah I]]), and this name was used in official documents until the British takeover in 1801.<ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|236}}

==Geography==
[[File:Ramgarh Tal Lake, Gorakhpur, 8 Apr 2019.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramgarh Tal Lake]]]]
Gorakhpur is situated about 100&nbsp;km from the [[Nepal]] border, 193&nbsp;km from [[Varanasi]], 260&nbsp;km from [[Patna]] and 270&nbsp;km from [[Lucknow]]. It is one of the flood vulnerable districts in [[Eastern Uttar Pradesh]]. Data over the past 100 years show a considerable increase in the intensity and frequency of floods, with extreme events occurring every three to four years. Roughly 20% of the population is affected by floods, which are an annual occurrence in some areas, causing huge loss of life, health, and livelihoods for the poor inhabitants, as well as damage to public and private property.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/resource/integrating-climate-change-into-disaster-planning-gorakhpur/ Integrating climate change concerns into disaster management planning: The case of Gorakhpur, India] by Shiraz A. Wajih and Shashikant Chopde, the Climate and Environment Knowledge Network, 2014</ref>

Gorakhpur is situated on the bank's of [[West Rapti River|Rapti river]] which is a tributary of Ghagra river. A fairly large lake [[Ramgarh Tal Lake]] is also situated in the eastern part of the city.
