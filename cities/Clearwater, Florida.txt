==History==
Present-day Clearwater was originally the home of the [[Tocobaga]] people. Around 1835, the [[United States Army]] began construction of [[Fort Harrison, Florida|Fort Harrison]], named after [[William Henry Harrison]], as an outpost during the [[Seminole Wars]].<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|title=A History of Clearwater Florida|url=http://cometoclearwater.com/a-history-of-clearwater-florida/|access-date=October 22, 2020|website=cometoclearwater.com|language=en-US}}</ref> The fort was located on a bluff overlooking Clearwater Harbor, which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development called Harbor Oaks. [[University of South Florida]] archaeologists excavated the site in 1962 after Mark Wyllie discovered an underground ammunition bunker while planting a tree in his yard.<ref name="auto2"/>

The area's population grew after the Federal Armed Occupation Act of 1842 offered {{convert|160|acre|km2}} to anyone who would bear arms and cultivate the land.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} City of Clearwater, FL|url=https://www.myclearwater.com/news-info/about-us/history|access-date=October 22, 2020|website=www.myclearwater.com}}</ref> Early settlers included the Stevens, Stevenson, Sever and McMullen families, who claimed and farmed large tracts of land.<ref name="auto1"/> Prior to 1906, the area was known as Clear Water Harbor. The name "Clear Water" is thought to have come from a fresh water spring flowing from near where the old City Hall building was located. There were many other freshwater springs that dotted the bluff, many in the bay or harbor itself.

Originally part of [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], the first road joining Clearwater and Tampa was built in 1849, which dramatically reduced the prior day-long commute between the cities.

[[File:Florida - Brandenton through Clearwater - NARA - 23936571 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Clearwater in 1932]]
During the [[American Civil War]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] gunboats repeatedly raided the community's supplies, as most of the able-bodied men were away fighting for the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].<ref name="auto2"/> The town began developing in the late nineteenth century, prompted by [[Peter Demens]]' completion of [[Orange Belt Railway|the first passenger railroad line into the city]] in 1888. Clearwater was incorporated in 1891, with James E. Crane becoming the first mayor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://clearwaterhistory-nineties.theflaglandbase.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010302025959/http://clearwaterhistory-nineties.theflaglandbase.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 2, 2001|title=Clearwater Roars Into the 1900s- Freedom Magazine Presents The History of Clearwater Part III|website=clearwaterhistory-nineties.theflaglandbase.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> The area's popularity as a vacation destination grew after railroad magnate [[Henry B. Plant]] built a sprawling Victorian resort hotel named [[Belleview Biltmore]] just south of Clearwater in 1897.

By the early 1900s, Clearwater's population had grown to around 400, ballooning to nearly 1,000 in the winter. Clearwater's oldest existing newspaper, the ''Clearwater Sun'', was first published on March 14, 1914.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clearwatersun.org|title=The Clearwater Sun - Smallest of the World's Leading Newspapers|website=www.clearwatersun.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Clearwater was reincorporated, this time as a city, on May 27, 1915, and was designated the county seat for Pinellas County, which broke from Hillsborough County in 1912. In 1915, a bridge was built across Clearwater Harbor, joining the city with [[Clearwater Beach]] to the west. Clearwater Beach, although located on a separate barrier island, belongs to the city of Clearwater and fronts the Gulf of Mexico. A new, much higher bridge now arcs over the bay, replacing the former [[drawbridge]]; the connecting road is part of [[Florida State Road 60|State Road 60]] and is called [[Clearwater Memorial Causeway]].

During [[World War II]], Clearwater became a major training base for US troops destined for Europe and the Pacific. Virtually every hotel in the area, including the Belleview Biltmore and the [[Fort Harrison Hotel]], was used as a barracks for new recruits.<ref name="auto2"/> Vehicle traffic was regularly stopped for companies of soldiers marching through downtown, and nighttime blackouts to confuse potential enemy bombers were common practice. Pre-development Sand Key was used as a target by [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] fighter-bombers for strafing and bombing practice.

===Climate===
Clearwater has a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Clearwater is far enough south that it lies in the broad transition zone from subtropical to tropical climates. As such, Clearwater is mostly warm to hot year round, with few nights of frost. Most of the annual rainfall comes in the wet season (June through September), when daily thundershowers erupt due to the strong solar heating. The dry season starts in October and runs through May, at which time the weather is sunny, dry, and there is little change in daily weather.<ref>[https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/clearwater/florida/united-states/usfl0866 "Climate Clearwater – Florida"].

The theatre was managed by various movie companies (EJ Sparks, Paramount, ABC-Southeastern Theatres, and Plitt Southern) and played the most recent movies of the day. The theatre also offered [[vaudeville]] on Friday nights in the 1930s. Headliners included [[Sally Rand]], [[Fred Stone]] and his daughter, and [[Lum and Abner]] (of radio).<ref name="olddays" /> The theatre was renovated in 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-tAOAAAAIBAJ&pg=3037,4021303&dq=capitol+theater+clearwater|title=St. Petersburg Times - Two more shops open along Cleveland street|website=news.google.com|access-date=June 19, 2016}}</ref> The Morton theatre organ was most likely removed during this renovation. When Plitt Southern did not renew their contract in 1979, Bill Neville and Jerry Strain tried to save the theatre with film classics and reduced prices. However, the theatre closed its doors on October 28, 1980.

Royalty Theater Company signed leases with the Taylor family in February 1981, when it then became known as the Royalty Theater (Clearwater, Florida).

====Clearwater Public Library System====
In 1911, the city of Clearwater witnessed a vast population increase as well as acquiring telephones, electricity, paved streets and an ice factory. It is during this time that the Clearwater Library Association opened a subscription library on the second floor of the local People's Bank. Its popularity and support led to the request of $10,000 from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] to build a [[public library]]. The building was designed by Tampa architect F.J. Kennard. In its first year, the library had over 1,277 visitors and 2,792 books borrowed. As a vacation town, the library provided free access to materials for all residents and winter visitors.<ref name=ClearwaterLibrary>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myclearwater.com/cpl/about/history/|title=Our History: A Century of Service: Checking Out the History of the Clearwater Library|publisher=City of Clearwater, Florida|access-date=June 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614191124/http://www.myclearwater.com/cpl/about/history/|archive-date=June 14, 2016}}</ref>

During the Depression, the Clearwater Public Library faced many of the same threats seen at other libraries seen throughout the United States. This includes increased patron usage and dwindling budget. In the 1940s, the Clearwater library increased its staff from three assistants to five assistants. The library's collection also grew from 18,047 to over 100,000. To account for this increase, the Librarian and Board President Traver Bayly made an appeal to the City Commission for additional space.<ref name=ClearwaterLibrary/>

As a result of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], the Clearwater Public Library was for White patrons only from its founding in 1911 to the mid-twentieth century. In 1950, the City Commission agreed to the building of the North Greenwood library. Designed by Architect Eugene Beach, the new library allowed access for the city's African American population to many information sources. This library was renovated in 1984. The new Main library was rebuilt beginning in 2000. It opened in May 2004.<ref name=ClearwaterLibrary/>

As the population continued to increase throughout the late twentieth century, the library system continued to grow. The Clearwater Public Library System now includes five libraries: Clearwater Main, Countryside, North Greenwood, Beach, and East. In recent years, the Clearwater Public Library System has become increasingly digital, providing patrons with access to computers, online databases, and an online library catalog. This was made possible by the Greater Clearwater Public Library Foundation, Inc. which formed in 1984.<ref name=ClearwaterLibrary/> As a part of the library's Centennial Celebration, a project is commencing to add [[makerspaces]] to the libraries. The Main library's makerspace is the "Studios at Main" and targets creative arts making.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myclearwater.com/cpl/flyers/2016-library-article.pdf |title=Library Launches MakerSpaces |access-date=August 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806151430/http://www.myclearwater.com/cpl/flyers/2016-library-article.pdf |archive-date=August 6, 2016  |page=9}}</ref>

==== Clearwater Marine Aquarium ====
The [[Clearwater Marine Aquarium]] is a small non-profit [[Public aquarium|aquarium]]. Opening in 1972 on Clearwater Beach, the aquarium is most famous for Winter the dolphin. Rescued as a calf in 2005, Winter was one of the first dolphins to have been fitted with a prosthetic tail after losing it due to entanglement in a crab trap. The aquarium is also home to other dolphins, otters, pelicans, nurse sharks, and turtles among several species of fish and other marine life. CMA also assists in animal strandings and other emergencies regarding sea life. Animals that have stranded are rehabilitated, and if possible, released back into the wild once they have made a full recovery. It has been featured as the main setting of the American family movie series ''[[Dolphin Tale]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dolphin Tale Set|url=https://www.cmaquarium.org/winters-inspiration/dolphin-tale/|access-date=October 22, 2020|website=Clearwater Marine Aquarium|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Church of Scientology==
{{see also|Flag Land Base}}

The [[Church of Scientology]]'s "spiritual headquarters" are located in downtown Clearwater. The Church refers to Clearwater as its "Flag Land Base".<ref name=TampaBayTimes/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/churches/flag-land-base.html|title=Official Church of Scientology Video: Religious Mecca, Flag Land Base|website=www.scientology.org|access-date=June 19, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Scientology Clearwater headquarters.JPG|thumb|The [[Church of Scientology]]'s Clearwater headquarters, the [[Super Power Building]]]]
The Church of Scientology owns several historical landmark buildings including the [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] and the Clearwater Bank Building. As of 2019, Scientology had purchased so much property in downtown Clearwater that it owned most of the commercial buildings in the downtown core, many of which remained vacant. According to an investigation by the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'', "The [Church of Scientology], its members and companies they control now own 185 properties that cover 101 acres in the center of downtown. Half the properties were bought since January 2017. ...Seventy-three percent of the property is [now] tax-exempt for religious purposes."<ref name="tbt2019">{{multiref2 |1={{cite web |url=https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/ |title=How Scientology doubled its downtown Clearwater footprint in 3 years |first=Tracey |last=McManus |date=October 20, 2019 |website=[[Tampa Bay Times]]}} |2={{cite web |url=https://www.tampabay.com/gallery/2019/10/20/slideshow-all-the-church-of-scientologys-buildings-in-pinellas-county/ |title=Slideshow: All the Church of Scientology's buildings in Pinellas County |first=Tracee |last=Stockwell |date=October 20, 2019 |website=[[Tampa Bay Times]]}} }}</ref> By 2024, the count was up to 210 parcels purchased since 2017, including the office tower where city government offices were located, and leaving only seven remaining commercial property owners who are not associated with Scientology or government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=$58M sale extends Scientologists’ control of downtown Clearwater |url=https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2024/04/04/58m-sale-extends-scientologists-control-downtown-clearwater/ |first=Tracey |last=McManus |date=April 4, 2024 |work=Tampa Bay Times}}</ref>
