==History==
The earliest archaeological deposits recovered at Charsadda, in Bala Hisar, are dated to {{Circa|1400 BCE}}, when a small community was established on a low natural mound of clay above the floodplain of the Kabul and Swat rivers, constructing structures of timber posts slotted into postholes,<ref>Coningham, R.A.E. and C. Batt, 2007. "Dating the Sequence", in R.A.E. Coningham and I. Ali (eds.), ''Charsadda: The British-Pakistani Excavations at the Bala Hisar, Society for South Asian Studies Monograph No. 5'', BAR International Series 1709, Archaeopress, Oxford, p. 97.</ref> in association with ceramic sherds and ash. Subsequent periods indicate that more permanent structures were built at Charsadda, including stone-lined pits. Between the 14th century BCE and the 6th century BCE, when an Achaemenid presence is represented at the site (see below), the inhabitants of Charsadda developed an iron-working industry and used ceramics that are typical for this period in the Vale of Peshawar, Swat and Dir.
The later history of Charsadda can be traced back to the 6th century BCE. It was the capital of Gandhara from the 6th century BCE to the 2nd century CE. The ancient name of Charsadda was [[Pushkalavati]]. The city hosts the ruins of what was once the ancient [[Gandharan]] capital city of [[Pushkalavati]] (meaning Lotus City in Sanskrit), and The father of Sanskrit grammar, [[Pāṇini]] was from this area and lived around 4th century BCE.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peddie |first=Jon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6a8_AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA17 |title=The History of Visual Magic in Computers: How Beautiful Images are Made in CAD, 3D, VR and AR |date=2013-06-13 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4471-4932-3 |page=17 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Pakhtunkhwa">{{cite web|url=http://pakhtunkhwa.com/html/body_nwfp_in_search_of_a_name.html|title=NWFP in search of a name|work=pakhtunkhwa.com|access-date=24 January 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131042427/http://pakhtunkhwa.com/html/body_nwfp_in_search_of_a_name.html|archive-date=31 January 2016}}</ref> Many invaders have ruled over this region during different times of history. These include the [[Maurya Empire]] and the [[Gupta Empire]], [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] Macedonians, the Greco-Bactrians, the [[Indo-Greeks]], the [[Indo-Scythians]], the [[Indo-Parthians]], the [[Kushans]], the [[Indo-Hephthalites|Huns]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Durrani Empire|Durranis]] and more recently the [[British Empire]].

Charsadda is contiguous to the town of [[Prang, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Prang]]; and these two places were identified by [[Alexander Cunningham]] with the ancient Pushkalāvati, capital of the region at the time of Alexander's invasion, and transliterated as Peukelaus or Peukelaotis by the Greek historians. Its chieftain (Astes), according to Arrian, was killed in defence of one of his strongholds after a prolonged siege by Hephaistion. Ptolemy fixes its site upon the eastern bank of the Suastene or Swat. The region was later conquered by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupt Maurya The Great]] from the Macedonian satraps.

The present town of Charsadda is of more recent origin.<ref name="Dani 1963"/>{{rp|2}}

==Rivers==
There are three rivers flowing in Charsadda: the [[River Jindi]], the [[Kabul River]] and the [[Swat River]]; these are the main source of irrigation for Charsadda. The three rivers then merge and join the [[Indus River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/Publications/livingwithdisasters.pdf | author=Noreen Haider|title=Living With Disasters |access-date=2010-06-01| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709085830/http://www.ndma.gov.pk/Publications/livingwithdisasters.pdf|archive-date=9 July 2011}}</ref>

==Administration==
The district is administratively subdivided into three [[tehsil]]s – Charsadda, Tangi, and Shabqadar which contained a total of 49 Union Councils.<ref name="NRB"/>

==Education==
[[Bacha Khan University]] is a public university situated in Charsadda, named after [[Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] (Bacha Khan). In January 2016, the university was [[Bacha Khan University attack|attacked]] by gunmen.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35359072 Pakistan attack: Gunmen kill 19 at Bacha Khan University] BBC</ref>

==Cemetery==
Charsadda's huge cemetery lies south of the tehsil bazaar.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009">{{cite journal |last1=Mohammadzai |first1=Qasim Jan |title=Glimpses of History in the Cemetery of Charsadda (Ancient Pushkalavati) |journal=Ancient Pakistan |date=2009 |volume=XX |url=http://ojs.uop.edu.pk/ancientpakistan/article/download/145/131/259 |access-date=31 March 2023}}</ref>{{rp|191}} It currently occupies an area of 3x4&nbsp;km, but it used to be bigger — a lot of the current town has been built on top of the old cemetery, often illegally.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|191}} Two major roads (the Khushal Khan Khattak and Ali Khan roads) cut across the cemetery from north to south, connecting Charsadda with areas to the south like Prang and Babara.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|191}} Various other roads also cross over the cemetery, connecting other villages and towns.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|191}} Heavy traffic like trucks and trailers use these roads, which causes additional stress on the underlying graves.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|191}}

The age of the cemetery is not known.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|191}} One local tradition holds that [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] originally endowed the land to the locals as a reward for their military support during [[Indian campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani|his Indian campaigns]].<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|191}} Another tradition places it in the 15th century, when there was widespread migration of Pashtun tribes into the Peshawar valley.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} These migrations would have been accompanied by violent conflict, and the battlefields were supposedly seen as unfit for cultivating or living on after they had been "stained with human blood".<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} According to Qasim Jan Mohammadzai, the cemetery likely originated when the local population converted to Islam and thus began to bury their dead close to their villages.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} The site chosen for the cemetery would have originally been communal land, known in Pashtun as ''[[Shamilat]]'', that had previously been used for cattle grazing.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}}

Different clans (''[[Khel (clan)|Khel]]''s) each have different sections of the cemetery to bury their dead in.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} The boundaries between these sections are marked by shallow trenches or brick walls.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} The [[Durrani]] tribe, for example, has their section in the northeast; it is marked off by barbed wire and shaded by tall trees.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} Most of the graves in this section are decorated with marble slabs; many of them belong to the period of Durrani rule.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} There are also separate sections for Christians and [[Ahmadi]]s near the main ''Janazgah'', as well as a separate section for non-locals in the southeastern part of the cemetery.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} In this section, called the Musafirkhana, anyone may bury without needing prior permission.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}}

Although not as large as the [[Makli]] necropolis near [[Thatta]], the Charsadda cemetery has a much higher density of graves.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} Whereas Makli primarily houses the graves of the ruling class and prominent holy men, Charsadda is used mostly by ordinary people.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} That said, there are several prominent saints' tombs at Charsadda, as well as royal Durrani graves from their time in power.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}}

Among the saints' tombs at Charsadda are those of Ghazi Gul Baba, Mullah Shah Alam Baba, Mian Sayed Noor Baba, Baba Sahib (aka Ali bin Yousaf Dalazak), Jhare Baba, and Shaheed Baba.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} These tombs are sites of pilgrimage; annual ''[[urs]]'' are held where thousands of devotees gather at night to hear [[qawwal]]s sung in the saints' honour.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}}

South of the main ''Janazgah'', on the right side of the Ali Khan Baba road, there are two prominent enclosures, each marked off with a brick wall and accessed by a gate on the west side.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} This area is known as the ''Chardewarai''.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} The larger enclosure houses eight tombs of the Ali Khel clan, who were the local rulers at the time of the Durrani hegemony; its gate is ornately decorated.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} The other one has the grave of the 18th-century poet Ali Khan.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} Southwest of these two enclosures is a (now ruined) domed brick mausoleum on a raised platform, said to belong to a holy woman.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} None of these tombs have any inscriptions providing a specific date for their construction.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}}

One of the most distinct features of the Charsadda cemetery is the way its graves are decorated.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} About 90% of the graves are decorated with small black and white stones arranged to form geometric or floral designs.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} This type of decoration is locally known as ''Da Kanro Gulkari'', and the style of grave is known as a ''Hashtnaghri Qabroona'' or a Hashtnaghri grave.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}} Some wealthier people's graves are made of brick or marble, but Hashtnaghri graves remain popular because they are cheaper, quickly made, and durable.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|193}}

Another tradition associated with the Charsadda cemetery is the annual family visits to deceased relatives' graves.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} These take place both on [[Ashura]], when any necessary repairs to the grave are done, and on the first day of [[Eid al-Adha]] celebrations.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}} During the Eid visit, family members arrive early in the morning to recite the ''[[Fatiha]]'' and the ''[[Tilawa]]''; this visit is considered compulsory if the buried person died recently.<ref name="Mohammadzai 2009"/>{{rp|192}}
