Straddling the banks of the river [[Isar]] north of the [[Alps]], Munich is the seat of the Bavarian [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Upper Bavaria]], while being the most densely populated municipality in Germany with 4,500 people per km<sup>2</sup>. Munich is the second-largest city in the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialect area]], after the Austrian capital of [[Vienna]].

The city was first mentioned in 1158. Catholic Munich strongly resisted the [[Reformation]] and was a political point of divergence during the resulting [[Thirty Years' War]], but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant [[Swedes]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ofredsår |last=Englund |first=Peter |publisher=Atlantis |year=1993 |location=Stockholm}}</ref> Once Bavaria was established as the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1806, Munich became a major European centre of arts, [[architecture]], culture and science. In 1918, during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], the ruling [[House of Wittelsbach]], which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was declared. In the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the [[Nazi Party]]. After the Nazis' rise to power, Munich was declared their "Capital of the Movement". The city was heavily bombed during [[World War II]], but has restored most of its old town and boasts nearly 30.000 buildings from before the war all over the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 April 2024 |archive-date=29 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240329165923/https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 |url-status=live }}</ref> Following the war, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of [[Wirtschaftswunder]]. The city hosted the [[1972 Summer Olympics]].

Today, Munich is a global centre of science, technology, finance, [[innovation]], business, and tourism. Munich enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] survey,<ref>{{cite web |title=Quality of Living City Rankings |website=[[Business Insider]] |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/best-cities-in-the-world-mercer-2018-quality-of-living-index-2018-3#2-zurich-switzerland-switzerlands-biggest-commercial-centre-and-the-home-of-the-countrys-famous-financial-industry-zurich-has-everything-needed-for-a-great-quality-of-life-although-it-is-notoriously-expensive-20 |access-date=19 March 2023 |archive-date=19 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230319113221/https://www.businessinsider.com/best-cities-in-the-world-mercer-2018-quality-of-living-index-2018-3#2-zurich-switzerland-switzerlands-biggest-commercial-centre-and-the-home-of-the-countrys-famous-financial-industry-zurich-has-everything-needed-for-a-great-quality-of-life-although-it-is-notoriously-expensive-20 |url-status=live}}</ref> and being rated the world's most liveable city by the [[Most livable cities in the world#Monocle's Quality of Life Survey|Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Munich Named The Most Livable City In The World |magazine=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2018/06/25/monocle-most-livable-city-quality-life-survey-2018-munich/#5e1cb4886153 |date=25 June 2018 |access-date=2 July 2018 |archive-date=3 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703022046/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2018/06/25/monocle-most-livable-city-quality-life-survey-2018-munich/#5e1cb4886153 |url-status=live}}</ref> Munich is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in Germany in terms of real estate prices and rental costs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wille |first=Robin |date=15 July 2021 |title=Immobilien: Das sind die 10 teuersten Städte in Deutschland |url=https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/immobilien-das-sind-die-10-teuersten-staedte-in-deutschland/ |access-date=16 April 2022 |website=Business Insider |language=de-DE |archive-date=16 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220416201254/https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/immobilien-das-sind-die-10-teuersten-staedte-in-deutschland/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Die 10 teuersten Städte Deutschlands 2020 |url=https://www.haus.de/geld-recht/teuerste-stadt-deutschland-29992 |access-date=16 April 2022 |website=www.haus.de |language=de |archive-date=18 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220418231306/https://www.haus.de/geld-recht/teuerste-stadt-deutschland-29992 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Etymology===
Munich was a tiny 8th-century [[friar]] settlement, which was named ''zu den Munichen'' ("to the monks"). The Old High German ''Muniche'' served as the basis for the modern German city name ''München''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Everett-Heath |first=John |title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2019 |isbn=9780192602541}}</ref>

===Prehistory===
The river [[Isar]] was a prehistoric [[trade route]] and in the [[Bronze Age]] Munich was among the largest [[raft|raft port]]s in Europe.<ref name="Bernan Associates UNESCO">{{cite book |title=River Culture: Life as a dance to the rhythm of the waters |publisher=Bernan Associates UNESCO |year=2023 |page=616 |isbn=9789231005404}}</ref> Bronze Age settlements up to four millennia old have been discovered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/landkreismuenchen/feldkirchen-bauma-ausgabrung-1.5643281 |title=Feldkirchen: Bronzezeit-Funde auf dem Bauma-Parkplatz |date=23 August 2022 |access-date=27 March 2023 |archive-date=27 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327202314/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/landkreismuenchen/feldkirchen-bauma-ausgabrung-1.5643281 |url-status=live}}</ref> Evidence of [[Celt]]ic settlements from the [[Iron Age]] have been discovered in areas around [[Ramersdorf-Perlach]].<ref>Klaus Schwarz: Atlas der spätkeltischen Viereckschanzen Bayerns – Pläne und Karten.

===Roman period===
The ancient Roman road Via Julia, which connected [[Augsburg]] and [[Salzburg]], crossed over the Isar south of Munich, at the towns of [[Baierbrunn]] and [[Gauting]].<ref>Wolfgang Krämer: Geschichte der Gemeinde Gauting einschließlich der Hofmarken Fußberg und Königswiesen nebst Grubmühle, Reismühle und Gemeinde Stockdorf sowie der Schwaigen Kreuzing und Pentenried.

===Post-Roman settlements===
Starting in the 6th century, the [[Baiuvarii]] populated the area around what is now modern Munich, such as in Johanneskirchen, Feldmoching, Bogenhausen and Pasing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/muenchen/stadtviertel/sensationsfund-die-ueberreste-der-ersten-pasinger-art-536059 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211021/https://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/muenchen/stadtviertel/sensationsfund-die-ueberreste-der-ersten-pasinger-art-536059 |archive-date=21 October 2021 |title=Sensationsfund: Die Überreste der ersten Pasinger |date=17 June 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeologie-muenchen.de/de/archaeologie-in-muenchen/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211021/http://www.archaeologie-muenchen.de/de/archaeologie-in-muenchen/ |archive-date=21 October 2021 |title=Archäologie in München – Archäologische Staatssammlung München}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The first known Christian church was built ca. 815 in Fröttmanning.<ref>Bernd Meier, Ludwig Maile: Heilig Kreuz Fröttmaning 815–1990.

===Origin of medieval town===

[[File:Stadtansicht 1572.jpg|thumb|left|Munich in the 16th century]]
[[File:Muenchen merian.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Munich in 1642]]
The first medieval bridges across the river Isar were located in current city areas of Munich and [[Landshut]].<ref name="Bernan Associates UNESCO"/> The Duke of Saxony and Bavaria [[Henry the Lion]] founded the town of Munich in his territory to control the [[salt trade]], after having burned down the town of Föhring and its bridges over the Isar.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Don't Call It Sprawl: Metropolitan Structure in the 21st Century |author1= William T.

Henry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home somewhat upstream at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbrücke is now located.<ref>Peter Klimesch: Münchner Isarinseln – Geschichte, Gegenwart und Zukunft.

[[Otto of Freising]] protested to his nephew, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick Barbarosa]] (d. 1190). However, on 14 June 1158, in [[Augsburg]], the conflict was settled in favor of Duke Henry. The ''[[Augsburg Arbitration]]'' mentions the name of the location in dispute as ''forum apud Munichen''. Although Bishop Otto had lost his bridge, the arbiters ordered Duke Henry to pay a third of his income to the Bishop in Freising as compensation.<ref>Wolf-Armin Freiherr von Reitzenstein (2006), "München", Lexikon bayerischer Ortsnamen.

The 14th June 1158 is considered the official founding day of the city of Munich. Archaeological excavations at Marienhof Square (near [[Marienplatz]]) in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn (subway) in 2012 discovered shards of vessels from the 11th century, which prove again that the settlement of Munich must be older than the Augsburg Arbitration of 1158.<ref>Archaeological Showcase at the Münchner Stadtmuseum: Discoveries from the Marienhof excavations (2011/2012). 7 November 2021.</ref><ref>Ausgrabungen und Dokumentation – Vergangenheit aus dem Boden.

In 1175, Munich received city status and fortification. In 1180, after Henry the Lion's fall from grace with Emperor Frederick Barbarosa, including his trial and exile, [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto I Wittelsbach]] became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Bishop of Freising]]. In 1240, Munich was transferred to [[Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto II Wittelsbach]] and in 1255, when the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of [[Upper Bavaria]].

Duke [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]], a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income.

On 13 February 1327, a large fire broke out in Munich that lasted two days and destroyed about a third of the town.<ref>Bayerischer Architekten- und Ingenieurverein (Hrsg.): München und seine Bauten. BoD – Books on Demand, 2012, S. 48/49</ref>

In 1349, the [[Black Death]] ravaged Munich and Bavaria.<ref>Wie die Pest die Münchner dahinraffte – Süddeutsche Zeitung (12. Dezember 2018), 13 December 2018</ref>

The growth of Munich was supplemented by its location on top of a gravel bed, where the Isar branched into [[Munich City Streams]], which in turn provided power for many mills and industries within Munich.

In the 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of [[Gothic art]]s: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] church – the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] – now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.

===Capital of reunited Bavaria===

When Bavaria was reunited in 1506 after a brief [[War of the Succession of Landshut|war]] against the Duchy of [[Bavaria-Landshut|Landshut]], Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} The [[Renaissance]] movement beset Munich and the Bavarian branch of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] under Duke [[Albert V, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht V]] who bolstered their prestige by conjuring up a lineage that reached back to [[classical antiquity]].

The [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] was founded in Munich in 1609. In 1623, during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), Munich became an electoral residence when Duke [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I]] was invested with the [[prince-elector|electoral dignity]], but in 1632 the city was occupied by King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Manual of Dates |date = 1877 |edition=5th |chapter= Munich |author=George Henry Townsend |publisher=Frederick Warne & Co. |hdl = 2027/wu.89097349427?urlappend=%3Bseq=667 |chapter-url= http://hdl.handle.net/2027/wu.89097349427?urlappend=%3Bseq=667 |via=HathiTrust}}</ref>

In 1777 Bavarian lands were inherited by [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Karl Theodor]]. The new duke was disliked by the citizens of Munich for his supposedly enlightened ideas. In 1785 Karl Theodor invited Count Rumford [[Benjamin Thompson]] to take up residency in Munich and implement stringent social reforms. The poor were forced to live in newly built [[workhouses]].

After making an alliance with Napoleonic France, the city became the capital of the new [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1806 with Elector [[Maximillian IV Joseph]] becoming its first king. The state parliament (the ''[[Landtag]]'') and the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|archdiocese of Munich and Freising]] were also located in the city.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The establishment of Bavarian state sovereignty profoundly affected Munich. Munich became the center of a modernizing kingdom, and one of the king's first acts was the [[secularization]] of Bavaria. He had dissolved all [[monasteries]] in 1802 and once crowned, Maximilian Joseph generated state revenues by selling off church lands. While many monasteries were reestablished, Maximilian Joseph I succeeded in controlling the right to brew beer (''Braurecht''). The king handed the brewing monopoly to Munich's wealthiest brewers, who in turn paid substantial taxes on their beer production. In 1807 the king abolished all ordinances that limited the number of apprentices and [[journeymen]] a brewery could employ. Munich's population had swelled and Munich brewers were now free to employ as many workers as they needed to meet the demand.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The City and the Senses: Urban Culture Since 1500 |author1=Alexander Cowan |author2=Jill Steward |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |year=2013 |isbn=9781409479604 |pages=136–137}}</ref> In October 1810 a beer festival was held on the meadows just outside Munich to commemorate the wedding of the crown prince and princess [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]].

The Bavarian state proceeded to take control over the beer market, by regulating all taxes on beer in 1806 and 1811. Brewers and the beer taverns (''Wirtshäuser'') were taxed, and the state also controlled the quality of beer while limiting the [[Competition (economics)|competition]] among breweries.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The City and the Senses: Urban Culture Since 1500 |author1=Alexander Cowan |author2=Jill Steward |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |year=2013 |isbn=9781409479604 |page=140}}</ref> In 1831 the king's government introduced a cost-of-living allowance on beer for lower-ranking civil servants and soldiers.

By the time [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]] became king in 1864, he remained mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside, which is why he is known the world over as the 'fairytale king'. Ludwig II tried to lure [[Richard Wagner]] to Munich, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council. Ludwig II nevertheless generated a windfall for Munich's craft and construction industries. In 1876 Munich hosted the first German Art and Industry Exhibition, which showcased the northern [[Neo-Renaissance]] fashion that came to be the [[German Empire]]'s predominant style.

Munich was chosen as capital for the [[Free State of Bavaria]] and acquired increased responsibility for administering the city itself and the surrounding districts.

Munich and its [[urban sprawl]] emerged as the leading German high tech region during the 1980s and 1990s. The urban economy of Munich became characterized by a dynamic [[labour market]], low unemployment, a growing [[service economy]] and high per capita income.<ref name="Making Competitive Cities"/> Munich is home of the famous [[Nockherberg]] Strong Beer Festival during the Lenten fasting period (usually in March). Its origins go back to the 17th/18th century, but has become popular when the festivities were first televised in the 1980s. The fest includes comical speeches and a mini-musical in which numerous German politicians are parodied by look-alike actors.<ref>Hannes Burger: 350 Jahre Paulaner-Salvator-Thomasbräu AG. 1634–1984.

==Geography==
[[File:Munich by Sentinel-2, 2020-06-12.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo by ESA Sentinel-2]]

===Topography===
Munich lies on the elevated plains of [[Upper Bavaria]], about {{cvt|50|km|0}} north of the northern edge of the [[Alps]], at an altitude of about {{cvt|520|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|ASL]]. The local rivers are the [[Isar]] and the [[Würm]]. Munich is situated in the Northern [[Foothills|Alpine Foreland]]. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile [[flint]] area which is no longer affected by the [[fold (geology)|folding]] processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with [[moraine|morainic]] hills. Between these are fields of [[fluvio-glacial]] out-wash, such as around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the [[Groundwater|ground water]] can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to [[marsh]]es as in the north of Munich.

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], the climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] (''Cfb''), independent of the isotherm but with some [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb'') features like warm to hot summers and cold winters, but without permanent snow cover.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=66801&cityname=Munich,+Bavaria,+Germany&units=metric |title=Munich, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase) |website=Weatherbase |access-date=5 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020130/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=66801&cityname=Munich,+Bavaria,+Germany&units=metric |archive-date=7 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RUfAAAAQBAJ&q=-3+%C2%B0c+snow+cover+continental+climate&pg=PA50 |title=The European Culture Area: A Systematic Geography |last1=Jordan-Bychkov |first1=Terry G. |last2=Jordan |first2=Bella Bychkova |last3=Murphy |first3=Alexander B. |date=28 August 2008 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-0-7425-7906-4 |language=en |access-date=18 November 2020 |archive-date=7 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107040757/https://books.google.com/books?id=0RUfAAAAQBAJ&q=-3+%C2%B0c+snow+cover+continental+climate&pg=PA50 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city centre lies between both climates, while the [[Munich Airport|airport of Munich]] has a [[humid continental climate]]. The warmest month, on average, is July. The coolest is January.

The proximity to the [[Alps]] brings higher volumes of rainfall and consequently greater susceptibility to [[Urban flooding|flood problems]]. Studies of [[climate change adaptation|adaptation to climate change]] and extreme events are carried out; one of them is the Isar Plan of the [[European Union|EU]] Adaptation Climate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/eu-adaptation-policy/covenant-of-mayors/city-profile/munich |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319071718/https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/eu-adaptation-policy/covenant-of-mayors/city-profile/munich |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 March 2018 |title=Munich — Climate-ADAPT |date=19 March 2018 |access-date=5 February 2019}}</ref>

Showers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer. The most precipitation occurs in July, on average. Winter tends to have less precipitation, the least in February.

The higher elevation and proximity to the Alps cause the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of Germany. The Alps affect the city's climate in other ways too; for example, the warm downhill wind from the Alps ([[föhn wind]]), which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter.

Being at the centre of Europe, Munich is subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European cities, especially those further west and south of the Alps.

Munich is near the [[Alps]]. It has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') in the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Annual variation in temperature can be significant, because there are no large bodies of water nearby. The winter in Munich is generally cold and overcast, and some Munich winters have significant snow. January is the coldest month. While winter averages remain only moderately cold, and relatively mild for an elevated inland location of Munich's latitude, [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] from the nearby Alps causes cold air to sink and result in temperatures below {{convert|-15|C|F}}. In Munich the summer is usually pleasantly warm, with daytime temperatures averaging {{convert|25|C|F}}

Munich is subject to active [[convective]] seasons and sometimes damaging events. The Alpine [[Thunderstorm|thunderstorm system]] moves along the mountain range, or detaches, heading east-north-east over the foothills of the Alps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atmospheric Physics: Background, Methods, Trends |author1= Ulrich Schumann |publisher= Springer Berlin Heidelberg | year=2012| isbn=9783642301834| page=102}}</ref>

At Munich's official [[weather station]]s, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are {{cvt|37.5|C|F|0}}, on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and {{cvt|-31.6|C|F|1}}, on 12 February 1929 in the Botanic Garden of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Extremwertetafel2 |title=Extremwertetafel (München-Riem) |website=SKlima.de |access-date=12 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sklima.de/datenbank/monat_extrem.php|title=Extremwertetafel (München-Botanischer Garten)|website=SKlima.de|access-date=12 February 2019}}{{Dead link|date=June 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

====Climate change====
In Munich, the general trend of [[global warming]] with a rise of medium yearly temperatures of about {{convert|1|C-change}} in Germany between 1900 and 2020 can be observed as well. In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20&nbsp;°C ([[tropical night]]s), a change in [[Precipitation|precipitation patterns]], as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy rain, is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change. The city administration decided to support a joint study from its own Referat für Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Meteorological Service]] that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in Munich. With the help of those programs issues regarding [[spatial planning]] and settlement density, the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anpassung an den Klimawandel |url=https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Referat-fuer-Gesundheit-und-Umwelt/Stadtklima/Anpassung_an_Klimawandel.html |publisher=Landeshauptstadt München Redaktion |access-date=22 April 2020 |archive-date=11 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511072529/https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Referat-fuer-Gesundheit-und-Umwelt/Stadtklima/Anpassung_an_Klimawandel.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Government and politics ==
[[File:Bayerische Staatskanzlei Munich 2014 02.jpg|thumb|[[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|Bavarian State Chancellery]]]]
As the capital of Bavaria, Munich is an important political centre for both the state and country as a whole. It is the seat of the [[Landtag of Bavaria]], the [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|State Chancellery]], and all state departments. Several national and international authorities are located in Munich, including the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]], the [[German Patent Office]] and the [[European Patent Office]].

===Mayor===
The current mayor of Munich is [[Dieter Reiter]], he is [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). He was elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2020. Bavaria has been dominated by the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CSU) on a federal, state, and local level since the establishment of the Federal Republic in 1949. The Munich city council is called the Stadtrat.

The most recent mayoral election was held on 15 March 2020, with a runoff held on 29 March, and the results were as follows:

===Subdivisions===
{{Main|Boroughs of Munich}}
[[File:Stadtbezirke Lage in München.png|thumb|Munich's boroughs|left]]

Since the reform of 1992, Munich is divided into 25 administrative [[borough]]s (''Stadtbezirke''). They are subdivided into 105 statistical areas.

[[Allach-Untermenzing]] (23), [[Altstadt-Lehel]] (1), [[Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied]] (22), [[Au-Haidhausen]] (5), [[Berg am Laim]] (14), [[Bogenhausen]] (13), [[Feldmoching-Hasenbergl]] (24), [[Hadern]] (20), [[Laim]] (25), [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]] (2), [[Maxvorstadt]] (3), [[Milbertshofen-Am Hart]] (11), [[Moosach (District of Munich)|Moosach]] (10), [[Neuhausen-Nymphenburg]] (9), [[Obergiesing]] (17), [[Pasing-Obermenzing]] (21), [[Ramersdorf-Perlach]] (16), [[Schwabing-Freimann]] (12), [[Schwabing-West]] (4), [[Schwanthalerhöhe]] (8), [[Sendling]] (6), [[Sendling-Westpark]] (7), [[Thalkirchen-Obersendling-Forstenried-Fürstenried-Solln]] (19), [[Trudering-Riem]] (15), and [[Untergiesing-Harlaching]] (18).

There is no official division into districts. The number of districts is about 50, and if smaller units are counted as well, there are about 90 to 100 (see [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile Münchens#/media/Datei:Karte der Ortsbezeichnungen in München.png|map]]). The three largest districts are [[Schwabing]] in the north (about 110,000 inhabitants), [[Sendling]] in the southwest (about 100,000 inhabitants), and [[Giesing]] in the south (about 80,000 inhabitants).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/germany/munchen/admin/|title=Germany: München (Boroughs and Quarters) – Population Statistics, Charts and Map|website=citypopulation.de|access-date=19 June 2023|archive-date=19 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230619133059/https://www.citypopulation.de/en/germany/munchen/admin/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Old Town===
[[File:Ruffiniblock PettenbeckstrNordseite 2020 n. Renovierung.jpg|thumb|The [[Ruffinihaus]] at [[Rindermarkt]]]]
At the centre of the old town is the [[Marienplatz]] with the [[Old Town Hall, Munich|Old Town Hall]] and the [[New Town Hall, Munich|New Town Hall]]. Its tower contains the [[Rathaus-Glockenspiel]]. The [[St. Peter's Church, Munich|Peterskirche]] is the oldest church of the inner city. Nearby St. Peter, the Gothic hall-church [[Heiliggeistkirche (Munich)|Heiliggeistkirche]] was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the [[Viktualienmarkt]]. Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive; these are the [[Isartor]], the [[Sendlinger Tor]], and the [[Karlstor]]. The Karlstor leads up to the [[Karlsplatz (Stachus)|Stachus]], a square dominated by the [[Justizpalast (Munich)|Justizpalast]] (Palace of Justice).

The [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] serves as the cathedral for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising]]. The nearby [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|Michaelskirche]] is the largest [[renaissance]] church north of the Alps, while the [[Theatine Church, Munich|Theatinerkirche]] is a [[basilica]] in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on southern German [[baroque]] architecture. Its dome dominates the [[Odeonsplatz]].

The large [[Munich Residenz]] complex on the edge of Munich's Old Town now ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Within the {{Lang|de|Residenz|italic=no}} is the splendid [[Cuvilliés Theatre]] and next door is the [[National Theatre Munich]]. Among the mansions that still exist in Munich are the [[Palais Porcia]], the [[Palais Preysing]], the [[Palais Holnstein]] and the [[Prinz-Carl-Palais]]. All mansions are situated close to the {{Lang|de|Residenz|italic=no}}, so is the [[Alter Hof]], the first residence of the [[House of Wittelsbach]].

===Modernist architecture===
Despite Munich being the breeding ground for German [[Jugendstil]], starting with the architect [[Martin Dülfer]], Munich Jugendstil style was quickly submerged as historic trash. While the modernist architect [[Theodor Fischer]] was based in Munich, his influence on Munich underwhelmed. Prior to 1914 the city of Munich was under-industrialized. During the [[Weimar Republic]], the Munich establishment was hostile to [[modernism]]. The TUM professor [[German Bestelmeyer]] favored a conservative style, and [[Jacobus Oud]] was rejected for the post of city building chief. Modernist exceptions include a series of post offices by [[Robert Vorhoelzer]] built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Examples of [[avant-garde]] temporary constructions include the ''Wohnmaschine'' (''Housing Machine'') by [[Robert Vorhoelzer]], as well as the ''Flachdachhaus'' (''Flat Roof House'') by [[Fritz Norkauer]]. [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]], and the [[Kampfbund]] enjoyed particular popularity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Munich and Memory: Architecture, Monuments, and the Legacy of the Third Reich |author1= Gavriel D. Rosenfeld |publisher= University of California Press| year=2000| isbn=9780520923027| page=51}}</ref>

===High rise buildings===
[[File:München Hypohaus September 2017 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hypo-Haus|HVB Tower]] at Arabellapark]]
Several high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the [[Hypo-Haus|HVB Tower]], the [[Arabella High-Rise Building]], the [[Highlight Towers]], [[Uptown Munich]], Münchner Tor and the [[BMW Headquarters]] next to the [[Olympiapark (Munich)|Olympic Park]]. Further high-rise buildings are located in the {{ill|Werksviertel|de}} in [[Berg am Laim]].

===Long-term residential development ===
Munich is subject to a long-term residential development plan that is established by the city administration of Munich. The LaSie ("Langfristige Siedlungsentwicklung") was passed in 2011 in response to the acute housing crisis. LaSie is aligned with the strategic development plan passed for Munich in 1998 ("Perspektive München"). LaSie defines three priorities for the construction of residential housing in Munich. Existing [[housing estate]]s, post-war low-density developments, and the suburban area are subject to [[densification]] ("Nachverdichtung"). Non-residential industrial areas are subject to conservation and will be turned into residential and mixed-use areas. On greenfield sites in the Munich periphery medium and large-scale housing estates are to be built so as to extend Munich's urban center.<ref>{{Cite book| title=The Redundant City: A Multi-Site Enquiry Into Urban Narratives of Conflict and Change | author=Norbert Kling |publisher= transcript Verlag| year=2020| isbn=9783839451144| page=245}}</ref>

==Parks==

[[Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell]] became famous for designing the [[Englischer Garten]] between 1789 and 1807. Besides planning the first public garden in Europe, Sckell also redesigned Baroque gardens as landscape gardens, including the parks of [[Nymphenburg Palace]] and the [[Botanischer Garten München-Nymphenburg]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Changing Landscape of a Utopia | author1= Shmuel Burmil | author2= Ruth Enis|publisher= Wernersche Verlagsgesellschaft| year=2011| isbn=9783884622841| page=143}}</ref>

Other large green spaces are the [[Olympiapark, Munich|Olympiapark]], the [[Westpark (Munich)|Westpark]] and the [[Ostpark (Munich)|Ostpark]]. The city's oldest park is the [[Hofgarten (Munich)|Hofgarten]], near the Residenz, dating back to the 16th century. The site of the largest beer garden in town, the former royal Hirschgarten, was founded in 1780.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Munich also played a significant role in the development of electronic music, with genre pioneer [[Giorgio Moroder]], who invented [[synth]] [[disco]] and [[electronic dance music]], and [[Donna Summer]], one of disco music's most important performers, both living and working in the city. In the late 1990s, [[Electroclash]] was substantially co-invented if not even invented in Munich, when [[DJ Hell]] introduced and assembled international pioneers of this musical genre through his [[International DeeJay Gigolo Records]] label here.<ref name="mjunikdisco"/>

[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908 - Houses in Munich.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky's ''Houses in Munich'' (1908)]]
At the turn of the 20th century [[Schwabing]] was a preeminent cultural metropolis. Schwabing was an epicenter for both literature and the fine arts, with numerous German and non-German artists living there.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Munich Schwabing: the artists' quarter {{!}} simply Munich |url=https://www.munich.travel/en/topics/urban-districts/districts-of-munich/from-artists-and-writers |access-date=11 November 2023 |website=Munich Schwabing: the artists' quarter {{!}} simply Munich |language=en |archive-date=11 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231111205854/https://www.munich.travel/en/topics/urban-districts/districts-of-munich/from-artists-and-writers |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Vladimir Lenin]] authored ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' while living in Schwabing. Central to Schwabing's bohemian scene were ''Künstlerlokale'' (''Artist's Cafés'') like [[Café Stefanie]] or Kabarett [[Simpl (Munich)|Simpl]], whose liberal ways differed fundamentally from Munich's more traditional localities. The Simpl, which survives to this day, was named after Munich's anti-authoritarian satirical magazine ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', founded in 1896 by [[Albert Langen]] and [[Thomas Theodor Heine]], which quickly became an important organ of the ''Schwabinger Bohème''. Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on [[Wilhelminism|Wilhelmine]] German society were the result of countless of collaborative efforts by many of the best visual artists and writers from Munich and elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

In 1971 [[Eckart Witzigmann]] teamed up with a Munich building contractor to finance and open the ''Tantris'' restaurant in Schwabing.

Biedermeier was a synonym for arts, furniture, and the lifestyle of the nonheroic middle class. The Biedermeier era painters [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]], [[Moritz von Schwind]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]] are shown in the [[Neue Pinakothek]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Neue Pinakothek, Munich |editor= Christian Lenz |publisher= Beck| year=2007| isbn= 9783406512728| page=41}}</ref>

In 1971, the [[Filmverlag der Autoren]] was founded, cementing the city's role in the movement's history. Munich served as the location for many of Fassbinder's films, among them ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]''. The Hotel [[Deutsche Eiche]] near Gärtnerplatz was somewhat like a centre of operations for Fassbinder and his "clan" of actors. New German Cinema is considered by far the most important artistic movement in German cinema history since the era of [[German Expressionism]] in the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite news |title=History of film – German Expressionism, Weimar Republic, Nazi Propaganda {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-the-motion-picture/Germany |access-date=1 January 2024 |newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en |archive-date=1 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240101212231/https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-the-motion-picture/Germany |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Delaney |first=Darby |date=29 June 2018 |title=A Beginner's Guide to New German Cinema |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/beginners-guide-to-new-german-cinema/ |access-date=1 January 2024 |website=Film School Rejects |language=en-US |archive-date=1 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240101212231/https://filmschoolrejects.com/beginners-guide-to-new-german-cinema/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:MUC Westend AugustinerbrauereiA.jpg|thumb|[[Augustiner-Bräu|Augustiner brewery]]]]
[[File:Biergarten at Night 2.JPG|thumb|left|Beer garden in Munich]]
Munich is known for its breweries and [[Weissbier]] (''wheat beer''). [[Helles]], a [[pale lager]] with a translucent gold color, is the most popular contemporary Munich beer. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, known as [[Dunkel]], which gets its color from roasted malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with a high alcohol content of 6%–9%. It is dark amber in color and has a heavy malty taste. The beer served at [[Oktoberfest]] is a special type of beer with a higher alcohol content.

Wirtshäuser are traditional Bavarian pubs, many of which also have small outside areas. Biergärten (''[[beer garden]]s'') are a popular fixture in Munich's gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city's culture, and are an overt melting pot for members of all walks of life, regardless of social class. There are many smaller beer gardens, but some beer gardens have thousands of seats. Large beer gardens can be found in the [[Englischer Garten]], on the Nockherberg, and in the Hirschgarten.

There are six main breweries in Munich are [[Augustiner-Bräu]], [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery]], [[Hofbräuhaus]], [[Löwenbräu]], [[Paulaner]], and [[Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu]]. Smaller breweries are becoming more prevalent in Munich.

[[File:S-bahn-muenchen.jpg|thumb|[[Munich S-Bahn|Munich's S-Bahn]] at the [[Munich Marienplatz station|Marienplatz station]]]]
For its urban population of 2.6&nbsp;million people, Munich and its closest suburbs have a comprehensive network of public transport incorporating the [[Munich U-Bahn]], the [[Munich S-Bahn]], trams and buses. The system is supervised by the [[Munich Transport and Tariff Association]] (''Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund''). The [[Munich tramway]] is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city, which has been in operation since 1876. Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines. The average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min.{{citation needed||date=April 2023}}

The extensive network of subway and tram lines assists and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre. The 700m-long Kaufinger Straße, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east–west spine that traverses almost the entire centre. Major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike. These attributes result from applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|filtered permeability]]. Pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire Munich city centre, go through public squares and open spaces for enjoyment. Munich city centre was subject to [[urban planning]] and has a comprehensive model for laying out neighborhoods and districts according to [[grid plan]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=NWC |title=Map of Munich transport: transport zones and public transport of Munich |url=https://munichmap360.com/munich-transport-map |access-date=30 October 2023 |website=munichmap360.com |language=EN |archive-date=30 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231030021317/https://munichmap360.com/munich-transport-map |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Cycling===

[[File:Fahrradschild-bjs210429-02.jpg|thumb|Map of Munich's cycling network]]
Cycling has a strong presence in the city and is recognized as a good alternative. The growing number of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle lanes]] are widely used throughout the year. Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets, although the newer or renovated ones are much easier to tell apart from pavements than older ones. A modern [[Call a Bike|bike hire system]] is available within the area bounded by the ''Mittlerer Ring''.

===Cultural history trails and bicycle routes===
Since 2001, historically interesting places in Munich can be explored via the [[List of cultural history trails in Munich]] (''KulturGeschichtsPfade''). Sign-posted cycle routes are the Outer ''Äußere Radlring'' (outer cycle route) and the ''RadlRing München''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Kulturreferat/Stadtgeschichte/Kulturgeschichtspfade.html |title=Münchens Stadtbezirke entdecken |publisher=Landeshauptstadt München |language=de |access-date=22 October 2020 |archive-date=24 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024195101/https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Kulturreferat/Stadtgeschichte/Kulturgeschichtspfade.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Munich Central Train Station alongside [[München Ost railway station]] are two of the 21 stations in Germany classified by [[Deutsche Bahn]] as a [[German railway station categories|category 1 station]].

The central mainline station is a [[terminal station]] with 32 platforms. The subterranean [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] with 2 platforms and [[Munich U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] stations with 6 platforms are through stations.{{citation needed||date=April 2023}}

Munich is connected to [[Nuremberg]] via [[Ingolstadt]] by the [[Nuremberg–Munich high-speed railway]] and [[Berlin–Munich high-speed railway]].{{citation needed||date=April 2023}}

The old air raid shelter next to platform 11 of Munich Central Train Station was an important distribution point for [[guest worker]]s (''Gastarbeiter'') between 1960 and 1973. At peak more than 1,000 guest workers arrived per day, in total 1.8&nbsp;million guest workers passed through Munich Central Train Station.<ref>{{Cite book |title=We Are All Migrants: A History of Multicultural Germany |author=Jan Plamper |author-link=Jan Plamper |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2023 |isbn=9781009242288 |page=62}}</ref>

[[File:Karte Fernstraßen München.png|thumb|Munich [[Autobahn|motorway]] network]]

Traffic is often very heavy in and around Munich. [[Traffic congestion]] are commonplace at the beginning and end of major Bavarian holidays. There are few "green waves" or [[roundabout]]s, and an abundance of construction sites.{{citation needed||date=April 2023}}

Munich has introduced an [[Traffic and Environmental Zone|environmental zone]] and was among the first German cities to require a [[green sticker]] for vehicles, these are an requirement when entering the city or driving in the wider surrounding area.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Environmental Zone Munich|url= https://www.environmentalbadge.com/environmental-zone-munich/|website= environmentalbadge.com|access-date= 2 April 2023|archive-date= 10 August 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200810154808/https://www.environmentalbadge.com/environmental-zone-munich/|url-status= live}}</ref>

=== Air ===
====Munich International Airport====
[[File:Flughafen turm.png|thumb|[[Munich Airport|Munich International Airport]] (MUC)]]
[[Munich Airport|Franz Josef Strauss International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: MUC, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles de Gaulle]], [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankfurt]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Atatürk International Airport|Istanbul Atatürk]]. It is used by about 46&nbsp;million passengers a year, and lies some {{cvt|30|km|mi|0}} north east of the city centre. It replaced the smaller [[Munich-Riem Airport]] in 1992. The airport can be reached by suburban train lines from the city. From the [[München Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] the journey takes 40–45 minutes. A [[maglev (transport)|magnetic levitation train]] (called [[Transrapid]]), which was to have run at speeds of up to {{cvt|400|km/h|mph|0}} from the central station to the airport in a travel time of 10 minutes, had been approved,<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany to build maglev railway |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7011932.stm |work=BBC News |date=25 September 2007 |access-date=7 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216162151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7011932.stm |archive-date=16 February 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> but was cancelled in March 2008 because of cost escalation and after heavy protests.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3219174,00.html |title=Germany Scraps Transrapid Rail Plans |work=Deutsche Welle |date=27 March 2008 |access-date=27 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328175125/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C2144%2C3219174%2C00.html |archive-date=28 March 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Lufthansa]] opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003.

====Other airports====
In 2008, the Bavarian state government granted a licence to expand Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station located west of Munich, for commercial use. These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local government, including the city of Munich, which took the case to court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merkur-online.de/nachrichten/bayern/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-rolle-rueckwaerts-mm-390304.html |title=Flughafen Oberpfaffenhofen: Rolle rückwärts – Bayern – Aktuelles – merkur-online |date=8 July 2009 |language=de |publisher=Merkur-online.de |access-date=25 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622185526/http://www.merkur-online.de/nachrichten/bayern/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-rolle-rueckwaerts-mm-390304.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, in October 2009, the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-business-jets-willkommen-1.142886 |title=Flughafen Oberpfaffenhofen – Business-Jets willkommen – München |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |access-date=25 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725102101/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-business-jets-willkommen-1.142886 |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite being {{cvt|110|km|0}} from Munich, [[Memmingen Airport]] has been advertised as Airport Munich West. After 2005, passenger traffic of nearby [[Augsburg Airport]] was relocated to Munich Airport, leaving the Augsburg region of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach.
