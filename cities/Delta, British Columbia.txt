'''Delta''' is a city in the [[Lower Mainland]] region of [[British Columbia]], Canada, as part of [[Greater Vancouver]]. Located on the [[Fraser Lowland]] south of [[Fraser River]]'s south [[distributary|arm]], it is bordered by the city of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] on the [[Lulu Island]] to the north, [[New Westminster]] to the northeast, [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] to the east, the [[Boundary Bay]] and the [[America]]n [[pene-exclave]] [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]] to the south, and the [[Strait of Georgia]] to the west.

Encompassing the nearby [[Annacis Island]], [[Deas Island]] and [[Westham Island]], Delta is mostly [[rural]] and officially composed of three distinct communities: [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]], [[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]] and [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]].

==History==
Prior to European settlement, Delta's flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the [[Tsawwassen First Nation]] of the [[Coast Salish]]. The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant [[Francisco de Eliza]] mistook the area for an island and named it "Isla de Cepeda". The first European settler in Delta was James Kennedy who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became Annieville in February 1860. Thomas and [[William Henry Ladner|William Ladner]], began farming the area named after them in 1868. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades. In 1879, the area was incorporated as a municipality, named "the Corporation of Delta", and the village of Ladner was made as its administrative centre.

Due to its geography, Delta was a relatively isolated community. The completion of the [[George Massey Tunnel]] in 1959 linking Ladner to [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and [[Vancouver]] along with the opening, in 1960, of the [[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal]] and the [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] being rerouted from the King George Highway in Surrey in 1962 to a new route through Delta, ended Delta's isolation and resulted in a massive 400% population growth over the next 20 years. The 1986 completion of the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] connecting [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] to [[New Westminster]] and Vancouver also helped Delta's growth.

On 22 September 2017, at the request of Delta's council, the [[British Columbia#Government and politics|Government of British Columbia]] changed the name and classification of the Corporation of Delta to the City of Delta.<ref name=citystatus>{{cite web |publisher=Province of British Columbia |url=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0362_2017 |title=Order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council |date=September 22, 2017 |access-date=April 12, 2019 |archive-date=19 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019055128/http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0362_2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Neighbourhoods==
Delta comprises three distinct, geographically separate communities:
*[[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] (pop: 51,623) is home to over half of Delta's population. It is a largely suburban area in north-east Delta bordered by the [[Burns Bog]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].
*[[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]] (pop: 21,112) is a 19th-century fishing village in northwest Delta that has expanded into a suburb. Fishing and farming are important industries. Ladner Trunk Road is its main street.
*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]] (pop: 20,933) is a suburban community in the southwest Delta that calls itself the sunniest place in [[Metro Vancouver]]. Luxury waterfront homes line Tsawwassen's coast. Tsawwassen is also home to the busy Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal which links the mainland to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. Tsawwassen, together with Ladner are also known as South Delta.

==Geography==

[[File:Deas Island in fall.JPG|thumb|left|A trail on Deas Island in late September]]

Delta is located {{cvt|27|km}} south of Vancouver and {{cvt|22|km}} north of the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] at Peace Arch, Surrey. It is bordered by water on three sides: The [[Fraser River]] to the north, the [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia Strait]] to the west and [[Boundary Bay]] to the south. At {{cvt|364|km2}}, Delta is the largest municipality in the GVRD; the second largest is its neighbour to the east, [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], at {{cvt|317.4|km2}}.

Delta's flat, fertile land has made it one of the most important agricultural areas in [[Greater Vancouver]]. The [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] regulations preserve most of this land for agricultural use, preventing its conversion to suburban housing. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is also home to the [[Burns Bog]], {{cvt|40|km2}} of natural [[wetland]]s that are important for wildlife.

Delta includes [[Annacis Island]], an industrial island reached via the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], which connects Delta with [[Richmond, BC|Richmond]] and [[New Westminster]]. Delta also includes a peninsula on the east side of the Fraser River at Delta's northern city limits, which is only accessible via [[Surrey, BC|Surrey]].

===Climate===
Delta is known for its relatively dry and sunny climate compared with other locations in [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]]. For example, it receives nearly 40% ({{cvt|927.5|mm}} from 1981 to 2010<ref name="1102425CCN"/>) less precipitation than [[downtown Vancouver]] ({{cvt|1474.9|mm}} at Vancouver Harbour CS from 1971 to 2000)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=vancouver+harbour&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=888&dispBack=1 |title=Canadian Climate Normals 1971–2000 Station Data - Vancouver Harbour CS |date=27 June 2024 |publisher=[[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] |access-date=16 September 2024 |archive-date=6 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211106214503/https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=Vancouver+Harbour&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=888&dispBack=1 |url-status=live}}</ref> and just over half of that of [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]] ({{cvt|1805.6|mm}} at North Vancouver 2nd Narrows from 1981 to 2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=n+vancouver&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=830&dispBack=0 |title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 Station Data - N Vancouver 2nd Narrows |date=27 June 2024 |publisher=[[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] |access-date=16 September 2024}}</ref> It has a warm-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen ''Csb'') with cooler summers and milder winters than other areas on the Canada–U.S. border, and features some of the mildest winters and lowest [[diurnal temperature variation]] in Canada.

==Government and politics==
Delta is governed by the Delta City Council, led by a Mayor and six Councillors, elected for four-year terms, and there is also an elected [[school board]]. The current mayor is George Harvie. Unlike most communities in Canada, but like [[Vancouver]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], Delta has a system of locally based [[Slate (elections)|election slates]] such as TriDelta, IDEA, One Delta, Delta Residents Association, Delta Connect, DIVA, Independents Working For You, and Achieving For Delta.

In the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Delta is part of the [[Delta (federal electoral district)|Delta electoral district]]. As of the 2015 Federal general election, Delta's seat is held by [[Carla Qualtrough]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. In the [[2017_British_Columbia_general_election|2017 provincial general election]], the North Delta seat went to [[Ravi Kahlon]] of the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] while the South Delta seat went to [[Ian Paton (politician)|Ian Paton]] of [[BC United]]. 

Delta, unlike most Lower Mainland municipalities, has its [[Delta Police Department|own police department]].

Former Delta mayor [[Lois Jackson]] served from 1999 to 2018 and since 1973 has had a seat on the Delta Council. Jackson was elected to council again in 2018.

==Power==
In Delta is [[BC Hydro|BC Hydro's]] Arnott Substation, the mainland terminal of the southern AC transmission connections providing power to Vancouver Island, and the former converter station for the [[HVDC Vancouver Island]] circuits.

==Transportation==
[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge 02.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] links Delta to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond.]]

*Public transportation in Delta is a bus system provided by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]]. There is no rapid transit system in Delta, though the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] comes within {{cvt|3|km}} of the city's borders.
*Delta is a major transportation hub for the Lower Mainland. Most vehicles leaving Vancouver for the United States pass through Delta's borders. Many vehicles destined for Vancouver Island use the Tsawwassen ferry terminal in Delta.
*[[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] links [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] to Delta via the [[George Massey Tunnel]], built in 1959. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is linked to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond by [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] and the massive [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] (opened in 1986). Delta is linked to Surrey, [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]], and all points eastward by [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]]. Traffic congestion during rush hour is quite common, although improvements are being made to Highway 91 interchanges at 72 Ave to remove a traffic light as well as the ramps from Nordel Way. 
*[[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]] in Delta provides a connection to the [[Tsawwassen ferry terminal|Tsawwassen]] [[BC Ferries|B.C. Ferry]] terminal, which provides car ferry connections to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. In December 2013, north of the current junction with Deltaport Way, Highway 17 will be rerouted upon completion of the "South Fraser Perimeter Road", and will primarily run parallel to River Road through Tilbury and North Delta to all points east. The remaining stretch of Highway 17 north of that point will be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 17A|Highway 17A]].
*River Road is also another connector through the municipality. River Road starts in Surrey and heads westbound through North Delta, under the Alex Fraser Bridge, north of Burns Bog, and then terminates at 62B Street, which then turns into Highway 17A.
*Like River Road, the western communities of "South Delta" (Ladner and Tsawwassen) are linked to North Delta and communities to the east by Ladner Trunk Road; east of its crossover of Highway 91, the road becomes Highway 10.
*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|56th Street]] is another major artery in the community, bisecting the Tsawwassen region; it is the only road leading into the community of [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], south of the Canada–US border.
*Delta is also home to [[Boundary Bay Airport]], [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|Canada's seventh busiest airport by aircraft movements]]. Boundary Bay Airport is primarily used for private aircraft, commercial charters, and flying lessons.

[[File:TourdeDeltaAD.jpg|thumb|[[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|Tour de Delta]] wall cover on electrical box outside of Delta, British Columbia municipal hall]] Delta's unique and varying terrain provides a challenging test for many of the world's best cyclists in the Tour de Delta (one-day races, for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|men]] since 2001, and for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (women's race)|women]] since 2011). Since its first event in 2001, the Tour de Delta has grown to be Canada's largest cycling event, held annually in July as part of BC Superweek.
The Delta Triathlon is also a very popular event, selling out each year in April. The event takes place in Ladner from the Ladner Leisure Centre. Over 500 participants take part, including many from the local South Delta Triathlon Club.
