'''Jos''' {{IPAc-en|'|dʒ|ɔː|s}} is a city in the North-Central region of [[Nigeria]]. The city has a population of about 900,000 residents based on the 2006 [[census]].<ref name="nigerianstat.gov.ng">{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/nbsapps/Connections/Pop2006.pdf |title=FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA : 2006 Population Census |access-date=22 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305101910/http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/nbsapps/Connections/Pop2006.pdf |archive-date=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> Popularly called "'''J-Town'''",<ref>{{Cite web |title=j-town |url=http://naijalingo.com/words/j-town |access-date=2024-07-05 |website=naijalingo.com}}</ref> it is the administrative capital and largest city of [[Plateau State]]. The city is situated on the Jos [[plateau]] which is embedded in the [[Guinea Savannah]] of North-Central Nigeria. It connects most of the North-Eastern capitals to the [[Federal Capital Territory]] [[Abuja]], by road. Driving in and out of Jos, traffic encounters very steep sloppy bends and mountainous sceneries typical of the plateau landform. The name of the state ([[Plateau State]]) was coined from its affiliation to this landform.

During [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonial rule]], Jos became an important centre for [[Tin|tin mining]] when the colonialists discovered huge deposits of [[cassiterite]], the main ore for the metal. It is also the trading hub of the state as commercial activities are steadily increasing.

==History==
The earliest known settlers of the land that would come to be known as Nigeria were the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] ({{circa|1000}} BC), skilled artisans from around the Jos area who mysteriously vanished in the late first millennium.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nok culture {{!}} Iron Age culture|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nok-culture|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref>

[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-62-74.jpg|thumb|left|Early British settlement in Jos, 1905]]
According to the historian Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt,<ref>History of Jos and political development of Nigeria; Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt</ref> the area known as Jos today was inhabited by [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic groups of Nigeria|ethnic groups]] who were mostly farmers. During the [[British colonial period]], direct rule was introduced for the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau since they were not under the [[Fulani]] [[emirate]]s where indirect rule was used.<ref>Billy J. Dudley. Parties and politics in Northern Nigeria</ref> According to the historian Samuel N Nwabara,<ref>Samuel N Nwabara; The Fulani conquest and the rule of the Hausa kingdom of Northern Nigeria (1804–1900){{Page needed|date=May 2014}}</ref> the [[Fula people|Fulani]] empire controlled most of [[northern Nigeria]], except the Plateau province and the [[Berom people|Berom]], [[Ngas language|Ngas]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] and [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic groups. It was the discovery of [[tin]] by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] from the north, southeastern [[Igbo people|Igbo]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] from the country's southwest. As such, Jos is often recognised as a cosmopolitan Nigerian city.

According to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1894 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was ''Gwosh'' in the [[Izere language]] (spoken by the [[Afusari]], the first settlers in the area), which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], who arrived there after, wrongly pronounced Gwosh as "Jos" and it stuck.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Presswire |first=The New Gong |date=2017-05-20 |title=Jos, a city inspired by tin |url=https://thingsnigeria.com/2017/05/20/jos-a-city-inspired-by-tin/ |access-date=2024-07-05 |website=Things Nigeria |language=en}}</ref> Another version was that "Jos" came from the word "Jasad" meaning body in [[Arabic]]. To distinguish it from the hilltops, it was called "Jas", which was mispronounced by the British as "Jos". It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast [[tin]] deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and [[columbite]] were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both [[Port Harcourt]] and [[Lagos]] on the coast, and then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as "Tin City". It was made capital of [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1967 and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975. Jos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining has led to the influx of [[Human migration|migrant]]s (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This "melting pot" of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, [[Plateau State]] is known in Nigeria as the "home of peace and tourism".

Excellent footage of Jos in 1936 including the tin mines, local people and the colonial population is held by the [[Cinema Museum (London)|Cinema Museum]] in [[London]] [ref HM0172]. 

==Political divisions==
[[File:Nasco Corporate Headquarters.jpg|thumb|The Nasco corporate headquarters is in Jos]]
The city is divided into 2 local government areas of [[Jos North]] and [[Jos South]]. The city proper lies between Jos North and parts of Jos South headquartered in Bukuru. 

;Jos-North

The Local Government Council administration is headquartered here. Jos North is the commercial nerve centre of the state as it houses the state's branch of Nigeria's Central Bank and the headquarters of the commercial banks are mostly located here as well as the currency exchanges along Ahmadu Bello Way. Moreover all basic and essential services can be found in Jos North from the Jos Main market (terminus) to the Kabong or Rukuba Road satellite market.  Due to the recent communal clashes, however, a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos South. The Gbong Gwom Jos palace and office is located in an area in Jos North called ''Jishe'' in the Berom language. In 1956, Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth II]] together with her consort [[Prince Philip]] had a weekend stopover to rest at ''Jishe'' known at that time as Tudun Wada cottage during her Nigeria tour.<ref> https://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/queensvisittojos.htm</ref> Jos North has a significant slum.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Madueke |first1=Kingsley L. |title=Mapping the interworkings of state forces, vigilantes, residents, thugs, and armed mobs in the violent slums of Jos, Nigeria |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429504570-15/micro-formations-hybrid-security-governance-ethnic-riots-kingsley-madueke-floris-vermeulen |work=Limited Statehood and Informal Governance in the Middle East and Africa |doi=10.4324/9780429504570-15 |access-date=2022-12-28 |last2=Vermeulen |first2=Floris}}</ref> Jos North is the location of the [[University of Jos]] and its teaching hospital at Laminga & the [[National Commission for Museums and Monuments]]. The Nigerian Film Institute is also located in Jos-North at the British America junction along [[Murtala Muhammed|Murtala Mohammed]] way. Both the [[Evangelical Church of West Africa]] (ECWA) and the [[Church of Christ in Nations]] (COCIN) are headquartered in this part of the metropolis.

;Jos-South

Jos South is the second most populous Local Government Area in Plateau State and has its Council located along Bukuru expressway. Jos South is the seat of the Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the New Government House in Little Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group of companies, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos South also houses prestigious institutions like the [[National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies]] (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the Police Staff College, the [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]] television college and the [[Nigerian Film Corporation]]. Jos South also houses the prestigious National Centre For Remote Sensing. The city has formed an [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] with the town of [[Bukuru]] to form the Jos-Bukuru metropolis (JBM). Jos also is the seat of the famous National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), situated in Vom.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom, Nigeria |url=https://www.intvetvaccnet.co.uk/blog/national-veterinary-research-institute-vom-nigeria |access-date=2022-12-28 |website=IVVN |language=en}}</ref> and the Industrial Training Fund (ITF).

==Geography and climate==
Situated almost at the geographical centre of Nigeria and about {{convert|179|km|mi|abbr=off}} from [[Abuja]], the nation's capital, Jos is linked by road, rail and air to the rest of the country. The city is served by [[Yakubu Gowon Airport]], but its rail connections no longer operate as the only currently operational section of [[Rail transport in Nigeria|Nigeria's rail network]] is the western line from Lagos to [[Kano (city)|Kano]].

At an altitude of {{convert|1,217|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, Jos' climate is closer to temperate than that of the vast majority of Nigeria. Average monthly temperatures range from {{convert|21|-|25|°C}}, and from mid-November to late January, night-time temperatures drop as low as {{convert|7|C}}. Hail sometimes falls during the rainy season because of the cooler temperatures at high altitudes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  These cooler temperatures have, from [[Colonialism|colonial]] times until the present day, made Jos a favourite holiday location for both tourists and [[expatriates]] based in Nigeria.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Jos receives about {{convert|1400|mm|in|0|abbr=off}} of rainfall annually, the [[precipitation]] arising from both convectional and [[orographic precipitation|orographic]] sources, owing to the location of the city on the [[Jos Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iahs.info/redbooks/a281/iahs_281_277.pdf |title=Publications |publisher=Iahs.info |access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref>

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Jos has a [[tropical savanna climate]], abbreviated ''Aw''.<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/46664/ |title=Climate: Jos - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |access-date=2013-11-26 }}</ref>
