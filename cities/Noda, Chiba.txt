==History==
The area around Noda has been inhabited since prehistory, and archaeologists have found ancient [[shell midden]]s in the area. During the late [[Heian period]], the area was controlled by [[Kamakura Gongorō Kagemasa]], and a succession of minor warlords during the [[Sengoku period]]. During the [[Edo period]], Noda developed as a river port, [[shukuba|post town]] on the pilgrimage road to [[Nikko, Tochigi|Nikko]], and a center for the production of [[soy sauce]]. Neighboring Sekiyado was controlled by the [[Later Hōjō clan]] during the Sengoku period, and developed as a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] under [[Sekiyado Domain]], a [[han (administrative division)|feudal han]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Noda and Sekiyado towns were created on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Noda was elevated to city status on May 3, 1950.

Noda is where the [[Fukuda Village Incident]] took place in September, 1923, after the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

On June 6, 2003, the town of Sekiyado (from [[Higashi-Katsushika District, Chiba|Higashikatsushika District]]) was merged into Noda.

==Government==
Noda has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Noda contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Chiba 7th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Noda is a regional commercial center and, due to its proximity, a [[bedroom community]] for nearby Chiba and Tokyo, with 13% of the population commuting daily to Tokyo per the 2010 census. Noda has a mixed economy, with [[Kikkoman]] soy sauce being the most prominent employer. The city has several industrial parks. There is some residual agriculture, primarily of ''[[edamame]]'', for which Noda was historically famous.
