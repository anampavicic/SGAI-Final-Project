'''Changshu''' ({{zh|c=常熟 |p=Chángshú |w=Ch'ang-shu' |l=evergrow}}; [[Suzhounese]]: /d͡ʐan¹³ ʐoʔ²³/)<ref>Spelling variants in older written sources might be Chansu (''e.g.'' ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911) or Chanzu (''e.g.'' ''The New Larned History for Ready Reference'', 1922).</ref> is a [[county-level city]] under the jurisdiction of [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] province, and is part of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. It borders the [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Nantong]] to the northeast across the [[Yangtze River]]. Due to the mild climate and terrain there, it has enjoyed a high level of agricultural civilization since ancient times, and is named after this, for the first character of its name ({{linktext|lang=zh|常}}) means "always, often", while the second ({{linktext|lang=zh|熟}}) means "ripe". The name of the adjacent county-level city of [[Taicang]] means "great granary".

==History==
{{unreferencedsect|date=February 2022}}
Changshu first became an independent [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]] in 540 AD, but in 581 was made subordinate to [[Suzhou]]. It was promoted to seat of a full [[prefecture]] in 1295, was rebuilt and fortified in the 14th century, but in 1370 was reduced again to the level of a county. In the 15th and 16th centuries Changshu was several times attacked by [[Japan]]ese [[Pirate|pirates]].

Changshu has traditionally been a market town for locally produced rice, corn, wheat, tea, and [[mulberry]] leaves, and since the 13th century has been a major [[cotton]]-producing district. Although administratively still a subordinate city to [[Suzhou]], it is a provincial base of [[foreign trade]]. Currently a harbour is being developed on the [[Yangtze River]] near Changshu to service [[Suzhou]] and [[Wuxi]].

==Economy==
The city's major industries include [[textiles]], [[paper]]-making, [[fine chemicals]], [[machinery]], [[steel]] and [[forestry]] products. The city has more than 4,000 textile and [[apparel]] companies with combined annual sales of RMB50 billion. The paper-making industry has attracted more the US$15 billion of FDI. By the end of 2007, this industry exceeded 2.4 million tons.<ref name="china-briefing.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.china-briefing.com/article/the-yangtze-river-delta:-changshu-551.html |title=China Briefing Business Guide: Changshu Economy |access-date=2009-01-19 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204346/http://www.china-briefing.com/article/the-yangtze-river-delta:-changshu-551.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

More than 2,000 foreign enterprises have invested in Changshu including big names such as [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] and [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]]. Of the contracted investment at least one-third has come from [[Taiwan]] – more than 500 Taiwan enterprises have invested more than US$100 million in the city.{{cn|date=February 2022}} [[UPM-Kymmene]] from Finland has been running a paper mill in the city since 1999 and now has an annual capacity of 200,000 tons of coated and 600,000 tons of uncoated [[fine paper]].{{cn|date=February 2022}}
