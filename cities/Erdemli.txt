==Geography==
Erdemli is located between the districts of [[Mezitli]] (to the east) and [[Silifke]] (to the west). In the north, Erdemli is bordered by [[Karaman Province]] and in the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The district extends from the [[Mediterranean]] coastal plain, the largest agricultural area in Mersin Province, to high in the [[Taurus Mountains]] where there is forest, and then a large area (half the land area of the district) is high mountain above the treeline.

Erdemli is a quiet rural district where the people are conservative, and is traditionally a strong base for Turkish nationalism. The local economy is centered around on agriculture. The coastal plain is covered with citrus fruits, bananas, and various fruits and vegetables grown year-round in open fields or in greenhouses. High meadows in the mountains are planted with grain pulses and fruits such as apples, peaches, and cherries. At these altitudes there are also vineyards, olive groves, and fig trees.

This is an attractive forested coastal district, and Erdemli is now attracting investment in infrastructure to develop a tourist industry.

The coast is home to the endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]]. The [[Middle East Technical University]] in [[Ankara]] has an [[Institute of Marine Sciences]] graduate school here, which has a biology group that monitors the seals.

===Climate===
Erdemli has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> with hot, muggy, virtually rainless summers, and mild, rainy winters.
