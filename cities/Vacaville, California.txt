==History==
Prior to European contact, the indigenous [[Patwin]] tribe lived in the area with the Ululato tribelet establishing a chiefdom around the Ululato village in what is now downtown Vacaville along the Ulatis Creek.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ci.vacaville.ca.us/home/showpublisheddocument?id=6557  |title=Cultural resources|website=vacaville.ca.us|access-date=July 23, 2023}}</ref>

In 1880, Leonard Buck created the California Fruit Shipping Association, and the L.W. and F.H. Buck Company, an early company auctioning fruit in the state,<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U96P97P22o8C|title=California Fruit Grower (San Francisco, Calif.)|date=1908|publisher=Brainard N.

Because of Vacaville's flourishing agricultural industry, as well as an increasing number of immigrants coming into the United States, Vacaville had a large Japanese and Chinese population. While their professions varied, many of these Japanese and Chinese worked for the fruit companies in Vacaville.<ref>{{cite news |title=VACAVILLE JAPANESE |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SFC18950618.2.6 |access-date=November 20, 2023 |publisher=San Francisco Call |date=June 18, 1895}}</ref>

It officially became a city in 1892.<ref name=":1" />

In 1968, the [[Vacaville Heritage Council]] was established.

In August 2020, parts of Vacaville were evacuated due to the [[LNU Lightning Complex fires|Hennessey Fire]], which resulted in the burning of over {{convert|315,000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} in five counties, including in Vacaville, where farms and homes were destroyed.<ref name="CALFIRE">{{cite web|title=Hennessey Fire Information|url=https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/17/hennessey-fire/|website=fire.ca.gov|publisher=California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|access-date=August 17, 2020|archive-date=August 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818015057/https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/17/hennessey-fire/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On August 29, 2022, a truck transporting tomatoes crashed on Interstate 80 in Vacaville, injuring four, splattering over 150,000 of the tomatoes onto the eastbound section of the freeway, and significantly delaying eastbound traffic for hours. The peculiarity of the freeway accident subsequently resulted in international news coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62721021.amp |title=Truck spills 150,000 tomatoes causing California crash  |work=[[BBC News]] |date=July 22, 2022 |access-date=August 31, 2022}}</ref>

==Geography==
Vacaville is surrounded by the Vaca Mountains to the south and to the west and the Sacramento Valley to the north and to the east.

A number of [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species]] occur in the Vacaville area. Endangered plants, which have historically occurred in the vernal pool areas in and around Vacaville include ''[[Legenre limosa]]'', ''[[Plagiobothrys hystriculus]]'', ''[[Downingia humilis]]'', Contra Costa goldfields (''[[Lasthenia conjugens]]''), and showy Indian clover (''[[Trifolium amoenum]]'').<ref>''Environmental Assessment for the Green Tree Assessment District'', Earth Metrics Inc Report 7690, City of Vacaville, March 1989</ref>  To this day [[Trifolium amoenum]] can still be found in [[Lagoon Valley Regional Park]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|28.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which 0.74% is covered by water. Excluding the [[Putah South Canal]] and minor local [[stream|creek]]s, the only significant body of water within the city is the {{convert|105|acre|km2|adj=on}} Lagoon Valley Lake.

The unincorporated communities of [[Allendale, Solano County, California|Allendale]] and [[Elmira, California|Elmira]] are generally considered to be part of "greater" Vacaville.

===Climate===
Vacaville has a typical [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'') with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Characteristic of inland California, summers can get quite hot. Autumns are warm in the early part, but quickly cool down as the wet season approaches. Winters can be cool, and often foggy, but are mild compared to other regions. Spring is a rather pleasant season with fairly mild temperatures and not so much rain. The greater majority of precipitation falls in the autumn, winter, and spring, little to none in summer.

The wettest year was 1983 with {{convert|48.9|in|mm}} and the driest year was 2012 with 5.0 inches. The most precipitation in one month was {{convert|19.83|in|mm}} in January 1916. The most precipitation in 24 hours was {{convert|6.10|in|mm}} on February 27, 1940. Snowfall is rare in Vacaville, but light measurable amounts have occurred, including {{convert|2.2|in|mm}} in January 1907 and {{convert|2.0|in|mm}} in December 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca9200|title=VACAVILLE, CALIFORNIA|access-date=October 2, 2014}}</ref>
