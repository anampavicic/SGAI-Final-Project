The city lies at the [[confluence]] of the [[Volga]] and the [[Kazanka (river)|Kazanka]] Rivers, covering an area of {{convert|425.3|km2|abbr=off}}, with a population of over 1.3 million residents,<ref>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref> and up to nearly 2 million residents in the greater [[Kazan metropolitan area|metropolitan area]]. Kazan is the [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|fifth-largest city]] in Russia, being the [[Volga#Biggest cities on the shores of the Volga|most populous city]] on the Volga, as well as within the [[Volga Federal District]].

Historically, Kazan was the capital of the [[Khanate of Kazan]], and was [[Siege of Kazan|conquered]] by [[Ivan the Terrible]] in the 16th century, at which point the city became a part of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. The city was seized (and largely destroyed) during [[Pugachev's Rebellion]] (1773–1775), but was later rebuilt during the reign of [[Catherine the Great]]. In the following centuries, Kazan grew to become a major industrial, cultural and religious centre of Russia. In 1920, after the [[Russian SFSR]] became a part of the [[Soviet Union]], Kazan became the capital of the [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Tatar ASSR). Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Kazan remained the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan.

Kazan is renowned for its vibrant mix of [[Tatar culture|Tatar]] and [[Russian culture|Russian]] cultures.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yausheva |first=Anzhela |date=2017-11-23 |title=Kazan: A vibrant mix of Russian and Tatar cultures |url=http://www.prospektmag.com/2017/11/kazan-vibrant-mix-russian-tatar-cultures/ |access-date=2019-05-30 |website=Prospekt Magazine |language=en-US |archive-date=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530064448/http://www.prospektmag.com/2017/11/kazan-vibrant-mix-russian-tatar-cultures/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2023, 4 million tourists visited Kazan, and [[Kazan Kremlin]], a [[World Heritage Site]], recorded more than 4.5 million visits.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 February 2024 |title=2023 елда Казанга 4 миллионнан артык турист килгән |trans-title=In 2023, more than 4 million tourists came to Kazan |url=https://kzn.ru/meriya/press-tsentr/novosti/bolee-4-millionov-turistov-posetili-kazan-v-2023-godu/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240225180513/https://kzn.ru/meriya/press-tsentr/novosti/bolee-4-millionov-turistov-posetili-kazan-v-2023-godu/ |archive-date=25 February 2024 |access-date=17 June 2024 |website=Kazan |language=tt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Davydova |first=Aleksandra |date=19 February 2024 |title=Казань в 2023 году посетили 4 млн туристов |trans-title=4 million tourists visited Kazan in 2023 |url=https://www.tatar-inform.ru/news/kazan-v-2023-godu-posetili-4-mln-turistov-5936329 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240225174948/https://www.tatar-inform.ru/news/kazan-v-2023-godu-posetili-4-mln-turistov-5936329 |archive-date=25 February 2024 |access-date=17 June 2024 |website=Tatar Inform |language=ru}}</ref> In April 2009, the [[Russian Patent Office]] granted Kazan the right to refer to itself as the "Third Capital of Russia".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-04-03 |title=Kazan officially becomes Russia's Third Capital |url=http://english.pravda.ru/history/03-04-2009/107354-kazan-0/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602114414/http://english.pravda.ru/history/03-04-2009/107354-kazan-0/ |archive-date=2 June 2013 |access-date=26 March 2013 |website=Pravda}}</ref> In 2009, Kazan was chosen as the "sports capital of Russia".<ref name="sportcap">{{Cite web|last=ВАНЯШИНА|first=Дарья|date=2009-12-14|title=Казань - спортивная столица России|url=https://www.kazan.kp.ru/online/news/587131/|access-date=2023-02-10|website=kazan.kp.ru|language=ru}}</ref> Kazan hosted the [[2013 Summer Universiade]], and was one of the host cities of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Etymology==
The term kazan means 'boiler' or 'cauldron' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: каза́н/[[Tatars|Tatar]]: казан) in the [[Tatar language|Tatar]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] languages. The origin of the city and its name is often described as follows: a sorcerer advised the [[Bulgars]] to build a city where, without any fire, a boiler dug into the ground would boil water. As a result, a similar place was founded on the shore of [[Kaban Lakes|Lake Kaban]]. One legend claims that the city was named after the river [[Kazanka (river)|Kazanka]], which was named after the son of a Bulgar governor who dropped a copper cauldron into it.<ref>{{Cite web |title=InTourist Kazan' |url=http://www.intourist.com/Obj.aspx?id=500186&idr=3&ref=&currency=USD |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027141245/http://www.intourist.com/Obj.aspx?id=500186&idr=3&ref=&currency=USD |archive-date=27 October 2012 |access-date=10 August 2012 |website=Legends about Kazan's foundation}}</ref>

An older mention of the name of Kazan is associated with a pot that was drowned in the river, as evidenced by the text:<blockquote>Kazan Tatars got their name from the main city of Kazan - and it is so called from the Tatar word Kazan, the cauldron, which was omitted by the servant of the founder of this city, Khan Altyn Bek, not on purpose, when he scooped water for his master to wash, in the river now called Kazanka. In other respects, according to their own legends, they were not of a special tribe, but descended from the fighters who remained here [in Kazan] on the settlement of different generations and from foreigners attracted to Kazan, but especially [[Nogais|Nogai Tatars]], who all through their union into a single society formed a special people.

According to the official version adopted today, the city was founded more than 1,000 years ago. The estimated date of the urban settlement on the site of Kazan is 1004–1005 AD. The reason for this dating was found during excavations in the Kazan Kremlin – a Czech coin, dated by the Board of [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|St. Wenceslaus]] (presumably, coinage 929–930 years) and the earliest Czech coin, the remains of masonry and wooden city fence, handicrafts and utensils (Hungarian type lining, women's beads, etc.), as well as other artifacts with less obvious dating. According to official statements, experts from 20 cities of Russia and 22 countries of the world were involved in the study of findings related to the age of Kazan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ярмила Хаскова |year=1999 |script-title=ru:Древнечешская монета из Казани |url=http://www.archive.gov.tatarstan.ru/magazine/go/anonymous/main/?path=mg:/numbers/1999_1_2/03/03_2/ |url-status=dead |language=ru |edition=Гасырлар авазы / Эхо веков |issue=1/2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310151443/http://www.archive.gov.tatarstan.ru/magazine/go/anonymous/main/?path=mg%3A%2Fnumbers%2F1999_1_2%2F03%2F03_2%2F |archive-date=10 March 2016 |access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ru:Кто сказал, что Казани – 1000 лет?

Kazan was a border post between [[Volga Bulgaria]] and two [[Finno-Ugric peoples]]—the [[Mari people|Mari]] and [[Udmurt people|Udmurt]]. Another question is where the citadel was built originally. Archaeological explorations have produced evidence of urban settlement in three parts of the modern city: in the [[Kazan Kremlin|Kremlin]]; in Bişbalta at the site of the modern Zilantaw monastery; and near the [[Kaban Lakes|Kaban lake]]. The oldest of these seems to be the Kremlin.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

After the [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria|Mongols ravaged the Bolğar and Bilär territories]] in the 13th century, the surviving Bulgars recovered in numbers and a small number of [[Kipchaks]] were assimilated from which they adopted their language (the so-called Bulgarism), or Kipchaks and Bulgars mixed to create a modern Kazan-Tatar population. Some Tatars also went to Lithuania, brought by Vytautas the great. Kazan became the center of the Principality, which was dependent on The Golden Horde. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Kazan was growing, becoming an important trade and political center within the [[Golden Horde]]. The growth of the city was also promoted by the successful geographical location at the intersection of major trade routes connecting East and West. During the same period, the minting of currency began with the indication of the place of minting—"Bulgar al-Jadid", that is, a New Bulgar.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Игоревич |first=Бугарчев Алексей |last2=Закиулловна |first2=Сингатуллина Альфира |date=2019 |title=Монеты хана Пулада, выпущенные на монетном дворе Булгар ал-Джадид (по материалам Измериевского клада из фондов национального музея рт) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/monety-hana-pulada-vypuschennye-na-monetnom-dvore-bulgar-al-dzhadid-po-materialam-izmerievskogo-klada-iz-fondov-natsionalnogo-muzeya-rt |journal=Археология евразийских степей |issue=5 |pages=94–98 |issn=2587-6112}}</ref>

In 1438, the Bulgar fortress Kazan (ISKE-Kazan) was captured by the ousted Golden Horde Khan [[Ulugh Muhammad]], who killed the local Prince Swan and moved the fortress to a modern place (according to Russian Chronicles). The city became the capital of the [[Khanate of Kazan]]. The city Bazaar, Taş Ayaq (stone foot) has become the most important shopping center in the region, especially for furniture. Handicraft production also flourished, as the city gained a reputation for its leather and gold products, as well as the wealth of its palaces and mosques. 
Kazan had trade relations with Moscow, Crimea, Turkey, and other regions.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Russian Tsardom period===
[[File:Вид на кафедральный собор. Казань.1894.jpg|thumb|Annunciation Cathedral of Kazan Kremlin, 1561–1562]]

As a result of the [[siege of Kazan]] in 1552, [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsar]] [[Ivan the Terrible]] conquered the city.<ref name="translate.google.ru">{{Cite web |last=ХУДЯКОВ |script-title=ru:Очерки по истории КАЗАНСКОГО ХАНСТВА |url=http://tatarica.narod.ru/cult/library/book/kazanhanligi/chapter4.htm |language=ru}}<br />Google translation: {{Cite web |last=M.G.

[[serving Tatars|Tatars in the Russian service]] were settled in the Tatar Bistäse settlement near the city's wall. Later Tatar merchants and handicraft masters also settled there. During this period, Kazan was largely destroyed as a result of several great fires. After one of them in 1579, the icon ''[[Our Lady of Kazan]]'' was discovered in the city.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

In the early 17th century, at the beginning of the [[Time of Troubles]] in Russia, the Tsardom of Kazan declared independence under the leadership of voyvoda Nikanor Shulgin with the help of the Russian population, but this independence was suppressed by [[Kuzma Minin]] in 1612.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Russian Empire period===
[[File:Kazanmap19century.jpg|thumb|Kazan city map from the 19th century, Russian edition]]
In 1708, the Tsardom of Kazan was abolished, and Kazan became the seat of [[Kazan Governorate]]. After [[Peter the Great]]'s visit, the city became a center of shipbuilding for the [[Caspian fleet]]. The major Russian poet [[Gavrila Derzhavin]] was born in Kazan in 1743, the son of a poor country squire of Tatar ancestry though himself having a thoroughly Russian identity.

Before the building of modern dams, low-lying areas were regularly flooded in April and May. Kazan suffered major fires in 1595, 1672, 1694, 1742, 1749, 1757, 1774, 1815, and 1842.

Kazan was [[Battle of Kazan (1774)|largely destroyed]] in 1774 as a result of [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev's rebellion]], an uprising by border troops and peasants led by the [[Don Cossacks|Don Cossack]] [[ataman]] (Captain) [[Yemelyan Pugachev]], but the city, formerly largely of timber construction, was soon afterwards rebuilt, using stone and according to a grid pattern plan, during the reign of [[Catherine the Great]]. Catherine also decreed that mosques could again be built in Kazan, the first being [[Marjani Mosque]].
[[File:Kazan University, 1832.jpg|thumb|[[Kazan State University]], 1832]]
At the beginning of the 19th century [[Kazan State University]] and printing press were founded by [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. It became an important center for [[Oriental Studies]] in Russia. The [[Qur'an]] was first printed in Kazan in 1801. Kazan became an industrial center and peasants migrated there to join its industrial workforce. In 1875, a [[horse tramway]] appeared; 1899 saw the installation of a [[tram]]way. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Tatars were allowed to revive Kazan as a Tatar cultural center. The first Tatar theater and the first Tatar newspaper appeared.

===Soviet period===
In 1917, Kazan became one of the [[October Revolution|revolution]] centers. In 1918, Kazan was the capital of the [[Idel-Ural State]], which was suppressed by the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] government. In the [[Kazan Operation]] of August 1918, it was briefly occupied by [[Czechoslovak Legions]]. In 1920, Kazan became the center of [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. After the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)]] until 1933, the German and the Russian army operated together the [[Kama tank school]] in Kazan.

During [[World War II]], many industrial plants and factories to the west were relocated in Kazan, making the city a center of the [[military industry]], producing [[tank]]s and [[airplane|planes]]. After the war Kazan consolidated as an industrial and scientific center. In 1979, the city's population reached one million.

===Modern period===

[[File:Kazan, Baumana street - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Bauman Street, Kazan|Bauman street]]]]
In the late 1980s and in the 1990s, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Kazan again became the center of [[Tatar]] culture and identity, and separatist tendencies intensified. With the return of capitalism, Kazan became one of the most important centers of the Russian Federation. The city went from 10th to 8th position in population ranking of Russian cities. In the early 2000s, the city earned the right to host both the [[2013 Summer Universiade]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

'''Millennium of Kazan'''

[[File:Millennium Bridge Kazan.jpg|thumb|Millennium Bridge]]
Since 2000, the city has been undergoing a total renovation.

==Heraldry==
The historical symbol of Kazan is the mythical dragon-like creature [[Zilant]], often mentioned in legends. For example, when numerous snakes and reptiles severely hampered the development of the city, the hunters went in search of the King of snakes and defeated him, according to another version, the residents of the city bought off the giant snake with gold, after which all the snakes left the city. Another legend says that the giant dragon-like serpent always guarded the Khan's treasures, and that it still protects the hidden wealth before the capture of the city in the secret caves. Historically, it is true that snakes were once numerous in the Kazan region, but then their number has decreased dramatically. The first official coat of arms of Kazan was approved on 18 October 1781 and was described as "black snake under the crown of gold, Kazan, red wings, white field". In 1926, the country introduced a ban on such heraldry. In the 1980s, the coat of arms of Kazan began to reappear, and in the 1990s Kazan Zilant in various styles began to appear in print media. Modern graphics of the emblem and flag appeared in 2005—in a silver field on the green earth a black dragon with red wings and tongue, with gold paws, claws and eyes, topped with a gold crown. The shield is crowned with a Kazan cap. According to the traditions of heraldry, the dragon symbolizes power, wisdom and invincibility, the earth—life and wealth, the crown-development, and the cap above the shield-the capital of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kazadmin.narod.ru/gerbs/gerbs.html|title=Гербы Казаи и городов Казанской губерни|website=kazadmin.narod.ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ru:Герб города Казань |url=http://geraldika.ru/symbols/376 |access-date=18 November 2017 |website=Геральдика.ру |publisher=geraldika.ru |language=ru}}</ref>

=== Tram ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
[[File:Kazan tram on Kirovskaya Dike 08-2016 img1.jpg|thumb|An AKSM-843 tram passing by the Kirovskaya Dike]]
Kazan's tram system is one of the oldest tram systems in Russia, opened on 20 November 1899. The tram system in Kazan consists of eight operating routes, one of which is a historical excursion route between the railway station and river port. The daily output is 87 trams. Most of the tram lines are laid along the axis of the main streets, most of them on a dedicated track, fenced with side stones. The tram in the city center was largely removed in the 2000s due to the fight against traffic jams on narrow streets; some routes turned out to be unprofitable after the optimization of the transport scheme in 2006–2007.

In 2009–2020, the reconstruction of tram tracks on the main highways was carried out, as well as the construction of four new tram lines, which made it possible to launch circular tram routes No. 5/5a with an accelerated mode of movement in 2012-2020 along the sections of the Big Kazan Ring.

All trams are equipped with autoinformators, announcements in which are in three languages (Russian, Tatar, English), for this reason announcements are played for a very long time (up to one and a half minutes). The fare is 42 rubles in cash, 38 rubles for an electronic card (2024). On the routes, conductors are involved and, in addition to paying for cash (with a higher fare), there are general civil (with different tariff plans for replenishment, including time passes and an "electronic wallet"), as well as preferential electronic transport cards.

Kazan has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'') with long, cold winters (colder than [[Moscow]]), and warm, sunny summers. As a result of its far inland position, summers are extremely warm for its latitude and winters are quite cold compared to areas further west in [[Europe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The warmest month is July with daily mean temperature near {{convert|20.2|C}}, and the coldest month is January, with a daily mean of {{convert|-10.4|C}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The city set its two hottest days on record during the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves]]. Temperatures reached {{convert|+39|C}} in the hottest days during that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldweatheronline.com/kazan-weather-history/tatarstan/ru.aspx|title = Kazan Historical Weather}}</ref>

===Kremlin===
{{Main|Kazan Kremlin}}
{{unreferenced|date=July 2018|section}}

The city has a citadel (Russian: кремль, tr. kreml', or sometimes Tatar: ''kirman''), which was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000. Major monuments in the Kremlin are the five-domed, six-columned Annunciation Cathedral (1561–62) and the mysterious, formerly leaning [[Söyembikä Tower]], named after the last queen of Kazan and regarded as the city's most conspicuous landmark.

Also of interest are the towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later reconstructed; the [[Qolsharif mosque|Qol-Şarif Mosque]], which has been rebuilt inside the citadel; remains of the Saviour Monastery (a 16th-century cathedral demolished by the Bolsheviks) with the Spasskaya Tower; and the Governor's House (1843–53), designed by [[Konstantin Thon]], now the Palace of the [[President (government title)|President]] of [[Tatarstan]].

Next door, the ornate baroque Sts-Peter-and-Paul's Cathedral on Qawi Nacmi Street and Marcani Mosque on Qayum Nasiri Street date back to the 18th century.

====Towers====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
The Spasskaya Tower was built in two floors by 16th century Pskov architects Ivan Shiryai and Postnik Yakovlev. From the inside, the northern side of the fortress to the Spasskaya Tower adjoined the gate to Spasskaya Church, which has now merged with the tower. The typical Pskovian architectural elements of the facade face the main street of the Kremlin. At the end of the 17th century, instead of three tiers, the tower was built with two brick eight-sided tiers with a brick roof, getting its present, familiar appearance. Until 1917, the tower was crowned with the double-headed coat of arms of the Russian state. In the 18th century, a ringing clock was installed in the upper tier, and even earlier a large bell was moved from a small belfry (now lost, located on the castle wall on the left side of the tower). Until the middle of the 19th century, there was a moat with a stone bridge in front of the tower.

The South-Western Tower was built simultaneously with the Spasskaya tower by Pskov masters and is a classic example of the Pskov style of defensive structures.

The name of the Transfiguration Tower comes from the Transfiguration Monastery of the Savior, which was fenced from the north-west. The tower was also built by Pskov architects Postnik and Barma, but it was significantly rebuilt later, as it has strong traces of the architectural influence of the Moscow defensive architecture. The territory from the Transfiguration Tower to the Spasskaya pass was added to the old Khan's fortress by Pskov masters.

There are unnamed round brick towers, presumably built by Moscow architects in the 17th century.

The Tainitskaya Tower was built in its present form in the 1550s by Postnik Yakovlev. It was named after a secret source from which it was possible to take water during a siege. The entrance to the tower is in the form of a "knee", which increased the defense of the Kremlin. It replaced a tower from the time of the khanate, Nur Ali (in Russian transcription Muraleeva). The 22-year-old Tsar Ivan the Terrible entered the conquered city through the Nur Ali tower.

The North-Eastern Round Tower was demolished after the Pugachev's assault.

The Consistor Tower was built in brick by Moscow architects in the 17th century, its name was given in the 18th century from the Spiritual Consistory located near the tower in the Kremlin. Near the tower, archaeological excavations revealed the so-called Tezitsky (Arabic for "merchant") Moat, which went from the Consistor Tower to the Transfiguration. Archaeologist N. Kalinin and a number of scientists believed that the moat was the southern border of the Khan's fortress.

The Southeast Round Tower is an example of Pskov architecture of the 16th century.

===Bistä, or Posad===
Central Kazan is divided into two districts by the [[Bolaq]] canal and Lake [[Qaban lakes|Qaban]]. The first district (Qazan Bistäse or Kazanskiy Posad), historically Russian, is situated on the hill, the second (İske Tatar Bistäse or Staro-Tatarskaya Sloboda), historically Tatar, is situated between the Bolaq and the Volga. Mosques, such as ''[[Nurullah Mosque|Nurullah]]'', ''[[Soltan]]'', ''[[Bornay Mosque|Bornay]]'', ''[[Äcem]]'', ''[[Marcani Mosque|Märcani]]'', ''[[İske Taş]]'', ''Zäñgär'' are in the Tatar district.

Churches, such as ''Blagoveschenskaya'', ''Varvarinskaya'', ''Nikol'skaya'', ''Tikhvinskaya'', are mostly in the Russian part of the city.

The main city-centre streets are ''[[Baumana Street, Kazan|Bauman]]'', ''[[Kremlyovskaya Street|Kremlyovskaya]]'', ''Dzerzhinsky'', ''Tuqay'', ''[[Pushkin Street, Kazan|Puşkin]]'', ''Butlerov'', ''Gorkiy'', ''Karl Marx'' and ''Märcani''.

===Wooden Kazan===
In the beginning of the 1900s most of Central Kazan was covered by wooden buildings, usually consisting of two floors. There was a historical environment of Kazan citizens, but not the best place to live in. During the Republican program "The liquidation of ramshackle apartments" most of them (unlike other Russian cities), especially in Central Kazan, where the land is not cheap, were destroyed and their population was moved to new areas at the suburb of the city (Azino, Azino-2, Quartal 39). Nearly 100,000 citizens resettled by this programme.

===Other major buildings===
Another significant building in central Kazan is the former "Smolentzev and Shmelev" tea house and hotel, now the Shalyapin Palace Hotel. It is located at 7/80 Universitetskaya Street, at the corner of Universitetskaya and Bauman. A major landmark of late-19th and early-20th century commercial architecture, it consists of two portions. The original portion, built for a merchant named Usmanov in the 1860s, was bought by the inter-related families of Efim Smolentzev and Pavel and Nikolai Shmelev in 1899.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ru:ИЗДАНИЯ ЦБС "Прогулки по городу" |url=http://www.cbs-kazan.ru/izdania-progulki-baumana3.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511090146/http://www.cbs-kazan.ru/izdania-progulki-baumana3.htm |archive-date=11 May 2010 |access-date=20 February 2008 |language=ru}}</ref> They operated a store selling, among other things, tea. In 1910, the Smolentevs and Shmelevs constructed another portion, designed by architect Vasili Trifonov, and operated a hotel there.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ru:До тысячелетия Казани осталось 36 дней.
