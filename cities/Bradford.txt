'''Bradford''' is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England. It became a municipal borough in 1847, received a city charter in 1897 and, since the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 reform]], the [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] has belonged to the larger [[City of Bradford]] [[metropolitan borough]]. It had a population of 349,561 at the [[2011 Census for England and Wales|2011 census]], making it the second-largest subdivision of the [[West Yorkshire Built-up Area]] after [[Leeds]], which is approximately {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} to the east. The borough had a population of {{English district population|GSS=E08000032}}, making it the [[List of English districts by population|{{English district rank|GSS=E08000032}}]] most populous district in England.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the city grew in the 19th century as an international centre of [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacture]], particularly [[wool]]. It was a [[boomtown]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and amongst the earliest [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] settlements, rapidly becoming the "wool capital of the world"; this in turn gave rise to the nicknames "Woolopolis" and "Wool City".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitbradford.com/leisure-attractions/history-of-bradford.asp|title=History of Bradford|publisher=Visit Bradford|access-date=23 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415131739/http://www.visitbradford.com/leisure-attractions/history-of-bradford.asp|archive-date=15 April 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lying in the eastern foothills of the [[Pennines]], the area's access to supplies of coal, iron ore and [[soft water]] facilitated the growth of a manufacturing base, which, as textile manufacture grew, led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment. There is a large amount of listed [[Victorian architecture]] in the city including the grand Italianate [[Bradford City Hall|city hall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bradford.gov.uk/bmdc/the_environment/conservation_and_design/listed_building_descriptions.htm |title=Conservation Areas and Listed Buildings &#124; Descriptions of listed buildings |publisher=Bradford Metropolitan District Council |access-date=10 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222105222/http://www.bradford.gov.uk/bmdc/the_environment/conservation_and_design/listed_building_descriptions.htm |archive-date=22 December 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

From the mid-20th century, [[deindustrialisation]] caused the city's textile sector and industrial base to decline and, since then, it has faced similar economic and social challenges to the rest of [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Northern England]], including poverty, unemployment and social unrest. It is the third-largest economy within the Yorkshire and the Humber region at around £10&nbsp;billion, which is mostly provided by financial and manufacturing industries. It is also a tourist destination, the first [[UNESCO]] [[City of Film]] and it has the [[National Science and Media Museum]], a [[Bradford City Park|city park]], the [[Bradford Alhambra|Alhambra theatre]] and [[Cartwright Hall]]. The city is the [[UK City of Culture]] for 2025 having [[Bradford UK City of Culture 2025|won the designation]] on 31 May 2022.<ref>{{cite news  |url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/20179827.delight-bradford-named-uk-city-culture-2025/|title=Delight as Bradford is named UK City of Culture 2025 |last=Deas |first=Brad |work=The Telegraph and Argus|date=1 June 2022|access-date=7 June 2022}}</ref>

==History==
{{for timeline}}

===Toponymy===
The name Bradford is derived from the [[Old English]] ''brad'' and ''ford'' the broad [[ford (crossing)|ford]] which referred to a crossing of the [[Bradford Beck]] at Church Bank below the site of [[Bradford Cathedral]], around which a settlement grew in Anglo-Saxon times.<ref name="visitbradford.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitbradford.com/leisure-attractions/history-of-bradford.asp |title=History of Bradford |publisher=Visitbradford.com |access-date=2 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924193603/http://www.visitbradford.com/leisure-attractions/history-of-bradford.asp |archive-date=24 September 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It was recorded as "Bradeford" in 1086.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mills|1998|p=49}}</ref>

===Early history===
After an [[uprising]] in 1070, during [[William the Conqueror]]'s [[Harrying of the North]], the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Bradford was laid waste,<ref name="visitbradford.com" /> and is described as such in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086. It then became part of the ''Honour of Pontefract'' given to [[Ilbert de Lacy]] for service to the Conqueror, in whose family the manor remained until 1311.<ref name="visitbradford.com" /> There is evidence of a castle in the time of the Lacys.<ref name=tde>{{cite book |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=Samuel |chapter=Bracknell – Bradford |chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50819#s23 |title=A Topographical Dictionary of England |via=British History Online |pages=326–331 |year=1848 |access-date=3 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026101604/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50819#s23 |archive-date=26 October 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The manor then passed to the [[Earl of Lincoln]], [[John of Gaunt]], [[The Crown]] and, ultimately, private ownership in 1620.<ref name="visitbradford.com" />

By the [[Middle Ages]], Bradford had become a small town centred on Kirkgate, Westgate and Ivegate.<ref name="visitbradford.com" />{{sfn|Sheeran|2005|p=13}} In 1316 there is mention of a [[fulling]] mill, a soke mill where all the manor corn was milled and a market. During the [[Wars of the Roses]] the inhabitants sided with [[House of Lancaster]]. [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] granted the right to hold two annual fairs and from this time the town began to prosper. In the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] Bradford exceeded Leeds as a manufacturing centre.<ref name=tde /> Bradford grew slowly over the next two-hundred years as the [[wool]]len trade gained in prominence.

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] the town was garrisoned for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and in 1642 was unsuccessfully attacked by [[Cavalier|Royalist]] forces from Leeds. [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]] took the command of the garrison and marched to meet the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle]] but was defeated. The Parliamentarians retreated to Bradford and the Royalists set up headquarters at [[Bolling Hall, Bradford|Bolling Hall]] from where the town was besieged leading to its surrender.<ref name=tde /> The Civil War caused a decline in industry but after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in 1689 prosperity began to return.<ref name="visitbradford.com" /> The launch of manufacturing in the early 18th century marked the start of the town's development while new [[canal]] and [[Toll road|turnpike road]] links encouraged trade.

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:Creighton bradford 1835.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Map of Bradford boundaries in 1835.|Bradford Boundaries 1835.]] In 1801, Bradford was a rural [[market town]] of 6,393 people,{{sfn|Sheeran|2005|p=11}} where wool spinning and cloth weaving were carried out in local cottages and farms. Bradford was thus not much bigger than nearby [[Keighley]] (5,745) and was significantly smaller than [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] (8,866) and [[Huddersfield]] (7,268).{{sfn|Sheeran|2005|p=11}} This small town acted as a hub for three nearby townships – [[Manningham, Bradford|Manningham]], [[Bowling and Barkerend|Bowling]] and [[Great Horton|Great]] and [[Little Horton]], which were separated from the town by countryside.{{sfn|Sheeran|2005|p=11}}

[[Blast furnace]]s were established in about 1788 by Hird, Dawson Hardy at [[Low Moor, Bradford|Low Moor]] and iron was worked by the [[Bowling Iron Company]] until about 1900. Yorkshire iron was used for shackles, hooks and piston rods for locomotives, colliery cages and other mining appliances where toughness was required. The [[Low Moor Company]] also made [[pig iron]] and the company employed 1,500 men in 1929.<ref name="GG">{{cite book |title=The Basic Industries of Great Britain by Aberconway: Chapter VI |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/The_Basic_Industries_of_Great_Britain_by_Aberconway:_Chapter_VI#Introduction |publisher=Graces Guide |access-date=26 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502073135/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/The_Basic_Industries_of_Great_Britain_by_Aberconway:_Chapter_VI#Introduction |archive-date=2 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> when the municipal borough of Bradford was created in 1847 there were 46 coal mines within its boundaries.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of [[Bradford Moor Barracks]] in 1844.<ref>White's 1853 Directory & Gazetteer of Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield & Wakefield</ref>

Bradford became a [[municipal borough]] in 1847, and a [[County Borough of Bradford|county borough]] in 1888, making it administratively independent of the [[West Riding County Council]]. It was honoured with city status on the occasion of Queen Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897, with [[Kingston upon Hull]] and [[Nottingham]]. The three had been the largest county boroughs outside the London area without city status.<ref name="beckett">{{cite book | title= City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 | series= Historical urban studies | author= Beckett, J V | year= 2005 | publisher= Ashgate | location= Aldershot | isbn= 0-7546-5067-7 }}</ref> The borough's boundaries were extended to absorb [[Clayton, West Yorkshire|Clayton]] in 1930, and parts of Rawdon, Shipley, Wharfedale and Yeadon urban districts in 1937.<ref name=vision>{{cite vob | url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10220440 | name=Bradford MB/CB | accessdate=13 January 2023 }}</ref>

Bradford had ample supplies of locally mined coal to provide the power that the industry needed. Local [[sandstone]] was an excellent resource for building the mills, and with a population of 182,000 by 1850,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Bradford |title=Bradford – Hutchinson encyclopedia article about Bradford |publisher=Encyclopedia.farlex.com |access-date=2 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606223247/http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Bradford |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> the town grew rapidly as workers were attracted by jobs in the [[textile mill]]s.<ref name="brad.ac.uk" /> A desperate shortage of water in [[Bradford Dale (Yorkshire)|Bradford Dale]] was a serious limitation on industrial expansion and improvement in urban sanitary conditions. In 1854 Bradford Corporation bought the Bradford Water Company<ref>Bradford Corporation (1856) The Acts relating to the Transfer of the Bradford Waterworks to the Corporation of Bradford.</ref> and embarked on a huge engineering programme to bring supplies of soft water from Airedale, Wharfedale and [[Nidd Aqueduct|Nidderdale]].<ref>Cudworth, William (1882) Historical Notes on the Bradford Corporation.</ref> By 1882 water supply had radically improved. Meanwhile, urban expansion took place along the routes out of the city towards the Hortons and Bowling and the townships had become part of a continuous urban area by the late 19th century.{{sfn|Sheeran|2005|p=13}}

A major employer was [[Titus Salt]] who in 1833 took over the running of his father's woollen business specialising in fabrics combining [[alpaca]], [[mohair]], cotton and silk. By 1850 he had five mills. However, because of the polluted environment and squalid conditions for his workers Salt left Bradford and transferred his business to [[Salts Mill]] in [[Saltaire]] in 1850, where in 1853 he began to build the workers' village which has become a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite ODNB |title=Salt, Sir Titus, first baronet (1803–1876) |last=Jamews |first=David |year=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/24565 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24565?docPos=6 |url-access=subscription |access-date=8 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016201926/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24565?docPos=6 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Henry Ripley]] was a younger contemporary of Titus Salt. He was managing partner of Edward Ripley & Son Ltd, which owned the Bowling Dye Works. In 1880 the dye works employed over 1000 people and was said to be the biggest dye works in Europe. Like Salt he was a councillor, JP and Bradford MP who was deeply concerned to improve working class housing conditions. He built the industrial [[Model village]] of [[Ripley Ville]] on a site in [[Broomfields, Bradford|Broomfields]], [[East Bowling]] close to the dye works.

[[File:listermillsbradford.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lister's Mill]]]]
Other major employers were [[Samuel Lister, 1st Baron Masham|Samuel Lister]] and his brother who were worsted [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] and manufacturers at [[Lister Mills|Lister's Mill]] (Manningham Mills). Lister epitomised [[Victorian era|Victorian]] enterprise but it has been suggested that his [[capitalism|capitalist]] attitude made [[trade union]]s necessary.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Masham, Samuel Cunliffe Lister, 1st Baron|volume=17 |page=837}}</ref>
Unprecedented growth created problems with over 200 factory chimneys continually churning out black, sulphurous smoke, Bradford gained the reputation of being the most polluted town in England. There were frequent outbreaks of cholera and typhoid, and only 30% of children born to textile workers reached the age of fifteen. This extreme level of [[Infant mortality|infant]] and youth mortality contributed to a life expectancy for Bradford residents of just over eighteen years, which was one of the lowest in the country.

Like many major cities Bradford has been a destination for immigrants. In the 1840s Bradford's population was significantly increased by migrants from Ireland, particularly rural [[County Mayo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/content/articles/2006/05/12/bradford_irish_katie_feature.shtml|title=Against the odds?|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003020942/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/content/articles/2006/05/12/bradford_irish_katie_feature.shtml|archive-date=3 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[County Sligo]], and by 1851 about 10% of the population were born in Ireland, the largest proportion in [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1111/j.1467-8586.1968.tb00038.x | volume=20|journal=Bulletin of Economic Research|pages=40–57|year = 1968|last1 = Richardson|first1 = C.| title=Irish Settlement in Mid-Nineteenth Century Bradford }}</ref>

[[List of Pals battalions|The Bradford Pals]] were three First World War [[Pals battalion]]s of [[Kitchener's Army]] raised in the city. When the three battalions were taken over by the British Army they were officially named the 16th (1st Bradford), 18th (2nd Bradford), and 20th (Reserve) Battalions, [[The Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/the-prince-of-waless-own-west-yorkshire-regiment/|title=The Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment) – The Long, Long Trail|website=www.longlongtrail.co.uk|access-date=14 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217063029/http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/the-prince-of-waless-own-west-yorkshire-regiment/|archive-date=17 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On the morning of 1 July 1916, the 16th and 18th Battalions left their trenches in Northern France to advance across no man's land. It was the first hour of the [[First day on the Somme|first day of the Battle of the Somme]]. Of the estimated 1,394 men from Bradford and District in the two battalions, 1,060 were either killed or injured during the ill-fated attack on the village of [[Serre-lès-Puisieux]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/tahistory/featuresnostalgiapasttimes/11864363.Badges_tribute_to_Pals_and_City_fans_who_joined_up_and_died_together_in_World_War_One/ |title=Badges tribute to Pals and City fans who joined up and died together in World War One |work=Bradford Telegraph and Argus |date=1 July 1916 |access-date=10 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101443/http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/tahistory/featuresnostalgiapasttimes/11864363.Badges_tribute_to_Pals_and_City_fans_who_joined_up_and_died_together_in_World_War_One/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Recent history===
Bradford's ''[[Telegraph and Argus]]'' newspaper was involved in spearheading the news of the 1936 Abdication Crisis, after the Bishop of Bradford publicly expressed doubts about [[Edward VIII]]'s religious beliefs (see: [[Telegraph & Argus#1936 Abdication Crisis]]).

The textile industry has been in decline throughout the latter part of the 20th century.

==Geography==
Bradford is located at {{coord|53|45|00|N|01|50|00|W|type:city(293000)_region:GB|display=inline}} (53.7500, −1.8333)[[World gazetteer|<sup>1</sup>]]. Topographically, it is located in the eastern foothills of the [[South Pennines]] [[moorland]] region.

Bradford is not built on any substantial body of water but is situated at the junction of three valleys, one of them, that of the [[Bradford Beck]] which rises in [[moorland]] to the west, and is swelled by its tributaries, the Horton Beck, Westbrook, Bowling Beck and Eastbrook. At the site of the original ford, the beck turns north, and flows towards the [[River Aire]] at [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]]. Bradfordale (or Bradforddale) is a name given to this valley (see for example Firth 1997{{ref|Firth}}). It can be regarded as one of the [[Yorkshire Dales]], though as it passes through the city, it is often not recognised as such. The beck's course through the city centre is [[culvert]]ed and has been since the mid-19th century. On the 1852 [[Ordnance Survey]] map{{ref|OS_1852}} it is visible as far as Sun Bridge, at the end of Tyrrell Street, and then from beside [[Bradford Forster Square railway station]] on Kirkgate. On the 1906 Ordnance Survey,{{ref|OS_1906}} it disappears at Tumbling Hill Street, off Thornton Road, and appears north of Cape Street, off Valley Road, though there are culverts as far as Queens Road.

The [[Bradford Canal]], built in 1774, linking the city to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] took its water from [[Bradford Beck]] and its tributaries. The supply of water from the polluted Bradford Beck was often inadequate to feed the [[Lock (water navigation)|locks]] and heavily polluted the canal over time.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Bradford Canal |url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/bradford/bf2.htm |access-date=2 September 2023 |website=www.penninewaterways.co.uk}}</ref> Due to the polluted state of the canal causing health problems, the council temporarily closed the canal in 1866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bradford Canal |url=https://waterways.org.uk/waterways/discover-the-waterways/bradford-canal |access-date=2 September 2023 |website=Inland Waterways}}</ref> In 1922, the canal was permanently closed due to it not being economically viable to maintain the canal. In modern times, remnants of the canal can still be found, including by Canal Road where the route of the old canal can be seen by car.<ref>{{cite web |title=Virtual Journey along the Bradford Canal |url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/bradford/bf34.htm |access-date=2 September 2023 |website=www.penninewaterways.co.uk}}</ref>

===Geology===
The underlying geology of the city is primarily [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]]s. These vary in quality from rough rock to fine, honey-coloured stone of building quality. Access to this material has had a pronounced effect on the architecture of the city.{{sfn|Sheeran|2005|p=9}} The city also lies within the north western parts of the [[South Yorkshire Coalfield|Yorkshire Coalfield]] which is mostly composed of carboniferous [[coal measures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nmrs.org.uk/mines/coal/yorkshire/index.html|access-date=9 April 2016|title=Yorkshire Coalfield|publisher=Northern Mine Research Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331031137/http://nmrs.org.uk/mines/coal/yorkshire/index.html|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The coal measures stimulated early urban development, in the modern day, geological extraction of minerals is heavily reduced in terms of scale.<ref>{{cite web |title=BGS publications online |url=https://pubs.bgs.ac.uk/publications.html?pubID=B06092 |access-date=2 September 2023 |website=pubs.bgs.ac.uk}}</ref>

===Climate===

===Green belt===
{{further|South and West Yorkshire Green Belt}}
Bradford is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the borough and wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt1">{{cite web|last1=Council|first1=Bradford Metropolitan District|title=Land allocations Development Plan Document|url=https://www.bradford.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/land-allocations-dpd/?Folder=Green+Belt+Review+Draft+Methodology+consultation|website=Bradford Metropolitan District Council|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143259/https://www.bradford.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/land-allocations-dpd/?Folder=Green+Belt+Review+Draft+Methodology+consultation|archive-date=22 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The green belt surrounds the Bradford built-up area, separating towns and villages throughout the borough. Larger outlying communities such as [[Bingley]], [[Wilsden]], [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]], and [[Thornton, Bradford|Thornton]] are also exempt from the green belt area. However, nearby smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as [[Brunthwaite, Bradford|Brunthwaite]], Keelham, Denholme Gate, [[Laycock, West Yorkshire|Laycock]], [[Esholt]], [[Micklethwaite, Bradford|Micklethwaite]], [[Goose Eye]], [[Stanbury]], [[Hainworth]], [[Tong, West Yorkshire|Tong]], and Harecroft are 'washed over' by the designation.<ref name="belt1"/> Much semi-rural land on the fringes is also included. The area in 2017 amounted to some {{convert|23890|ha|km2+sqmi}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green belt statistics – GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703133634/https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|archive-date=3 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests,<ref name="belt1"/> with rural landscape features, greenfield areas and facilities including Park Wood, [[Northcliffe Park|Northcliffe park and woods]], [[Heaton Woods]], Chellow Dene woods and reservoirs, Horton Bank country park, Norr Hill, Gilstead recreation park, Stone Circle remains by [[Shipley Glen]], [[Bracken Hall]], River Aire valley, Leeds and Liverpool canal, and the Leeds Country Way.

In October 2011 Plans to regenerate Bradford city centre, including the long-delayed Broadway shopping centre, was given a boost as Bradford Council secured £17.6&nbsp;million of regional growth funding from the government, which it will match to create a £35&nbsp;million "growth zone" in which companies would get business rate relief in exchange for helping people get training and jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-15518851|title=Bradford in £35m regional growth fund boost|work=BBC News|date=31 October 2011|access-date=30 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225053857/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-15518851|archive-date=25 December 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

There are some fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian buildings]]: apart from the abundance of mills, there is the [[Bradford City Hall|City Hall]] (with statues of rulers of England unusually including [[Oliver Cromwell]]), the former [[Wool Exchange, Bradford|Wool Exchange]], and a large Victorian [[Undercliffe Cemetery|cemetery at Undercliffe]]. [[Little Germany, Bradford|Little Germany]] is a splendid Victorian commercial district just east of the city centre which takes its name from 19th-century [[German Jewish]] immigrants who ran businesses from some of the many [[listed building]]s. Following decades of decay there have been successful conversions to office and residential use. [[Paper Hall]] was saved from demolition and renovated in the 1990s and in mid-2005 renovation began on the prominent Eastbrook Hall in Little Germany.

The Victoria Hotel and the [[Midland Hotel, Bradford|Midland Hotel]] were built to accommodate business travellers to the city during the height of the woollen trade.

In addition to Undercliffe Cemetery, there are seven other cemeteries in Bradford, located in Bowling, Clayton, North Bierley Thornton, Queensbury, Scholemoor, Thornton and Tong, as well as a number of Council-operated cemeteries in Keighley, Wharfedale and other parts of the district.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council |url=https://bradford.gov.uk/births-deaths-marriages-and-civil-partnerships/deaths/burials-and-cemeteries/ |title=Burials and cemeteries | accessdate= 28 April 2022}}</ref>

Like many cities, Bradford lost a number of notable buildings to [[Real estate developer|developers]] in the 1960s and 1970s: particularly mourned at the time were the [[Swan Arcade, Bradford|Swan Arcade]] and the old Kirkgate Market.

The [[Bradford Odeon]], formerly the Gaumont and New Victoria Theatre, was built in 1930 as a music venue and cinema with a capacity of over 3,000, and was the largest UK cinema outside London at the time. (Another Odeon, always part of the [[Odeon Cinemas]] chain, was built in the city in 1938 and demolished in 1969.) Standing in a conservation area adjacent to the listed Alhambra Theatre, it closed in 2000 and was sold to developer Langtree with the intention it would be demolished and replaced with an apartment and office block. The Odeon was the subject of much controversy over these proposals, with public support in the form of a 10,000-signature petition and campaigns for its renovation. In his successful by-election campaign for Bradford West in March 2012, [[George Galloway]] cited the restoration of the Odeon as his number one priority, later asking Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to intervene.<ref>{{cite news|last=Casci|first=Mark|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/cameron-urged-to-help-save-bradford-odeon-1-4459853|title=Cameron urged to help save Bradford Odeon|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=19 April 2012|access-date=17 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222084616/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/cameron-urged-to-help-save-bradford-odeon-1-4459853|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The architectural historian [[Jonathan Foyle]], actresses [[Imelda Staunton]] and [[Jenny Agutter]], and director [[Michael Winner]] all lent their support to the campaign.

==Transport==
In past centuries Bradford's location in Bradfordale made transport difficult, except from the north; this is no longer a problem.{{why|date=January 2022}}

===Road===
Bradford was first connected to the developing [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] network in 1734,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} when the first [[Yorkshire]] turnpike was built between [[Manchester]] and Leeds via [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and the city.

It is now accessed by [[trunk road]]s: the [[A647 road|A647]] between Leeds and Halifax via [[Queensbury, West Yorkshire|Queensbury]], the [[A650 road|A650]] between [[Wakefield]] and [[Keighley]], the A658 to [[Harrogate]] and the [[A6036 road|A6036]] to Halifax via [[Shelf, West Yorkshire|Shelf]].

The [[M606 motorway|M606]], a spur of the [[M62 motorway]], connects Bradford with the national motorway network. Although originally planned to go directly into the city centre it ends at the city's [[ring road]].

[[First Bradford]] and [[Arriva Yorkshire]] are the chief operators of buses in Bradford, with some routes using [[guided bus]]es.

===Water===
The [[Bradford Canal]] was a {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} spur from the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] at [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]]. It was built to connect Bradford with the [[North Riding of Yorkshire|North Riding's]] [[limestone]] [[quarry|quarries]], the industrial towns on both sides of the [[Pennines]] and the ports of Liverpool and Goole. The canal opened from 1774 until 1866 and 1871 until 1922, plans to rebuild it have existed.

===Rail===
[[File:Bradford Forster Square Station, Summer 2004 - geograph.org.uk - 84057.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bradford Forster Square railway station]]]]
[[File:Bradford stations.svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram of city centre stations in Bradford, West Yorkshire]]
The [[Leeds and Bradford Railway]] opened [[Bradford Forster Square railway station|Forster Square railway station]] on 1 July 1846 with a service via Shipley to Leeds. The station was rebuilt in the early 1850s and again, in 1890 and 1990.

The [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] opened a station at Drake Street on 9 May 1850, between [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]]. The [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] opened a third terminus at [[Bradford Adolphus Street railway station|Adolphus Street]] in 1854, but the station was too far from the centre, and the two companies built a joint station, [[Bradford Interchange|Bradford Exchange]] which opened in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/b/bradford_exchange/index.shtml|publisher=Subterranea Britannica|access-date=5 February 2008|title=Bradford Exchange|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135917/http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/b/bradford_exchange/index.shtml|archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Adolphus Street remained as a goods terminal. In 1973, Exchange station was rebuilt on a different site and in 1983 renamed [[Bradford Interchange]] and a bus station built alongside.

Forster Square and Bradford Interchange stations are part of the West Yorkshire Metro. There have been many schemes to link between Bradford's railway terminals. The major redevelopment of the city centre in the 1960s provided an opportunity to connect the termini, this did not happen with large buildings constructed in the 1990s along the proposed line of route. There is the great difference in elevation: Bradford Interchange is at the end of a long steep slope and is much higher than Forster Square. This gradient is not unprecedented in railway construction and the relocation of Forster Square further from the city centre provided additional space in which the transition could be accomplished.

A [[tram]] system was inaugurated by Bradford Corporation in 1882. At first the vehicles were [[horsecar|horse-drawn]] but were replaced by [[steam engine#steam powered vehicles|steam-driven]] trams in 1883, and by [[electric vehicle|electric]] vehicles in 1898.

[[File:University of Bradford Richmond Building.jpg|right|thumb|[[University of Bradford]]]]

The [[University of Bradford]], which has over 10,000 students, received its [[royal charter]] in 1966, but traces its history to the 1860s when it was founded as the ''Bradford Schools of Weaving, Design and Building''. The university now covers a wide range of subjects including technology and management science, optometry, pharmacy, medical sciences, nursing studies, archaeology and modern languages. Its [[Peace Studies]] department, founded with [[Quaker]] support in 1973, was for a long time the only such institution in the UK.

In terms of nationally recognised leading areas of research there are various departments such as Institute of Cancer Therapeutics, Bradford School of Pharmacy, Peace Studies, Archaeology, Engineering, Management, Centre for Skin Sciences amongst others. The university balances academic research and teaching quality with a strong tradition of social inclusion.

[[File:Bradford Cathedral - geograph-2106999.jpg|thumb|[[Bradford Cathedral]], one of the oldest churches in Bradford]]
Two carved stones, probably parts of a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] preaching cross, were found on the site of [[Bradford Cathedral]]. They indicate that Christians may have worshipped here since [[Paulinus of York]] came to the north of England in AD&nbsp;627 on a [[mission (Christian)|mission]] to convert [[Northumbria]]. He preached in [[Dewsbury]] and it was from there that Bradford was first evangelised. The vicars of Bradford later paid dues to that [[parish]]. The most prominent Christian church in Bradford is [[Bradford Cathedral]], originally the [[Parish Church]] of [[St Peter]]. The parish was in existence by 1283, and there was a stone church on the rock shelf above Bradford Beck by 1327. The [[Diocese of Bradford]] was created from part of the [[Diocese of Ripon]] in 1919, and the church became a cathedral at that time. Bradford has over 150 churches and chapels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findachurch.co.uk/Search.aspx?address=bradford+%28west+yorkshire%29|title=Showing 11 churches near Bradford (West Yorkshire)|access-date=10 September 2022|work=Find A Church}}</ref> Many of the [[Roman Catholic]] churches that are found within the city are a legacy of the large [[Irish people|Irish]] population that migrated to Bradford in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The patron saint of Bradford is [[Saint Blaise]] because of his patronage of wool combing, and his statue features on the Wool Exchange in the centre of the city. There is also a statue of the saint in St Cuthbert's Catholic Church, Wilmer Road, also noted as the location of the famous Stations of the Cross by [[Eric Gill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bradfordmuseums.org/blog/bradford-and-st-blaise/|title=Bradford and St Blaise &#124; Bradford Museums & Galleries Blog|website=www.bradfordmuseums.org|date=21 January 2019 |access-date=27 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227060705/https://www.bradfordmuseums.org/blog/bradford-and-st-blaise/|archive-date=27 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1376263|access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref>

The district has a tradition of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformity]] which is reflected in the number of chapels erected by [[Congregationalist]]s, [[Baptists]] and [[Methodist]]s. The city was a centre of the [[House Church]] movement in the 1980s, and the Christian charity [[Christians Against Poverty]] was founded in the city. Other house churches in the city include [[El Shaddai International Christian Centre]] and the World Outreach Church. Bradford is also home to the [[LIFE Church UK]], a large nonconforming church, that has around 3,000 members.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ship-of-fools.com/mystery/2006/1330.html| title=Ship of Fools: The Mystery Worshipper| publisher=ship-of-fools.com| access-date=7 October 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907065255/http://www.ship-of-fools.com/mystery/2006/1330.html| archive-date=7 September 2008| url-status=live}}</ref>

===City of Sanctuary===
After a campaign in 2008, Bradford was recognised as a 'City of Sanctuary' on 18 November 2010. Bradford is "a place where a broad range of local organisations, [[community]] groups and [[faith]] communities, as well as [[local government]], are publicly committed to welcoming and including people seeking sanctuary." The city has a history of welcoming newcomers from throughout the world. An example of this was when between December 1938 and September 1939 as part of the [[Kindertransport]] scheme, Bradford welcomed around 270 [[German Jewish]] [[refugee]] children. Many of these children were initially housed in a former hospital building on Shipley Glen, which had been converted into a temporary hostel. Later, the children were moved to private homes throughout Bradford and the surrounding areas. The purchase of the Carlton Hostel building in 1939, part of the same Kindertransport scheme, was made possible through donations from both Bradford's Jewish community and non-Jews.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clayton|first=Emma|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/tahistory/featuresnostalgiapasttimes/9703926.Bradford_s_helping_hand/|title=Bradford's helping hand|work=[[Telegraph & Argus]]|date=14 May 2012|access-date=22 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224082759/http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/tahistory/featuresnostalgiapasttimes/9703926.Bradford_s_helping_hand/|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=O'Rourke|first=Tanya|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/local/localbrad/8681412.Bradford_is_sanctuary_on_asylum_____official|title=Group wins status for city after proving community looks after refugees|work=Telegraph & Argus|date=22 November 2010|access-date=24 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111063535/http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/local/localbrad/8681412.Bradford_is_sanctuary_on_asylum_____official/|archive-date=11 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130807060219/http://www.cityofsanctuary.org/bradford "Bradford City of Sanctuary"], Cityofsanctary.org (web archive).

Singer-songwriters [[Tasmin Archer]], [[Teddy Sinclair]] and [[Kiki Dee]]—the first white British artist to be signed by [[Motown]]—also hail from the city.

Since the 1980s, Bradford has proved influential within the UK's [[punk rock]] scene, primarily because of [[the 1 in 12 Club]], a music venue and [[anarchist]] [[workers' cooperative]] and members' club. 1980s groups such as [[Sore Throat (grindcore band)|Sore Throat]], [[Anti System]] and late-era [[Doom (British band)|Doom]] all based themselves around the club,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Glasper |first1=Ian |title=Trapped in a Scene: UK Hardcore 1985–89 |date=2009 |page=302}}</ref> as did 1990s groups such as [[Voorhees (band)|Voorhees]] and Ironside.<ref name="Glasper 2012">{{cite book |last1=Glasper |first1=Ian |title=Armed with Anger: How Uk Punk Survived the Nineties |date=1 July 2012 |publisher=Cherry Red Books}}</ref>

===Curry===
In 2013 Bradford was again crowned "Curry Capital of Britain" after seeing off other strong contenders such as [[Glasgow]] and [[Wolverhampton]]. Bradford scored highly not just for the quality of food and service offered by each of the restaurants, but also for food hygiene, a deep understanding of the curry restaurant sector and its success in collectively raising funds for food charity The Curry Tree, which seeks to alleviate the plight of the poor in South East Asia. The judges were also particularly impressed by Bradford's International Food Academy and [[Jamie's Ministry of Food]], which teaches the districts residents how to cook quick, simple, healthy and cost-effective meals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/10739746.Bradford_thrilled_to_win_curry_title_third_year_in_a_row/|title=Bradford thrilled to win curry title third year in a row|first=Hannah|last=Postles|work=Bradford Telegraph and Argus|access-date=28 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029212846/http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/10739746.Bradford_thrilled_to_win_curry_title_third_year_in_a_row/|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>  The city has been voted the curry capital of the UK for 6 years running.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.roughguides.com/articles/on-the-curry-trail-in-bradford-england/ | title=Best Curry Houses in Bradford }}</ref>

Bradford Bulls play at the [[Grattan Stadium, Odsal]], formerly Odsal Stadium. The city is also home to a number of rugby union clubs—Bradford Salem are based in the Heaton area and Wibsey RFC can be found to the south of the city centre. The [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]] Sports Centre is close to the Odsal and the sports facilities at the university are also open to the public at certain times.

The defunct [[Bradford Dukes]] [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team raced at Odsal. Speedway was staged at Greenfields Stadium in the pioneer days, when it was known as the Autodrome in the early 1960s. Odsal opened its doors in 1945 and continued in the late 1950s. It entered a team in the 1960 Provincial League then fell dormant until the 1970s when it re-opened. The track staged a Speedway World Final. The speedway team rode under a number of names—probably the longest running was Bradford Northern—in common with the Rugby League team. This was changed to Bradford Barons, emulating the more successful Halifax Dukes. Eventually the Halifax team was brought to Bradford under the name Bradford Dukes.

The [[Bradford Dragons]] are the city's basketball team, competing in the second tier [[English Basketball League]] Division 1. The team play their home games at [[Bradford College]].

The city also has a history of [[skateboarding]] culture; in Ian Glasper's 2012 book ''Armed with Anger'', the city was described as "West Yorkshire's [[de facto]] skate capital".<ref name="Glasper 2012" />

Bradford is the focus of one of the UK's largest ever birth cohort studies, known as ''[[Born in Bradford]]''. Partly supported by European funding, it is the result of close collaboration between the [[University of Bradford]], the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] and other institutions in West Yorkshire. It will track the lives of all the babies born in the city from 2006 to 2008 and aims to provide a wealth of data, allowing health researchers the opportunity to investigate many different aspects of health and wellbeing.
