[[File:Elbasan Castle 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Elbasan Castle]]]]

In August 2010 archaeologists discovered two [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] graves near the walls of the castle of Elbasan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bw.balkanweb.com/kultur%C3%AB/2691/elbasan-zbulohen-dy-varre-ilire-ne-muret-e-kalase-45067.html |title=Elbasan, zbulohen dy varre ilire në muret e kalasë |last=Popja |first=Fatmir |access-date=9 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712023040/http://bw.balkanweb.com/kultur%C3%AB/2691/elbasan-zbulohen-dy-varre-ilire-ne-muret-e-kalase-45067.html |archive-date=12 July 2012 }}</ref>

In the second century BC, a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] trading post recorded in [[Latin]] as ''[[Mansio]] Scampa'' (also in {{langx|grc|Σκάμπα}}) near the site of modern Elbasan developed close to a junction of two branches of an important Roman road, the [[Via Egnatia]], which connected the [[Adriatic]] coast with [[Byzantium]]. It was one of the most important routes of the [[Roman Empire]]. By the third or fourth century AD, this place had grown into a real city protected by a substantial Roman fortress with towers; the fort covered around 300 square meters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gloyer |first=Gillian |title= Albania|url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781841623870|url-access=registration |quote=mansio scampa. |access-date= 20 October 2013|year= 2012|publisher= Bradt Travel Guides|location=Chalfont St Peter |isbn=9781841623870|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781841623870/page/107 107]}}</ref> This city appears on late antique itineraries like the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' and ''[[Itinerarium Burdigalense]]'' as ''Scampis'' or ''Hiscampis''.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Hammond |first= N.G.L. |year= 1974 |title= The Western Part of the via Egnatia |jstor=299268 |journal= The Journal of Roman Studies |publisher= Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |volume= 64|pages=188 |doi= 10.2307/299268|s2cid= 162531891 }}</ref>

It took part in the spread of [[Christianity]] along the Via, and had a bishop, cathedral and basilicas as early as the fifth century. As a town in a wide river valley it was vulnerable to attacks once the legions were withdrawn but [[Emperor Justinian]] made an effort to improve the fortifications. The city survived attacks by the [[Bulgars]] and [[Ostrogoths]] and was mentioned in the work of [[Procopius of Cæsarea]]. Ruins of a Paleochristian basilica, built in the 5th or 6th century AD, were found in Bezistan area.

The site seems to have been abandoned until the [[Ottoman army]] built a military camp there, followed by urban reconstruction under [[Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] in 1466. Mehmet constructed a massive four-sided castle with a deep moat and three gates. The name Elbasan is thought to mean 'the flat fortress' in Albanian or ‘the flat province’ in Turkish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blue-albania.com/GeneralInfo14-ELBASANI.htm|title=Blue Albania - We help you to explore Albania... - Portali me i madh turistik Shqiptar}}</ref> He had built the castle in order to fight [[Skanderbeg]], due to an [[League of Lezhë|ongoing conflict]] between the Ottomans and Albanians.<ref name="Inalcik327">{{cite book|last=Inalcik|first=Halil|chapter=The Ottoman Turks and the Crusades, 1451–1522|editor1-last=Hazard|editor1-first=Harry|editor2-last=Zacour|editor2-first=Norman|title=A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on Europe|year=1989|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299107444|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKaPrQPFIAMC&q=Elbasan+sultan&pg=PA327|pages=327}}</ref>

It became the seat of [[Sanjak of Elbasan]], a centre of Ottoman urban civilisation over the next 445 years. Although [[Halil Inalcik]] explains that the Sanjak of Elbasan was established as soon as the [[Elbasan Castle|fortress of Elbasan]] was constructed in 1466, based on [[Tursun Beg]]'s records there is a possibility that Elbasan initially was part of the [[Sanjak of Ohrid]].<ref>{{Citation |last= Kiel |first=Machiel |title= Ottoman architecture in Albania, 1385-1912 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2xYzAAAAIAAJ&q=%22the+usually+well+informed+Tursun+Beg+%22 |access-date= 9 January 2012|year= 1990|publisher=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture |location=Istanbul |isbn=978-92-9063-330-3 |page=39|quote=...states that Elbasan became a sandjak capital right after 1466 but the usually well informed Tursun Beg noted for 1466: "The sultan attached this fortress of Elbasan to the Sancak of Ohrid and returned to Edirne..." }}</ref> In 1467 many Christians from [[Skopje]], Ohrid, [[Serres]] and [[Kastoria]] were forcibly deported to Elbasan.<ref>{{Citation |last=Shukarova |first=Aneta|author2= Mitko B.

By the end of the 17th century it had 2,000 inhabitants.The fortress was dismantled by [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha|Reshit Pasha]] in 1832.In 1864, the [[Sanjak of Elbasan]] became a part of [[Monastir Vilayet]]. In the late nineteenth century, Elbasan was inhabited by 3,000 Muslim families and 280 Orthodox Christian families, of which 100 were old Orthodox Albanian families living in the old Christian neighbourhood within the fortress and 180 [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] families residing in the St. Nicholas neighbourhood on the edge of town.<ref name="Koukoudis358">{{cite book|last=Koukoudis|first=Asterios|title=The Vlachs: Metropolis and Diaspora|year=2003|location=Thessaloniki|publisher=Zitros Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01JoAAAAMAAJ&q=first+appeared|isbn=9789607760869|pages=358}} "while at the end of the nineteenth century there were 3,000 Moslem families and 280 Orthodox Christian families.

In 1909, after the [[Young Turks]] revolution in [[Istanbul]], an [[Albanian National Congress]] was held in Elbasan to study educational and cultural questions. The delegates, all from central and southern Albania, endorsed the decision of the [[Congress of Monastir]], which was held in Monastir (modern [[Bitola]], [[North Macedonia]]) to use the Latin alphabet rather than the Arabic script in written [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. Albanians, Turks, Aromunians and Sephardic Jews were living in Elbasan.

Before the Second World War, Elbasan was a city with a mixture of eastern and medieval buildings, narrow cobbled streets and a large bazaar. There was a clearly defined Muslim settlement within the castle walls, an Aromanian district on the outskirts of the city and several fine mosques and Islamic buildings. At the time the population was about 15,000 people.

The very first teachers' training college in Albania, the [[Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit]], was established in Elbasan. During [[First Balkan War]], it was occupied by [[Serbia]]n troops on 29 November 1912. They withdrew from Elbasan on 25 October 1913 due to United Kingdom and Austria Hungary's ultimatum. The Muslim majority of Elbasan opposed the installation of [[William, Prince of Albania|Prince Wied]] in 1914. Elbasan was occupied successively by [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Austrians]] and [[Italians]] between 1915 and 1918. The Bulgarian army occupied Elbasan on January 29, 1916, during [[Bulgarian occupation of Albania]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Owen|title=Albania and King Zog: independence, republic and monarchy 1908-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_Sh3y9IMZAC&q=led+by+Themistokli+Germenji&pg=PA103|quote= January 29th; ...

The city was also noted for its good public buildings, advanced educational provisions, public gardens and timber-built shops. There was much wartime damage, which was followed by an intensive programme of industrial development in the [[Communist]] period that boosted the city to around 75,000 inhabitants. The culmination of this process was the construction of the huge ''Steel of the Party'' ({{langx|sq|Celiku i Partise}}) [[metallurgical]] complex outside the city, in the [[Shkumbini]] valley, built with Chinese assistance in the 1970s. It was emphatically called "The Second National Liberation of Albanian" by [[Enver Hoxha]]. The cost of the complex in environmental impact was high for the Shkumbin valley.<ref name="polluted">{{cite web|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Albania/Elbasan-the-polluted-city-124037|title=Elbasan, Elbasan, the polluted city|last=Rukaj|first=Marjola|access-date=20 October 2013}}</ref> [[Elbasan Railway Station]] was opened in 1950. In 2014, the Albanian government reconstructed former Ruzhdi Bizhuta Stadium. The renovated [[Elbasan Arena]] became the home stadium of the [[Albania national football team]] and Albania's de facto stadium meeting FIFA's criteria.

[[File:Elbasan from South.jpg|thumb|Elbasan from South]]

Industrial development began during the [[Zog of Albania|Zog]] regime with the production of [[tobacco]] and [[alcoholic beverage]]s, and culminated during the [[communist]] regime. The city gained prominence after the [[China|Chinese]] built a [[steel mill]] in 1974. One travel writer relayed from conversation that during the communist regime, "almost everyone in the country seemed to have a gun, likely manufactured by this Chinese-financed factory in Elbasan," and the "country did not seem to have tractors, ploughs, or sewing machines."<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Theroux|title=The Pillars of Hercules: A Grand Tour of the Mediterranean|publisher=Fawcett Columbine|location=New York|date=1995|page=272|isbn=0449910857}}</ref>

The city also hosts a [[ferrochrome]] [[AlbChrome#Facilities|smelter]], which was commissioned in 1989 by the communist regime and now is owned by the [[Balfin Group]].

The city was a hub for heavy industry during the communist regime, mostly metallurgic and metal processing factories. All these industries caused big [[pollution]] and Elbasan is considered today to be one of the most polluted cities of Albania.

In recent years Elbasan, like the rest of Albania, has had to deal not only with local pollution, but also with what environmentalists call "imported pollution", because of the waste imported from abroad for the recycling process in private companies.<ref name="polluted"/>

Elbasan has been occupied by several different groups, including the [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Austrians]] and [[Italians]]. Elbasan remained a center of [[Christianity]] in Albania even after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation. After the 1908 [[Congress of Monastir]] (in modern [[Bitola]], [[North Macedonia]]) decided to use the [[Latin alphabet]] for the written [[Albanian language]], [[Islam|Muslim]] clerics influenced by the [[Ottoman Empire]] held various demonstrations in favor of the [[Arabic script]] in Elbasan.

In the center of the city, is located the [[Saint Mary (Elbasan)|Saint Mary]] Orthodox Church. The church was built in 1830 on the foundations of an older church, which had partially burned in 1819. Paintings and frescoes of [[Onufri]], restored by [[David Selenicasi]] and [[Kostadin Shelcani]] can still be seen. The church has been an important religious and cultural center for the Albanian language. [[Teodor Haxhifilipi]], [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], and [[Aleksandër Xhuvani]] have served in the church. They are the authors of translations into Albanian of many psalms. The church building served as the first Albanian school of Elbasan in modern times, which opened in 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kishaautoqefale.webs.com/historiaekishs.htm |title=From the Saint Mary website |publisher=Kishaautoqefale.webs.com |access-date=2013-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305094001/http://kishaautoqefale.webs.com/historiaekishs.htm |archive-date=2012-03-05 }}</ref>

Other orthodox churches in the [[Elbasan District]] include the Mameli church (built in the 17th century), the Saint Nicholas church ({{langx|sq|Shen Kolli}}) in  [[Shelcan]] (built in 1554), the Saint Nicholas church in [[Valesh]] (built in 1604), the [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]] church in [[Sterstan]] (built in the 18th century), the Saint Michael ({{langx|sq|Shen Mehilli}}) church in [[Shalës]] (built in the 17th century), the Saint Mary church in [[Dragot]] (built in the 18th century), the Saint Nicholas church of Elbasan (17th century), and the Elbasan [[Athanasius of Alexandriane|Saint Athanasius]] church of Elbasan (built in 1554).

About 7&nbsp;km away from Elbasan there is an old monastery and orthodox church where notably Saint [[Jovan Vladimir]] was buried until 1995 when his remains were transferred to the Orthodox Cathedral in Tirana, being brought back to the monastery only for his feast days.<ref>{{cite web|last = Milosavljević|first = Presbyter Čedomir|script-title = sr:Св.

Elbasan is home to the [[National Autocephalous Albanian Church]] ({{langx|sq|Kisha Autoqefale Kombetare}}), a relatively new Orthodox Autocephalous church that split from the [[Albanian Orthodox Church]] in 1995. Father Nikolle Marku is the leader of the new denomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kishaautoqefale.webs.com/konfliktimekishngreke.htm |title=Church's official website |publisher=Kishaautoqefale.webs.com |access-date=2013-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305093816/http://kishaautoqefale.webs.com/konfliktimekishngreke.htm |archive-date=2012-03-05 }}</ref>

Since 2004, it has become a national holiday being celebrated nationwide, in all Albania.
