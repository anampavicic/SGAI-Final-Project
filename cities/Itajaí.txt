It lies at the mouth of the Itajaí River, at 20 feet (6 metres) above sea level. The city has the 2nd largest [[gross domestic product]]<ref>{{cite web|url = http://diariocatarinense.clicrbs.com.br/sc/economia/noticia/2014/12/itajai-ultrapassa-joinville-como-o-municipio-mais-rico-do-estado-4661137.html|title = Itajaí ultrapassa Joinville como o município mais rico do Estado|date = 11 December 2014|access-date = 6 January 2015|archive-date = 6 January 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150106180508/http://diariocatarinense.clicrbs.com.br/sc/economia/noticia/2014/12/itajai-ultrapassa-joinville-como-o-municipio-mais-rico-do-estado-4661137.html|url-status = dead}}</ref> and the highest [[per capita income]] in the [[Santa Catarina (state)|State of Santa Catarina]].

==History==
The city was founded on June 15, 1860, but the colonization of Itajaí had started in 1658 when the [[Paulista (disambiguation)|Paulista]] João Dias D'Arzão arrived in the region. In 1750, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonists coming from [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]] made this region their home. By 1823 it became a prominent region for Portuguese settlers and, at the end of the 19th century, received a great number of [[Germans|German]] [[immigrants]].{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Itajaí and most of Santa Catarina State area is prone to torrential storms specially during the Spring season. Floods are frequent and even tornadoes can form.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In late November 2008, around 100 people perished in floods due to the long lasting showers that fell in Southeastern and Southern Brazil. 90% of the city was underwater and the port was partially destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeindustries.org/documents/view.jsp?id=760|website=www.maritimeindustries.org|title=Archived copy|access-date=2009-01-30|archive-date=2016-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826192458/http://www.maritimeindustries.org/documents/view.jsp?id=760|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many lost their homes and other possessions and had no ready shelters to turn to, for the rain combined with river waters invaded every section of the city and most of Central and Coastal Santa Catarina State. President Lula da Silva and other officials flew over the area to evaluate the damage and offer help. The state was declared a disaster area by the State and Federal governments.

== Demography ==
The majority of the population is descended from Germans, Italians and Azoreans. The mixture of German, Italian and Portuguese cultures is a landmark of the city.
