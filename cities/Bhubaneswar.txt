== Etymology ==
''Bhubaneswar'' is the anglicisation of the actual [[Odia language|Odia]] name "Bhubaneśwara"(ଭୁବନେଶ୍ୱର), derived from the word ''Tribhubaneśwara'' (ତ୍ରିଭୁବନେଶ୍ୱର), which literally means the Lord (Iśwara) of the Three Worlds (Tribhubana), which in this context refers to [[Shiva]].<ref name=":0" />

Bhubaneswar stands near the ruins of [[Sisupalgarh]].

From 1952 to 1979, it was administered by a [[Notified Area Council]] or a ''nagar panchayat''; a [[municipality]] was established only on 12 March 1979. During this time, due to fear of wild animals and forested areas, Cuttack continued to be the people's favourite destination, which continues to be even today. The government officials lived at Cuttack and came to Bhubaneswar for work. The government then forced the officials to live at Bhubaneswar. Then some traders came to set up some shops.  By the 1991 census, the population of Bhubaneswar had increased to 411,542. Accordingly, on 14 August 1994, the [[Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation]] was established.<ref name="Nab_Ramesh_2005" />

Growth in the east is restricted due to the presence of [[Kuakhai River]] and by the wildlife sanctuary in the northwestern part.<ref name=citystructure /> The city can be broadly divided into the old town, planned city (or state capital), added areas and  into Units and Colonies.

The old town or "Temple Town", the oldest part of the city, is characterised by many temples, including the [[Lingaraja temple|Lingaraja]], [[Nilakantha Siva Temple|Nilakantha Siva]], [[Rajarani Temple|Rajarani]] and [[Muktesvara deula|Muktesvara temples]], standing alongside residential areas. Additional structures include the [[Somabaresvara Siva Temple]] and the [[Kartikesvara Siva Temple]]. The area is congested, with narrow roads and poor infrastructure.<ref name=citystructure /> Among neighbourhoods in the old town are Rajarani Colony, Pandaba Nagar, Brahmeswara Bagh, Lingaraja Nagar, Gouri Nagar, Bhimatangi, Kapilaprasad and Sundarpada.

The planned city was designed in 1948 to house the capital. It is subdivided into units, each with a high school, shopping centres, dispensaries and play areas. While most of the units house government employees, Unit V houses the administrative buildings, including the State Secretariat, State Assembly and the Raj Bhavan. Private residential areas were later built in other areas of the planned city, including [[Saheed Nagar]] and Satya Nagar. Unit I, popularly known as the Market Building, was formed to cater to the shopping needs of the new capital's residents. Later, markets and commercial establishments developed along the [[Janpath, Bhubaneswar|Janpath]] and [[Cuttack-Puri Road]] at [[Saheed Nagar]], Satya Nagar, Bapuji Nagar and Ashok Nagar. A dedicated institutional area houses educational and research institutes, including [[Utkal University]], the [[Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar|Institute of Physics]], the [[Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology]] and Sainik School. Indira Gandhi Park, Gandhi Park and the Biju Patnaik Park are located in the unit.<ref name=citystructure />

The added areas are mostly areas lying north of National Highway 5, including Nayapalli, Jayadev Vihar, [[Chandrasekharpur]] and [[Chandrasekharpur#Sailashree Vihar|Sailashree Vihar]], [[#Niladri vihar|Niladri vihar]] which were developed by Bhubaneswar Development Authority to house the growing population.<ref name=citystructure /> With the development of the new areas such as Chandrasekharpur the city is now divided roughly into North (newer areas) and South Bhubaneswar (older areas) by the NH-5 highway.

The peripheral areas are outside the municipal boundary or have subsequently been included within the extended boundary, including Tomando, Patia and Raghunathpur. Most of these areas were developed in a haphazard manner, without proper planning.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Praharaj|first=Maharani|title=Urban sprawl: Its impact on peri-urban areas of Bhubaneswar|url=http://dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/98402-urban-sprawl-its-impact-on-peri-urban-areas-of-bhubaneswar.html|access-date=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Pioneer|date=30 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703212324/http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/98402-urban-sprawl-its-impact-on-peri-urban-areas-of-bhubaneswar.html|archive-date=3 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Master Planning Branch of the [[Bhubaneswar Development Authority]] developed the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) in 2010.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=:: Bhubaneswar Development Authority|url=https://www.bda.gov.in/bda/departments/planning-department|access-date=2020-11-06|website=www.bda.gov.in}}</ref> According to the Odisha Development Authorities Act, 1982, the Development Authority has control over the planning for municipal areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Odisha Development Authorities Act, 1982|url=http://lawodisha.gov.in/files/acts/act_604522165_1443019617.pdf|access-date=6 November 2020|website=Law Department, Government of Odisha}}{{Dead link|date=March 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Apart from the CDP, BDA has also created Zonal Development Plans for some of the areas under the CDP.<ref name=":3" /> Bhubaneswar secured the top rank in the [[Smart city]] list in India.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bhubaneswar ranked country's smartest city|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Bhubaneswar-ranked-countrys-smartest-city/articleshow/50766312.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206163635/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Bhubaneswar-ranked-countrys-smartest-city/articleshow/50766312.cms|archive-date=6 February 2016|access-date=11 March 2016|work=The Times of India|date=29 January 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Wray|first=Sarah|title=Smart City Bhubaneswar: A Citizen-Centered Approach for Smart Growth|url=https://hub.beesmart.city/city-portraits/smart-city-portrait-bhubaneswar-india|access-date=2021-01-03|website=hub.beesmart.city|language=en}}</ref>
