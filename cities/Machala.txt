'''Machala''' ({{IPA|es|maˈtʃala}}) is a city in south-west [[Ecuador]]. It is the capital of the [[El Oro Province]], and is located near the [[Gulf of Guayaquil]] on [[fertility (soil)|fertile]] [[lowland]]s. Machala has a [[population]] of 288,072 (2022 census); it is the sixth-biggest city in the country, and the second-most important port. It has been referred to as the '''''Banana Capital of the World''.'''

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
Machala is a commercial center for the surrounding [[agriculture]] industries. There is a large trade in [[banana]]s, [[coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]. The banana industry is especially oriented for exportation, and plays a huge role in the city's economy. Bananas are shipped out from nearby [[Puerto Bolívar]] mainly to North America. Machala's geographical position near [[Guayaquil]] also makes it an important transportation center. Many travelers heading south to Peru or north to Guayaquil funnel through the city. It is not known as a tourist destination among Ecuadorians or international tourists, though its proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]] positions it close to beaches. Machala has a growing economy that was marked in 2007 by the inauguration of its first mall, with a movie theater, on the outskirts of the city.

==Orientation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
The center of Machala is dominated by a large Catholic church and a central plaza. The plaza was built in the early 2000s to include a large fountain. There are many hotels situated in the center of the city. Las Brisas, located nearly a mile from the central plaza, is another popular place in Machala; it is a wealthier neighborhood which used to serve as a popular hangout for local teenagers. But the remodeling of La Zona Rosa, as well as the decreased safety of the area, have led to its becoming less popular.

==Education==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
Machala has one university, the Universidad Técnica de Machala. There are many private schools in Machala and one public high school – Colegio 9 de Octubre. The city serves as a stopping-off point on the way to nearby [[Puerto Bolívar]] and the [[Jambelí Islands]], which can only be reached by ferry.

==Climate==
Machala features a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh''). Like most of the coastal region of Ecuador, there is a short [[wet season]] from January to April due to the retreat of the [[Humboldt Current]]. The weather in both wet and [[dry season]]s is very warm to hot and cloudy due to persistent fog from the cold current.
