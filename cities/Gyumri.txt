'''Gyumri''' ({{langx|hy|Գյումրի}},{{efn|[[Classical Armenian orthography|Classical spelling]]: Գիւմրի}} {{IPA-hy|ɡjumˈɾi|pron}}) is an urban municipal community and the [[List of cities and towns in Armenia|second-largest city]] in [[Armenia]], serving as the administrative center of [[Shirak Province]] in the northwestern part of the country. By the end of the 19th century, when the city was known as '''Alexandropol''',{{efn|{{langx|ru|Александрополь}}; {{langx|hy|Ալեքսանդրապոլ}}}} it became the largest city of Russian-ruled [[Eastern Armenia]] with a population above that of [[Yerevan]]. The city became renowned as a cultural hub, while also carrying significance as a major center of Russian troops during Russo-Turkish wars of the 19th century.

The city underwent a tumultuous period during and after [[World War I]]. While Russian forces withdrew from the South Caucasus due to the [[October Revolution]], the city became host to large numbers of Armenian refugees fleeing the [[Armenian genocide|Armenian Genocide]], in particular hosting 22,000 orphaned children in around 170 orphanage buildings. It was renamed '''Leninakan'''{{efn|{{langx|hy|Լենինական}}, {{IPA-hy|lɛninɑˈkɑn|pron}}; {{langx|ru|Ленинакан}}, {{IPA|ru|lʲɪnʲɪnəˈkan|pron}}}} during the Soviet period and became a major industrial and textile center in [[Soviet Armenia]].<ref name="History">{{Cite web |title=History |url=https://visitgyumri.com/gyumri-history/ |access-date=2022-07-18 |website=Visit Gyumri |language=en-US |archive-date=2019-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107181137/https://visitgyumri.com/gyumri-history/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city's population rapidly grew to above 200,000 prior to the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|1988 Spitak earthquake]], when it was devastated, with the city's population being reduced to 121,976 as of the 2011 census. The city was renamed Gyumri under modern independent Armenia soon after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and post-earthquake reconstruction efforts continue.

Today, Gyumri continues to grapple with the lasting effects of the 1988 earthquake, but remains known as the cultural hub of Armenia due to the many artists and craftsman who originated from the city. The city is also in particular notable for the large [[Kumayri historic district]] that managed to mostly survive the 1988 earthquake, dating back mainly to the 19th century and being one of the few surviving places in the world with authentic urban [[Armenian architecture]].<ref name="History"/>

==Name==

The area of modern-day Gyumri was originally known as '''Kumayri''' ({{langx|hy|Կումայրի}}) during the period of the Kingdom of [[Urartu]]. Over time, the name became disrupted through phonetic changes to Kumri, then Gumri, and finally '''Gyumri'''. In 1837, Gyumri was renamed '''Alexandropol''' after Czar Nicholas I's wife, Princess [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Fyodorovna]]. Between 1924 and 1990, the city was known as '''Leninakan''' in honor of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Following independence, the original name '''Kumayri''' was used until 1992, when '''Gyumri''' was chosen as the name of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our history |url=https://www.gyumricity.am/en/gyumri/our-history |access-date=2022-07-18 |website=gyumricity.am}}</ref><ref name="History"/>

Archaeological excavations conducted throughout the Soviet period have shown that the area of modern-day Gyumri has been populated since at least the third millennium BC. The area was mentioned as '''Kumayri''' in the historic [[Urartu|Urartian]] inscriptions dating back to the 8th century BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyumri.am/eng/history.html|publisher=Cimmerian|access-date=14 June 2015|title=Kumayri infosite|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106210024/http://www.gyumri.am/eng/history.html|archive-date=6 November 2012}}</ref> Kumayri may be identical with the city of Gymnias or Gumnias mentioned by [[Xenophon]] in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|''Anabasis'']].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Garsoïan |first=Nina G. |date=1984 |title=The Early-Mediaeval Armenian City: An Alien Element? |url=https://janes.scholasticahq.com/article/2330-the-early-medieval-armenian-city-an-alien-element |journal=[[Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society|JANES]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=68}}</ref>

At the decline of the [[Urartu]] Kingdom by the second half of the 6th century BC, Kumayri became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The remains of a royal settlement found just to the south of Gyumri near the village of [[Beniamin]] dating back to the 5th to 2nd centuries BC, are a great example of the Achemenid influence in the region. However, at the beginning of the 5th century BC, Kumayri became part of the [[Satrapy of Armenia]] under the rule of the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]]. An alternative theory suggests that Kumayri has been formed as an urban settlement in the late 5th century BC, ca. 401&nbsp;BC, by [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046406?tocId=9046406|title=Gyumri Armenia Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref>

Later in 331 BC, the entire territory was included in the [[Ayrarat]] province of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Ancient Armenian Kingdom]] as part of the Shirak canton. Between 190 BC and 1 AD Kumayri was under the rule of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]] of Armenia. During the 1st century AD, Shirak was granted to the [[Kamsarakan]] family, who ruled over Kumayri during the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shirakmuseum.am/main.php?menu_id=1&sub_menu_id=0&lang=1 |title=Shiral Regional Museum |access-date=2016-10-16 |archive-date=2016-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112440/http://www.shirakmuseum.am/main.php?menu_id=1&sub_menu_id=0&lang=1 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Medieval period===
Following the partition of Armenia in 387 between the Byzantines and the Persians, and as a result of the fall of the Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia in 428, Shirak including Kumayri became part of the [[Sasanian Empire]] of Persia. In 658 AD, at the height of the Arab Islamic invasions, Kumayri was conquered during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] to become part of the [[Arminiya|Emirate of Armenia]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].<ref>[Book: The Arab Campaign of Armenia, Author: Ghevond the Historian (8th century), published in 1857, Paris (Ղևոնդ պատմագիր, Արշաւանք արաբաց ի Հայս, Փարիզ, 1857)]</ref>

Kumayri was a significant and quite-developed urban settlement during the [[Middle Ages]]. According to the Armenian scholar ''Ghevond the Historian'', the town was a center of the Armenian rebellion led by ''Artavazd Mamikonian'' against the Islamic Arab [[Caliphate]], between 733 and 755. After 2 centuries of Islamic rule over Armenia, the [[Bagratid dynasty of Armenia|Bagratids]] declared independence in 885 establishing the [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]].<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', p. 75.</ref><ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 45.</ref> Kumayri entered e new era of growth and progress, particularly when the nearby city of Ani became the capital of the kingdom in 961. By the second half of the 10th century, Kumayri was under the influence of the Armenian [[Pahlavuni]] family, who were descendants of the Kamsarakans. The Pahlavunis had a great contribution in the progress of Shirak with the foundation of many fortresses, monastic complexes, educational institutions, etc.<ref>{{in lang|hy}} Arakelyan, Babken N.

After the fall of Armenia to the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045 and later to the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] invaders in 1064. Under the foreign rulers, the town had gradually lost its significance during the following centuries, until the establishment of the [[Zakarid Armenia|Zakarid Principality of Armenia]] in 1201 under the [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] protectorate. During the Zakarid rule, the Eastern Armenian territories, mainly Lori and Shirak, entered into a new period of growth and stability, becoming a trade center between the east and the west. After the Mongols captured [[Ani]] in 1236, Armenia turned into a [[Mongol Armenia|Mongol protectorate]] as part of the [[Ilkhanate]], and the Zakarids became vassals to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. After the fall of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century, the Zakarid princes ruled over Lori, Shirak, and Ararat plain until 1360 when they fell to the invading Turkic tribes.<ref name="The Turco-Mongol Invasions">{{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/atmi4.htm |title=The Turco-Mongol Invasions |publisher=Rbedrosian.com |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref>

By the last quarter of the 14th century, the [[Ag Qoyunlu]] Sunni [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkic]] tribe took over Armenia, including Shirak. In 1400, [[Timur]] invaded Armenia and Georgia, and captured more than 60,000 of the survived local people as slaves. Many districts including Shirak were depopulated.<ref name="The Turco-Mongol Invasions"/> In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe. According to the Armenian historian [[Thomas of Metsoph]], although the Kara Koyunlu levied heavy taxes against the Armenians, the early years of their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place.<ref>Kouymjian, Dickran (1997), "Armenia from the Fall of the Cilician Kingdom (1375) to the Forced Migration under Shah Abbas (1604)" in ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century'', ed.

During the first half of the 18th century, Kumayri became part of the [[Erivan Khanate]] under the rule of the [[Afsharid dynasty]] and later under the [[Qajar dynasty]] of Persia.

In June 1804, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] forces controlled over Shirak region at the beginning of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804 and 1813]]. Kumayri became officially part of the Russian Empire at the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] signed on 1 January 1813 between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia.

During the period of Russian rule, Gyumri became one of the developing cities in the [[Transcaucasus]]. In 1829, in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War]], there was a big influx of Armenian population, as around 3,000 families who had migrated from territories in the Ottoman Empire -in particular from the towns of [[Kars]], [[Erzurum]], and [[Doğubayazıt|Doğubeyazıt]]- settled in and around Gyumri. The Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] visited Gyumri during his journey to [[Erzurum]] in 1829.
[[File:Surb Nshan1.jpg|thumb|Surb Nshan Church of 1870]]
In 1837 Russian [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] arrived in Gyumri and changed the name into '''Alexandropol'''. The name was chosen in honour of Tsar Nicholas I's wife, Princess [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte of Prussia]], who had changed her name to ''Alexandra Fyodorovna'' after converting to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]].

A major [[Russia]]n fortress was built on the site in 1837. Alexandropol was finally formed as a town in 1840 to become the center of the newly established [[Aleksandropol Uyezd|Alexandropol Uyezd]], experiencing rapid growth during its first decade. In 1849, the Alexandropol Uyezd became part of the [[Erivan Governorate]]. The town was an important outpost for the Imperial Russian armed forces in the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasus]] where their military barracks were established (e.g., at Poligons, Severski, Kazachi Post). The Russians built the [[Sev Berd]] fortress at the western edge of the city during the 1830s in response to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]].

Alexandropol had been quickly transformed to become one of the major centers of the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]]. After the establishment of the railway station in 1899, Alexandropol witnessed significant growth and became the largest city in Eastern Armenia. By the end of the 19th century, Alexandropol was home to 430 shopping stores, several workshops, cultural institutions, a girl's gymnasium, a commercial school, a theater, and leather, bear, and soap enterprises.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 November 2021 |title=Ալեքսանդրապոլի գավառ. տարածքը և բնակչությունը 1831-1918 թվականներին |trans-title=The Alexandropol uezd: area and population in 1831–1918 |url=https://www.aniarc.am/2021/11/27/alexandrapol-uezd-1840/ |access-date=10 July 2022 |website=ANI Armenian Research Center}}</ref>

[[File:Alexandropol 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandropol in 1901]]
In 1902, the first bank in the city was opened. Until the sovietization of Armenia in 1920, Alexandropol had 31 manufacturing centers including beer, soap, textile, etc. After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 and the Russian withdrawal from the [[South Caucasus]], the Ottoman forces launched a new offensive capturing the city of Alexandropol on 11 May 1918, during the [[Caucasus Campaign]] in [[World War I]]. However, the Ottomans withdrew from the city on 24 December 1918, as stipulated by the [[Armistice of Mudros]].{{cn|date=December 2022}} On 6 December 1918, the Armenian army reoccupied the city.{{sfn|Der Matossian|2020|p=15}}

The newly established [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] proclaimed on 28 May 1918, included the city of Alexandropol. On 10 May 1920, the local Bolshevik Armenians aided by the Muslim population, attempted a [[coup d'état]] in Alexandropol against the Dashnak government of Armenia. The [[May Uprising|uprising]] was suppressed by the Armenian government on May 14 and its leaders were executed. However, during [[Turkish-Armenian War|another Turkish invasion]], Turkish troops attacked Alexandropol and occupied the city on 7 November 1920. Armenia was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on December 3 to stop the Turkish advance towards Yerevan, however a concurrent Soviet invasion led to the fall of the Armenian government on December 2. The Turkish forces withdrew from Alexandropol after the [[Treaty of Kars]] was signed in October 1921 by the unrecognized Soviet and Turkish governments.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1967|p=198}}
[[File:Gyumri 8 July 2017 (2).jpg|thumb|Rizhkov Street in central Gyumri]]
Under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, the name of the city was changed in 1924 to Leninakan after the deceased Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The city suffered an [[1926 Kars earthquake|earthquake in 1926]], when many of its significant buildings were destroyed including the Greek church of Saint George.

Leninakan became a major industrial center in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and its second-largest city, after the capital Yerevan. The city suffered major damage during the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], which devastated many parts of the country. The earthquake occurred along a known thrust fault with a length of {{convert|60|km|sp=us}}. Its [[Strike and dip|strike]] was parallel to the Caucasus range and dipped to the north-northeast. [[Bruce Bolt]], a seismologist and a professor of earth and planetary science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], walked the fault scarp in 1992 and found that the vertical displacement measured {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} along most of the length with the southwest end reaching {{convert|1.6|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bolt>{{citation|title=Earthquakes: 2006 Centennial Update&nbsp;– The 1906 Big One|last=Bolt|first=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Bolt|date=August 2005|isbn=978-0716775485|edition=Fifth|publisher=[[W.

==Demographics==
===Population===
The population of Gyumri has gradually grown since 1840 after gaining the status of town. A huge decline of the population was due to the disastrous earthquake of 1988. The dialect of Gyumri is a variant of [[Karin dialect]], closely related to [[Western Armenian]], as many [[Armenian genocide]] survivors migrated to Alexandropol.<ref name="Hovannisian">{{cite book|editor=Hovannisian, Richard|editor-link=Richard Hovannisian|title=Armenian Karin/Erzerum|year=2003|publisher=Mazda Publ.|location=Costa Mesa, California|isbn=9781568591513|page=48|quote=Thus, even today the Erzerum dialect is widely spoken in the northernmost districts of the Armenian republic as well as in the Akhalkalak (Javakheti; Javakhk) and Akhaltskha (Akhaltsikh) districts of southern Georgia}}</ref>

The city of Gyumri has a great contribution in [[Armenian folk music]]. Throughout the 19th century, Alexandrapol was considered the center of folk and traditional Armenian music. The musical culture of Alexandrapol has greatly influenced the art of [[Jivani]], who is considered the founder of modern Armenian folk music during the 19th century. Another 19th-century [[ashik]] [[Sheram]] who was born in Alexandropol, is one of the earliest [[gusans]] of traditional Armenian music in the modern history of Armenia. He is one of the most celebrated Armenian composers of folk music.

==Transportation==
===Air transportation===
[[File:Shirak Airport (exterior).jpg|thumb|[[Shirak Airport]]]]
Gyumri is served by the international [[Shirak Airport]], about {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} to the southeast of the city center. It was inaugurated in 1961 and is the second largest airport in Armenia. At the beginning of 2006, the government of Armenia felt the importance of having a second international airport, when adverse weather conditions meant that many flights had to be diverted from Yerevan's [[Zvartnots International Airport]] into Gyumri's Shirak Airport. New air traffic control equipment allowed airport workers to identify planes in a {{convert|400|km|adj=on|abbr=off}} radius.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armats.com/eng/activity/services/ta.htm|title=armats|publisher=Armats.com|access-date=15 December 2014|archive-date=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923173718/http://www.armats.com/eng/activity/services/ta.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following moderate use in 2005 and 2006 during which annual passenger traffic was at about 46,000 and several hundred aircraft movements took place each year, the airport's activity quickly declined again to the point where in 2016 passenger traffic amounted to only 12,421 and a mere 54 aircraft movements took place. However, in the beginning of 2017, as part of new efforts to develop Gyumri and its tourism industry, the government focused on revitalizing the airport. Multiple new airlines began operating flights to the airport, including [[Taron Avia]], a new Armenian airline based in Gyumri. In order attract more customers, the Ministry of Nature Protection made meteorological services free for all airlines flying to Gyumri, lowering ticket costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/tourism/shirak_airport_in_gyumri_to_get_preference/|title=arka|date=23 January 2017 |publisher=Arka.am|access-date=27 July 2017}}</ref> The [[Gyumri Technology Center]] also participated in helping revitalize the airport by adding interior design details to improve the airport's look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/en/news/2017/03/30/Shirak-airport/1752635|title=panorama|publisher=panorama.am|access-date=27 July 2017}}</ref>
