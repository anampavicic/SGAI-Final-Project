With a population of 1.5 million, thus being the third most populated region in Chile, it is divided into three provinces: [[Arauco Province|Arauco]], [[Biobío Province|Biobío]] and [[Concepción Province, Chile|Concepción]]. The latter contains its capital and largest city, [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], a major city and [[Greater Concepción|metro area]] in the country. [[Los Ángeles, Chile|Los Ángeles]], capital of the [[Biobío Province]], is another important city in the region.

==Geography==
{{See also|Maulino forest}}
The Region of the Biobío is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the east by [[Argentina]], on the north by the Chilean [[Ñuble Region|Region of Ñuble]], and on the south by the Chilean [[La Araucanía Region|Region of Araucanía]].

The Region has been hit by many [[List of earthquakes in Chile|Chilean earthquakes]], including the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|most powerful earthquake]] ever recorded (in 1960) and the [[2010 Chile earthquake|great earthquake of 2010]]. Many communities in the region were greatly affected by the earthquake of 2010 and the subsequent [[tsunami]]. That earthquake damaged [[Talcahuano]] and [[Dichato]]; the tsunami destroyed much of what remained of the port town.<ref>{{Cite web|agency=[[Associated Press]] |url= http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2010/03/02/after_quake_giant_wave_swallowed_port_town/ |title= After quake, giant wave swallowed port town |date=2 March 2010 |access-date= 3 March 2010}}</ref>

==History==

===Historic regions===
This is an inland valley between the cities of Concepción and Los Angeles, and it felt the greatest impact of the [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake of 27 February 2010]]. The Department of Rere was a vital settlement area of Chileans and the three-hundred-year struggle (until the 1870s) to defeat the strong indigenous tribe of the [[Mapuche]]s.

Chilean settlers of [[Spanish California]] from the present Region of the Bio Bío (especially from Concepción, Talcahuano, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and the Department of Rere) may have played a part in the establishment of [[Los Angeles]] and the rest of [[southern California]] in the period between 1775 and 1820.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Thousands of [[Chilean-American|Chilean]] miners, ranchers, and shopkeepers from the Biobío Region are thought to have settled the coasts, mountains, and valleys of what became American California, both before and after the [[Mexican–American War]], and to have helped create the cities of [[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], and [[San Diego, California]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Ethnography===

Along with Araucania, Ñuble, Maule and O'Higgins regions, Biobío's population is believed to be a remarkably homogeneous culture, but is of various ethnic and racial backgrounds. About 70% of inhabitants are of European origin, primarily of Spanish, German, [[French people|French]] and other European communities. The mestizos make up 27% of the population and are the result of mixing between Europeans and Amerindians, while Amerindian population is 3%, mainly Mapuche. There is a romantic symbol of Chilenidad: huaso or cowboy/ shepherd "culture", typical of Chile.

Large numbers of [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]], [[Asturian people|Asturians]], [[Basque people|Basque]], [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Leonese people|Leonese]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]n, [[Navarra]]ns, and [[Valencian people|Valencians]] nationalities other than the "[[Castilian people|Castilian]]" Spanish established the nation and culture and gave the [[Chilean Spanish|Spanish]] language to Chile.

Other waves of non-Spanish settlement of the region include [[ethnic Germans|Germans]] from Germany, Austria and Switzerland; French and [[Italians]], whom contributed to the regional wine industry; British people, like [[English Chilean|English]] and [[Scottish Chilean|Scottish]], have densely settled Concepción on the coast; [[Dutch Chilean|Dutch]], [[Greek Chilean|Greek]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] founded the oceanic fishing industry; [[Arab people]]s like the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Palestinian Chilean|Palestinians]] established several small businesses; and small scattering of [[North Americans in Chile|U.S. Americans]], [[Scandinavia]]ns and [[Eastern European]]s (mostly from the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]], especially [[Croatian Chilean|Croats]]) established themselves in Chile as they fled political turmoil.

===Religion===
According to a 2002 census 58.63% of the inhabitants of the Biobío Region profess [[Catholicism]], equivalent to 805,517 people, the third largest concentration of [[Catholics]] in a region in Chile, while the lowest percentage of Catholics corresponding to a region nationwide. 28.36% declare themselves as [[Protestant]] or [[Evangelical]], equivalent to 389,632 people, the second largest concentration of Protestants in a region, while the highest percentage of Evangelicals corresponding to a region nationwide.

The province of [[Arauco Province|Arauco]] is the only province to national level in which the number of Evangelicals, corresponding to 47.47% of the population, is greater than that of Catholics, corresponding to 36.33% of the population. It is a result of Protestant ([[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]] and Mormon missionary work in Arauco during the 20th century.

Biobío tends to show a more culturally conservative attitude in contrast to the urban areas of Santiago/Valparaiso, which have a more liberal cosmopolitan position. It is more common for residents to attend church regularly, be it Catholic or Protestant.

==Economy==
For decades, the characteristic feature of the Biobío Region has been its [[manufacturing industry]], which contributes 35.6% of its GDP and operates mainly around the ports of Talcahuano, San Vicente, Lirquén, and Coronel, the greatest concentration of ports in Chile. The range of activities is broad, extending from iron and [[steel]] making to [[foodstuff]]s manufacture, [[petrochemicals]], metalworking, [[oil refining]], and [[shipyards]].

The region's dynamism is also rooted in its large rivers. The important hydroelectric power complex on the [[Laja River (Chile)|Laja River]] is composed of the El Toro, Abanico, and Antuco power plants, and the Pangue and Ralco plants on the upper [[Biobío River]]. These facilities supply 26.6% of the energy used from [[Taltal]] in the north to [[Chiloé Archipelago]] {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south.

The region contains almost 44% of Chile's forest plantations, of which around 82% are [[Pinus radiata|radiata pine]]. It is the largest exporter of forestry products and supplies raw materials for pulp and paper plants, sawmills, and related activities.

The fishing industry is another dynamic sector. The region possesses 32% of the country's total fishing fleet, while approximately 50% of the national catch is unloaded at its ports. Moreover, this region alone is responsible for 4% of the world's catch of seafood. Main items include [[shellfish]] and [[conger eel]], [[sardines]], [[anchovy]], [[mackerel]], [[hake]], [[mollusks]], [[crustaceans]], and [[algae]].

High-quality fertile soils support a wide variety of crops, principally produce, grains, vegetables, artificial and improved pastures.

Animal husbandry focuses on production of beef, milk, and dairy products. Mining activity includes non-metallic minerals, principally quartz for the glass and steel industries.
