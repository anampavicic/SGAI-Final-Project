== History ==
Masaka was founded as a township in 1953. It became a [[town council]] in 1958 and a municipality in 1968.<ref name="CstR"/>

Masaka was a strategically important location during the [[Uganda–Tanzania War]] (1978–79), and was accordingly [[garrison]]ed by [[Uganda Army (1971–1980)|Uganda Army]] troops. These soldiers terrorized the local civilians, prompting most to flee the town. On 23–24 February 1979, the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] and allied Ugandan rebels attacked the settlement, resulting in the [[Battle of Masaka]]. The town was bombarded with artillery, and fell to the Tanzanian-led forces after light resistance. The Tanzanians subsequently levelled much of the town to take revenge for atrocities committed by the Uganda Army during its previous [[Invasion of Kagera|invasion of northwestern Tanzania]].{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=30–31}}

In course of the [[Ugandan Bush War]], Masaka again suffered from fighting. The town was garrisoned by the [[Uganda National Liberation Army]] which served as Uganda's national army at the time. In late 1985, [[National Resistance Army]] rebels [[Siege of Masaka|laid siege to the town]]. After heavy combat, Masaka's garrison surrendered on 10 December 1985.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=49–50}}

In 2019 the [[Cabinet of Uganda]], resolved to award Masaka, city status effective July 2023.<ref name="2R"/><ref name="9R">{{cite web|url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kabaka-faults-government-delayed--Masaka-city-status/688334-5151284-ffev8dz/index.html |title=Kabaka Faults Government On Delayed Masaka City Status |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |date=10 June 2019 |access-date=11 June 2019 |last=Isa Aliga |first=and Al-Mahdi Ssenkabirwa |location=Kampala}}</ref> In November of the same year, Cabinet revised the date of city status to 1 July 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.softpower.ug/cabinet-includes-masaka-mbale-among-new-cities-to-be-operational-in-2020/ |title=Cabinet Includes Masaka, Mbale Among New Cities To Be Operational In 2020 |publisher=SoftPower Uganda |date=5 November 2019 |access-date=6 November 2019 |author=Kungu Al-Mahadi Adam | place=Kampala}}</ref>
