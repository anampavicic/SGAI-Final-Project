Bogra is named after [[Nasiruddin Bughra Khan]], the Governor of [[Bengal]] from 1279 to 1282 and the son of [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bogra.gov.bd/node/1076080/%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BF|website=bogra.gov.bd|script-title=bn:জেলার পটভূমি|trans-title=District Background|access-date=5 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205023757/http://www.bogra.gov.bd/node/1076080/%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BF|archive-date=5 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city is approximately {{convert|71.56|sqkm|sqmi|2|abbr=on}} and is divided into 21 wards. Bogra has a population of around 12,40,000 people. Since it is one of the oldest cities in Bengal, Bogra is famous for its many ancient Buddhist [[stupa]]s, Hindu temples, and ancient palaces of Buddhist kings and Muslim sultans.

The city has produced notable personalities including Prime Minister [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]] of [[Pakistan]], President [[Ziaur Rahman]] of Bangladesh, both of whom were born and lived in the city.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
Bogra is considered the oldest city of Bengal, dating to the reign of the [[Emperor Ashoka|Great Emperor Ashoka]], who ruled India from 268 to 232 BCE. When Ashoka conquered the Bengal (Bongo) region, he founded Bogra and called it [[Pundravardhana|Pundra Bardhan]]. This is supported by the discovery in October 2008 of an ancient engraved stone believed to be produced in the [[Gupta]] era near [[Sura Mosque]] at [[Ghoraghat Upazila]] in [[Dinajpur District (Bangladesh)|Dinajpur]].

Bogra has been a transportation, cultural and economic hub for thousands of years. In the early 800AD, it was a core place of doing business through the Karatoya River (a sub-river of the [[Bangali River]], not to be confused with the Large [[Karatoya River]]). By 1200 AD it had also become an important geopolitical center for spreading Islam through the [[Mahasthangarh]]. In the late fiftieth century, it became a statistical trade area by the [[British East India Company]].

In the late seventeenth century, the British East India Company gave control of the area to [[Nowab]] and [[Shatani]] families, who still are two of the most reputed families in the city.

During the [[Bangladesh War of Independence]], the area witnessed the [[Battle of Bogra]], a fierce conflict between the guerrilla units of the [[Bangladesh Forces]] under Sector 7 and the [[Pakistan Army]].

==Climate==
The city enjoys a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) bordering on a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw), with two main seasons: winter and summer. Winters are dry with warm afternoons and cool nights (although frosts have never occurred in recent history), while summers are hot and humid with heavy rainfall due to the monsoon season.

===Transportation===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
Bogra is also known as the gateway of North Bengal due to its communication capabilities. Bogra has several railway stations and bus terminals (Charmatha Bus Terminal, Thantahnia Bus Terminal, BRTC Bus Terminal, and Haddipotti Bus Terminal). It has one of the best inter-district communication. Usually, people come from 20 to 45&nbsp; km to the city to do their day job. Only a handful of cities in Bangladesh have this type of communication infrastructure. People use both Train & Bus communication to visit the city every day. Bus & CNG is the most crucial communication method for most citizens.{{fact|date=October 2024}}

Almost every school has bus services (except [[Bogra Zilla School]] & [[Bogra Victoria Manorial School]]), which helps the city to have fewer traffic jams than most other cities in rush hours. It has also the 2nd highest number of Rickshaws in the country. It also has the highest number of private cars in North Bengal (Approximately 65% of the whole North-Bengal region).{{fact|date=October 2024}}

Bogra has always been the key transportation hub for Bangladesh & North Bengal. Before the '80s & 90's all Trucks & Buses in North Bengal needed to pass through Bogra to go to their desired destination. Thus Bogra has one of the biggest Motor-labor unions in the country.{{fact|date=October 2024}}
