'''Rafah''' ({{langx|ar|ÿ±ŸÅÿ≠}} {{transliteration|ar|Rafa·∏•}} {{IPA|ar|rafaƒß|}}) is a city in the southern [[Gaza Strip]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. It is the capital of the [[Rafah Governorate]] of the [[State of Palestine]], located {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} south-west of [[Gaza City]]. In 2017, Rafah had a population of 171,889.<ref name="PrelimCensus2017" /> As a result of massive bombardment and ground assaults in [[Gaza City]] and [[Khan Yunis]] by [[Israel]] during the [[Israel‚ÄìHamas war]], about 1.4 million Palestinians are believed to be sheltering in Rafah as of February 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gaza: Israel's military operation in Rafah would be fatal for displaced civilians and humanitarian aid |url=https://www.nrc.no/news/2024/february/gaza-israels-military-operation-in-rafah-would-be-fatal-for-displaced-civilians-and-humanitarian-aid/ |date=8 February 2024|access-date=8 February 2024 |work=Norwegian Refugee Council}}</ref>

After the [[1948 Palestine war]], [[Egypt]] governed the area and [[refugee camp]]s for displaced Palestinians who [[1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight|fled or were expelled]] from what became Israel were established. During the [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Israel Defence Forces]] (IDF) killed 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees in the Rafah refugee camp, during the [[1956 Rafah massacre]]. During the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israeli forces occupied the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Gaza Strip]] after capturing them from Egypt. In the same year, IDF troops bulldozed and demolished 144 houses in the Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.<ref name="HC"/>

Rafah is the site of the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], the sole crossing point between Egypt and the [[Gaza Strip]].

== Development ==

The Ottoman‚ÄìBritish agreement of 1 October 1906 established a [[Borders of Israel#Border with Egypt|boundary between Ottoman-ruled Palestine and British-ruled Egypt]], from [[Taba, Egypt|Taba]] to Rafah. After [[World War I]], Palestine was also under British control, but the Egypt-Palestine Boundary was maintained to control movement of the local [[Bedouin]]. During the mid-1930s, the British enhanced the border control and Rafah evolved as a small boundary town that functioned as a trade and services centre for the semi-settled Beduin population.<ref name="kliot_1995">{{Cite book |last=Kliot |first=Nurit |url=https://www.durham.ac.uk/media/durham-university/research-/research-centres/ibru-centre-for-borders-research/maps-and-databases/publications-database/boundary-amp-territory-briefings/btb_1-8.pdf |title=The Evolution of the Egypt-Israel Boundary: From Colonial Foundations to Peaceful Borders |publisher=[[International Boundaries Research Unit]], Department of Geography, [[University of Durham]] |year=1995 |isbn=1-897643-17-9 |editor-last=Schofield |editor-first=Clive |series=Boundary and Territory Briefing |volume=1 |pages=3, 9, 18 |access-date=27 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210805141333/https://www.durham.ac.uk/media/durham-university/research-/research-centres/ibru-centre-for-borders-research/maps-and-databases/publications-database/boundary-amp-territory-briefings/btb_1-8.pdf |archive-date=5 August 2021 |url-status=live |via=www.durham.ac.uk |issue=8}}</ref> During [[World War II]], it became an important British base.

Following the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Rafah was located in Egypt-occupied Gaza and consequently, a [[Gaza‚ÄìEgypt border]] did no longer exist. Rafah could grow without any consideration being taken of the old 1906 international boundary.<ref name=kliot_1995 /> In the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel conquered the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and all of the city was now under Israeli occupation.

In 1979, [[Egyptian‚ÄìIsraeli Peace Treaty|Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty]] that returned the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], which borders the Gaza Strip, to Egyptian control. In the Peace Treaty, the re-created Gaza‚ÄìEgypt border was drawn across the city of Rafah. Rafah was divided into an Egyptian and a Palestinian part, splitting up families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Families were separated, property was divided and many houses and orchards were cut across and destroyed by the new boundary, bulldozed, allegedly for security reasons. Rafah became one of the three border points between Egypt and Israel.<ref name="cinderella">{{Cite news |last=Usher |first=Graham |date=22 September 2005 |title=Cinderella in Rafah |work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] Online |issue=761, 22‚Äì28 September 2005 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/761/re1.htm |access-date=9 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022004151/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/761/re1.htm |archive-date=22 October 2005 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref><ref name=kliot_1995 />

== History ==
[[File:Gaza Strip map2.svg|thumb|right|Rafah is at the southern end of the Gaza Strip]]

=== Bronze Age Raphia ===
Rafah has a history stretching back thousands of years. It was first recorded in an inscription of Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti&nbsp;I]], from 1303 BCE as ''Rph'', and as the first stop on Pharaoh [[Shoshenq&nbsp;I]]'s campaign to the [[Levant]] in 925&nbsp;BCE. In 720 BCE it was the site of the [[Assyria]]n king [[Sargon&nbsp;II]]'s victory over the [[Egyptians]].<ref name=STFJ>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/127discuss.html Raphia ‚Äì (Rafah)] Studium Biblicum Franciscanum ‚Äì Jerusalem.</ref>

=== Hellenistic and Roman periods ===
In 217&nbsp;BCE the [[Battle of Raphia]] was fought between the victorious [[Ptolemy IV of Egypt|Ptolemy&nbsp;IV]] and [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus&nbsp;III]].<ref name=STFJ /> It is said to be one of the largest battles ever fought in the Levant, with over a hundred thousand soldiers and hundreds of [[elephant]]s.

[[Antiochus III]], willing to make peace with [[Ptolemy V]], had his daughter [[Cleopatra I]] marry Ptolemy V. Their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia.<ref>Polybius 18.51.10 and 28.20.9; Livy 33.40.3 and 35.13.4; Appian, Syriaca 3.13 and 5.18</ref>

The town was conquered by [[Alexander Yannai]] and held by the [[Hasmonean]]s until it was rebuilt in the time of [[Pompey]] and [[Aulus Gabinius|Gabinius]]; the latter seems to have done the actual work of restoration for the era of the town dates from 57&nbsp;BCE. Rafah is mentioned in [[Strabo]] (16, 2, 31), the [[Antonine Itinerary]], and is depicted on the [[Map of Madaba]].<ref name=STFJ />

=== Byzantine period ===
During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, it was a [[diocese]],<ref name=STFJ /><ref>Joseph Bingham, Origines Ecclesiasticae; Or the Antiquities of the Christian Church and Other Works: In Nine Volumes, Volume 3(Straker, 1843) [https://archive.org/details/originesecclesia02bing/page/61 <!-- quote=Diocese of Raphia. --> p 61].</ref> and [[Byzantine]] [[ceramics]] and [[coin]]s have been found there.<ref>Dauphin, 1998, p. 953</ref> It was represented at the [[Council of Ephesus]] 431 CE by Bishop Romanus, but today remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]<ref>Tadrous Y. Malaty, Introduction to the Coptic Orthodox Church OrthodoxEbooks,1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TrhLRZmCqX8C&q=Raphia&pg=PA13 page 13].</ref> but a small [[Greek Orthodox]] presence exists.

=== Early Muslim to Mamluk periods ===
Rafah was one of the towns captured by the [[Rashidun army]] under general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] in 635 CE, and subsequently was an important trading city during the Early Muslim period.<ref>[[al-Biladhuri]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/xix/mode/1up xix]. Al-Biladhuri lists the cities captured by Amr ibn al-'As as Ghazzah (Gaza), Sebastiya ([[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]]), [[Nabulus]], Amwas ([[Imwas]]), Kaisariyya ([[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]]), [[Yibna]], Ludd ([[Lod|Lydda]]), Rafh (Rafah), [[Bayt Jibrin]], and Yaffa ([[Jaffa]]). Cited in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/28/mode/1up 28]</ref> Under the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s, Rafah was the southernmost border of [[Jund Filastin]] ("District of Palestine"). According to Arab geographer [[al-Ya'qubi]], it was the last town in the Province of Syria and on the road from [[Ramla]] to [[Egypt]].<ref name=LeStrange>le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/517/mode/1up 517]</ref>

A [[Jewish]] community settled in the city in the 9th and 10th centuries and again in the 12th, although in the 11th century, it suffered a decline and in 1080 they migrated to [[Ashkelon]]. A [[Samaritan]] community also lived there during this{{clarify|reason=Which period? C9-10=Abbasid and possibly Fatimid; 12th is Crusader, possibly also Ayyubid rule. Very different.|date=May 2021}} period. Like most cities of southern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], ancient Rafah had a landing place on the coast (now Tell Rafah), while the main city was inland.<ref name=STFJ />

In 1226, Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] writes of Rafah's former importance in the early Arab period, saying it was "of old a flourishing town, with a market, and a [[mosque]], and hostelries". However, he goes on to say that in its current state, Rafah was in ruins, but was an [[Ayyubid]] postal station on the road to Egypt after nearby [[Deir al-Balah]].<ref name="LeStrange" />

=== Ottoman and Egyptian period ===

Rafah appeared in the 1596 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Daftar|tax registers]] as being in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of Gaza of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of [[Gaza Sanjak|Gazza]]. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and/or bee hives.<ref name=Hutteroth>H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 150</ref> In 1799, the French [[Army of the Orient]], led by [[Napoleon]], passed through Rafah during the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]].<ref name=Dwyer>Dwyer, 2007, p. 415</ref> Rafah was the boundary between the provinces of Egypt and Syria. In 1832, the area came under Egyptian occupation of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], which lasted until 1840. 

French explorer [[Victor Gu√©rin]], who visited Rafah in May 1863, noted two pillars of granite which the locals called ''Bab el Medinet,'' meaning "The Gate of the town".<ref>Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog02gu#page/233/mode/1up 233]-35</ref> In 1881, [[Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria]] wrote: "Fragments of gray granite pillars, still standing, are here to be met with about the road, the fields, and the sand, and we saw one lying on the ground half buried... The pillars are the remains of an ancient temple, Raphia, and are of special importance in the eyes of the Arabs, who call them Rafah, as they mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria."<ref>Ludwig Salvator, Archduke of Austria, 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/caravanroutebetw00ludwrich#page/54/mode/1up 54]</ref>

=== British period  ===
[[File:Rafah 1931.jpg|thumb|A map of Rafah in 1931]]

On 9 January 1917, British forces [[Battle of Rafa|captured Rafah]], and subsequently used it as a [[Stage station|staging post]] for their [[First Battle of Gaza (1917)|first attempt to capture Gaza]]. The presence of British military bases in Rafah served an economic draw which led to an influx of internal migration to the city. In the [[1922 census of Palestine]] conducted by the [[Mandate for Palestine|British Mandatory authorities]], Rafah had a population of 599 inhabitants, all of which Muslim.<ref name=Census1922>Barron, 1923, Table V, [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|Sub-district of Gaza]], p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n10/mode/1up  8]</ref> Nine years later, the Mandatory authorities conducted the [[1931 census of Palestine]], by which time Rafah's population had increased to 1,423 residents living in 228 houses, all of which were still Muslim.<ref name=Census1931>Mills, 1932, p. [https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas 6]</ref>

In the [[Village Statistics, 1945]], a joint survey conducted by the Mandatory government's Government Office of Statistics and Department of Lands for the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], Rafah had an all-Muslim population of 2,220 people with 40,579 [[dunam]]s of land.<ref name=1945p12>Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p.

After the [[1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War]], Egypt governed the area (see [[All-Palestine Protectorate|Palestinian Protectorate]]) and refugee camps were established. During the [[Suez Crisis]], 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees, were killed by troops of the [[Israel Defence Force]] in the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, during the [[1956 Rafah massacre]]. The United Nations was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6558F61D3DB6BD4505256593006B06BE |title=A/3212/Add.1 of 15 December 1956 |access-date=2013-08-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104160006/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6558F61D3DB6BD4505256593006B06BE |archive-date=2013-11-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/place.php?plid=210|title=Rafah (articles/books/maps/cartoons/photographs/video or audio clips)|website=cosmos.ucc.ie|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012103645/http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/place.php?plid=210|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israeli forces captured Rafah as part of their invasion of the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. The population was about 55,000, of whom only 11,000 lived in Rafah itself. On Friday, 9 June 1967, the Israeli military bulldozed & blew up 144 houses in Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.<ref name="HC">[[Henry Cattan|Cattan, Henry]] (1969) ''Palestine, The Arabs & Israel.

=== After 1967 ===
In the summer of 1971, the IDF, under General [[Ariel Sharon]] (then head of the [[Israeli Southern Command|IDF southern command]]), destroyed approximately 500 houses in the refugee camps of Rafah in order to create patrol roads for Israeli forces. These demolitions displaced nearly 4,000 people.<ref>[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/858c88eb973847f4802564b5003d1083!OpenDocument UN Doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212181417/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/858c88eb973847f4802564b5003d1083%21OpenDocument |date=2007-02-12 }} A/8389 of 5 October 1971 (h) The continued transfer of the population of the occupied territories to other areas within the occupied territories. Such transfers of population have occurred in the case of several villages that were systematically destroyed in 1967: the population of these villages was either expelled or forced to live elsewhere in the occupied territories. The same practice has been followed in occupied Jerusalem. According to a report in the [[Jerusalem Post]] of 17 May 1971, Mr. [[Teddy Kollek]], Israeli Mayor of Jerusalem, stated that 4,000 Arabs had been evacuated from Jerusalem. Likewise, in the case of Gaza, according to reports appearing in several newspapers and in letters addressed by Governments, several thousands of persons were displaced from the three major refugee camps in Gaza. Official Israeli sources have stated that these transfers of population were necessitated by new security measures, such as the construction of wider roads inside the camps in order to facilitate patrolling and the maintenance of law and order in the camps. Most of the persons whose refugee accommodation was destroyed to permit the construction of these roads were forced to leave for the West Bank and El Arish, while a few were said to have sought refuge with other families inside Gaza. The Special Committee considers that the transfers were unwarranted and that even if the construction of new roads was considered indispensable for the maintenance of law and order, the arbitrary transfer of population was unnecessary, unjustified and in breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention.</ref> Israel established the Brazil and Canada [[housing project]]s to accommodate [[Palestinian refugee|displaced Palestinians]] and to provide better conditions in the hopes of integrating the refugees into the general population and its standard of living;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shaml.org/publications/monos/mono4.htm |title=Publications |access-date=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914074542/http://www.shaml.org/publications/monos/mono4.htm |archive-date=2006-09-14 }}</ref> Brazil is immediately south of Rafah, while Canada was just across the border in Sinai.

During the early months of [[First Intifada]] on 25 April 1989 Rafah resident Khaled Musa Armilat, aged 22, was shot dead by [[Israeli army|Israeli soldiers]] in [[Khan Yunis]]. In a letter to a Member of [[Knesset]], March 1990, Defence Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] stated that the dead man's brother had been interrogated and stated that he had been killed by [[Israel Border Police|Border Police]] but four months later he blamed the [[Israeli army|army]]. Rabin added the matter was being investigated by the [[Israeli Police]].<ref>Talmor, Ronny (translated by Ralph Mandel) (1990) ''The Use of Firearms ‚Äì By the Security Forces in the Occupied Territories.''

Three and a half weeks after Armilat's killing, 19 May, five civilians including a 50-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in Rafah by Israeli soldiers using [[plastic bullets]]. Two of the 12 other casualties later died of their wounds.<ref>B'Tselem information sheet update, June 1989. p.4.

In May 2004, the Israeli Government led by, then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon approved another [[Gaza‚ÄìEgypt border#2004 expansion, Operation Rainbow|mass demolition of homes]] in Rafah. Therefore, he obtained the nickname "the bulldozer".<ref name=hrw_map2>[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/rafah1004/5.htm ''Razing Rafah''], Map 2: Rafah Features. HRW, October 2004</ref>

In September 2005, [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip]] but Rafah remained divided, with part of it on the Egyptian side of the border under Egyptian rule. It has been claimed that it was in order to cope with the division of the town, [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnel|that smugglers have made tunnels]] under the border, connecting the two parts and permitting the smuggling of goods and persons.<ref>[http://www.rafahtoday.org/about/rafah.htm About Rafah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130141739/http://rafahtoday.org/about/rafah.htm |date=2009-01-30}} Rafah Today.</ref>

During the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) war on Gaza, civilians were told to flee to Rafah and [[Gaza Strip evacuations|forcibly displaced from their homes]]. Although the Israeli government declared the southern half of Gaza a safe zone, the IDF proceeded to bomb the region extensively, with a ''[[New York Times]]'' investigation estimating that 2,000-pound bombs were dropped at least 200 times as of 21 December 2023.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Stein |first1=Robin |last2=Willis |first2=Haley |last3=Jhaveri |first3=Ishaan |last4=Miller |first4=Danielle |last5=Byrd |first5=Aaron |last6=Reneau |first6=Natalie |date=2023-12-22 |title=A Times Investigation Tracked Israel's Use of One of Its Most Destructive Bombs in South Gaza |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bomb-investigation.html |access-date=2024-02-09 |work=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> By February 2024, roughly two-thirds of Gaza's population, or 1.4 million people, had been forcibly displaced from other parts of the territory into Rafah, with the IDF declaring its intent to enter the city. Critics have warned about the potential for [[Casualties of the Israel‚ÄìHamas war|mass civilian casualties]] in the event of a [[Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip (2023‚Äìpresent)|ground invasion]], with the [[Secretary-general of the United Nations|UN secretary general]] [[Ant√≥nio Guterres]] arguing that ''"Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences."<ref>{{Cite web |title=UN chief warns of 'age of chaos' as Security Council divided on Gaza |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/un-chief-warns-of-age-of-chaos-as-security-council-stays-divided-on-gaza |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=Al Jazeera}}</ref>'' On 9 February, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] ordered the IDF to create an evacuation plan to remove civilians before launching an offensive against Rafah which is the last major population center in the Gaza Strip still under Hamas control and the elimination of Hamas was considered to be impossible as long as the four Hamas battalions in Rafah are intact.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tal |first1=Amir |last2=Krever |first2=Mick |date=9 February 2024 |title=Netanyahu directs Israeli military to draw up plan to evacuate more than one million people from Rafah as offensive looms |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/09/middleeast/israel-rafah-evacuation-gaza-intl/index.html |access-date=9 February 2024 |work=CNN}}</ref> Prior to the start of the ground invasion, Israel began to intensify its strikes on Rafah from the air.

== Rafah Border Crossing ==
[[File:Border between Israel and Egypt visible from space.jpg|thumbnail|The city of Rafah lies on the border of Egypt and the Gaza Strip]]
Rafah is the site of the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], the sole crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to the [[Palestinian Authority]] in September 2005 as part of the larger [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Israeli withdrawal]] from the Gaza Strip. A [[European Union Border Assistance Mission to Rafah|European Union commission began monitoring]] the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]]'s [[Palestinian Presidential Guard|Presidential Guard]] assumed responsibility for the site on the Palestinian Authority side.<ref>Mitch Potter, Something that works: the Rafah crossing, ''The Toronto Star'', 21 May 2006.</ref> On the Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards as per the agreement signed by Egypt and Israel in November 2005.
