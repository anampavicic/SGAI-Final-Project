Traditionally, the Romanian population was concentrated in the west and southwest of the county, the Hungarians in the east part of the county, and the Germans in the north and around Brașov city.

==Geography==
The county has a total area of {{convert|5363|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

The south side comprises the [[Carpathian Mountains]] ([[Southern Carpathians]] and [[Eastern Carpathians]]), with the [[Făgăraș Mountains]], the [[Bucegi Mountains]], the [[Piatra Mare Mountains]], the [[Piatra Craiului Mountains]], and the [[Postăvarul Massif]]. In the east, there is the {{ill|Brașov Depression|ro|Depresiunea Brașovului}}, and in the west, there is the [[Olt (river)|Olt River]] valley. Between them, there are the [[Perșani Mountains]]. The north and west sides of the county are crossed by the Olt River.

In the southern and central part of Brașov County lies the [[Burzenland]], bordered approximately by [[Apața]] in the north, [[Bran, Brașov|Bran]] in the southwest and [[Prejmer]] in the east, with [[Brașov]] roughly in the center. To the west lies [[Țara Făgărașului]], bordered to the north by the Olt and to the south by the Făgăraș Mountains; its main city is [[Făgăraș]].

==Economy==
Brașov County is one of the most prosperous regions of Romania and has a tradition of industry. During [[Romania in World War II|World War II]], [[IAR 80]] and towards the end of the war, [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]], fighter aircraft were built in Brașov. During the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist period]] the county was heavily industrialized, which left it with some very large industrial complexes. Some of them managed to survive and adapt to the capitalist type market economy, but some did not, leading to a high rate of unemployment. Due to new investments, mainly foreign, the economy managed to partially recover.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The predominant industries in the county are:
* Mechanical and automotive industry.
* Chemical industry.
* Construction materials.
* Food industry.

Around [[Victoria, Romania|Victoria]] there were big chemical complexes that polluted the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Historically, the county was located in the central part of [[Greater Romania]], in the southeastern part of [[Transylvania]]. Its capital was [[Brașov]]. Its territory included the part of the old region of [[Burzenland|Țara Bârsei]]. The county's territory was enlarged as a result of the administrative reform of 1925. Its territory covered the eastern part of today's Braşov County and the south of today's [[Covasna County]].

It was bordered on the west by the counties of [[Făgăraș County|Făgăraș]] and [[Muscel County|Muscel]], to the north by [[Trei Scaune County]], to the east by [[Buzău County#Historical county|Buzău County]], and to the south by the counties of [[Prahova County#Historical county|Prahova]] and [[Dâmbovița County#Historical county|Dâmbovița]].

===History===
Prior to [[World War I]], the territory of the county belonged to [[Austria-Hungary]] and was identical with the [[Brassó County]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After the [[Hungarian–Romanian War]] of 1918–1919, the territory of Brașov County came under the administration of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]; it was formally transferred to Romania from Hungary as the successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the [[Treaty of Trianon]].

In 1938, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] promulgated a new [[1938 Constitution of Romania|Constitution]], and subsequently, he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. [[Former administrative divisions of Romania#Ținuturi: 1938 - 1940|10 ''ținuturi'']] (approximate translation: "lands") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by ''rezidenți regali'' (approximate translation: "Royal Residents") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefects]]. Brașov County became part of [[Ținutul Argeș]].

In 1940, part of the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of [[Northern Transylvania]] under the [[Second Vienna Award]]. In September 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]]. The county was disestablished by the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist government of Romania]] in 1950, when it was incorporated in the larger [[Stalin Region]], renamed Brașov Region in 1960. Brașov County was re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system.

===Administration===
[[File:1938 map of interwar county Brasov.jpg|thumb|right|310px|Map of Brașov County as constituted in 1938.]]

Until the administrative reform of 1925, Brașov County was divided into three administrative districts (''[[plasă|plăși]]''), 23 rural communes, and one urban commune (Brașov).

After 1925, the area of the county was similarly divided into three districts:<ref name=Memoria>{{cite web|url=http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/judete/brasov/|website=Portretul României Interbelice|title=Județul Brașov|lang=ro}}</ref>

===Economy=== 
As a mountain county, agriculture was poorly developed in Brașov. Much of the county's agricultural land was devoted to potatoes, and orchards were planted in hilly areas. Livestock breeding (predominantly cattle and pigs) was an important activity.

Such industry as there was in the county was concentrated in the city of Brașov. In 1925, it had production centers in the chemical, metallurgical, construction, food, textile, machine, pharmaceutical and light industries. Surrounding areas excelled in the metallurgy, extractive, construction, food, textile, and light industries. The city of Brașov was also the main outlet of the county for local products.

Among the natural richness of the county were Zizin's mineral waters, containing sodium bicarbonate, iron, iodine, and carbonic acid. Lignite was exploited at Prejmer, and [[bituminous coal]] at Vulcan and Cristian.
