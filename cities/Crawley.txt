'''Crawley''' ({{Audio|en-uk-Crawley.ogg|}}) is a town and [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]]. It is {{convert|28|mi|km|0}} south of [[London]], {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} north of [[Brighton and Hove]], and {{convert|32|mi|km|0}} north-east of the county town of [[Chichester]]. Crawley covers an area of {{convert|17.36|sqmi|km2|2}} and had a population of 118,493 at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2021|2021 Census]].

The area has been inhabited since [[Three-age system|the Stone Age]],<ref name="Gwynne9">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=9.}}</ref> and was a centre of [[ironwork]]ing in [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. Crawley developed slowly as a [[market town]] from the 13th century, serving the surrounding villages in the [[Weald]]. Its location on the main road from [[London]] to [[Brighton]] brought passing trade, which encouraged the development of [[coaching inn]]s. A rail link to [[London]] opened in 1841.

[[Gatwick Airport]], one of Britain's busiest international airports, opened for commercial flights on the edge of the town in 1933, encouraging commercial and industrial growth. After the [[Second World War]], the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of [[London]] and into [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around [[South East England]]. The [[New Towns Act 1946]] ([[9 & 10 Geo. 6]]. c. 68) designated Crawley as the site of one of these.<ref name="SuppMem">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap23.htm|title=Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions: Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence.

The town contains 14 residential neighbourhoods radiating out from the core of the old market town, and separated by main roads and railway lines. The nearby communities of [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and [[Three Bridges, West Sussex|Three Bridges]] were absorbed into the new town at various stages in its development. In 2009, expansion was being planned in the west and north-west of the town, in cooperation with [[Horsham (district)|Horsham District Council]], which has now become a new neighbourhood named [[Kilnwood Vale]], but it is not in Crawley.<ref name="wnw">{{cite web|url=http://194.201.99.228/Index.htm|title=West and North West of Crawley|access-date=29 October 2009|publisher=Horsham District Council & Crawley Borough Council|year=2006–2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071206125102/http://194.201.99.228/Index.htm |archive-date = 6 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Economically, the town has developed into the main centre of industry and employment between [[London]] and the south coast. Its large industrial area supports manufacturing and service companies, many of them connected with the airport. The commercial and retail sectors continue to expand.<ref name="SuppMem"/>

[[Crawley railway station]], at the southern end of the High Street, was built in 1848 when the [[Arun Valley Line|Horsham branch]] was opened from Three Bridges to Horsham. A line was built eastwards from [[Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line|Three Bridges to East Grinstead]] in 1855. [[Three Bridges, West Sussex|Three Bridges]] had become the hub of transport in the area by this stage: one-quarter of its population was employed in railway jobs by 1861 (mainly at the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]]'s railway works near the station).<ref name="Gray9">{{Harvnb|Gray|1983|p=9.}}</ref> The Longley company—one of [[South East England]]'s largest building firms in the late 19th century, responsible for buildings including [[Christ's Hospital]] school and [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] [[Sanatorium]] in [[Midhurst]]—moved to a site next to Crawley station in 1881.<ref name="longley">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18407|title=Ifield: Economic History|access-date=3 March 2008|publisher=British History Online|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.

===New Town===
In May 1946, the New Towns Act of 1946 identified Crawley as a suitable location for a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]];<ref name="SuppMem"/> but it was not officially designated as such until {{nowrap|9 January 1947}}.<ref name="Gazette">{{London Gazette|issue=37849|page=231|date=10 January 1947}}</ref> The {{convert|5920|acre|ha|0}} of land set aside for the new town were split across the county borders between [[East Sussex]], [[West Sussex]] and [[Surrey]].

Work began almost immediately to prepare for the expansion of the town. A full master plan was in place by 1949. This envisaged an increase in the population of the town to 50,000, residential properties in nine neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north.<ref name="vic"/> The neighbourhoods would consist mainly of three-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties. Each would be built around a centre with shops, a church, a [[public house]], a primary school and a [[community centre]].<ref name="cbc"/> Secondary education was to be provided at campuses at [[Ifield Community College|Ifield Green]], [[Three Bridges, West Sussex|Three Bridges]] and [[Tilgate, Crawley|Tilgate]].<ref name="plan">{{cite journal | title=First proposed structure plan, 1947| journal=Nostalgia: A Crawley Observer Supplement| year=1995| issue=2| page=3}}</ref> Later, a fourth campus, in [[Southgate, West Sussex|Southgate]], was added to the plans.<ref name="masterplan">{{Cite map|title=The Crawley Development Corporation's Master Plan for Crawley New Town|publisher=[[Crawley Development Corporation]]|year=1949}}</ref>

At first, little development took place in the town centre, and residents relied on the shops and services in the existing high street. The earliest progress was in [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]], where new residents moved in during the late 1940s. In 1950 the town was visited by the then heir to the throne, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]], when she officially opened the [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] industrial area. Building work continued throughout the 1950s in [[West Green, West Sussex|West Green]], [[Northgate, Crawley|Northgate]] and [[Three Bridges, West Sussex|Three Bridges]], and later in [[Langley Green, Crawley|Langley Green]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and Ifield. In 1956, land at "Tilgate East" was allocated for housing use, eventually becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Furnace Green, Crawley|Furnace Green]].<ref name="vic"/>

Expectations of the eventual population of the town were revised upwards several times. The 1949 master plan had allowed for 50,000 people, but this was amended to 55,000 in 1956 after the Development Corporation had successfully resisted pressure from the Minister for Town and Country Planning to accommodate 60,000. Nevertheless, plans dated 1961 anticipated growth to 70,000 by 1980, and by 1969 consideration was given to an eventual expansion of up to 120,000.<ref name="vic"/>

Extended shopping facilities to the east of the existing high street were provided. The first stage to open was The Broadwalk in 1954, following by the opening of the Queen's Square development by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] in 1958. Crawley railway station was moved eastwards towards the new development.<ref name="vic"/>

By April 1960, when Thomas Bennett made his last presentation as chairman of the Development Corporation, the town's population had reached 51,700; {{convert|2289000|sqft|m2|-2}} of the factory and other industrial space had been provided; 21,800 people were employed, nearly 60% of whom worked in manufacturing industries, and only seventy people were registered as unemployed. The corporation had built 10,254 houses, and private builders provided around 1,500 more. Tenants were by then permitted to buy their houses and 440&nbsp;householders had chosen to do so by April 1960.<ref name="13years"/>

A new plan was put forward by [[West Sussex County Council]] in 1961. This proposed new neighbourhoods at [[Broadfield, West Sussex|Broadfield]] and [[Bewbush]], both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then [[Urban district (England and Wales)|Urban District Council]]. Detailed plans were made for [[Broadfield, West Sussex|Broadfield]] in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at [[Bewbush]] was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also took place in the area now known as [[Ifield, West Sussex|Ifield West]] on the western fringes of the town.<ref name="vicdates"/>

By 1980, the council identified land at [[Maidenbower]], south of the [[Pound Hill]] neighbourhood, as being suitable for another new neighbourhood, and work began in 1986. However, all of this development was undertaken privately, unlike the earlier neighbourhoods in which most of the housing was owned by the council.<ref name="vicdates"/>

In 1999, plans were announced to develop the 14th neighbourhood on land at [[Tinsley Green, West Sussex|Tinsley Green]] to the northeast of the town; this was given the go ahead in 2011 and is officially the town's 14th neighbourhood, named [[Forge Wood]] after the [[ancient woodland]] that is enclosed within the development.

Crawley became a [[parish]] in the sixteenth century, having previously been a [[chapelry]] in the [[parish]] of [[Slaugham]]. When [[district]] and [[Parish council (England)|parish councils]] were established under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], Crawley was given a [[Parish council (England)|parish council]] and included in the [[Horsham]] [[Rural District]]. The [[parish]] was significantly enlarged in 1933, when it absorbed the neighbouring [[parish]] of [[Ifield, West Sussex|Ifield]].<ref name="visionofbritain.org.uk">{{cite web |title=Crawley Civil Parish / Ancient Parish / Chapelry |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10294800 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=10 September 2022}}</ref>

Following the designation as a New Town in 1947, the [[parish]] of Crawley was enlarged in 1953 to take in territory from the parishes of [[Slaugham]] and [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]]. Three years later, on 1 April 1956, the parish of Crawley was made an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]], making it independent from Horsham Rural District.<ref name="Gwynne165">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=165.}}</ref><ref name="visionofbritain.org.uk"/> The [[Local Government Act 1972]] led to the [[district]] being reformed as a [[borough]] in April 1974,<ref name="arms">{{cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010340&ssTargetNodeId=425&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|title=Coat of Arms|access-date=1 September 2007|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092143/http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010340&ssTargetNodeId=425&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> gaining a mayor for the first time.<ref name="mayor">{{cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010428|title=Past Mayors|access-date=9 April 2008|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111233702/http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010428|archive-date=11 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The new [[borough]] in 1974 also saw its boundaries enlarged, gaining other areas which had been included in the designated area of the New Town as well as the area north of the town including [[Gatwick Airport]], which had previously been in [[Surrey]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The English Non-Metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|year=1972|number=2039|accessdate=10 September 2022}}</ref>

The [[Urban district council|Urban District Council]] received its [[coat of arms]] from the [[College of Heralds]] in 1957. After the change to [[borough]] status a modified coat of arms, based on the original, was awarded in 1976 and presented to the council on 24 March 1977. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town's location at the meeting point of north–south and east–west roads. The shield bears nine [[martlet]]s representing both the county of [[Sussex]] and the new town's original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to the significance of the airport to the locality.

Initially, the [[district]] (and then [[borough]]) council worked with the [[English Partnerships|Commission for New Towns]] on many aspects of development; but in 1978 many of the commission's assets, such as housing and parks, were surrendered to the council.

The [[borough]] remains part of the local two-tier arrangements, with services shared with [[West Sussex County Council]]. The authority is divided into 13&nbsp;wards, each of which is represented by two or three local councillors, forming a total council of 36&nbsp;members. Most wards are coterminous with the borough's neighbourhoods, but three neighbourhoods are divided: [[Broadfield, West Sussex|Broadfield]], [[Northgate, West Sussex|Northgate]], and [[Pound Hill]] into "Pound Hill North and [[Forge Wood]]" and "Pound Hill South and Worth".

=== Climate ===
Crawley lies within the [[Sussex Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Sussex Weald]], an area of highly variable terrain so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, although most of the time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] like the rest of the British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the [[Met Office]] has also published data for its nearby weather station at [[Charlwood]]. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.

Generally, Crawley's inland and southerly position within the UK means temperatures in summer are amongst the highest in the British Isles, [[Charlwood]] recording 36.3C (97.3F)<ref>{{cite web

Sunshine totals in Crawley are higher than many inland areas due to its southerly location: Gatwick averaged 1,574 hours per year over 1961–90. No data is available for 1971 to 2000, but given increases at comparable sites nearby, annual averages are likely to be over 1,600 hours.

Snowfall is often heavier in the [[Sussex Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Sussex Weald]] than in many other low-lying parts of central and [[southern England]] due to the proximity of moisture-laden southerly tracking low-pressure systems bringing easterly winds and snow to areas from [[South London]] southwards. However, again due to the southerly location of the area, with warmer air from the nearby [[English Channel]], the snow is often temporary as low-pressure systems track north bringing in milder air; areas immediately north of [[London Calling|London]] tend to have less accumulation, but lying for a longer duration.

Rainfall is lower than the English average, but higher than many other areas of the South East. 1mm of rain or more falls on 116.7 days of the year.<ref>{{cite web

There are areas which are not defined as neighbourhoods but which are closely associated with Crawley:
* The [[Manor Royal]] industrial estate is in the north of the town. Although it is part of the [[Northgate Ward|Northgate ward]], it is allocated a colour: its street name signs feature the word "Industrial" on a black background.
* Crawley's town centre is in the southernmost part of Northgate. Its street name signs do not follow the standard format of the neighbourhood signs but display only the street name.
* [[Gatwick Airport]] was built on the site of a manor house, Gatwick Manor, close to the village of [[Lowfield Heath]]. Most of the village was demolished when the airport expanded, but the [[Listed building|Grade II*-listed]] [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Lowfield Heath|St Michael and All Angels Church]],<ref name="StMLH">{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/diocesesparishes/rcsale/lowfieldheath.html|title=Lowfield Heath St Michael|access-date=31 March 2008|publisher=The Archbishops' Council|year=2007|work=The Church of England website|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080224175604/http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/diocesesparishes/rcsale/lowfieldheath.html |archive-date = 24 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> remains.

* [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] was originally a village with its own [[civil parish]], lying just beyond the eastern edge of the Crawley urban area and borough boundary;<ref>{{cite map |publisher=Ordnance Survey|title= Sheet 187: Dorking, Reigate and Crawley|year= 1980|scale= 1:50,000|series= Landranger Series of Great Britain}}</ref> but the development of the [[Pound Hill]] and [[Maidenbower]] neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the [[borough]] boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village.

Crawley originally traded as a market town. The [[Crawley Development Corporation|Development Corporation]] intended to develop it as a centre for manufacturing and light engineering, with an industrial zone.<ref name="econhist"/> The rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided opportunities for businesses in the aviation, transport, warehousing and distribution industries. The significance of the airport to local employment and enterprise was reflected by the formation of the Gatwick Diamond partnership. This venture, supported by local businesses, local government and [[South East England Development Agency|SEEDA]], South East England's [[Regional Development Agency]], aims to maintain and improve the Crawley and Gatwick area's status as a region of national and international economic importance.<ref name="gatdiamond">{{cite web|url=http://www.gatwickdiamond.co.uk/|title=The Gatwick Diamond|access-date=2 August 2007|publisher=West Sussex Economic Partnership|year=2007|work=Gatwick Diamond website|archive-date=8 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608021523/http://www.gatwickdiamond.co.uk/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Manufacturing industry ===
Crawley was already a modest industrial centre by the end of the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories.<ref name="Gray16">{{Harvnb|Gray|1983|p=16.}}</ref> In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and [[precision engineering]] and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.<ref name="econhist"/><ref name="Gray16"/>

Industrial development had to take place relatively soon after the new town was established because part of the corporation's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London. Industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle.<ref name="NTA1946-31">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1949|p=31.}}</ref> The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town. A {{convert|267|acre|ha|0|adj=on}}<ref name="NTA1946-31"/> site in the northeastern part of the development area was chosen. Its advantages included flat land with no existing development; proximity to the London–Brighton railway line, the A23 and the planned M23; space for railway sidings (which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged); and an adjacent {{convert|44|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} site reserved for future expansion, on the other side of the railway line (again, not used for this purpose in the end). [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]] (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on 25 January 1950;<ref name="Cole-Misc"/> its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.<ref name="econhist"/>

The Corporation stipulated that several [[Secondary sector of economic activity|manufacturing industries]] should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate. It did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms to build their own premises or rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.<ref name="econhist"/><ref name="Gray33">{{Harvnb|Gray|1983|p=33.}}</ref>

Despite the lack of direct incentives, many firms applied to move to the Manor Royal estate: it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken.<ref name="Gray33"/> One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000.<ref name="econhist"/> By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.<ref name="econhist"/><ref name="Gray34">{{Harvnb|Gray|1983|p=34.}}</ref>

While most of the jobs created in the new town's early years were in manufacturing, the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|tertiary sector]] developed strongly from the 1960s. The [[Manor Royal]] estate, with its space, proximity to Gatwick Airport and good transport links, attracted airport-related services such as logistics, catering, distribution and warehousing; and the corporation and private companies built offices throughout the town.

Even before the new town was planned, Crawley was a retail centre for the surrounding area: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948,<ref name="Gray16"/> 99 of which were on the High Street.<ref name="econhist"/> Early new town residents relied on these shopping facilities until the Corporation implemented the master plan's designs for a new shopping area on the mostly undeveloped land east of the High Street and north of the railway line.<ref name="NTA1946-31"/> The Broadwalk and its 23 shops were built in 1954, followed by the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s.<ref name="vicdates"/> Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name="Gray39">{{Harvnb|Gray|1983|p=39.}}</ref> The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.

The shopping area was also expanded southeastwards from Queen's Square: although the original plans of 1975 were not implemented fully, several large shop units were built and a new pedestrianised link—The Martlets—was provided between Queen's Square and Haslett Avenue, the main road to Three Bridges.<ref name="econhist"/> The remaining land between this area and the railway line was sold for private development by 1982;<ref name="econhist"/> in 1992 a {{convert|450000|sqft|m2|-2}}<ref name="CMsize">{{cite web|url=http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/433|title=Propertymall.com: Crawley, County Mall Shopping Centre|access-date=5 September 2007|publisher=MaxiMalls.com Ltd|year=2007|work=www.propertymall.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928194451/http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/433|archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> shopping centre named County Mall and anchored by an [[Owen Owen]] department store was opened there.<ref name="mall">{{cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=3047252|title=The magnetic North|access-date=21 August 2007|publisher=Property Week|date=25 February 2005|author=Christine Ease|work=www.propertyweek.com|archive-date=27 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201440/http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=3047252|url-status=live}}</ref> Its stores includes major retailers such as [[The Entertainer (retailer)|The Entertainer]], [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[WHSmith]] and [[Superdry]] as well as over 80 smaller outlets.<ref name="shops">{{cite web|url=http://www.standardlifeweb.co.uk/retailerslist.php?user=countymall&all=true|title=Shopping|access-date=21 August 2007|publisher=Standard Life Property|year=2007|work=www.countymall.co.uk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008211838/http://www.standardlifeweb.co.uk/retailerslist.php?user=countymall&all=true|archive-date=8 October 2007}}</ref> The town's main bus station was redesigned, roads including the main A2220 Haslett Avenue were rerouted, and some buildings at the south end of The Martlets were demolished to accommodate the mall.

== Transport ==
Crawley's early development as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton turnpike. The area was joined to the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway network]] in the mid-19th century; and since the creation of the new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a motorway link), a [[guided bus]] transit system and the establishment of an airport which has become one of Britain's largest and busiest.

=== Road ===

The London–Brighton turnpike ran through the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road. When Britain's major roads were classified by the British government's Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923,{{cn|date=September 2024}} it was given the number [[A23 road|A23]]. It was bypassed by a new dual carriageway in 1938<ref name="Baseline11">{{cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/report/int163920.pdf|title=Crawley Baseline Character Assessment|date=May 2009|publisher=EDAW/[[AECOM]]|page=11|access-date=29 October 2009|archive-date=8 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608024540/http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/report/int163920.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> (which forms the A23's current route through the town), and then later to the east side of the town by the [[M23 motorway]], which was opened in 1975. This connects London's orbital motorway, the [[M25 motorway|M25]], to the A23 at [[Pease Pottage]], at the southern edge of Crawley's built-up area. The original single-carriageway A23 became the A2219.

The M23 has junctions in the Crawley area at the A2011/[[A264 road|A264]] (Junction 10) and Maidenbower (area of Crawley) (Junction 10A). The end of the motorway at Pease Pottage is Junction 11. The A2011, another dual-carriageway, joins the A23 in West Green and provides a link, via the A2004, to the town centre. The A2220 follows the former route of the A264 through the town, linking the A23 directly to the A264 at [[Copthorne, West Sussex|Copthorne]], from where it then runs to [[East Grinstead]].

=== Rail ===

The first railway line in the area was the [[Brighton Main Line]], which opened as far as [[Haywards Heath railway station|Haywards Heath]] on 12 July 1841 and reached Brighton on 21 September 1841. It ran through Three Bridges, which was then a small village east of Crawley, and [[Three Bridges railway station|a station]] was built to serve it.<ref name="VicKeithTBB4">{{Harvnb|Mitchell|Smith|1986a|p=4.}}</ref>

The urban area of Crawley is served by a total of three rail stations including [[Ifield railway station]]. Due to Crawley's expansion this station is now surrounded by the town's western areas. Opened as ''Lyons Crossing Halt'' on 1 June 1907 to serve the village of Ifield, it was soon renamed ''Ifield Halt'', dropping the "Halt" suffix in 1930.<ref name="VicKeithCL15">{{Harvnb|Mitchell|Smith|1986b|p=15.}}</ref>
