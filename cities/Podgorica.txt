'''Podgorica'''{{efn|name=native name 1|Written identically in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]].}}{{efn|name=native name 2|{{lang-sq|Podgoricë}}.}} ({{lang-cnr-Cyrl|Подгорица}},{{efn|name=native name 4|Written identically in [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]}} {{IPA|sh|pǒdɡoritsa|pron}}; {{lit|under the hill}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities and towns in Montenegro|largest city]] of [[Montenegro]]. The city is just north of [[Lake Skadar]] and close to coastal destinations on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Historically, it was Podgorica's position at the confluence of the [[Ribnica River|Ribnica]] and [[Morača River|Morača]] rivers and at the meeting-point of the fertile [[Zeta Plain]] and [[Bjelopavlići Valley]] that encouraged settlement. The surrounding landscape is predominantly mountainous terrain.

After [[World War II]], Podgorica was first designated as the capital of Montenegro in 1946. At that time, it was renamed Titograd in honor of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the leader of [[Yugoslavia]]. It served as the capital of the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until Montenegro's declaration of independence in 2006, after which it was reaffirmed as the capital of an independent Montenegro. The city's original name, Podgorica, was restored in 1992 following the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

The economy of Podgorica is based on a mix of industries, including manufacturing, trade, and services. The city has seen a rise in the IT sector, with numerous startups and tech companies emerging. Podgorica serves as a central hub for Montenegro's transportation network, with an extensive road and rail system and the nearby [[Podgorica Airport]]. Tourism is also a growing sector, with the city being a gateway to Montenegro's natural and cultural attractions.

Podgorica is home to the [[University of Montenegro]], the largest and most significant educational institution in the country. The city's cultural institutions include the Montenegrin National Theatre, the Natural History Museum of Montenegro, and several galleries and libraries. About one-third of the city's area is composed of parks, gardens, and natural landscapes, including the nearby Gorica Hill.

Prominent landmarks in Podgorica include the Millennium Bridge, the Clock Tower, and the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ. The city also features historical sites such as the ancient Roman settlement of Doclea and the old Ottoman town of Stara Varoš.

==Etymology==
Podgorica is written in [[Cyrillic]] as '''Подгорица''', {{IPA|sh|pǒdɡoritsa|pron}}; {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|ɒ|d|ɡ|ɒr|ɪ|t|s|ə|,_|p|ɒ|d|ˈ|ɡ|ɔːr|-}},<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John C. |author-link=John C.

''Gorica'' ({{lang-cyrl|Горица}}), a diminutive of the word Gora (Cyrillic: Гора) which is another word for Mountain or Hill, means "little/small hill", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlooks the city center. Some three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (city)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]]'s mother hailed. In later centuries, Romans "corrected" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|[[Duklja]]}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of same word. At its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called {{ill|Birziminium{{!}}'''Birziminium'''|sr|Бирзиминијум}}. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' ({{lang-cyrl|Рибница}}, {{IPA|sh|rîbnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' ({{lang-cyrl|Титоград}}, {{IPA|sh|tîtoɡraːd|}}) in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the [[List of heads of state of Yugoslavia#SFR Yugoslavia|President]] of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from 1953 to 1980. In 1992 the city changed its name to "Podgorica", which it remains today.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (Illyria)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]]]]
[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea]]
Podgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Morača]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Morača)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].

In the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavlići plain|Bjelopavlići valleys]] was populated by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000–10,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{cvt|10|km|0}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favorable climate, and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.

The name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nikšić]]. As a busy crossroads, Podgorica was a vibrant regional center of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength, and strategic importance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474. Podgorica became a [[Qadaa|kaza]] of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] (which was historically led by Albanian Pashas). In 1479, The Ottomans built a [[Depedogen|large fortress]] in Podgorica, and the existing settlement, with its highly developed merchant connections, became the main Ottoman defensive and attacking bastion in the region. At the beginning of 1474 the Ottoman sultan intended to rebuild Podgorica and [[Baleč]] and settle them with 5,000 Muslim families (most of them of Albanian or Slavic origin),<ref>{{cite web |last=Božić |first=Ivan |title=Nemirno pomorje XV veka |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2AeAAAAMAAJ&q=%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%87 |year=1979 |publisher=Srpska književna zadruga |location=Beograd |language=sr |oclc=5845972 |page=295 |quote=почетком 1474 ... о султановој намери да обнови Подгорицу и да је насели са пет хиљада турских домаћинстава, а исто тако да подигне из рушевина стари град Балеч |access-date=19 November 2020 |archive-date=10 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410101548/https://books.google.com/books?id=X2AeAAAAMAAJ&q=%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%87 |url-status=live}}</ref> in order to stop cooperation between the [[Principality of Zeta]] and [[Albania Veneta]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ćorović |first=Vladimir |title=Istorija Srba |year=2005 |publisher=Zoograf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGotAQAAIAAJ&q=%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%87 |access-date=21 January 2012 |page=357 |isbn=978-86-7578-127-1 |language=sr |quote=...очвидно из разлога да спрече везе између Зећана и Албанаца |archive-date=10 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410101648/https://books.google.com/books?id=IGotAQAAIAAJ&q=%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%87 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Podgorica fell again, but this time to the Ottomans in 1484, and the character of the town changed extensively. The Ottomans fortified the city, building towers, gates, and defensive ramparts that give Podgorica the appearance of an Ottoman military city.

Most of today's Montenegro and Podgorica fell under the rule of the Albanian [[Bushati]] Family of Shkodra between 1760 and 1831, which ruled independently from the Imperial authority of the Ottoman Sultan.

In 1864, Podgorica became a ''kaza'' of the [[Scutari Vilayet]] called Böğürtlen ("blackberry", also known as Burguriçe).

The end of the Montenegrin-Ottoman War in 1878 resulted in the [[Congress of Berlin]] recognizing vast territories, including that of Podgorica, as part of the newly recognized [[Principality of Montenegro]]. At that time there were about 1,500 houses in Podgorica, with more than 8,000 people living there – of Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Muslim faiths flourishing together.

After the [[Berlin Congress]] in 1878, Podgorica was annexed to the Principality of Montenegro, marking the end of four centuries of Ottoman rule, and the beginning of a new era for Podgorica and Montenegro. The first forms of capital concentration were seen in 1902 when roads were built to all neighboring towns, and tobacco became Podgorica's first significant commercial product. In 1904, a [[savings bank]] named Zetska formed the first significant financial institution; this would soon grow into Podgorička Bank.

[[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|World War I]] marked the end of dynamic development for Podgorica, which by then was the largest city in the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. On 10 August 1914, nine military personnel and 13 civilians were killed in Podgorica from an aerial bombardment by [[Austro-Hungarian Aviation Troops]].<ref name="NBP">{{cite news |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:428126-Podgorica-Pustos-ostaje-ispod-bombi |author=Veliša Kadić |newspaper=[[Večernje novosti]] |title=Podgorica: Pustoš ostaje ispod bombi |language=sr |date=7 April 2013 |access-date=22 September 2019 |archive-date=22 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922222036/http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:428126-Podgorica-Pustos-ostaje-ispod-bombi |url-status=live}}</ref> The city was bombed three more times in 1915.<ref name="NBP"/> Along with the rest of the Kingdom, Podgorica was occupied by [[Austria-Hungary]] from 1916 to 1918.

After the liberation by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1918, the controversial [[Podgorica Assembly]] marked the end of Montenegrin statehood, as Montenegro was merged with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. The population of urban Podgorica during this interwar period was approximately 14,000.<ref name="PK">{{cite web |url=http://www.privrednakomora.me/saopstenja/imperijal-bio-najljepsi |work=Privredna komora Crne Gore |title="Imperijal" bio najljepši |language=sr |date=5 August 2013 |access-date=9 June 2019 |archive-date=6 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806071902/http://www.privrednakomora.me/saopstenja/imperijal-bio-najljepsi }}</ref>

During the interwar period (1918–1941), Podgorica had public bathrooms as most residents did not have their own.<ref name="PK"/> However, the ''Imperial'' hotel built in 1925 had two bathrooms, which was unprecedented at the time.<ref name="PK"/> It was one of at least six hotels built in the city during the interwar period.<ref name="PK"/>

===Socialist Yugoslavia===
On 12 July 1946, [[Josip Broz Tito]] made one of his early visits to Podgorica from the ''Radovče'' hotel, where he spoke to a crowd.<ref name="DTV">{{cite web |url=https://www.vijesti.me/forum/dolazi-tito-876935 |author=Slobodan Vuković |work=[[Vijesti]] |title=Dolazi Tito |language=sr |format=via [[Wayback Machine]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302095051/https://www.vijesti.me/forum/dolazi-tito-876935 |archive-date=2 March 2016}}</ref> It was the first of fifteen total visits made by Tito to the city after World War II.<ref name="DTV"/>

On 25 July 1948, the vice president of the People's Parliament of Montenegro, Andrija Mugoša, along with secretary Gavron Cemović, signed a law changing the name of Podgorica into "Titovgrad".<ref name="VTG"/> The law was "retroactively" activated such that the name change applied to any records starting from 13 July 1946, when it became the capital of [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] within [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|the newly formed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].<ref name="VTG"/> However, in a contradiction, the "Službeni list" or legal code of Yugoslavia recorded the name "Titograd" without the letter "v".<ref name="VTG"/> Ultimately, "Titograd" was used over "Titovgrad".<ref name="VTG"/>

In addition to the new name, Titograd saw the establishment of new factories. The Radoje Dakić factory, built-in 1946 for the production of heavy machinery, became one of the largest employers in Titograd.

===Contemporary history===
As [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia began to break up]], Titograd was renamed to Podgorica after a referendum on 2 April 1992.<ref name="ZU">{{cite web |url=https://portalanalitika.me/clanak/240393/zivjeti-i-umrijeti-u-titogradu |work=Portal Analitika |author=Željko Vukmirović |title=Živjeti i umrijeti u Titogradu |language=sr |date=17 August 2016 |access-date=31 January 2019 |archive-date=1 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201015752/https://portalanalitika.me/clanak/240393/zivjeti-i-umrijeti-u-titogradu |url-status=live}}</ref> On 25 May 1992, Podgorica was the site of a [[Serbian Radical Party]] rally of approximately 10,000 supporters, during which a [[Bosniaks of Montenegro|Montenegrin Bosniak]] man named Adem Šabotić attempted to assassinate [[Vojislav Šešelj]] via hand bomb after his supporters chanted references to killing [[Muslims]].<ref name="BHASPG">{{cite web |url=https://bh-magazin.com/2021/01/31/sudbina-atentatora-na-seselja-znate-li-pricu-o-ademu-saboticu/ |author=Avdo Huseinović |website=BH MAGAZINE |title=Sudbina atentatora na Šešelja: Znate li priču o Ademu Šabotiću? |language=Bosnian |date=31 January 2021 |access-date=19 December 2021 |archive-date=19 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211219223031/https://bh-magazin.com/2021/01/31/sudbina-atentatora-na-seselja-znate-li-pricu-o-ademu-saboticu/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Šešelj, his bodyguards, and a few bystanders were injured after the bomb detonated but no one was killed.<ref name="BHASPG"/>

Otherwise, the [[Yugoslav wars]] largely bypassed Podgorica, but the entire country was greatly affected with severe economic stagnation and hyperinflation lasting throughout the 1990s due to [[Sanctions against Yugoslavia|international sanctions]]. In 1999, Podgorica was subject to airstrikes during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].<ref name="APPN">{{cite news |date=29 April 1999 |title=Montenegro: Nato Bombing Attacks Latest |via=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8ECEr6lz74 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200425045701/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8ECEr6lz74&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=25 April 2020 |url-status=live |access-date=16 March 2019 |work=[[Associated Press]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="WPPN">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/montenegro050399.htm?noredirect=on |author=William Booth |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=NATO Bombs Hit Montenegro Homes |page=A31 |date=3 May 1999 |access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Podgorica Municipal building.jpg|thumb|left|Podgorica City Hall and the monument to [[Marko Miljanov Popović]]]]
The city administration consists of a mayor, city [[deliberative assembly|assembly]], and a number of secretariats and administrative bodies which together act as a city local government. The city assembly has 61 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for a five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during the term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/ |title=Tuzi became its own Municipality. |access-date=1 March 2019 |archive-date=20 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120215936/https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

On local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] won 17 seats, [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|SNP]] won 8 seats, while coalition made of [[Positive Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]] won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna and made an arrangement on forming a majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is a longtime partner of DPS at the national level, it has been in opposition to Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010–2014 period.
Since October 2014, the position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepović, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugoša]]. Since October 2018, the position of the Mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|DPS]] Vice president [[Ivan Vuković (politician)|dr Ivan Vuković]], replacing Slavoljub Stijepović. On 13 April 2023, [[Olivera Injac]] from [[Europe Now!|PES]] was sworn in as mayor, thus becoming the first non-DPS mayor since 1998.

===Local subdivisions===
{{Main|Podgorica Capital City|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}

The entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 66 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (мјесне заједнице, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.

==Geography==
Podgorica is located in central Montenegro. The area is crossed with rivers and the city itself is only {{convert|15|km}} north of [[Lake Skadar]]. The [[Morača River|Morača]] and [[Ribnica River|Ribnica]] rivers flow through the city, while the [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Cijevna River|Cijevna]], [[Sitnica River|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] flow nearby. ''Morača'' is the largest river in the city, being {{cvt|70|m|ft|disp=or}} wide near downtown, and having carved a {{cvt|20|m|ft|disp=or}} deep canyon for the length of its course through the city. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Except for the Morača and Zeta, other rivers have an appearance of small creeks. The richness in bodies of water is a major feature of the city.

In contrast to most of Montenegro, Podgorica lies in a mainly flat area at the northern end of the Zeta plain, at an elevation of {{cvt|40|m|ft}}. The only exceptions are hills which overlook the city. The most significant is {{cvt|130.3|m|ft}} high '''[https://podgorica.travel/en/nature-parks-and-picnic-sports/ Gorica Hill]''' ({{IPA|sh|ˈɡǒrit͜sa|pron}}), city's namesake, which rises above the city centre. The other hills include ''Malo brdo'' ("little hill", {{cvt|205.4|m|ft|disp=or}}), ''Velje brdo'' ("big hill", {{cvt|283|m|ft|disp=or}}), [https://podgorica.travel/en/nature-parks-and-picnic-sports/ '''Ljubović'''] ({{cvt|101|m|ft|disp=or}}) and ''Dajbapska gora'' ({{cvt|172|m|ft|disp=or}}).
Podgorica city proper has an area of {{convert|108|km2|sqmi}}, while actual urbanized area is much smaller.

===Climate===
[[File:Podgorica, piazza repubblica.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Republic Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]].]]
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Podgorica is transitional between a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa''), since the driest summer month gets slightly less than {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} of precipitation,<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal |author=Peel, M.

Although the city is only some {{cvt|35|km|0}} north of the [[Adriatic Sea]], an arm of the Mediterranean, [[Rumija|Mount Rumija]] acts as a natural barrier, separating Skadar Lake basin and Podgorica area from the sea, thus limiting temperate maritime influence on the local climate.

The mean annual rainfall is {{cvt|1659|mm|in}}, making Podgorica by far the wettest capital in Europe, [[Ljubljana]] being second with {{cvt|1362|mm|in}}. The temperature exceeds {{cvt|25|°C}} on about 135 days each year.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The number of rainy days is about 120, and those with a strong wind around 60.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} An occasional strong northerly wind influences the climate in the winter, with a [[wind chill]] effect lowering the perceived temperature by a few degrees. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The all-time maximum snowfall record was beaten on 11 February 2012, when {{cvt|58|cm|0}} of snowfall were measured. Before that, the biggest snowfall in Podgorica was in 1954, when {{cvt|52|cm|0}} of snowfall was recorded. Maximum temperature was recorded on 24 August 2007, at {{cvt|44.8|°C}}, while all time minimum was {{cvt|-9.7|°C}}, on 4 February 1956.

Podgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].

The Orthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East–West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the city including St. George Church which originates from the 11th century, and the [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.

}}

The [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]] as well as [[Albanians]]. There are several [[mosques]] in Podgorica.

The Catholic population mainly consists of the local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

==Economy==
Podgorica is not only the administrative center of Montenegro but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Before World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacturing, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book |title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju |year=1984 |edition=3rd |publisher=Sveučilišna naklada Liber |location=Zagreb |language=hr |editor1-first=Radovan |editor1-last=Radovinović |editor2-first=Ivan |editor2-last=Bertić}}</ref>

[[File:Central Bank of Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[Central Bank of Montenegro]]]]

In the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Plantaže]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.

As Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from the increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Air Montenegro|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.

The large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid net salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in December 2021 was €537 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |access-date=2014-10-13 |archive-date=19 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019193934/http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Tourism===
Further cultural and historic monuments in and around Podgorica are Sahat kula (Clock tower) Adži-paše Osmanagića, the ruins of the Ribnica fortress, remnants of the city of Doclea, Stara Varoš, and Vezirov most (Vizier's bridge). Podgorica has excellent transit connections with other centres.

At nine kilometres from the city is the International Airport, with railway and bus stations close to one another.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visit-montenegro.com/destinations/podgorica/ |title=Podgorica |publisher=Visit Montenegro |date=2022-06-06 |archive-date=22 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422163828/https://www.visit-montenegro.com/destinations/podgorica/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Media===
Podgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[Radio and Television of Montenegro|RTCG]]. It has also its local TV and radio station Gradska. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[TV Vijesti]], [[Prva TV]], [[Nova M]] and [[Adria TV]].
All Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica.

==Transport==

===Public transport===

Public transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |title=Saobraćaj |publisher=Podgorica.me |access-date=2013-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325043642/http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |archive-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> The city-owned ''AD Gradski saobraćaj'' public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers. As of 2023 Public transport in Podgorica is done only by buses, 12 city and 16 suburban lines.

Public transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation. Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.

===Roads===
Podgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo–Božaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The first phase of motorway A-1 (Bar-Boljare) was opened on July 13, 2022. The [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. A new road bypass had been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city center. A south-western bypass had also been constructed with the same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic of its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner-city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Morača River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.

The main transit connections of Podgorica are:
* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe
* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nikšić]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe
* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]
* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]

===Rail===
[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]]]]
Podgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]]. The [[Belgrade–Bar railway|Belgrade–Bar]] line converges with the [[Nikšić-Podgorica railway|line to Nikšić]] and [[Podgorica–Shkodër railway|line to Shkodër]] at the [[Podgorica Rail Station]]. The station itself is located {{cvt|1.5|km|2}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade–Bar. The link to [[Nikšić]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718 |title=U Željeznicu ulažu 52 miliona eura |access-date=16 May 2009 |archive-date=11 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611004629/http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718 |url-status=live}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkodër]] is used as freight-only.

===Air===
[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|left|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]
[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{cvt|11|km|mi}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (Аеродром Голубовци / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of [[Golubovci]]. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened. It is the main hub for [[Air Montenegro]] and [[Di Air]].

The [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (CANU) is in Podgorica, as well as the parallel scholars' academy [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts|DANU]].

There are a number of private institutions for higher education including the [[Mediterranean University]] which was founded in 2006 as the first private university in Montenegro and the [[University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium "Slobodan Škerović"]] which first opened in 1907. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The "Radosav Ljumović National Library" is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.

==Culture==
[[File:CNPPG.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]].]]

Podgorica is home to many Montenegrin cultural institutions and events. It hosts the [[Montenegrin National Theatre]] and a number of museums and galleries. The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozorište''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:
* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical, and cultural-historical. It houses artifacts that date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheološka istraživanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.
* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro.
* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnjački muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[National Museum of Montenegro|Podgorica City Museum]].]]
There is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrović|''Petrovića'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrović Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. The palace hosted the [[Gallery of the Non-Aligned Countries "Josip Broz Tito"]] between 1984 and 1995. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjanički Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at BIG Podgorica shopping mall.

A significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomović Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomović''). It is a public institution that organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgoričko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT – International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS – December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetnička Scena'').

==Sport==
The most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budućnost Podgorica|KK Budućnost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.

Football in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budućnost Podgorica|Budućnost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatović]] and [[Dejan Savićević]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nikšić|Sutjeska]] from Nikšić, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].
Other clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[FK Podgorica]] from ''Donja Gorica''.

The volleyball team [[OK Budućnost Podgorica|OK Budućnost]] and the women's handball team [[ŽRK Budućnost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budućnost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.

[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedić]], are born in Podgorica.

Sporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon|Podgorica Marathon, Coinis no limits Triathlon]], and the ''Morača River'' jumps attract international competitors.
Podgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].

===Venues===

Podgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:
* [[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budućnost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.
* [[Morača Sports Center]], a multi-functional indoor sports facility. It has a capacity of 6,000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vršac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].

Podgorica's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country: as one régime replaced another, the corresponding style was introduced.

As part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1878, Podgorica has some examples of Ottoman architecture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The oldest parts of the city, [https://podgorica.travel/en/monuments-of-culture/ ''Stara Varoš'' (''Old town'')] and ''Drač'' is typical of this, with two mosques, a Turkish [[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|'''Clock Tower''']] and narrow, winding streets.

When the city was incorporated to Montenegro, the urban core shifted to the other bank of the [[Ribnica River]], where the town developed in a more European style: wider streets with an [[orthogonal]] layout. This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as the city center and is called ''Nova Varoš'' (''New town'').

During World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 80 times]].<ref name="Kovacevic57" /> After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Morača River]] was built this way.

The main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of the city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today's Podgorica and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

A major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in the city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares and some monuments. New landmarks include the ''Hristovog Vaskrsenja'' [[Orthodox temple (church)|orthodox temple]] and the [[Millennium Bridge, Podgorica|Millennium Bridge]], the main feature of the Podgorica skyline.
