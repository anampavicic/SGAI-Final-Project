'''Las Piñas''' ({{IPA|tl|las ˈpiɲɐs|lang}}, officially the '''City of Las Piñas''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Las Piñas}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 606,293 people.{{PH census|current}}

Las Piñas was sixth in [[MoneySense (Philippines)|MoneySense Philippines]] "Best Places To Live" report in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|last=moneysense|date=April 1, 2008|title=Best places to live|url=https://www.moneysense.com.ph/best-places-to-live/|access-date=January 9, 2021|website=MoneySense Philippines|language=en-US}}</ref> Attractions include [[Evia Lifestyle Center]], [[SM Southmall]], [[Robinsons Place Las Piñas]] and [[Las Piñas–Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area|Las Piñas - Parañaque Wetland Park]].

==Etymology==
The story about the true origin of the city's name, "Las Piñas", varies. One version mentioned, that traders from the province of [[Cavite]] and [[Batangas]] shipped their first ''piñas'' (Spanish for [[pineapple]]s) for sale to this town before they were distributed to nearby markets. Another version related that it was "Las Peñas" (the rocks), evident by the quarrying of stones and [[adobe]] which were used to construct buildings and bridges. The old [[church bell]] from St. Joseph Parish Church [[Bellfounding|founded]] by Diego Cera has been preserved inside the church museum. An inscription on the bell states, "Siendo cura del pueblo de Laspeñas el M.R.P. Padre Diego Cera se fundió este equilón año de 1820," showing that even during the time of Diego Cera, the town's first parish priest, the town was called "Las Peñas", for some time and eventually was renamed "Las Piñas".<ref>Pransism (2011-11).

===Spanish colonial era===

Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of [[Manila Bay]]. It was proclaimed as a province of [[Manila]] either in 1762 or 1797.

Las Piñas was formerly called "Las Pilas" due to its separation from Parañaque due to tribal conflicts. On the other hand, Manuel Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buzeta|first1=Manuel|title=Diccionario geográfico, estadístico, histórico de las Islas Filipinas ... / por Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo|date=1851|publisher=Imprenta de José C. de la Peña|location=Madrid|url=http://bibliotecadigital.jcyl.es/i18n/consulta/registro.cmd?id=2046}}</ref> Felix Timbang was the first ''gobernadorcillo'' in 1762, while Mariano Ortiz was the first municipal president of the town of Las Piñas.<ref name="Augustinian">{{cite book|last=Salonga|first=Isayas R.|title=Rizal Province Directory: History, Government and General Information with the Full Text of the Philippine Independence Law, Volume One |date=1934|publisher=General Printing Press}}</ref>

Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824. In 1880, the city experienced an outbreak of cholera and smallpox leading to the loss of many lives. Years later, Las Piñas also became a central battleground between Spanish and Philippine forces during the [[Philippine Revolution]].<ref name="alabangbulletin.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.alabangbulletin.com/a-brief-history-of-las-pinas/|title=A Brief History of Las Pinas|work=Alabang Bulletin|date=May 31, 2012|access-date=December 26, 2020}}</ref>

The town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by forces of General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].

===American invasion era===
In 1901, the municipality of Las Piñas, previously a part of the [[Manila (province)|province of Manila]], was incorporated to the newly created province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] pursuant to the [[Philippine Commission]] Act No. 137. On October 12, 1903, in accordance with Act No. 942, it was combined with the town of [[Parañaque]], with the latter as the seat of a new municipal government.<ref>{{cite act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|index=942|date=October 12, 1903|access-date=April 24, 2022|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen.}}</ref>

It was separated from Parañaque to become an independent municipality again on March 27, 1907, by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625.<ref>{{cite act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l4d28|index=1625|date=March 27, 1907|access-date=April 24, 2022}}</ref>

===Japanese occupation era===
The town was occupied by the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and liberated by the combined American and Filipino forces.

===Philippine independence===
On November 7, 1975, through Presidential Decree No. 824, Las Piñas was excised from the province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] to form [[Metro Manila]]. Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=PD|number=824|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1975/11/07/presidential-decree-no-824-s-1975/|date=November 7, 1975|title=Creating The Metropolitan Manila And The Metropolitan Manila Commission And For Other Purposes |access-date=June 5, 2022}}</ref>

===Religion===
{{See also|Religion in the Philippines|List of Roman Catholic churches in Metro Manila}}
People in Las Piñas are mainly Roman Catholic. Catholic churches in Las Piñas fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Diocese of Parañaque]].  Las Piñas is home of the 2 prominent pilgrim Catholic Shrine: [[Las Piñas Church|Diocesan Shrine of St. Joseph Parish]] and Diocesan Shrine of the Five Wounds of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

==Economy==

=== Coconout livelihood ===
Coconut shells and husks, which were discarded by coconut vendors, previously blocked the rivers of Las Piñas and Zapote. Currently, coco coir nets are being utilized for lining the riverbanks. 

This efficient natural alternative for flood prevention is 80% more cost-effective than traditional riprap techniques such as cement and stone and is also effective for stopping soil erosion. 

Like a beehive comb, the net is woven to create openings for plant growth within the cells, allowing their long roots to help secure the soil. The coco coir net is more resistant to sun and water damage compared to plastic nets, making it more durable. Additionally, it is eco-friendly because the material breaks down gradually into tiny pieces that enrich the soil. 

Additional applications for coir fiber involve utilizing it as a potting material for horticulture purposes, in hydroponic systems, and for managing erosion. 

The different ways in which it is used have led to a higher need for the coconet, providing a means of income for several Las Piñas locals who turn coconut husks into nets through weaving. 

The Las Piñas city officials have given out twining and weaving tools and offered electrical assistance to its residents who have turned coconet weaving into their personal family venture. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Coconut Livelihood |url=https://laspinascity.gov.ph/lifestyle/22/coconut-livelihood |access-date=|website=The Official Website of the City of Las Piñas}}</ref>

=== Salt-making industry ===
{{main|Salt industry in Las Piñas}}

During the 18th century, the fishing village of Las Piñas adopted salt-making techniques with the use of solar dry beds. Over the years, numerous hectares encircling the ancient town were transformed into salt beds named "irasan". 

Afterwards, clay tiles or gibak were transported from as distant as Vigan to cover the salt beds. This kept the salt from touching the ground, resulting in the salt turning as white as snow and making Las Piñas known as a hub for salt production. 

At the time of harvesting, Las Piñas was adorned with small white crystal pyramids. The salt was sorted and categorized into tertia, segunda, and primera grades. 

Tertia salt was the darkest in color and had the highest amount of impurities. Dry ice was combined with this salt to keep ice cream fresh. 

Segunda salt was utilized for the purpose of preserving fresh fish. Navotas and Malabon were the primary purchasers of segunda salt among the wholesale seafood trading communities. 

However, Las Piñas was renowned for its high-quality salt, also known as primera, rumored to be as white as snow. The initial batch of salt was delivered to every public market in Manila and utilized to enhance the taste of gourmet meals. 

The bay area's restoration and the resulting Coastal Road construction caused interference with salt production. The dredging and construction activities hindered fishermen from venturing out to the ocean. Most of the salt being produced started entering the cheaper segunda and tertia categories. Salt that was brought in from countries such as China and India was available for purchase at reduced costs. The salt production industry in Las Piñas has come to an end and is now just a reminiscence of the past.

In 2005, an Irasan Center was constructed where visitors could view a salt bed demonstration in commemoration of Las Piñas’ once much celebrated industry.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Salt-making industry |url=https://laspinascity.gov.ph/lifestyle/24/salt-making-industry |access-date= |website=The Official Website of the City of Las Piñas}}</ref>

===Railway===
Las Piñas is part of the route of the extension of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|LRT Line 1]], the South Extension Project.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/04/24/1911966/start-lrt-1-extension-moved-may|title=Start of LRT-1 extension moved to May|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=July 29, 2019}}</ref> The actual construction officially started on Tuesday, May 7, 2019<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/05/07/19/construction-on-lrt-1-extension-to-cavite-starts|title=Construction on LRT-1 extension to Cavite starts|last=Manabat|first=Jacque|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=July 29, 2019}}</ref> because the [[Right-of-way (property access)|Right-of-way]] is "free and clear" from obstructions. Once it is fully operational, Las Piñas will be served by the LRT Line 1 through the [[Las Piñas station]] and [[Zapote station]].<ref name=":0" />

{{as of|2024|04|30|df=US}}, phase 1 is 98.2% complete. [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] Executive Assistant Jonathan Gesmundo announced the construction of 8 additional stations to the current 20 LRT-1 stations with operations of LRT-1 Cavite Extension Phase 1 are expected by mid-November 2024. Meanwhile, phases 2 and 3 will begin operations by 2031.

===Road network===
[[File:Ph map laspinas.png|thumb|Map of Las Piñas]]
[[File:Calle Real Las Piñas.jpg|thumb|Alabang-Zapote Road (N411) in 2011. The road continually suffers from perennial traffic congestion resulting from increasing traffic.]]
The road network of Las Piñas are radial in nature, and primarily relies on the [[Alabang–Zapote Road]] (N411), which serves as the city's road network backbone. The [[Manila-Cavite Expressway]] (formerly Coastal Road, and numbered E3), a toll expressway serves as the major traffic route towards [[Manila]]. [[Daang Hari Road|Daang Hari]], which hugs near the boundary with [[Muntinlupa]], and the [[Aguinaldo Highway]] (N62) are the major traffic routes toward [[Cavite]]. The [[Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway]] (MCX), which leads to [[South Luzon Expressway]], supplements Daang Hari as an alternative to the congested Alabang-Zapote Road over [[Alabang]] and [[Ayala Alabang]] in Muntinlupa.

The road network in Las Piñas suffers from [[Traffic congestion|traffic jam]]s, especially on the primary artery, Alabang-Zapote Road, which carried more than 70,000 vehicles daily as of 2016. Public transport, like buses and jeepneys, fill up Alabang-Zapote Road, therefore causing further congestion. The city government petitioned the [[Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board]] (LTFRB) to suspend issuing of franchises on bus and jeepneys routes that uses Alabang-Zapote Road.

The Las Piñas Friendship Route network serves as the alternate routes on the congested routes, but motorists have to obtain and display a sticker on their vehicle to use these routes, as most roads of the network are located in privately owned subdivisions ([[Gated community|gated communities]]), like [[BF Homes]], Pilar Village, and BF Resort.

====Public transport====
Jeepneys and buses form the major public transport system, and most of their routes follow the Alabang-Zapote Road. Most jeepneys through Las Piñas travel between Alabang and Zapote, within the city, or [[Baclaran]], in Parañaque. Buses usually form routes between Alabang or [[SM Southmall]] and destinations in Manila. Buses and jeepneys are blamed for the worsening congestion on Alabang-Zapote Road.
