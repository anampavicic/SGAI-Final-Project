Rasht is the largest city on Iran's [[Caspian Sea]] coast. Due to being between the coast and the mountains, the local environment is rainy with a [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] climate. It also has [[temperate rainforest]] to its south, contrasting to the mostly arid Iran.

It is a major trade center between [[Caucasus|Caucasia]], [[Russia]], and Iran, using the port of [[Bandar-e Anzali]]. Rasht is also a major tourist center with the resort of [[Masouleh]] in the adjacent mountains and the beaches of Caspian as some of the major attractions.

Historically, Rasht was a major transport and business center which connected Iran to Russia and the rest of Europe, and because of this was known as the "Gate of Europe". The city has a history that goes back to the 13th century but its modern history dates back to the [[Safavid]] era during which Rasht was a major silk trade center with numerous textile workshops. In 2015, this city joined the network of creative cities of the world as a creative [[gastronomy]] city under the supervision of [[UNESCO]].

Some of the famous neighbourhoods of Rasht include Golsar, Safsar, Kordmahaleh and Khamiran.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gilan-today.com/7529 | title=- نام ها و مؤقعیت محلات قدیم و جدید در رشت }}</ref>

==Etymology==
There are multiple views about the city's name:<ref name="rasht name">{{cite web |title="Rasht", a name with 900 years of root in Abgd words |url=https://www.8deynews.com?p=96911 |website=www.8deynews.com |publisher=8daynews |access-date=3 April 2024 |language=Persian |date=1 November 2015}}</ref><ref name="isna name">{{cite news |title=Where has the name "Rasht" come from? |url=https://www.isna.ir/news/97120703825/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%DA%A9%D8%AC%D8%A7-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA |access-date=3 April 2024 |agency=ISNA |publisher=Iranian students news agency |date=27 February 2019 |language=Persian |quote=news code:97120703825}}</ref>
<ol>
<li>The root of the city's name is the word ''resh'' (رش) meaning ''very light rain''. The word ''varesh'' (وارش) meaning "rain" in [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], indicates that this word is a combination of ''va'' + ''resh'' (وا + رش).</li>
<li>Another point of view is that the correct pronunciation of the city's name is ''Resht'' (رِشت), taken from the root ''risidan'' (ریسیدن) or ''reshtan'' (رشتن), both meaning ''spin'',<ref name="abadis">{{cite web |title=Risidan - definition and meaning in Abadis dictionery |url=https://abadis.ir/fatofa/%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AF%D9%86/ |website=abadis.ir |publisher=Abadis |access-date=3 April 2024}}</ref> and the reason for this name is the importance of the city in the production of [[silk]] threads.</li>

==History==
[[File:Dana Ali in Rasht.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Dana-ye Ali, a famous resident of a village in Rasht]]{{Main|History of Gilan|Gīlān Province#History}}
===Timeline===
*682: Rasht was first mentioned in [[Umayyad]] historical documents.
*1669: [[Stenka Razin]], a [[Cossack]] warlord, plundered the city.
*1714: Rasht destroyed by earthquake.
*1722–1732: [[Capture of Rasht|Occupation]] by the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] due to the [[Russo-Persian War, 1722-1723|Russo-Persian War]].
*1901: A major epidemic plague devastates the city.
*1917–1920: The Russian and British armed forces fight in the port city of [[Bandar-e Anzali]] and Rasht. The British retreat and the Russians occupy the area.
*1920–1921: The short-lived [[Persian Socialist Soviet Republic|Gilan Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established with its capital in Rasht.
*1937: A revolt, sparked by the desire to collect a "road tax" from the Russians, was suppressed.
*1974: First university established in Rasht.

Rasht was first mentioned in [[Umayyad]] historical documents in 682 CE, but it is certainly older than this and appears on the [[Peutinger Map]]{{dubious|reason=Rasht does not literally appear on Peutinger map – see the upper part of Segmentum XI, 5 to Segmentum XII, 2, showing the Caspian Sea and its surroundings. Some claim that "Cyropolis (admare Caspium)", which appears in the notes below the map with a question mark, is Rasht, but that's just a tenuous claim at this point.|date=November 2024}} of [[late antiquity]]. It has seen the [[Sassanid]] era, the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] conquest, the armies of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and later [[list of Russian rulers|Russian rulers]], and [[British Persia|British colonialism]]. The people of Rasht also played a major role in the [[Constitutional Revolution of Iran]].

Rasht has, along with regions around Tabriz and Tehran, one of the earliest industry plants during the last quarter of the 19th century, prominently in fields such as fishing, caviar production, the Caspian sea oil pipeline construction and textiles. During the 20th century, until the mid-70s, Gilan and the Rasht region was the third-ranking industrial city in Iran by number of workers and per capital productivity. It lost its cultural and industrial status to a large extent after the 1970s.

The people of Rasht played a prominent role in instigation and radicalization of the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] (1905–1907). Rasht is the birthplace of [[Mīrzā Kūchak Khān]], one of the leading figures of the Constitutional Revolution. His own movement in [[Gilan]], which went by the name of [[Jangalihã|Jangalis]], represented a pro-modern and social democratic program for reformation of Muslim rituals and traditions. Mirza established the short-lived [[Persian Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1920 after the defeat of the constitutional forces and in coalition with Iranian communists.

The republic had the support of the newly established Russian Red Army. The Soviet Government, after a turn of military and political strategy proposed by Trotsky, withdrew its support and the republic itself was tormented by the inner conflicts between the newly established [[Iranian Communist Party]] (1919) and the Jangalis and other factions. The republic was finally defeated by the Iranian army under the command of Reza Shah.

The first national library of Iran was established in Rasht under the [[Qajar dynasty]]. ''[[Nasim-e-Shomal]]'', the first{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} modern newspaper of Iran after the constitutional revolution, has been initially published in Rasht. First Public Library of Iran was built in Rasht City.<small>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090124144356/http://nlai.ir/Default.aspx?tabid=466]</small> First Branch of the First Iranian Bank (Sepah Bank) was located in Rasht City.<ref>[http://www.banksepah.ir/default.aspx?tabid=160] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111062556/https://www.banksepah.ir/default.aspx?tabid=160|date=2021-01-11}}</ref> First branch of 24/7 pharmacy (Karoon pharmacy) was built in Rasht City. First school for girls and first fire station in Iran were also built in Rasht City. The city of Rasht was the center of Gilan and the center of the first province of the country.

During the [[Qajar]] period, along with economic development between Iran and Russia, Noghan trade and other products expanded. Thus, Rasht became the gateway to [[Europe]] in the 19th century. {{ill|Grigoriy Melgunov|ru|Мельгунов, Григорий Валерианович}}, a Russian orientalist and writer who visited Rasht at the end of 1860, wrote in his published notes that the city at that time had 5463 houses, 1021 shops, 22 mosques, 34 schools and 17 bathhouses, and a population of 27,314.<ref>{{cite book |last=Melgunov |first=Grigoriy |date=1863 |script-title=ru:О южном береге Каспийского моря |trans-title=On the south coast of the Caspian Sea |url=http://elib.shpl.ru/ru/nodes/71217-melgunov-g-v-o-yuzhnom-berege-kaspiyskogo-morya-spb-1863 |pages=220–221 |language=ru |location=Saint Petersburg |publisher=Printing Office of the Imperial Academy of Sciences}}</ref> At that time, Rasht's political credibility was such that the [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] governments had consulates in Rasht.<ref>The Adventures of a Frenchman in Rasht / Jean-Baptiste Nicola</ref>

===Modern day===
Rasht is turning into an industrialized town like most of the Iranian large cities and province capitals. Enjoying the Kadus International Hotel and hundreds of tourist attractions, Rasht receives thousands of foreign tourists annually, mostly from [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]] and [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] countries like [[Senegal]] and [[Cameroon]] as well as countries from [[Oceania]] like [[Micronesia]].

Rasht is known for its famous municipal building, located in the Square of Municipality, which was constructed circa 1900, and has been renovated each year. Due to the high amount of humidity in Rasht which damages and destroys the aged buildings, the native, older architectural texture of Rasht is gradually being replaced with the modern skyscrapers and apartments.

The culture of [[consumerism]] is prevalent among the people of Rasht as a cultural and urban center which is historically engaged in close commercial and political ties with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]] and [[France]]. Due to this background which makes the inhabitants much familiar with the industrial, cultural and political developments of the west, the finance and credit institutions are more willing to open representative offices and bureaus in Rasht and it has made the city a center of various banks and financial organizations.

There are many commercial centers, malls and financial institutions in Rasht including one branch of the Exports Development Bank of Iran which is an international bank dealing with the Iranian exports. The organizers and directors of national Iranian or non-Iranian banks afford to spend considerable amounts of budgets to construct attractive and modern buildings for their offices in Rasht.

Since the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 in Iran, there have always been requests on behalf of Russian, [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Azerbaijanis|Azeri]] banks to open branches in Rasht and that is why the city is endowed as the "gate of Europe" in Iran. The head consulate of the [[Russian Federation]] government is located in Rasht and some of the other [[Caspian region]] countries are also keen to establish representative headquarters in Rasht alongside their embassies in [[Tehran]].

Some evidences are the [[University of Gilan]] which was constructed jointly by the governments of [[Iran]] and [[West Germany]] about 40 years ago, the building of [[IRIB]] representatives in Rasht which was constructed jointly by the Iranian and [[Belgium|Belgian]] engineers.

===Taxi===
In 1947, 50 taxis were purchased from England by the order of [[Fakhr-ol-dowleh]] (daughter of Muzaffar al-Din Shah) and imported to Iran. In 1948, the first taxi entered Rasht by crossing the main street of the city due to his interest in Gilan. Rasht Metropolitan Taxi Organization has so far organized more than 9,500 taxis and private cars.

===Railway===
Rasht is served by Rasht railway station, which is located south of the city near the road to [[Jirdeh, Shaft]].<ref name="Rasht railway">[https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright OpenStreetMap Contributions]{{cite web |title=Rasht railway station |url=https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/37.2031/49.5642&layers=N |publisher=OpenStreetMap |access-date=16 May 2024 |language=Persian}}</ref>
