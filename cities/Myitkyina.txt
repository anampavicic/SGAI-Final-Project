In [[Burmese language|Burmese]] it means "near the big river", and Myitkyina is on the west bank of the [[Ayeyarwady River]], just below {{convert|40|km|mi|sp=us}} from Myit-son (Burmese for [[confluence]]) of its two headstreams (the [[Mali River|Mali]] and [[N'Mai River|N'mai]] rivers).<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/400392/Myitkyina |title=Myitkyina, Myanmar|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online|access-date=2009-03-29}}</ref> It is the northernmost river [[port]] and [[railway]] terminus in Myanmar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seat61.com/Burma.htm#Mandalay%20-%20Myityina|title=Train travel in Myanmar (Burma)|website=seat61.com|access-date=2009-03-29}}</ref> The city is served by [[Myitkyina Airport]].

==History==
Myitkyina has been an important trading town between China and Myanmar since ancient times.

American Baptist missionary [[George J. Geis]] and his wife arrived in Myitkyina in the late 1890s and in 1900 they requested permission to build a mansion in the town. The building was named [[Geis Memorial Church]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAMPAAAAIAAJ&q=George+J.+Geis|title=Baptist missionary magazine, Volume 80|publisher=[[American Baptist Foreign Mission Society]], [[American Baptist Missionary Union]]|page=196|year=1900}}</ref> It is one of the [[Kachin Baptist Convention]] (KBC) churches in Myitkyina.

Japanese forces captured the town and nearby airbase during [[World War II]] in 1942. In August 1944, Myitkyina was recaptured by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] under General [[Joseph Stilwell]] after a prolonged [[Siege of Myitkyina|siege]] and heavy fighting between [[Nationalist Chinese]] divisions, the [[Chindits]], and [[Merrill's Marauders]] of the [[Northern Combat Area Command]] and the besieged elements of the 33rd [[Imperial Japanese Army]] under General [[Masaki Honda]]. The town was strategically important not only because of its rail and water links to the rest of Burma, but also because it was on the planned route of the [[Ledo Road]].<ref name=EB/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gardnerworld.com/cbi/myitkyina.htm|last=Gardner|first=Major John J|title=Battle of Myitkyina|access-date=2006-10-15}}</ref>

==Climate==
Myitkyina has a borderline [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') bordering upon both a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') and a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''). Temperatures are very warm throughout the year, although the winter months from December to February are milder. There is a winter dry season from November to April and a summer wet season from May to October.

===Air quality===
The city residents dispose of the majority of their waste by burning it in small piles by the roadside. Most waste is disposed in this way, including plastics. Almost every block in the city has one small fire every evening. Burning usually starts late-afternoon, and by 6.00pm the city air is often quite smoky. Burning can start earlier at the weekend. The air quality in Myitkyina in the evenings can be poor, which can make being outside unpleasant. Sometimes, due to atmospheric pressure, the air will still be smoky in the morning. The only time of year that this does not happen is during the monsoon season, when it is reported that the air is fresh.

==Population==
[[File:Kachinstateparliament.jpg|thumb|The Kachin State Parliament building in Myitkyina]]

As the capital of the state, it has government offices, and a greater population than other cities in the state. The city has a population of approximately 150,000, with a mix of [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Bamar people|Bamar]], [[Burmese Gorkha]] and some [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Burmese Indians|Indians]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.my-myitkyina.com/mh_html/mka.htm|title=MYITKYINA|website=my-myitkyina.com|access-date=2006-08-24}}</ref>

The [[Jingpho language|Kachin language]] is the common language among the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]]. Some people can speak English and [[Nepali language|Nepali]] while the town's people mostly speak in Burmese which is the national language of Myanmar.

== Economy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}
Myitkyina is the business center of Kachin State, with many natural resources like [[jade]], [[gold]], [[amber]] and [[teak]], as well as [[wood]] and agricultural products. As per government data, almost US$2 billion in jade were exported yearly in 2010 and 2011. Now, due to fighting between [[Kachin Independence Army]] rebels and the government, most businesses in the region have gone down.

==Transportation==
[[File:Train_Station,_Myitkyina.jpg|thumb|[[Myitkyina railway station]]]]
[[Myitkyina Airport]] is the main airport serving the city. It connects the cities of [[Putao Town, Kachin State|Putao]], [[Mandalay]], Yangon and also [[Lashio]] on Mondays.

It takes almost 24 hours to travel between Mandalay and Myitkyina by train. [[Mandalay–Myitkyina Railway]] has been used for 100 years. This railway is a major means of transportation for both farmers and traders to deliver goods (before 2021 military coup). It also connects [[Laiza]], [[Bhamo]], [[China]], and [[Sumprabum]] by car and can go to Mandalay, Yangon, Lashio, and Magwe By Bus Station.

The Myitkyina-Tanai-[[India]] road, also known as the [[Ledo Road]], was constructed by the British.
