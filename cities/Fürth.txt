'''Fürth''' ({{IPA|de|fʏʁt|lang|De-Fürth2.ogg}}; [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]]: {{lang|vmf|Färdd}}; {{lang-yi|פיורדא|Fiurda}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] in northern [[Bavaria]], Germany, in the administrative division (''[[Regierungsbezirk]]''{{efn|literally "government district"}}) of [[Middle Franconia]].

It is the [[Franconia#Towns and cities|second-largest]] city in [[Franconia]] and now contiguous with the larger city of [[Nuremberg]], the centres of the two cities being only {{cvt|7|km|spell=in}} apart.

The city forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of Nuremberg, [[Erlangen]] and [[Schwabach]], which is the heart of an urban area region with around 1.4&nbsp;million inhabitants,<ref>[https://hey.bayern/region/nuernberg Region Nürnberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220704125051/https://hey.bayern/region/nuernberg |date=4 July 2022 }} on hey.bayern</ref> while the larger [[Nuremberg Metropolitan Region]] has a population of approximately 3.6 million.

Fürth celebrated its thousand-year anniversary in 2007, its first mention being on 1 November 1007.

== Geography ==
[[File:Fuerth Rathaus.jpg|thumb|City Hall, seen from the Schwabacher Straße]]
The historic centre of the town is to the east and south of the rivers [[Rednitz]] and [[Pegnitz River|Pegnitz]], which join to form the [[Regnitz]] to the northwest of the Old Town. To the west of the town, on the far side of the [[Main-Danube Canal]], is the Fürth municipal forest (''Fürther Stadtwald''). To the east of Fürth, at roughly the same latitude, lies Nuremberg, and to the north is the fertile market-gardening area known as the ''Knoblauchsland'' (garlic country), some of which is within the borders of the urban district of Fürth. To the south of the town is an area consisting of wide roads, the canal, and meadows.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
The following towns and municipalities share borders with Fürth; they are listed in clockwise order, starting in the north:

[[Erlangen]] and [[Nuremberg]], which are independent urban districts; [[Stein, Bavaria|Stein]], [[Oberasbach]], [[Zirndorf]], [[Cadolzburg]], Seukendorf, Veitsbronn, and Obermichelbach, which are municipalities within the rural district (''Landkreis'') of Fürth.

== History ==
[[File:Stadt Fürth 1903.jpg|thumb|Bond of the City of Fürth, issued 30 December 1903]]
Founded as a Franconian settlement in the mid-8th century AD,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Furth | title=Fürth &#124; Germany &#124; Britannica }}</ref> the first historical mention of Fürth was in a document dated 1 November 1007, in which the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich II]] donated his property in Fürth to the newly created Bishopric of [[Bamberg]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.1000-jahre-fuerth.de/DesktopDefault.aspx/tabid-213/ |title=1000 Jahre Fürth - Stadtgeschichte |access-date=2007-02-05 |archive-date=2016-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012035535/http://www.1000-jahre-fuerth.de/DesktopDefault.aspx/tabid-213/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The name "Fürth" derives from the German word for "ford", as the first settlements originated around a ford. In the following years, Fürth was granted [[Market town|market privileges]], but these were later lost to the neighbouring Nuremberg, under [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich III]]. From 1062 onward, Fürth was again permitted to have a market, but by that time Nuremberg was already the more important town.

In the following centuries, the town was under varying authority, involving the [[Archdiocese of Bamberg|Bishopric of Bamberg]], the [[Principality of Ansbach]] and [[Free Imperial City of Nuremberg|the City of Nuremberg]]. For a long time, the character of the settlement remained largely agricultural, and in 1600 the population was probably still only between 1000 and 2000.

In the [[Thirty Years War]], the village was almost completely destroyed by fire, in military actions leading up to the September 1632 [[Battle of Fürth]].

In 1835, the [[Bayerische Ludwigsbahn|first German railway]] was opened between Nuremberg and Fürth.

Throughout the Cold War, Fürth had a significant [[NATO]] presence, especially the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], due to its proximity to both the [[East Germany|East German]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] borders.

=== Expansion ===
In the course of time, a number of municipalities or other administrative divisions were integrated into the urban district of Fürth:

* 1 January 1899: the western part of the municipality of Höfen, including Weikershof (to the south of the Schwabacher Straße) <!-- http://www.altstadtverein-fuerth.de/weiker00.htm -->
* 1 January 1900: the municipality of Poppenreuth (to the east of the historic centre of the city, on the far side of the river Pegnitz)
* 1 January 1901: the municipality of Dambach (to the west of the current Südstadt (South Town), as well as Unterfürberg and Oberfürberg
* 1 January 1918: Atzenhof (to the north-west, on the right bank of the River Zenn between Unterfarrnbach and Vach)
* 1 January 1918: the municipality of Unterfarrnbach (to the west, on the bank of the river Farrnbach)
* 3 December 1923: the municipality of Burgfarrnbach (to the north-west, on the far side of the canal, not contiguous with Fürth proper)
* 1 July 1927: the municipality of Ronhof, and Kronach<ref name=Ohm2>{{cite book  | last = Ohm	  | first = Barbara  | title = Fürth: Geschichte der Stadt  | year = 2007  | publisher = Jungkunz  | language = de  | isbn = 978-3-9808686-1-7  | pages = 290 }}

=== Population development ===
[[File:Population Statistics Fürth.png|thumb|300px|Population trend]]

In the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], the population of Fürth grew slowly, owing to the numerous wars, epidemics and famines. In the [[Thirty Years War]], the town lost about half its population. When Croatian soldiers set fire to Fürth in 1634, it burned for several days, and was almost completely destroyed. At the end of the war, the population was a mere 800. In 1685, [[Reformed Church of France|Reformed Christians from France]], or [[Huguenots]], settled in Fürth. By 1700 the restoration of the town had been completed, and the population rose to about 6000.

With the beginning of [[industrialization]] in the 19th century, the population began to increase rapidly. In 1800 Fürth had a population of 12,000; by 1895 it had multiplied fourfold to 47,000. In 1950 the population of the town exceeded 100,000, making it a ''Großstadt''. At the end of 2005, as recorded by the Bavarian Statistical Office (''Landesamt für Statistik und Datenverarbeitung''), the population (based on principal residence) was 113,076, a historical record. This makes Fürth the second largest town in Middle Franconia, after Nuremberg, and the seventh largest town in Bavaria. As of 2015, the proportion of foreign nationals in Fürth is about 18 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dokumente.nuernberg.de/statistik/Thematische_Karten/innergeb_strukturdaten/2016/fue/is2016_fue_karte02.pdf |title=Stadtforschung und Statistik für Nürnberg und Fürth - Stadt Fürth, Ausländeranteil 2015 |publisher=nuernberg.de |access-date=2017-05-27}}</ref>

The following table shows the population of Fürth over time. Up to 1818 the figures are mainly estimates; after that they are mostly based on [[census]] results (¹) or official projections from the appropriate statistical offices or the town administration itself.

== Religions ==
[[File:Fürth St Michael from SE.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Michael, Fürth|St. Michael]], with West Tower]]

=== Christianity ===
The population of Fürth was originally under the [[Bishopric of Würzburg]] and from 1007 it belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Bamberg|Bishopric of Bamberg]]. In 1524, as part of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], it became a [[Protestant]] town like Nuremberg, and it remained so for many years. However, because of the connections with Bamberg, there were always some [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in the town.

After 1792, the Protestant congregations in Fürth were under the authority of the Prussian [[Ansbach]] [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Consistory]], and when [[Brandenburg-Ansbach]] was ceded to Bavaria they became part of the Bavarian Protestant Church, which initially comprised Lutheran and Reformed congregations. The congregations later belonged to the Deanery of Zirndorf. In 1885, Fürth became a deanery (''Dekanat''), subsidiary to Nuremberg.

Beside the Bavarian Protestant Church there are also Protestant congregations of free churches in Fürth, e. g. a small congregation of the [[United Methodist Church]].

From the 18th century or earlier, the number of [[Catholics]] rose, and in 1829 the first Catholic church since the Reformation was consecrated: the Church of Our Lady.  [[St. Michael, Fürth|St. Michael]] was originally a Catholic church until taken by the Protestants during the Reformation. In 1961, Fürth became a Catholic Deanery within the Archdiocese.

The proportion of Protestants to Catholics in the 20th century was about two to one.

=== Judaism ===
The position enjoyed by Jews in Fürth (compared with other towns) led to the sobriquet "Franconian Jerusalem", though this is based on an older, pejoratively intended reference to Fürth.

[[Judaism|Jewish]] residents are mentioned as early as 1440; in 1528 the [[Principality of Ansbach|Margrave of Ansbach]], [[George the Pious]], permitted two Jews, Perman and Uriel, to settle in Fürth (in return for high taxes), and from then on the number of Jewish residents increased.

By the 17th century, there was a local [[Yeshiva]] (Talmudic academy) of considerable repute, and in 1617, a [[synagogue]] was built. In 1653, the first Jewish hospital in Germany (and Fürth's first hospital) was built.

When Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] deported the Viennese Jews in 1670, many upper-class Jewish families moved to Fürth, and by 1716 there were about 400 Jewish families in the town. In 1807, the proportion of Jews in the overall population was about 19%. Following the [[German mediatisation|Mediatization]] and the Bavarian ''[[Judenedikt]]'' (Jewish Edict) of 1813,<ref>Edikt die Verhältnisse der jüdischen Glaubensgenossen im Königreiche Baiern betreffend vom 10. Juni 1813</ref> there were more restrictions on Jews. In particular, the ''Matrikelparagraph'' provisions prevented Jewish immigration. In 1824, the Talmudic academy was closed. The Bavarian ''Judenedikt'' of 1813, with its restrictions on Jewish life and Jewish immigration was rescinded by the law of 29 June 1851, and further laws dated 16 April 1868, and 22 April 1871, which led to further emancipation of the Jews, and restrictions on residence were removed.<ref>{{cite journal

</ref> By 1840, there were 2,535 Jews living in Fürth, more than half of all Bavarian Jews.

In 1862, a Jewish primary school was founded, followed by a secondary school in 1882. The highest number of Jewish residents was reached in 1880, at about 3,300.

In 1933, there were 1,990 Jews in Fürth.<ref>Chronik Fürth 1933 – 1945 Der Israelitische. http://www.juedische-fuerther.de/images/pdf/chronik.pdf</ref><ref name="Fürther Shoah-Opfer 1997. p. 13">Komitee zum Gedenken der Fürther Shoah-Opfer (Bearbeitung Gisela Naomi Blume): Memorbuch zum Gedenken an die von den Nazis Ermordeten Fürther Juden. Fürth 1997. p. 13.</ref> By early 1938 after the rise of the Nazis, there were 1,400 Jews in Fürth. In November 1938, there were about 1,200 when the synagogue was destroyed in the [[Reichskristallnacht|Kristallnacht]] pogroms, and 132 Jews were deported to Dachau. All except a handful of those who remained in Fürth after Kristallnacht either fled while they still could (abroad or to other areas in Germany) or were deported to concentration camps and/or death camps; virtually all those who remained in Germany were deported to their deaths. By 1944, perhaps 23 Jews were left in Furth. Overall, 1,068 Jews from Furth were murdered in the Holocaust.<ref name="Fürther Shoah-Opfer 1997. p. 13"/><ref>Fürther Nachrichten vom 3. Juni 2009, p. 1: Denkmal erweitert.</ref>

After the end of the [[Second World War]], a [[Displaced persons camp]] for Jewish Holocaust survivors was established in Fürth (Finkenschlag). In 1945 it housed 850 inhabitants; it was shut down in July 1950.

There is a memorial to the Jewish community in the Geleitsgasse square, just off Königstrasse. Archaeologists discovered a [[Mikvah]] (ritual bath) in a house in the centre of Fürth. This building now houses the Jewish Museum of Franconia, which opened in 1998.

The old Jewish cemetery (Weiherstraße), which was established in 1607, is one of the oldest in Germany. It suffered considerable destruction and desecration during the Nazi regime and the Second World War, but was restored in 1949 and is now one of the best-preserved Jewish cemeteries in Germany. A new Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1880, which has been in use from 1906 to the present day.
<!-- ====Islam====-->

== Nature ==
The "Nature Trail for Urban Ecology"  was established in 1999 ({{cvt|3|km}}, 10 stops) and expanded in 2003 to include a second route ({{cvt|7|km}}, 10 stops). Both tours begin at the [[Stadthalle (Nuremberg U-Bahn)|Stadthalle underground railway station]]. Along the nature trail, different habitats and their importance for the flora and fauna of the area are explained (e.g. the churchyard of St. Michael's Church, the municipal cemetery, Scherbsgraben stream). The trail references the designation of some areas as [[protected area]]s, and explains problems of measures that affect the environment, such as river regulation.

Average sunshine duration is 1766 hours per year.

The Gustav-Adolf natural spring, near Weikershof, by the River Rednitz was restored in 2000 and a pavilion was erected. Until the 1980s, the spring water, which comes out of the ground at {{cvt|19|°C}}, was used for a swimming pool.

== Politics ==

=== Coat of arms ===
The Fürth [[coat of arms]] depicts a green [[trefoil]] (three-leaved [[clover]]) on a white (argent) background. The town colours are green and white. The trefoil first appeared on a seal of the governor of the city for the Bamberg Diocese, which depicted a trefoil held by a hand and between two crescents. Its origin is unclear, but the trefoil probably represents the three powers responsible for Fürth during the [[Middle Ages]] as well as being a symbol of the Trinity. From 1792 onward, there were three trefoils on a triple hill. In 1818, the town acquired a new coat of arms depicting a green trefoil surrounded by an oak branch (acorned). This coat of arms was retained for over 100 years. However, in 1939, the oak branch was removed. At that time, a new flag was introduced; it had two green stripes on a green background and the coat of arms on a green background on the upper part. Later, however, the flag was simplified to the colours white (below) and green (above).

=== Administration ===
Until the end of the 18th century, the administration of Fürth was in the hands of a representative of the Diocese of Bamberg. Fürth was transferred to Bavaria in 1806; in 1808 it was made a "class II" city<ref name="Fürth_de_Hist">[http://www.fuerth.de/DesktopDefault.aspx/tabid-95/146_read-819/ Official Fürth Website: Historical data and facts]</ref>  and was under the direct authority of the state. From 1818 Fürth became a "class I" city;<ref name="Fürth_de_Hist"/> this meant that it was responsible for its own administration.

Since 2002 Thomas Jung, ([[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]]), has been the First Mayor.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
[[File:Atzenhof muellberg.jpg|thumb|300px|Solar power collection on former landfill at Atzenhof]]
As of July 2019, [[unemployment]] in Fürth was 2.9 percent.

The toy industry is a major employer in the Fürth economy, with a variety of toy-makers ranging from small crafts to large industrial enterprises.

Brewing was once important in Fürth. The five large breweries were Humbser, Geismann, Grüner, Evora & Meyer, and Berg Bräu. Around the turn of the 19th century, Fürth was more important than Munich as a "beer town".

[[KarstadtQuelle|Quelle]], once the largest mail-order company in Europe, was based in Fürth before its insolvency and liquidation in 2009.

Fürth is also a centre of [[solar energy|solar]] technology. An average of two megawatt of electricity are fed into the grid on sunny days by Infra Fürth, the local energy utility, using [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology. A ground-based plant in Atzenhof located on a former landfill produces 1 MW, the largest individual share. {{citation needed| date=July 2018}}

A new pumping station was built in 2003 near the confluence of the Pegnitz and Rednitz rivers. It provides artificial irrigation to the ''Knoblauchsland'' market garden area to the north-east of the city.

=== Transport ===

==== Airports ====
[[File:Europeisk lufttrafik 1924, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|thumb|Map of European air traffic 1924 from the Nordisk familjebok encyclopedia.]]
In 1914, an aerodrome was built at [[Atzenhof]] for the Third Bavarian Army Corps, which was extended in the following years. After the [[First World War]], it became "Fürth–Nuremberg" international airport, which saved it from being completely dismantled. Fürth-Nuremberg Airport was the eighth largest of the 88 German airports. The importance of the airport increased further when [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] transferred first its central repair workshop, and then the final assembly line for its aircraft from Dessau to Fürth. Under the [[National Socialism|Nazis]], the airport at Atzenhof was expanded and used as a flying school. After Fürth was occupied by Allied troops, the  [[United States Army|US Army]] used the site as a barracks, until 1993 (Monteith Barracks Army Heliport).

[[File:Fuerth Stadttheater 2.jpg|thumb|Stadttheater Fürth]]

=== Theatre ===
The municipal theatre (''Stadttheater Fürth'') was built by the Viennese theatre architects Fellner & Helmer in the Italian Renaissance and Baroque styles. It is very similar to the municipal theatre of the Ukrainian town of [[Chernivtsi]], which was designed by the same architects.

Another playhouse, the Comödie Fürth, is now housed in the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] building known as the ''Berolzheimerianum''. Regular appearances are made by the Franconian cult comedians Volker Heißmann and Martin Rassau, better known by their ''alter ego''s Waltraud and Mariechen. The playhouse hosts other appearances by German stars of comedy theatre.

== Sights ==

=== Monuments ===
[[File:Fuerth gauklerbrunnen v so.jpg|thumb|300px|Gauklerbrunnen at the "Grüner Markt", 2004]]

Fürth survived the Second World War with less damage than most German cities, and many historic buildings remain. Fürth has a very high density of historic buildings and monuments per head of population (17 per 1000 inhabitants).

The city centre is typified by the streets with intact architecture from the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the old town, around the Church of St. Michael, there are ensembles of buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries. Of particular note is the Hornschuch Promenade with ''[[Gründerzeit]]'' and ''[[Jugendstil]]'' apartment houses. The ''Südstadt'', the southern part of the town, also has many historic buildings, but these tend to be former workers' tenements, so the house fronts are less grand. A lot of frame and freestones houses from 17.–19. century can be found in quarters and suburbs, f.e. Poppenreuth, Burgfarrnbach, Vach and Dambach.

The Rathaus, built in the Italian style by [[Friedrich Bürklein]] between 1840 and 1850, is modelled on the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]].

=== Museums ===
* The Jewish Museum in Franconia' (Königstraße 89), which also has a branch in [[Schnaittach]], was opened in 1999. The main part of the house goes back to the 17th century; Jewish families lived here until the late 19th century. The stucco ceilings, a historic [[Sukkah]] and a [[Mikvah]] in the basement have remained intact. The museum is also meant to be a meeting place, and has a bookshop and a cafeteria.
* ''Fürth Radio museum'' (Kurgartenstraße 37)
* ''Stadtmuseum'' (Municipal/Town Museum), (Ottostr.2) at former Otto schoolhouse shows a lot of town history  in a permanent exhibition and alternating special exhibitions
* The ''kunst galerie fürth'' (Königsplatz 1), which was opened at the end of 2002, is a place for modern art, with varying exhibitions.
* The Jakob-Henle-Haus houses a collection of dialysis technology.

=== Churches ===
The  [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestant]] Church of St. Michael is the oldest building in Fürth. Its beginnings go back to around 1100, the 45-metre (150&nbsp; ft) tower was added around 1400 at the beginning of the Late Gothic period, and most of the building work was carried out in the 15th century. The interior of the church is mainly Neo-Gothic in character, with most of the Late Gothic ornaments having been replaced in the 19th century. The only remaining late Gothic ornament is the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] on the North wall; it is 6.8&nbsp;metres (22&nbsp;ft&nbsp;4 in) high and was probably created around 1500–1510 by artists near to [[Adam Kraft]]. It is the church's most valuable work of art.
Other churches with gothic parts from 14.–16. century are St.Johannis in Burgfarrnbach, St.Peter and Paul in Poppenreuth and St.Matthäus in Vach. St. Peter and Paul probably has some older parts, the previous building was probably founded around 900 – 1000 and was mother Church of many other churches f.e. St.Sebald in Nuremberg.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Church of Our Lady (1824–1828) is a Classical building, as is the Protestant "Church of the Resurrection" (1825–26), originally belonging to the cemetery and therefore aligned in a north–south direction. In the Südstadt area are the [[Neo-Gothic]] Church of St. Paul and the [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] Church of St. Henry and Kunigunde. Other churches include the Catholic Church of Christ the King (''Christkönig''), which was built in the 1970s.
