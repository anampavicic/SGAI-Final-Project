'''Dhahran''' ({{langx|ar|الظهران|translit=Ad͟h D͟hahrān}}) is a city located in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. With a total population of  143,936 as of 2022,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aẓ-Ẓahrān (Ad-Dammām, Eastern Region Region, Saudi Arabia) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/saudiarabia/eastern/ad_damm%C4%81m/05007__a%E1%BA%93_%E1%BA%93ahr%C4%81n/ |access-date=2024-02-05 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> it is a major administrative center for the [[History of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia|Saudi oil industry]]. Together with the nearby cities of [[Dammam]] and [[Al Khobar|Khobar]], Dhahran forms part of the [[Dammam Metropolitan Area]], which is commonly known as greater Dammam and has an estimated population of 2.2 million as of 2022.

A Concession Agreement to search for oil was signed in Jeddah on May 29, 1933, between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Standard Oil of California.  However, it was not until five years later, in 1938, that the first oil in commercial quantities was produced. Standard Oil later established a subsidiary in Saudi Arabia called [[Saudi Aramco|the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO)]], now owned by the [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi government]] and known as [[Saudi Aramco]]. Dhahran has been the home of Saudi Aramco's headquarters for 90 years and is its first and largest [[gated community|gated compound]]. Employees and dependents of Aramco, known as Aramcons, have a tendency to use Dhahran to solely refer to the [[Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran|Aramco Camp]] while using Khobar and/or Dammam to refer to the area outside the camp.

Dhahran is unusual in that a large portion of it is made up of gated areas including [[Saudi Aramco]]'s headquarters and [[Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran|residential camp]], the [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]] (built by Aramco) and the [[King Abdulaziz Air Base]]. Dhahran is also home to the Mall of Dhahran, one of the biggest shopping complexes in the Eastern Province.

== Geography ==
Dhahran is a short distance west of downtown [[Khobar]]. It is about {{convert|15|km|mi|sigfig=2}} south of [[Dammam]]. Both are older Saudi port cities on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]]. Looking farther afield, Dhahran is northeast of [[Abqaiq]], and southeast of [[Qatif]] and, further north, [[Ras Tanura]], a major oil port. The Kingdom of [[Bahrain]] is also within easy driving distance to the east (about 32&nbsp;km [20&nbsp;mi]), across the [[King Fahd Causeway]], from Khobar.

[[File:King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture (Ithra).png|thumb|[[King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture]] (Ithra) Building]]
There are several notable landmarks in Dhahran City including [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals|KFUPM]] clock tower as well as Saudi Aramco's Al-Midra Tower and [[King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture]]. However, the tallest building in Dhahran is Al-AbdelKareem Tower, where the neighboring Al-Othman twin towers come as second tallest, all located at Al-Qashlah district in the north east of the city facing Al-Khobar.

== Geology ==
The patch of desert on which the city is built is hilly and rocky, and most of the earliest productive oil wells in Saudi Arabia were drilled in the area, such as Dammam Well {{abbr|No.|number}}&nbsp;7: "Prosperity Well", the first commercially viable oil well in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. This well was still in production 70 years later.  This later led to the selection of two barren nearby hills as the place for [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] to construct its headquarters.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060321045545/http://www.aramco-brats.com/museum/DHmap1972.htm]

The Dhahran-Dammam area is one of two regions, the other being [[Jeddah]], that were selected as potential sites to build the first Saudi [[nuclear reactor]].

== Climate ==
Dhahran has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BWh''), featuring summers among the hottest and most humid in the world, and virtually frost-free winters. Temperatures can rise to more than {{convert|40|°C|°F|sigfig=3}} in the summer, coupled with high humidity, {{Citation needed|reason=high humidity levels usually occur at night and aren't really coupled to the high temperature|date=February 2013}} given the city's proximity to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The highest recorded temperature in Dhahran is {{convert|51.1|°C|°F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|title=Extreme Temperatures Around the World|access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref> In winter, the temperature rarely falls below {{convert|-2|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}, with the lowest ever recorded being {{convert|−5|°C|°F}} in January 1964.<ref name="NOAA"/> Rain falls almost exclusively between the months of November and May. The [[Shamal (wind)|Shamal]] winds usually blow across the city in the early months of the summer, bringing [[dust storms]] that can reduce [[visibility]] to a few metres. These winds can last for up to six months.

It was reported that on July 8, 2003, the [[dew point]] was {{convert|35|C|F}} while the temperature was {{convert|42|C|F}}, which would indicate a [[heat index]] of {{convert|79|C|F}}, one of the highest heat indexes ever reported.<ref>{{cite news |title= Washington, D.C. can feel hotter than Death Valley at its hottest |first= Jason |last= Samenow |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= July 3, 2013 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/07/03/washington-d-c-can-feel-hotter-than-death-valleys-hottest/ }}</ref>

==History==
Dhahran was settled after 1938, the year oil was discovered in the vicinity.<ref>Cohen, Saul B. ''The Columbia Gazetteer of the World'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1998) p. 828</ref> ARAMCO (then the Arabian American Oil Company, today's [[Saudi Aramco]]) built various residential areas, known as camps, to house the company's oil workers (and in some cases their families) in what was then a remote part of the desert.<ref>https://www.aramco.com/-/media/publications/books/energytotheworldvol1english.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}{{Dead link|date=May 2023}}</ref>

During [[World War II]] on 19 October 1940 Dhahran was struck by [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian Royal Air Force]] ([[Regia Aeronautica]]) as a part of [[Bombing of Bahrain in World War II|Bombing of Bahrain]], causing minimal damage.

In 1944, the United States was authorized to build an air base in Dhahran (officially referred to as Dhahran Airfield). Construction began in 1945 and was completed in 1946. The base was turned over to the Saudis when its lease expired in the early 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2001/10/why_us_military_bases_are_good_for_mecca_and_medina.html|title=Why U.S. Military Bases Are Good for Mecca and Medina|date=2001-10-15|work=Slate|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Dhahran is historically significant in the development of US-Saudi relations, starting with the discovery of oil that led to the creation of ARAMCO (the Arabian American Oil Company, today's [[Saudi Aramco]]), which in turn led to the US building the Dhahran Airfield (built adjacent to Aramco's residential camp) and the construction of the former US consulate (also adjacent to the Aramco camp).

In 1950 Dhahran had a population of about 7,000 people.<ref>Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952) p. 510</ref>

During the [[Gulf War]], the city was the scene of the largest loss of life among coalition forces. On February 25, 1991, an Iraqi [[Al Hussein (missile)|Al-Hussein missile]] hit a U.S. Army barracks in the city, killing 28 American reservists from Pennsylvania.<ref>From: [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3912/is_199905/ai_n8848881#prof ''Management of Casualties from the Scud attack on Dhahran'']</ref><ref>Higham, Nicholas J (1996).

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Saudi Arabia}}

The population of Dhahran is mainly Saudi, but also includes many [[expatriate]]s from Asian countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and the [[Philippines]], as well as countries such as the United States, Canada, [[European countries]], [[Turkey]], South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. There are also many non-Saudi Arab nationals living in Dhahran, such as [[Yemenis]], [[Egyptians]], [[Jordanians]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Palestinians]], [[Sudan]]ese, and [[Syrians]]. The 1993 population of the city was 73,691.<ref name=colen>{{cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2013|publisher=The Columbia University|edition=6th|isbn= |chapter=Dhahran}}{{ISBN?}}</ref> According to a 2004 census the total population of the Dhahran municipality is 97,446.

Many companies that employ relatively large numbers of expatriates have built fenced-in compounds where only expatriates live; however, the largest compound, the [[Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran]] provides accommodation to many different nationalities. Although built originally to house only expatriate oil company employees (mainly Americans) to provide a degree of Western comfort and separation from the restrictions of Saudi and Islamic laws, the community today has shifted somewhat in line with the reduction of western residents into a multi-ethnic mosaic of Saudis, other Arab nationalities (e.g., Egyptian and Jordanian), Asians, Europeans, South Americans, Africans and Australians.  While only employees of Saudi Aramco live on the camp, their nationalities reflect those of the company as a whole. There are also several neighborhoods, or suburbs just outside the main Saudi Aramco Camp, such as Doha District (حي الدوحه) Dana District (حي الدانة) and Aljamiah District (حي الجامعة), where Saudi Aramco gives home loans to Saudi employees to build their own homes.

Dhahran is unique in a way that majority of the population live inside gated communities, whether built by Saudi Aramco, KFUPM or military.

==Government, law, and security==
{{Main|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}

Dhahran is part of the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], the largest province in Saudi Arabia. The province is governed by Prince [[Saud bin Nayef|Saud bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]]. Just like the rest of the country, the law of [[Shari’a]], or [[Islamic]] law is adhered to. Following the [[Saudi Arabian municipal elections]] in 2005, members of the municipal councils were elected.

Dhahran is guarded as it is a high visibility city. The [[Saudi Special Emergency Forces]]' Eastern Province headquarters are located in Dhahran near the Saudi Aramco residential camp. There are many security checkpoints throughout the city that have been almost permanently in place since the [[Riyadh Compound Bombings]].

The first American consulate was opened in Dhahran in 1944.<ref>{{cite journal|author=I. Andrew|title=Ambassador Parker T. Hart (1910-1997)|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=28 February 1998|volume=XI|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-592486861/ambassador-parker-t-hart-1910-1997|access-date=|archive-date=10 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210233418/https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-592486861/ambassador-parker-t-hart-1910-1997|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:On the Dhahran-Al Khobar Highway.jpg|thumb|Road to the Saudi Aramco Dhahran main gate]]
As the centre of the nation's oil industry, Dhahran enjoys good transport resources both nationally and internationally, especially after the extensive modernisation of the nations highway infrastructure in the 1970s and 1980s.

===Road===
The extensive highway network in the Dhahran, Khobar, Dammam area serves the strategically important national oil industry, led by Saudi Aramco, as well as the local population. However, car ownership in the Kingdom has soared which often leaves non-highway roads congested at peak times.

===Airport===
Formerly one of Saudi Arabia's three major international airports, [[Dhahran International Airport|Dhahran Airport]] (DHA), which opened in 1946 as [[Dhahran Airfield]], is now a [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] airbase. Today, [[King Fahd International Airport]] (DMM), which replaced Dhahran International for commercial, private and [[air cargo|cargo]], serves the entire Metropolitan Area of Dhahran, Dammam, and Khobar, the distance to the airport terminal is about 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) from Dhahran. Saudi Aramco Aviation operates the general aviation terminal at [[King Fahd International Airport]] exclusively as its own terminal, where all Saudi Aramco flights originate.

===Railway===
Although rail service in Saudi Arabia plays a much more minor role today than 50 years ago, an industrial railroad with a station adjacent to Dhahran still exists, linking it to the capital [[Riyadh]].

===Public transport===
Public transport buses are only available in a very limited manner, with taxi services, at reasonable prices and widely available, proving more popular. Large companies such as Saudi Aramco run their own bus transport operations, connecting residential and industrial camps of the company with Dhahran, Dammam, and Khobar. Many smaller residential compounds also operate their own bus services which are typically used for transport to places of work or shopping trips by residents.

==Communications and media==
Mobile telephone communications are provided mainly by [[Saudi Telecom Company|STC]], [[Mobily]] and [[Zain Group|Zain]], which have launched 3G, 4G and 5G services to their customers.

STC also provides landlines through its Al-Hatif services, as well as providing internet services through Saudi Data.

There are several [[internet service provider]]s such as Al-Alamiah, ArabNet, Nesma and others. Both [[DSL]] and [[FTTH]] services are available.

There are several popular radio stations, such as [[Radio Sawa]], Studio One 91.4 FM, broadcast from Aramco, and Bahrain Radio 96.5 FM.

Satellite television is predominant in the market, with [[Orbit Showtime]] being the most popular, as well as the widespread variety of satellite channel operators including [[Eutelsat]], [[AsiaSat]], [[Palapa]], [[Arabsat]] and [[Nilesat]].

==Education==
Schools in Dhahran come under two sections: public (government-run) and private. Public schools (K-12), open to almost everyone, strictly adhere to teaching the curriculum exactly as provided by the Ministry of Education. Public schools also come under two sections: Saudi Aramco-built and government-built. The Saudi Aramco built schools are usually better in design and last longer due to their being built to higher standards; however, they are not operated by the company.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}} Private schools also teach the ministry's curriculum, but they have more flexibility often enhancing certain aspects, such as exceeding the ministry's curriculum when teaching the English language and computer applications. University Schools, located within King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, and Dhahran Ahliyyah Schools are examples of top private schools across Saudi Arabia are based in Dhahran.

There are several schools that teach the curriculum of their native countries, such as the Multinational School Dhahran (MNS Dhahran Multinational School Dhahran (MNS Dhahran), Dhahran British Grammar School, Dhahran Elementary Middle School, and Dhahran High School.

Dhahran High School (formerly Dhahran Academy High School) is a part of [[International Schools Group]] and is primarily composed of expatriates including American, British, Lebanese, Filipino, and Indian students. There have been Saudi students as well, though this is relatively rare. [[Advanced Placement]] courses have been available since Dhahran High School's first graduating class in 2001.

The [[Dhahran School]] and the Dhahran Hills School are Saudi Aramco-run American curriculum schools within the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp. These schools are strictly only for the children of expatriate Saudi Aramco employees but are provided completely free of charge to them. They are fully accredited and are part of the larger Saudi Aramco Schools district, encompassing all Saudi Aramco-operated schools within Aramco residential compounds.

Dhahran is also home to the world-renowned King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals ([[KFUPM]]),<ref name=colen/> and the Aramco Training Center (ATC), where many new employees of Saudi Aramco learn useful skills, such as English, business mathematics, physics, and computer skills. [[Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University]] and [[Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University]] are also located near and within the city respectively.

==Dhahran in popular culture==
* In 1998, after the kidnapping and murder of [[Matthew Shepard]], a [[gay men|gay]] college student from [[Wyoming]], major American news networks would occasionally mention that the student's parents lived in Dhahran and worked for Saudi Aramco.
* In [[Abdelrahman Munif]]'s ''Cities of Salt'' novels, the oil company outpost of Harran is widely believed to be Dhahran's fictional analogue.
* In the premise of ''[[Ghost Fleet (novel)|Ghost Fleet]]'', Dhahran is the victim of a terrorist attack which utilizes a [[dirty bomb]], which causes massive damage to the world oil economy and caused anarchy around the world, and it is the first event in a string of incidents that eventually lead to [[World War III]].
