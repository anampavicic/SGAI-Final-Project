'''Bắc Giang''' is a province of [[Vietnam]], located in the [[Northeast (Vietnam)|Northeast]] region of the country, and situated {{convert|50|km|mi}} to the east of [[Hanoi]]. The province covers {{Convert|3895.89|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},<ref name="area_2022"/> and, as of 2023, its population was 1,922,740 people.<ref name=census/>

The province lies in the [[Red River Delta]] and is bordered by [[Quảng Ninh Province|Quảng Ninh]] to the east, [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]] to the north, [[Thái Nguyên Province|Thái Nguyên]] and the urban district of Sóc Sơn in the capital [[Hanoi]] to the west, and [[Bắc Ninh Province|Bắc Ninh]] and [[Hải Dương Province|Hải Dương]] to the south.

==History==
[[File:Province de Bac-Giang (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bac Giang province in 1909]]
Bắc Giang's history is traced to the [[Hùng king]]s of the [[Hong Bang period]], when Vietnam was known as [[Văn Lang]]. Bắc Giang was in the division of Võ Ninh.

During the [[Lê dynasty]], the province was the prefecture of Bắc Hà. Following the ascent of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]], it became the prefecture of Thiên Phúc in 1822, before becoming the prefecture of [[Đa Phúc]] during the time of Emperor [[Tự Đức]]. From 5 November 1889 to 9 September 1891, there existed the province of [[Lục Nam District|Lục Nam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangthuphathoc.com/mevaquehuong/qhvn/13.htm|title=Bắc Giang|publisher=Tangthuphathoc|access-date=25 August 2010|language=vi}}</ref> It comprised the districts of Bảo Lộc, Phượng Nhỡn, Lục Nam, Hữu Lũng (split from Lạng Giang and Bắc Ninh Province) and the district of Yên Bái (split from Lạng Sơn Province). In 1891 after the return of the districts of Bảo Lộc and Phượng Nhỡn back to [[Bắc Ninh province]], Lục Nam was abolished and integrated into Đạo Quan Binh I.

The modern province of Bắc Giang was founded on 10 October 1895,<ref name=Diachi>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanhoabacgiang.vn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=212:gii-thiu-sach-a-chi-thanh-ph-bc-giang&catid=58:gioithieu-sachbacgiang&Itemid=91|title=Giới thiệu sách: Địa chí Thành phố Bắc Giang|publisher=Vanhoabacgiang|language=vi|access-date=25 August 2010|archive-date=17 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217153209/http://www.vanhoabacgiang.vn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=212:gii-thiu-sach-a-chi-thanh-ph-bc-giang&catid=58:gioithieu-sachbacgiang&Itemid=91|url-status=dead}}</ref> when it was created out of Bắc Ninh Province.<ref name=Diachi/> It initially comprised the prefectures of Lạng Giang and Đa Phúc and the districts of Kim Anh, [[Yên Dũng District|Yên Dũng]], [[Phượng Nhỡn]], Việt Yên, Hiệp Hòa, Yên Thế and some small territories south of Lục Nam River. The province capital was [[Phủ Lạng Thương]], which is now the city of [[Bắc Giang]]. In 1896, the prefecture of Đa Phúc and the [[Kim Anh District]] was returned to Bắc Ninh Province.

[[Japanese coup d'état in French Indochina|In March 1945]], Japanese troops conducted multiple massacres of French prisoners of war in Bắc Giang province. Immediately after the surrender of the Bắc Giang garrison, they bayoneted 45 prisoners of war to death; four badly wounded men survived. On 11 March 22 prisoners were killed on the banks of the [[Cầu River]]. Thirteen more were killed in a similar fashion two days later. On 14 March, 14 French prisoners were executed behind a church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anapi.asso.fr/en_Prisoners-of-the-Japanese_19.htm|title=The 9th March 1945 onslaught|publisher=Association Nationale des Anciens Prisonniers et Internés d'Indochine|access-date=7 June 2017|language=en|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201202546/http://www.anapi.asso.fr/en_Prisoners-of-the-Japanese_19.htm|archive-date=1 December 2006}}</ref>

In 1950, during the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], Bắc Giang was put into the Confederation of Northern Vietnam ({{lang-vi|Liên Khu Việt Bắc}}) by the communist [[Việt Minh]] and comprised seven districts: Hiệp Hoà, Lục Ngạn, Yên Thế, Lạng Giang, Việt Yên, Yên Dũng, [[Hữu Lũng District|Hữu Lũng]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Sách tra cứu các mục từ vè̂ tỏ̂ chức|author=Quang Thưởng Lê|publisher=Nhà xuá̂t bản Chính trị quó̂c gia|year=2004|language=vi}}</ref> On 22 February 1955, the [[Sơn Động District]] ([[Quảng Yên province]]) was incorporated into Bắc Giang Province. On 1 July 1956, upon the formation of the Autonomous Region of Northern Vietnam ({{lang-vi|Khu Tự Trị Việt Bắc}}), the Hữu Lũng District was transferred to Lạng Sơn Province. On 21 January 1957, the districts of Sơn Động and Lục Ngạn were divided into the three districts of Sơn Động, Lục Ngạn and Lục Nam. On 27 October 1962, Bắc Giang merged with Bắc Ninh into the new [[Hà Bắc province]], until it was re-partitioned on 1 January 1997 into its previous components.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The province's name was derived from the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] [[wikt:北|北]][[wikt:江|江]], meaning "north of the river".

==Geography==
Bắc Giang lies in the [[Red River Delta]]. It borders Quảng Ninh to the east, Lạng Sơn to the north, Thái Nguyên and the urban district of Sóc Sơn in the capital Hanoi to the west, and Bắc Ninh and Hải Dương to the south. It comprises three land forms namely, the lowland or delta land, the midland and the mountainous region. While the midland areas are in the districts of Hiệp Hoà and Việt Yên, and the city of Bắc Giang, the mountainous districts are the Sơn Động, Lục Ngạn, Yên Thế, Tân Yên, Yên Dũng and Lạng Giang; the seven mountainous districts account for 72% of the area of Bắc Giang province.<ref name=cycling>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indocycling.com/destination/view/28 |title=Bắc Giang province |access-date=29 August 2010 |publisher=Indo China Cycling |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230142139/http://www.indocycling.com/destination/view/28 |archive-date=December 30, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=Zones>{{Cite web|url=http://bacgiang-iza.gov.vn/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=123:natural-condition&catid=25:natural-condition&Itemid=89|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121201212049/http://bacgiang-iza.gov.vn/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=123:natural-condition&catid=25:natural-condition&Itemid=89|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 December 2012|title=Bắc Giang Province: Minerals|access-date=29 August 2010|publisher=Bắc Giang Industrial Zones Authority}}</ref>

Of the total land area of the province, {{convert|123000|ha|acre}} is agricultural land, {{convert|110000|ha|acre}} is forest land, {{convert|66500|ha|acre}} is residential and urban land and for other uses. The farmland in the province is good for [[intensive farming]] of rice, vegetable, and fruit crops, and bulb trees. There is scope for expanding land under forests. The produce from the forests has been estimated as 3.5 million m<sup>3</sup> of wood and 500 million trees of [[bamboo]] and [[neohouzeaua]].

Bắc Giang occupies an area of {{convert|3827.45|km2|mi2}},<ref name="VN Tours">{{cite web|url=http://www.vn-tours.com/guide/bac-giang-province.asp|title=Bắc Giang Province|publisher=VN Tours|access-date=25 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823073215/http://www.vn-tours.com/guide/bac-giang-province.asp|archive-date=2010-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> which is 1.2% of the area of the whole country.

It has railway lines from Bắc Giang to Hanoi, Lạng Sơn, Thái Nguyên, and mineral areas in Quảng Ninh by train.<ref name=cycling/>

The terrain is moderately mountainous, lying between the high mountains to the north and the [[Red River Delta]] to the south. Although a large part of the terrain is mountainous most of it is not isolated. The region to the northern end of the province is mountainous uncleared forest. To the east and southeast of the province is Đông Triều and [[Mount Yên Tử]], located within the [[Yên Tử Nature Reserve]]. The elevation of the province is mostly in the {{convert|300|-|900|m|ft}} range, with a maximum of {{convert|1068|m|ft}} (Mount Yên Tử).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://birdlifeindochina.org/birdlife/source_book/pdf/2%20north%20east/Yen%20Tu.pdf|title=Yen Tu Nature Reserve|publisher=Bird Life in Indo China|access-date=25 August 2010}}</ref> To the northeastern end of the province, along the border with Quảng Ninh there is the Khe Rỗ forest, spanning 71.53&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with a rich biodiversity.

==Economy==
Bắc Giang's land area is primarily dedicated to agriculture. The province is becoming known as a producer of fruit, particularly [[pineapple]]s and [[lychee]]s. Around a quarter of Bắc Giang's land area is devoted to forestry. Located {{convert|50|km|mi}} from Hanoi, the province is within both the Hanoi-Hải Phong-Quảng Ninh Economic Corridor, and the Nam Ninh-Lạng Sơn-Hanoi-Hải Phong-Quảng Ninh Economic Corridor. Before the province was formulated in 1997 and industrial development of the region was initiated, the GDP of the province was only US$170 with Agro-Forestry accounting for 55% and Industry hardly contributed. It was a poor economy with 90% of agricultural workers remaining below the poverty line. However, during the period 1997–2008, the province having launched several industrial projects in all its districts, 410 projects were launched with investment of US$23.174 billion that included 74 "Foreign Direct Investment" projects worth US$432.9 million. As a result, several economic farming models were introduced, which resulted in "Rural Economic Development", social consumer retail sales, and services got a boost, the poverty rate (2005 level) reduced to 17.78%, and textiles and garment exports accounted for about US$130 million, which was 76% of the province's export turnover.

Infrastructure such as National Highways and rural roads were substantially expanded, towns were better planned and beautified. Industrial parks, urban Areas-service and high-tech parks are being added. Key Industries like fertilizer, high technology, engineering, building materials, assembling automobiles, agricultural processing, forestry products, textiles and electric power generation are planned with the objective of achieving a GDP growth rate of 11-12% by 2020.<ref name=plan>{{Cite web|url=http://translate.google.co.in/translate?hl=en&sl=vi&u=http://www.bacgiangdpi.gov.vn/&ei=FlB6TInRK9P0cOim5ZgG&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=12&ved=0CEMQ7gEwCw&prev=/search%3Fq%3DBac%2BGiang%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG |title=Bắc Giang Department of Planning and Investment|access-date=29 August 2010}}</ref> The province has the Bắc Giang Department of Industry and Trade established in 2008 by the Bắc Giang People's Committee, which unifies the Department of Industry and the Department of Trade and Tourism; this testifies to the importance given to promote industrial development of the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bacgiangintrade.gov.vn/so-cong-thuong-Bac-Giang.gplist.244.gpopen.1117.gpside.2.gpnewtitle.bac-giang-department-of-industry-and-trade-tasks-and-powers.asmx |title=Bắc Giang Department of Industry and Trade tasks and powers |access-date=29 August 2010 |publisher=Bắc Giang Department of Industry and Trade }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

;Thac Huong irrigation scheme
The Thac Huong Irrigation Scheme in the Yên Thế district, adjacent to Thái Nguyên province and west of Hanoi, was implemented in the early 20th century by the-then French colonial government. Construction of the irrigation scheme for utilization of the Cầu River was started in 1922 and operationalised in 1936. The irrigation system was built on the left bank of the river and envisaged irrigation to a total command area of {{convert|57325|ha|acre}}. Net irrigation provided was to an area of {{convert|28500|ha|acre}} in Phú Binh (Thái Nguyên province), Việt Yên, Tan Yên, and Hiệp Hoà (in Bắc Giang Province). Additionally, a supply of potable drinking water was built into the system. Navigation was part of its beneficial uses as a transport route for shipment of rice and salt from [[Hai Phong]] to [[Thái Nguyên]]. The scheme, as built, has a concrete dam of {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} height and {{convert|100|m|ft}} length, known as the Thac Huong dam across the Cầu River. A head regulator on the canal is {{convert|36|m|ft}} in width and {{convert|6.5|m|ft}} in height. 10 branch canal intakes were provided, each with a capacity of 25m3/s. However, the energy dissipation arrangements of the dam have been damaged, several times since it was built, by floods and bombing raids. The [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) funded the rehabilitation project in 2000. Although restored after 1955, the project is facing water shortages and is unable to meet the demands for irrigation due to building of many projects in the upstream reaches of the river, over utilisation by industries and poor maintenance. Transbasin diversions have been implemented along with pumping from other streams to meet the water demands for irrigation and other uses of drinking water and industries.<ref name=irrigation>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/water/NARBO/2005/Thematic-Workshop/report-Bac-Giang.pdf|title=Irrigation Management Company of Bắc Giang: Water Rights and Water Allocation in Irrigation Scheme of Cầu River, Bắc Giang|access-date=29 August 2010|publisher=Bắc Giang Department of Agriculture and Rural Development}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

;Đức La Pagoda
The Đức La pagoda, located in the Trí Yên commune of Yên Dung district, was built in the 12th century and is well preserved. It was then the centre of the "Trúc Lâm Trinity" (King Trần Nhân Tông, Pháp Loa and Huyền Quang monks) who established a school of Buddhist preaching and founded the Trúc Lâm religious sect. The pagoda is set in the backdrop of the Co Tien Mountain range at the Phuong Nhon confluence. The pagoda is surrounded by an expanse of rice-fields, amidst villages and hamlets around green bamboo groves. The "99 Nham Bien Mountain range" is seen at a distance. The pagoda is built on a south-west axis and has four principal zones. The first zone has the Ho and Thieu Huong Buddhist pagodas. There are two Thap Dien niches where very large statues of Thien Wong, Dia Tang and Long Than are installed. The Thien Huong Palace, adjacent to this, is an exquisite structure, which has three horizontal panels and a gilded door. The first chamber of Buddha is the architectural legacy of the Lê dynasty. The second zone is separated from the first zone by a brick yard. Within this zone is a simple building built with wooden planks and decorated with natural scenes of sky and clouds. It is the first ancestral shrine, and a panel here has the inscription "Trúc Lâm ho thuong" (A rendezvous of the Trúc Lâm Trinity) in [[Chinese character]]s. This inscription is engraved above the three statues of the Trúc Lâm Trinity. The third zone has the two-roofed bell tower. The fourth zone is another ancestral shrine with two statues made in the architectural style of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. The Đức La pagoda is also an important training centre of Buddhism. The pagoda also has wooden printing blocks of [[Buddhist sutras]].<ref name=cycling/>

;Tho Ha Communal House
The Tho Ha Communal House, located in Tho Ha village, Việt Yên district, was built during the rule of King Lê Hy Tong.

At the four corners, decorated with purple-burned glazed terra-cotta creatures of lion cubs are depicted. It has 22 levels engraved with dragons, clouds, and lion cubs. The communal house has 7 rooms built on 48 [[ironwood]] pillars. The roof frame is decorated with engravings of "ladies in long dresses wearing their hair in buns or turbans, riding phoenixes and dragons or dancing over the floating clouds". Polished blue stones decorate the floor of the house. It has a wooden entrance engraved and painted in gold which gives it an ancient ambience. There is also an inscription on a stone, which says that the Tho Ha Communal House was built out of contributions from local villagers.<ref name=cycling/>

;ATK2
