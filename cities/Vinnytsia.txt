'''Vinnytsia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|n|ɪ|t|s|(|j|)|ə|,_|ˈ|v|iː|n|-}} {{respell|VIN|it|s(y)ə|,_|VEEN|-}}; {{langx|uk|Вінниця}}, {{IPA|uk|ˈwinːɪtsʲɐ|IPA|uk-Вінниця.ogg}}) is a [[city]] in west-central [[Ukraine]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Vinnytsya |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Vinnytsya-Ukraine |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> located on the banks of the [[Southern Bug]]. It serves as the [[administrative centre|administrative center]] of [[Vinnytsia Oblast]]. It is the largest city in the historic region of [[Podillia]]. It also serves as the administrative center of [[Vinnytsia Raion]], one of the six raions of Vinnytsia Oblast. It has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|369,739|.}}

The city's roots date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. It was under [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] and [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish control]] for centuries. From 1653 to 1667, Vinnytsia was a regimental city of the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetman state]], and in 1793, it was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]]. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the city was the site of massacres, first during [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] purges and then during [[the Holocaust in Ukraine]] and the [[Nazi occupation]]. A [[Cold War]]–era [[Havryshivka Vinnytsia International Airport|airbase]] was located near the city. Currently, Vinnytsia is developing as one of the most comfortable cities for life in independent Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moving to Vinnytsia |url=https://www.vmr.gov.ua/en/moving-to-vinnitsa |access-date=2022-12-27 |website=www.vmr.gov.ua |language=en-US}}</ref>

The name of Vinnytsia appeared for the first time in 1363. It is assumed that the name is derived from the [[Proto-Slavic]] word "[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/věno|*věno]]" (''вѣно''), meaning "a bride price." This name can be explained by the fact that Vinnytsia and the surrounding land were captured by [[Lithuania]]n Duke [[Algirdas]] in the 14th century, and then, they were given to his nephews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diclib.com/cgi-bin/d1.cgi?l=ru&base=geo_rus&page=showid&id=1223#.V1KMRE2R_IU |title=Винница / определение слова Винница – город, ц.

In addition to the Ukrainian {{lang|uk|Вінниця}} (''Vinnytsia''), in other languages of the region, the name of the city is {{langx|ru|Винница|Vinnitsa}}, {{langx|pl|Winnica}}, {{langx|lt|Vinica}}, {{langx|de|Winniza}}, {{langx|ro|Vinița}} and {{langx|yi|וויניצע|Vinitse}}. English sources used the Russian-derived '''Vinnitsa''' from the early 19th century until the 1990s and '''Winnica''' or '''Winnicza''' (from Polish) before that, reflecting the ultimate political authorities of those respective eras.

Vinnytsia has been an important trade and political center since the fourteenth century, when [[Fyodor Koriatovych]], the nephew of the [[Lithuania]]n Duke [[Algirdas]], built a fortress (1363) against [[Tatar]] raiders on the banks of the [[Southern Bug]]. The original settlement was built and populated by Aleksander Hrehorovicz Jelec, a [[hetman]] under Lithuanian Prince [[Švitrigaila]]. Aleksander Jelec built the fort, which he commanded as [[starosta]] afterwards.

In the 15th century, Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Alexander Jagiellon]] granted Vinnytsia [[Magdeburg city rights]]. In 1566, it became part of the [[Bracław Voivodeship]]. Between 1569 and 1793 the town was a part of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]]. In 1648, Vinnytsia found itself at the epicenter of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Cossack uprisings]] led by [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. In February 1651, during the defense of the city, [[Ivan Bohun|Ivan Bohun's]] Cossack regiment defeated a 20,000-strong Polish army. Vinnytsia was part of the Hetman state until 1667, and during 1672-1699 was a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (and still part of the historic region of [[Podolia]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Podolia |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/podolia |website=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=AICE |access-date=31 December 2020}}</ref> During Polish rule, Vinnytsia was a Polish [[royal city]]. On 18 March 1783, [[Antoni Protazy Potocki]] opened the [[Polish Trade Company]] in Vinnytsia. The 1st Infantry Regiment of the Polish [[Crown Army]] was stationed in the city in 1788 before it was relocated to [[Piotrków Trybunalski]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gembarzewski|first=Bronisław|title=Rodowody pułków polskich i oddziałów równorzędnych od r. 1717 do r. 1831|year=1925|language=pl|publisher=Towarzystwo Wiedzy Wojskowej|location=Warszawa|page=26}}</ref>

After the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 the [[Russian Empire]] annexed the city and the region. Russia moved to expunge the [[Roman Catholic]] religion. Catholic churches in the city, including what is currently the Transfiguration Cathedral, were converted to [[Russian Orthodox]] churches.

[[File:Vinnytsia-1910s.jpg|thumb|upright|Vinnytsia on a 1910s postcard]]
In the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census of 1897]], Vinnytsia had a population of 30,563. It was the third largest city in [[Podolia]] region after [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] and [[Uman]]. After railway connections were completed in 1871, Vinnytsia developed rapidly economically and infrastructurally. The city architect Hryhorii Artynov erected a number of buildings (a water tower, a theater, churches, hotels and mansions), which still shape the city image.

During the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1920]], Vinnytsia was chosen three times as the seat of government structures of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. The residence of the Directory was Savoy Hotel, which turned the city into a de facto capital. On 16 May 1920, a meeting was held in Vinnytsia between the heads of Ukraine and Poland, [[Symon Petliura]] and [[Józef Piłsudski]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-21 |title=Piłsudski and Petliura: Together against the Bolsheviks |url=https://polishhistory.pl/pilsudski-and-petliura-together-against-the-bolsheviks/ |access-date=2022-12-27 |website=Polish History |language=en-US}}</ref>

Soviet Vinnytsia became an industrial giant with an emphasis on [[Sugar industry|sugar production]], but in the shadow of its prosperity it experienced a devastating man-made famine occurred in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] from [[Holodomor|1932 to 1933]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historical Photographs of the Holodomor |url=https://education.holodomor.ca/educational-resources-list/photo-gallery/historical-photographs-of-the-holodomor-2/ |access-date=2024-05-16 |website=HREC Education |language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Vinnytsia massacre]] was the mass execution of between 9,000 and 11,000 people in Vinnytsia by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] secret police [[NKVD]] during the [[Great Purge]] in 1937–1938.<ref name="Dzerkalo">Valery Vasiliev, Yuriy Shapoval, "Stages of «Great Terror»: The Vinnytsia Tragedy", ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]'', № 31 (406), 17–23 August 2002, ([http://www.zn.ua/3000/3150/35760/ in Russian] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128161455/http://www.zn.ua/3000/3150/35760/ |date=2007-11-28 }}, [http://www.dt.ua/3000/3150/35760/ in Ukrainian]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518004957/http://www.dt.ua/3000/3150/35760/ |date=2009-05-18 }})</ref>

Vinnytsia was occupied by German troops on 19 July 1941 during [[World War II]].
