'''Tarhuna''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɑr|ˈ|h|uː|n|ə}}; {{langx|ar|ترهونة}}), also '''Tarhoona''' or '''Tarhunah''', is a [[Libya]]n village {{convert|65|km}} to the southeast of [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]], in the [[Murqub District]]. The [[Tarhuna District]], including the city of [[Msallata]], had an urban population of about 296,000 (est. 2003). The population in Tarhuna proper was calculated to be 13,264 in 2011.<ref name=worldgazetteer>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1273372850&men=gcis&lng=en&des=gamelan&geo=-133&srt=dpnn&col=abcdefghimoq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&srt=pdnn|title=Data from World Gazetteer|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121204173451/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1273372850&men=gcis&lng=en&des=gamelan&geo=-133&srt=dpnn&col=abcdefghimoq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&srt=pdnn|archivedate=4 December 2012}}</ref>

Its geographical boundaries are from the Valley of the famm Molgha west to Burkaat Oueny eastward, from the Suq al Juma (Al-msab`ha) north, and Al-mzawgha and Marghna south.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080121161724/http://en.ljbc.net/online/lypop.htm "Libya 2003 Census of Population"] Libyan national authority for information and authentication, archive from [[Internet Archive]], 21 January 2008</ref>

==History==
In the city centre of Tarhuna, just opposite the Tarhuna mosque, there is a memorial to Ali Swidan Alhatmy, who was a hero in the 18 June 1915 Battle of El-Shqiga against the Italians. He was captured in 1922 and hanged by the Italians in the town square.

The population generally belongs to the Tarhuna tribe, which was favoured during the regime of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. In late August 2011 (as part of the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]), opposition forces from the [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|National Liberation Amy]] entered Tarhuna, amidst mixed feelings from the citizens.<ref>[http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/276871/gadhafi-loyalists-remain-firm "Gadhafi loyalists remain firm."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523174430/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/276871/gadhafi-loyalists-remain-firm |date=23 May 2012 }} Concord Monitor/AP, 31 August 2011. Retrieved 2011-08-31.</ref>

On 23 August 2012, Interior ministry spokesman Abdelmonem al-Hur stated that more than 100 tanks and 26 rocket launchers were seized from an alleged pro-Gaddafi militia (named ''Katibat Al-Awfiyah'', or Brigade of the Faithful), during a raid on their campsite in Tarhuna. The operation ended with one of the suspects killed, eight wounded and thirteen detainees, accused of being linked with the 19 August Tripoli bombings.<ref>{{cite news|title=At least 12 killed in tribal clash in Libya|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48772032/ns/world_news-africa/t/least-killed-tribal-clash-libya/#.UE81B3kZRO0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104020234/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48772032/ns/world_news-africa/t/least-killed-tribal-clash-libya/%23.UE81B3kZRO0|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 January 2013|work=[[NBC]]|agency=Reuters|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Libya seizes tanks from pro-Gaddafi militia|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19364536|publisher=BBC|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tanks seized from pro-Gaddafi militia|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/tanks-seized-from-pro-gaddafi-militia/story-e6freoo6-1226457112174|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]]|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref>

According to reports in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Tarhuna was dominated between 2011 and 2020 by the Kani brothers and their militia, the Kaniyat. Imposing a reign of terror, the Kaniyat were allegedly responsible for hundreds of killings in the town, with the collusion of the [[Government of National Accord]].<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/libya-tarhuna-kaniyat-mass-graves/?itid=hp-top-table-main-0430b| title = Libyan mass graves: Kaniyat militia accused of Tarhuna killings| author = Raghavan, Sudarsan| date = May 8, 2021| accessdate = May 10, 2021| work = The Washington Post}}</ref> In 2019, the Kaniyat switched allegiance to the warlord [[Khalifa Haftar]]-led [[Libyan National Army|LNA]] forces during the [[Second Libyan Civil War]], and became the LNA's stronghold in western Libya. On 18 April [[2020 in Libya|2020]], the forces of the UN-recognized [[Government of National Accord|GNA]] government, with the backing of Turkish drones, launched a major offensive with the aim to reclaim Tarhuna from Haftar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/2241506/casualties-lna-gna-forces-clash-tripoli-tarhuna|title=Casualties as LNA, GNA Forces Clash in Tripoli, Tarhuna|website=aawsat.com|date=19 April 2020}}</ref> On 5 June, it was captured by the GNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-libya-security-idUKKBN23C11Q|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200605084421/https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-libya-security-idUKKBN23C11Q|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 June 2020|title=Libyan government says it has entered Haftar stronghold Tarhouna|date=5 June 2020|access-date=5 June 2020|via=uk.reuters.com}}</ref> Explosive devices, landmines, and mass graves of civilians, many buried alive, were discovered in the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=UN chief shocked at Libya mass graves in recently freed town |url=https://news.yahoo.com/turkeys-military-conducts-air-sea-143509059.html |website=news.yahoo.com |accessdate=June 13, 2020}}</ref>

During the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the RAF established a bombing range on the outskirts of the town. It was manned by RAF personnel from nearby RAF Idris and it was used by Canberra bombers from various bases in Germany. The range consisted of a main control tower with full equipment for communication with the bomber crews, at 45 degrees to the left was a quadrant tower to cross reference the plotting of the bomb hits, to convey the strike position of each bomb, and a target constructed out of 45 gallon oil drums, filled with concrete and built into a pyramid approximately 40-50 feet high and painted white. The range was used to practice the art of a new manouvre known as LABS (low altitude bombing system), where the bomb is launched in a lob towards the target, so that by the time the bomb hits the target, the aircraft has retreated at high altitude and at high speed.{{citation needed|date=February 2024|reason=Entire paragraph lacks sources.}}
