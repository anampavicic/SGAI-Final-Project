==History==
Divinópolis was founded in 1767 by 50 families who lived in the lands near the Itapecerica and Pará rivers. The first settlement took root near the waterfalls on the Itapecerica and was called Paragem da Itapecerica in reference to the river. In 1770 it became Espírito Santo da Itapecerica and was a district of Tamanduá. In 1912 it became a city with the name Divinópolis (City of the Holy Spirit) in homage to the older name of Espírito Santo.

The arrival of the [[Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas]] (a narrow gauge railroad) in 1890 offered the city opportunities for the installation of industries of iron and steel, providing a reasonable [[standard of living]], as well as a high level of social development.

==Economy==

The main economic activities are services, industry, and agriculture. The GDP in 2005 was approximately 2 billion reais, with 244 million reais coming from taxes, 1,215,000 reais from services, 603,000 reais from industry, and 45,000 reais from agriculture. In 2005 there were 1,947 transformation industries employing 16,687 people and 4,526 retail units employing 16,559 people. Public administration employed 3,972 people and health services employed 2,434 people.

In the rural area there were 942 farms on 31,000 hectares (2006). 1,200 people were engaged in the agricultural sector. The main crops were citrus fruits, rice, beans, and corn. There were 43,000 head of cattle, of which 10,000 were dairy cattle.<ref name="IBGE">[http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php IBGE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109005631/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php |date=January 9, 2007 }}</ref>

At the end of the 1970s the economic problems of the steel industry caused factories to close and many workers to be laid off. The difficulties forced the appearance of clothing factories, which were an important economic alternative. In addition to clothing, the city produces beverages, dairy products, and meat products.

==Transport==
Divinópolis has the [[Brigadeiro Cabral Airport]].

==Health and education==
In the health sector there were 94 establishments, of which 36 were public and 56 were private (2005). There were 36 specialized health clinics and 4 hospitals with 593 beds. (2005). Patients with more serious health conditions are transported to [[Belo Horizonte]].

Education needs of 44,000 students were met by 93 primary schools, 32 middle schools, and 92 pre-primary schools.<ref name="IBGE"/>

There are five institutions that provide higher education: Instituto Superior de Educação de Divinópolis (ISED), Faculdade de Arte e Design (FAD), Faculdade de Ciências Econômicas e Administrativas de Divinópolis (FACED), Instituto de Ensino Superior e Pesquisa (INESP), and Faculdades Integradas do Oeste de Minas (FADOM).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mundovestibular.com.br/categories/Universidades/Minas-Gerais/DIVIN%C3%93POLIS/ |title=Mundo Vestibular |access-date=2008-08-26 |archive-date=2008-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028083818/http://www.mundovestibular.com.br/categories/Universidades/Minas-Gerais/DIVIN%C3%93POLIS/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> There is a satellite campus of the Federal University of São João del-Rei (UFSJ), which goes by the name of "Dona Lindu", in homage to president Lula's mother.
