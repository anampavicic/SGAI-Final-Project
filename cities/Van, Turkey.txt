It is the capital and largest city of Van Province.

Van has a long history as a major urban area. It has been a large city since the first millennium [[Common Era|BCE]], initially as [[Tushpa]], the capital of the kingdom of [[Urartu]] from the 9th century BCE to the 6th century BCE, and later as the center of the Armenian kingdom of [[Kingdom of Vaspurakan|Vaspurakan]]. Turkic presence in Van and in the rest of [[Anatolia]] started as a result of [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] victory at the [[Battle of Malazgirt]] (1071) against the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>Haldon, John.

Van was densely populated by [[Armenians]] until the [[Armenian genocide]] in the 1910s. Today, it is mostly inhabited by [[Kurds]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pinson |first=Mark |date=February 1985 |title=Justin McCarthy.

==History==
[[File:UrartianCaldron02.jpg|thumb|An Urartian cauldron at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]]]]
Archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in [[Van Province]] indicate that the history of human settlement in this region goes back at least as far as 5000 BCE. The [[Tilkitepe Mound]], which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.

===Urartu===
[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|[[Xerxes I inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below Van castle]]
Under the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BCE. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Fortress|Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE have been found here. The name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartianlanguage|Urartian]] endonym ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31.</ref>

===Kingdom of Armenia===
The region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BCE and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BCE. [[Van Fortress]], located outside Van city center, holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BCE upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BCE, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BCE it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BCE.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies – Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BCE, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century CE. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm|title=The Kingdom of van (Urartu) by A.

Following the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE)]</ref> the town fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years-long [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars were waged at and around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&pg=PT1462 The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1–5 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

===Seljuk Empire and Rum===
Incursions by the [[Seljuk Turks]] into Vaspurakan started in the 1050s. After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control.<ref>"The Turks in History", Roderic H. Davison, ''Essays in Ottoman and Turkish History, 1774–1923: The Impact of the West'', (University of Texas Press, 1990), 3.</ref> After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.

===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===

The first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring [[Persians|Persian]] [[Safavid|Safavid Empire]]. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town was confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1604, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].

During the early 1900s, the city of Van had eleven Armenian schools and ten Turkish schools.<ref name="Hewsen-2000">{{Armenian Van-Vaspurakan 2000|first=Robert H.|last=Hewsen|author-link=Robert H.

During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewsen 2000, p. 39.</ref>

====Ottoman Era demographics====
The demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it has been estimated that it had around 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman census, the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 [[Armenians]].<ref name=":0">Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children, and according to more recent research, an estimate for Van province (including women and children) is that it had 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>

The demographics of Van are a greatly debated point also given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen 2000, p. 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>{{Armenian Van-Vaspurakan 2000 |last=Ter Minassian |first=Anahide |author-link=Anahide Ter Minassian |title=10: The City of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century |p=179}}</ref> The French Consul in Van reported that in Van and Bitlis 51.46% were [[Kurds]], 32.70% were [[Armenians]] and 5.53% were Turks.<ref>Ter Minassian, ch.10, p. 180.</ref> On the other hand, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople estimated 185,000 [[Armenians]] in Van, 18,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], 72,000 [[Kurds]], 47,000 [[Turkish people|Turks]], 25,000 [[Yezidis]], 5,000 [[Zazas]] and 3,000 [[Gypsies]].<ref name=":1">Ter Minassian, ch.10, p. 181.</ref> Both sides have been accused of over-counting the numbers at the time given the [[Armenian genocide]] and population statistics became important during the [[Berlin Conference]].<ref>Sarkis Y.

===The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878===
During this war the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] Sheikh Jelaludin led thousands of soldiers to massacre [[Armenians]] of the province and destroyed and plundered many of their villages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/03/06/who-was-sheikh-jalaleddin/ |title=Who Was Sheikh Jalaleddin? |access-date=11 March 2019 |archive-date=26 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026104537/https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/03/06/who-was-sheikh-jalaleddin/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> These events are described in ''Armenia and the Campaign of 1877'' by British war correspondent Charles B.

In April 1915, as slaughter was being inflicted upon the rural populations surrounding Van, the Armenian residents of the city [[Defense of Van (1915)|launched a rebellion]] hoping to avoid the same fate, defending themselves in the Armenian quarters of the city against the Turks.<ref name="gens">The Banality of Indifference: Zionism and the Armenian Genocide – Page 42 by Yaïr Auron</ref> The Russians finally relieved the Armenian defenders of Van in late May 1915 and local Armenians gave the keys of the city to Russian general [[Nikolai Yudenich]] on May 21. In August, a victory over the Russian army allowed the Ottoman army to retake Van. In September 1915, the Russians forced the Turks out of Van for the second time. Russian forces began to leave the area after the [[October Revolution]] in Russia in 1917, and by April 1918, it was recaptured by the Ottoman army again. According to Taner Akçam, citing the ''Osmanli Belgelerinde Ermeniler 1915–1920'' (Armenians in Ottoman Documents, 1915–1920), after the Turks took back the city from the Russians, they killed the Armenian population in the city.<ref>Akçam, p. 140.</ref> [[Clarence Ussher]], an American physician and missionary in Van, and an eye-witness to the events, reported that 55,000 Armenians had been killed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Richard L.|title=Jihad and genocide|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0742562028|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYez6YcL-B8C|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref><ref name="Sjacobs">{{cite book|last=L.

In the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] decided to cede the city to the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. [[Turkish revolutionaries]], led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], rejected the terms of the treaty and instead waged the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. However, the idea of ceding Van to the Armenians was floated, and [[İsmet İnönü]] was said to have surveyed army officers on 14 October 1919 on the issue of ceding Van and [[Bitlis]].

By the end of the conflicts, the town of Van was empty and in ruins. The city was rebuilt after the war a few kilometers east of the ancient citadel, which is now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''). The city now lies at about {{convert|1,750|m|0|abbr=off}} above sea level.

[[File:2019 Turkish local elections BDP & HDP.png|thumb|HDP won in a landslide in Van in the 2019 municipal elections.]]
In the [[2019 Turkish local elections|2019 municipal elections]], [[Bedia Özgökçe Ertan]] of the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|HDP]] party was elected mayor of Van. In August 2019 she was dismissed and subsequently sentenced to 30 years imprisonment accused of supporting terrorism as part of a government crackdown against politicians of the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|HDP]] party; the Turkish state appointed an unelected state-trustee, [[Mehmet Emin Bilmez]], in her place.

[[File:Wan_JPG.jpg|thumb|left|260px|View of the city from Van Castle]]
The modern city is located on the plain extending from the [[Lake Van]], at a distance of {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} from the lake shore. Reports have appeared over the years of a certain [[Lake Van Monster]] said to live in the lake. [[Lake Erçek]] is the second largest lake in the region and lies just east of Lake Van.

Van has often been called "The Pearl of the East" because of the beauty of its surrounding landscape. An old Armenian proverb in the same sense is "Van in this world, paradise in the next".<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hewsen | first = Robert H. |author-link=Robert H. Hewsen | title = Armenia: A Historical Atlas | year = 2001 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | isbn = 0-226-33228-4 | pages = 207 }}</ref> This phrase has been slightly modified in Turkish as ''Dünyada Van, ahirette iman'' or "Van for this world, faith for the next".

The city is home to [[Van Yüzüncü Yıl Üniversitesi]] (''Van 100th Year University'') and recently came to the headlines for two highly publicized investigations initiated by the Prosecutor of Van, one of which was focused on accusations against the university's [[Rector (academia)|rector]], [[Hasan Ceylan]], who was kept in custody for a time. He was finally acquitted but lost his rectorate. He is a grandson of [[Güllü Agop|Agop Vartovyan]], an Ottoman Armenian who is accepted as the founder of modern Turkish theatre. Hasan Ceylan is also the department chairman of Environmental Engineering at [[Van Yüzüncü Yıl University]].

==Cuisine==
In culinary terms, as some cities in Turkey became renowned for their [[kebab]] culture or other types of traditional local dishes, Van has distinguished itself with its breakfast culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180715-the-turkish-city-that-lives-for-breakfast|title=The Turkish city that lives for breakfast|last=Osterlund|first=Paul Benjamin|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:Van_Ferit_Melen_Airport.jpg|thumb|left|Van Ferit Melen Airport]]
[[File:Van_Railway_Station.jpg|thumb|Van Railway Station]]
Van stands on Highway D300, which runs from the Iranian border 100&nbsp;km east at Kapikoy through Van then along the south lake shore to [[Tatvan]] (100&nbsp;km), and westwards to the rest of Turkey. Highway D975 runs north to Dogubeyazit and south towards Hakkari. Frequent buses and dolmuses ply these highways.

Van is the western terminus of [[Van-Sufian railway|the railway line from Iran]], with freight and passenger trains (suspended between 2015 and 2018). There is a [[train ferry]] (upgraded in 2015) across the lake to Tatvan. There is no railway around the lake; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans.{{cn|date=August 2023}} This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Tatvan is the terminus of the line to Ankara and Istanbul.

Van has daily flights to Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities from [[Van Ferit Melen Airport|Ferit Melen Airport]].

==Media==
Near Van, there is a [[longwave]] broadcasting station with a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} guyed mast. It went in service in 1990 and operates on 225&nbsp;kHz with 600&nbsp;kW. It has also local news outlets like ''Van Gazetesi'' or ''Gazete Van.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vanhavadis.com/|title=Van Havadıs Gazetesı {{!}} Van Haber, Son Dakika, Van Haberleri|website=vanhavadis.com|language=tr|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vangazetesi.com/|title=Van Gazetesi|website=Türkiye'nin Uluslararası Haber Sitesi ve Gazetesi|language=tr|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>
