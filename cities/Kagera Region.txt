'''Kagera Region''' (''Mkoa wa Kagera'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is one of [[Tanzania]]'s 31 [[Regions of Tanzania|administrative regions]]. The region covers an area of {{cvt|35,686|km2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geita.go.tz |title=Kagera Region Size}}</ref> The region is comparable in size to the land area of the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{Convert|33,481|km2|abbr=on}} for Netherlands at {{cite news| url=https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/countries_by_area.htm|title= Area size comparison| publisher=Nations Online| year=2022| access-date=9 October 2022}}</ref> Kagera Region is bordered to the east by [[Lake Victoria]], [[Mwanza Region]] and [[Mara Region]]. The region is bordered to the south by [[Geita Region]] and [[Kigoma Region]]. Lastly, Kagera borders [[Rwanda]] to the west, [[Uganda]] to the north and [[Burundi]] to the south west.
The regional capital city is [[Bukoba]]. According to the 2022 national census, the region had a population of 2,989,299, an increase from 2,458,023 recorded in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tanzania country profile|url=https://www.nbs.go.tz/index.php/sw/sensa-2022/807-matokaeo-ya-mwanzo-ya-sensa-ya-watu-na-makazi-ya-mwaka-2022|url-status=live|access-date=31 January 2023|archive-date=2021-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831184708/http://www.clgf.org.uk/default/assets/File/Country_profiles/Tanzania.pdf}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The region derives its name from the [[Kagera River]].

== Geography ==
Kagera borders Uganda to the north, Rwanda and Burundi to the west, and the Tanzanian regions [[Kigoma Region|Kigoma]] to the south and [[Geita]] to the east. The [[Kagera River]] forms the region's border with Rwanda. The region lies in the middle of 30°25' and 32°40' east, and 1°00' and 2°45' south. The total area is {{convert|35686|km2}}, of which {{convert|25513|km2}} is land and 27 percent, and {{convert|10173|km2}} is water. Much of the water is that of the great lake, [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], as well as lakes Ikimba, [[Lake Burigi|Burigi]], Ngono and the [[Kagera River]]. Kagera is Tanzania's fifteenth-largest region and accounts for approximately 3.3 percent of Tanzania's land area of {{convert|885800|km2}}. The regional capital [[Bukoba]] is about {{convert|1500|km}} from [[Dar es Salaam]].<ref name="Kagera_webHist" />

===Climate===
With an average annual rainfall of 500 to 2000 mms, the Kagera Region has a bi-modal rainfall pattern from March to May and from October to November. Rainfall varies from 2000&nbsp;mm per year in Bukoba to 500&nbsp;mm in the west, with rainfall being higher along Lake Victoria's coasts and decreasing inland and away from the lake as well as with height. The temperature ranges from 20 degrees Celsius to 28 degrees Celsius. The area is made up of a number of hills that run parallel to the lake's edge and north to south.<ref name="Report2022"/>

=== Geology ===
Lying on the [[Albertine Rift|Kivu Rift]], the western of the two branches of the [[East African Rift]] which transverses Tanzania, Kagera experiences significant seismic activity. On 10 September 2016, the region was struck by [[2016 Tanzania earthquake|a 5.9 magnitude earthquake]] in which 17 people died, and at least 250 others were injured.<ref name="Mulibo_16">{{cite journal |last1=Mulibo |first1=Gabriel D. |title=Investigation of macroseismic intensity of the Mw5.9 September 10, 2016 Kagera earthquake: Implications for site effect amplification |journal=[[Journal of African Earth Sciences]] |date=1 November 2019 |volume=159 |page=103568 |doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103568 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1464343X19302213 |access-date=2 July 2022 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Dar es Salaam, Tanzania]] |bibcode=2019JAfES.15903568M |s2cid=200054374 |issn=1464-343X}}</ref><ref name="Bashaya_16">{{cite news |last1=Bashaya |first1=Phinias |title=Sh1.4 billion raised for earthquake survivors |url=https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Sh1-4-billion-raised-for-earthquake-survivors/1840340-3380484-xt9ao9/index.html |access-date=2 July 2022 |work=[[The Citizen (Tanzania)]] |publisher=[[Mwananchi Communications]] |date=14 September 2016 |location=[[Dar es Salaam, Tanzania]] }}</ref>

Kagera is known for its agriculture, lush landscapes, and wildlife. It has reasonably fertile old soils but climate change has led to [[soil exhaustion]] and a need to use [[fertiliser]].<ref name="Li_21">{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Chaodong |last2=Li |first2=Zhanbin |last3=Yang |first3=Mingyi |last4=Ma |first4=Bo |last5=Wang |first5=Baiqun |editor1-last=Tchounwou |editor1-first=Paul |title=Grid-Scale Impact of Climate Change and Human Influence on Soil Erosion within East African Highlands (Kagera Basin) |journal=[[International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health]] |date=9 March 2021 |volume=18 |issue=5 |page=2775 |doi=10.3390/ijerph18052775 |pmid=33803377 |pmc=7967286 |issn=1660-4601|doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===
One of the top five most populous regions in the nation is the Kagera region. According to the population and housing Census of 2002, the region had a total population of 2,033,888, with an average growth rate of 3.1%. 6.0% of all Tanzanians living on the mainland were found in the region.<ref name="Report2022"/>

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2022}}
During colonization the region was a district called West Lake, that was a part of the Lake Province, that included the [[Geita Region|Geita]], [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]], [[Shinyanga]], [[Tabora Region|Tabora]], [[Simiyu Region|Simiyu]], and [[Mara Region|Mara]], regions. After independence Lake Province was broken up into regions, with Kagera and part of Geita becoming the West Lake Region. Following the [[Uganda–Tanzania War|Kagera War]] in 1979, the West Lake Region was renamed the Kagera Region.<ref name="Kagera_webHist">{{cite web |title=Historia ya Mkoa wa Kagera |trans-title=History of Kagera Region |url=https://kagera.go.tz/historia |website=Mkoa wa Kagera |publisher=Ofisi ya Mkuu wa Mkoa Kagera |access-date=1 July 2022 |location=[[Bukoba, Tanzania]] |language=sw |date=2017}}</ref>

For a period of about five centuries, Kagera was home to nine different kingdoms with highly [[hierarchical]] societies. Before European colonialism, coffee was a traditional crop in the area, used for its stimulant properties and in local cultural rituals. During colonial times, coffee was transformed into a cash crop. Bananas were a [[staple food]] in the region. Although there was a gender-based division of labour in the traditional Bahaya society, women of the time were not thought to be inferior to men. In fact women commanded special respect in all traditional rituals. For example, upon the death of a head of a family (Nyin'enju), during the following inheritance rituals, the "Main Inheritor" (Omusika) had to have a female counterpart selected from among his sisters to share his authority. Similarly, upon the death of a reigning king, during the crowning of the next king, there had to be a "sister to the nation" (''Kinyany'engoma'') who was also selected from among his sisters.

The kings lived in elaborate palaces and were respected as the direct link to gods of their kingdoms. The authority of the nine kingdoms (Kihanja, Karagwe, Kiziba, Misenye, Bugabo, Kyamtwara, Ihangiro, Bukara and [[Biharamulo]]) was diminished when [[Germany|Germans]] [[German East Africa|colonised Tanzania]] in 1885 and supported the [[Haya people|Haya]], the ethnic group of Bukoba and Muleba Districts over the other districts. However, the local kings held on to power. The demise of these kingdoms came after Tanzania gained its independence and [[President of Tanzania|president]] [[Julius Nyerere|Nyerere]] considered them detrimental to national unity.

There was a chief called Omukama (the word meant a king or chief) who could be born with that authority. Some prominent chiefs in Kagera include Kyamukuma, who is a last{{clarify|date=December 2019}} chief in Misenye (currently [[Missenyi District]]).<ref>Seth, Niyikiza [The new Haya Transformation, The legacy of Babumbilo (2014)]</ref> Other chiefs include Rumanyika of Karagwe, Ruhinda, Kahigi and other inferior chiefs. Kahigi is among the chiefs who waived their territories by collaborating with German colonialists.

Cultural tours are available for tourists visiting Kagera and can be accessed from the region's capital of [[Bukoba]]. These tours include visits to the region's national parks/nature reserves etc.

During German rule Dr. M. Zupitza, then serving as the local medical officer, encountered the plague outbreak in Kiziba (1897–1898). In cooperation with Dr. [[Robert Koch]], he confirmed that the cause was the same bacteria as the outbreak in [[Bombay]].

When authority was transferred to the British who supplanted the Germans, Kagera was open to [[Lutheran]] [[missionary]] activity. Other Christian denominations including the [[Roman Catholic]] church later arrived. Their legacy is seen in the many churches in the region.

The attempted [[Invasion of Kagera|annexation of Kagera]] by Uganda in 1979 triggered the [[Uganda–Tanzania War]].

==Economy==
[[Agriculture]] is the main economic activity in the region, with the primary crops farmed in the region being [[Legume|pulses]]. [[Cereal]]s were the most often planted crop, with 153,993 hectares (42.8% of the total area planted with annuals), followed by root and tubers with 64,261 ha (17.8%), oil seeds with 10,416 ha (2.9%), cash crops with 7,737 ha (2.1%), and fruits and vegetables with 3,558 ha (1.0%). The majority of annual cash crops were cotton. Cereal crop output in the area is dominated by maize, evidenced by 302,529 households in the region raising maize during the brief wet season. This made up about 93.8% of all households that raised crops during that time.<ref name="Report2022">{{cite web| url=https://www.nbs.go.tz/nbs/takwimu/Agriculture/KAGERA%20REGION%20REPORT.pdf|title= Kagera Region Report| publisher=National Beaureu of Statistics| year=2022| access-date= 9 October 2022}}</ref>

Food crop sales accounted for 54.0% of smallholder households' total cash income in the Kagera Region, with cash crop sales (18.9%), other sporadic income (8.7%), fishing (4.3%), and wages/salaries (4.3%) following.
Petty businesses were the primary source of income for only 3.4% of smallholder households, followed by the sale of livestock (2.5%), cash remittances (2.0%), sales of forest products (0.7%), and sales of animal products (0.6%).<ref name="Report2022"/>

Kagera is also one of the largest [[coffee]] producers in the country. Muleba (9,968 ha, 26%), Karagwe (8,660 ha, 23%), Ngara (3,600 ha, 10%), Biharamulo (454 ha, 1%), and Bukoba Urban (373 ha, 1%) were the other coffee-producing areas in the area, with Bukoba Rural having the highest area (14,704 ha, 39%). (Map 3.33). However, Ngara (1.23 ha) had the greatest average amount of land planted with coffee per household, followed by Karagwe(0.32 ha), Biharamulo (0.22 ha), Muleba (0.21 ha), Bukoba Rural (0.21 ha), and Bukoba Urban (0.21 ha) (0.18 ha).<ref name="Report2022"/>

=== Wildlife and national parks ===
{{More citations needed section|find=Kagera|date=July 2022}}

The Kagera Region has abundant wildlife, including baboons, giraffe, elands, crocodiles, hippopotamus, warthog. Birdlife includes  [[African fish eagle]]s, [[hammerkop]]s, [[marabou stork]], [[cormorant]]s. [[kingfisher]]s, and [[heron]]s.

Kagera is home to [[Biharamulo Forest Reserve]], [[Burigi-Chato National Park]], [[Ibanda-Kyerwa National Park]], [[Rumanyika-Karagwe National Park]], [[Rubondo Island National Park]] and [[Saanane Island National Park]]. In 2019,  [[Burigi]], [[Biharamulo]] game reserve, and Lakes Burigi and Kimis were upgraded to become a national park with the [[Burigi-Chato National Park]]. [[Rumanyika-Karagwe National Park]] was gazetted as [[Rumanyika-Karagwe National Park]] and [[Ibanda-Kyerwa National Park]].<ref name="TNP_21b">{{cite web |title=Tanzania National Parks |url=https://www.tanzaniaparks.go.tz/uploads/publications/en-1581671752-TANAPA%20GENERAL%20BROCHURES%202020-WEBSITE%20(1).pdf |publisher=[[Tanzania National Parks Authority]] |access-date=10 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707225507/https://www.tanzaniaparks.go.tz/uploads/publications/en-1581671752-TANAPA%20GENERAL%20BROCHURES%202020-WEBSITE%20(1).pdf |archive-date=7 July 2022 |location=[[Dodoma|Dodoma, Tanzania]] |date=January 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>
