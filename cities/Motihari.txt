It is located 80 kilometres west of [[Muzaffarpur]] and 152 kilometres northwest of the state capital [[Patna]].

===Topography===
[[File:Motihari station, India, ca. 1906 (IMP-CSCNWW33-OS14-6).jpg|thumb|left|Motihari station, India, ca. 1906]]

The topography of Motihari has been described as scenic, with the "stunning beauty" (in classical terms) of Moti Jheel Lake dividing the town in two halves.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzPYdQo3vZgC&q=dhanauti+motijhil&pg=PA374 |title = Wetlands Management in North Bihar|isbn = 9788180697074|last1 = Mandal|first1 = R. B.|year = 2010}}</ref>

In Gangan Lit-Mag (Gangway Literary Magazine), Austria, wrote [[Anant Kumar]]: "The playgrounds of my childhood were the streets of Motihari. Back then that little East Indian town was not overpopulated, and the dry, clean streets of every part of town were ideal for our games: marbles, tops, badminton. And back then Motihari was a wide distance away from the big world. There were very many mango and lichee trees, fragrant lemon bushes, broad, large fields…and very few people. There were scattered decrepit hawelis and bungalows, in which frightening bhuts, geniis and juraels dwelled."<ref>http://www.gangan.com/lit-mag/36/index.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212222900/http://www.gangan.com/lit-mag/36/index.shtml |date=12 December 2016 }}</ref>

The Gandhi Sangrahalaya has a wide collection of relics and photographs of the [[Champaran Satyagraha]]. The Gandhian Memorial Pillar was designed by [[Nandalal Bose|Nand Lal Bose]], a famous artist of [[Shantiniketan]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=PTI |title=Champaran: Where mall meets Mahatma but there's reverence and remembrance too |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/champaran-where-mall-meets-mahatma-but-there-s-reverence-and-remembrance-too-119100100369_1.html |access-date=7 January 2020 |work=Business Standard India |date=1 October 2019}}</ref> The foundation stone of the pillar was laid on 10 June 1972 by the then Governor, [[D. K. Barooah|D. K. Barooch]]. It is a {{convert|48|ft|adj=on}} tall stone pillar and is situated at the same site where [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was presented in court.

*[[Azizul Haque (police officer)|Khan Bahadur Azizul Huq]], one of the two Indian police officers who worked with [[Edward Henry]] in the development of fingerprint classification, known as the [[Henry Classification System]], died in Motihari in 1933. "It was Khan Bahadur Azizul Huq who evolved a mathematical formula to supplement Henry's idea of sorting slips in 1024 pigeon holes, based on fingerprint patterns. Rai Bahadur [[Hem Chandra Bose]] made further contribution to the fingerprint science by evolving an extended system of sub classification, a telegraphic code for finger impression and a system of single-digit classification."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2000;volume=46;issue=4;spage=303;epage=8;aulast=Tewari;type=0|title=History and development of forensic science in India.|first1=R.

:Both Haque and Bose eventually received honoraria and recognition from the Government of India. At the time of final approval of the honorarium for Haque, the Home Department (Government of India) noted, "It appears from the information now received that he (Haque) was Sir Edward Henry's principal helper in perfecting the scheme and he actually himself devised the method of classification which is in universal use. He thus contributed most materially to a discovery which is of worldwide importance and has brought a great credit to the police of India."<ref>[http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102005/185.pdf Sodhi, GS, & Kaur, JK: The forgotten Indian pioneers of fingerprint science]</ref> Upon retirement from the Police service in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]], Khan Bahadur Azizul Huq settled in Motihari, and he is buried there.
*[[A.F. Salahuddin Ahmed]], [[National Professor]] of Bangladesh, a grandson of [[Azizul Haque (police officer)|Khan Bahadur Azizul Huq]] was born in Motihari in 1924. He was educated at [[Presidency University, Kolkata]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of London]], and taught at eminent universities in [[Bangladesh]]: [[Jagannath College]], [[Rajshahi University]], [[Jahangir Nagar University]], [[Dhaka University]], and [[Independent University, Bangladesh]], and wrote many books and articles in professional journals and newspapers. In one of his books, Perspectives on History, Society and Politics, he argued that despite the political divisions that took place in South Asia in 1947, the people of this vast region belong to "one indivisible civilisation which is the product of over a thousand years of historical development" and that the destinies of the people inhabiting the subcontinent are closely interlinked. They must therefore learn to live together in peace, as this is essential for their development and progress.
