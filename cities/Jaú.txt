The history of the city goes back to 1853, when a group of people decided to settle and found a [[village]]. Not until 1889, however, did it achieve the status of town. Its most widely known inhabitant is [[João Ribeiro de Barros]], the first man to travel from [[Europe]] to [[South America]] by plane, in 1927, 23 days before [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s flight.
