'''Kyiv Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Київська область|translit=Kyivska oblast}}, {{IPA|uk|ˈkɪjiu̯sʲkɐ ˈɔblɐsʲtʲ|IPA}}), also called '''Kyivshchyna''' ({{lang|uk|Київщинa}}, {{IPA|uk|ˈkɪjiu̯ʃtʃɪnɐ|IPA}}), is an [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) in central and northern [[Ukraine]]. It surrounds, but does not include, the city of [[Kyiv]], which is administered as a [[city with special status]]. However, Kyiv also serves as the [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of the oblast. The [[Kyiv metropolitan area]] extends out from Kyiv city into parts of the oblast, which is significantly dependent on the urban economy and transportation of Kyiv.

The population of Kyiv Oblast is {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,795,079|punct=.}} Its largest city is [[Bila Tserkva]], with a population over 200,000.

The [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] is in the northern part of Kyiv Oblast. It is administered separately from the oblast and public access is prohibited.

== History ==
Kyiv Oblast was created as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on February 27, 1932 among the first five original oblasts in Ukraine. It was established on territory that had been known as Ruthenian land.<ref>Tolochko, O.P. ''[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&I21DBN=EIU&P21DBN=EIU&S21STN=1&S21REF=10&S21FMT=eiu_all&C21COM=S&S21CNR=20&S21P01=0&S21P02=0&S21P03=TRN=&S21COLORTERMS=0&S21STR=Ruska_zemlia Ruthenian land (РУСЬКА ЗЕМЛЯ)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200829172705/http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&I21DBN=EIU&P21DBN=EIU&S21STN=1&S21REF=10&S21FMT=eiu_all&C21COM=S&S21CNR=20&S21P01=0&S21P02=0&S21P03=TRN=&S21COLORTERMS=0&S21STR=Ruska_zemlia |date=August 29, 2020 }}''. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine.</ref>

Earlier historical administrative units that became the territory of the oblast include the [[Kiev Voivodeship]] under the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Kiev Viceroyalty]] and [[Kiev Governorate]] under the [[Russian Empire]]. The northern part of the oblast belongs to the historical region of [[Polesia]] (''Polissia'').

In Kyiv region, there was a specific folk icon-painting style much influenced by the [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]] painting school. Saints were depicted on the deep purple or black background, their clothes dark, their haloes dark blue, dark green or even black, outlined by thin white dotted contours. The Kyiv region's icons collection is the part of the exhibition of the [[Museum of Ukrainian home icons]] in the Historical and cultural complex "[[Radomysl Castle|The Radomysl Castle]]".<ref>Богомолець. О. "Замок-музей Радомисль на Шляху Королів Via Regia". — Київ, 2013</ref>

The current borders of the oblast were set following the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986. Administrative oversight of the new city of [[Slavutych]], which was constructed as part of the [[Chernihiv Oblast]], was then transferred to the Kyiv Oblast (''see [[#Chernobyl zone|Chernobyl zone]] below'').

On 24 February 2022, [[Russian Armed Forces]] invaded Kyiv Oblast as part of its [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].<ref name="aljazeera2022/4/3/ukraine" /> Ukraine launched a counter-offensive to retake the region in March 2022.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Map of Kyivska Oblast.gif|thumb|250px|Detailed map of Kyiv Oblast, with [[raion]]s and administrative centers.]] -->

As with other oblasts of Ukraine, the head of the Kyiv Oblast State Administration (governor) is appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]] and subordinated to the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]]. Local self-government body is the popularly elected Kyiv Oblast Rada, chaired by a Speaker (elected from among the councilors).

=== The "exclaves" ===
The municipality of [[Slavutych]] is within the borders of the neighboring [[Chernihiv Oblast]] on the eastern bank of the [[Dnieper]] river and the municipality has no common border with the Kyiv Oblast. Still, Slavutych is administered by the Kyiv Oblast authorities (being a kind of administrative [[exclave]]).

Similarly, the town of [[Kotsiubynske]], which is within the borders of [[Kyiv]] city (which is surrounded by the Kyiv Oblast), is administered by the Kotsiubynske Settlement Council.

=== Chernobyl zone ===
{{Main|Chernobyl Exclusion Zone}}

The north-western end of the oblast is a part of the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] due to the [[radioactive contamination]] caused by the [[Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident]]. The largest cities within zone are [[Chernobyl (city)|Chernobyl]] and [[Prypiat, Ukraine|Prypiat]], which are now [[ghost town|abandoned]]. The city of Slavutych was built outside of the zone to host evacuated residents of Prypyat and personnel of the zone installations.
