'''Ayeyarwady Region''' ({{langx|my|ဧရာဝတီတိုင်းဒေသကြီး}} {{IPA-my|ʔèjàwədì táiɰ̃ dèθa̰ dʑí|}}, {{langx|ksw|ထံထၣ်စွ့}}, {{langx|pwo|ထံၫထၪကျိၩ့}}; formerly '''Ayeyarwady Division''' and '''Irrawaddy Division''') is a [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|region]] of [[Myanmar]], occupying the delta region of the [[Ayeyarwady River]] (Irrawaddy River). It is bordered by the [[Rakhine State]] to the northwest, the [[Bago Region]] to the north, Bago Region and [[Yangon Region]] to the east, and the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south and west.

The region lies between approximately latitude 15° 40' and 18° 30' north and between longitude 94° 15' and 96° 15' east. It has an area of {{convert|13566|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}. The estimated 2022 population is more than 6.5 million. According to the 2014 Burmese National Census the population of the Ayeyarwady Region was 6,184,829, making it the second most populous of Burma's states and regions after Yangon Region.

Ayeyarwady Region is flanked by the [[Arakan Yoma|Rakhine Yoma]] (Arakan Mountains) range in the west.  Large areas have been cleared for paddy cultivation, leading to its preeminent position as the main rice producer in the country, a position it has retained into the 21st century.

It has also a number of lakes. Of the rivers branching out from the mighty [[Ayeyarwady River|Ayeyarwady]], [[Ngawun River|Ngawun]], [[Pathein River|Pathein]] and [[Toe River|Toe]] are famous.

The capital city of Ayeyarwady division is [[Pathein]].

[[Chaungtha Beach]] and [[Ngwesaung Beach]] are popular resorts for both foreigners and the Burmese.
They are in the west of the Ayeyarwady Region, an hour from [[Pathein]] city and four hours from [[Yangon]] city by road.

== Economy ==
[[File:ChaungThaBeach.JPG|thumb|180px|Chaungtha Beach is an important tourist destination in Ayeyarwady Region.]]
Ayeyarwady Region is heavily forested and wood products are an important component of the economy. The principal crop of Ayeyarwady Region is [[rice]], and the division is called the “granary of Burma.”  In addition to rice, other crops include [[maize]], [[sesame]], [[peanut|groundnut]], [[sunflower]], [[beans]], [[pulses]], and [[jute]]. Fishery is also important; Ayeyarwady Region produces fish, [[prawn]], fish-paste, dry fish, dry prawn, and fish sauce.

Despite the importance of agriculture to the region, landlessness is high in rural households. Most farms are small; nearly half are under 5 acres. Rice paddy agriculture is dominant during the [[monsoon]] but irrigation is limited, especially in smaller farms, during the dry season. Seeds are sourced from own reserves rather than from specialized traders. Yields from farms average 3.3 tons per hectare, lower than other Asian countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Ame |last2=Belton |first2=Ben |last3=Boughton |first3=Duncan |date=August 2017 |title=Crop Production and Profitability in Ayeyarwady and Yangon |url=https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/crop-production-and-profitability-in-ayeyarwady-and-yangon |journal=Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Policy |issue=66 |access-date=January 8, 2022 |archive-date=January 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220108154154/https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/crop-production-and-profitability-in-ayeyarwady-and-yangon |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ayeyarwady Region also has considerable tourist potential. The city of [[Pathein]] has numerous historic sights and temples. Outside Pathein are the beach resorts of Chaungtha Beach and the lake resort of Inye Lake. Inye lake is located in [[Kyonpyaw]] township, {{convert|59|mi|km}} north east of Pathein. Inye lake is also well known for fishery, as the major supplier of fresh water fish. Chaungtha is located in Pathein township. However, hotel and transportation [[infrastructure]] is still very poorly developed.

== History ==
The Ayeyarwady delta region was Historically  part of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Arakan]] kingdom. This area fell under Burmese (and occasional [[Arakan|Mon]] Kingdom) rule from the 11th century AD. Its subsequent history mirrors that of the rest of lower Burma.

An ancient overland pre-[[Tang dynasty|Tang]] trade route from [[Sichuan]] (modern [[Yunnan Province]]) to [[Bengal]] passed through Ayeyarwady.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schafer |first1=Edward H. |title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of Tang Exotics |date=1963 |publisher=University of California Press |page=14 |isbn=978-0-520-05462-2}}</ref>

=== Cyclone Nargis ===
[[Image:Cyclone Nargis flooding before-and-after.jpg|thumb|Satellite photography of the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] before (top) and after (bottom) Nargis hit the area.]]
Ayeyarwady Region was the site of heavy devastation when [[Cyclone Nargis]] made landfall in early May [[2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2008]]. The [[cyclone]] made landfall on the town of Wagon near Haigyi Island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hurricanescience.org/history/storms/2000s/cyclonenargis/ |title=2008- Cyclone Nargis |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2020 |website=Hurricanes: Science and Society |publisher=The University of Rhode Island |access-date=March 5, 2022 |archive-date=March 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307215012/http://www.hurricanescience.org/history/storms/2000s/cyclonenargis/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Labutta Township]] was most heavily struck with around 80,000 deaths. The cyclone's path devastated the low-lying [[Irrawaddy Delta|delta]] regions going through south-central Ayeyarwady Region and [[Bogale]] before entering neighbouring Yangon Region. Nargis was the most expensive tropical cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean at the time, costing $12 billion in aid.<ref name="TorontoStar0519">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/427381|title=Asian bloc to handle Burma aid|date=19 May 2008|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|access-date=19 May 2008|archive-date=31 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331095752/https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2008/05/19/asian_bloc_to_handle_burma_aid.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Pathein University]] is the main university in the state, and until recently the only four-year university in the state. In recent years, the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], which closed down universities and colleges in the 1990s to quell student unrest, has "upgraded" former colleges and two-year institutes. The government now requires that students attend their local universities and colleges, such as [[Hinthada University]] and [[Maubin University]].

== Health care ==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States |date=2007-01-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427103224/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |archive-date=2011-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml | title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases | date=2007-06-28 | author=Yasmin Anwar | publisher=UC Berkeley News | access-date=2009-04-18 | archive-date=2012-07-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702123259/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml | url-status=live }}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the health care infrastructure outside of Yangon and Mandalay is extremely poor. For example, in 2003, Ayeyarwady Region had less than a quarter of hospital beds than Yangon Region although Ayeyarwady Region had a slightly greater population.<ref name=cso-hosp>{{cite web|url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |title=Hospitals and Dispensaries by State and Division |access-date=2009-04-11 |publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929022532/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |archive-date=2011-09-29 }}</ref>
