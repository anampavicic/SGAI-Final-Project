== History ==
[[File:Malkaya04.jpg|thumb|left|Malkaya is a monument with rock inscriptions that belongs to [[Hittites]] civilization.]]

{{main|Aquae Saravenae}}
The history of Kırşehir dates back to the [[Hittites]].  During the period of the Hittites, the basin of Kırşehir was known as the country of "Ahiyuva", meaning "the Land of the Achaeans", as the [[Greeks]] were known to the Hittites. This basin also took the name [[Cappadocia]] at the time of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Byzantine]]s.

Kırşehir was once known as '''Aquae Saravenae'''.<ref>{{Cite DARE|23561}}</ref> The [[Seljuks]] took the city in the 1070s and bestowed the current name. In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], "''Kır Şehri''" means "''steppe city''" or "''prairie city''". It became the chief town of a [[sanjak]] in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[vilayet of Angora]],<ref name=EB1911/> which possessed, {{circa}} 1912, 8000 inhabitants, most of them Muslim [[Turkish people|Turks]].<ref name=CathEncy/>

In the 19th century, Kırşehir was attached to the sanjak of [[Ankara]]. From 1867 until 1922, Kırşehir was part of [[Angora vilayet]]. In 1924, Kırşehir was made capital of the new [[Kırşehir Province]]. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] visited the city in 1921 and 1931.

===Kesikköprü===
[[Kesikköprü]] is one of the bridges built by the [[Seljuk Empire]] in Central [[Anatolia]]. It is on the way of Kırşehir-[[Konya]], about {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}} to the south of Kırşehir, and across the River Kızılırmak with its 13 parts. Those who came from Izmir and tried to reach Sivas and Erzurum from Tokat passed over Kesikköprü. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the bridge took the name of Kesikköprü due to the fact that caravan roads were cut off by [[Highwayman|highwaymen]].

There is an old [[Seljuks|Seljuk]] mosque built during the reign of either [[Mesud I]] or [[Kilij Arslan II]]. In the countryside is a ruined ''[[türbe]]'' (tomb) of a possible [[dervish]] during the times of either [[Seljuks]] or [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].

The inscription on the bridge says it was built by [[Atabeg]] Izzu’d-Din Muhammed in 646 of the [[Hijri year|Hijrah]]/1248 of the Christian era during the rule of [[Kaykaus II|Keykavus]], the son of [[Kaykhusraw II|Keyhüsrev]]. The inscription sunk in the river in 1953. The three-line inscription on the stone base can be read with difficulty:

===Kırşehir Castle===
Kırşehir Castle is located on a hill mound, believed to have been built in the 4th century.
It covers an area of 10 acres. It is thought to have been built by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Emperor]] [[Justinian I|Justinian]]. Nothing remains from the castle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirsehir.gov.tr/tarih-turizm|title=TARİHİ VE KÜLTÜREL DEĞERLER|access-date=2023-02-14|author=T.C.

The village of Seyfe within Kırşehir district is considered the [[Geographical centre of Earth|geographical center of Earth]], as it lies at the intersection of the [[39th parallel north]] and the [[34th meridian east]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tüfekçi |first=İhsan |date=2022-12-27 |title=Is Türkiye Center Of The World?

== Ecclesiastical history ==
=== Metropolitan Archbishopric of Mocissus ===
Mocissus was also a Christian bishopric, and became a [[metropolitan see]] when, as [[Procopius]] (De ædif., V, iv) informs us, [[Justinian]] divided Cappadocia into three provinces and made this fortified site in north-western [[Cappadocia]] metropolis of [[Cappadocia Tertia]], giving it the name of Justinianopolis.<ref name=CathEncy>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Mocissus |volume=10 |first=Sophron |last=Pétridès}}</ref> Nothing else is known of its history, and its name should perhaps be written Mocessus. There is no doubt that the site of Mocissus, or Mocessus, is that which is occupied by the modern city of Kırşehir.<ref name=CathEncy/> It figured in the ''[[Notitiæ episcopatuum]]'' until the 12th or 13th century.

Only a few of its bishops are known: the earliest, Peter, attended the [[Fifth Ecumenical Council]] (Second Council of Constantinople, 536);{{clarify|date=July 2020}} the last, whose name is not known, was a Catholic, and was consecrated after the mid-15th century Catholic [[Council of Florence]] by Patriarch [[Metrophanes II of Constantinople]].<ref name=CathEncy/>

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was restored in 1895 as a [[titular archbishopric]] of the highest (Metropolitan) rank.
It's vacant, having had the following incumbents:
* John Joseph Frederick Otto Zardetti (1895.05.25 – 1902.05.09)
* Giacomo Merizzi (1902.08.21 – 1916.03.22)
* Giovanni Battista Vinati (1916.07.31 – 1917.01.09)

* [[Lorenzo Schioppa]] (1920.08.20 – 1935.04.23)
* John Hugh MacDonald (1936.12.16 – 1938.03.05)
* Nicolas Cadi (1939.11.16 – 1941)
* Roger-Henri-Marie Beaussart (1943.12.10 – 1952.02.29)
* Vigilio Federico Dalla Zuanna, O.F.M. Cap. (1952.11.24 – 1956.03.04)
* [[Giovanni Jacono]] (1956.10.02 – 1957.05.26)
* Heinrich Wienken (1957.08.19 – 1961.01.21)
