'''Vladimir Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Влади́мирская о́бласть|Vladimirskaya oblastʹ}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which is located {{convert|190|km|sp=us}} east of [[Moscow]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], the oblast's population was&nbsp;1,443,693.<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>

The [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] includes the 12th-century cathedrals of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Suzdal]], [[Bogolyubovo, Vladimir Oblast|Bogolyubovo]], and [[Kideksha]].

==Geography==
Vladimir Oblast borders [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovo]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]], and [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]]s. The [[oblast]] is situated in the center of the [[East European Plain]]. The [[Klyazma River|Klyazma]] and the [[Oka River|Oka]] are the most important rivers. There are approximately three hundred lakes. The oblast is situated in a zone of [[mixed forests]]. The region's geology is characterized by a variety of [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[Igneous rock|igneous]] rocks, including [[sandstone]], [[shale]], [[limestone]], [[granite]], and [[diabase]]. There are also several mineral deposits in the oblast, including [[iron ore]], [[apatite]], and [[phosphate]]. Some notable natural landmarks in the oblast include the Klyazma Reservoir and the [[Suzdal Kremlin]], which is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]]. Additionally, there are several nature reserves and parks in the oblast, such as the [[Meshchyora National Park]] and the [[Ugra National Park]].<ref name="Koster">{{Cite book |last=Koster |first=Eduard A |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1222774379 |title=The physical geography of Western Europe |isbn=978-0-19-191763-9 |chapter=Chapter 8 section 3.4 |oclc=1222774379}}</ref>

===Fauna===
The oblast's [[fauna]] currently includes more than fifty species of mammals (some examples including [[Moose|elk]], [[wild boar]], [[roe deer]], [[red deer|red]] and [[sika deer]], [[lynx]], wolf, squirrel, rabbit, marten, fox, weasel, badger and other fur-bearing animals), five species of reptiles, and ten species of amphibians. The semiaquatic [[Russian desman]] is listed in the [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation|Russian Red Book of endangered species]]. The region is inhabited by 216&nbsp;species of birds, among which are the [[capercaillie]], [[black grouse]], grouse, partridge, woodcock, goose, duck, etc. The [[lesser white-fronted goose]] is listed in the Red Book.

Hunting season runs from October to February with the following license and permit restrictions:
*Elk, wild boar, red deer, and sika deer from mid-November through mid-January
*Hare from October through January
*Grouse, black grouse, woodcock, duck and goose for 10 days in April.

Bodies of water in the region are rich in numerous species (about 40) of fresh-water fish (e.g. [[eel]], [[Cyprinidae|roach]], [[Esox|pike]], [[perch]], [[bream]], [[rudd]], and [[sturgeon]] in the [[Klyazma River]]), which support [[ice fishing]] in winter. Additionally, the oblast has several hunting farms.

===Hydrography===
The total expanse of the oblast's surface waters is 32.9 hectares.

The region has hundreds of rivers with a total length of more than 8.6 million kilometers—there are 560 rivers and streams throughout the oblast. The Klyazma River flows into the [[Oka River]] on the south-eastern edge of the oblast's border with the [[Nizhny Novgorod Region]]. The Klyazma River's major tributaries in the Vladimir Region are the [[Sherna River|Sherna]] (with the [[Molokcha]] flowing into it), the [[Kirzhach River|Kirzhach]] (with its own tributaries being the Big and Small Kirzhach), the [[Peksha River|Peksha]], the [[Koloksha]], the [[Nerl River (Klyazma)|Nerl]], the [[Sudogda River|Sudogda]], the [[Uvod River|Uvod]], the [[Lukh River|Lukh]] and the [[Suvorosch]]. Tributaries of the Oka within Vladimir oblast are the [[Gus]], [[Unzha]], and [[Ushna]] rivers. The [[Dubna River (Volga basin)|Dubna River]], a tributary of the [[Volga River]], originates near the town of [[Alexandrov, Vladimir Oblast|Alexandrov]]. The Oka River is navigable throughout the region (157&nbsp;km). The rivers in the region are characterized by their flat currents, broad valleys and meandering channels. Water levels are characterized by their high spring tides, low water periods over summer-autumn with occasional flooding during heavy rains, and stable/low levels throughout the winter.

There are about three hundred lakes covering an area of five thousand hectares. Most of them are small and undrained and many are overgrown with a peat layer. The origin of the lakes varies. Numerous [[oxbow lake]]s are scattered along the river valleys. The largest of them are Lake Urvanovskoe (12&nbsp;km long) and Lake Visha (length about 10&nbsp;km). In the [[Meshchera Lowlands]] and in the northwest of the oblast are lakes of ancient [[Alluvium|alluvial valleys]]: [[Isikhry]], [[Svyatoe]] and others. Lakes of [[karst]] origin, located in the lower reaches of the Klyazma and in the center of [[Vyaznikovsky District]] (a northeastern district in the oblast), have highly mineralized water and are associated with underground watercourses. The largest and deepest of them is [[Lake Kshchara]]. In the districts of [[Alexandrovsky District, Vladimir Oblast|Alexandrov]] and [[Yuryev-Polsky District|Yuryev-Polsky]] glacial lakes are small in size.

The main masses of wetlands in the region (total area of 37.4 thousand hectares) occur in Meshchera and [[Balakhna Lowlands|Balakhna]] (in the northeast of the oblast) lowlands.

=== Climate ===
Vladimir Oblast has a humid [[continental climate]]. The region experiences a significant temperature range between day and night during the summer months, which can lead to frequent thunderstorms.

The oblast receives an average of 600-700 millimeters of precipitation annually, with most of it falling in the summer months. Snowfall is common in the winter months, with an average of 50-60 centimeters (20-24 inches) of snowfall per year.

The climate of Vladimir Oblast is influenced by its location in the center of the [[East European Plain]] and its distance from the ocean. The oblast is situated far from any major bodies of water, which means that it experiences a greater temperature range and less moderating effects from maritime air masses than regions closer to the coast. However, the region is also shielded from harsh arctic air masses by the [[Ural Mountains]], which lie to the east.<ref name="Koster" />

==History==
The territory of modern Vladimir Oblast has been populated since ancient times. The oldest known traces of human settlement date to the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. A settlement of Homo Sapiens dating back to between 32,050 BC and 28,550 BC was discovered in the area of [[Sungir]], located around 200&nbsp;km east of [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sikora |first1=Martin |last2=Seguin-Orlando |first2=Andaine |last3=Sousa |first3=Vitor C |last4=Albrechtsen |first4=Anders |last5=Korneliussen |first5=Thorfinn |last6=Ko |first6=Amy |last7=Rasmussen |first7=Simon |last8=Dupanloup |first8=Isabelle |last9=Nigst |first9=Philip R |last10=Bosch |first10=Marjolein D |last11=Renaud |first11=Gabriel |last12=Allentoft |first12=Morten E |last13=Margaryan |first13=Ashot |last14=Vasilyev |first14=Sergey V |last15=Veselovskaya |first15=Elizaveta V |year=2017 |title=Ancient genomes show social and reproductive behavior of early Upper Paleolithic foragers |journal=Science |volume=358 |issue=6363 |pages=659–662 |doi=10.1126/science.aao1807 |pmid=28982795 |doi-access=free |last16=Borutskaya |first16=Svetlana B |last17=Deviese |first17=Thibaut |last18=Comeskey |first18=Dan |last19=Higham |first19=Tom |last20=Manica |first20=Andrea |last21=Foley |first21=Robert |last22=Meltzer |first22=David J |last23=Nielsen |first23=Rasmus |last24=Excoffier |first24=Laurent |last25=Mirazon Lahr |first25=Marta |last26=Orlando |first26=Ludovic |last27=Willerslev |first27=Eske}}</ref>

The region of Vladimir were inhabited by different people like Slavs, Tatars, Finno-Ugrics and Balts. The East Slavic tribe of the [[Buzhans]] originated in the Vladimir region. Archaeological excavations of [[Volga Finns|Volga Finn]] settlements document also the Finno-Ugric roots of this land. Merya, Muromian, and Meshchera are inhabited territory of the region during this period.

Since the 10th century AD, Slavic colonization of the area began in [[Murom]] and [[Suzdal]]. The current territory of Vladimir Oblast became was part of [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]]. After the breakdown of the authority of Kievan Rus, the region became part of the Rostov-Suzdal principality in the 11th century and then the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir-Suzdal principality]] in the 12th century. The Vladimir region rapidly developed in the mid-12th century during the rule of [[Yuri Dolgorukiy]] and [[Andrey Bogolyubsky]]. New townships arose—[[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Vyazniki, Vladimir Oblast|Yaropolch-Zalessky]], [[Gorokhovets, Vladimir Oblast|Gorokhovets]], [[Starodub-on-the-Klyazma]], [[Mstislavl]]—along with princely residences in [[Kideksha]] and [[Bogolyubovo, Vladimir Oblast|Bogolyubovo]].

The [[Vladimir Highway]], a pre-modern civilian road that has been in use since at least the 14th century, traverses the region, bringing people between Moscow and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-09-29 |title=Древняя дорога – "Владимирка" |url=http://www.rustrana.ru/article.php?nid=22904 |access-date=2022-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090708/http://www.rustrana.ru/article.php?nid=22904 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>
