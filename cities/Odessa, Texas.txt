In 1948, Odessa was also the home of [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Barbara Bush]], and the onetime home of former [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]]. Former President George H. W.

==History==
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2024}}
Odessa was founded in 1881 as a water stop and cattle-shipping point on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]]. The first post office opened in 1885. Odessa became the county seat of Ector County in 1891 when the county was first organized. It was incorporated as a city in 1927, after oil was discovered in Ector County on the Connell Ranch southwest of Odessa.<ref name="Handbook">{{Cite web|first1=Bobbie Jean|last1=Klepper|title=ODESSA, TX|website=[[Handbook of Texas Online]]|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdo01|access-date=26 May 2015|date=15 June 2010|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]}}</ref>

With the opening of the Penn Field in 1929, and the Cowden Field in 1930, oil became a major draw for new residents. In 1925, the population was just 750; by 1929, it had risen to 5,000. For the rest of the 20th century, the city's population and economy grew rapidly during each of a succession of [[oil boom]]s (roughly in the 1930s–1950s, 1970s, and 2010s), often with accompanying contractions during the succeeding busts (particularly in the 1960s and 1980s).<ref name="Handbook" />

=== Etymology ===
Odessa is said to have been named after [[Odesa]], a coastal city in [[Southern Ukraine|Southern]] [[Ukraine]], (historically spelled ''Odessa'')<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stewart |first1=Ashleigh |title=Globalnews.ca |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/8645877/ukraine-correct-pronunciation/ |access-date=9 June 2023 |website=Global News |publisher=Corus Entertainment Inc.}}</ref> because of the local [[shortgrass prairie|shortgrass prairie's]] resemblance to Ukraine's [[steppe]] landscape.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ector County, Texas History |url=http://www.historictexas.net/ector/history/history.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030404/http://www.historictexas.net/ector/history/history.htm |archive-date=24 September 2015 |access-date=26 May 2015 |website=Historic Texas}}</ref>

==Geography==
Odessa is located along the southwestern edge of the [[Llano Estacado]] in [[West Texas]]. It is situated above the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], a large sedimentary deposit that contains significant reserves of oil and natural gas.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|44.0|sqmi|km2}}; {{convert|43.9|sqmi|km2}} are land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}}  (0.05%) is covered by water.

===Climate===
Odessa has a [[hot semiarid climate]] typical of West Texas. Summers are hot and sunny, while winters are cool and dry. Most rainfall occurs in late spring and summer; snowfall is rare. The area exhibits a large diurnal temperature range and frequent high winds.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Midland Texas Climate Narrative|website=[[National Weather Service]]|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/maf/?n=cli_maf_narrative|access-date=26 May 2015}}</ref>

====University of Texas Permian Basin====
The [[University of Texas Permian Basin]] (UTPB) began in 1973. UTPB was an upper level and graduate university until the Texas Legislature passed a bill in spring 1991 to allow the university to accept freshmen and sophomores. <!-- what institute? The institute provides seminars, training, and research on public leadership all over Texas, and offers a Bachelor of Arts degree in Leadership Studies. The Institute is well regarded for its Shepperd Distinguished Lecture Series, which has brought a variety of internationally-recognized individuals, such as Mikhail Gorbachev, Robert McNamara, Ralph Nader, William F. Buckley, Jr., and most recently Malcolm Gladwell, to discuss salient political and social topics.--> As of 2006, the university was holding discussions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the construction of a new High-Temperature Teaching and Test Reactor, which if successful, would finish licensing and construction around 2012. It would be the first university-based research reactor to be built in the US in roughly a decade, and be one of the few HTGR-type reactors in the world. In January 2006, UTPB's School of Business was awarded accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International, which is generally regarded as the premier accreditation agency for the world's business schools.
