==History==
The area of Kanoya was part of ancient [[Ōsumi Province]], and was part of the [[Shimazu Estate|Shimazu-shō]], a vast ''[[shōen]]'' landed manor in [[Ōsumi  Province|Ōsumi]], [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]] that was opened at the end of the [[Heian period]], and which evolved into [[Satsuma Domain]] in the [[Edo period]] . After the [[Meiji restoration]], the village of Kanoya was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Kanoya was raised to town status on December 31, 1912. On May 27, 1941 Kanoya merged with the villages of Hanaoka and Oaira to form the city of Kanoya.

In 2006, the original city of Kanoya was expanded following the merger of the two towns of [[Aira, Kagoshima (Kimotsuki District)|Aira]] and [[Kushira, Kagoshima|Kushira]] in [[Kimotsuki District, Kagoshima|Kimotsuki District]], and [[Kihoku, Kagoshima|Kihoku]] in [[Soo District, Kagoshima|Soo District]].<ref>[http://www.e-kanoya.net/htmbox/gyoukaku/2009/gappei_kensyo2009.pdf Kanoya Merger]</ref> The original Kanoya City was established as a municipality on May 27, 1941 (Navy Memorial Day).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Kanoya is home to the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]  [[Kanoya Air Field]].
