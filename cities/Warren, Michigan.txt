'''Warren''' is a city in [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. An inner-ring [[Metro Detroit|suburb of Detroit]], Warren borders [[Detroit]] to the north, roughly {{convert|13|mi|km|1}} north of [[downtown Detroit]]. The population was 139,387 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Warren_city,_Michigan?g=160XX00US2684000 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=September 30, 2024}}</ref> making Warren the largest community in Macomb County, the [[List of municipalities in Michigan|third-largest city in Michigan]], and Detroit's largest suburb.

The city is home to a wide variety of businesses, including the [[General Motors Technical Center]], the [[United States Army]] [[Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal]], home of the [[United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command]] and the [[Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center]] (TARDEC),<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Dasch |first1=Jean M. |last2=Gorsich |first2=D.J. | title=The TARDEC Story.

==History==
Beebe's Corners, the original settlement in what would become the city of Warren, was founded in 1830 at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was Charles Groesbeck.<ref name="WHC">[http://www.cityofwarren.org/index.php/historic-commission A Guide to Warren's History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120173022/http://cityofwarren.org/index.php/historic-commission |date=November 20, 2010}}, Warren Historical Commission (with assistance from the Warren Historical Society), accessed February 4, 2011</ref>  Beebe's Corners was a carriage stop between [[Detroit]] and [[Utica, Michigan|Utica]], and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post.<ref name="WHC" /><ref>"Census of Population: 1050. Vol 1: Number of Inhabitants'' (Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1052) p. 22-30''</ref>  It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct [[Warren Township, Macomb County, Michigan|Warren Township]] was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed Aba in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter.<ref name="CLHistory">[http://www.centerline.gov/history3.html City of Center Line, City History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509111633/http://www.centerline.gov/history3.html |date=May 9, 2012}}, accessed February 4, 2011</ref>  It was named for [[War of 1812]] veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev. [[Abel Warren]].  However, when it was originally organized the township was named for Rev. Warren, a [[Methodist Episcopal]] preacher who left his native [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1824 for [[Shelby Township, Michigan|Shelby Township]]. He went throughout the present-day [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]], [[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer]], [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]], and [[St. Clair County, Michigan|St. Clair]] Counties, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sF7hAAAAMAAJ Russel, John. The Funeral Discourse and Obituary of the Late Rev. Abel Warren.  Romeo, MI:  Akin & Mussey, 1863 at] [[Google books]].</ref>  He was the first licensed preacher in the State of Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macombhistory.us/1800s/abelsarahstones.html|title=Abel and Sarah Warren Pioneers|author=Wesley Arnold}}</ref>

Another version of the source of the city's name claims it was "named for General [[Joseph Warren]], who fell at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]."<ref name="Romig">{{cite book |first1=Walter |last1=Romig |title=Michigan Place Names |publisher=Walter Romig |year=1986 |page=582}}</ref>

The settlement was formally incorporated as the Village of Warren from Warren Township on April 28, 1893, out of one square mile bound by 14 Mile Road and 13 Mile Road to the north and south, and in half-a-mile east and west of Mound Road.<ref name="WHC" /> The small village grew slowly, and had a population of 582 in 1940 and 727 in 1950, while the larger surrounding township grew at a much quicker pace.<ref>1950 US Census. Vol 1. p. 22-24</ref> Much of this growth was due to the construction of the [[Warren Truck Assembly|Chrysler's Truck Assembly]] plant in 1938, the [[Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]] in 1940 to support the [[World War II|WW II]] effort, and the [[General Motors Technical Center]] between 1949 and 1956.

The Red Run and Bear Creek, just small creeks back in the 1800s, has blossomed into an open major inter-county stormdrain flowing through Warren, into the Clinton River, and onwards to Lake St. Clair.<ref>[http://www.candgnews.com/news/storm-drain-runs-through-it A storm drain runs through it], C & G News, October 26, 2011</ref>

The Village of Warren and most of the surrounding Township of Warren, together with [[Van Dyke, Michigan|Van Dyke]], incorporated as a city in 1957, less the city of [[Center Line, Michigan|Center Line]], which had incorporated as a village from Warren Township in 1925 and as a city in 1936.<ref name="CLHistory" /> Between 1950 and 1960, Warren's population soared from 42,653 to 89,426. This population explosion was largely fueled by the post-WWII [[Baby Boom]] and later, by [[white flight]] from its southern neighbor of [[Detroit]] in that decade. This change in population continued into the next decade when the city's population doubled again, ultimately reaching a high of 179,000 in 1970.

Warren was a [[sundown town]]: an all-white municipality that outlawed the presence of people of color after sunset.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} Those who violated this social order were subjected to violence.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 18, 2019 |title=City of Warren's Proposed "Rental Ban" Reeks of Racism {{!}} News |url=https://michiganchronicle.com/2019/09/18/warrens-proposed-rental-ban-reeks-of-racism/ |access-date=August 8, 2024 |website=The Michigan Chronicle |language=en-US|archive-date=July 4, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230704010457/https://michiganchronicle.com/2019/09/18/warrens-proposed-rental-ban-reeks-of-racism/}}</ref> In 1970, Warren had a population of 180,000, with only 28 minority families, most of whom lived on a U.S. military base.

====1950 to 1990 censuses====
There are a number of distinguishing characteristics about Warren which render it unique among American cities of its relative size. Warren was one of the fastest-growing municipalities in the country between 1940 and 1970, roughly doubling its population every 10 years. In 1940 the official population of Warren Township was 22,146; in 1950, it was 42,653; in 1960, after Warren Township had become the City of Warren, population had risen to 89,240; and by 1970 it had grown to 179,260.

In the late 20th century, Warren was one of the fastest-declining cities in population in the country. After peaking in 1970, the city’s population declined by 10% during each of the next two decades (1980: 161,060; 1990: 144,864), then dropped by 4.6% between 1990 and 2000.

In 1970, whites made up 99.5% of the city's total population of 179,270; only 838 non-whites lived within the city limits. In the ensuing two decades the white portion of the city dropped gradually to 98.2% in 1980 and 97.3% as of 1990.

====First Amendment lawsuit====
The City of Warren established a Christian prayer station at city hall that is operated by the Pentecostal Tabernacle Church of Warren. Douglas Marshall requested establishing a reason station.

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], and [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]] jointly filed a complaint against the city. In 2015 there was a $100,000 judgment against the city government and Mayor [[James R. Fouts]] for denying Marshall the right to establish his atheist station.<ref>Burns, Gus.
