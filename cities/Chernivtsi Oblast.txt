'''Chernivtsi Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Чернівецька область|Chernivetska oblast}}), also referred to as '''Chernivechchyna''' ({{langx|uk|Чернівеччина|label=none}}), is an [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) in western [[Ukraine]], consisting of the northern parts of the historical regions of [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]]. It has an international border with [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. The region spans {{convert|8,100|km2}}. The oblast is the smallest in Ukraine both [[List of Ukrainian oblasts and territories by area|by area]] [[List of Ukrainian oblasts and territories by population|and population.]] It has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|890,457|,}} and its administrative center is the city of [[Chernivtsi]].

In 1408, Chernivtsi was a town in [[Moldavia]] and the chief centre of the area known as Bukovina. Chernivtsi later passed to the Turks and then in 1774 to the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. After [[World War I]], it was ceded to Romania, and in 1940, the town was acquired by the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].

The oblast has a large variety of landforms: the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and picturesque hills at the foot of the mountains gradually change to a broad partly forested plain situated between the [[Dniester]] and [[Prut]] rivers.

== Geography ==
Chernivtsi Oblast covers an area of {{cvt|8,097|km2}}. It is the [[List of Ukrainian oblasts and territories by area|smallest oblast in Ukraine]], representing 1.3% of Ukrainian territory, and is only larger than the city of [[Kyiv]] itself.

In the oblast there are 75 rivers longer than 10 kilometers. The largest rivers are the [[Dniester]] (290&nbsp;km, in the Oblast), [[Prut]] (128&nbsp;km, in the Oblast) and [[Siret River|Siret]] (113&nbsp;km, in the Oblast).<ref name="ODA Geography">[http://oda.cv.ua/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1&Itemid=4&Itemid=42 About Oblast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503100557/http://oda.cv.ua/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1&Itemid=4&Itemid=42 |date=2008-05-03 }} Chernivtsi Oblast State Administration {{in lang|uk}}</ref>

The oblast covers three geographic zones: a [[forest steppe]] region between Prut and Dnister rivers, a [[foothill]] region between the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and Prut river, and a mountain region known as the [[Bukovina|Bukovinian]] part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].<ref name="ODA Geography"/>

Chernivtsi Oblast is bordered by [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]], [[Ternopil Oblast]], [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]], [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], [[Romania]], and [[Moldova]]. Within the oblast the national border of Ukraine with Romania extends 226&nbsp;km, and with Moldova {{cvt|198|km}}.<ref name="ODA Geography"/>

==History==
Chernivtsi oblast was created on August 7, 1940, in the wake of the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]]. The oblast was organized out of the northeast part of [[Ținutul Suceava]] of [[Kingdom of Romania]], joining parts of three historical regions: northern half of [[Bukovina]], northern half of the [[Hotin County]] county of [[Bessarabia]], and [[Hertsa region]], which was part of the [[Dorohoi]] county (presently [[Botoșani County]]) of proper [[Moldavia]].

Archaeological sites in the region date back to 43,000-45,000 BC, with finds including a mammoth bone dwelling from the [[Middle Paleolithic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/mterms/g/molodova.htm |title=Molodova I and V (Ukraine) |access-date=2011-12-04 |archive-date=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005437/http://archaeology.about.com/od/mterms/g/molodova.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] flourished in the area. In the Middle Ages, the region was inhabited by East Slavic tribes [[White Croats]] and [[Tivertsi]].<ref name="EUH">{{cite book|title=ЧЕРНІВЕЦЬКА ОБЛАСТЬ|url=http://www.history.org.ua/?termin=Chernivetska_oblast|author=Верменич Я.В.|work=Encyclopedia of Ukrainian History|year=2013|publisher=[[Naukova Dumka]], [[NASU Institute of History of Ukraine]]|volume=10|language=uk|isbn=978-966-00-1359-9|quote=У 9—11 ст. на території Ч.о. жили племена тиверців і хорватів.

In 1812, one half of Moldavia, since then known as [[Bessarabia]], was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]]. [[Hertsa region]] remained in Moldavia until its union with [[Wallachia]] in 1859, a union which in 1881 became the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In 1918 both provinces of [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]] united with the [[Kingdom of Romania]].

The [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] began on June 28, 1940. In addition to Bessarabia, the USSR demanded Northern Bukovina as compensation for the occupation of Bessarabia by Romania from 1918 to 1940. Hertsa region was not included in the demands that the [[Soviet Union]] addressed to Romania, but was occupied at the same time. Most of the occupied territories were organized on August 2, 1940, as the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]], while the remainder, including the Chenivtsi Oblast, which was formed on August 7, 1940, were included in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

[[File:Tschernowitz historical.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Historical regions outlined: '''red''': [[Northern Bukovina]], '''blue''': [[Hertsa region]], '''green''': [[Northern Bessarabia]]]]

Throughout 1940-1941 several tens of thousands of Bukovinians were deported to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]], some 13,000 of them on June 13, 1941, alone. This and later deportations were primarily based on social class difference, it targeted intellectuals, people employed previously by the state, businessmen, clergymen, students, railworkers. The majority of those targeted were ethnic [[Romanians]], but there were many representatives of other ethnicities, as well. The protests of the Romanian population of Bukovina that found themselves under the Soviet rule brought about serious Soviet reprisals, including of ethnic character. In the winter and spring of 1941, the Soviet troops ([[NKVD]]) opened fire on many groups of locals trying to cross the border into Romania (for more, see: [[Lunca massacre]] and [[Fântâna Albă massacre]]).

Between September 17 and November 17, 1940, by a mutual agreement between USSR and Germany, 43,641 "ethnic Germans" from the Chernivtsi region were moved to Germany, although the total ethnic German population was only 34,500, and of these some 3,500 did not go to Germany. Upon their arrival in Germany, the Nazi government sent most of non-ethnic Germans to concentration camps.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Only some of them were freed after the protests of the Romanian government.

During World War II, when the region returned under the control of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian administration]], the [[The Holocaust#Who was directly involved in the killings.3F|Jewish community of the area was largely destroyed]] by the deportations to [[ghetto]]s and [[Nazi concentration camps]], where about 60% died. Despite the anti-Semitic policies of the [[Ion Antonescu]]'s government of Romania, the mayor of [[Chernivtsi|Cernăuți]], [[Traian Popovici]], now honored by [[Israel]]'s [[Yad Vashem]] memorial as one of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]], saved approximately 20,000 Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1944, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops returned to [[Bukovina]], many inhabitants fled to [[Romania]], and Soviet persecutions resumed, with the result that the region was seriously depopulated. In demographic terms, these war-time and post-war-time factors changed the region's ethnic composition. Today the number of Jews, Germans and Poles is negligible, while the number of Romanians has decreased substantially.

[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] communities in Bukovina date back to at least 16th century. In 1775, [[Ukrainians]] ([[Ruthenians]]) represented some 8,000 out of a 75,000 population of [[Bukovina]]. By 1918, as a result of immigration of Ukrainian peasants from nearby villages in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Podolia]], there were over 200,000 Ukrainians, out of a total of 730,000. Most of Ukrainians settled in the northern parts of Bukovina. Their number was especially large in the area between the [[Dniester]] and [[Prut]] rivers, where they became a majority. A similar process occurred in Northern [[Bessarabia]]. Throughout the history of the region, there were no inter-ethnic clashes, while the city of [[Chernivtsi]] was known for its German-style architecture, for a highly cultivated society, and for ethnic tolerance. Small ethnic disputes were, however, present on occasion. In 1918, many Ukrainians in Bukovina wanted to join an independent Ukrainian state. After an initial period of free education in [[Ukrainian language]], in late 1920s Romanian authorities attempted to switch all education to the [[Romanian language]]. In 1940–1941, the Soviet reprisals were more massive in the parts of the Chernivtsi oblast were Romanians predominated; when, however, after 1944, Ukrainian anti-Soviet resistance rose up, Romanians and Ukrainians fought alongside against [[NKVD]].

Many Ukrainians in the south-western mountain area of the Chernivtsi region belong to the [[Hutsul]] ethnic sub-group, a sophisticated cultural community inhabiting an area in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in both [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]].

When the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed, Chernivtsi Oblast, then part of the Ukrainian SSR, became part of the newly independent (August 24, 1991) [[Ukraine]]. It has a Ukrainian ethnic majority. In the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|referendum]] on December 1, 1991, 92% of Chernivtsi Oblast residents supported the independence of [[Ukraine]], a wide support from both Ukrainians and Romanians.

The use of separate categories for the [[Moldovans]] and Romanians, as well as for the Moldovan and Romanian languages in the Ukrainian census has been criticized by various Romanian organizations in Ukraine, including the Romanian Community of Ukraine Interregional Union.<ref name=RDSCJ>[http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=146&document=3 Noi, NU!

According to Kateryna Sheshtakova, a professor at the Pomeranian University of Slutsk in Poland who did field research among 15 self-identified Romanians and self-identified Moldovans in the Chernivtsi region of Ukraine, 'Some Moldovans use both names of the mother tongue (Moldovan or Romanian) and accordingly declare two ethnic affiliations.'<ref>Kateryna Sheshtakova, "Ethnic Identity and Linguistic Practices of Romanians and Moldovans (On the Example of Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine), in ''Studia Humanistyczne AGH'', Tom 12/2, 2013, p. 65.</ref> Opinion polling from the Chernivtsi oblast, as well as the discussions of the delegates of the Meeting of the Leaders of the Romanophone Organizations from Ukraine of December 6, 1996, indicated that many of the self-identified Moldovans believed that the Moldovan and Romanian languages were identical.<ref>Ion Popescu and Constantin Ungureanu, ''Romanii din Ucraina - intre trecut si viitor'', vol. 1 (''Romanii din Regiunea Cernauti''), Cernauti, 2005, p. 230-231, 237-238 and passim. Popescu and Ungureanu noted that, while the leader of the Moldovans from the Odesa Oblast, Anatol Fetescu, the leader of the "Luceafarul" Society of Moldovans from Odesa, disagreed with the line that the Moldovan language should be called Romanian, the leaders of the Moldovan organizations from the Chernivtsi Oblast and five other specific oblasts agreed that the Moldovan language is, and should be called, Romanian. Previous similar congresses of the Romanian-speakers from 1992, both for the entire oblast, and by raion, from the region had unanimously supported the same position, including the president of the raion administration of the [[Novoselytsia Raion]], with a mostly Moldovan ethnic identity population, in 1992, Gheorghe Ciubrei and other leaders from the raion. See Popescu and Ungureanu, p. 237-238.</ref> Shestakova suggests that those self-identified Moldovans who see differences between Moldovan and Romanian tend to be from "the older generation".<ref>Kateryna Sheshtakova, "Ethnic Identity and Linguistic Practices of Romanians and Moldovans (On the Example of Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine), in ''Studia Humanistyczne AGH'', Tom 12/2, 2013, p. 72, second paragraph, first sentence.</ref> More information on the Romanian identity population and Moldovan identity population in Ukraine, including in the Chernivtsi oblast, and including detailed statistical data, may be found in the articles [[Romanians in Ukraine]], [[Moldovans in Ukraine]] and [[Moldovenism]].

According to the Romanian census of 1930, the territory of the future ''Chernivtsi Oblast'' had 805,642 inhabitants in that year, out of which 47.6% were [[Ukrainians]], and 28.2% were Romanians. The rest of the population was 88,772 [[Jews]], 46,946 [[Russians]] (among them an important community of [[Lipovan]]s), around 35,000 [[Germans]], 10,000 [[Polish people|Poles]], and 10,000 [[Hungarians]].<ref name=RDSCJ/>

During the inter-war period, [[Cernăuți County]] had a population of 306,975, of which 136,380 were Ukrainians, and 78,589 were [[Romanians]]. [[Storojineţ County]] had 77,382 Ukrainians and 57,595 [[Romanians]]. (The three other counties of [[Bukovina]], which remained in [[Romania]], had a total of 22,368 Ukrainians). The northern part of the [[Hotin County]] had approximately 70% Ukrainians and 25% [[Romanians]]. The Hertsa region, smaller by area and population, was virtually 100% [[Romanians|Romanian]].

Major demographic changes occurred during the [[Second World War]]. Immediate after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] takeover of the region in 1940 the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government deported or killed about 41,000 Romanians (''see [[Fântâna Albă massacre]]''), while at the same time further encouraging an influx of [[Ukrainians]] from the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Most [[Polish people|Poles]] were deported by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities, while most [[Germans]] forcibly returned to [[Germany]]. After the [[Kingdom of Romania]] took control of the region during the war (1941–1944), the [[The Holocaust#Who was directly involved in the killings?|Jewish community of the area was largely destroyed]] by the deportations to [[ghetto]]s and [[concentration camps]].

The languages of the population closely reflect the ethnic composition with over 90% within each of the major ethnic groups declaring their national language as the mother tongue.
