== Etymology ==
Some believe that the name "Palembang" is derived from the word ''limbang'' in [[Malay language|Malay]]. By adding the prefix ''pe-'' which indicates a place or situation, the city's name means "a place to pan gold and diamond ores". It is said that during antiquity, the ruler ordered gold and diamond miners to pan their ores in the city for security and surveillance reasons.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital/128745-T%2022703%20Desentralisasi%20daerah-%20Pendahuluan.pdf|title=Jati Diri yang terlupakan: Naskah-naskah Palembang|publisher=Yayasan Naskah Nusantara (Yanasa)|year=2004|editor-last=Ikram|editor-first=Achadiati|location=Jakarta|pages=2}}</ref>

Others say that the name comes from the word ''lembang'' in Malay. By adding the same prefix, the city's name means "a place where the water leaks".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital/128745-T%2022703%20Desentralisasi%20daerah-%20Pendahuluan.pdf|title=Lukisan tentang Ibukota Palembang|last=van Sevenhoven|first=J.L|publisher=Bharata|year=1971|location=Jakarta|pages=12}}</ref> It also means "a place which was constantly inundated by water". It refers to the geographical features of Palembang, which is a wetland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palembang.go.id/?nmodul=halaman&judul=sejarah&bhsnyo=id|title=Sejarah Kota Palembang}}</ref>

Some say that the name was given by four brothers who survived a shipwreck near Musi River during the [[Majapahit]] reign. It is said that on their way to a new colony in eastern Sumatra when their ship was wrecked, all belongings in the ship sunk into the sea except a broken wooden box which the survivor used as rafts. The rafts were wobbled (''limbang-limbang'') by the waves until they drifted ashore to a land which was later named ''Palimbang'' by them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital/128745-T%2022703%20Desentralisasi%20daerah-%20Pendahuluan.pdf|title=Melayu-Jawa Citra Budaya dan Sejarah Palembang|last=Hanafiah|first=Djohan|publisher=PT Raja Grafindo Persada|year=1995|location=Jakarta|pages=15}}</ref>

Palembang also has a special [[Chinese characters|Chinese character]] rendition like several cities in Indonesia. In modern Chinese, Palembang is written as ''Jùgǎng'' ({{zh|c=巨港|p=|l=giant port|s=|t=}}).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://web.budaya-tionghoa.net/index.php/item/2710-menelusuri-sejarah-dari-nama-tionghoa-kota-kota-di-indonesia|title=Menelusuri Sejarah Dari Nama Tionghoa Kota-Kota Di Indonesia|last=Eresen|first=Erik|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-gb}}</ref> {{lang|zh|巨}} here is a sound-borrowing at Hokkien. Palembang is called ''Kū-káng'' ({{lang|zh|舊港}}) in Hokkien, meaning "Old Port"; {{lang|zh|巨}} is read as ''kū'' in certain dominant dialects of Hokkien and was thus borrowed to use in place of {{lang|zh|舊}}.

{{main|History of Palembang}}

=== Srivijaya period ===
[[File:Srivijaya Archaeological Park Palembang Indonesia.svg|thumb|left|[[Srivijaya Archaeological Park]] located southwest from Palembang city centre (green). The site forms an axis connecting [[Bukit Seguntang]] and [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]].]]

The [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]], which is dated 682 AD, is the oldest inscription found in Palembang. The inscription tells of a king who acquires magical powers and leads a large military force over water and land, setting out from Tamvan delta, arriving at a place called "Matajap," and (in the interpretation of some scholars) founding the polity of Srivijaya. The "Matajap" of the inscription is believed to be Mukha Upang, a district of Palembang.<ref>{{citation|author= George Coedès | title=Les inscriptions malaises de Çrivijaya |publisher=BEFEO 1930}}</ref>

According to [[George Coedes]], "in the second half of the 9th century Java and Sumatra were united under the rule of a [[Sailendra]] reigning in Java...its centre at Palembang."<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|author-link= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

As the capital of the Srivijaya kingdom, this second oldest city in Southeast Asia has been an important trading centre in maritime Southeast Asia for more than a millennium. The kingdom flourished by controlling the international trade through the [[Strait of Malacca]] from the seventh to thirteenth century, establishing hegemony over polities in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Sanskrit inscriptions and Chinese travelogues report that the kingdom prospered as an intermediary in the international trade between China and India. Because of the [[Monsoon]], or biannual seasonal wind, after getting to Srivijaya, traders from [[China]] or [[India]] had to stay there for several months waiting the direction of the wind changes, or had to go back to China or India. Thus, Srivijaya grew to be the biggest international trade centre, and not only the market, but also infrastructures for traders such as lodging and entertainment also developed. It functioned as a cultural centre as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Le Royaume de Çrīvijaya|last = Coedès|first = George|date = 1918|journal = Bulletin de l'École Française d'Extrême-Orient|pages = 1–36|edition = 18|volume = 6|doi = 10.3406/befeo.1918.5894}}</ref> [[I-Tsing|Yijing]], a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who stayed in today's Palembang and Jambi in 671, recorded that there were more than a thousand Buddhist monks and learned scholars, sponsored by the kingdom to study religion in Palembang. He also recorded that there were many "states" under the kingdom called Srivijaya (Shili Foshi).<ref>{{Cite book|title = "Palembang: The Venice of the East," in Issues in Urban Development: Case Studies from Indonesia|last = Nas|first = Peter J.

In 990, an army from the [[Mataram Kingdom|Kingdom of Mataram]] in Java attacked Srivijaya. Palembang was sacked and the palace was looted. [[Cudamani Warmadewa]], however, requested protection from China. By 1006, the invasion was finally repelled. In retaliation, Srivijaya king sent his troops to assist King Wurawari of Luaram in his revolt against Mataram. In subsequent battles, Mataram Palace was destroyed and the royal family of Mataram executed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Munoz|title=Early Kingdoms |page=151}}</ref>

In 1068, King [[Virarajendra Chola]] of the [[Chola Dynasty]] of India conquered what is now Kedah from Srivijaya.<ref>The Cambridge Economic History of India: c.1200-c.1750 herausgegeben by [[Tapan Raychaudhuri]], Irfan Habib, Dharma Kumar p.40</ref> Having lost many soldiers in the war and with its coffers almost empty due to the twenty-year disruption of trade, the reach of Srivijaya was diminished.

In 1407, Chen was [[Battle of Palembang (1407)|confronted at Palembang by the returning imperial treasure fleet]] under Admiral [[Zheng He]]. Zheng made the opening gambit, demanding Chen's surrender and the pirate quickly signalled agreement while preparing for a surprise pre-emptive strike. But details of his plan had been provided to Zheng by a local Chinese informant, and in the fierce battle that ensued, the Ming soldiers and Ming superior armada finally destroyed the pirate fleet and killed 5,000 of its men. Chen was captured and held for public execution in [[Nanjing]] in 1407. Peace was finally restored to the Strait of Malacca as [[Shi Jinqing]] was installed as Palembang's new ruler and incorporated into what would become a far-flung system of allies who acknowledged Ming supremacy in return for diplomatic recognition, military protection, and trading rights.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia|last = Ta Sen|first = Tan|publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year = 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2005/07/china-armada/viviano-text/5|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610222514/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2005/07/china-armada/viviano-text/5|url-status = dead|archive-date = 10 June 2015|title = China's Great Armada – National Geographic Magazine|date = 15 May 2012|access-date = 22 July 2012|publisher = National Geographic}}</ref>

=== Palembang Sultanate ===
[[File:Bird's eye view of Palembang.JPG|thumb|left|The walled city of Palembang with its three fortresses in 1682]]

After the [[Demak Sultanate]] fell under [[Kingdom of Pajang]], a Demak nobleman, [[Geding Suro]] with his followers fled to Palembang and established a new dynasty. It is from this period, that [[Islam]] became the dominant religion in Palembang.<ref name=":1"/> The [[Sultanate of Palembang]] was proclaimed in 1659.

Several local rivals, such as [[Banten Sultanate|Banten]], [[Jambi Sultanate|Jambi]], and [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]] threatened the existence of the Sultanate. The [[Dutch East India Company]] established a trade post in Palembang in 1619. In 1642, the company obtained monopoly over the ports pepper trade. Tensions mounted between the Dutch and locals, peaking in 1657 when a Dutch ship was attacked in Palembang. This provided opportunity for the company to launch a punitive expedition in 1659, in which the city was burnt to the ground.<ref name=":1"/>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1812, Sultan [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]] repudiated British claims to suzerainty. The British responded by mounting a military expedition that captured Palembang and deposed the sultan. His younger brother, the pro-British Najamudinn, was installed onto the throne instead. The Dutch colonial government attempted to recover their influence at the court in 1816, but Sultan Najamuddin was uncooperative. An expedition launched by the Dutch in 1818 captured Sultan Najamudin and he was exiled to Batavia. A Dutch Army garrison was established in 1821, but Najamuddin attempted an attack and a mass poisoning of the garrison, which was intervened by the Dutch. Mahmud Badaruddin II was exiled to [[Ternate]], and his palace was burned to the ground. The Sultanate was later abolished by the Dutch and direct colonial rule was established.<ref name=":1" />

Following the Dutch abolition of the Palembang Sultanate in 1825, Palembang became the capital of the Residency of Palembang, encompassing the territory that would become the [[South Sumatra]] province after Indonesian independence. Its first resident was [[Jan Izaäk van Sevenhoven]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last1=Panji|first1=Kemas A.

From the late nineteenth century, with the Dutch introduction of new export crops including [[robusta coffee]], Palembang rose as an economic centre. During the early 20th century, the development of the petroleum and rubber industries in Palembang Residency drove the city's economic growth. This saw a growth in migrants, an increase in [[urbanisation]], and development of the socioeconomic infrastructure. Palembang became the most populous urban centre outside Java.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title = Palembang in the 1950s: The Making and Unmaking of a Region|last = Yeo|first = Woonkyung|publisher = University of Washington|year = 2012}}</ref>

=== Japanese occupation ===
[[File:IJA Paratroopers Teishin Shudan in Palembang Feb 1942.png|thumb|Imperial Japanese Army paratroopers landing during the battle of Palembang, 13 February 1942]]
{{see also|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies}}
An oil embargo had been imposed on Japan by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and due to its oil refineries, Palembang was a high priority objective for Japanese forces. With the area's fuel supply and airfield, Palembang offered potential as a military base area, to both the Allies and the Japanese.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|title = The Battle for Palembang|url = http://warfare.gq/dutcheastindies/palembang.html|website = Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942|access-date = 2 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{cite web|title = The Japanese Invasion of Sumatra Island|url = http://warfare.gq/dutcheastindies/fall_sumatra.html|website = Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942|access-date = 2 January 2016|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203032143/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/fall_sumatra.html|archive-date = 3 December 2012|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

The main battle occurred during 13–16 February 1942. While the Allied planes were attacking Japanese shipping on 13 February, Kawasaki Ki-56 transport planes of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ''Chutai'', Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF), dropped [[Teishin Shudan]] (Raiding Group) paratroopers over Pangkalan Benteng airfield. At the same time Mitsubishi Ki-21 bombers from the 98th ''Sentai'' dropped supplies for paratroopers. The formation was escorted by a large force of Nakajima Ki-43 fighters from the 59th and 64th ''Sentai''. As many as 180 men from the Japanese 2nd Parachute Regiment, under Colonel Seiichi Kume, dropped between Palembang and Pangkalan Benteng, and more than 90 men came down west of the refineries at Plaju.

Although the Japanese paratroopers failed to capture the Pangkalan Benteng airfield, they managed to gain undamaged possession of the Plaju oil refinery. However, the second oil refinery in Sungai Gerong was demolished by the Allies. A counter-attack by ''Landstorm'' troops and anti-aircraft gunners from Prabumulih managed to retake the complex but took heavy losses. The planned demolition failed to do any serious damage to the refinery, but the oil stores were set ablaze. Two hours after the first drop, another 60 Japanese paratroopers were dropped near Pangkalan Benteng airfield.<ref name=":3"/><ref name=":4"/>

As the Japanese landing force approached Sumatra, the remaining Allied aircraft attacked it, and the Japanese transport ship ''Otawa Maru'' was sunk. Hurricanes flew up the rivers, machine-gunning Japanese landing craft. However, on the afternoon of 15 February, all Allied aircraft were ordered to Java, where a major Japanese attack was anticipated, and the Allied air units had withdrawn from southern Sumatra by the evening of 16 February 1942. Other personnel were evacuated via Oosthaven (now Bandar Lampung) by ships to Java or India.<ref name=":3"/><ref name=":4"/>

The Japanese managed to restore production at both main refineries, and these petroleum products were significant in their war effort. Despite Allied air raids, production was largely maintained. The city was defended from air attacks by the Imperial Japanese Army's [[Palembang Defense Unit]].

In August 1944, USAAF B-29 bombers flying from India, [[Operation Boomerang|raided the Palembang refineries]] in what was the longest range regular bombing mission of the war.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rickard|first1=J|title=Boeing B-29 Superfortress Combat Record|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_B-29_combat.html|website=History of War|access-date=22 August 2017|date=10 December 2007}}</ref>

In January 1945, in [[Operation Meridian I and II]], the British Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] launched two major attacks on the two refinery complexes, against determined Japanese defence.<ref>Iredale, W.

=== National revolution ===
{{see also|Indonesian National Revolution}}

On 8 October 1945, the Resident of South Sumatra, Adnan Kapau Gani, and ''Gunseibu'' officers raised the Indonesian flag during a ceremony. It was declared that Palembang Residency was under control of Republicans.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman Jepang dan zaman Republik Indonesia, ±1942–1998|last = Notosusanto|first = Nugroho|publisher = Balai Pustaka|year = 2008}}</ref>

Palembang was occupied by the Dutch after an urban battle with Republicans on 1–5 January 1947, which is nicknamed ''Pertempuran Lima Hari Lima Malam'' (Five Days and Nights Battle). The battle ended with a ceasefire and the Republican forces retreated as far as {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} from Palembang.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Sejarah Indonesia V|last1 = Notosusanto|first1 = Nugroho|publisher = Balai Pustaka|year = 1987|last2 = Poesponegoro|first2 = Marwatidjoened}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Sedjarah Perdjuangan Indonesia|last = Dimjati|first = M|publisher = Widjaja|year = 1951|location = Djakarta}}</ref>

=== Old Order and New Order period ===
During [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia|PRRI]]/[[Permesta]] rebellion, the rebel faction established ''Dewan Garuda'' (Garuda Council) in South Sumatra on 15 January 1957 under Lieutenant Colonel Barlian took over the local government of South Sumatra.

In April 1962, Indonesian government started the construction of Ampera Bridge which was completed and officially opened for public on 30 September 1965 by Minister/Commander of the Army Lieutenant General [[Ahmad Yani]] on 30 September 1965, only hours before he was killed by troops belonging to the [[30 September Movement]]. At first, the bridge was known as the Bung Karno Bridge, after the president, but following his fall, it was renamed the Ampera Bridge.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Wiratman: Momentum & Innovation 1960–2010|last = Imelda Akmal (Ed)|publisher = Mitrawira Aneka Guna|year = 2010|isbn = 978-602-97997-0-5|location = Jakarta}}</ref> A second bridge in Palembang which crosses Musi River, Musi II Bridge was built on 4 August 1992.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|title = Kerusuhan Di Kota Palembang Pada Bulan Mei Tahun 1998 dan Dampaknya Terhadap Masyarakat Kota Palembang di Bidang Politik, Ekonomi dan Sosial (1998–2003)|last = Winda|first = Heny|date = 23 October 2012|journal = UNSRI}}</ref>

On 6 December 1988, Indonesia government expanded Palembang's administrative area as far as 12 kilometers from the city center, with 9 villages from [[Musi Banyuasin]] integrated into 2 new districts of Palembang and 1 village from [[Ogan Komering Ilir Regency|Ogan Komering Ilir]] integrated into Seberang Ulu I District.<ref name=":5"/>

During [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia]], Palembang was also ravaged by riots with 10 burned shops, more than a dozen burned cars, and several injured people inflicted by rioters as students marching to the Provincial People's Representative Council office of South Sumatra. Thousands of police and soldiers were put on guard at various points in the city. The Volunteer Team for Humanity (Indonesian: ''Tim Relawan untuk Manusia'', or TRUK) reported that cases of sexual assault also took place.<ref name=":5"/>

Palembang is also located on the confluence of two major tributaries of Musi River, which are [[Ogan River]] and [[Komering River]]. The river's water level is influenced by [[Tide|tidal cycle]].

Palembang is located in the [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af'') zone with significant rainfall even in its driest months. The climate in Palembang is often described as a "hot, humid climate with a lot of rainfall throughout the year". The annual average temperature is around {{convert|27.3|°C|1}}. Within this tropical climate, except for precipitation and [[Monsoon|monsoonal wind]] direction, the city experiences no other seasonal change throughout the year.

Palembang is roughly divided by Musi River into two major areas known as Seberang Ilir (lit. "downstream bank") in the north and Seberang Ulu (lit. "upstream bank") in the south. Seberang Ilir is the main economic and political centre in Palembang and contained a prominent portion of the city's highrises. Seberang Ulu is undergoing massive development, especially in Jakabaring, with the construction of business centre, government building, and the most notably is the construction of the city's sport complex, [[Jakabaring Sport City]].

== Administration ==

=== Government ===
Palembang administratively has a status as a [[city]] and has its own local government and legislative body. The executive head of Palembang is the Mayor. The mayor and members of representatives are locally elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The city government enjoys greater decentralization of affairs than the provincial body, such as the provision of public schools, public health facilities and public transportation. Current Mayor of the city is [[Harnojoyo]], previous vice mayor who is appointed because the previous mayor, [[Romi Herton]] was impeached because of a bribery scandal during his election.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2015/02/12/22015251/Suap.Akil.Mochtar.Wali.Kota.Palembang.dan.Istrinya.Dituntut.9.dan.6.Tahun.Penjara|title=Suap Akil Mochtar, Wali Kota Palembang dan Istrinya Dituntut 9 dan 6 Tahun Penjara - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}</ref> Besides Mayor and Vice Mayor, there is the [[Palembang City Regional House of Representatives]], which is a legislative body of 50 council members directly elected by the people in legislative elections every five years.<ref>{{cite web |title=DPRD Kota Palembang |url=https://dprdkota.palembang.go.id/home.php |access-date=25 October 2023 |language=id}}</ref>

Before the operation of Ampera Bridge, there were more people in Palembang using water transportation. Large water vehicles such as [[river steamboat]] was used to transport people to and from inland. Some people also used smaller boats such as the Kajang boat, a traditional boat with simple roof to carry people and goods. Nowadays, people in Palembang prefer road transportation over water, and private transportation over public. Traffic jams often occur in some main streets, especially during [[rush hour]]. Rail and air transportation are also available in Palembang.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Selasa |first=Samuji |date=24 March 2014 |title=Melirik Transportasi Palembang Dari Masa ke Masa |language=en-US |work=Terminal Lemabang |url=https://terminallemabang.wordpress.com/2014/03/24/melirik-transportasi-palembang-dari-masa-ke-masa/ |access-date=2017-12-10}}</ref>

==== Public Bus and Taxibus ====
Palembang operates several bus and taxibus (''angkot'') routes. The first angkots in Palembang were using Willys Jeep and was called "Mobil Ketek" because of its engine sound. Public buses were introduced in the 1990s and served some routes from Seberang Ilir neighborhoods such as Km.12, Perumnas, Pusri, and Bukit Besar to Seberang Ulu neighborhoods which are Kertapati, Plaju, and Jakabaring. Due to aging vehicles, poor security and drivers habit, all non air-conditioned public buses are ordered to cease their services inside Palembang in 2018.

Currently, much of public bus services in Palembang is provided by Teman Bus since 2020 since previous public bus service operator in Palembang named ''Transmusi'' which had been introduced in 2010 stop its service.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Agustin |first=Feny Maulia |title=TransMusi Palembang Setop Beroperasi dan Diganti Teman Bus |url=https://sumsel.idntimes.com/news/sumsel/feny-agustin/transmusi-palembang-setop-beroperasi-dan-diganti-teman-bus |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=IDN Times |language=id}}</ref> Teman Bus is running four routes (corridors) inside the city.

==== App-based taxi and ''ojek'' ====
Taxis and ''ojeks'' are available via [[Go-Jek]] and [[Grab (company)|Grab]]. Because of protests from taxi drivers, ''angkot'' and ''ojek'' are often barred from taking passengers to/from some places, such as the airport.

''Perahu ketek'' is often used especially by people who live on riverside to cross the river from one bank to another. Another type of river transportation is called "speedboat", a wooden motorboat which using more larger engine and designed to withstand the speed of the boat itself, far more faster than ''perahu ketek''. Speedboats often used by the people outside Palembang, especially who lives in Musi River delta, to go to and from Palembang. Palembang also operates some larger riverboat for tourism activities.
