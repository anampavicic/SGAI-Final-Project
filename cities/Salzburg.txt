The town is on the site of the Roman settlement of ''Iuvavum''. Salzburg was founded as an [[episcopal see]] in 696 and became a [[Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg|seat of the archbishop]] in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction, trade, as well as gold mining. The [[Hohensalzburg Fortress|fortress of Hohensalzburg]], one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a center of the [[Counter-Reformation]], with monasteries and numerous Baroque churches built.

[[Historic Centre of the City of Salzburg|Salzburg's historic center]] ({{langx|de|Altstadt}}) is renowned for its [[Baroque architecture]] and is one of the best-preserved city centers north of the Alps. The historic center was enlisted as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.unesco.at/kultur/welterbe/unesco-welterbe-in-oesterreich/historisches-zentrum-der-stadt-salzburg |title=Historisches Zentrum der Stadt Salzburg |access-date=10 July 2021 |archive-date=14 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614015952/https://www.unesco.at/kultur/welterbe/unesco-welterbe-in-oesterreich/historisches-zentrum-der-stadt-salzburg |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has three universities and a large population of students.

== Etymology ==
The name "Salzburg" was first recorded in the late 8th century.{{Efn|Spelled "Salzpurch" in the earliest ''vita'' of [[Saint Boniface]]}} It is composed of two parts; the first being "{{lang|de|Salz-}}" German for "salt" and the second being "-burg" from [[West Germanic languages|Proto-West-Germanic]]: ''*burg'' conveying the same meaning as {{Langx|la|oppidum|lit=fortified settlement, city}} and not that of the [[New High German]]: {{lang|de|Burg}}, [[Literal translation|<small>lit.</small>]] 'fortress'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hörburger |first=Franz |title=Salzburger Ortsnamenbuch |publisher=Gesellschaft für Salzburger Landeskunde |year=1982 |editor-last=Reiffenstein |editor-first=Ingo |edition=Ingo |location=Salzburg |pages=32, 55 |language=de |trans-title=Toponyms of Salzburg |editor-last2=Ziller |editor-first2=Leopold}}</ref>

==History==
{{for timeline}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:2163 - Salzburg - Stift Nonnberg.JPG|thumb|In the 8th century the Benedictine monastery of Nonnberg was founded for Erentrudis, who was later canonized.]]
The area of the city has been inhabited continuously since the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]] until the present. In the [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period it was an administrative centre of the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Alums]] in the Kingdom of [[Noricum]].

After the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion in 15 BC, the various settlements on the Salzburg hills were abandoned, following the construction of the Roman city in the area of the old town. The recently created ''Municipium Claudium Juvavum'' was awarded the status of a Roman ''[[municipium]]'' in {{CE|45}} and has become one of the most important cities of the now [[Roman province]] of [[Noricum#Roman rule|Noricum]].

=== Middle Ages ===
When the province of Noricum collapsed in 488 at the beginning of the [[migration period]], part of the Romano-Celtic population remained in the country. In the 6th century they came under the rule of the [[Baiuvarii]]. The ''Life of [[Rupert of Salzburg|Saint Rupert]]'' credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth, when around {{CE|696}}, Bishop [[Rupert of Salzburg]] received the remains of the Roman town from [[Theodo of Bavaria|Duke Theodo II of Bavaria]] as well as a ''castrum superius'' (upper castle) on the Nonnberg Terrace as a gift.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Rupert, St |volume= 23 |last= Delehaye |first= Hippolyte |author-link= Hippolyte Delehaye | page = 856 |short= 1 }}</ref> In return he was to [[evangelize]] the east and south-east of the country of Bavaria.

Rupert reconnoitred the river for the site of his [[basilica]] and chose Juvavum. He ordained priests and annexed the manor of [[Piding]]. Rupert built a church at [[St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg|St. Peter]] on the site of today's cathedral and probably also founded the associated monastery and the Benedictine nunnery on Nonnberg for his relative [[Erentrude]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=St. Erentrude, Virgin, of Austria|url=http://ww1.antiochian.org/content/st-erentrude-virgin-austria|publisher=Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|location=Englewood, New Jersey|access-date=19 August 2023|archive-date=19 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230819223733/http://ww1.antiochian.org/content/st-erentrude-virgin-austria|url-status=dead}}</ref> Salzburg has been the seat of a [[diocesan bishop]] since {{CE|739}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Chronology of Catholic Dioceses: Austria |url=http://www.katolsk.no/organisasjon/verden/chronology/austria |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo]] |location=Norway |access-date=19 August 2023 |archive-date=19 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230819223735/http://www.katolsk.no/organisasjon/verden/chronology/austria |url-status=live }}</ref> and an [[archbishopric]] since {{CE|798}}. The first cathedral was built under Archbishop Virgil. The [[Franciscan Church, Salzburg|Franciscan Church]] existed since the beginning of the 9th century at the latest.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Bernd|last1=Euler|first2=Ronald|last2=Gobiet|first3=Horst R.|last3=Huber|first4=Roswitha|last4=Juffinger|title=Dehio Salzburg. Stadt und Land |publisher=Verlag Anton Schroll & Co |place=Vienna |date=1986 |page=516}}</ref> The Marienkirche dates from 1139.

[[File:Festung Hohensalzburg von Nordost.jpg|thumb|The Romanesque Palace, Hohensalzburg Fortress, with a ring wall enclosing the hilltop, built on the site of a Roman fort.]]
The first use of the German name Salzburg, meaning ''Salt-Castle'', can be traced back to {{CE|739}} when the name was used in [[Willibald]]'s report on the organization of the Bavarian dioceses by [[Saint Boniface]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/MGSL_130_0193-0200.pdf |title=Der Name Salzburgs Entstehung und Frühgeschichte |author=Ingo Reiffenstein |date=1990 |access-date=17 April 2023}}</ref> The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River [[Salzach]], which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. [[Hohensalzburg Fortress]], the city's [[fortification|fortress]] was built on the site of a Roman fort<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.salzburgmuseum.at/en/locations/fortress-museum/ |title=Salzburg Museum: Fortress Museum: Hohensalzburg Fortress |access-date=17 April 2023}}</ref> in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence.{{sfn|de Fabianis|2013|p=167}} It was greatly expanded during the following centuries. This site is not the site of the Roman ''castrum superius'', which was located on the Nonnberg nearby.

The state of Salzburg and its counties soon gained more and more influence and power within Bavaria due to the flourishing [[salt mining]] and the wide-ranging missionary activities.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Heinz Dopsch|author2=Hans Spatzenegger|title=Geschichte Salzburgs|volume=I/1 |place=Salzburg|publisher=Universitäts-Verlag Pustet|date=1984 |isbn=3-7025-0197-5 |pages=437–462 |language=de}}</ref> In 996 [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]] rented Archbishop Hartwig the [[Market town|market rights]] and [[minting rights]] (probably also the toll law). The first part of Hohensalzburg Fortress was built in 1077. A city judge was first mentioned in a document in 1120/30. On the left bank of the Salzach an extensive spiritual district was created with the cathedral, the bishop's residence north-west of the cathedral, the cathedral monastery on its south side, St Peter's monastery and the Frauengarten (probably after a former women's convent that was dissolved in 1583). Only during the 12th century did the civil settlement begin to spread into the Getreidegasse, the Abtsgasse (Sigmund Haffner-Gasse) and along the quay. Around 1280 the first city fortifications were created.{{sfn|Euler|Gobiet|Huber|Juffinger|1986|pages=516f}} The oldest known city law document dates from the year 1287.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Peter Kramml|display-authors=etal|title=Stadt Salzburg, Geschichte in Bildern und Dokumenten |place=Salzburg|publisher=Municipality of Salzburg|date=2002 |isbn=3-901014-76-4 |pages=12–14}}</ref>

===Under the prince-bishopric's rule===
{{Main|Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg}}
Independence from [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]] was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], a [[prince-bishop]]ric of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the [[German Peasants' War]], and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress.{{sfn|de Fabianis|2013|p=167}} It was besieged for three months in 1525.

Eventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops [[Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau]], [[Mark Sittich von Hohenems (Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg)|Markus Sittikus]], and [[Paris Lodron]]. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city center as it is today along with many palaces.<ref>Visit Salzburg, [http://www.visit-salzburg.net/history.htm Salzburg's History: Coming a long Way] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221111174103/https://www.visit-salzburg.net/history.htm |date=11 November 2022 }}.</ref>

===Modern era===

====Religious conflict====
{{main|Salzburg Protestants}}

On 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of [[The Ninety-Five Theses|the 95 Theses]], [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop]] Count [[Leopold Anton von Firmian]] signed an Edict of Expulsion, the ''Emigrationspatent'', directing all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia.<ref name="Perry">Frank L. Perry Jr., [http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=561 Catholics Cleanse Salzburg of Protestants] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083449/http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=561 |date=4 March 2016 }}, The Georgia Salzburger Society.</ref> The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.

====Illuminism====
In 1772–1803, under archbishop [[Hieronymus von Colloredo|Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo]], Salzburg was a center of late [[Age of Enlightenment|Illuminism]]. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. Colloredo often had arguments with Mozart and he dismissed him by saying, {{lang|de|Soll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn nicht!}} (He should go; I don't need him!). Mozart left Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family, although his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] stayed back, as he had a close relationship with Colloredo.

===Electorate of Salzburg===
In 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor [[Napoleon]]; he transferred the territory to [[Ferdinand&nbsp;III of Tuscany|Ferdinando III of Tuscany]], former Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], as the [[Electorate of Salzburg]].

===Austrian and Bavarian rule===
In 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the [[Austrian Empire]], along with the [[Berchtesgaden Provostry]]. In 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] after Austria's defeat at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] with the [[Treaty of Munich (1816)]], Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with [[Bavaria]]. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from [[Linz]].<ref>''Times Atlas of European History'', 3rd ed., 2002</ref>

In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the [[Duchy of Salzburg]], a [[crown land#Austria|crownland]] of the [[Austrian Empire]]. The city became part of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the [[Romantic Era]] led to increased tourism. In 1892, a [[funicular]] was installed to facilitate tourism to [[Hohensalzburg Fortress]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=de Fabianis|editor-first=Valeria|title=Castles of the World|publisher=Metro Books|date=2013|page=168|isbn=978-1-4351-4845-1}}</ref>
[[File:Salzburg vom Mönchsberg aus.jpg|thumb|Salzburg in 1914; [[Salzburg Cathedral|cathedral]] on the left, [[Hohensalzburg Fortress]] in the background]]

===20th century===

====First Republic====
Following [[World War&nbsp;I]] and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] territories, became part of the new [[German Austria]]. In 1918, it represented the residual [[German speaking world|German-speaking]] territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the [[First Austrian Republic]] in 1919, after the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]].

====Annexation by Nazi Germany====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-119-04A, Anschluss Österreich.jpg|upright|thumb|Young Austrians at celebrations just after the [[Anschluss]], March 1938]]
The [[Anschluss]] (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into [[Nazi Germany]]) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled [[referendum]] on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, [[history of the Jews in Austria|Jewish citizens]] and [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany#Germanization between 1939 and 1945|other minorities]] were subsequently arrested and [[The Holocaust|deported]] to concentration camps. The [[synagogue]] was destroyed.

====World War II====
After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|POW camps]] for prisoners from the [[Soviet Union]] and other enemy nations were arranged in the city.

During the Nazi occupation, a [[Romani people|Romani]] camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labor to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Konzentrationslager%2C_KZ |title=AEIOU Österreich-Lexikon – Konzentrationslager, KZ |publisher=Austria-Forum.org |access-date=24 June 2013}}</ref>

Salzburg was also the location of five subcamps of the [[Dachau concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|year=2009|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945. Volume I|publisher=Indiana University Press, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|pages=538–539|isbn=978-0-253-35328-3}}</ref>

[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the [[Salzburger Dom|cathedral]] were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. [[List of major U.S. Commands of World War II|American troops]] entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the [[Allied-occupied Austria|American-occupied area in Austria]]. Several [[displaced persons camp]]s were established in Salzburg{{mdash}}among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp Mülln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.

====Today====
After World War&nbsp;II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal [[State of Salzburg]] (''Land Salzburg'') and saw the Americans leave the area once Austria had signed a [[Austrian State Treaty|1955 treaty re-establishing the country as a democratic and independent nation]] and subsequently [[Declaration of Neutrality|declared its perpetual neutrality]]. In the 1960s, the city became the shooting location and setting of the family musical film ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00&nbsp;p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.

As of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of €46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and most European countries.<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news |author=E.B. |title=The Salzburg Festival is a boon to the local economy |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/09/hills-and-tills-are-alive |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=26 September 2017}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Salzburg - Panoramaansicht.JPG|thumb|Eastern view of the Salzburg Basin with the city of Salzburg in the centre]]
Salzburg is on the banks of the River [[Salzach]], at the northern boundary of the [[Alps]]. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972‑metre-high [[Untersberg]], is less than {{cvt|16|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city center. The ''Altstadt'', or "old town", is dominated by its [[baroque]] towers and churches and the massive [[Hohensalzburg Fortress]]. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the [[Mönchsberg]] and [[Kapuzinerberg]], which offer green relief within the city. Salzburg is approximately {{cvt|150|km|0}} east of [[Munich]], {{cvt|281|km|0}} northwest of [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], and {{cvt|300|km|0}} west of [[Vienna]]. Salzburg has about the same latitude as [[Seattle]].

Due to its proximity to the Austrian-German border, the greater Salzburg urban area has sometimes (unoffcially) been thought of as if it included contiguous parts of Germany: [[Freilassing]] (until 1923 known as Salzburghofen), [[Ainring]] and [[Piding]]. Public transport planning and multiple public transport lines stretch across the border. 

===Climate===
The [[Köppen climate classification]] specifies Salzburg's climate as a [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] climate (Dfb). However, with the {{cvt|-3|C|F}} isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having a four-season [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb) with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific [[drizzle]] is called ''Schnürlregen'' in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced [[foehn wind]]s regularly occur.

Salzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent [[municipalities]]. After [[World War&nbsp;II]], numerous [[refugees]] found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation and could be used for [[refugee]]s when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150000 citizens.

=== Migrant communities ===
Salzburg is home to large German, Bosnian, Serbian, and Romanian communities.

[[File:View of Salzburg from Fortress Hohensalzburg.jpg|thumb|View from Hohensalzburg Fortress]]

===Romanesque and Gothic===
The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Church (building)|churches]], the [[Monastery|monasteries]] and the early carcass houses dominated the [[medieval]] city for a long time. The Cathedral of [[Archbishop]] [[Conrad of Wittelsbach]] was the largest [[basilica]] north of the [[Alps]]. The choir of the [[Franciscan Church, Salzburg|Franciscan Church]], construction was begun by [[Hans von Burghausen]] and completed by [[mw:de:Stephan Krumenauer|Stephan Krumenauer]], is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era [[Nonnberg Abbey]], the Margaret Chapel in [[St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg|St Peter's Abbey]], St George's Chapel, and the stately halls of the "Hoher Stock" in [[Hohensalzburg Fortress]] were constructed.

===Renaissance and baroque===
Inspired by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], Prince-Archbishop [[Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau]] began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late [[Renaissance]]. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by [[Santino Solari]] rose as the first early [[Baroque]] church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. [[mw:de:Markus Sittikus von Hohenems (Salzburg)|Markus Sittikus]] and [[mw:de:Paris von Lodron|Paris von Lodron]] continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as [[Hellbrunn Palace]], the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni [[mw:de:Gaspare Zuccalli|Gaspare Zuccalli]], by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.

After the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the [[Rococo]] style. [[Sigismund von Schrattenbach]] continued with the construction of "Sigmundstor" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former "Fürsterzbistum Salzburg" (Archbishopric) to [[Upper Austria]], [[Bavaria]] (Rupertigau) and [[Tyrol (region)|Tyrol]] (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (''[[Gründerzeit]]'') brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty [[mw:de:Jakob Ceconi|Jakob Ceconi]] and [[mw:de:Carl Freiherr von Schwarz|Carl Freiherr von Schwarz]] filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visit-salzburg.net/travel/architecture.htm |title=Architecture : Salzburg Sights by Period |publisher=Visit-salzburg.net |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

===Classical modernism and post-war modernism===

Buildings of classical [[Modern architecture|modernism]] and in particular, post-war modernism is frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse&nbsp;22 in the right center of the old town), the "Lepi" (public baths in ''Leopoldskron'') (built 1964), and the original 1957 constructed congress-center of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of the architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the [[Großes Festspielhaus]] by [[Clemens Holzmeister]].

===Contemporary architecture===
Adding [[contemporary architecture]] to Salzburg's old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the [[Mozarteum]] at the Baroque [[Mirabell Palace|Mirabell Garden]] (Architecture Robert Rechenauer),<ref>[http://www.rechenauer-architektur.de/Site/framset.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506203826/http://www.rechenauer-architektur.de/Site/framset.html|date=6 May 2012}}</ref> the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 "Makartsteg" bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the "Residential and Studio House" of the architects [[mw:de:Christine Lechner|Christine]] and [[mw:de:Horst Lechner|Horst Lechner]] in the middle of Salzburg's old town (winner of the [[mw:de:Architekturpreis des Landes Salzburg|architecture award of Salzburg 2010]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.salzburg.gv.at/themen/ks/kultur/architektur/architekturpreistraeger.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630105216/http://www.salzburg.gv.at/themen/ks/kultur/architektur/architekturpreistraeger.htm |url-status=dead |title=Preisträger Salzburg |archive-date=30 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.verbund.com/bg/en/blog/2012/01/31/building-energy-efficient-houses |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209155829/http://www.verbund.com/bg/en/blog/2012/01/31/building-energy-efficient-houses |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 February 2013 |title=flow – der VERBUND Blog |publisher=Verbund.com |date=15 October 2012 |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> Other examples of contemporary architecture lie outside the old town: the Faculty of Science building (Universität Salzburg – Architecture [[mw:de:Wilhelm Holzbauer|Willhelm Holzbauer]]) built on the edge of free green space, the [[Blobitecture|blob architecture]] of Red Bull [[Hangar-7]] (Architecture: Volkmar Burgstaller<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visit-salzburg.net/sights/hangar7.htm |title=Red Bull's Hangar-7 at Salzburg Airport |publisher=Visit Salzburg |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>) at Salzburg Airport, home to [[Dietrich Mateschitz]]'s Flying Bulls and the Europark Shopping Centre.

However, in recent years they have struggled to climb back up to the Austrian second tier and since 2019 they compete in the [[Regionalliga Salzburg]] in the Austrian Football third tier.
