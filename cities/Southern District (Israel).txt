The '''Southern District''' ({{langx|he|מחוז הדרום}}, ''Meḥoz HaDarom''; {{langx|ar|لواء الجنوب}}) is one of [[Israel]]'s [[Districts of Israel|six administrative districts]], the largest in terms of land area but the most [[Population density|sparsely populated]]. It covers most of the [[Negev]] desert, as well as the [[Arabah|Arava]] valley. The population of the Southern District is 1,086,240 and its area is 14,185&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Its population is 79.66% Jewish and 12.72% Arab (mostly Muslim), with 7.62% of other origins.<ref>[http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton63/download/st01_01.xls Area of Districts, Sub-Districts, Natural Regions and Lakes].

The district capital is [[Beersheba]], while the largest city is [[Ashdod]]. Beersheba's [[dormitory town]]s of [[Omer, Israel|Omer]], [[Meitar]], and [[Lehavim]] are affluent on an Israel scale, while the [[development town]]s of [[Dimona]], [[Sderot]], [[Netivot]], [[Ofakim]], and [[Yeruham]] and the seven [[Negev Bedouin|Bedouin]] cities are lower on the socio-economic scale.<ref>[http://adva.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AdvaNegevJanuary2007.pdf Current Plans for Developing the Negev: A Critical Perspective] Adva Center</ref>
