==History==
The villages of Niizo, Kamitoda and Shimotoda were created within [[Kitaadachi District, Saitama]] with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The villages merged on June 1, 1941, to form the town of Toda. The town annexed the village of Misasa on July 20, 1957. The rowing competition of the [[1964 Tokyo Olympics]] took place in Toda near to where the present day [[Toda-Koen Station]] is located. The rowing area which is adjacent to the Arakawa River is still in use today. Toda was elevated to city status on October 1, 1966.

==Government==
Toda has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 26 members. Toda contributes two members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Saitama 15th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Much of the residential and commercial development in Toda is due to its proximity to the city of Tokyo and the efficient commuter rail links available. This has enabled Toda to act as a [[bedroom community]] of Tokyo and is thus an apt location of residence for those who wish to work in the Tokyo Metropolis. There has been a continuous increase in population since the construction of the three Saikyo Line stations in the 1980s and this has had a positive effect on the economy and development of the city.

There are a significant number of transportation/logistics and printing-based enterprises in Toda. Large companies that have their headquarters in Toda-shi include Okazen Transportation (Haulage/Logistics), Khobho (IT services), Chiyoda (Food Manufacturing). Other large companies that have significant operations in Toda are Yamato Transportation, Meiji Dairy, Jomo, Mainichi Newspaper, Chunichi Newspaper, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Sanyo Electric, Japan Restaurant Enterprise, and Hayakawa Publishing.

==Education==
Toda has 12 public elementary schools and six public middle schools operated by the city government, and two public high schools operated by the Saitama Prefectural Board of Education.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
An arrangement of the Toda City song has been used as the [[departure melody]] for trains departing from the up platform (platform 1) of the three Saikyo Line stations in Toda since 1 August 2007.<ref name="toda_song">{{cite web |url= http://www.city.toda.saitama.jp/436/435590.html|script-title=ja:戸田市歌「ああ　わが戸田市」の発車メロディーが駅で流れます！|trans-title= Toda City Song used as station departure melody|date= 26 July 2007|work= Official website|publisher= Toda City|location= Japan|language= Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217202208/http://www.city.toda.saitama.jp/436/435590.html|archivedate=2007-12-17|url-status= dead|accessdate= 19 November 2012 }}</ref>
