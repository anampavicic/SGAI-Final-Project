'''Elazığ''' ({{IPA|tr|eˈlazɯː}}) is a city in the [[Eastern Anatolia Region|Eastern Anatolia]] region of [[Turkey]], and the administrative centre of [[Elazığ Province]] and [[Elazığ District]].<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory.

==Name==

=== Mezre ===
Elazığ was once a suburb of the ancient fortress town of [[Harpoot|Harput]] called {{Lang|tr|Mezre}}. [[Heinrich Hübschmann]] believed Mezre to be the settlement of Mazara ({{Lang|grc|Μαζάρα}}) mentioned by [[Ptolemy]], while [[Nicholas Adontz]] derived the name from an Arabic word meaning arable land or hamlet (borrowed into Turkish as {{Lang|tr|mezra}} 'hamlet').<ref name=":32">{{Cite book |last1=Hakobyan |first1=T.

===Harput===
Some Armenians from [[Harpoot|Harput]] ({{Langx|hy|Խարբերդ|translit=Kharberd}}) are said to have settled on the site in 1617, so Elazığ was sometimes called ''Nor Kharberd'' ({{literal translation}} 'New Harput') in Armenian.<ref name=":32" /> The [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] name is {{Lang|ku-Latn|Xarpêt}}.<ref name = "Avcıkıran">{{cite book |author1=Adem Avcıkıran |url= |title=Kürtçe Anamnez Anamneza bi Kurmancî |date=2009 |page=56 |language=tr, ku |access-date=}}</ref> The name of the city in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] is {{Transliteration|syc|Kartbert}} ({{Lang|syc|ܟܪܦܘܬ}}) or {{Transliteration|syc|Kharput}} ({{Lang|syc|ܟܪܬܒܪܬ}}).<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=KAZA MAMURET ÜL-AZIZ / HARPUT-MEZRE / HARPUT / ԽԱՐԲԵՐԴ – KHARBERD / ELAZIĞ (ALʿAZĪZ) / ܟܪܬܒܪܬ (ܟܪܦܘܬ) KARTBERT (KHARPUT) |url=https://virtual-genocide-memorial.de/region/the-six-provinces/harput-mamuret-uel-aziz-vilayet/sancak-harput-mezere/kaza-harput-mezere/ |access-date=17 September 2022}}</ref>

===Elazığ===
With the creation of the [[Mamuret-ul-Aziz vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire, the name ''Mamuret-ul-Aziz'' came into use as a name alternative for the city. This name quickly evolved into ''al-Aziz''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Milli Gazete {{!}} 2 Years Passed Since The Earthquake… Teachers House Still Unavailable|url=http://en.milligazete.com.tr/2_years_passed_since_the_earthquake%E2%80%A6_teachers_house_still_unavailable/12201|access-date=2022-01-20|website=en.milligazete.com.tr}}</ref> ({{langx|tr|Elaziz}}; {{langx|ku|Elezîz|script=Latn}}<ref name = "Avcıkıran"/>).

==History==
{{See also|Harpoot}}
The town of Mezre (future Elazığ) was founded on the fertile plain below the hill on which the much older fortress and settlement of Harput were constructed. It was located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=off|disp=b}} to the southwest of Harput. The [[Hurrians]], who settled in this area in {{circa}} 2000 B.C., are the earliest known inhabitants of the area. Harput and its surrounding region were part of the kingdom of [[Urartu]] at its maximum extent, and the Urartians may have been the first to build a fortress here.<ref>{{cite book |title=Anatolian Iron Ages: the proceedings of the second Anatolian Iron Ages Colloquium held at İzmir, 4–8 May 1987 |isbn = 9780946897384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDhpAAAAMAAJ&q=harput+Urartu|last1 = Çilingiroğlu|first1 = Altan|last2 = French|first2 = David H.|year = 1991}}</ref> Historian [[Hakob Manandian]] believed it to have been the main fortress of the earlier [[Hayasa-Azzi]] confederation.<ref name=":322">{{Cite book |last1=Hakobyan |first1=T.

===Ottoman Harput and Mamûretü'l-Azîz===
Harput and its vicinity fell under Turkish control in the year 1085 as a result of the [[Battle of Manzikert]], which took place on August 26, 1071. The region around the fortress changed hands frequently in the subsequent centuries, coming under the control of the [[Beylik of Çubukoğulları|Çubukoğulları]], [[Artuqids]], [[Sultanate of Rum]], [[Ilkhanate]], [[Beylik of Dulkadir]], [[Aq Qoyunlu]], [[Safavids]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D31395FB1C5180B6EBD6E28888CAE96CDD28 |title=Republic Of Turkey Ministry Of Culture And Tourism |publisher=Kultur.gov.tr |access-date=2014-08-09}}</ref>

According to an official history written in 1883, Mezre was originally a small hamlet in the vicinity of Harput which served as the official residence of the Çötelizades, one of the notable families exiled from Harput in the 1780s-90s.{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|p=45}} In 1834–36, the Çötelizades hosted the governor and military commander [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha]], who turned the hamlet into a garrison for his campaigns in the eastern regions of the empire.{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|p=49}} In the 1850s and 60s, Mezre grew into a small town or suburb of Harput with a prosperous Armenian bourgeoisie.{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|pp=143-144}} In 1869, an Armenian named Krikor Ipekjian (later Fabrikatorian) founded a silk factory in Mezre.<ref name=":32" /> In 1878, it was made the administrative centre of the [[Mamuret-ul-Aziz vilayet|Mamuret-ul-Aziz Vilayet]] (commonly referred to as the Harput Vilayet).<ref name=":32" /> According to census data from the 1880s, the population of Mezre consisted of 2,126 non-Muslim and 548 Muslim inhabitants, making it the only vilayet centre with an Armenian majority besides [[Van, Turkey|Van]].{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|p=184}} Meanwhile, Harput proper had a population of 12,974 people (5,125 were non-Muslim and 7,849 Muslim).{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|p=184}} The populous villages on the plain below also had mixed Armenian-Muslim populations.<ref name=":32" /> The population of Mezre were mainly merchants, craftsmen and bureaucrats.<ref name=":32" />

In 1892, the Armenian National Central Academy ({{Transliteration|hy|Azkayin Getronakan Varzharan}}) was founded in Mezre. By 1911, there was also an Armenian girls' school and a seminary, as well as two colleges run by French and German missionaries, among other educational institutions.<ref name=":32" /> There were four Armenian churches built in Mezre in the 19th (two [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], one [[Armenian Catholic Church|Catholic]], and one Protestant).<ref name=":32" /> Mezre, like Harput, also had a minority population of [[Terms for Syriac Christians|Syriac Christians]].<ref name=":12">{{cite journal |last1=Akopian |first1=Arman |date=2020 |title=The Syriacs of Kharberd (Kharput) on the Eve of the 1915 Genocide |journal=Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=279–322 |doi=10.31826/hug-2020-230110 |s2cid=235465241|doi-access=free }}</ref> The building of the American consulate in Harput, established in 1901, was in fact located in Mezre.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Kévorkian |first=Raymond |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbaKDwAAQBAJ |title=The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History |publisher=[[I.

Harput was an important station for the American missionaries for many years. The missionaries built [[Euphrates College]], a theological seminary, and boys' and girls' schools. It operated until 1915 when its buildings were confiscated and used by the [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman Army]] as barracks. In November 1895, government-backed [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] massacred, looted and burned the Armenian villages on the plain. In the same month, Harput was attacked and the American schools were burned down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkeyforyou.com/turkey_elazig_history|title=History of Elazig|website=www.turkeyforyou.com}}</ref><ref name="dadrian">{{cite book |first = Vahakn N. | last = Dadrian | title = The History of the Armenian Genocide | publisher = Berghahn Books | page = 160 | year = 2003 | isbn = 1571816666}}</ref> During the [[Armenian genocide]], many residents were killed.<ref>Henry H.

===Turkish Republican era===
[[File:Harput_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|Harput is a popular tourism destination in Elazığ]]

The town was captured by [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels during the [[Sheikh Said rebellion]] against the government of [[Atatürk]] in 1925.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robert|first=Olson|title=The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880–1925|year=2013|location=[[University of Texas Press]]|pages=110}}</ref> It was used as a base of operations by the [[Turkish Army]] during the [[Dersim rebellion]].

Elazığ rapidly developed into a modern city in the Republican era, while Harput was largely an abandoned ruin in the 1930s and 1940s.{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|p=414}} Efforts began in the 1950s to renovate the old town of Harput: some historic monuments were restored, a new municipality building was built and a museum was opened. Over time, Harput was turned into a suburb of Elazığ, and facilities were created for tourism and recreation.{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|p=418}} The ruined Armenian neighborhoods of Harput were leveled in the 1960s and the 1970s.{{Sfn|Sipahi|2015|p=427}}

==Ecclesiastical history==
'''Harberd''' had many Armenian churches and monasteries. Also, in '''Harberd''' was seat of a Syrian Orthodox bishop as early as the eleventh century, whose diocese was initially called '''Ḥiṣn Ziyād''' and later '''Harput'''. Unlike many Christian dioceses in Turkey, Armenian and Assyrian churches are still functioning even after the massacres that took place in the city during the [[Armenian genocide]]s and [[Sayfo|Assyrian]], in which the bishop and most of his flock were killed.<ref>Fiey, ''Pour un Oriens Christianus Novus'', 216–17</ref> The diocese has two priests, with the main church being based in the ancient Merymana Kilisesi next to the wall of the old fortress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soc-wus.org/ourchurch/Pat_V_Adiyaman.htm|title=Mor Malki Ürek|website=soc-wus.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/S%C3%BCryani+Kadim+Meryem+Ana+Kilisesi/@38.7034071,39.258492,262m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x9b028fb591dd04db!6m1!1e1|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}</ref>

An [[Armenian Catholic]] [[diocese of Kharput]] was created in 1850 but was not re-established as a residential diocese after the Armenian genocide, only as an Armenian Catholic [[Titular see]].{{fact|date=December 2022}}

An [[Armenian Evangelical Church, Elâzığ|Armenian Evangelical Church]], built in the 19th century, survives as a ruined shell of its former self in the middle of a car park.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

More than 30,000 people and at least 212 villages were affected by the construction of the [[Keban Dam]] in 1966–1974, which flooded several formerly populated areas. Many of those who were forced to move by the construction of the dam chose to settle in Elazığ and invested the indemnities paid to them by the state in houses in Elazığ or in small businesses. However, over 80% of families in zones affected by the Keban dam were landless peasants and thus ineligible to receive compensation, or peasants with little land who would receive very little money (Koyunlu 1982: 250)

The dam, industry, and mining accounts for the high level of urbanization (42.7% in 1970) surpassing the average levels for [[Eastern Anatolia Region|Eastern Anatolia]]. The main agricultural activity of the area centers around vineyards and Elazığ also serves as a market hub for other agricultural products. The state-run vineyards of Elazığ are notable for their production of [[Buzbağ]], a full-flavored [[red wine]].

Today, Elazığ is the capital of the [[Elazığ Province]]. It is a busy city with a university and an industrial base, although historic monuments are scarce. The exception is the ancient citadel and town of Harput, a dependency of the greater municipality of Elazığ today situated three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) to the north of the city centre. Elazığ is the most developed city (and province) in the region, according to a report carried out by the Ministry of Development, making it the most developed region of [[Eastern Anatolia Region]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/745288-en-gelismis-ve-en-geri-kalmis-ilimiz |title=The most developed and most undeveloped province, 25 May 2012 |publisher=Haberturk.com |date=2012-05-25 |access-date=2014-08-09}}</ref>

==Geography==
Elazığ is situated at the northwestern corner of a 30-mile-long valley, known locally as Uluova (literally ''the Great Valley''). The area's Armenians called this valley "Vosgetashd" (''the Golden Plain''). Its altitude is {{convert|3,300| feet|metres}}, latitude and longitude of 38 degrees and 41 minutes North, and 39 degrees and 14 minutes East. Elazığ Province is surrounded by the [[Euphrates]] in the north, and since the completion of [[Keban Dam]] the rivers came to cover almost ten percent of the surface area ({{convert|826|km2|sqmi}}) of the province ({{convert|8,455|km²|sqmi}}). Elazığ's adjacent province borders are with Tunceli (North), Erzincan (North-West), Bingöl (East), Diyarbakır (South), and Malatya (West).

===Subdivisions===
The city of Elazığ is divided into 41 quarters: Hilalkent, Çaydaçıra, Ataşehir, Cumhuriyet, Çatalçeşme, Doğukent, Fevziçakmak, Gümüşkavak, Karşıyaka, Kırklar, Kızılay, Kültür, Nailbey, Rızaiye, Salibaba, Sanayi, Sürsürü, Ulukent, Yeni, Zafran, Alayaprak, Esentepe, Göllübağ, Harput Merkez, Sugözü, Izzetpaşa, Akpınar, Çarşı, Icadiye, Aksaray, Mustafapaşa, Olgunlar, Rüstempaşa, Sarayatik, Üniversite, Yıldızbağları, Abdullahpaşa, Hicret, [[Şahinkaya, Elazığ|Şahinkaya]], [[Yemişlik, Elazığ|Yemişlik]] and Güneykent.<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Mahalle], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 21 December 2022.</ref>
