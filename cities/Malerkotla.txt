It served as the seat of the eponymous [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]]. The state acceded to the [[Dominion of India|union of India]] in 1947 and was merged with other nearby princely states to form the [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union|Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU)]].

When PEPSU was reorganised in 1956, the territories of the erstwhile state of Malerkotla became part of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].<ref>[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Malerkotla-76700.htm Malerkotla] Punjab at www.india9.com.</ref> It is situated on the Sangrur-Ludhiana State Highway (no. 11) and lies on the secondary Ludhiana-Delhi railway line.

In 2021, the city along with some adjoining areas were carved out of [[Sangrur district]] to form the [[Malerkotla district]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=District Malerkotla, Government of Punjab {{!}} Welcome to District Web Portal of Malerkotla {{!}} India |url=https://malerkotla.nic.in/ |access-date=2022-09-15 |language=en-US}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|Malerkotla State}}
Malerkotla, a [[Islam|Muslim]] majority state was established in 1454 by [[Sheikh]] Sadruddin-i-Jahan from [[Afghanistan]],<ref name=Tribune2006>{{cite news | first = Sushil | last = Goyal | title = 'Malerkotla has Guru's blessings' | date = August 19, 2006 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060819/saturday/main1.htm | work = [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | access-date = 2013-03-24}}</ref> and was ruled by his [[Sarwani|Sherwani]] descendants. The State of Malerkotla was established in 1600 A.D. During the [[Partition of India|1947 riots]] when Punjab was experiencing heavy amounts of communal violence, the State of Malerkotla remained relatively peaceful.<ref name=Tribune2006/>

The roots of communal harmony date back to 1705, when [[Sahibzada Zorawar Singh|Zorawar Singh]] and [[Sahibzada Fateh Singh|Fateh Singh]]  9 and 7 year old sons of tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], were ordered to be bricked alive by the governor of [[Sirhind]] [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]]. While his close relative, Sher Mohammed Khan, Nawab of Malerkotla, who was present in the court, lodged a vehement protest against this act and said it was against the tenets of the [[Quran]] and [[Islam]]. Wazir Khan nevertheless had the boys bricked into a section of wall whilst still alive. At this, the Nawab of Malerkotla walked out of the court in protest. Guru Gobind Singh on learning of this approach had blessed the Nawab and the people of Malerkotla that the city will live in the peace and happiness. In recognition of this act, the State of Malerkotla did not suffer significantly during the Partition of India, in which communal violence permeated throughout Punjab.<ref name=Tribune2006/>

Under British colonial rule, a [[Namdhari]] uprising was suppressed, and the colonial government ordered execution of 65 captured rebels and those thought to be involved with the rebellion. Cowan (the Deputy Commissioner of Ludhiana) and Forsyth (the Commissioner of Ambala) ordered the Namdharis to be executed with cannons, without any trial, on 17 and 18 January 1872.<ref>''Rebels Against the British Rule (1995)''. Bhai Nahar Singh & Bhai Kirpal Singh. Atlantic Publishers & Distributors; Page XXI</ref>

During the [[partition of India]], there were no riots or bloodshed in any part of Maler Kotla State. The last [[Nawab]] [[Iftikhar Ali Khan of Malerkotla]] maintained calm and harmony during the turbulent period. He remained in India and died in the year 1982. His tomb is located in Shahi grave yard situated at Sirhandi gate, Maler Kotla. Many also attribute this peace to the presence of the shrine of Baba Haidar Sheikh, the Sufi saint, who founded the town of Malerkotla more than 500 years ago.<ref>[https://www.nationalfilmnetwork.com/Store/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=644&Title=The%20Legend%20of%20Malerkotla:%20A%20Tale%20from%20the%20Punjab&RefPage=ProductsList.aspx&CategoryID=79 The Legend of Malerkotla: A Tale from the Punjab (2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019094523/https://www.nationalfilmnetwork.com/store/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=644&Title=The%20Legend%20of%20Malerkotla:%20A%20Tale%20from%20the%20Punjab&RefPage=ProductsList.aspx&CategoryID=79 |date=19 October 2007 }} 48 min, DVD, {{ISBN|978-0-8026-0761-4}}.</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Anna B | last = Bigelow | title = Malerkotla: A heritage going to seed | date = December 2, 2000 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20001202/windows/main1.htm | work = [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | access-date = 2013-03-24}}</ref>

==Gurudwara Haa Da Naara Sahib==

The special relationship between [[Sikhs]] and Malerkotla goes back to the period when the tenth Sikh Guru, Sri [[Guru Gobind Singh|Guru Gobind Singh ji]], was engaged in a series of battles with the oppressive Mughal rulers of the region and Sher Mohammed Khan was the Nawab of Malerkotla . Sher Mohammad Khan a General in the [[Mughal Army]], who actively participated in the military campaign against Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji, though having lost his brother and nephew in the battle of Chamkaur is said to have expressed his opposition to  bricking up alive of the  two young Sahibzadas of Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji, Zorawar Singh (aged nine years) and Fateh Singh (aged seven years), by the Subedar of [[Sirhind]], Wazir Khan in 1705 and is said to have walked out, refusing to be a part of what he declared to be opposed to the tenets of Islam.<ref name="hist">{{Cite web|title=History of Malerkotla|url=https://malerkotla.nic.in/history/|date=12 April 2022}}</ref>

It is said that he uttered â€˜haaâ€™ or â€˜haiâ€™ in anguish of the punishment imposed on the two Sahibzadas. This became known as  â€˜Haa da Naaraâ€™.<ref name="hist"/>

On learning of this, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] blessed the Nawab and the people of Malerkotla with peace everlasting. This incident has been narrated over the years and gave Malerkotla a special place in the Sikh narrative. Gurudwara â€˜Haa da Naraâ€™ was built by [[Sikhs]] to commemorate this act of Nawab Sher Mohammed Khan.<ref name="hist"/>
