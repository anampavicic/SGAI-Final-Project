'''Barrackpore''' (also known as  '''Barrackpur''') is a city and a municipality on the northern fringes of [[Kolkata]] and situated in [[North 24 Parganas district]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. The area is covered by [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA). It is the administrative headquarters of the [[Barrackpore subdivision]].

==Etymology==
The name Barrackpore may have originated from the English word [[barracks]], as it was the site of the first cantonment of the [[British East India Company]]. Alternatively, the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' suggests that the name comes from "Barbakpur".<ref>{{cite web |title=Places of Interest {{!}} NORTH 24 PARGANAS DISTRICT |url=http://north24parganas.gov.in/places_of_interest |website=north24parganas.gov.in |access-date=21 March 2021}}</ref> ''Manasa Vijay'', written by [[Bipradas Pipilai]], refers to Talpukur (a place in Barrackpore) as "Charnak".

== History ==
The earliest references to the Barrackpore region are found in the writings of the Greek navigators, geographers, chronicles and historians of the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD. These authors generally referred to the country of a people variously called the [[Gangaridai]] (also Gangaridae or Gandaritai). By the 15th and 16th centuries, Chanak and the other towns in the region had become populous river towns.<ref>De, Barun. ''W.B. District Gazetteer, 24 Parganas ed.'' 1994.</ref> The Statistical Account of Bengal by [[William Wilson Hunter|W.W.Hunter]] mentions the towns and villages of this subdivision on the banks of the Hooghly river as chief trading and marketing centres: "On The Hugli- Calcutta, the chief seat of commerce in India. Baranagar, Dakhineswar, Agarpara, Panihati, Sukchar- Khardah, Barrackpur, Nawabganj, Ichapore, Shyam Nagar, Naihati and Halisahar contain large bazaars for sale of miscellaneous goods."<ref>Hunter W.W. ''A Statistical Account of Bengal'', London, Tr√ºbner & Co.1875-1879</ref>

Under the [[Mughal Empire]], Bengal was divided into [[Circar]]s, or administrative subunits, each of which was ruled over by a Mahal. The name ''"Barbuckpur"'', another name for Barrackpore, is associated with a Mahal in the ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]''. From the 17th century, the area was ruled over by a line of [[Zamindars]] based in Nona Chandanpukur, Barrackpore.

The first [[British Empire|British]] barrack or cantonment in India was built in the town in 1772. After the British crown assumed direct control of India, the sprawling Government House and the Government Estate were built in Barrackpore to provide the [[viceroy]] with a suburban residence {{convert|20|km|mile}} outside of Calcutta.

Two rebellions against British authority took place in Barrackpore in the 19th century. The first of these was [[Barrackpore Mutiny of 1824]], led by Sepoy Bindee Tiwary.<ref>Jaideep Mazumder, The First Martyr, OUTLOOK, 25 August 2008, P.20</ref> In this rebellion, 47th [[Bengal Native Infantry]] refused to board boats to cross the sea for various reasons including social taboo "[[Kala pani (taboo)|kala pani]]" to [[Myanmar|Burma]] in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. The mutiny was suppressed by loyal Indian sepoys under the command of their British officers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley|title=A New History of India|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-533756-3|edition=8th|author-link=Stanley Wolpert|page=224}}</ref> In 1857, Barrackpore was the scene of an incident that some credit with starting the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]: an Indian soldier, [[Mangal Pandey]], attacked his British commander, and was subsequently [[court-martial]]ed. His regiment was disbanded, an action which offended a number of [[sepoy]]s and is considered to have contributed to the anger that fuelled the rebellion. In order to commemorate his actions, a park named 'Sahid Mangal Pandey Udyan' was opened in the serenity of river Hoogly. The Army cantonment of Barrackpore also houses another significant historical [[landscape]] called the RCTC area, now populated by the defence quarters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rctconline.com/booktext/book7.html |title= During the early 1920's RCTC was looking for a suitable land to set up its own race course, should anything go wrong over the|website=rctconline.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705083411/http://www.rctconline.com/booktext/book7.html |archive-date=5 July 2008}}</ref>

===Zoo===
Asia's first [[zoo]] was established at Barrackpore. The zoo was built by [[Lord Wellesley]] in the 19th century. There is an aviary built in magnificent [[Gothic architecture]].The zoo had animals such as the [[African donkey]], [[Bengal tiger|tiger]], [[bear]], [[Indian bison|bison]], [[Indian leopard|leopard]], [[mouse]] [[deer]], kangaroos, monkeys and various species of birds.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Karkun |first=Amitabh |title=Asia's first zoo |url=https://www.anandabazar.com/rabibashoriyo/asia-s-first-zoological-garden-was-in-barrackpore-1.936043 |access-date=2023-04-02 |website=anandabazar.com |language=bn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Asia's first zoo at Barrackpore was even older to London Zoo! Surprised? |url=https://www.getbengal.com/details/asias-first-zoo-at-barrackpore-was-even-older-to-london-zoo-surprised |access-date=2023-04-02 |website=Get Bengal |language=en}}</ref>

[[Lord Wellesley]] felt the need of making a detailed description of the animals in [[Asia]]. This was primarily because the [[Europeans]] were mostly ignorant when it came to the category of Indian animals. He started working on the first Natural Research Center in Asia, the 'National Heritage of India'. Various animals were required to be collected. Barrackpore Zoo was built to store these animals and birds. Until 1804, ‚Çπ2,791 was invested in the cost of maintenance of these animals and birds.

Until 1802 and 1803, then only three zoos were open to the general public around the world.  The first in [[Sch√∂nbrunn Zoo|Vienna (1765)]], the second in [[Zoo Aquarium de Madrid|Madrid (1775)]], the third in [[Paris Zoological Park|Paris (1795)]].  Even the '[[Zoological Society of London]]' was not yet formed (to be formed in 1826). London Zoo was still a long way off, having started in 1828, and was still 43 years late for the general public.  Subjects do not have access to the royal zoo. It is surprising to think that at such a time sixteen miles north of Calcutta, Barrackpore, the first zoo in India, the first in Asia and probably the fourth in the world, opened to the general public.  This revolutionary work in the history of naturalism in the world was done by an enterprising man of the [[East India Company]], the Governor General of India, Lord Richard Wellesley, the first Marquess Wellesley.

Later due to decrease in funds by [[East India Company]] to run the zoo, the birds, animal (like elephant and tigers) were distributed into kings of [[Princely state]]s.

===Barrackpore park===
Between 1798‚Äì1805, [[Lord Wellesley]] was the Governor of Kolkata and he created a picturesque garden on the banks of the Ganges in Barrackpore spreading across 1006 bighas of land. This garden is today, called Laat Bagan or Mangal Pandey Park.Right next to this garden, he built a gigantic house which resembled no less than a castle. Later, this house was named Barrackpore Government House. It was called Country House by British. It also had hospital at that time. For transport he made road from Barrackpore to [[Shyambazar]], now known as [[Barrackpore Trunk Road|B.T.Road]].
