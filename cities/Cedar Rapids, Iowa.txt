==History==
[[File:DowntownCedarRapids.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Cedar Rapids, overlooking the Cedar River]]
[[File:Downtown Cedar Rapids.jpg|thumb|left|Second Avenue SE in downtown Cedar Rapids, looking towards the Cedar River]]

===Early history===
The location of present-day Cedar Rapids was in the territory of the [[Fox tribe|Fox]] and [[Sac tribe|Sac]] tribes at the time of European American settlement.

The first settler on the site of the future city was Osgood Shepherd, who built a log cabin (which he called a tavern) in 1837 or 1838 next to the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]] (then known as the Red Cedar) at what is now the corner of First Avenue and First Street Northeast. Shepherd was a squatter who claimed the land without legal title and also a reputed ne'er-do-well, who, if he was not a horse thief himself, definitely consorted with them. Early on, it appears that he "jumped the claim" of another squatter, Wilbert Stone, who had built a cabin and platted out a town, some distance south of Shepherd's cabin, that he called Columbus. Shepherd drove Stone across the river, claiming that Stone had built his cabin on Shepherd's land, then sold Stone's cabin to a buyer named Hull. Shepherd later tried the same tactic with perhaps the first settler on the west side of the river, Robert Ellis, but Ellis happened to be chopping wood at the time and warned that someone would be dead if Shepherd did not retreat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Linn County Iowa, From its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time|last=Brewer|first=Luther|publisher=Forgotten Books|year=2012 |edition=Reprint of 1911 |location=Chicago|pages=307, et seq}}</ref>

The true founders of the city were [[George Greene (judge)|George Greene]], Nicholas Brown, and a few others. Brown had experience as a miller and Greene had surveyed much of eastern Iowa,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Story of Cedar Rapids|last=Murray|first=Janet Stevenson and Frederick Gray|publisher=Stratford House|year=1950|location=New York|pages=3}}</ref> so both saw the value of the spot Shepherd had claimed. It was right next to the rapids—a prime spot to build a mill—the last set of rapids on the river before the Cedar fed into the Iowa River, meaning that goods milled on the spot could be carried by boat down river to the Mississippi. In 1841, they formed a partnership that bought out Shepherd's claim and platted out a town they called Rapids City. Brown immediately constructed a primitive dam and then built the town's first mill. His crude dam soon washed away, prompting Greene to induce Alexander Ely, an engineer from Michigan, to build a proper dam that created a [[mill race]] capable of powering several mills.<ref>Murray, p.3</ref>

At this time, the city was confined to the east side of the river. The west bank soon contained a village named Kingston for resident David King who early on operated a rope ferry across the river.

The town was formally incorporated by the Iowa State Legislature on January 15, 1849<ref>Tom Savage (2007). ''A Dictionary of Iowa Place-names''</ref> as Cedar Rapids, named for the [[rapids]] in the Cedar River (the river itself was named for the large number of [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]] trees that grew along its banks).<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|year=1908|page=54 |via=Google Books}}</ref> The population was less than 400.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Czech Village and New Bohemia|last=Rasdal|first=Dave|publisher=The History Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-46711-761-6|location=Charleston, SC|pages=19}}</ref>

During the 1850s, Cedar Rapids grew in size, and it was during this decade that the Czech population became substantial; when the town was reincorporated in 1856, a quarter of its roughly 1,600 inhabitants were Czech immigrants.<ref>Rasdal, p. 20</ref>  The availability of cheap land in the new state of Iowa happened to coincide with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]] that caused a large number of Czechs to flee their homeland and emigrate to the U.S.. In 1851, the institution that eventually become [[Coe College]] was founded. In the same decade, there were attempts by local leaders to improve the city's access to distant markets, first through purchase of a steamboat (aptly named ''Cedar Rapids'') and ultimately through investment in a railroad. The first locomotive rolled into town on June 15, 1859.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tales of the Town: Little Known Anecdotes of Life in Cedar Rapids|last=Clements|first=Ralph|publisher=Stamats Publishing Company|year=1967|location=Cedar Rapids, IA|pages=23}}</ref>

Railroads were an important factor in the development of the state and the growth of cities along the rail lines. By the end of the 19th century, the 23rd largest state was the fifth largest in track mileage.<ref name="auto">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]] |title=Union Station was hub of downtown Cedar Rapids |date=June 17, 2012 |url=https://www.thegazette.com/2012/06/17/union-station-was-hub-of-downtown-cedar-rapids}}</ref>

In this same decade, "Major" John May, an inventor and land speculator, purchased the island (now called "[[Mays Island|May's Island]]") situated between Cedar Rapids and Kingston with the intention of founding a town he called May Island. When that scheme proved impractical due to the island's tendency to flood, he conceived the idea of making his island the center of a larger city that spanned the river and convinced the state legislature to officially name the land he had bought there, just south of Kingston, "West Cedar Rapids."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/portraitbiograph00chap_10|title=Portrait and Biographical Album of Linn County, Iowa|publisher=Chapman Brothers|year=1887|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/portraitbiograph00chap_10/page/761 761]}}</ref>

Cedar Rapids [[Municipal annexation|annexed]] the community of Kingston in 1870 and constructed an iron bridge across the river along the line of the current Third Avenue bridge.

The economic growth of Cedar Rapids increased in 1871 upon the founding of the Sinclair [[meatpacking]] company. The plant allowed for year-round meatpacking because ice could be harvested from the Cedar River in winter to chill an icehouse, and within a few years it became one of the largest factories of its kind in the country, employing 400 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brucemore.org/history/people/sinclair/|title=The Sinclair Family|website=Brucemore.org}}</ref> In 1873, the oatmeal mill that ultimately became the flagship operation of the [[Quaker Oats Company]] - and the largest cereal mill in the world - was built.

In 1909, the city acquired May's Island for the purpose of making it the seat of government; then, as now, there were ill feelings between east- and west-siders in Cedar Rapids, and the city's leaders hoped that putting City Hall in the "neutral territory" of the island would help ease tensions. In 1919, the residents of Linn County voted to move the county seat from [[Marion, Iowa|Marion]] to Cedar Rapids, partially because Cedar Rapids had offered to donate the southern third of the island as a site for a new county courthouse and jail.

===Flood of 2008===
[[File:Dairy Queen, Cedar Rapids, June 12 2008.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Flooded Business District on June 12, 2008]]
During the [[Iowa flood of 2008]], the Cedar River reached a record high of {{convert|31.12|ft|m}} on June 13 (the previous record was {{convert|20|ft|m}}), surpassing the 500-year [[flood plain]]. 1,126 [[city block]]s were flooded, or more than {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}, and 561 city blocks were severely damaged, on both banks of the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]], comprising 14% of the city's total area. 7,749 flooded properties had to be evacuated, including 5,900 homes and 310 city facilities, among them the [[Seat of local government|City Hall]], Central Fire Station, [[Cedar Rapids Public Library|Main Public Library]], Ground Transportation Center, Public Works building, and the Animal Control building. It is estimated that at least 1,300 properties in the Cedar Rapids area had to be demolished because of the flood, which caused several billions of dollars in damages. More than 4,000 members of the Iowa National Guard were activated to assist the city. The temporary levees became saturated not only with the flood waters but also with additional rainfall, causing them to fail.<ref name="CRflood2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.cedar-rapids.org/government/departments/public-works/engineering/Flood%20Protection%20Information/Pages/2008FloodFacts.aspx|title=Flood of 2008 Facts & Statistics|publisher=City of Cedar Rapids, Iowa|access-date=June 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617084557/http://www.cedar-rapids.org/government/departments/public-works/engineering/Flood%20Protection%20Information/Pages/2008FloodFacts.aspx|archive-date=June 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=AgDayEvacuated>{{cite news | last = Blin | first = Crystal | title = Cedar River Expected to Crest, Town Evacuated | url = http://www.agweb.com/article/cedar-river-expected-to-crest-town-evacuated-naa-ashley-davenport/ | work = [[AgDay]] | date = September 27, 2016 | access-date = September 28, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160928165256/http://www.agweb.com/article/cedar-river-expected-to-crest-town-evacuated-naa-ashley-davenport/ | archive-date = September 28, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

In 2015, Cedar Rapids approved a $625 million flood protection plan over 20 years for levee improvements.<ref name=DMRegisterLevee/> Although the improvement to the levee system in Cedar Rapids had not been completed due to over $80 million in funding not appropriated by the [[United States Congress]]es of [[114th United States Congress|2014]] and [[114th United States Congress|2016]] and the voting down by local residents of a temporary increase in the local sales tax to pay for the levee improvements,{{efn|$15 million in revenues are expected from a 2016 passage of a local sales tax increase to provide some funding for levee improvements.<ref name=DMRegisterLevee/>}} out of school students along with hundreds of thousands of volunteers and 412 Iowa National Guard troops filled more than a quarter of a million sandbags in a successful effort to prevent any major flooding of the city outside the evacuation zone.<ref name=DMRegisterLevee/><ref name=SentTribLevee>{{cite news | title = Iowa city braces for highest floodwaters since 2008 record | url = http://www.sent-trib.com/news/iowa-city-braces-for-highest-floodwaters-since-record/article_8b17cd82-84c3-11e6-a2c6-5fbd284fac12.html | newspaper = Bowling Green Sentinel-Tribune | location = [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = September 27, 2016 | access-date = September 28, 2016 | archive-date = August 28, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210828202936/https://www.sent-trib.com/news/iowa-city-braces-for-highest-floodwaters-since-record/article_8b17cd82-84c3-11e6-a2c6-5fbd284fac12.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> A {{convert|9.8|mi|km|adj=on}} system of [[Hesco bastion|Hesco barriers]], earthen berms, and over 400,000 sandbags were used to plug the gaps in the levee system.<ref name=DMRegisterLevee/><ref name=IPR>{{cite news | last1 = Leland | first1 = Michael | last2 = Borg | first2 = Dean | title = Cedar Rapids Sees River Crest, Flood Protection Holding | url = http://iowapublicradio.org/post/cedar-rapids-sees-river-crest-flood-protection-holding#stream/0 | work = [[Iowa Public Radio]] | date = September 27, 2016 | access-date = September 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=WHOHesco>{{cite news | last = Whitworth | first = Jodi | title = Cedar Rapids' Levee Protection System Battling Floods | url = http://whotv.com/2016/09/27/cedar-rapids-levee-protection-system-battling-floods/ | work = WHO tv | location = Des Moines | date = September 27, 2016 | access-date = September 28, 2016}}</ref> The city of Cedar Rapids purchased additional Hesco barriers from Iowa City for $1.4 million.<ref name=KCCIHesco>{{cite news | title = Flood Summary: Thousands will return home Wednesday | url = http://www.kcci.com/news/flood-summary-temporary-floodwalls-continue-to-hold/41861348 | work = [[KCCI]] | location = Des Moines | date = September 28, 2016 | access-date = September 28, 2016}}</ref> Numerous upstream cities that had been earlier affected by the September flooding and mandatory evacuations, including [[Charles City, Iowa|Charles City]], [[Greene, Iowa|Greene]], [[Manchester, Iowa|Manchester]], [[Clarksville, Iowa|Clarksville]], [[Shell Rock, Iowa|Shell Rock]], [[Vinton, Iowa|Vinton]], [[Janesville, Iowa|Janesville]], [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]] and [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], sent hundreds of thousands of unused sandbags to support efforts in Cedar Rapids and nearby communities.<ref name=AgDay27/><ref name=DMRegisterUpstream/> The remnants of Hurricane Paine did not produce any rain to saturate the temporary earth berms and sandbags, which would have greatly increased the likelihood of breach in the temporary levee structures, causing a much greater flooded area; the river crested during very sunny weather.

=== August 10, 2020, Midwest derecho ===
On August&nbsp;10, 2020, [[August 2020 Midwest derecho|an intense derecho]] formed over the [[Midwest]] and moved eastward across [[Iowa]], with Cedar Rapids being the hardest-hit city. Sustained winds of {{convert|60|to|80|mph|kph}}, frequent [[Wind gust|gusts]] of {{convert|110|mph|kph}} or greater, and an estimated peak gust of {{convert|140|mph|kph}} on the southwest side of the city damaged the majority of residential and commercial buildings in Cedar Rapids, as well as 20 schools, and resulted in the closure of most local businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|last=US Department of Commerce|first=NOAA|title=Midwest Derecho - August 10, 2020, Updated: 8/20/20 11 am|url=https://www.weather.gov/dvn/summary_081020|access-date=2020-09-12|website=weather.gov}}</ref> Thousands of trees were downed throughout all 75 square miles of Cedar Rapids. Most of the city's roads became mostly blocked or impassible due to downed trees and blown limbs, power poles along with their lines, and general debris, like large road signs, as well as damaged buildings, homes, and farms. 95% of the city was without power.

On Friday, August&nbsp;14, Governor [[Kim Reynolds]] arrived in Cedar Rapids, accompanied by Adjutant General Benjamin Corell of the Iowa National Guard. Gen. Corell said he had not seen a comparable level of damage since [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. Other city officials described the damage as being even worse than the [[Iowa flood of 2008]].<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|date=2020-08-14|title="We're Here Now": Governor Reynolds, National Guard finally arrive in Cedar Rapids on Friday|url=http://kwwl.com/2020/08/14/watch-live-gov-reynolds-holds-news-conference-from-cedar-rapids-updating-on-storm-relief/|access-date=2020-08-16|publisher=KWWL News 7}}</ref>

==Geography==
The city is divided into four quadrants, used in assigning street addresses. 1st Avenue ([[U.S. Route 151 Business (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)|U.S. Route 151 Business]]) divides the north and south sides of the city, and the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]] divides east and west. [[Mays Island]], in the middle of the river, is the only area of the city where addresses have no quadrant. Areas outside the city limits that have a Cedar Rapids mailing address do not use the quadrants either.

Except in the downtown area, 1st Avenue and the Cedar River tend to run diagonally instead of along the cardinal directions. Due to the curving of 1st Avenue, there are some areas in western Cedar Rapids where NW addresses are actually south of SW addresses.

Cedar Rapids is divided into 14 [[ZIP Code]]s. Mays Island and the downtown area are covered by 52401. The northeast quadrant is covered by 52402 and 52411. The southeast quadrant is covered by 52403. The southwest quadrant is covered by 52404. The northwest quadrant is covered by 52405. [[Post office box]]es are covered by ZIP codes 52406, 52407, 52408, 52409, and 52410. Several other ZIP codes are for specific businesses ([[Transamerica Corporation|Aegon]] USA, [[Collins Aerospace]], etc.).

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|72.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|70.8|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=May 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:Czech Village in Cedar Rapids.jpg|thumb|right|Czech Village is at the heart of the city's Czech heritage. Pictured is Sykora Bakery which is now open to the public.]]
There are twelve active neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids. The neighborhoods nearest downtown include Wellington Heights and Oakhill Jackson in the southeast quadrant and Moundview in the northeast quadrant. Also farther north in the northeast quadrant are Noelridge Park and Kenwood Park, which was independent until it was incorporated into the Cedar Rapids city limits. The boundaries of Kenwood are 32nd Street to Oakland Road to Old Marion Road to C Avenue to 40th Street then 1st Avenue between 40th street and 32nd Street.<ref name="crneighborhoods">{{cite web|url=http://www.crneighborhoods.org/|title=CR Neighborhoods|publisher= Home|access-date=December 13, 2010}}</ref>

In addition to the neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids, there are many informal, unofficial neighborhoods, such as Bowman Woods, Vernon Heights, Stoney Point, Kingston Village, [[New Bohemia (NewBo)]] and Wilderness Estates.

[[Czech Village]] is located along 16th Avenue SW, south of the Cedar River. It is home to such Czech-themed businesses as The Czech Cottage, Sykora Bakery, and White Lion Treasures. The [[National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library]] is one of Cedar Rapids' major tourist attractions. The museum's main building was directly on the river and was badly damaged by the 2008 floods. After the flood the museum moved a few blocks to Inspiration Place SW. The Bohemian National Cemetery is located nearby.

The Cedar Rapids Czech Heritage Foundation is one of many local organizations working to promote and preserve Czech heritage in Cedar Rapids. It supports and sponsors many programs and events throughout the year, including the Miss Czech-Slovak Iowa pageant. Two Miss Czech-Slovak US queens can claim this community as home: Lisa Volesky and Stasia Krivanek.

Olga Drahozal was the famed band leader of the Czech Plus Polka Band, a performing group that frequents the Kosek Band Stand in Czech Village. She, Bessie Duggena, and Leona Poduška taught Czech School (''Česká škola'') at Wilson Middle School.

In 2003, the African-American Historical Museum and Cultural Center of Iowa opened its doors. Cedar Rapids is also home to the historic 26-acre (105,000 m<sup>2</sup>) [[Brucemore|Brucemore Estate]], on which sits a 21-room mansion, and the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Library and Museum.

In 2009, Cedar Rapids was rated one of the "Top 10 cities to Grow Up In" in the United States, partly due to a low crime rate and a good public school system.<ref>[http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/americas-10-best-places-to-grow-up.html Yahoo!

== Flag ==
The current flag of Cedar Rapids was adopted on September 8, 2021. On the flag, the blue represents the [[Cedar River (Iowa River tributary)|Cedar River]] and the green portrays the city's green areas. Withal, the arch represents forwards progress, as well as the city's [[flood wall]] and the star represents the historic structures on [[Mays Island]] with its five stars depicting the City of Five Seasons.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=City Flag Redesign|url=https://www.cedar-rapids.org/discover_cedar_rapids/city_flag/index.php|access-date=2021-02-09|website=cedar-rapids.org}}</ref>

=== History ===
In 1962, a flag design was chosen through a design contest among high schools. The artist, Fred Easker Jr, was a high-school senior at the time. The flag depicts buildings of Cedar Rapids in blue and the words "Cedar Rapids" and "Iowa" above and below it in red. Among the buildings depicted were: a veterans memorial, a church, corn stalks, a factory, an early mill and an unfinished building to signify the city's promising future.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cedar Rapids Flag History|url=http://www.cedar-rapids.org/discover_cedar_rapids/city_flag/history_of_cedar_rapids_flag.php|access-date=2021-09-19|website=www.cedar-rapids.org}}</ref>

In 2004, the [[North American Vexillological Association]] ranked Cedar Rapids' flag as among the worst flags in the [[United States]]. Moreover, the flag was decried during a [[TED Talk]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Morelli|first=B.

Residents were asked for input on the colors, symbols, and themes they would like to have the flag include. On September 18, 2021, the city unveiled a new flag at [[Cedar Rapids Public Library]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cedar Rapids' new city flag represents 'History and Progress'|url=https://www.thegazette.com/local-government/cedar-rapids-new-city-flag-represents-history-and-progress/|access-date=2021-09-19|website=www.thegazette.com|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

From April 6, 1908, to December 31, 2005, Cedar Rapids used the [[City Commission government|city commission]] form of government. It was one of the few larger American cities remaining to operate under this model. Under this form of government, the council was made up of a public safety commissioner, a streets commissioner, a finance commissioner, a parks commissioner, and a mayor. The council members worked on a full-time basis, served two-year terms, and were considered department heads. [[Don Canney]], the longest-serving mayor in city history, served for twenty-two years under this system.<ref name=gazette>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Smith|title=Corbett is forming committee to name memorial for Don Canney |url=http://thegazette.com/2011/03/24/corbett-is-forming-committee-to-name-memorial-for-don-canney/|work=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]] |location=Cedar Rapids |date=March 24, 2011 |access-date=April 8, 2011}}</ref> The last mayor of Cedar Rapids under this form of government was [[Paul Pate]].

In 2005 the Cedar Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce spearheaded a movement to change from the commission form of government. A panel was appointed by Mayor Pate and the City Council to study the issue, and recommended that voters be presented with three options:
* Retain the current commission form of government.
* Adopt a "strong mayor form" where the council would be part-time, the mayor would be full-time, and a city manager would run the day-to-day affairs of the city.
* Adopt a "weak mayor form" of government, in this form the mayor and council would both work on a part-time basis. A full-time city manager would run the day-to-day operations of the city.
On June 14, 2005, voters went to the polls to decide whether to adopt a new form of government or continue with the commission form. 28,818 of the 83,514 registered voters (29.72%) cast ballots on the issue.  68.80% of the voters decided to adopt a new form of government.<ref name="election results">{{cite web|url=http://www.linncounty.org/files/download.asp?type=Adobe&mode=view&I=1265|title=Election Results|access-date=January 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034208/http://www.linncounty.org/files/download.asp?type=Adobe&mode=view&I=1265|archive-date=July 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Elections were held on November 8, 2005, and 30 candidates ran. Kay Halloran, a retired attorney and state legislator, became the first mayor elected under the new system. Several members of the city council were elected outright; however, the remaining races were close enough to require a [[Two-round system|runoff election]], which took place in December.

Cedar Rapids now has an Iowa "Home Rule" charter which establishes a [[Mayor-council government|weak mayor]] system with a part-time City Council and Mayor both on four-year terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedar-rapids.org/overview/documents/1226_CedarRapidsHomeRuleCharter.pdf|title=Home Rule Charter|access-date=June 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910231106/http://www.cedar-rapids.org/overview/documents/1226_CedarRapidsHomeRuleCharter.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>
