The city lies in the north-western corner of the Bay of Plenty, on the south-eastern edge of [[Tauranga Harbour]]. The city extends over an area of {{convert|141.91|km2}}, and encompasses the communities of [[Bethlehem, New Zealand|Bethlehem]], on the south-western outskirts of the city; [[Greerton]], on the southern outskirts of the city; Matua, west of the central city overlooking Tauranga Harbour; Maungatapu; [[Mount Maunganui]], located north of the central city across the harbour facing the Bay of Plenty; [[Otūmoetai]]; [[Papamoa]], Tauranga's largest suburb, located in the Bay of Plenty; Tauranga City; [[Tauranga South]]; and [[Welcome Bay]].

Tauranga is one of New Zealand's main centres for business, international trade, culture, fashion and horticultural science. The [[Port of Tauranga]] is New Zealand's largest port in terms of gross export tonnage and efficiency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.port-tauranga.co.nz/ |title=Port of Tauranga Limited – New Zealand's largest and most efficient port – Port of Tauranga |publisher=Port-tauranga.co.nz |access-date=20 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915070956/http://www.port-tauranga.co.nz/ |archive-date=15 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tauranga is one of New Zealand's fastest-growing cities, with an 11% increase in population between the 2006 census and the 2013 census,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/224710/auckland-drives-5-percent-population-growth |title=Auckland drives 5% population growth &#124; Radio New Zealand News |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |date=15 October 2013 |access-date=20 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924132815/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/224710/auckland-drives-5-percent-population-growth |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> and 19% between the 2013 and 2018 census.

==History==

===Settlement===
The earliest known settlers were [[Māori people|Māori]], who arrived in the 13th century at Tauranga in the [[Tākitimu]] and the [[Mātaatua]] [[Waka (canoe)|waka]].<!-- Something about their culture for 600 years? -->

Europeans trading in [[Phormium|flax]] were active in the Bay of Plenty during the 1830s; some were transient, others married local women and settled permanently. The first permanent non-Maori trader was [[James Farrow (trader)|James Farrow]], who travelled to Tauranga in 1829, obtaining flax fibre for Australian merchants in exchange for [[musket]]s and [[gunpowder]]. Farrow acquired a land area of {{convert|1/2|acre|m2|order=flip}} on 10 January 1838 at [[Otūmoetai|Otūmoetai Pā]] from the chiefs [[Hori Kingi Tupaea|Tupaea]], Tangimoana and Te Omanu, the earliest authenticated land purchase in the Bay of Plenty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tauranga.govt.nz/knowledgebase/tabid/624/qid/1164/tctl/1332_ViewQuestion/Default.aspx |access-date=18 June 2009 |url-status=dead |title=The Traders |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020050102/http://www.tauranga.govt.nz/knowledgebase/tabid/624/qid/1164/tctl/1332_ViewQuestion/Default.aspx |archive-date=20 October 2008 }}</ref>

===New Zealand Wars–Tauranga Campaign===
The [[Tauranga Campaign]] took place in and around Tauranga from 21 January to 21 June 1864, during the [[New Zealand Wars]]. The Battle of Gate Pa is the best known.

The [[Tauranga Campaign#Battle of Gate Pā|Battle of Gate Pā]] was an attack on the well fortified [[Pā]] and its Māori defenders on 29 April 1864 by British forces made up of approximately 300 men of the 43rd Regiment and a naval contingent. The British casualties were 31 dead (including 10 officers), and 80 wounded – the single most devastating loss of life suffered by the British military in the whole of the New Zealand Wars.  The Māori defenders abandoned the Pā during the night with casualties estimated at 25 dead and an unknown number of wounded.<ref name="cowan42">{{cite book| last = Cowan| first = James| author-link = James Cowan (New Zealand writer)| title = The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period, Vol. 1, 1845–1864| publisher = RNZ Government Printer| year   = 1922| location = Wellington| chapter = 42, Gate Pa and Te Ranga| chapter-url  = http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c42.html}}</ref>

==Geography==
Tauranga is located around a large harbour that extends along the western [[Bay of Plenty]], and is protected by [[Matakana Island]] and the extinct volcano of [[Mount Maunganui (mountain)|Mauao]] (Mount Maunganui). [[Ngamuwahine River]] is located 19 kilometres southwest of Tauranga.

[[File:Street in Tauranga, 1924. ATLIB 296372.png|thumb|View down The Strand from the intersection of Harington St in 1924, including Tauranga Hotel and the Farmers' Union Trading Company buildings]]
Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty]] are situated along a faultline and so experience (infrequent) seismic activity. There are a few [[volcanoes]] around the area (mainly dormant). The most notable of these are [[Whakaari/White Island|White Island]] and Mauao, nicknamed "The Mount" by locals.

Tauranga is roughly the [[antipodes|antipode]] of [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], Spain.

==Demographics==
In 1976 Tauranga was a medium-sized urban area with a population of around 48,000. However, the completion of a harbour bridge in 1988 brought Tauranga and The Mount closer (they amalgamated in 1989) and re-energised the economies of both parts of the enlarged city.
By 1996 Tauranga's population had grown to 82,092 and by 2006 it had reached 103,635.<ref>Geonames Database [http://www.travelsradiate.com/oceania/new-zealand/tauranga/2208032 "Region information page"]{{dead link|date=October 2024|fix-attempted=yes}}, ''travelsradiate'', 2010, accessed 2 January 2011.</ref> By 2023, it had reached 152,844.<ref name="Census 2023"/> 

In 2008 Tauranga overtook [[Dunedin]] to become the [[Ranked list of New Zealand main urban areas|sixth-largest]] city in New Zealand by urban area, and the [[List of cities in New Zealand|ninth largest]] city by [[Territorial Authorities of New Zealand|Territorial Authority]] area. With continuing growth it has now surpassed the Napier-Hastings area to become New Zealand's fifth-largest city.

==Government and politics==
For elections to the [[New Zealand Parliament]], the city of Tauranga is in the [[Tauranga (New Zealand electorate)|Tauranga]] and [[Bay of Plenty (New Zealand electorate)|Bay of Plenty]] electorates.

Tauranga is located in the administrative area of the [[Tauranga City Council]]. The council consists of the [[Mayor of Tauranga]] and nine councillors. The mayor is elected by the city [[at-large]], while the councillors are elected from nine wards (constituencies), each ward electing a single councillor. Elections are held via [[single transferable vote]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Elections 2024 |url=https://www.tauranga.govt.nz/council/about-your-council/elections-2024 |website=tauranga.govt.nz |publisher=Tauranga City Council |access-date=3 August 2024}}</ref>

The present nine wards were first established for the 2024 local elections. There are eight general wards (Mauao/Mount Maunganui, Arataki, Pāpāmoa, Welcome Bay, Matua-Otūmoetai, Bethlehem, Tauriko and Te Papa) and one [[Māori wards and constituencies|Māori ward]] (Te Awanui, covering the entire city).<ref>{{cite web |title=Tauranga City Council Wards|url=https://gis.tauranga.govt.nz/portal/apps/instant/lookup/index.html?appid=5ef10bdd28b94784b53f2116b7b51164 |website=tauranga.govt.nz |publisher=Tauranga City Council |access-date=3 August 2024}}</ref>

Council elections are usually held every three years, most recently in [[2024 Tauranga local elections|2024]].
