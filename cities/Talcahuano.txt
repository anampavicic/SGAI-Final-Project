It is part of the [[Greater Concepción]] conurbation. Talcahuano is located in the south of the [[Zona Central, Chile|Central Zone]] of Chile.

==Geography==
Together with ten other municipalities, it forms part of the [[Concepción Province, Chile|Concepción Province]], which in turn is one of four provinces that forms the VIII Region of [[Biobío Region]].

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 [[census]] of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], Talcahuano spans an area of {{convert|145.8|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has 250,348 inhabitants (121,778 men and 128,570 women).

== History ==
The official foundation date of Talcahuano is 5 November 1764 when [[Antonio de Guill y Gonzaga]] declared it an official port. However, the site of Talcahuano began to appear in history books as early as 1544 when [[Genoa|Genoese]] captain [[Juan Bautista Pastene]] discovered the mouth of the Biobío river while exploring the coast in his ships ''San Pedro'' and ''Santiaguillo''.  In 1601 [[Alonso de Ribera]] built Fort Talcahueno to defend remaining Spanish settlements near [[Penco|Concepción]].

The city is named after an Araucanian chief, Talcahueñu, who inhabited the region at the arrival of the Spanish. In [[Mapudungun]], the language of the indigenous [[Mapuche]]s, Talcahuano means "Thundering Sky".

The port was well known to American whaleships of the 19th century.  They often put in for fresh water, food, and various forms of entertainment for the crews.

On 24 January 1939 at around 23.33 the city was hit by a major earthquake of 8.3 which had an epicenter close to the city of [[Chillán]]. The Chilean Government requested from the British Government the help of two British cruisers [[HMS Ajax (22)]] and [[HMS Exeter (68)]] then visiting the city of [[Valparaíso]] to head south to investigate. The ships arrived at Talcahuano on 25th, many of the city's main buildings had been destroyed with little power, food or water available to the survivors. The two ships crews helped with rubble clearing, rescuing those still trapped, recovering bodies as well as the ships taking trips north to Valparaiso with those injured and refugees.<ref>Holman, D. ''The Man They Couldn't Kill'' London 1960  pp44-46</ref>
