==Economy==
{{PH poverty incidence}} 

Residents of Bulan are now looking forward to its city hood because of its rapid-economic growth considering the fact that it is cited as the richest municipality in the province and 5th among the 1st class municipalities in [[Bicol Region]] with an average annual income of PHP 58.8M (2009). If it happens, Bulan will be the second city in the province and will be the 8th in the region.

Major exports of this town are from its coastal waters, agricultural lands produce [[rice]], [[copra]], [[abaca]] fiber. Most of the revenues come from the fishing port of Bulan and businesses.


=== Development areas ===

Commercial businesses are heavily concentrated in the town center. The expansion of the commercial area under the Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) has been approved, stretching from the Poblacion Zone Business District to Zone 7, Barangay Aquino, and extending to Barangay Fabrica. This will form the new Central Business District (CBD) of the town, aimed at alleviating traffic congestion and reducing the burden on commercial establishments in the downtown area. The expansion also includes an 80-meter radius on both sides of the National Highway.

Due to Bulan's rapidly growing economy and revenue, alongside its large population growth, the old and unfinished Bulan airport will start construction soon and will serve as the gateway to the province of [[Sorsogon]].

Bulan port also will undergo rehabilitation so locals would not have to go to [[Matnog]] to access the [[Visayas]] and [[Masbate]] Area.

=== Growth ===

Although poverty is still high in Bulan, the government has improve people's lives. Bulan is ranked in the Top 10 richest municipalities out of 107 Municipalities in the [[Bicol Region]], from 5th to 2nd fastest growing as of 2021 with an average annual income of 145.60M (41.91% increase) after [[Aroroy]], Masbate.
