==History==
Human settlement in the Hitachi area dates to at least the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period. In the early [[Nara period]], the area was defined as part of Taga Province, which was then merged into [[Hitachi Province]] under the ''[[Ritsuryō]]'' system. By the [[Sengoku period]], the area was under the control of the [[Satake clan]]. Following the creation of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] ordered the Satake to [[Dewa Province]], and the area became part of the domain's awarded to Ieyasu's son [[Tokugawa Yorifusa]]. The area remained part of [[Mito Domain]] until the [[Meiji restoration]].

The village of Hitachi was formed on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The area rapidly developed towards the end of the [[Meiji period]] under the direction of [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]] of the Kuhara [[zaibatsu]] with the opening of copper mines, and under [[Namihei Odaira]], the founder of Hitachi. The village of Hitachi was raised to town status on August 26, 1924. Hitachi and the neighboring town of Sukegawa merged on September 1, 1939, to form the city of Hitachi.

The city suffered from major damage in [[World War II]], from shore bombardment by the United States Navy on July 17, 1945, and in air raids on June 10 and July 19. Hitachi was an important military target, as it was a major industrial center, which containing numerous factories of the Hitachi ''[[zaibatsu]]'', especially connected with the production of electrical equipment. It also had a copper mine that contained 1/10 of all of Japan's copper. Following an air raid on June 10 by the [[USAAF]], which missed the Hitachi factories and burned down much of the civilian residential districts, the city was subjected to shore bombardment on July 19 by the battleships {{USS| Iowa|BB-61}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63}}, and {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificbattleship.com/page/world_war_2#a1945 |title=USS Iowa History – World War II |publisher=Pacific Battleship Center |access-date=September 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226130407/https://www.pacificbattleship.com/page/world_war_2#a1945 |archive-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the bombardment was very inaccurate, and although civilian casualties were very high, the Hitachi factories were again largely left intact. The shore bombardment was followed by a second air raid with incendiary bombs on July 19.

In 1976 the disassembled [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] fighter jet that Soviet pilot [[Viktor Belenko]] had [[Defection of Viktor Belenko|defected]] in was returned to the Soviet Union from the port of Hitachi. It had been extensively examined at the nearby [[Ibaraki Airport|Hyakuri Air Base]].<ref>[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=327520&dt=2082&dl=1345 UNCLAS State Message 239736], U.S. State Department, 27 September 1976.</ref>

The borders of Hitachi expanded in 1955–1956 through the annexation of the neighboring villages of Hidaka, Sakamoto, Higashiosawa, Nakasato, Toyoura, the towns of Taga and Kuji. The Hitachi Copper Mine closed in 1981.

On November 1, 2004, the neighboring town of [[Jūō, Ibaraki|Jūō]] (from [[Taga District, Ibaraki|Taga District]]) was merged into Hitachi.

The city suffered from minor damage in the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] with no fatalities reported.
