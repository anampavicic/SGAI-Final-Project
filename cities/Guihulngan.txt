'''Guihulngan''', officially the '''City of Guihulngan''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Guihulngan}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Guihulngan}}), is a 5th class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Negros Oriental]], Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 102,656 people,{{PH census|current}} the third-most populous city in [[Negros Oriental]] after the cities of [[Dumaguete]] and [[Bayawan]]. Guihulngan is also dubbed by its residents as the "rising city of the north".

Guihulngan is {{convert|116|km}} from [[Dumaguete]].

==Etymology==
There are numerous versions of how the city got its name. According to legend, the first was caused by a river that flowed directly to the town proper from the mainspring at Sitio Anahaw, Barangay Nagsaha, hence the name "''Guipadulngan''," which means the place where the river flows to its end.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GUIHULNGAN CITY – NEGROS ORIENTAL |url=https://dumaguete.com/guihulngan-city-negros-oriental/#google_vignette |access-date=June 21, 2024 |website=dumaguete.com}}</ref>

==History==
Some of the towns of early creation were founded at the close of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Dauin, for example, was founded in 1787, Tayasan, in 1790; Jimalalud, in 1797; ''Guijulñgan'', in 1800; and Bacong, in 1801.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Felipe |first1=Buencamino |title=Census of the Philippine Islands taken under the direction of the Philippine Legislature in the year 1918 |publisher=Publisher Manila, Bureau of printing |oclc=1041773123 }}</ref>

As constituted in 1898, it included the following towns: Amblan, [[Ayungon]], Ayuquitan, [[Bacong]], [[Bais, Negros Oriental|Bais]], Bayanan, Canoan, Dauin, [[Dumaguete]]  (capital), Guijulñgan, [[Manjuyod]], Nueva Valencia, [[Siaton]], [[Tanjay]], [[Tayasan]], Tolon, and [[Zamboanguita]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Felipe |first1=Buencamino |title=Census of the Philippine Islands taken under the direction of the Philippine Legislature in the year 1918 |publisher=Publisher Manila, Bureau of printing |oclc=1041773123 }}</ref>

The second is associated with the gruesome incident in the 19th century when the Philippines was a colony of Spain; men and women of different ages were said to be captured, beheaded and thrown into the sea by the Moros, now known as Tañon Strait. Other accounts claim that the [[Moro people|Moro invaders]] dropped a bell into the sea when they found out that it was used by the lookout to warn the townsfolk of their coming. Since that time, the place has been called ''Guihulugan'' which means, "Place where a thing was dropped". But in the Spanish writing, "U" and "N" are similar, which is why it became commonly written and known as ''Guihulngan''.

Whether it originated as ''Guipadulngan'' or ''Guihulngan'', the name is indeed symbolic, as the town is “dropped” with abundant blessings from the Almighty for a significant "end".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.insidenegros.com/negros-oriental/guihulngan-city/ |title=Guihulngan - Inside Negros |access-date=February 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210161101/http://www.insidenegros.com/negros-oriental/guihulngan-city/ |archive-date=February 10, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 17th century map Murillo-Velarde Map it somewhat appears as ''Dijolongan''.

Three ''[[barrio]]s'' were created in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/14223 |title=Republic Act No. 2498 |date=June 21, 1959 |website=Supreme Court E-Library |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 15, 2024}}</ref>

'''History of the Villegas Clan''' 

Don Jose Villegas, a Chinese mestizo merchant from Dumanjug, Cebu, was driven by ambition and vision. In the early 1800s, he grew up in a bustling coastal town, learning trade from his father. His business acumen led him to Guihulngan on Negros Island, where he built a successful enterprise and became a respected community figure. His philanthropic efforts further cemented his legacy.

Don Jose's family continued his legacy. His descendants, including Pelagio Vergara Villegas, married Agapita Silva, and their children became prominent figures in Negros Oriental. Notable family members include Esperidion, Simplicio, Restituto, and Constancio Villegas, who held various political positions. Their contributions extended through multiple generations, including mayors, congressmen, and judges.

The family of Dominga Vergara Villegas, married to Don Pedro Cirilo Laguda Hermoso, is historically significant due to its ties to Visayan hero Don Deigo de la Vina . Their lineage, including Pedro Vicente Hermoso married to  Milagros “Isang “ Geopano , contributed notably to their communities, intertwining with the region's heroic legacy.

Siblings Pelagio, Dominga, and Pedro Vergara Villegas significantly impacted their communities. Pelagio and Pedro were local heroes in Guihulngan, while Dominga's family legacy gave colorful footprints in the community .

The Villegas family's heritage intertwined with historical events, notably through connections to heroes like Pantaleon "Leon Kilat" Villegas, a revolutionary leader. Their story reflects a rich legacy of entrepreneurship,sugar industry , public service, and resilience in the Philippines.'''Historical Notes from Family Historian Franco R. Villegas and Prof. Penn T. Larena'''

On July 14, 2007, Guihulngan becomes a city in the province of Negros Oriental through ratification of Republic Act 9409 which was approved last March 24.<ref name=vds>{{ cite web |url=http://www.visayandailystar.com/archives.visayandailystar.com/2007/July/17/negor2.htm |title=Guihulgnan becomes sixth city of NegOr |first=Juancho |last=Gallarde |publisher=Visayan Daily Star |date=July 17, 2007 |access-date=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] declared the cityhood law of Guihulngan and 15 other cities unconstitutional after a petition filed by the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] in its ruling on November 18, 2008. On December 22, 2009, the cityhood law of Guihulngan and 15 other municipalities regain its status as cities again after the court reversed its ruling on November 18, 2008. On August 23, 2010, the court reinstated its ruling on November 18, 2008, causing Guihulngan and 15 cities to become regular municipalities. Finally, on February 15, 2011, Guihulngan becomes a city again including the 15 municipalities declaring that the conversion to cityhood met all legal requirements.

After six years of legal battle, in its board resolution, the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Guihulngan and 15 other cities.

==Geography==
Guihulngan is located in the northern part of the province on the coast of [[Tañon Strait]].

===Barangays===
[[File:Inbound4333816410537120824.jpg|thumb|220px|Barangay Hibaiyo landscape]]
Guihulngan is politically subdivided into 33 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].
