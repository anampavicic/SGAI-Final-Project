Before the city was founded in 1567,<ref name=":0">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carácas}}</ref> the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. [[Francisco Fajardo]], the son of a Spanish [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] and a [[Guaiqueri]] ''[[cacique|cacica]]'', who came from [[Margarita Island|Margarita]], began establishing settlements in the area of [[La Guaira]] and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by [[Terepaima National Park|Terepaima]] and [[Guaicaipuro]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Ferry|first=Robert J.|title=The colonial elite of early Caracas: formation & crisis, 1567–1767|publisher=University of California Press|year=1989|isbn=0-585-28540-3|location=Berkeley, Calif.|oclc=45728929}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Layrisse|first1=Miguel|last2=Wilbert|first2=Johannes|last3=Arends|first3=Tulio|date=1958|title=Frequency of blood group antigens in the descendants of Guayquerí Indians|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=16|issue=3|pages=307–318|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330160304|pmid=13649899|issn=0002-9483}}</ref> Fajardo's 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodríguez de Suárez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last1=Straka|first1=Tomás|title=Historical dictionary of Venezuela|last2=Guzmán Mirabal|first2=Guillermo|last3=Cáceres|first3=Alejandro E.|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|others=Rudolph, Donna Keyse|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5381-0949-6|edition=Third|location=Lanham|oclc=993810331}}</ref> The eventual settlers of Caracas came from [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]], the German capital of their [[Klein-Venedig]] colony around the present-day coastal [[Colombia–Venezuela border]]; from the 1540s, the colony had been ''de facto'' controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including [[Barquisimeto]] and [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]] before reaching the Caracas valley.<ref name=":1" />

On 25 July 1567, Captain [[Diego de Losada]] laid the foundations of the city of ''Santiago de León de Caracas''.<ref name=":0" /> De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them.<ref name=":3" /> The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town's population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.<ref name=":1" />

In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Venezuela Province]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McCudden|first=Mary Rose|title=Britannica Student Encyclopedia : an A to Z Encyclopedia|date=May 2014|isbn=978-1-62513-172-0|location=[Chicago, Illinois]|pages=36|oclc=882262198}}</ref> under the province's new governor, [[Juan de Pimentel]] (1576–1583).<ref name=":3" /> In the 1580s, Caraqueños started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire's trade circuit.<ref name=":1" />

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the [[Cordillera de la Costa Central|Central Range]] as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements,<ref name=":1" /> but in 1595 the [[Preston–Somers expedition]] landed and around 200 English [[Privateer]]s, including [[George Somers]] and [[Amyas Preston]], crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation.<ref>John Lombardi, ''Venezuela'', Oxford, England, 1982, p. 72.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas|title=George Somers, Amyas Preston and the Burning of Caracas|work=The Bermudian |access-date  = 17 May 2016 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513110245/http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas |archive-date = 13 May 2016 |url-status     = dead}}</ref> The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and "a lot of sacrifice".<ref name=":3" /> In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that [[Cacao bean]]s could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the [[Caribbean]]. The city became important in the [[Viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]], as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an ''alhorra'' blight, the [[Mexican Inquisition]] of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in [[Guayaquil]] greatly affected the market. This and the destructive [[1641 Caracas earthquake|1641 earthquake]] put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the [[Dutch Empire]], which Caraqueños later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through [[Curaçao]].<ref name=":1" />

[[File:Vista de Caracas en 1839.jpg|thumb|left|Caracas in 1839]]
In 1728, the [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]] was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Nueva Granada]], corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province. [[Luis de Unzaga]] created the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]] in the summer of 1777, with Caracas as the capital.<ref name=":3" /> Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 [[Gual and España conspiracy]], based in Caracas,<ref name="The connection">{{cite web|title=The Connection between the United States Independence and the Hispanic American Independence Movement, and the Role Played by Some Key Books Published at the Beginning of the XIX Century|url=http://allanbrewercarias.net/Content/449725d9-f1cb-474b-8ab2-41efb849fea2/Content/I,%201,%201045.%20Brewer.%20THE%20ROLE%20OF%20SOME%20KEY%20BOOKS%20IN%20THE%20CONECTION%20BETWEEN%20THE%20U.S.%20INDEPENDENCE%20AND%20THE%20SPANISH.pdf|website=allanbrewercarias.net|access-date=29 July 2019|archive-date=17 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717114346/http://allanbrewercarias.net/Content/449725d9-f1cb-474b-8ab2-41efb849fea2/Content/I,%201,%201045.%20Brewer.%20THE%20ROLE%20OF%20SOME%20KEY%20BOOKS%20IN%20THE%20CONECTION%20BETWEEN%20THE%20U.S.%20INDEPENDENCE%20AND%20THE%20SPANISH.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> and then the successful 1811 [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]].<ref name=":3" /> Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an [[1812 Caracas earthquake|earthquake destroyed Caracas]], a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] continued until 24 June 1821, when [[Simón Bolívar]] defeated [[royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalists]] in the [[Battle of Carabobo]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name="HT">Maurice Wiesenthal, ''The History and Geography of a Valley'', 1981.</ref> Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]]: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.<ref name=":3" />

Caracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=":3" /> Cultural landmarks, like the [[University City of Caracas]], designed by modernist architect [[Carlos Raúl Villanueva]] and declared a World Heritage Site by [[UNESCO]] in 2000;<ref name=":23">{{cite web|title=Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/986|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=28 May 2010|archive-date=22 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422045201/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/986|url-status=live}}</ref> the [[Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art]]; and the [[Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex]] were built, as well as the [[Caracas Metro]] and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the [[1980s oil glut]] and political instability like the [[Caracazo]], meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the [[Crisis in Venezuela]]. By 2017, Caracas was the most violent city in the world.<ref name=":3" />

== Geography ==
[[File:Parque del Este - Caracas.JPG|thumb|View of Ávila from [[Parque del Este]]]]
Caracas is contained entirely within a valley of the [[Cordillera de la Costa Central|Venezuelan Central Range]], and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly {{convert|15|km|0|adj=on|sp=us}} expanse of [[El Ávila National Park]]. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between {{convert|870|and|1,043|m|ft|sp=us}} [[above sea level]]; the historic center lies at about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level.<ref name=mountains>{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=James J.|year=1982|title=The Northern Andean Environment|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=2|issue=3|pages=253–264|doi=10.2307/3673089|jstor=3673089}}</ref> This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=A.S.|year=1978|title=Urban Growth Patterns in Latin America with Illustrations from Caracas|journal=Urban Studies|volume=15|issue=3|pages=299–312|doi=10.1080/713702382|bibcode=1978UrbSt..15..299M |s2cid=153430807|issn=0042-0980}}</ref> The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the ''Pico El Ávila'', which rises to {{convert|2159|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.<ref name="mountains" />

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Caracas has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw''), but also exhibits traits of a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb'') due to its elevated location within the [[Venezuelan Coastal Range|Venezuelan Coastal Range (Maritime Andes)]]. Caracas precipitation varies between {{convert|900|and|1,300|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} (annual), in the city proper to {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are cooler compared to other locations with a typical tropical savanna climate. The annual average temperature is approximately {{convert|23.4|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with the average of the coldest month (January) {{convert|21.7|°C|0|abbr=on}} and the average of the warmest month (May) {{convert|24.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of {{convert|2.8|C-change|abbr=on}}.<ref name="climate" />

=== Hydrography ===

The hydrographic network of the city of Caracas is made up of the Guaire river basin which is a sub-basin of the Tuy river. This basin crosses the valley where the city is located from West to East (Las Adjuntas – [[Petare]]). It covers about 655 square kilometers, about 45&nbsp;km. long and about 15&nbsp;km. wide, has a rectangular shape. The basin is formed by the Caracas Valley, which is relatively high, narrow and long, surrounded by the high and steep Cordillera de la Costa, which runs parallel to the Litoral.

Among the characteristics of the hydrographic network associated with the city of Caracas is the high degree of contamination present in the lower parts of the [[Guaire River]] due to its tributaries having been used for sewage collection since 1874, during the government of Antonio Guzmán Blanco, until today. The level of contamination is such that it does not allow the maintenance of the life of the species that once populated the basin, and it has become extinct or has been restricted to the highest areas of the basin, mainly within the boundaries of the national park. Avila. Awareness for the recovery of the basin has recently begun, however, much remains to be done before results can be observed.

Among the main rivers and streams that make up the basin are in its northern slope: San Pedro River, Macarao River, Quebrada Caroata, Catuche River, Anauco River, Chacaito River, Tocome River, Caurimare River; on its southern slope we find that among the main [[tributaries]] are: El Valle river, Quebrada Baruta and Quebrada La Guairita. In the upper part of the basin there are two reservoirs with the purpose of supplying water to the western part of the city; These are the Macarao Dam and the La Mariposa Reservoir.

== Urbanism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}
[[File:AvilaNationalPark201603.jpg|thumb|View of Caracas from the Avila National Park]]
Caracas shares commonalities with many [[Latin American]] cities: densely populated and with limited space because it is surrounded by mountains. Because of this, the city has grown vertically. A very striking aspect is the number of people living in substandard housing built on the mountain slopes surrounding the city. This type of housing is called ranchos, built improvised, without any official planning, with deficiencies and inadequate materials, marking a difference between those who live in the valley proper, 45% of the population in 25% of the urban area lives in these settlements.

The city center, developed around a small historic center, represents less than a quarter of the total area of the city, which has spread along the valley and has also been connected in recent years with satellite cities in the states of Miranda and La Guaira, creating a major metropolitan area known as Gran Caracas. The city's rapid population growth has resulted in increasing [[traffic congestion]]. To this end, the subway transportation system (Metro de Caracas) has been progressively expanded and is currently linked to the Los Teques Metro and, in the future, to the Guarenas-Guatire Metro system. The "Ezequiel Zamora" Central Railway System also links the communities of Charallave and Cúa de los Valles del Tuy with the subway transportation of the capital city.

Some areas of the city have a grid layout, either inherited from the [[colony]] or developed during the urban projects of the 20th century. Other areas, built on the mountain slopes, do not follow this pattern, but adapt to the irregularities of the terrain. These elevated areas enjoy a temperate temperature throughout the year.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Av Bolivar caracas2.jpg|thumb|left|Bolivar Avenue]]
According to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9&nbsp;million inhabitants,<ref name="ine.gov.ve">{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gov.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/distrito_capital.pdf|title=Archived copy |access-date=30 April 2010 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009164814/http://www.ine.gov.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/distrito_capital.pdf|archive-date=9 October 2012}}</ref> while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9&nbsp;million {{As of|2011|lc=y}}. The majority of the population is [[Mixed Race|mixed-race]], typically with varying degrees of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]], [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and occasional [[Ethnic groups in Asia|Asian]] ancestry. There is a noteworthy [[Afro-Venezuelan]] community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, [[Serbs]], Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people.<ref name="ine.gov.ve" /><ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.ine.gov.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/miranda.pdf Censo Nacional] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114144253/http://www.ine.gov.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/miranda.pdf |date=14 November 2020 }} Deciembre 2014</ref> In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly-planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rethinking the informal city : critical perspectives from Latin America|date=2010|publisher=Berghahn Books|last1=Hernández|first1=Felipe|last2=Kellett|first2=Peter William|last3=Allen|first3=Lea K.|isbn=978-1-84545-972-7|location=New York|oclc=647933862|page=119}}</ref>

Caracas has exceeded the administrative limits of its perimeter due to accelerated population growth, so that its most suitable demographic study territory is the Metropolitan District or AMC. According to 2011 calculations by the National Institute of Statistics, the metropolitan city had a population for the 2011 census of 2,923,959 inhabitants. The Metropolitan District represents less than 1% of the national territory and is home to one-fifteenth of the total population of the country. In percentage numbers, 9.2% of the nation's total population lives in the five capital municipalities, out of the 335 municipalities that comprise the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

The region is called Greater Caracas or Metropolitan Region of Caracas (RMC) satellite cities or adjacent bedrooms: the Altos Mirandinos, the Central Coast of La Guaira, Guarenas, Guatire and the Valles del Tuy. This agglomeration had an estimated population of 4.3 million inhabitants in 2011.

In the 20th century, an exodus of the peasantry to the capital and other cities intensified, motivated by a search for improvements in their quality of life. This led to depopulation of the rural areas of the country and the demographic saturation of the centers. This saturation caused the expansion of marginal areas on the outskirts of the city; however, the lowest unemployment rates in the entire country correspond precisely to the metropolitan area of Caracas. In 1936, the total population of Venezuela had been equal to the estimated population of Greater Caracas for the year 2000: almost 4 million inhabitants. From 1936 to 1990, Caracas multiplied its population, although far less than any other major city in the country, such as Valencia, which in the same period of time multiplied its population almost 25 times.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Between the 1940s and 1950s, after the Second World War, a growing wave of [[European immigrants]] began, mostly Spanish, Portuguese and Italians and in other magnitudes, communities of Germans (Colonia Tovar), French, English, [[Serbs]] and Jews were established.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} New developments in Caracas were populated mainly by these European immigrants, such as La Florida and [[Altamira, Caracas|Altamira]].
During the 1960s, President Rómulo Betancourt followed the same policy as the Marcos Pérez Jiménez government: promoting immigration, especially from Latin America and from other parts of the world. These policies were maintained until the late 1980s, with a notable influx of Argentines, Uruguayans, Chileans, Cubans, Peruvians, Ecuadorians, Chinese, and Arabs. Towards the beginning of the 1980s, immigration was marked by a strong exodus of Colombians.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

The multiethnic, cultural and racial mix has marked the city throughout history. Its ethnic composition is very diverse.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Centro Histórico de Caracas.jpg|thumb|left|Historic center of Caracas]]
In 2013, the [[World Economic Forum]] evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.<ref name=tourism2013>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TT_Competitiveness_Report_2013.pdf|title=The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013|last1=Blanke|first1=Jennifer|last2=Chiesa|first2=Thea|publisher=World Economic Forum|year=2013|access-date=17 May 2020|archive-date=5 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105024651/http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TT_Competitiveness_Report_2013.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5&nbsp;million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8&nbsp;million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6&nbsp;million bolivars.<ref name="tourism2013" /> The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.<ref>MARTÍNEZ RODRÍGUEZ, M. (2013). Venezuela: un destino nada chévere. Debates IESA, 18(4), 73–75.</ref>

== Government ==
On 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in ''Gaceta Official'' N° 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador]], [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]], [[Baruta Municipality|Baruta]], [[Sucre Municipality, Miranda|Sucre]], and [[El Hatillo Municipality, Miranda|El Hatillo]] municipalities would be delegated to the ''Alcaldía Mayor'', physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldfrank|first1=Benjamin|title=Deepening Local Democracy in Latin America: Participation, Decentralization, and the Left|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-07451-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AqJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|language=en|page=190|access-date=6 June 2017|archive-date=15 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415113259/https://books.google.com/books?id=_AqJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|url-status=live}}</ref> The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ANC aprobó supresión y liquidación del Área Metropolitana de Caracas|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/gobierno/anc-aprobo-supresion-liquidacion-del-area-metropolitana-caracas_216247|access-date=21 April 2018|publisher=El Nacional|date=20 December 2017|language=es|archive-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143433/http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/gobierno/anc-aprobo-supresion-liquidacion-del-area-metropolitana-caracas_216247|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Capital District ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}
In the case of the Libertador Municipality of Caracas, the only member of the Capital District, the [[Executive Power|executive]] authority rests with the Head of Government of the Capital District, a position designated by the President of the Republic.

According to Article 3 of the Capital District Law, the legislative function is exercised directly by the Republic through the National Assembly of Venezuela.

{{Quote box
| align = center
| width = 800px
| quote = Article 3. The special regime of the Capital District is a government system constituted by an executive body exercised by a Head of Government, and the legislative function will be in charge of the National Assembly.
}}

Before the creation of the Metropolitan District, the Federal District (current Capital District) had a governor appointed by the President of the Republic, while the Caracas municipalities of the State of Miranda governed with their respective mayors in isolation, without any coordinating entity. In April 2009, the National Assembly reformed the Capital District Law, legalizing the constitution of a Head of Government or Governor for the Libertador municipality designated by the National Executive.

Using as an argument what is established in article 156 of the constitution:

{{Quote box
| align = center
| width = 800px
| quote = Article 156. It is the competence of the National Public Power: 10. The organization and regime of the Capital District and federal dependencies.
}}

=== Metropolitan District ===
[[File:Tricolor.jpg|upright|thumb|Federal Legislative Palace, Seat of the National Parliament]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}
The city of Caracas occupies the entirety of the Libertador municipality of the Capital District and part of the state of Miranda, specifically the municipalities of Baruta, Chacao, El Hatillo and Sucre, which until 2011 formed the Metropolitan District of Caracas, which enjoyed legal personality and autonomy within the limits of the Constitution and the law.

Until that year, the Metropolitan Mayor was the first civil, political and administrative authority of the city of Caracas, as well as the municipal mayors in each of the municipalities comprising it. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was organized in a system of municipal government at two levels: the metropolitan or district and the municipalities.

== Transport ==
[[File:Iafetren.JPG|thumb|Railway Caracas – Cúa]]

The [[Caracas Metro]] has been in operation since 27 March 1983, with four lines, 47 stations and about 10 more to be constructed. It covers a great part of the city and also has an integrated ticket system that combines the route of the ''Metro'' with those offered by the ''Metrobús'', a bus service of the Caracas Metro. In 2010, the first segment of a new aerial cable car system opened, [[Metrocable (Caracas)|Metrocable]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanrail.net/am/cara/pix/caracas-gallery5.htm|title=Caracas Metro Cable|website=www.urbanrail.net|access-date=4 April 2013|archive-date=13 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513015219/http://www.urbanrail.net/am/cara/pix/caracas-gallery5.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> which feeds into the larger metro system.

Buses are the main means of [[Public transport|mass transportation]]. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the ''Metrobús''. Other transportation services include the [[Instituto Autónomo de Ferrocarriles del Estado|IFE]] train to and from the Tuy Valley cities of [[Charallave]] and [[Cúa]]; the [[Simón Bolívar International Airport (Venezuela)|Simón Bolívar International Airport]], the biggest and most important in the country; the metro additional services [[Caracas Aerial Tramway]] and [[Los Teques Metro]] (connecting Caracas with the suburban city of [[Los Teques]]); and the [[Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base]] used by military aviation and government airplanes.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Highways and main roads ===
The largest concentration of road networks in the country is in the Caracas region and its surroundings, with a large network of highways and avenues in the Metropolitan District and urban, suburban and interurban roads. The road network has become a great crossroads between the West, the East and the Center of the country. Not very advantageous role for a city saturated with population and vehicles of all kinds, both from the same city and from its immediate area of influence (La Guaira State, Valles del Tuy, Guarenas-Guatire, Altos Mirandinos) and from other areas of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Currently, a link is being built that will connect the Central Regional highway (at km 31) with the Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho highway (Kempis sector), in order to serve as a spillway to the city of Caracas and neighboring Guarenas and Guatire, so that vehicles that go from east to west or center, and vice versa, do not have the need to enter Caracas. The route of this highway would be from the vicinity of the Charallave airport, passing through Santa Lucía and going up to the Kempis area (between Guatire and Caucagua).{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Traffic in the Caracas Region is very congested, since it is the city with the largest number of cars in the country, causing traffic jams at any time in the city and being over-saturated at peak hours, where Caracas residents last up to 3 hours to get out of congestion.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Since 1986 a mysterious black substance referred to as [[La Mancha Negra|La Mancha Negra (The Black Stain)]] has oozed from roads has caused many car accidents killing multiple people.<ref>{{cite news|last1=González|first1=Aliana|title=La Guillotina Espera en la Autopista|work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|date=22 January 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blob of sticky goo spreading on roads terrifies Venezuelan drivers|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/1992/08/30/blob-of-sticky-goo-spreading-on-roads-terrifies-venezuelan-drivers/|access-date=19 July 2015|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=30 August 1992|archive-date=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722031510/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-08-30/news/1992243008_1_blob-mancha-negra-caracas|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Caracas metro ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}
[[File:Estacion Coche L3 METRO DE CARACAS.JPG|thumb|Coche Station, Caracas Metro]]

It is one of the most important means of transportation in the city, since its 47 operating stations transport about 2 million people, according to official figures83 The Caracas Metro system covers the central area of the city from east to west, with lines that connect the southwest and with other surface systems of the Metro system (BusCaracas, MetroCable San Agustín) as well as the southeast (Cabletrén de Petare, Metrocable Mariche), Metrobús feeder routes in most of the stations, in addition to the expansion of lines existing stations (La Rinconada terminal station of line 3 and intermediate stations of the extension; interconnection of the Plaza Venezuela and Capuchinos stations – extension of line 2, better known as line 4, as well as the future interconnection with the Metro Guarenas Guatire system, which began with the Bello Monte station) and an appendix that extends to the city of Los Teques (capital of the Miranda state). The three stations that comprise this last line make up the Los Teques Metro System86. Both systems are operated by the company C. A. Metro de Caracas (Cametro)

The system inaugurated in 1983 has 71&nbsp;km and with five lines, being one of the longest in Latin America and expansions of it are being built towards the towns of Guarenas and Guatire. The expansion plans also include the extension to the Baruta and Hatillo municipalities, as well as other metrocable systems in the city center.

=== BusCaracas ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}

BusCaracas is a [[mass transit system]] that connects some areas of the Libertador municipality of Caracas. It began operations in October 201290, taking as a model other means of transportation such as the Trolemérida, and Transbarca. The work was undertaken by the Government of Venezuela through the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MOPVI), the company in charge of the construction was VIALPA, until its contract was cancelled and replaced by PILPERCA in 2010, and inaugurated on 3 October 2012. Also known as Line 7 of the Caracas subway has 11 stations with two connections to the subway system at La Hoyada and La bandera, lines 1 and 3 respectively.

=== Metrocable ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}
[[File:Teleferico waraira repano caracas.JPG|thumb|Caracas Metrocable]]

The Caracas Metrocable is a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] system integrated into the Caracas Metro, conceived in such a way that residents of Caracas neighborhoods usually located in mountainous areas can travel faster and safer to the city center. It works like a feeder route in the style of the metrobus.

In 2011, a new metrocable system was built in the Parroquia de San Agustín del Sur, where people can freely go and enjoy a view of a large part of Caracas.

=== Rail system ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}

There is a national railway project, which aims to connect Caracas with the central area of the country. Currently, the Caracas-[[Cúa]] train service is operating, belonging to the Central Railway System of Venezuela "Ezequiel Zamora I". Inaugurated in 2006, it is the only railway section currently operating in Venezuela, according to the Instituto de Ferrocarriles del Estado (IFE). This commuter train line connects the city of Caracas with the towns of the [[Valles del Tuy]] (Charallave, Santa Lucía, Ocumare, Santa Teresa, Yare and Cúa) and runs for 41.4 kilometers.

The network begins its journey at the Libertador Simón Bolivar station in Caracas, located in La Rinconada and connected to line 3 of the Caracas metro. From the city it communicates with three other stations: Charallave Norte Francisco de Miranda and Charallave Sur Don Simón Rodríguez; both in the town of Charallave and ends at the Cúa General Ezequiel Zamora station (Cúa, [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]]).
