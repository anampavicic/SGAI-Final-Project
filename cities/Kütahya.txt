==History==

===Bronze Age===
Although the exact date of its establishment cannot be determined, its history dates back to 3000 BC . According to old sources, the ancient name of Kütahya was Kotiaeon, Cotiaeum and Koti. The oldest people to settle in the province were the Phrygians . The Phrygians , who came to Anatolia in 1200 BC , entered the lands of the Hittite Empire and organized as a state.

===Iron Age===
In 676 BC , the Cimmerians defeated the Phrygian King Midas III and dominated Kütahya and its surroundings.
During the time when Alyattes was the King of Lydia, the Cimmerian rule was replaced by the Lydian rule. In 546 BC, the Persians defeated the Lydian Army and invaded Anatolia. In 334 BC, Alexander, who defeated the Persians near the Biga River, established dominance in the region. With the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Kütahya and its region passed to one of his commanders, Antigonos. In 133 BC , it came under Roman rule. It was made a bishopric center.

===Ancient Greece, Rome, and Byzantium===

The ancient world knew present-day Kütahya as Cotyaeum (Κοτύαιον). It became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Phrygia Salutaris]],<ref>Heinrich Gelzer, [https://archive.org/stream/abhandlungenbay06klasgoog#page/n579/mode/1up ''Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum''], in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1901, p. 540, nº 338.</ref> but in about 820 became the capital of the new province of Phrygia Salutaris III. 

====Church history====
Its bishopric thus changed from being a [[suffragan]] of [[Synnada in Phrygia| Synnada]] to a [[metropolitan see]], although with only three suffragan sees according to the ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo VI the Wise]] (886-912), which is dated to around 901–902.<ref>Gelzer, ''op. cit.'', p. 559, nnº 650-653.</ref> According to the 6th-century historian [[John Malalas]], [[Cyrus of Panopolis]], who had been prefect of the city of Constantinople, was sent there as bishop by Emperor [[Theodosius II]] (408-50), after four bishops of the city had been killed. (Two other sources make Cyrus bishop of [[Smyrna]] instead.{{cn|date=March 2020}}) The bishopric of Cotyaeum was headed in 431 by Domnius, who attended the [[Council of Ephesus]], and in 451 by Marcianus, who was at the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. A source cited by [[Le Quien]] says that a bishop of Cotyaeum named Eusebius was at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553. Cosmas was at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 680–681. Ioannes, a deacon, represented an unnamed bishop of Cotyaeum at the [[Trullan Council]] in 692. Bishop Constantinus was at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 692, and Bishop Anthimus at the [[Photius| Photian]] [[Council of Constantinople (879)]],<ref>{{Oriens christianus|volume= 1|at= coll. 851-852}}</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v.

====Justinian fortifications====
Under the reign of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] the town was fortified with a double-line of walls and citadel.

===Seljuk, Crusader and Ottoman periods===
====Political history, 11th century-1867====
In 1071 Cotyaeum (or Kotyaion) briefly fell to the [[Seljuk Turks]], later being recaptured by the Byzantine’s. It was again captured by the Seljuks in the 1180’s and changed hands several more times, being captured by the [[Germiyanid]]s, [[Timur-Leng]] (Tamerlane), until finally being incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1428.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.turkeyforyou.com/turkey_kutahya_history|title= History of Kutahya}}</ref> It was initially the center of [[Anatolia Eyalet]] till 1827, when the [[Hüdavendigâr Eyalet]] was formed. It was later center of the sancak within the borders of the [[Hüdavendigâr Vilayet]] in 1867. Troops of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] briefly occupied it in 1833.

====Armenian ceramics====
During this time a large number of Christian [[Armenians]] settled in Kotyaion/Kütahya, where they came to dominate the tile-making and ceramic-ware production.<ref>[[Richard G. Hovannisian|Hovannisian, Richard G.]] and Armen Manuk-Khaloyan, "The Armenian Communities of Asia Minor," in ''Armenian Communities of Asia Minor'', ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. UCLA Armenian History and Culture Series: Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces, 13. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 2014, pp. 32-34.</ref> Kütahya emerged as a renowned center for the Ottoman ceramic industry, producing tiles and [[faience]] for mosques, churches, and official buildings in places all over the [[Middle East]].<ref>See Dickran Kouymjian, "The Role of Armenian Potters of Kutahia in the Ottoman Ceramic Industry," in ''Armenian Communities of Asia Minor'', pp. 107-30.</ref> The craft industry of [[Armenian ceramics in Jerusalem]] was started by Armenian ceramicist {{ill|David Ohannessian|he|דוד אוהנסיאן}}, master of a Kütahya workshop between 1907 and 1915, who was deported from Kütahya in early 1916, during the [[Armenian genocide]], and rediscovered, living as a refugee in Aleppo in 1918, by Sir [[Mark Sykes]], a former patron. Sykes connected him to the new military governor of Jerusalem, [[Sir Ronald Storrs]], and arranged for Ohannessian to travel to Jerusalem to participate in a planned British restoration of the [[Dome of the Rock]].<ref>Moughalian, Sato. ''Feast of Ashes: The Life and Art of David Ohannessian''. Stanford, CA: Redwood Press, 2019.</ref>

Today two families originating from Kutahya, the Balian and Karakashian families continue the tradition of Armenian Ceramics in East Jerusalem. The Balian studio is known underthe name the [https://armenianceramics.com Armenian Ceramics -Balian] and that is where the late [[Marie Balian]] transformed the art of ceramic tile murals to a much higher level of art than imagined.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

====Fortifications====
The fortifications of the city and its environs, which were vital to the security and economic prosperity of the region, were built and rebuilt from antiquity through the Ottoman period.<ref name="foss">{{cite book|last1= Foss|first1= Clive| title= Survey of the Medieval Castles of Anatolia: Kütahya| date= 1985|publisher= BAR| location= Oxford, U.K.|pages= 12ff}}</ref> However, the dates assigned to the many periods of construction and the assessment of the military architecture are open to various interpretations.<ref>Edwards, Robert W., “Medieval Castles of Anatolia: Kütahya,” ''Speculum'' 62 (1987): pp. 675-680.</ref>

====Late 19th-early 20th century history====
At the end of the nineteenth century the population of the [[kaza]] of Kütahya numbered 120,333, of which 4,050 were [[Greeks]], 2,533 [[Armenians]], 754 [[Catholics]], and the remainder [[Turkish people|Turks]] and other Muslim ethnicities.<ref name="Hov and Man">Hovannisian and Manuk-Khaloyan, "The Armenian Communities of Asia Minor," p. 34.</ref> Kütahya and the district itself were spared the ravages of the [[Armenian genocide]] of 1915, when the Ottoman governor, Faruk Ali Bey, went to extreme lengths to protect the Armenian population from being uprooted and sent away on death marches.<ref name="Hov and Man"/> However, Faruk Ali Bey was removed from office in March 1916, and the city's Armenian community suffered in the aftermath under the rule of his successor, Ahmet Mufti Bey. Kütahya was occupied by the [[Greek Army]] on 17 July 1921 after [[Battle of Kütahya–Eskişehir]] during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and was then captured in ruins by the [[Turkish Army]] after the [[Battle of Dumlupınar]] during the [[Great Offensive]] on 30 August 1922.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ole-nikolajsen.com/TURKISH%20FORCES%202004/indwar.pdf|title=Gamblers on Turkish Brink}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/kutahya.htm|title=Kütahya|date=11 January 2022 }}</ref>

The industries of Kütahya have long traditions, going back to ancient times. 

Kütahya is famous for its [[kiln]] products, such as [[tiles]] and [[pottery]], which are glazed and multicoloured.<ref>[[Henry Glassie]], ''Turkish Traditional Art Today'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1993, pp. 435 ff.</ref> Modern industries are [[sugar]] refining, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], [[nitrate]] processing and different products of [[meerschaum]], which is extracted nearby. 

In the Ottoman period, Kütahya was a major cotton production center of the empire.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chen |first=Yuan Julian |date=2021-10-11 |title=Between the Islamic and Chinese Universal Empires: The Ottoman Empire, Ming Dynasty, and Global Age of Explorations |url=https://www.academia.edu/59068575 |journal=Journal of Early Modern History |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=422–456 |doi=10.1163/15700658-bja10030 |s2cid=244587800 |issn=1385-3783}}</ref> Modern local agricultural industry produces [[cereals]], [[fruits]] and [[sugar beet]]. In addition [[livestock|stock]] raising is of much importance. Not far from Kütahya there are important [[mining|mines]] extracting [[lignite]].

Kütahya is linked by rail and road with [[Balıkesir]] {{convert|250|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the west, İstanbul 360km to the northwest, [[Konya]] {{convert|450|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the southeast, [[Eskişehir]] {{convert|70|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northeast and [[Ankara]] {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east.

===Traditional ceramics===
A small [[ewer]], now in the [[British Museum]], gave its name to a category of similar blue and white [[fritware]] pottery known as 'Abraham of Kütahya ware'. It has an inscription in [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] under the glaze on its base stating that it commemorated Abraham of Kütahya with a date of 1510.<ref name="BritMus">'Abraham of Kütahya' ewer, British Museum Accession Code: [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=236618&partid=1 G.1]</ref> In 1957 Arthur Lane published an influential article in which he reviewed the history of pottery production in the region and proposed that 'Abraham of Kütahya' ware was produced from 1490 until around 1525, 'Damascus' and 'Golden Horn' ware were produced from 1525 until 1555 and 'Rhodian' ware from around 1555 until the demise of the [[İznik pottery]] industry at the beginning of the 18th century. This chronology has been generally accepted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Iznik: The Pottery of Ottoman Turkey |author1=Nurhan Atasoy |author2= Julian Raby|editor= Yanni Petsopoulos |year=1989 |location=London |publisher=Alexandria Press |isbn=978-1-85669-054-6 }}</ref>
