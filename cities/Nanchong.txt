'''Nanchong''' ({{zh| c=南充 | p=Nánchōng | w=Nan-ch'ung}}; [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]]: lan<sup>2</sup>cong<sup>1</sup>) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in the northeast of [[Sichuan]] province, China, with an area of {{convert|12479.96|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |language=zh-cn |url=http://www.xzqh.org/QUHUA/51sc/13nanchong.htm |script-title=zh:南充市 |publisher=XZQH |access-date=2008-05-17 |archive-date=2008-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518185411/http://www.xzqh.org/QUHUA/51sc/13nanchong.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the 2020 census it was home to 5,607,565 people, of whom 1,936,534 lived in the built-up (or 'metro') area made of three urban districts. It is the second most populated city of Sichuan Province, after Chengdu. The administrative center is [[Shunqing District]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=南充市第七次全国人口普查公报-南充市人民政府 |trans-title=Nanchong Seventh National Population Census Bulletin-Nanchong Municipal People's Government |url=https://www.nanchong.gov.cn/zwgk/sjfb/tjgb_3573/202106/t20210629_696695.html |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=www.nanchong.gov.cn}}</ref>

==History==
Nanchong was in the territory of the state of [[Ba (state)|Ba]] before it was conquered by the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] in 314 BC. The Qin set up an administrative center at [[Langzhong]] City. [[Anhan]] City was established in Shunqinq district at the beginning of the [[Han dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=南充市地情 |trans-title=Nanchong City |url=https://www.scdfz.org.cn/scdqs/sxdq/ncs/content_21748 |website=四川省情网}}</ref>

In 202 BC, [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] instituted the Anhan ({{zh|s=安汉 |t=安漢}}) County in this place. Anhan literally means "to establish or stabilize Han". In 8 AD, the name was changed to Anxin ({{zh|labels=no|c=安新}}) when [[Wang Mang]] seized the throne of the Han dynasty, but it reverted to Anhan in 25 AD. It was again changed to Guozhou ({{zh|labels=no|c=果州 |l=fruit state}}) in 621 AD ([[Tang dynasty]]), and then to Nanchong in 742 AD. The nickname of Nanchong is Guocheng ({{zh|labels=no|c=果城}}), derived from Guozhou.<ref>{{Cite web |title=建制沿革-南充市人民政府 |trans-title=History of Establishment-Nanchong Municipal People's Government |url=https://www.nanchong.gov.cn/zjnc/rwnc/jzyg/t_625506.html |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=www.nanchong.gov.cn}}</ref>

==Geography==
Nanchong is in the northeast of Sichuan Province. To the east of Nanchong is [[Dazhou]], to the west are [[Mianyang]] and [[Suining]], and to the north is [[Guangyuan]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=市情概览-南充市人民政府 |trans-title=Overview-Nanchong Municipal People's Government |url=https://www.nanchong.gov.cn/zjnc/ncgk/sqgl/t_625056.html |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=www.nanchong.gov.cn}}</ref>

The vast majority of this area is hilly. The [[woodland]] coverage is 25%.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=自然资源-南充市人民政府 |trans-title=Natural Resources-Nanchong Municipal People's Government |url=https://www.nanchong.gov.cn/zjnc/ncgk/zrzy/t_625065.html |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=www.nanchong.gov.cn}}</ref>

The [[Jialing River]], a tributary of the [[Yangtze River]], crosses the prefecture from north to south. There are another 30 rivers in the prefecture with a [[drainage basin]] of more than {{convert|30|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=":0" />

Over 70% of the {{convert|1003|mm|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation occurs from May to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from around 9% in December to 47% in August, the city receives only 1,135 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March–April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October–November).

==Demographics==
The [[Han Chinese|Han people]] are the largest ethnic group in this area, contributing to 99.88% of its population; another 48 ethnic groups can be found in the city. Langzhong has a large [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslim community.

As in other cities of China, the population of Nanchong can be divided into two parts: upper urban population and lower rural population. The registered [[urban population]] is about 1.2 million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2022年南充市国民经济和社会发展统计公报-南充市人民政府 |trans-title=2022 Nanchong National Economic and Social Development Statistics Bulletin-Nanchong Municipal People's Government |url=https://www.nanchong.gov.cn/zwgk/sjfb/tjgb_3573/202304/t20230403_1805524.html |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=www.nanchong.gov.cn}}</ref>

Shunqing District, downtown, is the most dense area in Nanchong. At the center of Shunqing District, and the proverbial heart of the city, is Five Star Garden ({{zh|labels=no|s=五星花园}}); a large [[roundabout]] with five exits leading to other sections of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=走进顺庆_顺庆区人民政府 |trans-title=About Shunqing_Shunqing District People's Government |url=https://www.shunqing.gov.cn/zjsq/ |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=www.shunqing.gov.cn}}</ref>

==Economy==

=== Agriculture ===

Agriculture is the pillar of Nanchong's economy, with 80% of Nanchong's population in rural areas and committed to traditional agricultural activities. Nanchong's manufacturing industry also relies on raw materials which are provided by agriculture.

Nanchong's main agricultural product is food. A large quantity of rice, [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[silk worms]], and pork are produced to support related manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncagri.gov.cn/bmzc_s.asp |title=南充农业信息网 |access-date=2009-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211022625/http://ncagri.gov.cn/bmzc_s.asp |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Manufacturing===
Nanchong's main manufacturing outputs are [[petroleum]] products, [[automobiles]] and parts, mechanical equipment, textiles, and building materials.
<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nanchong.gov.cn/article.php?id=769 |title=南充市公众信息网 |access-date=2009-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707040830/http://www.nanchong.gov.cn/article.php?id=769 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Natural resources===
There is a large quantity of [[Petroleum|rock oil]] and [[natural gas]] found in Nanchong, and it has the largest [[slate]] mine in the west of China. The dams on [[Jialing River]] and its branches have a large potential to increase electric power generation. But the largest resource of Nanchong is human: Nanchong is one of the main providers of Chinese cheap [[migrant worker]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=链接导航 |url=http://www.nanchong.gov.cn |title=南充市人民政府 |publisher=Nanchong.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2022-03-23}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[Transportation]] in Nanchong is quite convenient compared with other cities in [[Sichuan]] province because of its extensive express railway network, shipping, and air service.

Nanchong is a [[transport hub]] of the northeast Sichuan Province. It is crossed by the strategic [[China National Highway 318]], built by the Chinese government in the 1930s, and [[China National Highway 212]] and newly built expressways — [[Cheng-Nan]] and [[Nan-Guang]] [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] — which link the city to [[Chengdu]] and another prefecture-level city: [[Guang'an]]. The expressway to [[Chongqing]] is under construction.

The [[Dazhou–Chengdu Railway]] through Nanchong links [[Chengdu]] and [[Dazhou]]. The [[Chongqing–Lanzhou Railway]], in 2015, will link [[Lanzhou]] ([[Gansu]]) and [[Chongqing]], and turn Nanchong into a railway hub in northeast Sichuan province. The Nanchong railway station provides passenger and cargo services to regional and national economic centres such as [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]], Chongqing, [[Wuhan]], Chengdu and [[Shenzhen]].

The old Nanchong airport was built in the 1950s and closed in 2003. The new [[Nanchong Gaoping Airport]] which has capacity to land bigger planes, provides regular air services to [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Kunming]], [[Xi'an]] and [[Sanya]].

Nanchong is suggested as a tradition [[shipping]] hub in ancient times. Ships from Gansu could reach Chongqing along the Jialing river, but the river is not suitable for modern shipping.

==Higher education==
There are five academic institutions in Nanchong that provide higher education.
