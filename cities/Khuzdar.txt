'''Khuzdar''' ({{langx|bal|{{Nastaliq|قصدار}}}}; {{langx|ur|{{Nastaliq|خضدار}}}}, {{IPA-ur|'xʊzd̪ɑːɾ|pron|}}) is a city in the administrative headquarter of [[Khuzdar District]] in the central part of the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan province]] of [[Pakistan]]. Khuzdar is the [[List of cities in Balochistan, Pakistan by population|3rd-largest city]] of the Balochistan province and the [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|48th-largest city of Pakistan]] by population, according to the 2017 census. Historically, Khuzdar was the main city and capital of the [[Jhalawan]] province of the [[Khanate of Kalat]]. From October 1952 to 1955, it became part of the [[Balochistan States Union]]. In 1955, Khuzdar became the capital of the newly formed [[Kalat Division]] before it became a district of its own in 1974.Gresha is the sub tehsil of khuzdar District and its almost 80Km from khuzdar city.<ref>{{cite web |website=High Court of Balochistan |title=History of District |url=https://bhc.gov.pk/district-judiciary/khuzdar/introduction/history }}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, it is the largest [[Brahui language|Brahui-speaking]] city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Province-wise|url=https://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/population/2017/tables/pakistan/Table11n.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Division-wise |url=https://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/population/2017/tables/balochistan/Table11p.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tehsil-wise |url=https://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/population/2017/results/10711.pdf}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The name for the city was originally in the [[Middle Persian]] language, deriving from the Middle Persian word for silk - "qaz", and "dar" which originates from [[Arabic]] meaning "house of" or "seat of"<ref>{{cite web |title=Dar |url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1#Persian}}</ref> - "Qazdar", meaning "place of silk". After the [[Umayyad conquest of Sindh|Islamic conquest of Sindh]] (which included Khuzdar at the time) that solidified the leadership of the area under the [[Muslims]], the name of the city was changed to "Khuzdar". "Khuz" means to  "take firmly" or "retain forever" in [[Arabic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=HERITAGE: THE RUINED FORTS OF KHUZDAR | date=6 October 2019 |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1509245#:~:text=The%20word%20Khuzdar%20has%20been,forever%27%20while%20dar%20means%20place.}}</ref>

==History==

Under the rule of the [[Umayyad caliphate]], the city was the capital of the [[Turan (Sasanian province)|Turan]] province, which was retained administratively from the [[Sasanian Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of District |url=https://bhc.gov.pk/district-judiciary/khuzdar/introduction/history}}</ref> 

Under [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rule a route from [[Iran]] through north-west [[Balochistan]] connected Qandabil, Kalat, Khuzdar, and [[Multan]]. A caravan route connected Khuzdar with [[Sehwan]]. After the decline of Arab rule, [[Sabuktigin]], the founder of the [[Ghaznavid dynasty]], conquered Khuzdar.<ref>{{cite web |title=HERITAGE: THE RUINED FORTS OF KHUZDAR |date=6 October 2019 |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1509245}}</ref>

Khuzdar became the capital of the [[Brahui people|Brahui]] kingdom of [[Makran]].<ref>Risley, Herbert Hope (1903) ''Census of India, 1901. Volume I. India. Ethnographic appendices, being the data upon which the caste chapter of the Report is based'' Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=vyUUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66 page 66], {{OCLC|2196225}}</ref>

In the early 17th century, it was part of the [[Jhalawan|Jhalawan Kingdom]], but it soon fell under the [[Khanate of Kalat]], where it remained until a series of revolts during the reign of [[Khudadad Khan (Kalat)|Khudadad Khan]] (1857–1893). By 1896, after Khudadad's death, the authority of Kalat was restored.<ref>Hughes-Buller, R. (ed.) (1908) ''Imperial gazetteer of India: Provincial Series: Baluchistan'' Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fyG2AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA16 pages 16–17]</ref>

Under a treaty with Kalat, the British appointed a political agent at Khuzdar in 1903. British assistance continued until 1947, after which the area was acceded to Pakistan and became a democracy. When the [[Baluchistan States Union|Balochistan States Union]] became [[Kalat Division]], Khuzdar was established as the divisional headquarters. The [[Divisions of Pakistan|divisional administration of Pakistan]] ended in 2000. Khuzdar was again established as the divisional headquarters in 2009, by the [[Pakistan People's Party]] government.<ref>{{cite web |title=District-Khuzdar |url=https://kalat.balochistan.gov.pk/district-khuzdar/}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Khuzdar is at the apex of a narrow valley at an elevation of {{convert|1237|m|ft}}. Despite this altitude, Khuzdar like most of Balochistan has an [[ semi arid]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') with very low and erratic rainfall. Unlike most parts of the province, the heaviest average rainfall comes from the Asian monsoon in July and August, though this rainfall tends to be very erratic and in many summers there is no significant rain at all.
