==Etymology==
''Naypyidaw'' is [[Burmese language|Burmese]] for "abode of the king", and is generally translated as "royal capital",<ref name=pcgn>[http://www.pcgn.org.uk/Burma%200907.pdf "An Introduction to the Toponymy of Burma (October 2007) – Annex A"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031143028/http://www.pcgn.org.uk/Burma%200907.pdf |date=31 October 2008 }} p. 8, The Permanent Committee on Geographic Names (PCGN), United Kingdom</ref> "seat of the king", or "abode of kings".<ref name=pedrosa/> Traditionally, it was used as a suffix to the names of royal capitals, such as [[Mandalay]], which was called Yattanarbon Naypyidaw ({{my|ရတနာပုံနေပြည်တော်}}).

==History==
Naypyidaw was founded on a [[greenfield site]] near [[Pyinmana]], about {{convert|320|km|mi}} north of the old capital, [[Yangon]]. Construction started in 2002 and was completed by 2012.<ref name="mcc">Marshall Cavendish Corporation (2007). ''World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia.''

On 27 March 2006, more than 12,000 troops marched in the new capital in its first public event: a massive military parade to mark [[Armed Forces Day (Myanmar)|Armed Forces Day]], the anniversary of Burma's 1945 revolution against the [[Japanese occupation of Burma|Japanese occupation]]. Filming was restricted to the concrete parade ground, which contains enormous sculptures of Kings [[Anawrahta]], [[Bayinnaung]] and [[Alaungpaya]]. The city was officially named Naypyidaw<ref name="geomap">{{cite web|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=9355719&fid=713&c=burma#MAP|title=Naypyidaw: Burma|work=Geographical Names|access-date=6 December 2011|archive-date=5 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505060357/http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=9355719&fid=713&c=burma#MAP|url-status=live}}</ref> during these ceremonies,<ref name="bbc4848408">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4848408.stm|title=Burma's new capital stages parade|publisher=BBC News|date=27 March 2006|access-date=6 April 2006|archive-date=3 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203065423/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4848408.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> and the official, albeit mostly administrative, capital of the country was relocated from Yangon to Naypyidaw.

=== Rationale behind moving the capital ===
There are several assumptions why the capital was moved: Naypyidaw is more centrally located than the old capital, [[Yangon]]. It is also a [[Transport hub|transportation hub]] located adjacent to the [[Shan State|Shan]], [[Kayah State|Kayah]], and [[Kayin State|Kayin]] states. It was felt by governmental and military leaders that a stronger military and governmental presence nearby might provide stability to those chronically turbulent regions.<ref name=McGeown2005>McGeown, Kate (8 November 2005).

===Administrative divisions===
Naypyidaw Union Territory consists of 2 [[Districts of Myanmar|districts]] subdivided into 8 [[Townships of Myanmar|townships]]. [[Pyinmana Township|Pyinmana]], [[Lewe Township|Lewe]], and [[Tatkone Township|Tatkone]] townships were all formerly part of [[Yamethin District]] in [[Mandalay Region]]. Ottarathiri, Dekkhinathiri, Popphathiri, Zabuthiri, and Zeyathiri are all new townships under construction. Like the townships in the rest of the country, they are governed by a development affairs organization (DAO) which includes a Township Administrator appointed by the [[General Administration Department]], and an elected Township Development Affairs Committee (TDAC).<ref name="Asia"/>

There is sometimes some controversy about land use and changes in land ownership related to the urban spread of Naypyidaw.

==Costs and issues==
One estimate puts the cost in the range of $3–4 billion [[USD]] although only part of this estimate is for cash spending because non-cash investments were also reportedly involved in supporting the construction effort.<ref name=":0"/>

There is now continual travel by vehicles along the {{Convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} highway from Yangon to Naypyidaw, which is four lanes for most of the way. There are relatively few vehicles for much of the time on the road. Most trucks traveling north from Yangon to Naypyidaw and Mandalay are prohibited from using the highway. The [[Asian Development Bank]] has estimated that allowing more trucks onto the road would save over $100 million per year in reduced traveling time and other savings.<ref>Thomas Manch and Kyaw Lin Htoon, '[http://frontiermyanmar.net/en/the-road-rule-costing-myanmar-billions The road rules costing Myanmar billions'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410170740/https://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/the-road-rule-costing-myanmar-billions/ |date=10 April 2022 }}, ''Frontier Myanmar'', 14 December 2017.</ref> There are plans to turn the road into a six-lane highway for greater safety.<ref>Construction on some sections of a six-lane highway are already underway (mid-2014) along the highway. Parts of the highway have already been widened to six lanes, and a number of bridges along the road are in the construction stage of being widened. For a discussion of safety concerns about the national highways to Naypyidaw, see the report about plans to improve the highway linking Naypyidaw and [[Mandalay]] at Kyaw Hsu Mon, '[http://www.irrawaddy.org/business/govt-calls-foreign-investment-death-highway-upgrade.html Govt Calls for Foreign Investment in 'Death Highway' Upgrade'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094104/http://www.irrawaddy.org/business/govt-calls-foreign-investment-death-highway-upgrade.html |date=16 October 2015 }}, ''The Irrawaddy'', 29 December 2014.</ref>

The proportion of housing that meets expatriate needs is limited because the majority of existing apartments are for government employees.<ref>Kyaw Soe Htet, '[http://www.mmtimes.com/news/more-time-needed-expatriates-consider-relocating-nay-pyi-taw.html More time needed before expatriates consider relocating to Nay Pti Daw'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410170722/https://www.mmtimes.com/news/more-time-needed-expatriates-consider-relocating-nay-pyi-taw.html |date=10 April 2022 }}, ''Myanmar Times'', 8 October 2019.</ref>
