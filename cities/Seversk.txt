Seversk is the site of the [[Siberian Chemical Combine]], founded in 1954. It comprises several [[nuclear reactor]]s and chemical plants for separation, enrichment, and reprocessing of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. Following an agreement in March 2003 between [[Russia]] and the [[United States]] to shut down Russia's three remaining plutonium-producing reactors, two of the three plutonium producing reactors (the two that are situated in Seversk, at the [[Sibirskaya Nuclear Power Plant]]) were shut down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://world-nuclear-news.org/print.aspx?id=18136|title=Russia shuts second plutonium-producing reactor at Seversk|date=6 June 2008|publisher=World Nuclear News|access-date=August 26, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726095422/http://world-nuclear-news.org/print.aspx?id=18136|archive-date=July 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>The remaining operating production reactor is sited at [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk in Krasnoyarsk Krai]].</ref>

[[Nuclear weapon|Nuclear warheads]] are produced and stored on the premises. One of the most serious [[nuclear accident]]s at SGCE{{explain|reason=What is SGCE?|date=April 2024}} occurred on April&nbsp;6, 1993, when a tank containing a highly [[radioactivity|radioactive]] solution exploded (see [[Seversk#Tomsk-7 explosion|§ Tomsk-7 explosion]]).

==Government==
The current Chair of the City [[Duma]] and Mayor is [[Grigory Shamin]], who has served since 2010. The current city manager is Anatoly Abramov, who has served since August 2007.

== Secret city ==
[[File:Seversk checkpoint.jpg|thumb|left|Central entry checkpoint]]

Seversk had been a secret city in the [[Soviet Union]] until President [[Boris Yeltsin]] decreed in 1992 that such cities could use their historical names. The town had not been marked on the official maps until then. As was the tradition with Soviet towns containing secret facilities, the designation "Tomsk-7" (like its predecessor "Pyaty Pochtovy") is simply a [[postal code]] which implies that the place is located close to the city of Tomsk.

For many years, residents have been restricted from entering or leaving the city. Upon leaving Seversk, residents had to surrender their special entry passes at the checkpoint and it was forbidden to discuss where they worked or lived. In 1987, some restrictions were lifted due to the large number of residents who worked or studied in Tomsk.

The city still remains closed to non-residents. There are six checkpoints where visitors must show entry documents. Permission to visit the city may only be granted by the appropriate authorities by a request of the institution being visited, or by a request of a private party such as a close relative. Visitors can apply for entry passes at the main checkpoint; prior to May 2007, they needed to visit a special office in Tomsk.

==Tomsk-7 explosion==
There was a [[nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] at the [[Tomsk-7 Reprocessing Complex]] on April&nbsp;6, 1993, when a tank exploded due to formation of [[red oil]], while [[nitric acid]] was being added to a [[PUREX|plutonium-uranium mixture]]. The explosion had a force of approximately 100 [[TNT equivalent|kg of TNT]] and blew out a large section of the exterior wall of the high level radioactive processing room,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://xcdsystem.com/wmsym/archives//1997/sess36/36-09.htm|title = 36-09}}</ref> releasing a cloud of radioactive gas. The cloud was dispersed northwards by the wind, with some of the radioactive material settling over the neighboring village of [[Georgiyevka, Tomsk Oblast|Georgiyevka]].

[[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] has identified the Tomsk-7 explosion as one of the world's 10 [[List of nuclear and radiation fatalities by country|"worst nuclear disasters"]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|access-date=August 26, 2009|date=March 25, 2009}}</ref> The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] considers the event a [[International Nuclear Event Scale|Level 3 "serious incident"]].<ref>THE RADIOLOGICAL ACCIDENT IN THE REPROCESSING PLANT AT TOMSK, [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], https://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/p060_scr.pdf</ref>
