'''Xico''' is a city in the [[State of Mexico]], [[Mexico]]. It serves as the municipal seat of [[Valle de Chalco]] [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]], with which it is, for all practical purposes, coterminous. The municipality lies adjacent to the east side of the [[Mexico City|Federal District (Distrito Federal)]] and is part of the Mexico City [[metropolitan areas of Mexico|metropolitan area]]. The city and municipality lie on the old lakebed of [[Lake Chalco]], which was drained like much of the Basin of Mexico. The city name comes from the nearby Xico hill (Cerro de Xico) and the name of the municipality comes from the old lake plus a reference to the "Programa Nacional de Solidaridad" (National Program of Solidarity) which was initiated here. The municipality's [[glyph]] and shield make reference to both names. It is a distinct entity from the city and municipality of [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Chalco]], which is nearby. "Chalco" in both names refers to the [[Chalca]] tribe that were one of the original inhabitants of the area.<ref name="EncMuc">{{cite web |url= http://www.e-mexico.gob.mx/work/EMM10/EMM_mexico/mpios/15122a.htm |title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Valle de Chalco Solidaridad |access-date=2008-04-11}}</ref>

==The city==

Early pre-Hispanic history refers to the area around the Cerro de Xico as the Island of Xico as most of the modern city was underwater until relatively recently. The area was mostly fishing villages from 900 BC to 100 AD. However, from 550 to 650, the area was dominated by the [[Teotihuacan]] culture. From 650 to 750, an [[Otomi people|Otomi]] settlement gained prominence. The [[Acxoteca]]s arrived around 1328, the same time that [[chinampa]] farming began here. Xico was conquered by the [[Aztec]] [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]] in 1381, after which groups of [[Mexica]]s settle here extending the chinampa farming system in the 14th and 15th centuries. The area was ceded to [[Hernán Cortés]] by the Spanish king in 1529. The modern area began in the 19th century when Porfirio Díaz ordered the draining of Lake Chalco which devastated the economies of the former coastline communities. The [[Mexican Revolution]] tried to compensate these communities by the creation of [[ejido]]s, the two largest here being Estación Xico with 507 hectares and San Miguel Xico with 250 hectares. These ejidos, as well as the present-day city and municipality, rest almost entirely on former lakebed.<ref name="EncMuc"/>

For the most part, the area laid barren until the late 1970s, when there was a sudden influx of families coming from the central and southern parts of Mexico in search of land. Despite its proximity, there was no infrastructure for basic services including schooling for children. Many people bought ejido land causing legal problems. The federal government had to step in to install basic services and regularize the property rights of more than 77,000 parcels of ejido land that was sold. However, the area did not become a separate municipality until 1994. In the census of 2005 the population of Xico was 331,321 people.<ref name="INEGI">{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=Link to tables of population data from Census of 2005 INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática |access-date=2008-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406130712/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archive-date=April 6, 2013 }}</ref>

The only notable sites in the area are The '''Cerro del Marqués''' which contains architecture and archeological remains but these are not open to the public. However, there is the '''Museo Comunitario''' (Community Museum) which displays local archeological finds located in the '''Casa de Cultura “Chalchiuhtlicue”'''. There is also the '''Ex – Hacienda de Xico''' which was constructed at the same time the lake was drained.<ref name="EncMuc"/>
