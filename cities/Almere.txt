==History==
{{unreferencedsect|date=July 2023}}
The original plans for the [[Zuiderzee Works|IJsselmeerpolders]] saw the land being used for agriculture. However, after [[World War II]] housing was needed for the rapidly growing population of [[Amsterdam]] and two towns were planned in the polders Oostelijk Flevoland and Zuidelijk Flevoland. The town in Oostelijk Flevoland became [[Lelystad]]. The town in Zuidelijk Flevoland was still called Zuidweststad (English: South West City) on the first sketches, but in the 1970s it became called ''Almere'', named after the lake [[Almere (lake)|Almere]], the early medieval name of the [[Zuiderzee]]. The first house in Almere was finished in 1976. At that time the town was still controlled by the ''Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders'' (Z.IJ.P.), with a [[Landdrost]]. In 1984 Almere became an official municipality. Originally, Almere was envisioned as a town with multiple centres. This idea was later abandoned in favor of allowing neighbourhoods like Tussen de Vaarten to be built. There is also a difference between the way houses are built in the oldest and the newest parts of the city. The housing plan in Almere in the 1970s was basic functionality and a levelling of social status. However, starting in the 1990s more exclusive homes with striking designs were built (notably in the Regenboogbuurt).

Prior to 1984 Almere had an ''Adviesraad'', which was chosen every 2 years (1978–1980, 1980–1982, 1982–1984). This ''Adviesraad'' was made up of different political parties similar to a local council. On 11 March 1977 the first ''adviescommissie'' was elected. It consisted of 5 people that were chosen on personal title.
Since 2018, the council of Almere has comprised a total of 45 members.

==Culture==

On 19 May 2004, at the instigation of [[Kees Kousemaker]], owner of the Amsterdam comics store [[Lambiek]], the first buildings of the ''Stripheldenbuurt'' were inaugurated in Almere. This is a district where all street names are named after famous comics characters and cartoonists.<ref name= "lambiek.net8" >{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/lambiek_kerkstraat119.htm|title=The History of Lambiek (2003-2005)}}</ref>

==Sport==

Almere is the home of [[association football|football]] team [[Almere City FC]], American football team FlevoPhantoms and the home of professional basketball team the [[Almere Sailors]].

==Transport==
[[File:Scouwburg Almere.jpg|right|thumb|Kunstlinie Almere Flevoland (formerly known as "Schouwburg Almere")]]
The traffic infrastructure in Almere is recognisable because of its
separate infrastructure for cycles (which, in most cases, have separate cycle paths), cars
and buses (the buses drive on a separate bus lane in most parts of the city).
Almere is connected to the motorways [[A6 motorway (Netherlands)|A6]] and [[A27 motorway (Netherlands)|A27]].

===Railway===
In 1987 Almere was connected to the national railway system (see
[[Nederlandse Spoorwegen|NS]]) with the fully completed
[[Flevolijn]] which connected [[Weesp railway station|Weesp]] to [[Lelystad Centrum railway station|Lelystad Centrum]].

Almere currently has six railway stations:
*[[Almere Poort railway station|Almere Poort]] (opened December 9, 2012)
*[[Almere Muziekwijk railway station|Almere Muziekwijk]] (opened May 30, 1987)
*[[Almere Centrum railway station|Almere Centrum]] (opened May 30, 1987)
*[[Almere Parkwijk railway station|Almere Parkwijk]] (opened on February 1, 1996)
*[[Almere Buiten railway station|Almere Buiten]] (opened May 30, 1987)
*[[Almere Oostvaarders railway station|Almere Oostvaarders]] (opened December 12, 2004)

A seasonal-use station, [[Almere Strand railway station|Almere Strand]], was set up for certain events, such as Libelle Zomerweek. The station was made up of iron platforms. It was opened in May 1996 under the name ''Muiderzand''. The station was closed after June 1996 but re-opened in June 1999 under the name ''Muiderstrand'' and closed again in July 1999. It re-opened again in 2001 under the name ''Almere Strand'' as an official seasonal-use station, meaning it was now open certain seasons every year. Because of the rapid development of the adjacent borough Almere Poort, it was decided to open an official station there (see [[Almere Poort railway station|Almere Poort]]), thus making the station of Almere Strand obsolete. Almere Poort station opened on December 9, 2012. Therefore, Almere Strand station was officially closed just after the summer of 2012 and its iron platforms were torn down in the weekend of October 6–7, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stationsweb.nl/station.asp?station=almerestrand&vraag=almere%20strand |title=Archived copy |website=www.stationsweb.nl |access-date=22 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220406232711/http://www.stationsweb.nl/station.asp?station=almerestrand&vraag=almere%20strand |archive-date=6 April 2022 |url-status=dead}}</ref> There are no remains of the station, although passengers can still see where the platforms once stood from the windows of Flevolijn trains.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

''Line 159 is operated by the bus company [[Connexxion]].''

Since April 2012, there was a rush hour route, 150, to [[Utrecht]] which connected Almere directly with the University Area of Utrecht called [[De Uithof]]. (This was previously done by former bus line 295<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.ovinnederland.nl/wiki/Lijn_295_Almere-Stad_Station_Centrum_-_Utrecht_AZU|title=Lijn 295 Almere-Stad Station Centrum - Utrecht AZU - OV in Nederland Wiki|website=wiki.ovinnederland.nl}}</ref>). Due to budget cuts, line 150 was scrapped on July 9, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvutrecht.nl/nieuws/1484019/|title=Snelwegbus Utrecht-Almere stopt ermee - RTV Utrecht|website=www.rtvutrecht.nl|date=7 June 2016 }}</ref>
