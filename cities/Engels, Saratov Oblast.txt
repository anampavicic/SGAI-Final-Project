'''Engels''' ({{lang-rus|Э́нгельс|p=ˈɛnɡʲɪlʲs}}) is a [[Classification of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Saratov Oblast]], [[Russia]]. An important [[port]] located on the [[Volga River]] across from [[Saratov]], the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]], it is connected to it with a [[Saratov Bridge|bridge]]. It is the second-largest city in Saratov Oblast, with a population of {{ru-census2010|202,419|.}}

Historically a major center for [[Volga Germans]], the city was known jointly as '''Pokrovsk''' (''Pokrovskaya [[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]]'' (until 1914), ''Pokrovsk'' (until 1931)) in [[Russian language|Russian]] and as '''Kosakenstadt''' in [[German language|German]], until it was renamed after German [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoretician [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1931. Engels served as the capital of the [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Volga German ASSR]] from 1918 until its abolition in 1941.

==History==
What would become the city was founded as a [[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]] named Pokrovskaya Sloboda by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Chumak]] settlers in 1747. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]], ethnic [[Germans]] were encouraged to settle in the [[Volga region]] and many moved into the town, making it a major center of the [[Volga Germans|Volga German]] culture. It was granted official town status and renamed '''Pokrovsk''' ({{lang|ru|Покровск}}) in 1914.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://enc.rusdeutsch.ru/articles/1375 | title=ПОКРОВСКАЯ СЛОБОДА (Покровск), ныне город Энгельс Саратовской области }}</ref> At that time, the town was commonly known as '''Kosakenstadt''' ("[[Cossacks]]' Town") in [[German language|German]], alongside its official Russian name. During the [[Russian Civil War]], the region came under control of the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], and in 1918 it became the capital of the newly established [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Volga German ASSR]] within the Russian SFSR. Pokrovsk/Kosakenstadt was renamed Engels in 1931{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}, after German communist philosopher [[Friedrich Engels]]. The Volga German ASSR was abolished in 1941 with the [[German invasion of Russia]] serving as a pretext, and the city became part of [[Saratov Oblast]]. Its German inhabitants suffered persecution as Soviet authorities accused them of being [[Spying|spies]] for [[Nazi Germany]]. All Germans were [[Deportation of the Volga Germans|deported from Engels]], with most being sent far away to [[Siberia]] and the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]. On August&nbsp;26, 2011, a monument in honor of the [[Volga Germans#20th century|Russian-German victims]] of repression within the [[Soviet Union]] was unveiled in the city.
