With a population of 1,536,097, it is the second-largest city in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West Region]] and the 10th-largest in the country. Its [[Greater Goiânia|metropolitan area]] has a population of 2,890,418, making it the 12th-largest in Brazil. With an area of approximately {{convert|739|km²|0|abbr=off}}, it has a continuous geography with few hills and lowlands, with flat lands in most of its territory, especially the [[Meia Ponte River]], in addition to Botafogo and Capim Puba streams.

Goiânia has its origins as a [[planned community|planned city]], founded on October 24, 1933, by then Governor [[Pedro Ludovico]] to serve as the new state capital and administrative center. Before this, the state capital was the town of [[Goiás, Goiás|Goiás]].

It is the second most populous city in the Central-West Region, only surpassed by the country's capital [[Brasília]], located about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from Goiânia. The city is an important economic hub of the region and is considered a strategic center for such areas as industry, medicine, fashion and agriculture. Goiânia has previously been described as having the largest green area per inhabitant in Brazil and the second-most in the world, after [[Edmonton]], Alberta, Canada.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} PEREIRA, Alberto.

==History==
The idea of creating a new [[States of Brazil|state]] capital had been bounced around from early on in the state of Goiás. The first plan came from D. Marcos de Noronha who in 1753 wanted to establish the state capital in the municipality of Pirenópolis; again in 1863 [[José Vieira Couto de Magalhães]] put forward a plan to move the capital to the edge of the Araguaia river.

The impetus behind the efforts to move the state capital was the need to locate it in accordance with the economic interests of the state. The first state [[Capital (political)|capital]], Vila Boa (today [[Goiás, Goiás|City of Goiás]]), had been chosen when the economy was based on [[gold]] extraction. Later, when cattle-raising and [[agriculture]] came to dominate the state's development, the old capital was considered remote.

Legislators kept the idea of change alive for a long time. In 1891, the constitutional delegates officially included the idea of transferring the capital in the constitution, which was ratified in 1898 and again in 1918.

Vaguely remembered until 1930, the idea became a reality during the government of [[Pedro Ludovico]], who was the new governor appointed for the state of Goiás<ref>[http://www.blogconcurseiro.com.br/post/174022271795/concurso-delegado-pc-go-2018-veja-o-edital-com?is_related_post=1 Goiás] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519204841/https://www.blogconcurseiro.com.br/post/174022271795/concurso-delegado-pc-go-2018-veja-o-edital-com?is_related_post=1 |date=2018-05-19 }}</ref> after the military revolt of 1930. In 1932, a commission was created to choose where the new capital would be built. The choice was the municipality of Campinas. The mayor at the time, [[Andrelino Rodrigues de Moraes]], accepted the plan and donated about 242 acres of his land to build the new state capital.<ref>{{Cite news |title=G1 Globo |url=https://g1.globo.com/go/goias/noticia/2020/01/20/apos-86-anos-familia-que-doou-terras-para-construcao-de-goiania-ganha-direito-a-receber-restante-do-pagamento-por-terreno.ghtml |work=2020}}</ref> In 1933 the commission decided on the present location and the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] [[Rock (geology)|stone]] was laid.
[[File:Avenida_Anhanguera,_Goiânia.tif|thumb|left|Anhanguera Avenue in Goiânia in 1960.]]
The plan was for a city of 50,000 with the shape of a concentric radius — streets in the form of a spoke, with the Praça Cívica as the center, with the seats of the state and municipal government — the [[Palace]] of [[Emeralds]] and the Palace of Campinas.

In 1937, a decree was signed transferring the state capital from the Cidade de [[Goiás]] to Goiânia. The official inauguration occurred in 1942 with the presence of the president of the republic, governors, and ministers.

The name, Goiânia, came about in 1933 after a contest was held by a local [[newspaper]]. Readers from all over the state contributed, with some of the most popular names being Petrônia, Americana, Petrolândia, Goianópolis, Goiânia, Bartolomeu Bueno, Campanha, Eldorado, [[Anhanguera, Goiás|Anhanguera]], Liberdade, [[Goianésia]], and Pátria Nova, among others. In 1935 Pedro Ludovico used the name Goiânia for the first time, signing a decree creating the municipality.

===Art deco===

The first buildings in this planned city, designed by Attilio Correia Lima, were inspired by [[art deco]]. The collection of buildings is still representative, with 22 of them listed as National Heritage. Mostly built in the 1940s and 1950s, they have been recognized by the [[National Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage]]. The 22 [[building]]s and [[monument]]s are in the original center of Goiânia, as in the pioneering nucleus of [[:pt:Campinas (Goiás)|Campinas]], a town existing before Goiânia. Due to lack of maintenance, several of these buildings are in a state of disrepair.

===Radiation incident===
{{Main|Goiânia accident}}
On September 13, 1987, a [[radiation therapy|medical]] [[Ionizing radiation#Human-made radiation sources|radiation source]] containing radioactive [[caesium-137]] was stolen from an abandoned hospital in the city, causing four deaths and many non-fatal cases of [[radiation poisoning]].<ref name="Time">[http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705_1862268,00.html#ixzz0yd3Jb8Oe "The Worst Nuclear Disasters"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920061859/http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705_1862268,00.html#ixzz0yd3Jb8Oe |date=2010-09-20 }}. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> The incident was catalyzed by the Caesium salt giving off [[Cherenkov radiation]] once exposed to open air.  The soft bluish glow attracted many curious citizens who would take grains of the salt for themselves and family members in the form of jewelry.  Those who had not taken any of the salt but were in close contact with it also helped the spread of radiation sickness that set in within hours to days of exposure. Several city blocks had to be demolished due to the contamination.<ref name="Time"/> The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] report noted that city and state officials acted with remarkable speed to prevent further injury to the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub815_web.pdf |title=(page 1) |access-date=2011-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312190235/http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub815_web.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The former owner of the health clinic where the container was taken from was barred from retrieving some equipment from the building by court appointed guards.  The owner then ominously warned that the guards would be responsible for what happened with "the Caesium bomb", referring to the radiotherapy machine that would be responsible for the incident.

===Vegetation===
[[File:Goianiadozoo.jpg|thumb|Green area in Goiânia.]]
The "[[cerrado]]" landscape is characterized by extensive [[savanna]] formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys and includes various types of [[vegetation]]. [[Humid]] fields and "buriti" [[Moriche Palm|palm]] paths are found where the [[water]] table is near the surface. Alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more fertile [[soil]]s.

More than 1600 species of mammals, birds and reptiles have been identified in the cerrado,<ref>"Cerrado's Fauna", Costa et al., 1981)</ref> including 180 reptile species, 113 [[amphibian]]s, 837 [[bird]]s and 195 [[mammal]]s (WWF). Among the [[invertebrates]], the most notable are the termites and the leaf-cutter ants ("saúvas"). They are the main [[herbivores]] of the cerrado, important to consuming and decomposing of [[organic matter]], as well as constituting an important [[food]] source to many other [[animal]] species.

==Economy==
[[File:Goiânia2006.jpg|thumb|Downtown Goiânia at night.]]

While Goiânia's economy today is based on a variety of industries, the local economy's roots are found in the [[agricultural industry]] thriving in and around the city. The supply of agricultural equipment, tools, fertilizer and other products make up a large portion of the economic activity.
[[File:Estacionamento_do_Flamboyant_Shopping_Center_(1),_Goiânia,_setembro_de_2016.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance of Flamboyant Mall in Goiânia.]]
Second to agriculture are vehicle sales and service industry. Repairs, sales and reconditioning of vehicles are widespread and visible in all areas of the city.

The third largest contributor to the economy is the government sector. As Goiânia is the state capital of Goiás, it is home to many federal and state government agencies that provide a large number of jobs.

In recent years, modern telecommunications, with its supporting industry, has begun to expand into Goiânia. Many large Brazilian companies have established offices in the city.

In addition, due to Goiânia being the state capital, it is home to countless private medical centers/clinics of all kinds.

In 2005, the [[GDP]] of the city was R$13,354,065.00.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf|title=GDP|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Goiânia, Brazil|isbn=85-240-3919-1|year=2005|language=pt|access-date=2009-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002024524/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf|archive-date=2008-10-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the same year, the [[per capita income]] for the city was R$11,119.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf|title=per capita income|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Goiânia, Brazil|isbn=85-240-3919-1|year=2005|language=pt|access-date=2009-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002024524/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf|archive-date=2008-10-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:Corpus_Christi_em_Goiânia,_2005.jpg|thumb|[[Feast of Corpus Christi]] in Goiânia.]]
[[File:Igreja - panoramio (5).jpg|thumb|Presbyterian Church of Goiânia.]]
The population of the municipality in 2011, according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], was 1,302,001 inhabitants, being the [[List of municipalities in Goiás|most populous municipality in the state]] and [[List of Brazilian states by population density|12th in Brazil]]. The main reason for the large population in the vicinity of Goiânia and Brasília — that spurred the growth of the city and the region between it and the federal capital —  making the axis Brasília-Goiânia's third largest agglomeration in the country, bringing together about nine million people. The [[Greater Goiânia|metropolitan area of Goiânia]] is the tenth largest agglomeration urban Brazil, with a population of 2,173,141, presents a population density of 782.5 inhabitants per {{convert|1|km2|1|abbr=out}}, the largest of its state.
[[File:Assembleia de Deus Campinas (3), Goiânia, outubro de 2016.jpg|thumb|Temple of [[Assemblies of God]] in Goiânia.]]
The [[Human Development Index]] Municipal (HDI) of Goiânia is considered high by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), at 0.832, the second largest of any state of Goiás (in 242 municipalities); third of all Midwest Region of Brazil (in 446) and 111 from all over Brazil (in 5507). Considering only the education, the index value is 0.933 (classified as very high), while Brazil's is 0.849. The longevity index is 0.751 (0.638 is Brazilian) and income is 0.813 (that of Brazil is 0.723). The city has most of the indicators high and similar to the national average according to UNDP. The literacy rate is 96.78% of adults. The incidence of poverty, measured by the IBGE, is 3.64%; the lower the incidence of poverty is 2.92%; the top is 4.35%; and subjective poverty incidence is 4.35%.

===Social inequality===

Among Brazil's [[metropolises]], Goiânia has the lowest number of "[[favela]]s" (Portuguese for slums) according to data extracted from the 2010 census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]].<ref name= IBGE >{{cite web|url=http://www.appego.com.br/?pag=conteudo&id=5751|title=A metrópole com menos favelas|language=pt|author=Mergulhão, Alfredo|date=2011-12-22|publisher=APPEGO|access-date=2013-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720051503/http://www.appego.com.br/?pag=conteudo&id=5751|archive-date=2013-07-20|url-status=live}}</ref> The IBGE named seven areas in Goiânia as being "subnormal agglomerations", a government term for irregular housing.<ref name= G1 >{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/goias/noticia/2011/12/estudo-do-ibge-aponta-12-favelas-em-goias-7-delas-na-capital-do-estado.html|title=Estudo do IBGE aponta 12 favelas em Goiás, 7 delas na capital do estado|date=2011-12-21|language=pt|publisher=G1 Goiás|access-date=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702000458/http://g1.globo.com/goias/noticia/2011/12/estudo-do-ibge-aponta-12-favelas-em-goias-7-delas-na-capital-do-estado.html|archive-date=2013-07-02|url-status=live}}</ref> In these locales, however, most of the households do have electricity, water, and trash collection.<ref name= G1/>

While perhaps not fitting the criteria of [[favela]]s, Goiânia has several sectors, particularly on the outskirts, that are low income.<ref name=Ferreira>{{cite web|title=Cidades – Capital tem 141 áreas semelhantes a favelas |url=http://www.mp.go.gov.br/portalweb/1/noticia/364febdf4dc5ed82228e16468e2a4415.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805103409/http://www.mp.go.gov.br/portalweb/1/noticia/364febdf4dc5ed82228e16468e2a4415.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-05 |publisher=Ministério Público do Estado de Goiás |date=2009-04-11 |author=Ferreira, Érica |language=pt }}</ref>

===Ethnicity and immigration===
Goiânia is a [[multiracial]] city as the result of intense migration. The populace has intimate connection with the settlement of the interior of the Brazilian center-west, gradually attracted mainly by migrants from the interior of Goiás and other regions in other states of Brazil. According to a survey in 2010, most migrants are from [[Minas Gerais]], [[Bahia]], [[Tocantins]], [[Maranhão]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Pará]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goianiabr.com.br/2010/10/goiania-77-anos-destino-de-migrantes.html |title=Goiânia 77 anos – Destino de migrantes |access-date=9 May 2012 |author=Jornal O Hoje |publisher=Goiânia – No Coração do Brasil |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703211335/http://www.goianiabr.com.br/2010/10/goiania-77-anos-destino-de-migrantes.html |archive-date=3 July 2013 }}</ref> According to the census of the IBGE 2022, in search of self-declaration, the population of Goiânia is composed of [[White Brazilian|Multiracial]] (48.0%), [[Pardo Brazilian|White]] (43.6%), [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] (7.9%), [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] (0.3%) and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] (0.1%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Censo 2022 - Panorama |url=https://censo2022.ibge.gov.br/panorama/}}</ref>

Initially, Goiânia was populated by migrants from the interior of Goiás. Its creation was crucial to the population growth in the state, since [[Vila Boa, Goiás|Vila Boa]], the ancient capital showed signs of declining population, is considered a setback for the state. The founding of Goiânia is now considered a successful settlement of the Brazilian interior. Today, the population coming from Goiânia is predominantly [[Minas Gerais]], [[Bahia]], [[Tocantins]], [[Maranhão]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Pará]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goianiabr.com.br/2010/10/goiania-77-anos-destino-de-migrantes.html |title=Goiânia 77 anos – Destino de migrantes |access-date=2012-05-09 |author=Jornal O Hoje |publisher=Goiânia – No Coração do Brasil |language=pt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703211335/http://www.goianiabr.com.br/2010/10/goiania-77-anos-destino-de-migrantes.html |archive-date=2013-07-03 }}</ref>

===Religion===
Like the cultural variety verifiable in Goiânia, there are religious manifestations present in the city. According to the [[IBGE]] (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), the population of Goiânia is composed mostly of [[Catholics]] (50.8%), [[evangelicals]] (32.4%), and [[spiritists]] (4.2%). Approximately 10% of the population has no religion. It is also home to a number of practitioners of other religions (2.3%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=520870&idtema=91&search=goias%7Cgoiania%7Ccenso-demografico-2010:-resultados-da-amostra-religiao-|title=Religions in Goiânia|access-date=27 June 2017|publisher=[[IBGE]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090822/http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=520870&idtema=91&search=goias%7Cgoiania%7Ccenso-demografico-2010:-resultados-da-amostra-religiao-|archive-date=2016-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Education==
Notable institutes include:

* [[Universidade Federal de Goiás]] (UFG)
* [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Goiás]] (PUC-GO)
* [[Universidade Estadual de Goiás]] (UEG)
* Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia de Goiás (IFG)
*Faculdade Unida de Campinas (FacUnicamps)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facunicamps.edu.br/institucional|title=institucional|website=www.facunicamps.edu.br|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Road====
[[File:Av._85_Goiânia.jpg|thumb|250px|85 Avenue.]]
Goiânia is connected to the federal capital, [[Brasília]], via a four-lane tolled highway ([[BR-060]]) and to [[São Paulo]] via another four-lane tolled highway ([[BR-153]]). The state of Goiás maintains the main artery roads (marked GO-xxx) in and out of the capital: four-lane roads GO-403, GO–020, GO–080, GO–070, and GO–060.

As Goiânia was a planned city, the downtown cores (Setores Central/Oeste/Sul) are relatively easy to navigate. Along the years, the planned urban development was replaced by the typical Brazilian way of urban growth, i.e., pure laissez-faire. Social and urban demands were neglected.

Due to this lack of planning and reliable public transportation, Goiânia is the metropolis with the highest number of cars per capita in the country; there are 1,000,000 registered motor vehicles in the city. The many vehicles on the roads cause major congestion during peak times.

====Rail====
The [[Railway]] line was closed in the 1970s, though the art deco station remains open to the public. Nowadays transportation of goods is carried out via the connecting [[highways]].

====Public transportation====
All public transportation is via bus. Bus service in Goiânia is provided by several transportation companies working under the municipality.

There is a bus system map the can be founded in RMTC site. Buses run on a predictable time schedule. Goiânia is the only city of South America that has the ITS technology of bus transport, but the buses are usually full. Unlike most Brazilian cities, there are no ticket collectors on the buses in Goiânia; all the fares are collected using magnetic paper cards and turnstiles. Passes are provided by [[SitPASS]] and can be purchased from street vendors or in small shops throughout the city.

Anhanguera Avenue is one of the largest/longest avenues in the city. It underwent major work in the late 1990s that created a dedicated bus lane for its entire length, with stations every 0.5 kilometer. The bus lanes are in the center of the avenue, giving it a distinct look. The fare to travel on the Anhanguera bus route is half of normal fare, and all buses on this route are [[articulated buses]].

=====The new contract=====
Under the new contract, firmed in 2009, many aspects of the public transportation are being changed:
[[File:Aeroporto de Goiânia - 01.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes|Gol Airlines]] at Santa Genoveva Airport.]]
*The terminal stations are now placed under administration of the companies that are refurbishing them;
*The buses are being equipped with GPS modules to solve the schedule problem and many other benefits, adapted to give accessibility to [[disability|disabled people]], radios to give fast response on reroutes and other events, and other minor changes;
*The introduction of the CityBus, a service of microbuses focused on giving a choice to people of higher wealth to use the public transit system instead of their cars and to tourists who are visiting the city.
*Changes on "Eixo Anhanguera" (Anhanguera axis) and its terminals. It is unclear what changes that will be made, but one of the main issues under discussion is the much criticized change in fares; in future, a person that gets on a terminal from the axis to integrate with an inter-municipal metropolitan line will have to pay a complete fare.
*A North-South axis is part of the project, but as of August/09 it has not been implemented yet
*An Operational Control Center that will monitor the bus traffic through GPS.
*A free number for users to call to know how much time is left before the next bus arrives is another part of project that has not yet been implemented.

===Airports===
[[Santa Genoveva Airport]] is on the northeast side Goiânia. Six airlines fly out of this airport to destinations in Brazil. The new Santa Genoveva International Airport started operating in May, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opopular.com.br/editorias/vida-urbana/conhe%C3%A7a-o-novo-aeroporto-de-goi%C3%A2nia-por-dentro-1.817433 |title=Conheça o novo aeroporto de Goiânia por dentro |date=April 2015 |access-date=2019-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094406/http://www.opopular.com.br/editorias/vida-urbana/conhe%C3%A7a-o-novo-aeroporto-de-goi%C3%A2nia-por-dentro-1.817433 |archive-date=2016-10-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> In total, the new airport has 34,100 m<sup>2</sup>, 4 gates, 23 check-in counters, 11 elevators, 4 escalators, 3 baggage carousels and 3 inspection lines with X-ray and metal detectors. According to Infraero, with this structure, the new airport can receive up to 6,5 million passengers a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/goias/noticia/2016/05/comecam-operacoes-no-novo-terminal-do-aeroporto-de-goiania.html |title=G1 - Começam as operações no novo terminal do aeroporto de Goiânia - notícias em Goiás |date=21 May 2016 |access-date=2017-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601183908/http://g1.globo.com/goias/noticia/2016/05/comecam-operacoes-no-novo-terminal-do-aeroporto-de-goiania.html |archive-date=2017-06-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Aeródromo Nacional de Aviação]] handles [[general aviation]] operations.

===Security===
Goiânia is considered a safe city compared to most state capitals within Brazil. The average murder rate per year is under 450 persons per year according to the Goiás State Police. It was, however, found in a study in 2011 performed by a Mexican think tank — the Citizens' Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice — that Goiânia ranks as the 40th most dangerous city in the world.<ref name="San Pedro Sula, la ciudad más violenta del mundo; Juárez, la segunda">{{cite web | url=http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/sala-de-prensa/541-san-pedro-sula-la-ciudad-mas-violenta-del-mundo-juarez-la-segunda | title=San Pedro Sula, la ciudad más violenta del mundo; Juárez, la segunda | access-date=November 22, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028124655/http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/sala-de-prensa/541-san-pedro-sula-la-ciudad-mas-violenta-del-mundo-juarez-la-segunda | archive-date=October 28, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The city is patrolled and under the watch of the Goias Military Police, which is responsible for responding to crime and maintaining check points in the city and state. The Military Police are normally dressed in light tan military uniforms while patrolling. The prosecution and investigations of crime and all administration issues are handled by the Civil police (''Policia Civil'').

Within Goiânia traffic rules are enforced by the "AMT", whose members are traffic wardens with some minor police powers. This unit falls under the ownership of the city. Their responsibilities are to ensure road rules are enforced and attend to all accidents on the city streets.

==Green areas==
[[File:Lago_das_Rosas,_em_Goiânia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Green area in the Lago das Rosas Park.]]
Goiânia is home to a large number of skyscrapers dominating the center and one-floor family homes spreading out across the verdant tree-covered plain. Many of the streets are lined with tropical fruit trees, and there are many parks with remnants of the original tropical vegetation. Thirty percent of the city area is planted in trees — {{convert|3.75|km2|2|abbr=out}} of the {{convert|11|km2|2|abbr=out}}.

The most important of these parks are the Parque Zoológico, Parque Vaca Brava, Parque Ecológico, Bosque dos Buritis and Parque Areião. One of the biggest parks is the Bosque dos Buritís with an area of 140,000 square m and containing many [[buriti]] palm trees, which have a yellow fruit. Parque Areião is home to monkeys native to the area. Almost all of the parks are surrounded by walking paths.

Goiânia is known for being the ‘spring capital’ and was planned as a modern city, growing outside from the center. In the starting years this building plan worked well, but through the quick growth the plan was not followed to the letter, with the exception of the green areas, causing severe infrastructure problems in some areas, in particular with the public transport and healthcare systems.

In the Bosque dos Buritis is the Monument for World Peace, designed by [[Siron Franco]]. This monument contains a 7-meter high ampoule with walls of glass and the soil of more than 50 countries from all over the world. Every year on World Environment Day there will be scattered soil of a new country added.

Another attraction is the Chico Mendes Botanic Garden, housing trees and flowers like bromelias, orchids, fruit trees and a lake.

The municipality contains part of the {{convert|2132|ha}} [[Altamiro de Moura Pacheco State Park]], created in 1992.<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|Parque Estadual Altamiro de Moura Pacheco – SECIMA}}|language=pt|title=Parque Estadual Altamiro de Moura Pacheco|publisher=SECIMA|url=http://www.secima.go.gov.br/post/ver/197722/parque-estadual-altamiro-de-moura-pacheco-peamp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302202022/http://www.secima.go.gov.br/post/ver/197722/parque-estadual-altamiro-de-moura-pacheco-peamp|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-03-02|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>

===Parque Zoológico===
[[File:Vista_do_Parque_Flamboyant_(1),_Jardim_Goiás,_Goiânia,_dezembro_de_2016.jpg|thumb|250px|right|View of Flamboyant Park.]]
Created in 1946, the zoo contains over 1,000 animals, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. Five streams have their source in the park, which, besides the zoo, contains the Horto Florestal and the Lago das Rosas (''Lake of Roses''). The park is in the Setor Oeste, one of the richest residential areas of Goiânia.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Buriti Park===
In the center of the city this is Goiânia's oldest green area. It has an area of {{convert|120,000|m2|sqft|lk=out|abbr=off}}. There is a running track and exercise area, that has pull-up bars and sit-up benches with various inclines. There are three artificial lakes created by Buriti Stream. It is home to the Goiânia Art Museum and the Free Center of Arts. It houses a group of marmosets and many turtles.

===Vaca Brava Park===
[[File:Vaca_Brava_Park_in_Goiânia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goiânia seen from Vaca Brava Park.]]
Vaca Brava Park, renamed Parque Sulivan Silvestre after Dr. Sulivan Silvestre de Oliveira. Every day at dawn hundreds of people begin their daily activities by walking or jogging along the sidewalk that encloses Parque Vaca Brava. It has an area of {{convert|18,000|m2|sqft|abbr=off}} and contains a lake, a forest with native species and places for exercise.
[[File:Parque_Areião_em_um_terça_feira.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Areião Park.]]
Vaca Brava (which could be roughly translated as Angry Cow) has become a symbol of the new thriving area of the Setor Bueno, which has flourished in recent decades and is now one of the most important zones of Goiânia.

===Areião Park===
The Areião is one of the largest green areas of Goiânia. In a wealthy area, it is known for its dense vegetation, where monkeys are spotted very often.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Besides the many trails, there is a lake, a jogging route and many wooden buildings, including a small theater, consisting of a stage and many seats in the middle of a bamboo forest.

===Cobra Veiga center for snake research===
Located in an area of {{convert|44000.5|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, it has an infrastructure for 750 serpents of different species, in addition to a laboratory and a rodent house. Its main activities are the extraction of poison for medicinal purposes, research on behavior of serpents in captivity and the recuperation of degraded areas and the preservation of springs and their forest.

==Leisure==
The leisure options are diverse. There are many shopping malls. There are numerous gyms, public and private. The city has a 45,000 capacity stadium: the [[Serra Dourada Stadium]]. Goiânia has a racetrack ([[Ayrton Senna]] International Racetrack), a [[Kart racing|kart track]] and a [[horse racing]] track.

===Sports===
Goiânia has five [[association football]] clubs: [[Goiás Esporte Clube]], [[Atlético Clube Goianiense]], [[Vila Nova Futebol Clube]], [[Goiânia Esporte Clube]], [[Monte Cristo Esporte Clube]]. Goiás compete in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]], while Atlético Goianiense compete in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Série B]], and Vila Nova in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Série B]].

Goiânia has two main sport stadiums that are used by the teams. Both stadiums are property of the State of Goias. The biggest one is the [[Serra Dourada Stadium]]. The stadium has the capacity of 50,049 spectators and it is used especially by [[Goiás Esporte Clube]] and [[Vila Nova Futebol Clube]]. Other important stadium in Goiânia is the [[Estádio Olímpico Pedro Ludovico|Pedro Ludovico Teixeira Stadium]], also known as Olímpico Stadium. The current capacity is 12,055 spectators and it is most used by [[Atlético Clube Goianiense]].
[[File:Estadio-olimpico-pedro-ludovico-teixeira-go-ii.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Estádio Olímpico Pedro Ludovico|Pedro Ludovico Stadium]].]]

===Museums===
The most important museums are the Museu Antropológico da Universidade Federal de Goiás, Instituto Goiano de Pré-História e Antropologia, Fundação Museu de Ornitologia, Museu de Arte Contemporânea and Museu Zoroastro Artiaga. One interesting place is the so-called Memorial do Cerrado.
[[File:Teatro_Rio_Vermelho_em_Goiânia,_2011.jpg|thumb|250px|Rio Vermelho Theatre.]]

=== Music ===
With several double success, Goiás itself is the cradle of the sertanejo (country music) genre. Two types of sertanejo predominate: {{lang|pt|modao|italic=no}} is identified as the old sertanejo music and [[sertanejo universitário]] as the new sertanejo music.

Goiânia, as the capital of a state that was rural until the 1980s, has been traditionally influenced by the [[Música sertaneja|sertanejo]] style, strongly connected with the countryside lifestyle. Though the sertanejo is still an icon of Goiás' culture, the rock scene is seen by some as a response to it and as the creator center of a Goianiense legitimately culture, independent of the countryside culture. Goiânia is a leading center in the underground rock movement in Brazil.

Goiânia is home to one of the most important rock scenes from Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} It started in the early 1990s, with the creation of the first independent rock festivals in the city. Independent labels like Monstro Discos, Two Beers or Not Two Beers and Insetus flourished and have been crucial to support and broadcast the scene, which, being completely independent from the mainstream media, sometimes is not known even to native Goianienses.

The main styles are alternative or [[indie rock]] represented by bands like MQN, Black Drawing Chalks, Violins, Torn Birds, Hang The Superstars, Valentina, NEM, Fantasma de Agnes and Flores Indecentes; [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] by bands like Desastre, Vacilo, {{Not a typo|Resistentes}}, Descarga Negativa, Senhores, Umbral and HC-137; and [[heavy metal music|metal]] with bands like Ressonância Mórfica (unlike most metal bands they sing in archaic Portuguese), Spiritual Carnage,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.myspace.com/bandaspiritualcarnage |title=Spiritual Carnage |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623003950/https://myspace.com/bandaspiritualcarnage |archive-date=2013-06-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> Eternal Devastation and Hellphoria.
