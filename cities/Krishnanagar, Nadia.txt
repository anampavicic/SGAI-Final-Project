[[Jagaddhatri]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is celebrated with grandeur in Krishnanagar, when lighting from the town of [[Chandannagar]] are brought. The origins of [[Jagaddhatri]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] in Krishnanagar can be traced back to the 18th century, when it was first celebrated by Maharaja [[Krishnachandra Roy|Krishna Chandra]], the king of Krishnanagar. Initiated by [[Krishnachandra Roy|Krishna Chandra]] in 1762, is the crowning glory of the annual festival. The Maharaja's absence from the [[Durga]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] that year left him heartbroken as he could not offer his prayers to Maa [[Durga]]. Returning by boat on Dasami, the day of idol immersion, the Maharaja saw the idols being immersed in the river and was overcome with grief. However, in a dream that night, he saw a teenage Goddess seated on a lion, resembling a white horse, assuring him that she would come to him on the Sukla Nabami tithi in the Bengali month of Kartick (October–November). Following her divine instructions, an idol of Goddess [[Jagaddhatri]] was sculpted and the puja was performed with great pomp and splendor. [[Jagaddhatri]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is celebrated across the Paras of Krishnanagar, with each Paras having its own unique customs and traditions. The Paras are essentially different neighborhoods or communities within the town, each with its own distinct identity and character. The most prominent of them all is Chasapara Barowari [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] where the deity is called Burima. This festival that has been celebrated for over 100 years, is known for its grandeur and splendor. The festival is organized by the Chasapara Barowari Committee, and it is celebrated with great enthusiasm and devotion by the locals. The festival is known for its magnificent pandal decorations, which are designed based on various themes and concepts. The pandals are adorned with colorful lights, flowers, and other decorative items, making them a visual treat for the visitors. During the [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]], the locals also perform a unique ritual called "chokkhudaan" where they offer their eyes to the Goddess in the form of a symbolic gesture. This ritual is believed to signify the devotee's willingness to see the truth and the divine light. The festival is also known for its colorful processions, which are accompanied by the beats of the dhak, a traditional Indian [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] instrument. One of the notable features of this Chasapara Barowari is the heavily adornment of Burima with gold jewellery. It is believed that Burima fulfills her true devotees wishes.

Krishnanagar is also famous for its '''Barodol Mela'''. Maharaja [[Krishnachandra Roy|Krishnachandra]], a devoted husband, once failed to fulfill his promise of taking his beloved queen to the neighboring fair at Ula Birnagar. To make up for it, he organized a grand festival in his own palace where 12 idols of [[Krishna]] were invited for a month-long stay. The tradition continues to this day, with the royal household playing a vital role in the festival's success, even though its splendor has faded somewhat over time.The festival is normally held after the [[Holi|Dolyatra]] in the Sukla Ekadashi tithi. It begins with the arrival of 12 idols of [[Krishna]], each representing a different form of the deity. The idols are displayed for public viewing for the first three days of the festival, after which they retire to a temple inside the palace as guests of the patron deity Boro [[Narayana|Narayan]]. Meanwhile, the month-long fair takes place in the vast field next to the old fort's gate, open to all who wish to participate. The fairgrounds are alive with the sounds of vendors hawking their wares, performers entertaining the crowds, and children laughing and screaming in delight as they ride the rides. The fair also provides a platform for local artisans to showcase their skills and sell their wares. From the clay toy makers to the [[Loom|handloom]] weavers, the fair is an opportunity for these artisans to display their products to a wider audience and earn a living.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://manaspratimbiswas.com/journals#barodol  | title= BARODOL MELA: A CULTURAL EXTRAVAGANZA OF KRISHNANAGAR|work= Celebration of Barodol Mela in Krishnanagar|publisher=  Manas Pratim Biswas |  access-date = 26 February 2023}}</ref>

=== Bethuadahari Forest ===
[[Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary|Bethuadahari Forest]], a forest covering about 67 hectares, is located at Bethuadahari which is situated about 22&nbsp;km from Krishnanagar.<ref name="nadia.nic.in" /> This forest is an extended deer park. The forest was established in 1980 to preserve the biodiversity of the central Gangetic alluvial zone. A census of 1998 reveals a population of 295 deer in this forest and other wildlife includes python, jungle cat, porcupine, monitor lizard, snake, and a variety of birds (around 50 species).

Bahadurpur Forest<ref name="nadia.nic.in" /> situated by the side of [[National Highway 34 (India)|NH 34]] in [[Krishnanagar II|Krishnanagar II Block]] has been chosen as a prospective spot for jungle safari. Hasadanga Beel,<ref name="nadia.nic.in" /> adjacent to Bahadurpur Forest, is a vast waterbody which can be transformed into a water sports complex. This [[beel]] has the potential to be developed as a safe haven for seasonal migratory birds.
