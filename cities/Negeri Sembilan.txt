'''Negeri Sembilan''' ({{IPA-may|ˈnəgəri səmbiˈlan}}, [[Negeri Sembilan Malay]]: ''Nogori Sombilan'', ''Nismilan''), historically spelled as '''Negri Sembilan''',<ref name=":0">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPdAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA120 |title=Area Handbook for Malaysia and Singapore |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |first=Bela C. |last=Maday |date=1965 |page=120 }}</ref> is a [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] in [[Malaysia]] which lies on the [[Peninsular Malaysia#Other features|western coast]] of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. It borders [[Selangor]] on the north, [[Pahang]] in the east, and [[Malacca]] and [[Johor]] to the south.

Negeri Sembilan has diverse [[tropical rainforest]]s and an [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial]] climate. The state's mountain ranges belong to the [[Titiwangsa Mountains]], a southern subrange of the [[Tenasserim Hills]] that span throughout southern Myanmar, southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, with [[Mount Besar Hantu]] as the highest point. The Titiwangsa also ends here, at [[Mount Tampin]], located south of the state.

The capital of Negeri Sembilan is [[Seremban]]. The royal capital is [[Seri Menanti]] in [[Kuala Pilah District]]. Other important towns are [[Port Dickson]], [[Bahau]] and [[Nilai]].

The economy of Negeri Sembilan is mainly based on agriculture, manufacturing and [[service sector|services]]. [[Seremban District|Seremban]] and [[Port Dickson District|Port Dickson Districts]] are the state's major economic hubs, both constituting the [[Malaysia Vision Valley]] corridor.

The name is believed to derive from the nine (''sembilan'') villages or ''[[Nagari (settlement)|nagari]]'' in the [[Minangkabau language]] (now known as ''luak'') settled by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] (or ''Menangkabau<ref name=":0" />''), a people originally from [[West Sumatra]] (in present-day Indonesia). Minangkabau features are still visible today in [[Minangkabau architecture|traditional architecture]] and the [[Negeri Sembilan Malay|dialect of Malay spoken]].

Unlike the hereditary monarchs of the other royal [[Malay states]], the ruler of Negeri Sembilan is [[elective monarchy|elected]] and is known as ''[[Yamtuan Besar|Yang di-Pertuan Besar]]'' instead of [[Sultan]]. He is elected by the council of ''[[Undang|Undangs]]'' who lead the four largest territories of [[Sungai Ujong]], [[Jelebu]], [[Johol]], and [[Rembau District|Rembau]], from the legitimate male members of the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]] dynasty, with the surviving sons of the previous Yamtuan coming first in the considerations but not being obligatory to be voted on, making it one of the more democratic monarchies. Negeri Sembilan is also the only state in Malaysia that is a [[coregency]], where the ''Yang di-Pertuan Besar'', the four ''Undangs'' and the ''Tunku Besar'' of [[Tampin]] together share the power as rulers of the state.

The [[Arabic]] honorific title of the state is '''''Darul Khusus''''' (دار الخصوص; "The Special Abode").<!-- state why this is important to be mentioned, when it was implemented, give cited link(s). ty -->

== Etymology==
The name of Negeri Sembilan literally translates to "State (of the) Nine". It is believed to have been derived from the nine chiefdoms settled by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], known as ''[[Nagari (settlement)|Nogoghi]]'' in the [[Negeri Sembilan Malay|Negeri Sembilan dialect]] and now known as ''luak''. The size of modern Negeri Sembilan is smaller than its historical extent.

===Ancient and medieval history===
The earliest possible human settlement in Negeri Sembilan can be traced back around 14,000 years to the Pasoh Caves, a complex of [[karst cave]]s near [[Simpang Pertang]] in the Jelebu district. Artefacts found around the caves include stone tools and food remains, estimated to date from 12,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] based on [[carbon dating]].<ref>{{Cite news |language=ms |author=Ziauddin Sharuddin |date=22 December 2015 |url=https://www.bharian.com.my/bhplus-old/2015/12/107252/artifak-14000-tahun-di-gua-pelangi-jelebu |title=Penemuan artifak dapat rungkai asal usul Jelebu<!--Print title, meanwhile online title: "Artifak 14,000 tahun di Gua Pelangi, Jelebu"--> |newspaper=Berita Harian |page=4 }}</ref> The early inhabitants of Negeri Sembilan were the ancestors of the [[Semelai people|Semelai]], [[Semai people|Semai]], [[Semang]], and [[Jakun people|Jakun]] peoples, who lived either as [[hunter-gatherer]] nomads or as subsistence farmers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

According to the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', [[Parameswara of Malacca|Parameswara]] reportedly visited the settlement of ''Sening Ujong'', which was located in what is now Seremban.

The Minangkabaus from [[Sumatra]] settled in what is today Negeri Sembilan in the 15th century, under the protection of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] and later the [[Johor Sultanate|Sultanate of Johor]]. They also brought their [[matrilineal]] custom, known as ''[[Adat Perpatih]]'', which became the local custom.<ref name=travel>{{Cite web |url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/ns_historical.htm |title=Negeri Sembilan - History and Culture |access-date=26 October 2014 |archive-date=28 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728154442/http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/ns_historical.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://museumvolunteersjmm.com/2016/04/04/the-minangkabau-of-negeri-sembilan/ |title=The Minangkabau of Negeri Sembilan |date=4 April 2016 |access-date=4 March 2017 |archive-date=5 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705175516/https://museumvolunteersjmm.com/2016/04/04/the-minangkabau-of-negeri-sembilan/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Muar River headwaters.jpg|248px|thumb|Headwaters of the [[Muar River]] near [[Kuala Pilah]]. The Muar, along with the [[Linggi River|Linggi]], was one of the most important trade routes in medieval Negeri Sembilan.]]

The [[Linggi River]] along the western part of the state, and the [[Muar River]] were used as major trade routes since the time of the Malacca Sultanate. The former linked the tin-rich area of Sungai Ujong to the port city of [[Malacca City#History|Malacca]]; while the latter, along with the [[Pahang River]] via the Serting River in walking distance to the east, formed part of the [[Laluan Penarikan]] (lit. 'portage route' in [[Malay language|Malay]]), facilitating access between the Strait of Malacca and the [[South China Sea]].

As Johor weakened in the 18th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} attacks by the [[Bugis]] forced the Minangkabaus to seek protection from their homeland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} The Minangkabau ruler, Sultan Abdul Jalil, obliged by sending his near relative, Raja Mahmud, also known as [[Melewar of Negeri Sembilan|Raja Melewar]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

When Raja Melewar arrived, he found that another royal, Raja Khatib had already established himself as ruler.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} He declared war against Raja Khatib and became the ruler of Negeri Sembilan. The Sultan of Johor confirmed his position by granting the title Yamtuan Seri Menanti (''"He Who is Highest Lord of the Seri Menanti''") in 1773.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

=== Nine chiefdoms ===
At the time of its establishment, Negeri Sembilan was originally a loose confederation of nine chiefdoms (''luaks)'', hence the name. During Raja Melewar's rule, it covered a larger area than its modern-day boundaries. In addition to the entire modern-day Negeri Sembilan, it also encompassed parts of what are now Selangor, Malacca, Pahang and Johor.

The original nine chiefdoms or domains that made up the first incarnation of Negeri Sembilan in 1773,{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} and gave the state its name, were:

# Sungai Ujong
# Jelebu
# Rembau
# Johol
# [[Kuala Pilah|Jelai]]
# [[Bera District|Ulu Pahang]]
# [[Naning]]
# [[Segamat]]
# [[Kuala Langat District|Klang]]

<!-- citation needed for remaining claims -->However, the latter four chiefdoms were annexed into neighbouring states in the 19th century. Naning was incorporated into the [[Straits Settlements|Straits Settlement]] of Malacca in 1832 following the [[Naning War]].

Ulu Pahang became the Bera region of Pahang, Segamat was annexed by Johor, and Klang became part of the Kuala Langat region of Selangor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024|reason=need year when these happened if possible.}}

After Raja Melewar's death in 1795, a series of disputes arose over the succession. For a considerable period, the local nobles appealed to the Minangkabau ruler in Sumatra for a new ruler.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} However, competing interests supported different candidates, often resulting in further instability and civil war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

===Colonial history===
{{further information|Linggi River|Antah of Negeri Sembilan#History}}

In 1874, the [[British Empire|British]] intervened militarily in a leadership tussle in Sungai Ujong to preserve British economic interests and placed the domain under the control of a [[British Resident]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} [[Jelebu]] followed in 1883 and Rembau in 1887.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} Their presence was detested by the locals, which eventually paved the way to a deadly civil war and subsequent breakup.

====Battle of Paroi====
In 1875, British forces, accompanied by Arab mercenaries and [[Gurkha]], engaged Malay defenders in [[Paroi]] at the Battle of Paroi. Despite initial setbacks, the British ultimately prevailed, capturing the Malay stronghold. Casualties were heavy on both sides, with the [[British Army|British]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] contingents suffering 37 killed and wounded, while the Malay had around 35 deaths and many wounded.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Battle of Paroi |url=https://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/perak10.htm |access-date=18 March 2024 |website=www.sabrizain.org |archive-date=18 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240318155018/https://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/perak10.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Battle of Bukit Putus====
After the Battle of Paroi, the British waited for Gurkha reinforcements, which arrived on 10 December 1875. The Malays fortified Bukit Putus, a [[mountain pass]] on the boundary between Sungai Ujong and Terachi. The British attacked Bukit Putus from both the front and back. The Gurkhas successfully captured the Malay stockade at Bukit Putus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Battle of Bukit Putus |url=https://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/perak11.htm |access-date=18 March 2024 |website=www.sabrizain.org }}</ref> The Malays retreated after the surprise appearance of Sungai Ujong Resident P.J. Murray's forces from behind.

====Seri Menanti Confederation, modern Negeri Sembilan and statehood====
The formation of modern Negeri Sembilan began in 1889, when the [[Seri Menanti]] domain, under the rule of [[Muhammad of Negeri Sembilan|Tuanku Muhammad]] (son of [[Antah of Negeri Sembilan|Yamtuan Antah]]), combined with the domains of [[Tampin District|Tampin]] and [[Rembau (town)|Rembau]], forming the ''Seri Menanti Confederation'' as a single political entity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

The domains of Sungai Ujong and Jelebu joined this confederation in 1895, forming the state of Negeri Sembilan in its modern borders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colonial Reports--annual, Issues 1570-1599 |year=1931 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b4cdAAAAMAAJ&q=Seri+Menanti+Confederation+1889&pg=RA22-PA2 |access-date=9 January 2021 }}</ref> [[Martin Lister (British colonial administrator)|Martin Lister]] became the new state's first [[British Resident|Resident]], and Negeri Sembilan became part of the [[Federated Malay States]] the same year.

===Modern history===
In the first half of the 20th century, rural Negeri Sembilan saw large deforestation due to demand for natural rubber (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]''); 6,188 plantations were counted in 1903 and were 396,065 counted in 1939.<ref name="Kato">{{cite journal |author=Tsuyoshi Kato |title=When Rubber Came: The Negeri Sembilan Experience |journal=Southeast Asian Studies |date=Sep 1991 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=149–51 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2433/56440 |publisher=[[Kyoto University]] |hdl=2433/56440 }}</ref> It was [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|occupied by the Japanese]] in [[World War II]] between 1942 and 1945, joined the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1948 and became a state of Malaysia in 1963.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Seremban and Nilai attracted people who migrated from the overcrowded towns of the Klang Valley. These two cities also became home to new factories and industrial parks, contributing to the state's modern development.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}

On 9 September 2009, the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government (Malaysia)|Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] approved the state capital of Seremban's application to become a city (Bandar Raya), as it had experienced significant population growth. To make this possible, [[Seremban City Council|its city council]] had to be merged with the [[Nilai Municipal Council]]. After several postponements, Seremban officially attained city status on 20 January 2020.

Later that same year on 9 November, Negeri Sembilan was placed under the [[Malaysian movement control order|Movement Control Order]] lockdown due to increasing [[COVID-19]] infections.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024|reason=citation for the MCO date needed}}

Facing the [[Strait of Malacca]], Negeri Sembilan is one of the [[Peninsular Malaysia#Other features|West Coast]] states of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. It is specifically part of the southern region, along with Malacca and Johor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Five-Regions-in-Malaysia_fig1_347157656/amp |title=Five Regions in Malaysia &#124; Download Scientific Diagram |access-date=28 September 2022 |archive-date=28 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928173827/https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Five-Regions-in-Malaysia_fig1_347157656/amp |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.travelfish.org/region/malaysia/peninsular_malaysia |title=Peninsular Malaysia travel guide |access-date=28 September 2022 |archive-date=13 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613180528/https://www.travelfish.org/region/malaysia/peninsular_malaysia |url-status=live }}</ref> However, some sources define Negeri Sembilan as a central region state with [[Selangor]] and the federal territories of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Putrajaya]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-Malaysia-showing-the-six-regions_fig1_257142322 |title=Map of Malaysia showing the six regions. &#124; Download Scientific Diagram }}</ref>

The state is slightly smaller than [[Selangor]], with a total land area of 6,686&nbsp;km² (430 sq mi). It is the fourth smallest state in Malaysia by area and the second largest in the southern region behind Johor. Its shape is roughly [[pentagonal]].

=== Topography ===
Topographically, Negeri Sembilan consists of two plains divided by a mountainous spine in the middle. This region is well drained by various rivers on both sides. The [[Titiwangsa Mountains]], the southernmost extension of the [[Tenasserim Hills]] and the wider Indo-Malayan Cordillera, spans approximately 92&nbsp;km (57.1&nbsp;mi) through the middle of the state. The mountain range starts from the border tripoint with [[Pahang]] and [[Selangor]] near Kenaboi, [[Jelebu]], and extends towards [[Tampin]], close to the border with [[Malacca]].<ref>Yaakub Idrus.

This geographical feature results in the state being bisected almost diagonally into two regions; western Negeri Sembilan, consisting of the Port Dickson, Seremban, and Rembau Districts; and eastern Negeri Sembilan, which includes the districts of Jelebu, Kuala Pilah, Jempol, and Tampin. The western half is more developed and has an intricate and concentrated road network compared to the latter, which is predominantly rural.

The Negeri Sembilan section of the Titiwangsa Mountains forms a [[drainage divide|division]] for four river basins. The [[Langat River|Langat]] and [[Linggi River]]s flows through the western half, while the [[Muar River|Muar]] and [[Pahang River]]s constitute the eastern side. The Linggi and Muar rivers are the two major rivers flowing through the state and serve as significant water sources for the population.<ref>Yaakub Idrus.

==== Highest point ====
[[Mount Besar Hantu]], at 1,462&nbsp;m (4,797&nbsp;ft), located in Jelebu District and close to the border with [[Pahang]], is the highest point in Negeri Sembilan. The nearby [[Mount Nuang]], which is 31 metres taller, marks the [[tripoint]] with [[Selangor]] and [[Pahang]] at its northernmost point, of which it is the third tallest in the former; while in the south, [[Mount Ledang]], an [[Inselberg|isolated mountain]], marks the [[tripoint]] with [[Malacca]] and [[Johor]], where it is the highest point of the latter at 1,276&nbsp;m (4,186.3&nbsp;ft).

=== Districts ===
[[File:PenandaSempadanLuakGunungPasir.jpg|thumb|Signboard on the entrance into the ''Luak'' of Gunung Pasir, near [[Seri Menanti]]]]
On the administrative level, Negeri Sembilan consists of seven districts, namely the [[Port Dickson District|Port Dickson]], [[Seremban District|Seremban]], [[Rembau District|Rembau]], [[Kuala Pilah District|Kuala Pilah]], [[Jelebu District|Jelebu]], [[Jempol District|Jempol]] and [[Tampin District]]s.

The state is also has 14 ''luaks'' which are: [[Sungai Ujong]], Rembau, Jelebu, [[Johol]], [[Tampin (town)#History|Tampin]], [[:ms:Ulu Muar|Ulu Muar]], [[:ms:Terachi|Terachi]], [[:ms:Inas|Ineh]], Jempol, [[:ms:Gunung Pasir|Gunung Pasir]], [[Gemencheh]], [[:ms:Pasir Besar|Pasir Besar]], [[Ayer Kuning]], and [[Linggi]].

Sungai Ujong, Rembau, Johol and Jelebu are governed by the ''[[Undangs]]'', thus they are known as the ''Luak Berundang''. In addition, there are four ''luaks'' that are [[Protectorate|protected]] under two of the ''Luak Berundang'', which are Gemencheh, Ayer Kuning and Pasir Besar, which are protectorates of Johol; as well as Linggi, a protectorate of Sungai Ujong.

The ''luaks'' surrounding [[Seri Menanti]] such as Terachi, Ulu Muar, Jempol, Gunung Pasir and Ineh are collectively known as the ''Luak Tanah Mengandung''.

Lastly, the Luak of Tampin, also known as the ''Adat'' Territory of Tampin (Malay: ''Wilayah Adat Tampin''), holds a semi-autonomous status and is ruled by the [[Tunku Besar]].<ref>{{cite web |date=25 December 2018 |title=SeNanti@SeriMenanti: Pengertian Dan Senarai Luak-Luak Dalam Negeri Sembilan |url=http://serimenanti.blogspot.com/2018/12/pengertian-dan-senarai-luak-luak-dalam.html?m=1 |access-date=30 September 2022 |archive-date=30 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220930181122/http://serimenanti.blogspot.com/2018/12/pengertian-dan-senarai-luak-luak-dalam.html?m=1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=8 November 2018 |title=Sistem Sosial Adat Perpatih di Negeri Sembilan - the Patriots |url=https://www.thepatriots.asia/sistem-sosial-adat-perpatih-di-negeri-sembilan/ }}</ref>

===Climate===
Negeri Sembilan experiences [[equatorial climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''''Af'''''), which is hot and humid all year round. [[Thunderstorms]] are mostly prevalent during the period of [[monsoonal]] transitions that occur twice a year.

Dry seasons usually starts shortly after the first monsoonal transition and lasts until August to September, as the moisture brought by the southwesterly [[Monsoon#Global monsoon|Indo-Australian Monsoon]] are blocked by the [[Barisan Mountains]] in [[Sumatera]], creating a [[rainshadow effect]] on the eastern coast of the island and the [[Malay Peninsula]].

In the corresponding [[Monsoon#Global monsoon|Borneo-Australian Monsoon]] that blows from the northeast, Negeri Sembilan, along with the states of Melaka, Johor, and the [[Peninsular Malaysia#Other features|East Coast]] states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang are the most affected by the monsoonal surge that brings persistently heavy rainfall and cause rough sea conditions in the [[South China Sea]].

==Government==

===Constitution===
The Constitution of Negeri Sembilan came into force on 26 March 1959. It is divided into two sections. The constitution establishes that the state's form of government is [[constitutional monarchy]] and the world's only [[elective monarchy]] for a matrilineal society.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}} The system was partially the basis for the federal monarchy.

===The Ruler===
[[File:Istana Besar Seri Menanti.jpg|thumb|[[Istana Seri Menanti#Istana Besar|Istana Besar]] in [[Seri Menanti]], the official residence of the Yamtuan Besar]]
[[File:Seremban.JPG|thumb|[[Seremban]], capital of Negeri Sembilan]]
The official constitutional title of the Ruler of the state are [[Malay titles|Duli Yang Maha Mulia]] [[Yamtuan Besar|Yang di-Pertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan]], (currently Duli Yang Maha Mulia Yang di-Pertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan Darul Khusus Tuanku Muhriz ibni Almarhum Tuanku Munawir), Yang Teramat Mulia Undang of Sungei Ujong, Yang Teramat Mulia Undang of Jelebu, Yang Teramat Mulia Undang of Johol, Yang Teramat Mulia Undang of Rembau and Yang Teramat Mulia Tengku Besar Tampin and they hold office for life.

The state's constitution proclaims the Yang di-Pertuan Besar, Undang of Sungei Ujong, Undang of Jelebu, Undang of Johol, Undang of Rembau and Tengku Besar Tampin are vested with the Executive Power of the state, are the Head of the Religion of [[Islam]] in the state and are the fountain of all honour and dignity for the state. The current Yang di-Pertuan Besar is [[Muhriz of Negeri Sembilan]]. He succeeded [[Ja'afar of Negeri Sembilan]] who died on 27 December 2008.

Unlike Malaysia's eight other Royal Malay states, the Ruler of Negeri Sembilan is elected to his office by the territorial chiefs or Ruling Chiefs of the state. These Ruling Chiefs are titled Undang. Only four of the [[Undang]]s have the right to vote in the election for the Ruler of the State. They are:

* The Undang of Sungai Ujong
* The Undang of Jelebu
* The Undang of Johol
* The Undang of Rembau

The Undang themselves cannot stand for election, and their choice of Ruler is limited to a male Muslim who is Malay and also a "lawfully begotten descendant of Raja Radin ibni Raja Lenggang".

The Assembly convenes at the [[Wisma Negeri, Negeri Sembilan|Wisma Negeri]] in the state capital, [[Seremban]].

=== Executive and Legislature ===
{{main|Negeri Sembilan State Executive Council|Negeri Sembilan State Legislative Assembly}}
{{see also|Menteri Besar of Negeri Sembilan}}
[[File:Wisma negri seremban.jpg|thumb|[[Wisma Negeri, Negeri Sembilan|Wisma Negeri]], [[Seremban]]]]

The State Executive Council consists of the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), who is its chairman, and ten other members. The Menteri Besar and the other members of the council are appointed by the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar from the members of the State Assembly of the governing party or coalition. The current [[Menteri Besar of Negeri Sembilan|Menteri Besar]] of the state is [[Aminuddin Harun]].

The unicameral [[Negeri Sembilan State Legislative Assembly]] is the [[Dewan Undangan Negeri|state legislature]] of Negeri Sembilan. It consists of 36 members who represent [[single-member constituencies]] throughout the state. [[Elections in Malaysia|Elections]] are held no more than five years apart, and are usually conducted simultaneously with elections to the [[Dewan Rakyat|federal parliament]].

The Negeri Sembilanese people speak a unique variety of [[Malay language|Malay]] known as [[Negeri Sembilan Malay]] or in their native language as Baso Nogoghi. It is not closely related to other varieties of Malay in Peninsular Malaysia but is more closely related with Malay varieties spoken in neighbouring [[Sumatra]] especially [[Minangkabau language|varieties of Minangkabau]]. Besides Malays, the Chinese community also speak their languages and dialects. [[Orang Asli]] peoples like [[Temuan people|Temuans]] speak a [[Temuan language|language]] closely related to Malay. [[Malaysian language|Standard Malay]] is widely used throughout the state.

[[Tamil language|Tamil]] (mother tongue to Indian Tamils and Ceylon Tamils) is used as a lingua franca among the other minor Indian communities. Besides, a small number of [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] exist in the towns of Negeri Sembilan.

[[File:Sime Darby Plantations Ladang Salak Divisyen Sendayan (220709).jpg|thumb|[[Sime Darby]] oil palm estate in [[Port Dickson District]]]]
The state's manufacturing sector contributes almost half of the state's gross domestic product (GDP), followed by services and tourism (40.3%), agriculture (6%), construction (2.2%) and mining (0.3%). Manufacturing activities include electrical supplies and electronics, textiles, furniture, chemicals, machinery, metal works and rubber products. The main industrial areas in Negeri Sembilan include [[Senawang]], [[Bandar Sri Sendayan]], [[Sungai Gadut]], [[Bandar Enstek]] and [[Nilai]] in [[Seremban District|Seremban]], Tanah Merah in [[Port Dickson District|Port Dickson]] and [[Chembong]] in [[Rembau District|Rembau]]. Notable companies also set up plants in Negeri Sembilan, such as [[Kellogg's]], [[Dutch Lady]], [[Ajinomoto]] and [[Coca-Cola]] in Bandar Enstek, [[Hino Motors]] in Bandar Sri Sendayan, [[Yakult]] in [[Seremban 2]], [[Samsung SDI]], [[Onsemi]] and [[NXP Semiconductors]] in Senawang, and [[Nestlé]] in Chembong. Nestlé's Chembong plant is also the largest [[Milo (drink)|Milo]] manufacturer in the world, as well as the company's largest global centre of excellence.

Negeri Sembilan is mainly an agricultural state. However, the establishment of several industrial estates enhanced the manufacturing sector as a significant contributor to the state economy. Two districts in the western half of the state – [[Seremban District|Seremban]] and [[Port Dickson District|Port Dickson]] – have been gazetted as part of the [[Malaysia Vision Valley]], a {{convert|1534|km²}} new growth corridor conceived from the joint venture between [[Sime Darby]] and both the federal and state governments in 2015 as part of the National Transformation Agenda, the National Physical Plan, the [[Eleventh Malaysia Plan]] and the 2045 Negeri Sembilan Structural Plan, in order to evenly balancing the existing development in the neighbouring [[Klang Valley]] area, providing ample space for the southern extension of the [[Greater Kuala Lumpur]] area, as well as to transform Negeri Sembilan into a developed state by 2045.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/05/22/negri-proposes-rm640bil-partnership-with-federal-govt/ |title=Negri proposes RM640bil partnership with Federal Govt |access-date=9 September 2022 |archive-date=6 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241006080140/https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/05/22/negri-proposes-rm640bil-partnership-with-federal-govt/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://jpbd.ns.gov.my/perkhidmatan/rancangan-pemajuan/rancangan-struktur-negeri |title=PLANMalaysia@Negeri Sembilan - Rancangan Struktur Negeri |access-date=9 September 2022 |archive-date=9 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220909144815/https://jpbd.ns.gov.my/perkhidmatan/rancangan-pemajuan/rancangan-struktur-negeri |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thesundaily.my/business/malaysia-vision-valley-2-0-officially-launched-nine-years-on-EN258024 |title=Malaysia Vision Valley 2.0 officially launched, nine years on |access-date=9 September 2022 |archive-date=9 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220909145759/https://www.thesundaily.my/business/malaysia-vision-valley-2-0-officially-launched-nine-years-on-EN258024 |url-status=live }}</ref> As of 2024, the MVV is now in its second iteration, and is still undergoing development.

==Culture==
{{see also|Adat perpatih|list of Minangkabau clans}}
The [[Minangkabau people]] brought with them a cultural heritage which is still preserved and practised today as the ''[[adat perpatih]]'', a [[matrilineal]] system of [[inheritance]] and administration that is unique to the state, where the husband is the head of the household and inheritance passes from mother to daughter. The Minangkabaus in Negeri Sembilan are divided into twelve ''[[Minangkabau clans|suku]]'' (clans). Each of these ''suku'' is led by a chief, known as the ''Lembaga''. Each ''suku'' is broken down into subunits known as the ''Perut'', where each of them are led by a chief, either known as a ''Buapak'' (male) or ''Ibu Soko'' (female). Both the ''Buapak'' and ''Ibu Soko'' play a vital role as people to refer to regarding the ''adat'' and religious matters among the subordinates of the ''Perut'', known as ''Anak Buah''. Marriage between members of the same clan is forbidden. The twelve ''suku'' are known as the following, of which the names of each ''suku'' indicates their area of origin:
* ''Biduanda''
* ''Seri Lemak''
* ''Seri Melenggang''
* ''Anak Aceh''
* ''Anak Melaka''
* ''Tiga Nenek''
* ''Tiga Batu''
* ''Tanah Datar''
* ''Batu Hampar''
* ''Payakumbuh''
* ''Batu Belang''
* ''Mungkal''

The Minangkabau influence in the state can be found in dances and food as well.

The musical instruments used to bear some semblance to [[Sumatra]], the ancestral home of the [[Minangkabau people]]. Dances like the tarian lilin (candle dance) and rentak kuda (the beat of the horse) are popular in Negeri Sembilan and the coordinated movements of the dancers in their colorful costumes in the [[Tari Piring|Tarian Piring]] and the upbeat tempo of [[Randai|Tarian Randai]]. Each [[Beat (music)|beat]], [[rhythm]] and [[Kinesiology|movement]] in these dances combines to form a story, maybe of a bygone myth or simply a reflection of the lifestyles of another era.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

They are usually performed at traditional festivities, cultural events and dinner-cum-cultural shows.
