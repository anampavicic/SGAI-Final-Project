'''Haarlemmermeer''' ({{IPA|nl|ˌɦaːrlɛmərˈmeːr|-|397 Haarlemmermeer.ogg}}) is a [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the west of the [[Netherlands]], in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Holland]]. Haarlemmermeer is a [[polder]], consisting of land reclaimed from water. The name Haarlemmermeer means '[[Haarlem]]'s lake', referring to the body of water from which the region was reclaimed in the 19th century.

Haarlemmermeer's main town is [[Hoofddorp]], which has a population of 76,660. Hoofddorp, along with the rapidly growing towns of [[Nieuw-Vennep]] and [[Badhoevedorp]], are part of the [[Randstad]] agglomeration. The main international airport of the Netherlands, [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol]], is located in Haarlemmermeer.

==History==
[[File:Gem-Haarlemmermeer-OpenTopo.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Haarlemmermeer, June 2015]]
The original Haarlemmermeer lake is said to have been mostly a [[peat bog]], a relic of a northern arm of the [[Rhine]] which passed through the district in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. In 1531, the original Haarlemmermeer had an area of {{convert|26.0|km2|mi2}}, and near it were three smaller lakes: the Leidsche Meer ([[Leiden]] Lake), the Spiering Meer, and the Oude Meer (Old Lake), with a combined area of about {{convert|31|km2|mi2}}.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Haarlem Lake|volume=12|pages=781–782 |inline=1}}</ref>

The four lakes were formed into one by successive floods with the Haarlemmermeer name being applied to the combined lake. Villages disappeared in the process. One of those villages was Vennep, after which the modern [[Nieuw-Vennep]] was named. In Dutch, the tendency for lakes to grow over time is called the [[waterwolf]]. During the [[Dutch War of Independence]], the waters of the Haarlemmermeer were the scene of the [[Battle of Haarlemmermeer]], a naval engagement between a Spanish fleet and the ships of the Dutch rebels known as "[[Geuzen|Sea Beggars]]", who were trying to break the [[Siege of Haarlem]].

[[File:Oude Haarlemmermeer.jpg|thumb|left|Historic map of the Haarlemmermeer before reclamation.]]
The Haarlemmermeer could be a dangerous place during storms. On 7 January 1629, [[Frederick Henry of the Palatinate]], son and heir of [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]], the "Winter King" drowned trying to cross it. By 1647, the new Haarlemmermeer had an area of about {{convert|150|km2|mi2}}, which a century later had increased to over {{convert|170|km2|mi2}}.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1643, [[Jan Leeghwater|Jan Adriaanszoon Leeghwater]] proposed to [[dike (construction)|dike]] and drain the lake. Similar schemes, among which those of [[Nicolaas Kruik|Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius]] in 1742 and of Baron van Lijnden van Hemmen in 1820, were proposed from time to time. But it was not until a furious [[European windstorm|hurricane]] in November 1836 drove the waters as far as the gates of [[Amsterdam]], and another on Christmas Day sent them in the opposite direction to submerge the streets of [[Leiden]], that the matter was seriously considered.<ref name=EB1911/>

On 1 August 1837, [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] appointed a royal commission of inquiry. Their proposal receiving the sanction of the [[Dutch Parliament]]'s [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Second Chamber]] in March 1839, and in the following May the work was begun.<ref name=EB1911/>

First, a canal was dug around the lake, called ''[[Ringvaart]]'' (Ring Canal), to carry the water drainage and boat and ship traffic which had previously gone across the lake. This canal was {{convert|61|km|mi}} long, <!-- 23.6 miles (38 km) wide, -- impossible, to be verified -->and {{convert|2.40|m|ft}} deep, and the excavated earth was used to build a dike from {{convert|30|to|50|m|ft}} wide around the lake. The area enclosed by the canal was more than {{convert|180|km2|mi2}}, and the average depth of the lake {{convert|4|m|ft}}. As the water had no natural drainage, it was calculated that probably 1000 million tons of water would have to be raised by mechanical means.<ref name=EB1911/>

[[File:Pumping engine Cruquius.jpg|thumb|Pumping Station Cruquius]]
All of the pumping was done by steam mills, an innovation contrasting with the historic practice of draining polders using [[windmill]]s. Three Cornish [[beam engine]]s were imported from [[Hayle]]: the [[Leeghwater]], the [[Museum De Cruquius|Cruquius]] (the largest Watt-design reciprocal stroke steam engine ever built and now a museum), and the [[:Image:Lijnden gemaal.jpg|Lijnden]]. Pumping began in 1848, and the lake was dry by July 1, 1852; 800 million tons of water were actually discharged. At the first sale of the highest lands along the banks on 16 August 1853, about £28 per acre was paid; but the average price afterwards was less. The whole area of {{convert|170.36|km2|mi2}} recovered from the waters brought in 9,400,000 guilders, or about £780,000, exactly covering the cost of the enterprise; so that the actual cost to the nation was only the amount of the interest on the capital, or about £368,000.<ref name=EB1911/>

The soil is of various kinds, loam, clay, sand, and peat. Most of it is fertile enough, though in the lower portions there are barren patches where the scanty vegetation is covered with an [[ochre]]ous deposit. Mineral springs occur containing a very high percentage (3.245 grams per litre) of [[Sodium chloride|common salt]]; and in 1893 a company was formed to work them.

In 1854, the city of [[Leiden]] laid claim to the possession of the new territory, but the courts decided in favor of the nation.<ref name=EB1911/> Haarlemmermeer became incorporated as a municipality in the province of [[North Holland]] by law on 16 July 1855. Its first mayor was Matthijs Samuel Petrus Pabst. The first church was built in the same year and by 1877 there were seven. By 1860 its population was 7237, and 40 years later in 1900, it was 16,621.

Initially agriculture dominated in Haarlemmermeer. But with 99% of the land owned by a few wealthy land owners, poor harvests and low [[commodity]] prices, life was very difficult for the [[tenant farmers]]. After 1900, the situation improved when commodity prices rose and most farmers owned their own land. Then [[greenhouse]] farming developed. Seasonal labourers, attracted by good pay, boosted the population by settling in the villages along the Ringvaart. Maize, seeds, cattle, butter, and cheese were the principal produce. Today, large industrial and office developments have become prominent, especially at Hoofddorp and Schiphol.

The roads which traverse the commune are bordered by pleasant-looking farmhouses built after the various styles of [[Holland]], [[Friesland]] and [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], reflecting the various origins of the farmers. Hoofddorp, Venneperdorp or Nieuw-Vennep, Abbenes, and the vicinities of the [[pumping station]]s are the spots where the population has clustered most densely.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1917 a military airport was built near the old fort of Schiphol. Nowadays, [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol Airport]] is the major civilian aviation hub in the Netherlands, using 15% of Haarlemmermeer's land area. In 1926, [[Amsterdam]]'s municipal council took over the management of Schiphol. After [[Stockholm-Bromma Airport|Stockholm's airport]], Schiphol was the second airport in Europe to have hardened runways, in 1937–1938. The name ''Schiphol'' means "ship hole" and refers to the many ships lost due to storms in the former lake.

In the first half of the 20th century, a number of [[Haarlemmermeer railway lines|steam railway lines]] were built in Haarlemmermeer; most were abandoned only a couple of decades later. On 1 January 2019, the municipality of [[Haarlemmerliede en Spaarnwoude]] merged with Haarlemmermeer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/classificaties/overig/gemeentelijke-indelingen-per-jaar/indeling%20per%20jaar/gemeentelijke-indeling-op-1-januari-2019|title=Gemeentelijke indeling op 1 januari 2019|language=nl|publisher=CBS|access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref>

==Population centres==
The municipality of Haarlemmermeer contains the following cities, towns and villages: [[Aalsmeerderbrug]], [[Abbenes]], [[Badhoevedorp]], [[Beinsdorp]], [[Boesingheliede]], [[Buitenkaag]], [[Burgerveen]], [[Cruquius, North Holland|Cruquius]], [[De Hoek, Netherlands|De Hoek]], [[Haarlemmerliede]], [[Halfweg]], [[Hoofddorp]], [['t Kabel]], [[Leimuiderbrug]], [[Lijnden]], [[Lisserbroek]], [[Nieuwe Meer]], [[Nieuwebrug, North Holland|Nieuwebrug]], [[Nieuw-Vennep]], [[Oude Meer]], [[Penningsveer]], [[Rijsenhout]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Rozenburg, North Holland|nl|3=Rozenburg (Noord-Holland)}}, [[Schiphol]], [[Schiphol-Rijk]], [[Spaarndam]] (partly), [[Spaarnwoude]], [[Vijfhuizen]], [[Vinkebrug]], [[Weteringbrug]], [[Zwaanshoek]], [[Zwanenburg]].

==Monuments and parks==
[[File:Brokstuk-gemaal-blijdorp-polder.jpg|right|thumb|Cruquiusmuseum entrance, taken from Cruquiusmuseum park]]

* [[Stelling van Amsterdam]] – the old defense line of Amsterdam crosses the Haarlemmermeer. Plans are being made to make this entire defense line walkable, but currently it is not possible to cross the major highway A4 that goes through it. This park is accessible at various points for recreation, including the Haarlemmermeer Woods.
* Haarlemmermeer Woods (Dutch: 'Haarlemmermeerse Bos') – the largest public park in Haarlemmermeer and site of the International garden show [[Floriade 2002]], the park includes a large lake for swimming in the summer and a 40-meter manmade hill called Spotter's Hill. The Haarlemmermeer Woods is home to events such as horse shows and the [[Mysteryland]] music festival.
* [[Museum De Cruquius]] – the Cruquius museum resides in one of the steam mills used to pump the Haarlemmermeer dry and is open to the public for a demonstration of the steam engine and a model of the Netherlands waterways and polders. Because the Cruquius steam engine is the largest ever built, the museum is an Anchor Point of ERIH, The [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]]. Behind the museum is a park.

==Transportation==

===Roadways===
One of the busiest [[freeway]]s in the Netherlands, the [[A4 motorway (Netherlands)|A4]] from Amsterdam to Den Haag, crosses right through Haarlemmermeer. Other freeways are the [[A5 motorway (Netherlands)|A5]], from Hoofddorp to Amsterdam Sloterdijk, [[A9 motorway (Netherlands)|A9]] from Alkmaar to Diemen and the [[A44 motorway (Netherlands)|A44]], from Nieuw-Vennep to Wassenaar.

====Calatrava bridges====
[[File:Calatrava-Bréck-Citer--w.jpg|thumb|right|Calatrava bridge – Cittern]]
In the presence of HM [[Queen Beatrix]], in 2004 three [[bridge]]s designed by the [[Spain|Spanish]] architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] were opened. The bridges [[Span (architecture)|span]] the main [[canal]] of the Haarlemmermeer and are named after three [[string instrument]]s; [[Harp]], [[Cittern]], and [[Lute]].
In 2006 two of those bridges' structures already displayed clear signs of corrosion, and had to be repaired.

===Aviation===
[[File:Amsterdam Schiphol Airport entry.jpg|thumb|[[Schiphol Airport]]]]
[[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], the principal international airport of the Netherlands, is also situated in Haarlemmermeer.

===Railway===
{{See also|Weesp–Leiden railway}}

[[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], the Dutch National Railways, serves the municipality with three stations: [[Hoofddorp railway station|Hoofddorp]], [[Nieuw-Vennep railway station|Nieuw-Vennep]], and [[Schiphol Airport railway station|Schiphol Airport]] (which serves high speed rail as well).

There was a network of local steam railways across Harlemmermeer in the early 20th century, the [[Haarlemmermeer railway lines]].
{{Railway Leiden Centraal to Schiphol}}

===Water transport===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
The Ringvaart is an important waterway for commercial and recreational boats alike. A portion of it forms part of the sailroute from [[Hollands Diep]] to the [[IJsselmeer]], passable for ships with masts over 6 meters tall. There is also a connection to the Kaag Lake system ([[Kagerplassen]]), which extends to Leiden and beyond.

There are several canals within Haarlemmermeer itself, the main ones are Hoofdvaart (Main Canal) and Kruisvaart (Cross Canal). But these had initially no connection to the outside waterways, meaning that goods had to be reloaded at the ring dike. In 1895 a double [[Lock (water transport)|canal lock]] was built at [[Aalsmeer]], boosting the economy. In the 1950s this lock was closed and the canals are once again no longer used for shipping.

==Government==

===City council===
[[File:Raadzaal Haarlemmermeer.jpg|thumb|Boardroom of the City Council in Hoofddorp]]
