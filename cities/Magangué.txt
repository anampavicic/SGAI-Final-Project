== History ==
Studies and research are still in their infancy, there are only approaches and assumptions based on interpretations of the records left by some writers and settlers who came from Spain. Most of them assert that original population were indigenous belonging to the family Chimilas Carib language that inhabited the extensive river and lake region of Bolivar, Sucre, Magdalena and Cesar departments. The highest regional authority was the Chimilas Mompox and her chiefdoms: Maguey, Yati, or Simacoa Tacaloa, etc. Guazo. Indigenous had an average height of 1.65 meters, were more or less heavyset, had black hair, short legs, dark skin and short prominent nose. Despite speaking a language related to that of the Carib people, who were warlike and resisted the Spaniards, the Maguey were peaceful and docile. They mainly engaged in the farming of cassava and corn and were also experts in fishing and hunting. Both men and women engaged in these tasks.
