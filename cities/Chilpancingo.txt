'''Chilpancingo de los Bravo''' (commonly shortened to '''Chilpancingo'''; {{IPA|es|tʃilpanˈsiŋɡo|-|ChilpancingoPronunciation.ogg}}; [[Nahuatl]]:  Chilpantzinco ({{IPA-nah|t͡ʃiɬpanˈt͡siŋko|pron}})) is the capital and second-largest city of the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Guerrero]]. In 2010 it had a population of 187,251 people. The municipality has an area of {{convert|2,338.4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the south-central part of the state, situated in the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] mountains, on the bank of the [[Huacapa River]].<ref name="EB">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111522/Chilpancingo|title=Chilpancingo|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=18 September 2014}}</ref> The city is on [[Mexican Federal Highway 95|Federal Highway 95]], which connects [[Acapulco]] to [[Mexico City]]. It is served by [[Chilpancingo National Airport]], which is one of the five airports in the state.

==History==
In pre-Columbian times, the area was occupied by the [[Olmecs]], who built an extensive tunnel network through the mountains, and left the cave paintings in the caverns of [[Juxtlahuaca]].<ref name="EB"/> The city of Chilpancingo was founded on 1 November 1591 by the Spanish [[conquistadores]], its name meaning "Place of Wasps" in Nahuatl.<ref name="EB"/> During the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]], Chilpancingo was crucial to the insurgent cause as its population participated actively and decisively in their favor, and it became a strategic point for military action in the south. Chilpancingo was very important to Mexican history because it was here where the [[Congress of Chilpancingo|National Congress]] met under [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] in 1813 during the War of Independence.<ref name="MillsTaylor2002">{{cite book|last1=Mills|first1=Kenneth R.|last2=Taylor|first2=William B.|last3=Graham|first3=Sandra Lauderdale|title=Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jssW4BK6h7cC&pg=PA397|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2997-1|page=397}}</ref>
 
General [[Nicolás Catalán]], husband of the independence war heroine [[Antonia Nava de Catalán]], was made commander of the state of Guerrero on 24 January 1828. The family settled in Chilpancingo, where both Nicolás and Antonia later died.<ref>{{citation|language=es|title=Antonia Nava de Catalán, la Generala|date=19 November 2017|journal=Ecos de la Costa|last=Acuña Cepeda|first=Mirtea Elizabeth|url=https://www.ecosdelacosta.mx/2017/11/19/antonia-nava-catalan-la-generala/|access-date=2017-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201142014/https://www.ecosdelacosta.mx/2017/11/19/antonia-nava-catalan-la-generala/|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
In 1853, Chilpancingo was declared the provisional capital of the state, due to an epidemic that struck the then capital of [[Tixtla]], and regional ecclesiastical organizational changes were made at the same time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z00LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA7|year=1966|publisher=American Philosophical Society|page=7|isbn = 9781422374764|issn=0065-9746}}</ref> In 1870 it was again declared capital by Governor Francisco O. Arce, due to the opposition led by General Jiménez, who was in possession of the official seat of government at Tixtla. It was not until 1871, when the state legislature agreed to a change of venue, that the capital was moved again from Chilpancingo.<ref name="MX">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/EMM12guerrero/municipios/12029a.html|title=Chilpancingo de los Bravo|publisher=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|access-date=18 September 2014|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105233721/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/EMM12guerrero/municipios/12029a.html|archive-date=5 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], Chilpancingo was deeply troubled and had political and administrative importance as a strategic place for the sides in the debate. Battles took place in the vicinity in the 1910s, in which [[Emiliano Zapata]] defeated federal forces of [[Porfirio Díaz]], [[Francisco I. Madero]], [[Victoriano Huerta]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. A major defeat of Huerta's southern forces took place here in March-April 1914;<ref name="O'Kane2000">{{cite book|last=O'Kane|first=Rosemary H.

In 1960, the city entered a severe social crisis with the start of a student popular movement at the [[Autonomous University of Guerrero]], protests which led to a general strike at the institution and later swarmed to various forces and social sectors of the city and the state.<ref name="Selee2011">{{cite book|last=Selee|first=Andrew D.|title=Decentralization, Democratization, and Informal Power in Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7fCyi5u3nIC&pg=PA83|year=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04843-7|page=83}}</ref> The main objective was to diminish the power of the state government and seek autonomy for the college. On 27 April 2009 an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.6 was centered near Chilpancingo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/27/mexico-earthquake-felt-in_n_191822.html|title=Mexico Earthquake: Felt In Mexico City, Centered Near Chilpancingo|work=Huffington Post|date=28 May 2009|access-date=18 September 2014}}</ref>

On 6 October 2024, mayor [[Alejandro Arcos]] was beheaded just six days after taking office, allegedly by drug cartels. His murder came three days after Francisco Tapia, the city government's secretary, was shot to death.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mexican mayor murdered days after starting job |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dj0833g99o |access-date=2024-10-07 |website=www.bbc.com |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Kieran |title=Mexican mayor 'decapitated by drug gangs' six days into job |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/mexican-mayor-decapitated-drug-gangs-144315752.html |website=Yahoo News |access-date=10 October 2024 |date=7 October 2024}}</ref>
