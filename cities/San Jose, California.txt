== Name ==
San Jose is named after {{langnf|es|el Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe|the Town of [[Saint Joseph]] of [[Guadalupe River (California)|Guadalupe]]}}, the city's predecessor, which was eventually located in the area of what is now the [[Plaza de César Chávez]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, some residents and officials advocated for returning to the original spelling of "San José", with the [[acute accent]] on the "e", to acknowledge the city's Mexican origin and [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] population.

By convention, the spelling ''San José'' is only used when the name is spelled in mixed upper- and lowercase letters, but not when the name is spelled only in uppercase letters, as on the city logo. The accent reflects the Spanish version of the name, and the dropping of accents in all-capital writing was once typical in Spanish. While San José is commonly spelled both with and without the acute accent over the "e", the city's official guidelines indicate that it should be spelled with the accent most of the time and sets forth narrow exceptions, such as when the spelling is in URLs, when the name appears in all-capital letters, when the name is used on social media sites where the diacritical mark does not render properly, and where San Jose is part of the proper name of another organization or business, such as [[San Jose Chamber of Commerce]], that has chosen not to use the accent-marked name.<ref>{{cite book |title=City of San José Style Guide |publisher=City of San José |date=July 2000 |access-date=February 5, 2017 |page=21 |url=https://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/40634#page=21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203063924/http://sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/40634#page=21 |archive-date=February 3, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Council Memo Format Guidelines |publisher=San José Public Works Department |date=August 2016 |access-date=February 5, 2017 |page=15 |url=https://cpms.sanjoseca.gov/CPMSDocLib/Online_docs/pw_forms/Council%20memo%20guidelines%20August%202016.pdf#page=15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229135304/https://cpms.sanjoseca.gov/CPMSDocLib/Online_docs/pw_forms/Council%20memo%20guidelines%20August%202016.pdf#page=15 |archive-date=December 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/ |title=San Jose CA, Official website |access-date=February 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723231321/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/ |archive-date=July 23, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the era of [[History of California before 1900#Spanish colonization and governance (1697–1821)|Spanish colonization]] and the subsequent building of [[Spanish missions in California]], the Tamien people's lives changed dramatically. From 1777 onward, most of the Tamien people were forcibly enslaved at [[Mission Santa Clara de Asís]] or [[Mission San José (California)|Mission San José]] where they were baptized and educated to be Catholic ''neophytes'', also known as [[Mission Indians]]. This continued until the mission was secularized by the Mexican Government in 1833. A large majority of the Tamien died either from disease in the missions, or as a result of the [[California genocide|state sponsored genocide]]. Some surviving families remained intact, migrating to Santa Cruz after their ancestral lands were granted to Spanish and Mexican Immigrants.<ref>For events of 1795–1796, Milliken, 1995:129–134 ("Mass Migration in Winter of 1794–95").

California was claimed as part of the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1542, when explorer [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] charted the [[Californian coast]]. During this time [[Alta California]] and the [[Baja California peninsula]] were administered together as [[Province of Las Californias|Province of the Californias]] ({{langx|es|Provincia de las Californias|link=no}}). For nearly 200 years, the Californias remained a distant frontier region largely controlled by the numerous Native Nations and largely ignored by the government of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] in [[Mexico City]]. Shifting power dynamics in North America—including the British/American victory and acquisition of North America, east of the Mississippi following the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], as well as the start of [[Russian colonization of North America|Russian colonization of northwestern North America]]— prompted Spanish/Mexican authorities to sponsor the [[Portolá expedition|Portolá Expedition]] to survey [[Northern California]] in 1769.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.californiahistory.net/4_PAGES/missions_junipero.htm |title=Junípero Serra |year=2000 |work=California History Online |publisher=California Historical Society |access-date=June 20, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040812151444/http://www.californiahistory.net/4_PAGES/missions_junipero.htm |archive-date = August 12, 2004}}</ref>

In 1776, the Californias were included as part of the Captaincy General of the ''[[Provincias Internas]]'', a large administrative division created by [[José de Gálvez]], Spanish [[Council of the Indies|Minister of the Indies]], in order to provide greater autonomy for the [[Spanish Empire]]'s borderlands. That year, King [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III of Spain]] approved an expedition by [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] to survey the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], in order to choose the sites for two future settlements and their accompanying [[Spanish missions in California|mission]]. De Anza initially chose the site for a military settlement in San Francisco, for the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Royal Presidio of San Francisco]], and [[Mission San Francisco de Asís]]. On his way back to Mexico from San Francisco, de Anza chose the sites in [[Santa Clara Valley]] for a civilian settlement, San Jose, on the eastern bank of the [[Guadalupe River (California)|Guadalupe River]], and a mission on its western bank, [[Mission Santa Clara de Asís]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Edward F.

In 1800, due to the growing population in the northern part of the Californias, [[Diego de Borica]], Governor of the Californias, officially split the province into two parts: [[Alta California]] (''Upper California''), which would eventually become several western [[U.S. states]], and [[Baja California]] (''Lower California''), which would eventually become two [[States of Mexico|Mexican states]].

San Jose became part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] in 1821, after [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's War of Independence]] was won against the [[Spanish Crown]], and in 1824, part of the [[First Mexican Republic]]. With its newfound independence, and the triumph of the republican movement, Mexico set out to diminish the [[Catholic Church]]'s power within Alta California by [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularizing the California missions]] in 1833.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1824, in order to promote settlement and economic activity within sparsely populated California, the Mexican government began an initiative, for Mexican and foreign citizens alike, to settle unoccupied lands in California. Between 1833 and 1845, thirty-eight [[Ranchos of California|rancho land grants]] were issued in the [[Santa Clara Valley]], 15 of which were located within modern-day San Jose's borders. Numerous prominent historical figures were among those granted rancho lands in the Santa Valley, including [[James Alexander Forbes (1805–1881)|James A. Forbes]], founder of [[Los Gatos, California]] (granted [[Rancho Potrero de Santa Clara]]), [[Antonio Suñol]], [[Alcalde]] of San Jose (granted [[Rancho Los Coches (Sunol)|Rancho Los Coches]]), and [[José María Alviso]], [[Alcalde]] of San Jose (granted [[Rancho Milpitas]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1835, San Jose's population of approximately 700 people included 40 foreigners, primarily [[Americans]] and [[Englishmen]].

By the end of 1847, the [[Conquest of California]] by the United States was complete, as the [[Mexican–American War]] came to an end.<ref name="NRHP"/> In 1848, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] formally ceded California to the United States, as part of the [[Mexican Cession]]. On December 15, 1849, San Jose became the capital of the [[Territories of the United States#Formerly unorganized territories|unorganized territory]] of [[California]]. With California's [[Admission to the Union]] on September 9, 1850, San Jose became the state's first capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/architecture-and-history/california-state-capitol-history-part-one |title= California State Capitol History: Part 1 |website=California Capitol Museum |access-date=November 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116170240/http://www.capitolmuseum.ca.gov/architecture-and-history/california-state-capitol-history-part-one |archive-date=November 16, 2017 }}</ref>

On March 27, 1850, San Jose was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]].

In the period 1900 through 1910, San Jose served as a center for pioneering invention, innovation, and impact in both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air flight. These activities were led principally by [[John Joseph Montgomery|John Montgomery]] and his peers. The City of San Jose has established Montgomery Park, a Monument at San Felipe and Yerba Buena Roads, and John J. Montgomery Elementary School in his honor. During this period, San Jose also became a center of innovation for the mechanization and industrialization of agricultural and food processing equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jbtcorporation.com/en/Our-Company/Our%20Legacy |title=Our Legacy – JBT |publisher=Jbtcorporation.com |access-date=May 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605072924/http://www.jbtcorporation.com/en/Our-Company/Our%20Legacy |archive-date=June 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Though not affected as severely as San Francisco, San Jose also suffered significant damage from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].

During the 1950s and 1960s, City Manager [[A. P. Hamann|A. P. "Dutch" Hamann]] led the city in a major growth campaign. The city annexed adjacent areas, such as [[Alviso, California|Alviso]] and [[Cambrian Park, California|Cambrian Park]], providing large areas for suburbs. An anti-growth reaction to the effects of rapid development emerged in the 1970s, championed by mayors [[Norman Mineta]] and [[Janet Gray Hayes]]. Despite establishing an [[urban growth boundary]], development fees, and the incorporations of [[Campbell, California|Campbell]] and [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], development was not slowed, but rather directed into already-incorporated areas.<ref name=PolHist/>

== Geography ==
[[File:San Jose, California - Map of City Regions & Districts No Color.jpg|left|thumb|Map of San Jose's regions/districts]]
San Jose is located at {{Coord|37|20|10|N|121|53|26|W|type:city_region:US-CA}}. San Jose is located within the [[Santa Clara Valley]], in the southern part of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] in Northern California. The northernmost portion of San Jose touches [[San Francisco Bay]] at [[Alviso, San Jose|Alviso]], though most of the city lies away from the bayshore. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{cvt|180.0|sqmi}}, making the fourth-largest city in California by land area (after Los Angeles, San Diego and [[California City, California|California City]]).<ref name="Census2010"/>

San Jose lies between the [[San Andreas Fault]], the source of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], and the [[Calaveras Fault]]. San Jose is shaken by moderate earthquakes on average one or two times a year. These quakes originate just east of the city on the creeping section of the Calaveras Fault, which is a major source of earthquake activity in Northern California. On April 14, 1984, at 1:15&nbsp;pm local time, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Calaveras Fault near San Jose's Mount Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nature and Tectonic Significance of Fault Zone Weakening |author=R.

Earlier significant quakes rocked the city in 1839, 1851, 1858, 1864, 1865, [[1868 Hayward earthquake|1868]], and 1891. The [[Daly City, California|Daly City]] Earthquake of 1957 caused some damage. The [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] of 1989 also did some damage to parts of the city.

Sales taxes were a chief source of revenue. Hamann would determine where major shopping areas would be, and then annex narrow bands of land along major roadways leading to those locations, pushing "tentacles" or "finger areas" across the Santa Clara Valley and, in turn, walling off the expansion of adjacent communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/entries/dutch_hamann/ |title=Dutch Hamann – Part One |publisher=San Jose Inside |date=January 16, 2006 |access-date=July 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110022621/http://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/entries/dutch_hamann/ |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Arbuckle|1986|p=62}}<ref>{{cite news|title=S.J., Cupertino Border Realignment Studied|work=San Jose Mercury|location=San Jose, California|date=August 6, 1974|page=11|via=NewsBank}}</ref>

During his reign, it was said the City Council would vote according to Hamann's nod. In 1963, the State of California imposed [[Local Agency Formation Commission]]s statewide, but largely to try to maintain order with San Jose's aggressive growth. Eventually the political forces against growth grew as local neighborhoods bonded together to elect their own candidates, ending Hamann's influence and leading to his resignation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/entries/dutch_hamann1/ |title=Dutch Hamann – Part Two |date=January 16, 2006 |publisher=San Jose Inside |access-date=July 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110022715/http://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/entries/dutch_hamann1/ |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the job was not complete, the trend was set.

Major thoroughfares in the city include [[Monterey Road]], the [[Stevens Creek Boulevard]]/[[San Carlos Street]] corridor, [[Santa Clara Street]]/[[Alum Rock Avenue]] corridor, [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], and [[1st Street (San Jose)]].

=== Climate ===
San Jose, like most of the Bay Area, has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''[[Warm-summer Mediterranean|Csb]]''),<ref name="Nature">{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature|access-date=April 26, 2024 |archive-date=January 5, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240105151210/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mtr/sfd_sjc_climate/sjc/SJC_CLIMATE3.php |title=Climate of San Jose |author=Miguel Miller |access-date=June 18, 2007 |publisher=National Weather Service |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215213648/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mtr/sfd_sjc_climate/sjc/SJC_CLIMATE3.php |archive-date=December 15, 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with warm to hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. San Jose has an average of 298 days of sunshine and an annual mean temperature of {{cvt|61.4|°F|1}}. It lies inland, surrounded on three sides by mountains, and does not front the Pacific Ocean like San Francisco. As a result, the city is somewhat more sheltered from rain, barely avoiding a [[Cold semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid]] (''BSk'') climate.<ref name="Nature" />

Like most of the Bay Area, San Jose is made up of dozens of [[microclimate]]s. Because of a more prominent [[rain shadow]] from the Santa Cruz Mountains, Downtown San Jose experiences the lightest rainfall in the city, while South San Jose, only {{cvt|10|mi}} distant, experiences more rainfall, and somewhat more extreme temperatures.

The monthly daily average temperature ranges from around {{cvt|50|°F}} in December and January to around {{cvt|70|°F|0}} in July and August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accuweather.com/us/ca/san-jose/95113/forecast-month.asp |title=San Jose Month Weather |publisher=AccuWeather |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117201046/http://www.accuweather.com/us/ca/san-jose/95113/forecast-month.asp |archive-date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> The highest temperature ever recorded in San Jose was {{cvt|109|°F|C}} on September 6, 2022; the lowest was {{cvt|18|°F|1}} on January 6, 1894. On average, there are 2.7 mornings annually where the temperature drops to, or below, the freezing mark; and sixteen afternoons where the high reaches or exceeds {{cvt|90|°F|1|disp=or}}. [[Diurnal temperature variation]] is far wider than along the coast or in San Francisco but still a shadow of what is seen in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].

"Rain year" precipitation has ranged from {{cvt|4.83|in|mm|1}} between July 1876 and June 1877 to {{cvt|30.30|in|mm|1}} between July 1889 and June 1890, although at the current site since 1893 the range is from {{cvt|5.33|in|mm|1}} in "rain year" 2020–21 to {{cvt|30.25|in|mm|1}} in "rain year" 1982–83. 2020-2021 was the lowest precipitation year ever, in 127 years of precipitation records in San Jose. The most precipitation in one month was {{cvt|12.38|in|mm|1}} in January 1911. The maximum 24-hour rainfall was {{cvt|3.60|in|1}} on January 30, 1968. On August 16, 2020, one of the most widespread and strong thunderstorm events in recent Bay Area history occurred as an unstable humid air mass moved up from the south and triggered multiple dry thunderstorms<ref>{{cite web|url=https://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=dry+thunderstorm|title=Glossary – NOAA's National Weather Service|first=NOAA's National Weather|last=Service|website=w1.weather.gov|access-date=July 3, 2021|archive-date=July 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709182609/https://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=dry+thunderstorm|url-status=live}}</ref> which caused many fires to be ignited by 300+ lightning strikes in the surrounding hills. The CZU lightning complex fires took almost 5 months to fully be controlled.

The snow level drops as low as {{cvt|4000|ft|-1}} above sea level, or lower, occasionally coating nearby [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] and, less frequently, the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], with snow that normally lasts a few days. Snow will snarl traffic traveling on [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]] towards [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. Snow rarely falls in San Jose; the most recent snow to remain on the ground was on February 5, 1976, when many residents around the city saw as much as {{cvt|3|in|m}} on car and roof tops. The official observation station measured only {{cvt|0.5|in|m}} of snow.<ref>{{cite web

===Neighborhoods and districts===
{{main|Category:Neighborhoods in San Jose, California}}

The city is generally divided into the following areas: Central San Jose (centered on [[Downtown San Jose]]), [[West San Jose]], [[North San Jose]], [[East San Jose]], and [[South San Jose]]. Many of San Jose's districts and neighborhoods were previously [[unincorporated area|unincorporated communities]] or separate municipalities that were later annexed by the city.

The large concentration of high-technology engineering, computer, and microprocessor companies around San Jose has led the area to be known as Silicon Valley. Area schools such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[San Jose State University]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[California State University, East Bay]], [[Santa Clara University]], and [[Stanford University]] pump thousands of engineering and computer science graduates into the local economy every year.

High economic growth during the [[Dot-com bubble|tech bubble]] caused employment, housing prices, and traffic congestion to peak in the late 1990s.

Because the downtown area is in the flight path to nearby [[Mineta San Jose International Airport]] (also evidenced in the above panoramic), there is a height limit for buildings in the downtown area, which is underneath the final approach corridor to the airport. The height limit is dictated by local ordinances, driven by the distance from the runway and a slope defined by Federal Aviation Administration regulations. Core downtown buildings are limited to approximately {{cvt|300|ft|m}} but can get taller farther from the airport.<ref>{{cite web |title=Staff Review Agenda |url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/planning/pdf/recent/111507.pdf |publisher=City of San Jose |date=November 15, 2007 |access-date=May 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528012158/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/planning/pdf/recent/111507.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Happy Birthday San Jose (24637282368).jpg|thumb|left|Celebrations for the 240th anniversary of the founding of San Jose at the [[Peralta Adobe]] in 2017.]]
Public art is an evolving attraction in the city. The city was one of the first to adopt a public art ordinance at 2% of capital improvement building project budgets,<ref>{{cite web |title=2006–2007 Proposed Capital Budget |url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/budget/FY0607/ProposedCapital/28.pdf |website=City of San Jose |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822225404/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/budget/FY0607/ProposedCapital/28.pdf |archive-date=August 22, 2006}}</ref> and as a result of this commitment, a considerable number of public art projects exist in the downtown area, and a growing collection in neighborhoods including libraries, parks, and fire stations. In particular, the Mineta Airport expansion incorporated art and technology into its development.
Early public art included a statue of [[Quetzalcoatl]] (the plumed serpent) downtown, controversial in its planning because some called it pagan, and controversial in its implementation because many felt that the final statue by [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] did not look like a winged serpent, and was more noted for its expense than its aesthetics. Locals joked that the statue resembles a pile of [[feces]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Herhold: I'll miss the red eyes of San Jose's plumed serpent |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/scott-herhold/ci_17274049?nclick_check=1 |work=San Jose Mercury News |date=February 2, 2011 |first=Scott |last=Herhold |access-date=April 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125225457/http://www.mercurynews.com/scott-herhold/ci_17274049?nclick_check=1 |archive-date=January 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A statue of [[Thomas Fallon]] also met strong resistance from those who called him largely responsible for the decimation of early native populations. [[Chicano]]/Latino activists protested because he had captured San Jose by military force in the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846). They also protested the perceived "repression" of historic documents detailing Fallon's orders expelling many of the city's [[Californio]] (early Spanish/Mexican/Mestizo) residents. In October 1991 protests at [[Columbus Day]] and [[Dia de la Raza]] celebrations stalled than plan, and the statue was stored in a warehouse in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] for more than a decade. The statue returned in 2002 to a less conspicuous location: Pellier Park, a small triangular patch at the merge of West Julian and West St. James streets.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2002/09/16/daily78.html |title=Fallon statue unveiled |work=Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal |date=September 20, 2002 |access-date=June 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314193405/http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2002/09/16/daily78.html |archive-date=March 14, 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2001, the city-sponsored SharkByte, an exhibit of decorated [[shark]]s based on the mascot of the hockey team, the San Jose Sharks, and modeled after Chicago's display of decorated cows.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jim LaFrenere |url=http://www.chicagotraveler.com/cows_on_parade.htm |title=Chicago cows on parade exhibit |publisher=Chicagotraveler.com |access-date=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112447/http://chicagotraveler.com/cows_on_parade.htm |archive-date=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> Large models of sharks decorated in clever, colorful, or creative ways by local artists were displayed for months at dozens of locations around the city. After the exhibition, the sharks were auctioned off for charity.

In 2006, [[Adobe Systems]] commissioned an art installation titled ''San Jose Semaphore'' by Ben Rubin,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C&pg=PA342 |title=Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance |author=Chris Salter |first2=Peter |last2=Sellars |year=2010 |page=342 |isbn=978-0-262-19588-1 |publisher=The MIT Press |access-date=November 20, 2020 |archive-date=April 23, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230423094456/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C&pg=PA342 |url-status=live }} --via Google Books.</ref> at the top of its headquarters building.

San Jose retains a number of murals in the Chicano history tradition of [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]] of murals as public textbooks.<ref name=SJMN>{{cite news| title=San Jose's Disappearing Murals: 'It's Like Wiping Away People's History' |author=Leonardo Castaneda |publisher=Bay Area News Group |work=San Jose Mercury-News| page=A1 |date=December 16, 2018 }}</ref>

Although intended to be permanent monuments to the city's heritage as a mission town founded in 1777, a number of murals have been painted over, notably ''Mural de la Raza'', on the side of a Story Rd shoe store, and ''Mexicatlan'' at the corner of Sunset and Alum Rock. In addition, two of three murals by Mexican artist Gustavo Bernal Navarro have disappeared.<ref name=SJMN /> The third mural, ''La Medicina y la Comunidad'' at the Gardner clinic on East Virginia Street, depicts both modern and traditional healers.<ref name=SJMN />

Surviving Chicano history murals include ''Nuestra Senora de Guadelupe'' at Our Lady of Guadalupe church and the 1970s or 1980s ''Virgen de Guadelupe Huelga Bird'' at Cal Foods east of downtown. The Guadalajara restaurant has the 1986 ''Guadalajara Market No. 2'' by Edward Earl Tarver III and a 2013 work by Jesus Rodriguez and Empire 7, ''La Gran Culture Resonance''.<ref name=SJMN />

An unknown artist painted the ''Huelga Bird and Aztec City'' mural in the 1970s or 1980s on the Clyde L. Fisher Middle School. In 1995 Antonio Nava Torres painted ''The Aztec Calendar Handball Court'' at Biebrach Park, and the unknown artist of ''Chaco's Pachuco'' painted it on the former Chaco's Restaurant in the 1990s. The ''Jerry Hernandez'' mural by Frank Torres at Pop's Mini Mart on King Road dates to 2009, and another recent mural by Carlos Rodriguez on the Sidhu Market at Locust and West Virginia depicts a stern-looking warrior.<ref name=SJMN />

=== Local ===
San Jose is a [[charter city]] under California law, giving it the power to enact local ordinances that may conflict with state law, within the limits provided by the charter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ceres.ca.gov/planning/bol/1999/charter.html |title=List of California Charter Cities |work=The California Planners' Book of Lists |year=1999 |access-date=June 9, 2007 |publisher=California Governor's Office of Planning and Research |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208132759/http://ceres.ca.gov/planning/bol/1999/charter.html |archive-date=February 8, 2007}}</ref> The city has a [[council-manager government]] with a [[city manager]] nominated by the mayor and elected by the [[city council]].

The [[San Jose City Council]] is made up of ten council members elected by district, and a mayor elected by the entire city. During city council meetings, the mayor presides, and all eleven members can vote on any issue. The mayor has no veto powers. Council members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms; the even-numbered district council members beginning in 1994; the mayor and the odd-numbered district council members beginning in 1996.<ref name=Charter>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/clerk/Charter.htm |title=San Jose City Charter |publisher=Sanjoseca.gov |access-date=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112063906/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/clerk/Charter.htm |archive-date=January 12, 2010}}</ref> Each council member represents approximately 100,000 constituents.

Council members and the mayor are limited to two successive terms in office, although a council member that has reached the term limit can be elected mayor, and vice versa. The council elects a vice-mayor from the members of the council at the second meeting of the year following a council election. This council member acts as mayor during the temporary absence of the mayor, but does not succeed to the mayor's office upon a vacancy.<ref name="Charter"/>
[[File:Matt Mahan Web Summit 2015 3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Matt Mahan]] is the current [[Mayor of San Jose, California|Mayor of San Jose]].]]
The City Manager is the chief administrative officer of the city, and must present an annual [[budget]] for approval by the city council. When the office is vacant, the Mayor proposes a candidate for City Manager, subject to council approval. The council appoints the Manager for an indefinite term, and may at any time remove the manager, or the electorate may remove the manager through a [[recall election]].

The Santa Clara County LAFCO has set boundaries of San Jose's "Sphere of Influence" (indicated by the blue line in the map near the top of the page) as a superset of the actual city limits (the yellow area in the map), plus parts of the surrounding unincorporated county land, where San Jose can, for example, prevent development of fringe areas to concentrate city growth closer to the city's core. The LAFCO also defines a subset of the Sphere as an 'Urban Service Area' (indicated by the red line in the map), effectively limiting development to areas where urban infrastructure (sewers, electrical service, etc.) already exists.

=== Libraries ===
{{main|San José Public Library}}
[[File:2008-0817-SJSU-MLKlib.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library]] is the single largest library building in the [[Western United States]].]]
The [[San José Public Library]] system is unique in that the [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library]] combines the collections of the city's system with the San Jose State University main library. In 2003, construction of the library, which now holds more than 1.6&nbsp;million items, was the largest single library construction project west of the Mississippi, with eight floors that result in more than {{cvt|475000|sqft|m2}} of space with a capacity for 2&nbsp;million volumes.<ref>[http://www.sjlibrary.org/history-king-library SJ Library MLK History of the King Library] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929185904/http://www.sjlibrary.org/history-king-library |date=September 29, 2013 }} (Mentions joint university/city status, collection size and size of construction project.)</ref>

The city has 23 neighborhood branches including the ''Biblioteca Latinoamericana'' ('Latin American Library') which specializes in Spanish language works.<ref>[http://www.sjpl.org/locations Locations page at SJ Library site] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928075739/http://www.sjpl.org/locations |date=September 28, 2013 }} (See BL article for its references.)</ref> The [[East San Jose Carnegie Branch Library]], a [[Carnegie library]] opened in 1908, is the last Carnegie library in Santa Clara County still operating as a public library and is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. As the result of a bond measure passed in November 2000, a number of brand new or completely reconstructed branches have been completed and opened. The yet-to-be-named brand new Southeast Branch is also planned, bringing the bond library project to its completion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjlibrary.org/about/sjpl/bond/index.htm |title=Bond Projects for Branch Libraries page at the SJ Library site |publisher=Sjlibrary.org |access-date=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613044713/http://sjlibrary.org/about/sjpl/bond/index.htm |archive-date=June 13, 2010 }}</ref>

The San Jose system (along with the university system) were jointly named as "Library of the Year" by ''[[Library Journal]]'' in 2004.<ref>[http://www.sanjoseca.gov/cityManager/pdf/AnnualReport03-04.pdf San Jose 2003–2004 Annual Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145814/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/cityManager/pdf/AnnualReport03-04.pdf |date=May 14, 2012 }} "In 2004, San José Public Library and San José State University Library were jointly named Library of the Year by the Library Journal."</ref>

== Transportation ==
Like other American cities built mostly after World War II, San Jose is highly automobile-dependent, with 76 percent of residents driving alone to work and 12 percent carpooling in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/ |title=Table S0801.

[[File:Diridon Station San Jose.JPG|thumb|left|[[San Jose Diridon station|Diridon Station]] will be the largest multi-modal transportation hub in the [[Western United States]] with the arrival of [[California High-Speed Rail]] and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]].]]
Rail service to and from San Jose is provided by [[Amtrak]] (the Sacramento–San-Jose [[Capitol Corridor]] and the [[Seattle]]–Los-Angeles [[Coast Starlight]]), [[Caltrain]] (commuter rail service between San Francisco and [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]]), [[Altamont Corridor Express|ACE]] (commuter rail service to [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]] and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]]), and the local [[VTA light rail]] system connecting downtown to [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], and [[Almaden Valley, San Jose, California|Almaden Valley]], operated by the [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA). Historic [[streetcar]]s from [[History Park at Kelley Park|History Park]] operate on the light rail lines in downtown during holidays.

Long-term plans call for [[BART]] to be expanded to Santa Clara from the [[Berryessa/North San José station]]. Originally, the extension was to be built all at once, but due to the recession, sales tax revenue has dramatically decreased. Because of this, the extension will be built in two phases. Phase 1 extended service to San Jose with the completion of the Milpitas and Berryessa BART stations on June 13, 2020. In addition, San Jose will be a major stop on the future [[California High-Speed Rail]] route between Los Angeles and San Francisco.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Goll |title=BART-San Jose planners in it for the long haul |url=http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/03/16/story4.html |newspaper=San Jose Business Journal |date=March 13, 2009 |access-date=March 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114080843/http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/03/16/story4.html |archive-date=November 14, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[San Jose Diridon station|Diridon Station]] (formerly Cahill Depot, 65 Cahill Street) is the meeting point of all regional commuter rail service in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abc7news.com/5254419/ |title=Central Valley high-speed rail may help solve Bay Area housing, job crisis |last1=Miguel |first1=Ken |last2=Lim |first2=Dion |date=April 23, 2019 |website=ABC7 San Francisco|access-date=April 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423120942/https://abc7news.com/5254419/ |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was built in 1935 by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], and was refurbished in 1994.

[[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] also operates many bus routes in San Jose and the surrounding communities, as well as offering [[paratransit]] services to local residents.

San Jose is served by [[San Jose International Airport|Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport]] {{cvt|2|mi|km|spell=in}} northwest of downtown, and by [[Reid-Hillview Airport|Reid-Hillview Airport of Santa Clara County]], [[general aviation]] airport located in the eastern part of San Jose. San Jose residents also use [[San Francisco International Airport]], a major international hub located {{cvt|35|mi|km}} to the northwest, and [[San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport]], another major international airport located {{cvt|35|mi|km}} to the north. The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]], [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]], and [[California State Route 87|SR 87]].

=== Highways ===
The San Jose area is served by a freeway system that includes three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate freeways]] and one [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Route]]. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a [[List of Interstate Highways|primary (one- or two-digit route number) Interstate]]; most of the Interstate Highway Network [[Interstate Highway System#Planning|was planned]] by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later.

[[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] runs south to the [[Central Coast (California)|California Central Coast]] and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] to San Francisco. [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of the San Francisco Peninsula. [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] heads north to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]] parallels I-880 to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].
[[File:HTC Columbia (5584076774).jpg|thumb|right|The 2010 [[Amgen Tour of California|Amgen ''Tour of California'']] outside the [[Fairmont San Jose]].]]
Several state highways also serve San Jose: [[California State Route 17|SR 17]], [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], [[California State Route 87|SR 87]] and [[California State Route 237|SR 237]]. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the [[California county routes in zone G#G8|Almaden Expressway]], [[California county routes in zone G#G21|Capitol Expressway]], [[California county routes in zone G#G4|San Tomas Expressway]], and [[California county routes in zone G#G2|Lawrence Expressway]].

Several regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to manage congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expanding [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] to add more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.

The interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101 was named the [[Joe Colla Interchange]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |title=Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 102 – Joe Colla Interchange |publisher=California State Legislature |date=August 30, 2010 |access-date=November 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110181018/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>
