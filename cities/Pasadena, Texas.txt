==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Pasadena, Texas|History of the Galveston Bay Area}}

===Early history===
Prior to European settlement the area around Galveston Bay was settled by the [[Karankawa]] and [[Atakapan]] tribes, particularly the [[Akokisa]], who lived throughout the [[Gulf coast]] region. [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] explorers such as the Rivas-Iriarte expedition and José Antonio de Evia charted the bay and gave it its name.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=uzeuj | name=Exploration | author=Morris, John Miller | retrieved=November 14, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.<br />{{Handbook of Texas | name=Galveston County | id=hcg02 | author=Kleiner, Diana J. | retrieved=November 14, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref> The [[pirate]] [[Jean Lafitte]] established a short-lived kingdom based in Galveston in the early 19th century with bases and hide-outs around the bay and around [[Clear Lake (Galveston Bay)|Clear Lake]].<ref>*{{Cite book | title= Newcomer's Handbook Neighborhood Guide: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin| author=Chang, Yushan | publisher=First Books | year=2006 | location=Portland, OR | pages=180–192 [187] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=131SQLhqScMC | isbn= 0-912301-70-8}}<br />{{cite book | title=A Marmac Guide to Houston and Galveston | author=Kearney, Syd | year=2005 | publisher=Pelican Publishing Company | location=Gretna, LA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnCSsWgUwTkC | isbn= 1-58980-322-1 | page=177}}</ref> Lafitte was forced to leave in 1821 by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | name=Lafitte, Jean | id=fla12 | author=Warren, Harris Gaylord | retrieved=November 7, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref>

Following its [[declaration of independence]] from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] the new nation of [[Mexico]] moved to colonize its northern territory of Texas by offering [[land grant]]s to settlers both from within Mexico and from the nearby United States. The colony established by Stephen F. Austin and the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company of New York rapidly began a wave of settlement around the bay.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=fau14 | name=Austin, Stephen Fuller | author=Barker, Eugene C. | retrieved=November 14, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref><ref name="HOT: GBTLC">{{Handbook of Texas | id=ufg01 | name=Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company | author=Reichstein, Andreas | retrieved=November 15, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref><ref>Barker (1969), pp. 277–278.</ref> Following a coup in the Mexican government by General [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]], Texas revolted against Mexican rule in 1835.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=qdt01 | name=Texas Revolution | author=Barker, Eugene C.; Pohl, James W. | retrieved=November 15, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref> After several battles and skirmishes the final [[Battle of San Jacinto|battle]] of the [[Texas Revolution]] took place near modern Pasadena on April 21, 1836. While the main battlefield was located in the neighboring present-day city of [[La Porte, Texas|La Porte]], Santa Anna was captured in present-day Pasadena at [[Vince Bayou|Vince's Bayou]]. Because this was the last conflict that led to the Mexican surrender, Pasadena and neighboring [[Deer Park, Texas|Deer Park]] have adopted the nickname "Birthplace of [[Texas]]".<ref>[[Washington County, Texas]] shares the claim to that title, since that is where the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] was signed.  [[Brazoria County, Texas]] claims to be "Where Texas Began", as its city of [[Velasco, Texas]] was where the [[Treaties of Velasco]] were signed, and where [[Stephen F. Austin]] originally settled.{{cite web |url=http://www.brazoria-county.com/ |title=Brazoria County Home |publisher=Brazoria County, Texas |access-date=2009-06-12}}</ref>

===Ranching and settlement===
Sam Allen started a ranch in 1843 with {{convert|350|acre|km2}}.
This became the [[Allen Ranch]] which occupied what is now western Pasadena all the way to [[Harrisburg, Texas]]. By 1888, the ranch contained {{convert|15000|acre|km2}} in Harris County, {{convert|10000|acre|km2}} in [[Brazoria County, Texas]] with grazing lands in [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston]] and [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend]] Counties.

The [[Galveston, Houston & Henderson Railroad]] ran through the Allen ranch. There was a problem of cattle being regularly killed on the tracks and in 1875, Allen built a {{convert|19|mi|km|adj=on}} fence along the east side of the railway right of way to keep the cattle off the tracks. The fence ran from [[Harrisburg, Houston, Texas|Harrisburg]] to [[League City, Texas|League City]] and had four rails and a top rail wide enough to walk on. A gate was placed in the fence at the Harrisburg-[[Lynchburg, Texas|Lynchburg]] Road with a large sign above instructing that it should be closed at all times. The area east of this railroad fence running from [[Buffalo Bayou]] to the tracks on [[Sims Bayou]] ran all the way to [[Galveston Bay]]. It contained {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} of grazing land for cattle.

"Proposed" towns in or near present-day Pasadena were set up but short lived and either abandoned or never even got off the ground.
In 1892 Colonel John H. Burnett of Galveston established an unnamed townsite on the Vince Survey just east of the Allen Ranch. Burnett was involved in both construction and promotion of railroads and knew their impact on the value of property. The land was sold in {{convert|10|acre}} lots. He had also established the nearby towns of Deepwater and [[Genoa, Houston, Texas|Genoa]], later to be incorporated into Pasadena and Houston.

Pasadena voted to incorporate in 1923, but residents decided to cancel the incorporation one year later. Pasadena incorporated in 1928.

Gilley resided in Pasadena until his death May 7, 2022. The old address of Gilley's is a used-car lot.<ref name=pasadenavotingcase>"City emerges as new voting rights battleground", ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', January 4, 2015, p. 4A</ref>

At its height, the city's strawberry growers shipped as many as 28 train carloads of strawberries each day. To honor that history, the city still holds an annual Pasadena Strawberry Festival. Strawberry Road stretches through much of the city near where the old strawberry crops grew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strawberryfest.org/|title=Welcome to the Pasadena Strawberry Festival home of the world largest strawberry shortcake|website=Pasadena Strawberry Festival|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref> Attendance at the annual Strawberry Festival was 56,000 in 2008.
