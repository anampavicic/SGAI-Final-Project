* [[Latin]]: ''Thorunium'', ''Thorunia''}} is a city on the [[Vistula]] River in north-central [[Poland]] and a [[World Heritage Sites of Poland|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Its population was 196,935 as of December 2021.<ref name="population" /> Previously, it was the capital of the [[Toruń Voivodeship]] (1975–1998) and the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]] (1921–1945). Since 1999, Toruń has been a seat of the local government of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]] and is one of its two capitals, together with [[Bydgoszcz]]. The cities and neighboring counties form the [[Bydgoszcz–Toruń]] twin city metropolitan area.

Toruń is one of the oldest cities in Poland; it was first settled in the 8th century and in 1233 was expanded by the [[Teutonic Knights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torun.pl/en/kultura/history-torun |title=History of Toruń |website=www.torun.pl |access-date=20 August 2017}}</ref> For centuries it was home to people of diverse backgrounds and religions.  From 1264 until 1411, Toruń was part of the [[Hanseatic League]] and by the 17th century a leading trading point, which greatly affected the city's architecture, ranging from [[Brick Gothic]] to [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]].

In the Early Modern period, Toruń was a [[royal city]] of Poland and one of Poland's four largest cities.<ref>Maria Bogucka, ''Miasto i mieszczanin w społeczeństwie Polski nowożytnej XVI-XVIII w.'', Warsaw 2009</ref> With the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, it became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], then of the short-lived [[Duchy of Warsaw]], serving as the temporary Polish capital in 1809,<ref name=inh/> then again of Prussia, of the [[German Empire]] and, after [[World War I]], of the reborn [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]]. During the [[Second World War]], Toruń was spared bombing and destruction; its Old Town and iconic central marketplace have been entirely preserved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visittorun.pl/|title=VisitTorun: Torun Guide - Home|first=JW Web|last=Development|access-date=7 April 2017}}</ref>

Toruń is renowned for its [[Toruń gingerbread|gingerbread]] – the gingerbread-baking tradition dates back nearly a [[millennium]] – as well as for its large [[Toruń Cathedral|Cathedral]]. Toruń is noted for its very high [[standard of living]] and quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://urbnews.pl/jakosc-zycia-w-polskich-miastach-ranking/|title=Jakość życia w polskich miastach - ranking - Urbnews.pl|date=2 December 2015|access-date=7 April 2017}}</ref> In 1997 the medieval part of the city was designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Sites of Poland|World Heritage Site]]. In 2007 the Old Town of Toruń was added to the list of [[Seven Wonders of Poland]].

{{Further|History of Toruń}}

=== Middle Ages ===
The first settlement in the vicinity of Toruń is dated by [[archaeologists]] to 1100 BC ([[Lusatian culture]]).<ref>[http://www.dziejba.org/strony/english/summary.htm Hypothetical reconstruction of a Lusatian culture settlement, built using bronze age tools: Wola Radziszowska, Poland], part of a study by scientists from the [[Jagiellonian University]]'s Institute of Archaeology.</ref> During early medieval times, in the 7th through 13th centuries, it was the location of an old [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] settlement,<ref name="PWN">Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN Warsaw 1976</ref> at a ford of the [[Vistula]]. In the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]].
[[File:Torun Ratusz Staromiejski 2010 03 04 7189.JPG|thumb|left|The Gothic Old Town Hall (''Ratusz Staromiejski'') dates back to the 13th century]]

In spring 1231 the [[Teutonic Knights]] crossed the river Vistula near [[Nieszawa]] and established a fortress. On 28 December 1233, the Teutonic Knights [[Hermann von Salza]] and [[Hermann Balk]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111019152838/http://torun.pl/portal/index.php?strona=zw_krzy "Krzyżacy - założyciele Torunia" (Teutonic Knights&nbsp;— the founders of Thorn).] (Internet Archive) Urząd Miasta Torunia. "The foundation charter for Thorn was signed on 28 December 1233 by the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order Hermann von Salza and the National Master for Prussia and the Slavonic Lands Hermann Balka. In that way Thorn was founded by the Teutonic Order and managed by the Knights until 1454." Retrieved 16 June 2013.</ref> signed the city charters for Toruń (''Thorn'') and [[Chełmno]] (''Kulm''). The original document was lost in 1244. The set of rights in general is known as [[Kulm law]]. In 1236, due to frequent flooding,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/historischcompa00tpgoog/page/n186 <!-- pg=167 quote=28 December 1233 Salza. --> Max Töppen ''Historisch-comparative Geographie von Preussen: Nach den Quellen, namentlich auch archivalischen''], J. Perthes, 1858;  [https://archive.org/details/historischcompa00tpgoog PDF]</ref> it was relocated to the present site of the Old Town. In 1239 [[Franciscan]] friars settled in the city, followed in 1263 by [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. In 1264 the adjacent New Town was founded, predominantly to house Torun's growing population of craftsmen and artisans, who predominantly came from German-speaking lands.<ref>{{cite book|title=God's Playground A History of Poland Volume 1: The Origins to 1795|author=Norman Davies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|pages=65}}</ref>
In 1280, the city (or as it was then, both cities) joined the mercantile [[Hanseatic League]], and thus became an important medieval trade centre.

In the 14th century, papal verdicts ordered the restoration of the area to Poland, however, the Teutonic Knights did not comply and continued to occupy the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/wojny-polsko-krzyzackie;3997560.html|title=wojny polsko-krzyżackie|website=Encyklopedia PWN|access-date=23 January 2024|language=pl}}</ref> The city was recaptured by Poland in 1410 during the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War]] however, after the [[Peace of Thorn (1411)|First Peace of Thorn]] was signed in the city in February 1411, the city fell back to the Teutonic Order. In 1411, the city left the Hanseatic League. In the 1420s, Polish King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] built the [[Dybów Castle]], located in present-day left-bank Toruń, which he visited numerous times.<ref name=lgk>{{cite journal|last=Grzeszkiewicz-Kotlewska|first=Lidia|year=2002|title=Zamek Władysława Jagiełły w Dybowie w świetle badań archeologicznych w latach 1998-2001|journal=Rocznik Toruński|publisher=Wydawnictwo Naukowe [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń|Uniwersytetu Mikołaja Kopernika]]|language=pl|volume=29|page=19}}</ref> During the next big [[Polish–Teutonic War (1431–1435)|Polish–Teutonic War]], Dybów Castle was occupied by the Teutonic Knights from 1431 to 1435.<ref name=lgk/>

In 1440, the gentry of Toruń co-founded the [[Prussian Confederation]] to further oppose the Knights' policies. From 1452, talks between Polish King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] and the burghers of the Confederation were held at Dybów Castle.<ref name=lgk/> The Confederation rose against the [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]] in 1454 and its delegation submitted a petition to Polish King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] asking him to regain power over the region as its rightful ruler. An act of incorporation was signed in [[Kraków]] 6 March 1454, recognizing the region (including Toruń), as part<ref>F. Kiryk, J. Ryś, Wielka Historia polski, t. II, 1320–1506, Kraków 1997, pp. 160–161.</ref> of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish Kingdom]]. These events led to the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]]. The citizens of the city, enraged by the Order's ruthless exploitation, conquered the Teutonic castle, and dismantled the fortifications brick by brick, except for the Gdanisko tower which was used until the 18th century to store gunpowder.<ref name="torun.pl">{{cite web |title=Ruiny Zamku Krzyżackiego |trans-title=Remnants of the Teutonic Castle |publisher=Urząd Miasta Torunia |year=2017 |work=Toruńskie Serwisy Miejskie |url=http://www.torun.pl/pl/turystyka/zabytki/zamki/ruiny-zamku-krzyzackiego |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="torun.pl2">{{cite web |title=Krzyżacy - założyciele Torunia |trans-title=Teutonic Knights – the founders of town |work=Gotyk na dotyk |author=Urząd Miasta Torunia |year=2012 |url=http://www.torun.pl/portal/index.php?strona=zw_krzy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119144339/http://www.torun.pl/portal/index.php?strona=zw_krzy |archive-date=19 January 2012 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> The local mayor pledged allegiance to the Polish king during the incorporation in March 1454 in Kraków,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Górski|first=Karol|title=Związek Pruski i poddanie się Prus Polsce: zbiór tekstów źródłowych|year=1949|publisher=Instytut Zachodni|location=[[Poznań]]|language=pl|pages=71–72}}</ref> and then in May 1454, an official ceremony was held in Toruń, in which the nobility, knights, landowners, mayors and local officials from [[Chełmno Land]], including Toruń, again solemnly swore allegiance to the Polish king and the Kingdom of Poland.<ref>Górski, p. 76-77</ref> Since 1454, the city has been authorized by King Casimir IV to mint Polish coins.<ref>Górski, p. 63</ref> During the war, Casimir IV often stayed at the Dybów Castle<ref>Grzeszkiewicz-Kotlewska, p. 19-20</ref> and Toruń financially supported the Polish Army. The New Town and Old Town amalgamated in 1454. The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466, with the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Second Peace of Thorn]], in which the [[Teutonic Order]] renounced any claims to the city and recognised it as part of Poland.<ref>Górski, p. 88</ref> The Polish king granted the town great privileges, similar to those of [[Gdańsk]]. Also in 1454 at [[Dybów Castle]], the King issued the famous [[Statutes of Nieszawa]], covering a set of privileges for the [[szlachta|Polish nobility]]; an event that is regarded as the birth of the noble democracy in Poland, which lasted until the country's [[Partitions of Poland|demise]] in 1795.

=== Early modern period ===
In 1473, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was born, and in 1501 Polish king [[John I Albert]] died in Toruń; his heart was buried in [[Toruń Cathedral|St. John's Cathedral]]. In 1500, the [[Tuba Dei]], the largest [[church bell]] in Poland at the time, was installed at Toruń Cathedral, and a bridge across the Vistula was built, the country's longest wooden bridge at the time. In 1506, Toruń became a [[royal city]] of Poland. In 1528, the royal mint started operating in Toruń. In 1568, a gymnasium was founded, which after 1594 became one of the leading schools of northern Poland for centuries to come.<ref name=LO>{{cite web|url=https://www.1lo.torun.pl/1lo/o-nas/historia-szkoly/|title=Historia szkoły|website=I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu|access-date=4 October 2019|language=pl}}</ref> Also in 1594, the Toruń's first museum (''Musaeum'') was established at the school, beginning the city's museal traditions. A city of great wealth and influence, it enjoyed voting rights during the [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] period.<ref>Polska Encyklopedia Szlachecka, t. I, Warsaw 1935, p. 42.</ref> [[Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Sejms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were held in Toruń in 1576 and 1626.<ref>Władysław Konopczyński, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=2048&dirids=1 ''Chronologia sejmów polskich 1493–1793''].</ref>
[[File:Torun Merian 1641.jpg|thumb|left|Toruń in 1641]]

In 1557, during the [[Protestant Reformation]], the city adopted [[Protestantism]]. Under Mayor [[Henryk Stroband]] (1586–1609), the city became centralized. Administrative power passed into the hands of the city council. In 1595, [[Jesuits]] arrived to promote the [[Counter-Reformation]], taking control of St John's Church. Protestant city officials tried to limit the influx of Catholics into the city, as Catholics (Jesuits and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars) already controlled most of the churches, leaving only St Mary's for Protestant citizens. In 1645, at a time when religious conflicts occurred in many other European countries and the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]] was fought west of Poland, in Toruń, on the initiative of King [[Władysław IV Vasa]], a three-month congress of European Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists was held, known as ''Colloquium Charitativum;'' an important event in the history of interreligious dialogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turystyka.torun.pl/art/231/colloquium-charitativum.html|title=Colloquium Charitativum|website=Toruński Serwis Turystyczny|access-date=4 October 2019|language=pl}}</ref>

During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–21), the city was besieged by Swedish troops. The restoration of [[Augustus II the Strong]] as King of Poland was prepared in the city in the [[Treaty of Thorn (1709)]] by the Russian tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. In the second half of the 17th century, tensions between Catholics and Protestants grew. In the early 18th century about 50 percent of the populace, especially the gentry and middle class, were German-speaking Protestants, while the other 50 percent were Polish-speaking Roman Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsRuj9KMnpIC&pg=PA223

=== Late modern period (from 1793) ===
After the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, the city was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. It was briefly regained by Poles as part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in 1807–1815, even serving as the temporary capital in April and May 1809.<ref name=inh>{{cite web|url=https://nowahistoria.interia.pl/drogi-do-wolnosci/news-torun-stolica-polski-przez-trzy-tygodnie,nId,2946535|title=Toruń stolicą Polski?

After being re-annexed by Prussia in 1815, Toruń was subjected to [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation]] and became a strong center of [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795–1918)|Polish resistance]] against such policies. The city's first synagogue was inaugurated in 1847.<ref name="sztetl.org.pl"/> New Polish institutions were established, such as Towarzystwo Naukowe w Toruniu (''Toruń Scientific Society''), a major Polish institution in the [[Prussian Partition]] of Poland, founded in 1875. After [[World War I]], Poland declared independence and regained control over the city. In [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]], Toruń was the capital of the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]].

During [[World War II]], Germany [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied]] the city from 7 September 1939 to 1 February 1945.

During the occupation, Germany established and operated [[Stalag XX-A]] [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camp]] in the city, with multiple forced labour subcamps in the region, in which Polish, British, [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]], Australian and [[German atrocities committed against Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet]] POWs were held.

While the city's population suffered many atrocities, as described, there were no battles or bombings that damaged its buildings. Thus, the city avoided damage during both World Wars, and retained its historic architecture, ranging from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] through [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] to 19th and 20th century styles.

== Sights ==
Listed on the UNESCO list of [[World Heritage Sites]] since 1997, Toruń has many monuments of architecture dating back to the [[Middle Ages]]. The city is famous for having preserved almost intact its medieval spatial layout and many Gothic buildings, all built from [[brick]], including monumental churches, the Town Hall and many burgher houses.

Toruń has the largest number of [[Gothic architecture in modern Poland|preserved Gothic houses in Poland]], many with Gothic wall paintings or wood-beam ceilings from the 16th to the 18th centuries.

* The [[Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, Toruń|Cathedral of SS. John the Evangelist and John the Baptist]], an aisled hall church built in the 14th century and extended in the 15th century; outstanding Gothic sculptures and paintings inside (Moses, St. Mary Magdalene, gravestone of Johann von Soest), Renaissance and Baroque epitaphs and altars (among them the epitaph of Copernicus from 1580), as well as the [[Tuba Dei]], the largest medieval [[church bell]] in Poland and one of the largest in Europe
* St. Mary's church, a formerly Franciscan aisled hall built in the 14th century
* St. James the Greater's church (often mistakenly called St Jacob's), a basilica from the 14th century, with monumental wall paintings and Gothic stalls
* The [[Old Town City Hall in Toruń|Old Town Hall]] was inaugurated in 1274, than extended and rebuilt between 1391 and 1399, and extended again at the end of the 16th century; considered one of the most monumental town halls in Central Europe ([[Toruń Regional Museum]] or ''Muzeum Okręgowe'' in Polish)
* City fortifications, begun in the 13th century, extended between the 14th and 15th centuries, mostly demolished in the 19th century, but partially preserved with a few city gates and watchtowers (among them the so-called [[Leaning Tower of Toruń|Leaning Tower]]) from the Vistula side. See also: [[Toruń Fortress]]
* A 15th-century Gothic house ([[Toruń Regional Museum|now a museum]]) where Copernicus was reputedly born
* [[Toruń Castle|Ruins of 13th-century Teutonic Knights' castle]]
* House at the sign of the Star ({{langx|pl|Kamienica Pod Gwiazdą}}, the East Asian Museum, previously Gothic, briefly owned by [[Filip Callimachus]], then rebuilt in the 16th century and in 1697, with a richly decorated stucco façade and wooden spiral stairs.

Toruń, unlike many other historic cities in Poland, escaped substantial destruction in World War II. Particularly left intact was the Old Town, all of whose important architectural monuments are originals, not reconstructions.

Major renovation projects have been undertaken in recent years to improve the condition and external presentation of the Old Town. Besides the renovation of various buildings, projects such as the reconstruction of the pavement of the streets and squares (reversing them to their historical appearance), and the introduction of new plants, trees and objects of 'small architecture', are underway.

Numerous buildings and other constructions, including the city walls along the boulevard, are illuminated at night, creating an impressive effect - probably unique among Polish cities with respect to the size of Toruń's Old Town and the scale of the illumination project itself.

Toruń is also home to the [[Zoo and Botanical Garden in Toruń|Zoo and Botanical Garden]] opened in 1965 and 1797 respectively and is one of the city's popular tourist attractions.

== Districts ==
[[File:Torun - czesci2.svg|thumb|Districts of Toruń]]
Toruń is divided into 24 administrative districts (dzielnica) or boroughs, each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government. The Districts include: [[Barbarka, Toruń|Barbarka]], Bielany, Bielawy, Bydgoskie Przedmieście, Chełmińskie Przedmieście, Czerniewice, Glinki, Grębocin nad Strugą, Jakubskie Przedmieście, Kaszczorek, Katarzynka, Koniuchy, Mokre, Na Skarpie, [[Piaski, Toruń|Piaski]], [[Podgórz, Toruń|Podgórz]], Rubinkowo, Rudak, Rybaki, Stare Miasto (''Old Town''), Starotoruńskie Przedmieście, Stawki, Winnica, Wrzosy.

==Symbols==
The colors of Toruń are white and blue in the horizontal arrangement, white top, blue bottom, equal in size. The flag of the city of Toruń is a bipartite sheet. The upper field is white, the lower field is blue. If the flag is hung vertically, the upper edge of the flag must be on the left.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Herb, flaga, hejnał Torunia - Atrakcje Torunia.

The flag with the coat of arms is also in use. The ratio of the height of the coat of arms to the width of the flag is 1:2.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Barwy, flaga, chorągiew {{!}} www.torun.pl|url=https://www.torun.pl/pl/miasto/samorzad/symbole-torunskiego-samorzadu/barwy-flaga-choragiew|website=www.torun.pl|language=pl|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref>

== Climate ==
The climate can be described as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'') if the isotherm of {{Convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}} is used or an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') if the {{Convert|-3|C|F|abbr=on}} isotherm is adopted. Back in 1930s, the city passed close to the original boundary and dividing line of climates C and D groups in the north–south direction proposed by climatologist [[Wladimir Köppen]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=K. |first=Alt, E.

Being close to definitely [[continental climate]]s, it has a high variability caused by the contact of eastern continental air masses and western oceanic ones. This is influenced by the geographical location of the city&nbsp;– the Toruń Basin to the south, and the Vistula Valley to the north.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.powiaty.torun.com.pl:80/torun/pol/srodowisko.htm|title=Środowisko geograficzno-przyrodnicze|publisher=Powiat Toruński|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808034050/http://www.powiaty.torun.com.pl/torun/pol/srodowisko.htm|archive-date=8 August 2010|access-date=8 November 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

Among the demographic trends influencing this decline, are: suburbanisation, migration to larger urban centres, and wider trends observed in the whole of Poland such as general population decline, slowed down by immigration in 2017. The birth rate in the city in 2017 was 0.75. Low birthrates have been consistent in the city for the first two decades of 21st Century.

The official forecasts from [[Statistics Poland]] state that by 2050 the city population will have declined to 157,949.

Inside the city itself, most of the population is concentrated on the right (northern) bank of the Vistula river. Two of the most densely populated areas are Rubinkowo and Na Skarpie, housing projects built mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, located between the central and easternmost districts; their total population is about 70,000.

The [[Bydgoszcz–Toruń]] metro area of Toruń and [[Bydgoszcz]], their counties, and a number of smaller towns, may in total have a population of as much as 800,000. Thus the area contains about one third of the population of the Kuyavia-Pomerania region (which has about 2.1 million inhabitants).{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Transport ==

The transport network in the city has undergone major development in recent years. The partial completion of ring road (East and South), the completion of the second bridge (2013) and various road, and cycling lane improvements, including construction of [[Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa|Trasa Średnicowa]], have decidedly improved the traffic in the city. However, noise barriers that have been erected along the new or refurbished roads have been criticised as not conducive to a beautiful urban landscape. The extensive roadworks have also drawn attention to the declining population numbers, casting doubt that the city might over-delivered for the future number of road users, as the demographic trends forecast from [[Statistics Poland]] predicts a reduction of population by almost 1/4 by year 2050.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.polskawliczbach.pl/Torun | title=Toruń (Kujawsko-pomorskie) » mapy, nieruchomości, GUS, noclegi, szkoły, regon, atrakcje, kody pocztowe, wypadki drogowe, bezrobocie, wynagrodzenie, zarobki, tabele, edukacja, demografia }}</ref>

The city's public transport system comprises [[Trams in Toruń|five tram lines]] and about 40 bus routes, covering the city and some of the neighboring communities.

Toruń is situated at a major road junction, one of the most important in Poland. The [[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]] [[highway]] reaches Toruń, and a southern [[beltway]] surrounds the city. Besides these, the [[European route E75]] and a number of domestic roads (numbered 10, 15, and 80) run through the city.

With three main railway stations ([[Toruń Główny (PKP station)|Toruń Główny]], Toruń Miasto and Toruń Wschodni), the city is a major rail junction, with two important lines crossing there ([[Warsaw]]&ndash;[[Bydgoszcz]] and [[Wrocław]]&ndash;[[Olsztyn]]). Two other lines stem from Toruń, toward [[Malbork]] and [[Sierpc]].
[[File:Dachy zsamolotu4.jpg|thumb|left|Józef Piłsudski Bridge over the [[Vistula river]] - the older of the two road bridges in Toruń]]
The rail connection with [[Bydgoszcz]] is run under a name "BiT City" as a "metropolitan rail". Its main purpose is to allow traveling between and within these cities using one ticket. A joint venture of Toruń, [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Solec Kujawski]] and the voivodeship, it is considered as important in integrating [[Bydgoszcz-Toruń]] metropolitan area. A major modernization of BiT City railroute, as well as a purchase of completely new vehicles to serve the line, is planned for 2008 and 2009. Technically, it will allow to travel between Toruń-East and Bydgoszcz-Airport stations at a speed of {{convert|120|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in a time of approximately half an hour. In a few years' time "BiT City" will be integrated with local transportation systems of Toruń and Bydgoszcz, thus creating a uniform metropolitan transportation network&nbsp;– with all necessary funds having been secured in 2008.

Since September 2008, the "one-ticket" solution has been introduced also as regards a rail connection with [[Włocławek]], as a "regional ticket". The same is planned for connection with [[Grudziądz]].

Two bus depots serve to connect the city with other towns and cities in Poland.

{{As of|2008}}, a [[Toruń Airport|small sport airfield]] exists in Toruń; however, a modernization of the airport is seriously considered with a number of investors interested in it. Independently of this, [[Bydgoszcz Ignacy Jan Paderewski Airport]], located about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=off}} from Toruń city centre, serves the whole [[Bydgoszcz-Toruń]] metropolitan area, with a number of regular flights to European cities.

== Economy ==
[[File:Toruński Park Technologiczny44.jpg|thumb|Toruń's Technology Park]]
Although a medium-sized city, Toruń is the site of the headquarters of some of the largest companies in Poland, or at least of their subsidiaries. The official unemployment rate, {{as of|alt=as of September 2008|2023|01}}, is 5.4%.

In 2006, construction of new plants owned by [[Sharp Corporation]] and other companies of mainly Japanese origin has started in the neighboring community of [[Łysomice]] - about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from city centre. The facilities under construction are located in a newly created special economic zone. As a result of cooperation of the companies mentioned above, a vast high-tech complex is to be constructed in the next few years, providing as many as 10,000 jobs (a prediction for {{update after|2010}}) at the cost of about 450 million euros. {{As of|2008}}, the creation of another special economic zone is being considered, this time inside city limits.
[[File:Torun ul Szeroka.jpg|thumb|Toruń's city centre incorporates a large commercial district]]
Thanks to its architectural heritage Toruń is visited by more than 1.5 million tourists a year (1.6 million in 2007). This makes tourism an important branch of the local economy, although time spent in the city by individual tourists or the number of hotels, which can serve them, are still not considered satisfactory. Major investments in renovation of the city's monuments, building new hotels (including high-standard ones), improvement in promotion, as well as launching new cultural and scientific events and facilities, give very good prospects for Toruń's tourism.
[[File:Małe Garbary Street in Toruń.jpg|left|thumb|Małe Garbary, a typical street in the Old Town of Toruń]]
In recent years Toruń has been a site of intense building construction investments, mainly residential and in its transportation network. The latter has been possible partly due to the use of European Union funds assigned for new member states. Toruń city county generates by far the highest number of new dwellings built each year among all Kuyavian-Pomeranian counties, both relative to its population as well as in absolute values. It has led to almost complete rebuilding of some districts. {{As of|2008}}, many major constructions are either under development or are to be launched soon - the value of some of them exceeding 100 million euros. They include a new speedway stadium, major shopping and entertainment centres, a commercial complex popularly called a "New Centre of Toruń", a music theater, a centre of contemporary art, hotels, office buildings, facilities for the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń|Nicolaus Copernicus University]], roads and tram routes, sewage and fresh water delivery systems, residential projects, the possibility of a new bridge over the Vistula, and more. Construction of the [[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1 motorway]] and th[[Przewozy Regionalne|e BiT City]] fast metropolitan railway also directly affects the city. About 25,000 local firms are registered{{when||date=January 2023}} in Toruń.

== Culture ==
[[File:Teatr im. Wilama Horzycy sm1.jpg|thumb|right|Toruń's main stage, the Wilam Horzyca Theatre]]
Toruń has two drama theatres (''Teatr im. Wilama Horzycy'' with three stages and ''Teatr Wiczy''), two children's theatres (''[[The Baj Pomorski Theater|Baj Pomorski]]'' and ''Zaczarowany Świat''), two music theatres (''Mała Rewia'', ''Studencki Teatr Tańca''), and numerous other theatre groups. The city hosts, among others events, the international theatre festival, "Kontakt", annually in May.

A building called ''Baj Pomorski'' has recently been completely reconstructed. It is now one of the most modern cultural facilities in the city, with its front elevation in the shape of a gigantic chest of drawers. It is located at the south-east edge of the Old Town. Toruń has two cinemas including a [[Cinema City Poland|Cinema City]], which has over 2,000 seats.

Over ten major museums document the history of Toruń and the region. Among others, the "House of Kopernik" and the accompanying museum commemorate [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and his revolutionary work, the university museum reveals the history of the city's academic past.
[[File:Toruń (DerHexer) 2010-07-17 026.jpg|thumb|Toruń [[planetarium]]]]
[[File:PL gingerbread from Torun.jpg|thumb|[[Toruń gingerbread]]]]

The [[Tony Halik]] Travelers' Museum ([[Muzeum Podróżników im. Tony Halika]]) was established in 2003 after [[Elżbieta Dzikowska]] donated to citizens of Toruń a collection of objects from various countries and cultures following the death of her husband, famous explorer and writer, Toruń native, [[Tony Halik]]. It is managed by the [[District Museum in Toruń]].

The Centre of Contemporary Art (''Centrum Sztuki Współczesnej'' - ''CSW'') opened in June 2008 and is one of the most important cultural facilities of this kind in Poland. The modern building is located in the very centre of the city, adjacent to the Old Town. The Toruń Symphonic Orchestra (formerly the Toruń Chamber Orchestra) is well-rooted in the Toruń cultural landscape.

Toruń is home to a [[planetarium]] (located downtown) and an [[Piwnice radio observatory|astronomical observatory]] (located in nearby village of [[Piwnice, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Piwnice]]). The latter boasts the largest [[radio telescope]] in Central Europe with a diameter of {{convert|32|m|2|abbr=on}}, second only to the [[Effelsberg]] {{convert|100|m|2|abbr=on}} radio telescope.

Toruń is well known for [[Toruń gingerbread|gingerbread]], a type of [[pierniki|piernik]] often made in elaborate molds. [[Museum of Toruń Gingerbread]] is a large museum dedicated to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kopernik.com.pl/en/33/dzial_muzeum_torunskiego_piernika.html|title=The Museum of Toruń Gingerbread|access-date=30 April 2015}}</ref> There are also several gingerbread workshops in the town that offer hands-on experiences for tourists, including the popular [[Living Museum of Gingerbread]]. The 15-year-old composer [[Fryderyk Chopin]] was smitten with Toruń gingerbread when he visited his godfather, [[Fryderyk Skarbek]], there in the summer of 1825.

Toruń is a center of conservative Roman Catholic culture.  [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] [[Tadeusz Rydzyk]] has organized here [[Radio Maryja]], [[Telewizja Trwam]], a college whose students contribute to the mentioned media.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Akademia Kultury Społecznej i Medialnej |url=http://wsksim.edu.pl/}}</ref> Now{{when|date=January 2023}} a museum is being constructed.

The [[12999 Toruń]] [[asteroid]] is named after the city.

The existence of a high-ranked and high-profiled university with so many students plays a great role the city's position and importance in general, as well as in creating an image of Toruń's streets and clubs filled with crowds of young people. It also has a serious influence on local economy.

[[File:Torun Skarpa szpital dzieciecy rondo.jpg|right|thumb|Municipal children's hospital]]
Six hospitals of various specializations provide medical service for Toruń itself, its surrounding area and to the region in general. The two largest of these hospitals, recently run by the voivodeship, are to be taken over by Nicolaus Copernicus University and run as its clinical units. At least one of them is to change its status in 2008, with the formal procedures being very advanced.

== International relations ==
Honouring Toruń's sister relationship with [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the Bulwar Filadelfijski (''Philadelphia Boulevard''), a {{convert|2|km|1|abbr=on}} long street running mostly between Vistula River and walls of the Old Town and the boulevard itself, bears its name.
[[File:Tablice miast partnerskich na budynku urzędu miasta.jpg|thumb|upright|Toruń's [[twin cities]]]]
The Ślimak Getyński is one of the lanes connecting Piłsudski Bridge / John Paul II Avenue with Philadelphia Boulevard at their downtown interchange. It honours the relationship with Göttingen, its name derived from the street's half-circular shape (Polish word ''ślimak'' meaning "snail").
