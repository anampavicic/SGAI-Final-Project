'''Klang''' or '''Kelang''', officially '''Royal City of Klang''' ({{langx|ms|Bandaraya Diraja Klang}}), is a city, royal city and former capital of the [[States of Malaysia|state]] of [[Selangor]], Malaysia. It is located within the [[Klang District]]. It was the civil capital of Selangor in an earlier era prior to the emergence of Kuala Lumpur and the current capital, [[Shah Alam]]. [[Port of Port Klang]], which is located in the Klang District, is the 12th busiest transshipment port and the [[List of busiest container ports|12th busiest container port]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=PORT KLANG CELEBRATES OVER 100 YEARS OF BEING MALAYSIA'S PREMIER PORT|url=http://www.pka.gov.my/index.php/en/about-us-/over-100-years.html|publisher=Port Klang Authority|access-date=15 May 2012|archive-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203155/http://www.pka.gov.my/index.php/en/about-us-/over-100-years.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TOP 50 WORLD CONTAINER PORTS|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|publisher=World Shipping Council|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-date=27 August 2013|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130827191609/http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports}}</ref>

As of 2010, the Klang City has a total population of 240,016 (10,445 in the city centre), while the population of Klang District is 842,146, and the population of all towns managed by Klang Municipal Council is 744,062, making it Selangor's second largest city.<ref>{{cite web|last1=MPK |first1=Klang |title=TABURAN PENDUDUK DAN CIRI-CIRI ASAS DEMOGRAFI TAHUN 2010 |url=http://www.mpklang.gov.my/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=b9bbc4fb-2f76-4231-b6ed-58fa36eab0a4&groupId=283929 |website=MP Klang Site  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324063808/http://www.mpklang.gov.my/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=b9bbc4fb-2f76-4231-b6ed-58fa36eab0a4&groupId=283929 |archive-date=24 March 2014 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:British Museum Asia 36.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Klang Bell]], dated 200 BC–200 AD]]

The royal city of Klang has been a site of human settlement since prehistoric times. [[Bronze Age]] drums, axes and other artefacts have been found in the vicinity of the town and within the town itself. A bronze [[Klang Bell|bell]] dating from the 2nd century BC was found in Klang and is now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=247695&partId=1&place=10424&plaA=10424-3-2&page=1 British Museum Collection]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ikSQw_-8gboC&q=%22bronze+age%22+klang+malaysia&pg=PA228 |title=The Kettledrums of Southeast Asia: A Bronze Age World and Its Aftermath – August Johan Bernet Kempers – Google Books |date= 1988-01-01|access-date=17 September 2013|isbn=978-90-6191-541-6 |last1=Bernet Kempers |first1=A.

Klang was under the control of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in the 15th century. The celebrated [[Tun Perak]], the Malacca's greatest [[Bendahara]], came from Klang and became its territorial chief. According to the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', the people of Klang overthrew the local chief or ''[[penghulu]]'' and asked the Sultan of Malacca [[Muzaffar Shah of Malacca|Muzaffar Shah]] to appoint another, and Tun Perak was then appointed the leader. Klang was known as a producer of tin; according to [[Manuel Godinho de Erédia]], it produced one hundred ''[[Bahar (unit)|bares]]'' of tin a year when the Portuguese occupied Malacca.<ref name="winstedt"/>  Klang however remained in Malay hands after the fall of [[Melaka]] to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1511, and was controlled by the [[Sultan of Johor|Sultan of Johor-Riau]]. In the 17th century, the Bugis began to settle in the coastal region of Selangor including Klang, and the [[Sultan of Selangor|Selangor sultanate]] was created in the 1766, which then controlled Klang.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVViEJmN99kC&pg=PA286|title=The A to Z of Malaysia |author= Ooi Keat Gin |page=286 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date= 2010|isbn=978-1-4616-7199-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH6m3mGNJwkC&pg=PA37|title=The Population of Peninsular Malaysia|author= Swee-Hock Saw |page=37 |publisher=Singapore University Press |date=1989|isbn= 978-9971-69-126-4 }}</ref>

In the 19th century the importance of Klang greatly increased by the rapid expansion of [[tin mining]] as a result of the increased demand for tin from the West. The desire to control the Klang Valley led directly to the [[Klang War]] (also called the Selangor Civil War) of 1867–1874 when Raja Mahdi fought to regain what he considered his birthright as territorial chief against Raja Abdullah.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GSBCcNn1fsC&q=%22Raja+Mahdi%22+klang&pg=PA147 |title=A History of Malaysia – Barbara Watson Andaya, Leonard Y.

Klang however did not lose its importance. In 1874, Selangor accepted a British [[Resident (title)|Resident]] who would "advise" the Sultan, and Klang became the capital of British colonial administration for Selangor from 1875 until 1880 when the capital city was moved to Kuala Lumpur due to the growth of Kuala Lumpur from tin-mining.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cImQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |title=Ruling the Margins: Colonial Power and Administrative Rule in the Past and Present |author= Prem Kumar Rajaram |page= 35 |isbn=978-1-317-62107-2 |date=2014-09-19 |publisher=Routledge }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/goldenchersones02birdgoog#page/n308/mode/2up |title=The Golden Chersonese and the Way Thither|author= Isabella Lucy Bird|year= 1883 |pages=271–272 |publisher=G.

Until the construction of Port Swettenham (now known as [[Port Klang]]) in 1901, Klang remained the chief outlet for Selangor's tin, and its position was enhanced by the completion of the Klang Valley railway to Bukit Kuda in 1886, which was then connected to Klang itself via a rail bridge, the Connaught Bridge, completed in 1890.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searail.malayanrailways.com/Selangor/Selangor.htm |title=History of Railways around Kuala Lumpur}}</ref>  In the 1890s its growth was further stimulated by the development of the district into the State' leading producer of coffee, and later rubber.  In 1903, the royal seat was moved back to Klang when it became the official seat of [[Sultan Sulaiman]] (Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Shah).{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In May 1890, a local authority, known as Klang Health Board, was established to administer Klang town. The official boundary of Klang was first defined in 1895.<ref name=council /> The first road bridge over the Klang River connecting the two parts of the town, the Belfield Bridge, was constructed in 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clairegrey.co.uk/rd_grandchildren/george/klang_bri.html |title=The Construction of the Klang Bridge|work=Dearie Russell Family History }}</ref> In 1926 the health boards of Klang and Port Swettenham were merged, and in 1945 the local authority was renamed Klang Town Board.<ref name=council>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpklang.gov.my/en/latar-belakang |title=Background |work=Klang Municipal Council  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518154538/http://www.mpklang.gov.my/en/latar-belakang |archive-date=18 May 2015 }}</ref> In 1954, the Town Board became the Klang Town Council after a [[Local government in Malaysia|local election]] was set up to select its members in accordance with the Local Government Election Ordinance of 1950.

In 1971, the Klang District Council, which incorporated the nearby townships of [[Kapar]] and [[Meru, Malaysia|Meru]] as well as Port Klang, was formed. After undergoing a further reorganisation according to the Local Government Act of 1976 (Act 171), Klang District Council was upgraded to Klang Municipal Council (KMC) on 1 January 1977 and Klang Royal City Council (KRCC) beginning 5 February 2024.<ref name=council /> From 1974 to 1977, Klang was the state capital city of Selangor before the seat of government shifted to Shah Alam in 1977.<ref name="history background">{{cite web |url= http://www.luas.gov.my/icm/icm/knowledge_center/bckground_general.htm |title=Background and History |work=Port Klang Integrated Coastal Management Project }}</ref>

===Etymology===
Klang may have taken its name from the [[Klang River]] which runs through the city. The entire geographical area in the immediate vicinity of the river, which begins at Kuala Lumpur and runs west all the way to [[Port Klang]], is known as the [[Klang Valley]].

One popular theory on the origin of the name is that it is derived from the [[Mon–Khmer]] word ''Klong'',<ref name="sejarah"/> which may mean a canal or waterway.<ref name="sejarah">{{cite web|url=http://www.mpklang.gov.my/en/sejarah |title=History |work=Klang Municipal Council  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518160109/http://www.mpklang.gov.my/en/sejarah |archive-date=18 May 2015 }}</ref> Alternatively it has also been argued that it means "warehouses", from the Malay word ''Kilang'' –  in the old days, it was full of warehouses (''kilang'' currently means "factory").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.nst.com.my/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/the-town-that-tin-built-1.69015 |title=The town that tin built |access-date=2014-07-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031223532/http://www2.nst.com.my/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/the-town-that-tin-built-1.69015 |archive-date=31 October 2014 }}</ref>

Klang was also once known as Pengkalan Batu meaning "stone jetty".<ref name="gullick 1955">{{cite journal |url=http://myrepositori.pnm.gov.my/bitstream/123456789/2265/1/JB1865_MBRA.pdf |title=Kuala Lumpur 1880–1895 |journal = Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume =24 |issue=4 |pages=10–11 |author=JM Gullick |year=1955 }}</ref>

Unlike most other place names in Malaysia, the Chinese name for Klang ({{zh|c=巴生|p=Bāshēng}}), is neither a direct transcription nor translation of the Malay place name, but likely a transcription of another Malay word ''Pasang'', referring to the rising tides around the Klang Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2009-05-16|title=巴生原名Pasang‧肉骨茶香漫皇城|url=https://guangming.com.my/%e5%b7%b4%e7%94%9f%e5%8e%9f%e5%90%8dpasang%e2%80%a7%e8%82%89%e9%aa%a8%e8%8c%b6%e9%a6%99%e6%bc%ab%e7%9a%87%e5%9f%8e|access-date=2021-04-07|website=光明日报|language=zh-TW}}</ref>

Klang is divided into North Klang and South Klang, which are separated by the Klang River. North Klang is divided into three sub-districts which are [[Kapar]] (Located at the north of North Klang), Rantau Panjang (situated at the west of North Klang) and [[Meru, Malaysia|Meru]] (at the east of North Klang).

Klang North used to be the main commercial centre of Klang, but since 2008, more residential and commercial areas as well as government offices are being developed in Klang South.{{cn|date=October 2024}} Most major government and private health care facilities are also located at Klang South. Hence, this area tends to be busier and becomes the centre of social and recreational activities after office hours and during the weekends.{{cn|date=October 2024}} This is triggered by the rapid growth of new and modern townships such as [[Bandar Botanic]], [[Bandar Bukit Tinggi]], Taman Sentosa Perdana, Taman Sri Andalas, Taman Bayu Perdana, Taman Sentosa, [[Glenmarie Cove]], Kota Bayuemas etc. all located within Klang South.

At the Klang North side, some of the older and established residential areas include [[Taman Berkeley|Berkeley Garden]], Taman Eng Ann, Taman Klang Utama, [[Bandar Baru Klang]] and so forth. Newer townships include Bandar Bukit Raja, Aman Perdana and [[Klang Sentral]].

Malaysia's busiest port, [[Port Klang]] was previously named Port Swettenham until 1972 when it was renamed Port Klang. Port Klang is located at Klang South.

== Economy ==
Initially, Bukit Kuda port (located at 12.5 miles away from Klang river mouth) was established as a port that connect to mining areas within Kuala Lumpur. Later, a railway line was built connecting Bukit Kuda with Kuala Lumpur. However, the Bukit Kuda port was found to be unsuitable.{{cn|date=July 2023}} Therefore, the town of Klang which is located at three miles nearer to the river mouth than Bukti Kuda, was chosen to become the major port. A bridge was constructed across the Klang river and railway was connected to Klang in August 1890.{{cn|date=July 2023}} Klang port received huge amount of traffic in the following years, which later the authorities decided to extend the railway line to the mouth of the river where new port named "Port Swettenham" would be constructed in 1901. However, Port Swettenham was plaqued with malaria infections which affected coolies and port staff greatly, causing a delay in unloading cargoes from the ships. Sir Malcom Watson, a district surgeon in Klang solved the malaria problem in 1903 by clearing the forests and undergrowth and construct a drainage system at the same time.<ref name="Kay Kim"/>

Klang gradually became the main manufacturing centre for Malaya after the end of [[World War I]]. The first person who set up a factory in Klang was a millionaire from Singapore named Tan Kah Kee. His factory produced canned pineapples. The setting up of his factory stimulated the pineapple plantations around Klang. After Tan went bankrupt in 1934, Goh Hock Huat, one of the pineapple producers, decided to set up his own pineapple canning factory. More factories opened in Klang due to its proximity to Port Swettenham. In the following years, factories producing rubber products and oil factory producing products from groundnuts were set up with skills and machineries imported from Singapore.<ref name="Kay Kim">{{cite web |last1=Kay Kim |first1=Khoo |title=Klang District and Town: History and Historical Sources |url=http://www.ilhamgallery.com/data/uploads/research/klang-history.pdf |publisher=Ilham Gallery |access-date=16 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221016125027/http://www.ilhamgallery.com/data/uploads/research/klang-history.pdf |archive-date=16 October 2022 |location=Kuala Lumpur}}</ref>
