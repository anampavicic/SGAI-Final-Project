'''Bihar Sharif''' is the headquarters of [[Nalanda district]] and the fifth-largest sub-metropolitan area in the eastern [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Bihar]]. Its name is a combination of two words: ''Bihar'', derived from ''[[vihara]]'' (meaning monastery), also the name of the state; and ''[[Sharif]]'' (meaning ''noble'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of 'sherif' |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sherif |website=Collin's dictionary |access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> The city is a hub of education and trade in southern Bihar, and the economy centers around agriculture supplemented by tourism, the education sector and household manufacturing. The ruins of the ancient [[Nalanda]] Mahavihara, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], are located near the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Archaeological Site of Nalanda Mahavihara at Nalanda, Bihar|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1502/|access-date=2 August 2021|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en}}</ref>

Under the [[Pala Empire]], [[Odantapuri]], a major Buddhist monastic university was built at the site of Bihar Sharif. In the early 14th century, the city was captured by the Delhi Sultanate. Bihar Sharif was later ruled by other Muslim dynasties and then by the British until Indian independence in 1947. The city has important Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim heritage sites and landmarks.

Bihar Sharif is one of the one hundred Indian cities selected to gain funds under Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]]'s flagship [[Smart Cities Mission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/buoyed-by-smart-city-mission-tag-patna-muzaffarpur-gear-up-for-makeover/story-o0pI2BxYUXIGKNBd6lMToO.html|title=Buoyed by smart city mission tag, Patna, Muzaffarpur gear up for makeover|date=26 June 2017|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=30 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{update inline|date=March 2018}} Bihar Sharif was selected in the preliminary list of 100 cities in July 2015 that were to compete for the Smart Cities project.

==Etymology==
The city's name is a combination of two words: ''Bihar'', derived from [[vihara]] (meaning monastery), also the name of the state; and ''Sharif'' (meaning noble), referring to the resting place of the Sufi Saint Sheikh [[Makhdoom Sharfuddin Ahmed Yahya Maneri]].

==History==
===Classical and medieval period===
[[File:Inscriptions on the Bihar Pillar.jpg|left|thumb|283x283px|Inscriptions on the Bihar Sharif pillar]]
A pillar dating to the 5th century from the time of the [[Gupta Empire]] was found near the fort of Bihar Sharif. It is 14&nbsp;ft tall and has two inscriptions inscribed upon it by two Gupta rulers, first of [[Kumaragupta]] (413-455 CE) and second of [[Skandagupta]] (456-480 CE).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Sahai |first=Bhagwant |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.532816 |title=Inscriptions Of Bihar |date=1983}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ahmad |first=Nisar |title=The Bihar Stone Inscription of the Guptas : Some Observations |date=1991 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/44142744 |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=52 |pages=1022–25 |jstor=44142744 |via=JSTOR}}</ref>

The name Bihar is derived from ''vihar'' or ''[[vihara]]'', meaning [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery, a reference to the ancient [[Odantapuri|Odantapuri University]] established near the city in the 7th century CE by [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king [[Gopala I]].<ref name="Brtnca">{{cite web|title=Bihar Sharif|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Bihar-Sharif|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="brit-odanta">{{cite web|title=Odantapuri|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Odantapuri|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref> The settlement does, however, predate the [[Buddha]]. It became the capital of the [[Magadha (Mahajanapada)|Magadha]] kingdom in the [[Pala Empire]].

[[File:Old ruined gate of the fort, Bihar.jpg|left|thumb|180x180px|Photograph of the old ruined gate of the fort at Bihar Sharif from 1870s. The fort is believed to have been part of Odantapuri.]]Odantapuri is considered to have been the second-oldest of India's [[Mahavihara]]s, and it is believed to have been located on or at the foot of Bari Pahari ({{langx|en|Big Hill}}), or in the present-day ''Gadh Par'' locality of Bihar Sharif.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |last1=Anupam |first1=Hitendra |year=2001 |title=Significance of Tibetan Sources in the Study of Odantapuri and Vikaramsila Mahavihars |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44148119 |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=61 |pages=424–428 |jstor=44148119}}</ref> According to [[Tibet]]an records it housed about 12,000 students and was an important centre of Buddhist learning. [[Acharya]] Sri Ganga of [[Vikramashila]] was a student there.

The Big Hill or Badi Pahadi was known as Pashravati at the time.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

Odantapuri was part of a network of five [[Mahavihara]]s in eastern India. The others were [[Nalanda]], [[Vikramashila]], [[Somapura Mahavihara|Somapura]], and [[Jagaddala Mahavihara|Jagaddala]]. During the Pala period, the state funding to Vikramshila and Odantapuri far exceeded what was granted to Nalanda. As a result, while Nalanda was struggling for survival around 11th century CE, Odantapuri had a rival institution thriving under the royal patronage of Palas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Patil |first=D.

===Conquests and dynastic transitions===
In 1193, during the time of [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji|Ikhtiyar ad-Din Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji]]'s conquest of Bihar, he came to conquer eastern parts of India and destroyed [[Nalanda]] University. En route to Nalanda, he allegedly damaged the Buddhist monasteries of a place now called [[Bakhtiyarpur]]. He then came to Vihar, where he completely destroyed [[Odantapuri]] University, and the Buddhist viharas before leaving for Nalanda. In Koshak, Nalanda, he appointed [[House of Hasib|Qazi Syed Ibrahim Danishmand]] as the Qazi-ul-Quzat of Bihar making him incharge of enforcing [[Sharia]] law in the region. A few years after Khilji's departure, local [[Bundela]] [[Rajput]] regained control of the city from its [[Islam|Muslim]] rulers. Bundela Rajputs then ruled the area until the reign of Raja Biththal.

Khaliji destroyed the [[Nalanda]], [[Vikramashila]], and Odantapuri universities during his raids across North Indian plains, massacring many [[Buddhist]] and [[Brahmin]] scholars.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sanyal|first=Sanjeev|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xu-O9eNmQXMC&pg=PT130|title=Land of seven rivers: History of India's Geography|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-671-5|pages=130–1}}</ref>|262x262px]]

The district of Nalanda formed a part of the territory under Muslim rulers of Bengal till 1320 AD when [[Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq]] separated Bihar from Bengal.

[[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultan]] [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] ({{abbr|r.|ruled}}1324–1351 CE) then sent [[Syed Ibrahim Mallick Baya|Syed Ibrahim Mallick]] with an army to conquer the Magadha region. After a fierce battle, the outnumbered Raja army was defeated and Raja Biththal was killed. The conquest of Bihar was a major achievement for Delhi, and on this occasion the Sultan conferred upon Syed Ibrahim Mallick the title of "Madarul Mulk", after which he was called "Mallick Baya". He was then appointed governor of Bihar by the Sultan, and he ruled over the region until his assassination in 1353 CE.

Its control passed into the hands of the Sherqui Dynasty of [[Jaunpur Sultanate|Jaunpur]] from 1394 to 1486 CE. After that it was amalgamated with the Muslim kingdom of [[Gauḍa (region)|Gauda]].

=== Later history ===
After the Delhi Sultanate, the first [[Sur Empire|Sur]] emperor, [[Sher Shah Suri]] (r.&nbsp;1540–1545&nbsp;CE), moved the regional capital to [[Patliputra]] (modern-day [[Patna]]), and the whole Magadha region came to be called Bihar. Before that the residence of the Muslim governors of Bihar remained at Bihar Sharif until 1541 CE. [[Patna]] became a central place and Bihar Sharif lost its importance. 

After that the [[British Empire|British]] took control of the entire city and it came under British colonial rule during the 18th and 19th centuries. The British period brought about changes in administration, infrastructure, and governance in Bihar Sharif and the surrounding region. In 1867, the city was officially declared a municipality.<ref name="Brtnca" />

===Modern period===
In the post-independence era, Bihar Sharif has continued to be an important center of culture, education, and commerce in Bihar. The city has witnessed urbanization and development, while still retaining its historical and cultural significance.
