'''Naju''' ({{Korean|hangul=나주}}; {{IPA|ko|na̞.dʑu}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[South Jeolla Province]], [[South Korea]].

The capital of [[South Jeolla]] was located at Naju until it was moved to [[Gwangju]] in 1895. The name [[Jeolla]] actually originates from the first character of [[Jeonju]] ({{Korean|labels=no|전|{{linktext|全}}}}) and the first character of Naju ({{Korean|labels=no|라|{{linktext|羅}}}}; nowadays spelled and pronounced 나/''na'' according to the South Korean standard). [[Dongshin University]] is situated in Naju. Naju is famous for the Naju Pear which is a large round pear that forms its district logo.

== History ==
* In the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] period of Korean history, [[Wang Geon]] (later [[Taejo of Goryeo]] Dynasty) occupied the Naju area, which was then part of [[Later Baekje]] Kingdom and came to become large base of his political support.  He also married the daughter of the Magistrate of Naju, Lady Janghwa, who became the mother of Goryeo's second King [[Hyejong of Goryeo]].<ref>Establishment of city and county according to [[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]](1981.4.13)</ref>
