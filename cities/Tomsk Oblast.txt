==History==
[[Image:RU033 09.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Postage stamps and postal history of Russia|Postage stamp]] depicting the oblast, issued in 2009]]
Long before Siberia became part of Russia, the territory of modern Tomsk Oblast was inhabited by people belonging to the [[taiga]] Kulayskoy civilization known for its bronze artifacts.

The development of the region began at the end of the 16th and early 17th centuries. The oldest settlement in the area is the [[village]] (former city) [[Narym]], founded in 1596.

The administrative center of the province, the city of Tomsk, was founded in 1604 by a decree of [[Tsar]] [[Boris Godunov]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=История Томской области {{!}} Администрация Томской области {{!}} Администрация Томской области|url=https://www.tomsk.gov.ru/history|website=www.tomsk.gov.ru|language=ru|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref> From 1719 to 1804 in the province of [[Tobolsk]]. In 1782, is formed by Tomskaya oblast in the composition of Tobolsky namestnichestva (from 1796 - Tobolskaya guberniya). In 1804 the [[Tomsk Governorate]] was founded,<ref name=":1" /> which existed until 1925, when it became part of the Siberian region (since 1930 - the West Siberian region). Tomsk Oblast was re-established on August 13, 1944.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> The city grew throughout the mid-20th century due to the migration of many Soviet institutions to Tomsk during [[World War II]], the development of nuclear facilities in the region during the 1950s, as well as the beginning of petroleum production in the oblast during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=":1" />

On July 26, 1995 the Oblast's charter was adopted.

==Politics==
[[File:Tomsk weisses Haus.jpg|thumb|Oblast Administration building in Tomsk, 2000]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Tomsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After the abolition of Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR in March 1990, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Tomsk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Duma of Tomsk Oblast]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Duma exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

The current Governor of the Tomsk Oblast is [[Vladimir Mazur]]. The Legislative Duma of the Tomsk Region consists of 42 deputies, and the current chairman is [[:ru:Козловская, Оксана Витальевна|Oksana Kozlovskaya]].

The deputies of the Duma of the Tomsk Oblast of the VI convocation (2016–2021) formed the following deputy associations:
* [[United Russia]] faction (27 deputies);
* [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] faction (4 deputies);
* [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] faction (9 deputies);
* [[A Just Russia – For Truth|A Just Russia]] faction (2 deputies).
