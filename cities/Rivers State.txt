The state is particularly noted for its [[linguistic diversity]], with 30 indigenous languages and dialects being said to be spoken in Rivers State, these include Ekpeye, Ikwerre, [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]] (Okrika, Ibani, Kalabari) and [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Languages of Rivers State of Nigeria: An Overview|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337102125|access-date=2021-03-09|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}</ref> Rivers State is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|25th largest state by area]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Public Finance Database |url=https://www.publicfinance.ngf.org.ng/state-budget/rivers-state/ |access-date=2022-09-18 |website=Nigeria Governors' Forum |language=en-US}}</ref> and its geography is dominated by the numerous rivers that flow through it, including the [[Bonny River]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-11-20 |title=Anger as 3 die in Bonny River boat mishap |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/11/anger-as-3-die-in-bonny-river-boat-mishap/ |access-date=2022-03-04 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[economy]] of Rivers State is dominated by the state's booming petroleum industry. Although the rise of the oil industry has led to increased revenue for the state government, mismanagement and corruption have prevented the state from rapid development and meaningfully tackling [[Poverty in Nigeria|poverty]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Politics as War: The Human Rights Impact and Causes of Post-Election Violence in Rivers State, Nigeria: Background: Root Causes of Violence in Rivers State|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/nigeria0308/4.htm|access-date=2021-03-09|website=www.hrw.org}}</ref>

Rivers State is considered one of the fastest-growing states in terms of modern infrastructure and urbanization in the country.

== History ==
=== Territory and status ===
Rivers State, named after the many rivers that border its territory, was part of the [[Oil Rivers Protectorate]] from 1885 till 1893 when it became part of the [[Niger Coast Protectorate]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oil Rivers {{!}} region, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Oil-Rivers |access-date=2022-03-11 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1900, the region was merged with the chartered territories of the [[Royal Niger Company]] to form the colony of [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria]]. The state was formed in 1967 with the split of the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] of Nigeria. In 1996 the state lost territory to form [[Bayelsa State]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-21|title=Soku oil field: Politics, law of who owns the land|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/12/soku-oil-field-politics-law-of-who-owns-the-land/|access-date=2021-09-10 |website=Vanguard News|language=en-US}}</ref>

===20th century===
In the early days of the [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial period]], several protection treaties were signed between various indigenous communities and the [[British Empire|British]] colonial government{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}. Between 1941 and 1952, agitation for the creation of Rivers Province began with the formation of the '''Ijo Rivers People's League'''. By 1953, the Council of Rivers Chiefs was birthed as a replacement body for the League, the same year, another organization, the '''Calabar Ogoja Rivers''' (COR) State Movement became existent.

The Council of Rivers Chiefs was later renamed in 1954 to Rivers Chiefs and People's Congress and in 1956, the organization became known as the Rivers Chiefs People's Conference.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-05-13 |title=We celebrated the creation of Rivers State in exile and bushes... The Nation Newspaper |url=https://thenationonlineng.net/celebrated-creation-rivers-state-exile-bushes/ |access-date=2022-09-18 |language=en-US}}</ref> Until 1958, hopes of an independent state resonated with the region and lingered consistently in the minds of its natives. During the constitutional conference that year, the country's nationhood was affirmed while an agreement was reached on some measures to mitigate the fears of the ethnic minorities in the area. Around this time, the COR State Movement had broken away to press their case. Thereafter, the British launched a commission led by [[Sir Henry Willink, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Willink]] to look into the misgivings of these autochthons. The Willink Commission initiated the conception of the [[Niger Delta]] Development Board (NDDB). The purpose was to tackle the problems of underdevelopment, however, this failed to rise to the expectations of the masses. After much discontent, some of the people attempted to take the extralegal route to achieve their goals.

In February 1966, [[Isaac Boro]], Sam Owonaro and Nottingham Dick alongside their supporters proclaimed a "Delta People's Republic". The rebellion persisted for twelve days but was resisted by the Federal and the old Eastern Nigeria government. On 27 May 1967, under the administration of [[Yakubu Gowon|General Yakubu Gowon]], Decree No. 14 was issued, allowing the creation of Rivers State. From then on, complaints about political marginalisation, [[environmental degradation]] and economic pauperisation remained among the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw groups]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ijo {{!}} people {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ijo |access-date=2022-03-11 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> such that a separate [[Bayelsa State]] was carved out of Rivers State by the military government of [[Sani Abacha]] on 1 October 1996 and Omuma Local Government Area of Rivers State was created on the same day to include communities such as Umuru in Ofeh.<ref name="history1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsha.gov.ng/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213093552/http://rsha.gov.ng/history.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 December 2012|title=History of Rivers State|publisher=Rsha.gov.ng|access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Rivers State is a predominantly low-lying [[pluvial]] state in southern Nigeria, located in the eastern part of the [[Niger Delta]] on the oceanward extension of the [[Benue Trough]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rivers {{!}} state, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rivers |access-date=2022-03-11 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> The inland part of the state consists of [[tropical rainforest]], and towards the coast, the typical Niger Delta environment features many [[mangrove swamps]]. Rivers State has a total area of {{cvt|11,077|sqkm}}, making it the [[List of Nigerian states by area|26th largest state]] in Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-18 |title=List Of States In The Niger Delta Region Of Nigeria {{!}} TheNigerianInfo |url=https://thenigerianinfo.com/list-of-states-in-niger-delta-region-of-nigeria/ |access-date=2022-08-26 |language=en-GB}}</ref> Surrounding states are [[Anambra]] for four km, [[Imo State|Imo]] for about 122&nbsp;km), and [[Abia State|Abia]] for 87&nbsp;km (54 miles, partly across the Imo River) to the north, [[Akwa Ibom]] to the east across the Imo River and [[Bayelsa]] and [[Delta State|Delta]] to the west across the Niger River for about 50&nbsp;km. On the south, it is bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Its topography ranges from flat plains, with a network of [[List of rivers of Rivers State|rivers]] to tributaries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}

=== Climate ===

[[File:Port Harcourt City Climate March.jpg|thumb|[[Ogoni]] Climate activists and others in Port Harcourt protesting environmental degradation in 2015.]]
Rainfall is generally seasonal, variable, as well as heavy, and occurs between March and October through November.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} The [[wet season]] peaks in July, lasting more than 290 days. The only dry months are January and February having little to no effect.

Total annual rainfall decreases from about {{convert|4700|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} on the coast, to about {{convert|1700|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the extreme north. It is {{convert|4698|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Bonny, Rivers State|Bonny]] along the coast and {{convert|1862|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Degema, Rivers State|Degema]]. For [[Port Harcourt]], temperatures throughout the year are relatively constant with little variation throughout the seasons. Average temperatures are typically between {{cvt|25 and 28|°C}}. Some parts of the state still receive up to {{convert|150|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall during the dry period. Relative humidity rarely dips below 60% and fluctuates between 90% and 100% for most of the year.

=== Terrain ===
The land surface of Rivers State can be divided into three zones: freshwater swamps, [[mangrove swamp]]s and coastal sand ridges. The freshwater zone extends northwards from the [[mangrove swamps]]. This land surface is generally less than 20m above sea level. As a lower Niger [[floodplain]], it contains a greater [[silt]] and [[clay]] foundation and is more susceptible to perennial inundation by river floods. The floodplain's total thickness rises to about 45m in the northeast and over 9m in the [[beach ridge]] barrier zones to the southwest.

On coastal sand ridges, the soils are mostly sandy or sandy loams. Various crops are supported including [[coconut]], [[oil palm]], [[raffia palm]] and [[cocoyam]]. The drier upland region of Rivers State covers 61% of landmass while the riverine areas, with a relief range of 2m to 5m, take up 39%.

=== Flora and fauna ===

Due to its geographical location, Rivers State has always played an important role in the [[natural history]] of Nigeria, having been found to host a vast array of wildlife and plants. Its tropical rainforests are home to more species than all other local [[biome]]s combined thanks to its climate and [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] structure. Some of the upland forested areas have seen disruption from human activity, impacting negatively on the [[biodiversity]] and [[ecological]]  functions of [[natural habitat]]s. In most places, the dominant vegetation usually consists of ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]'' which has the highest productivity amongst all recognized oleaginous crops.

The riverine part of the state has three hydro-vegetation zones such as [[beach ridge]], salt water and fresh water. Each zone has its characteristics and composition, with the freshwaters encompassing the upper and lower floodplains of the [[Niger Delta]].

[[Finima Nature Park]] is a protected area and [[forest reserve]] on [[Bonny Island]] covering an area of approximately {{cvt|10|km2}}. The park's vegetation has progressively developed into a high [[forest]] considering the form from which it began in 1999. There are two storeys that can be distinguished from outside the forest, the emergents include ''[[Symphonia globulifera]]'', ''Cleistopholis patens'', ''[[Uapaca]]'' spp., ''[[Musanga cecropioides]]'', ''[[Hallea ledermannii]]'', ''[[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]]'' spp., ''[[Anthostema|Anthostema aubryanum]]'', ''[[Tectona grandis]]'' and ''Elaeis guineensis''. The [[understory]] is composed mainly of ''[[Calamus (palm)|Calamus deeratus]]'', ''[[Alchornea cordifolia]]'', ''[[Monodora|Monodora tenuifolia]]'', ''[[Harungana madagascariensis]]'', ''[[Strophanthus preussii]]'', ''[[Rauvolfia vomitoria]]'' and ''[[Raffia palm|Raphia]]'' spp.

The interior of the forest is very shady and as a result a wide variety of [[shade tolerant]] [[forbs]] (e.g. ''[[Nephrolepis biserrata]]'', ''[[Culcasia scandens]]'', ''[[Laportea]]'' spp., ''[[Chromolaena odorata]]'', ''[[Aframomum melegueta]]'' and ''[[Costus|Costus afer]]'') and various sedges form thickets on the forest floor. By dry season, a large cushion of litter cover the floor because of increase in [[abscission]] rate of some plants such as ''[[Musanga cecropioides]]'', ''[[Hallea ledermannii]]'', ''Calamus deeratus'', ''[[Gmelina arborea]]'', ''[[Raffia palm|Raphia]]'' spp. and ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]''.

[[Mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s are also found in the park. The common mammals are [[mona monkey]]s and [[pygmy hippopotamus]]es. Among the [[reptiles]] and [[amphibians]] are [[snake]]s and [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[frog]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[skink]]s.

One of the world's [[Ramsar Convention]]-listed [[wetland]]s, [[Upper Orashi Forest]], is a {{cvt|252|km2}} protected area in [[Ahoada West]]. It has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area|IBA]] because of its importance to global populations of [[grey parrot]]s and other birds.<ref name="IBA">{{cite web|title=Upper Orashi forest|url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/factsheet/upper-orashi-forests-iba-nigeria|access-date=8 August 2017|publisher=[[Birdlife International]]|date=7 September 2008}}</ref> The [[Biseni Forest]] in the north west of [[Ahoada]] and west of Upper Orashi Forest have also been designated an Important Bird Area.

The earliest known settled communities in what is now Rivers State include the Riverine [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]]; [[Ogoni]], [[Ikwerre people]] and other Igboid groups on the mainland.<ref name="Omabala2">{{cite book|author=Omabala Aguleri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IE8CBAAAQBAJ|title=Igbo History Hebrew Exiles of Eri|date=13 July 2014|publisher=eBookIt.com|isbn=978-1456622206|access-date=5 August 2017}}</ref> Today, over 26 distinct groups are recognized by the [[Rivers State government]], each with its own language, lifestyle, and cultural heritage.

[[Multilingualism]] is a part of everyday life for the population of Rivers State and most of Nigeria. English, inherited from [[British Nigeria|colonial rule]] is common and widely spoken in various forms in different localities. Some indigenous Riverians are also bilingual, speaking a mixture of English or [[Pidgin English]] with one of the native languages. This is partly due to the frequent exposure of the younger generations to foreign dialects, especially in the country's largest cities.<ref name="Fardon45"/> Excluding Pidgin, all other ones spoken in the state belong to either [[Benue–Congo]] or [[Ijoid]] and [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]] Languages within the [[Niger–Congo language family]]. The Benue–Congo is subdivided into [[Cross River languages|Cross River]], [[Igboid]], and [[Edoid]] groups. The Ijoid languages are predominant around the creek belt, [[Ogoni languages]] - about 5 of them are spoken across the southern parts of the state, Igboid group of language is spoken in the Northern Areas of the Rivers State.<ref name="Fardon45">{{cite book|author1=Richard Fardon|author2=Graham Furniss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyGIAgAAQBAJ |title=African Languages, Development and the State|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134868049|page=66|access-date=6 August 2017}}</ref>

Rivers State has maintained its importance as a leading supplier of wealth to the nation for centuries. In 2021, the state ranked 2nd nationwide with a [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of $51.529 billion and a per capita income of $5,949 (PPP).<ref name="C-GIDD GDP">{{cite web |date=2022-10-13 |editor-last=Okeowo |editor-first=Gabriel |editor2-last=Fatoba |editor2-first=Iyanuoluwa |title=State of States 2022 Edition |url=https://yourbudgit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-State-of-states_Official.pdf |access-date=2023-03-07 |website=Budgit.org |publisher=BudgIT |publication-date=2022-10-13}}</ref>

===Natural resources===
The state is famous for its vast reserves of crude oil and natural gas. It was perhaps the richest and most important section of the African zone of the British Empire. Rivers State has two major oil refineries, two major seaports, airports, and various industrial estates spread across the land. More than 60% of the country's output of crude oil is produced in the state. Other natural resources found within its boundaries are silica, glass sand and clay.<ref name="niger delta"/>

===Agriculture===
Prior to the discovery of oil in commercial quantity in 1951, Agriculture was the primary occupation of the people of Rivers State. Around the 19th century when the Industrial Revolution reached its peak in England, the area was then referred to as [[Oil Rivers Protectorate]], this was due to its abundant [[palm oil]] and [[Palm kernel|kernel]] which basically constituted the main revenue source of the country. In a sample survey carried out by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, about 40% of the rural inhabitants were committed to farming in 1983. Rivers State is one of the leading states in the production of [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]], [[cocoyam]], [[maize]], [[rice]] and [[bean]]s. About 39% (760,000 hectares) of the state's total land mass, particularly in the upland area, is suitable for cultivation. Major cash crops produced are [[Oil palm|oil palm products]], [[rubber]], [[coconut]], [[raffia palm]] and [[jute]]. Other crops grown for food include [[vegetable]]s, [[melon]], [[pineapple]]s, [[mango]], pepper, [[banana]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. The fishing industry is an important sector in Rivers State.  Besides being lucrative, fishing is also a favourite pastime activity. There are approximately 270 species of fish existing; with many artisanal fishermen in the riverine areas. The state provides valuable seafood such as [[crab]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Shrimps (food)|shrimps]] and [[sea snail]]s among others. Vertebrates like [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s and [[reptile]]s are also found in the region.<ref name="niger delta">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/504930/Rivers|title=Rivers|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref>

== Infrastructure ==
===Energy===
{{wide image|Oil Factory - panoramio (cropped).jpg|500px|align-cap=center|Oil facility at [[Bonny Island]]}}
Energy, and especially electricity is the key factor for economic growth. Rivers State has one of the nation's highest per capita energy consumption rates. As of 2012, it had a power generation capacity of 400 [[megawatts]], a significant improvement over a meagre 30 megawatts during the late nineties.<ref name="Tide7">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2012/05/27/power-sector-transformation-in-rivers|title=Power Sector Transformation In Rivers State|date=27 May 2012|work=[[The Tide (Nigeria)|The Tide]]|access-date=30 July 2017}}</ref> Its energy sector is protected by the government through legislation and funding. It is overseen by the ministries of [[Rivers State Ministry of Power|Power]], [[Rivers State Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources|Energy and Natural Resources]]. The state's oil-refining capacity is the biggest in the country, with more than 340,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

There's a vast untapped potential in the state for solar power. Interest in solar energy has been increasing but not much has been invested. Up to now, energy production has been insufficient to meet demand, resulting in frequent power outages, slow manufacturing and low business performance.

===Transportation===
{{wide image|Port Harcourt international airport.jpg|500px|align-cap=center|[[Port Harcourt International Airport]], Omagwa}}
Transportation within Rivers State is mainly land and water-based. The industry has the [[Rivers State Ministry of Transport|Ministry of Transport]] as its chief regulating body. Apart from roads and waterways, there are functional [[aerodrome|airdromes]] that provide out-of-state transport. The seaports contain harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land.

Federal highways are [[A2 highway (Sri Lanka)|A2]] the Elele-Alimini-Patani East-West Rd from [[Elele]] to [[Bayelsa State]] at Mbiama, [[A3 highway (Nigeria)|A3]] east as the Port Harcourt Enugu Expressway to [[Abia State]] and [[A231 highway (Nigeria)|A231]] north from A3 in [[Port Harcourt]] 42&nbsp;km via Igwuruta and Omagwa to A2 in Elele.

Other major roads include 
* the Owerri-Ahoada Rd northeast to [[Imo State]], 
* the Abua-Ogbia Rd north to [[Ahoada]] where the Ogura-Omoku Rd continues to Imo State, 
* the Rumuji-Mpakurche Rd northwest from Port Harcourt to the Rumuji-Elele Alimini Rd, 
* the Ulakwo Rd northeast from Olakwo to Imo State, 
* the Eberi-Obiga Rd north from Owaza to Abia State, 
* the Asa-Akwere-Obohia Rd east from Owaza to Abia State, and 
* the Alese Rd southeast from Port Harcourt to the Ikot Akan-Deyor Chara Rd across the [[Imo River]] at Kalaoko to [[Akwa Ibom State]].

[[Taxicabs]], buses and ferries dominate public transport. They are usually inexpensive and are often used for multi-passenger pick-ups. Commercial vehicles in Port Harcourt maintain sky blue, white and sky blue [[livery]]. Operating without these government-approved colours is punishable with a fine of up to ₦10,000.<ref name="Tide3">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2014/02/05/the-hazards-of-unpainted-taxis/|title=The Hazards Of Unpainted Taxis|date=5 February 2014|work=[[The Tide (Nigeria)|The Tide]]|access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>

The 1067&nbsp;mm Cape Gauge [[Nigerian Railway Corporation|Eastern Railway Line]] north from Port Harcourt to Aba in Abia State, built 1913–16, restored 2009–15.

Both domestic and international flights are available from [[Port Harcourt International Airport]]. Airlines such as [[Lufthansa]], [[Air France]], [[Qatar Airways|Qatar Air]], [[Ethiopian Airlines]], [[Med-View Airline|Med-View]], [[Air Peace]] and [[Cronos Airlines|Cronos]] link the state to destinations including [[Frankfurt]], [[Paris]], [[Lagos]] and [[Malabo]]. Passengers can easily get a taxi or rental car at the authorized vehicle area. Companies like [[Europcar]], [[Avis Rent a Car|Avis]] and [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]] have offices near the airport. In addition, the [[Port Harcourt NAF Base|Port Harcourt Air Force Base]] is located in the state capital. It gained popularity as a commercial destination due to the closure of the international airport. After that airport reopened, most airlines abandoned the base. However, it still has some destinations since the airport is closer to the centre than the main airport.

Seaports handle much more diversified import cargo activities than airports. The [[Onne|Port of Onne]] is one of the largest and busiest seaports in the country. Its [[mobile crane|mobile harbour cranes]] are one of the biggest in Africa, with a lifting capacity of 208 metric tonnes. Another important seaport is the [[Port of Port Harcourt]]. It was the second-largest port in Nigeria in the 1950s. In 1954, it cleared about $54 million worth of imports and exports, while the shipping facilities at [[Calabar]] cleared $11 million worth of goods.<ref>{{cite book |last= Information Service |date=1956 |title=Eastern Region (Nigeria) |location=Enugu |publisher=Enugu, Eastern Nigeria Information Service}}</ref>

===Water===
The majority of Riverians obtain their water for household use from vendors. There are also those who extract their water from private [[borehole]]s and [[Water well|wells]] and incur costs for the investment, maintenance, spare parts, pumping, and in some cases treating the water. Several others receive their domestic water from [[rainwater harvesting|rainwater catchments]], nearby streams or rivers. In the oil-bearing communities, many residents have easy access to basic infrastructure systems, although, most of the facilities are nonfunctional.<ref name="UrbanWater">{{cite web|title=Urban Water Sector Reform And Port Harcourt Water Supply And Sanitation Project|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/Nigeria_-_Urban_Water_Sector_Reform_and_Port-Harcourt_Water_Supply_and_Sanitation_Project_-_Appraisal_Report.pdf|access-date=3 August 2017|publisher=[[AfDB]]}}</ref>

In large urban localities such as Port Harcourt and [[Obio-Akpor]], Port Harcourt Water Corporation handles the provision of urban water supply and wastewater management services for 15% of the population. A number of towns and villages with iron-contaminated H<sub>2</sub>O have resorted to treating one chemical contaminant with another. Most of the water collection in low-income urban residential areas is done by women.<ref name="UrbanWater"/> In 2008, [[Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey|NDHS]] reported that 26% of adult females collect drinking water more than adult male counterparts at 21%.<ref name="UrbanWater"/>

In order to improve access to safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable water supply services, [[USAID]], through its Sustainable Water and Sanitation in Africa program collaborated with the [[Rivers State Ministry of Water Resources and Rural Development|Ministry of Water Resources and Rural Development]] from April 2013 to June 2015.<ref name="USAID">{{cite web|title=Regulatory Water Sector Reforms in Rivers State|url=http://usaid-suwasa.org/index.php/projects-and-activities/nigeria/item/268-regulatory-water-sector-reforms-in-rivers-state|access-date=3 August 2017|publisher=[[USAID]]|archive-date=7 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107222445/http://usaid-suwasa.org/index.php/projects-and-activities/nigeria/item/268-regulatory-water-sector-reforms-in-rivers-state}}</ref>

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Government of Rivers State|Politics of Rivers State}}
The Rivers State government consists of elected representatives and appointed officials. The state government has executive and legislative branches, with an [[Judiciary of Rivers State|independent judiciary]]. At the local level, elected officials are responsible for local government areas.

===Electoral System===
The governor of the state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of votes and over 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the state local government areas. If no candidate passes the threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

===Executive===
The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Rivers State|Governor]], assisted by the [[Deputy Governor of Rivers State|Deputy Governor]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Your-Title-Here |url=https://www.riversstate.gov.ng/executive |access-date=2022-03-12 |website=www.riversstate.gov.ng |language=en}}</ref> both elected for a term of 4 years (maximum of 2 terms). The governor appoints commissioners responsible for each of the ministries and appoints the heads of parastatals and the state-owned bodies with specific regulatory or administrative duties. In some cases, a governor may be replaced or removed for example, through death, impeachment or if an election is annulled by a competent court of law or by a two-thirds majority of the House of Assembly.
The incumbent governor is Siminalayi Fubara a member of the People Democratic Party, who heads the council of Rivers State. Fubara was sworn in on 29 May 2023. He is the 7th Democratic governor of the state and the 16th overall governor of River State<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-30|title=Wetin you suppose know about Nyesom Wike #BBCGovDebate|url=https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-47061040|access-date=2022-01-10|website=BBC News Pidgin}}</ref>
