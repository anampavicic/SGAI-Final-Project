==History==
Euro-American settlement began in the early 1850s, and the [[population density]] remained very low until 1904 when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a [[rail yard|switch yard]] and maintenance sheds there, after moving the division point from [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]]. In 1902, the Southern Pacific purchased a large tract of swamp-like land near its newly built railyard, and gave employees clear deed to a {{convert|50|x|140|ft|m|abbr=on}} lot for the [[Peppercorn (law)|sum of $1]]. It also offered to pick up and move every house in Wadsworth and reassemble it in this new town free of charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.up.com/goldenspike/sacramento-promontory.html#sparks_nv |website=Union Pacific Railroad |access-date=17 September 2018 |title=The Great Race to Promontory }}</ref>  As the population increased, a city was established, first called Harriman, after [[E. H. Harriman]], president of the Southern Pacific, and then renamed Sparks, after [[John Sparks (Nevada politician)|John Sparks]], then [[List of Governors of Nevada|governor of Nevada]].<ref name="Toll2002"/><ref name="Myrick2007">{{cite book |last=Myrick |first=David F. |title=Railroads of Nevada and Eastern California: The Southern Roads |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a8UC-W50fYkC&pg=PA868 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Nevada Press |location=Reno, NV |isbn=978-0-87417-194-5 |page=868}}</ref>

Sparks remained a small town until the 1950s, when economic growth in Reno triggered a housing boom north of the railroad in the area of Sparks. During the 1970s, the area south of the railroad started to fill up with warehouses and light industry. In 1984, the tower for the [[Nugget Casino Resort]] was finished, giving Sparks its first, and currently only, high-rise [[casino]].<ref name="KlingMelton2010">{{cite book |last1=Kling|first1=Dwayne|last2=Melton|first2=Rollan|title=The Rise of the Biggest Little City: An Encyclopedic History of Reno Gaming, 1931–1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ok2zw7T2S6oC&pg=PA3 |date=August 2010 |publisher=University of Nevada Press |location=Reno, NV |isbn=978-0-87417-829-6 |page=3}}</ref> In 1996, the redevelopment effort of the B Street business district across from the Nugget that started in the early 1980s took a step forward with the opening of a multi-screen movie complex and the construction of a plaza area.

Under direction of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], a comprehensive dynamic water quality [[computer model]], the [[DSSAM Model]], was developed (Earth Metrics, 1987) to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and [[stormwater]] management decisions throughout the {{convert|3120|sqmi|adj=on}} [[Truckee River]] basin; this model was used to develop a set of [[surface runoff]] stormwater management measures for Sparks in the 1980s.<ref>C.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
[[File:2015-10-27 15 36 28 View west along Interstate 80 in Sparks, Nevada from an airplane landing at Reno-Tahoe International Airport.jpg|thumb|right|I-80 runs through central Sparks.]]
The [[Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County]] (RTC) operates a city bus system that services the cities of Reno and Sparks.

Sparks is served by the nearby [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]].

====Rail====
The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] runs east–west through the center of Sparks. The Union Pacific has a significant [[rail yard]] south of I-80, just south and adjacent to the Nugget Hotel/Casino towers in downtown Sparks, and is a central part of the area's [[industrial park]]. Passenger rail service to the [[Sparks (Amtrak station)|Sparks Amtrak Station]] ended in 2009, although service continues in neighboring Reno by the [[California Zephyr]].

====Roads====
[[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]] runs east–west through Sparks. [[Nevada State Route 445|State Route 445 (Pyramid Way)]], El Rancho Drive, Sullivan Lane, Rock Boulevard, Sparks Boulevard, Vista Boulevard, and [[Nevada State Route 659|State Route 659 (McCarran Blvd)]] are the city's major north–south thoroughfares. Pyramid Way runs from Nugget Avenue in downtown Sparks to [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], about 35 miles north of the city, and has been designated a [[Nevada Scenic Byway]].

Sparks is connected directly to south Reno by the Southeast Connector. It is a northerly extension of Veterans Parkway to the  Sparks Boulevard at Greg Street. It serves as an expressway, with only 2 signaled intersections along its 5.5 mile stretch (one at Pembroke Drive and one at Mira Loma Drive), and constitutes a major arterial connection between Reno and Sparks. It provides an alternative route to existing, overcrowded routes such as the US-395/I-580 freeway, Rock Boulevard, and McCarran Boulevard. Construction began in late 2013, and was completed in July 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2018/06/28/southeast-connector-reno-sparks-commute-opens-july-6/740583002/|title=Southeast Connector opens next week, could save 14 minutes on your Reno-Sparks commute|last=Higdon|first=Mike|website=Reno Gazette Journal|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>

Sparks also is gearing up for the record of decision on a major, $1.1 billion (estimated) arterial road project, one that will turn a large portion of Pyramid Highway through nearby Spanish Springs into a controlled access, high speed arterial road that connects directly with the US 395 freeway via a complex interchange at the current Parr Boulevard connection. This will directly connect Spanish Springs, a major population center (parts of which are annexed with the city of Sparks), located in the valley just north of Sparks, with the existing Reno/Sparks freeway system which consists currently of Interstate 80 and US 395. This project will also offer more direct freeway system and inter-valley connections to and from Sun Valley, another major population center of the Reno/Sparks metropolitan statistical area. Sun Valley is located just north of Reno and just west of Spanish Springs, and is home to just over 20,000 residents as of 2020.
