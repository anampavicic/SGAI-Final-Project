[[Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]] missionary-explorer, is considered the first European explorer to have visited the area in 1776. He was guided by two Timpanogos Utes, whom he called Silvestre and Joaquín.<ref name=Joaquin>{{cite web|url=http://www.provo.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=2258|title=Joaquin Neighborhood Plan pg. 3 :: City of Provo|access-date=January 19, 2017|archive-date=February 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225000113/http://www.provo.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=2258|url-status=dead}}</ref> Escalante chronicled this first European exploration across the [[Great Basin Desert]]. The Europeans did not build a permanent settlement but traded with the Timpanogos, whom they called Lagunas (lake people) or Come Pescado (fish eaters).<ref name=Virginia />

In 1847, the [[Mormon pioneers]] arrived in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], which was just north of [[Mount Timpanogos|Timpanogos Mountain]]. At first, the Natives were friendly with the Mormons. But, as relations deteriorated with the Shoshoni and Utes because of disputes over land and cattle, tensions rose. Because of the reported stolen goods of settlers by the Utes, Brigham Young gave small militia orders "to take such measures as would put a final end to their [Indian] depredations in future." This ended in what is known as the [[Battle Creek massacre]], in modern-day [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]].
 
The Mormons continued pushing into Timpanog lands. In 1849, 33 [[Mormon]] families from Salt Lake City established [[Fort Utah]]. In 1850, Brigham Young sent an army from Salt Lake to drive out the Timpanogos in what is called the [[Provo War]].<ref name=mailed_fist>{{cite web|url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/ref/collection/USHSArchPub/id/7265|title=Utah Historical Quarterly Volume XLVI :: Utah State Historical Society - Historic and Prehistoric Publications|access-date=July 23, 2016|archive-date=August 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817130542/http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/ref/collection/USHSArchPub/id/7265|url-status=dead}}</ref> Escalating tensions with the Timpanog contributed to the [[Walkara#Walker War|Walker War]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Fort Utah was renamed Provo in 1850 for [[Étienne Provost]],<ref>{{Citation | last = Cannon | first = Kenneth | title = Utah History Encyclopedia | publisher = University of Utah Press | year = 1994 | chapter = Provo | chapter-url = https://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/p/PROVO.shtml | url = https://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20221103115958/https://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/p/PROVO.shtml | archive-date = November 3, 2022 | isbn =9780874804256 | access-date = March 26, 2024}}</ref> an early [[French-Canadian]] trapper who arrived in the region in 1825.

As more [[Latter-day Saints]] arrived, Provo quickly grew as a city. It soon was nicknamed ''The Garden City'' with a large number of fruit orchards and gardens there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utah.com/destinations/cities-towns/provo/things-to-do/history/|title=Provo - History|website=www.utah.com}}</ref>

In 1872, a railroad reached Provo. It was also this year that the Provo Woolen Mills opened. They were the first large factory in Provo and employed about 150 people, initially mainly skilled textile laborers who had emigrated from Britain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://historytogo.utah.gov/places/olympic_locations/historyofprovo.html |title=Utah History to Go article on Provo |access-date=May 27, 2018 |archive-date=March 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317125714/http://historytogo.utah.gov/places/olympic_locations/historyofprovo.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:RockCanyon.jpg|thumb|Rock Canyon in Provo]]

Provo lies on the eastern bank of [[Utah Lake]] in  [[Utah Valley]] at an elevation of {{convert|4549|ft}}. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of {{convert|114.4|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|107.9|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|6.5|km2|order=flip}}, or 5.66%, is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Provo city, Utah |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=March 8, 2012 }}</ref>

The [[Wasatch Range]] contains many peaks within [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]] along the east side of the [[Wasatch Front]]. One of them, known as [[Y Mountain]], towers over the city. There is a large [[hillside letter]] ''Y'' made of whitewashed concrete halfway up the steep mountain, built in the early part of the 20th century to commemorate BYU (original plans included construction use of all three letters). Wild deer (and less frequently, [[cougar]]s, and [[moose]]) still roam the mountains (and occasionally the city streets). The geography allows for hiking, [[skiing]], [[fishing]] and other outdoor activities.

===Climate===
Provo's climate can be classified as either a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] classification ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') or as a [[semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid climate]] (Köppen: ''BSk''). Overall, annual rainfall at the location of BYU is around {{convert|17.23|in|mm|-1|sp=us}}; however, the western part of the metropolitan area near Orem is substantially drier, receiving only around {{convert|13.5|in|mm|-1|sp=us}} of precipitation and consequently has a [[semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid climate]] (Köppen: ''BSk'').<ref name = NOAA /> The wettest calendar year in Provo has been 1983 with {{convert|37.54|in|mm|1}} and the driest 2020 with {{convert|7.28|in|mm|1}}.<ref name = NOAA />
 
Winters are cold with substantial snowfall averaging {{convert|57.2|in|cm|sp=us}} and a record monthly total of {{convert|66.0|in|cm|sp=us}} in January 1918, during which the record snow cover of {{convert|34|in|cm}} was recorded on the 17th. Seasonal snowfall has ranged from {{convert|127.5|in|cm|sp=us}} in 1983–84 to {{convert|10.1|in|cm|sp=us}} in 2014–15. Very cold weather may occur when cold air from over the [[Continental Divide]] invades the region: although only four mornings fall to or below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} during an average winter and this temperature was not reached at all between 1999 and 2006, during the very cold January 1917 (average temperature {{convert|14.9|F|C|1|disp=semicolon}}), seventeen mornings fell this cold.<ref name = NOAA /> By contrast, in several recent winters like 1994–95, 1995–96, 1999–2000, 2004–05, and 2005–06, averages have been above freezing every month.
 
Temperatures warm rapidly during the spring, with the first afternoon over {{convert|70|F|C|1}} on March 21, the last freeze expected on April 29, and the first temperature equal to or hotter than {{convert|90|F|C|1}} on May 30. Rainfall is not infrequent during the spring: over {{convert|5.10|in|mm|-1|sp=us}} was recorded in the Mays of 1995 and 2011, and a total of {{convert|12.29|in|mm|1}} fell during the four-month span of March to June 2005 – in contrast as little as {{convert|2.04|in|mm|1}} fell in the same months of 2012.<ref name = NOAA />
 
Being too far north to gain any influence from [[North American Monsoon|the monsoon]] except in rare cases like the {{convert|4.38|in|mm|1}} of rainfall of August 1983, Provo's summers are hot and dry, though relatively short – no maxima above {{convert|100|F|C|1}} have been recorded outside the range of June 7 to August 27. Monthly maxima average over {{convert|91|F|C|1}} in July and August, and precipitation averages under one inch per month with a two-month total in 2016 as low as {{convert|0.06|in|mm|1|sp=us}}. The hottest month on record is July 2003 with a mean of {{convert|81.8|F|C|1}}, and a mean maximum of {{convert|99.0|F|C|1}}. The hottest temperature on record is {{convert|108|F|C|1}} on July 13, 2002.<ref name = NOAA />
 
The fall season sees steady cooling and a transition to winter weather, with rare influences of rain systems from further south, as in the record wet month of September 1982, which saw {{convert|6.53|in|mm|1}} of total precipitation, including {{convert|4.15|in|mm|1}} over the last six days from a storm moving in from Arizona. The last maximum of {{convert|90|°F|°C|1}} can be expected around September 10, and the first morning below freezing on October 14.<ref name = NOAA />
