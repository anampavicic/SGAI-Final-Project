'''Surat Thani''' ({{langx|th|สุราษฎร์ธานี}}, {{IPA|th|sù.râːt tʰāː.nīː|pron}}), often shortened to '''Surat''', is the largest of the [[Southern Thailand|southern]] [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]] (''changwat'') of [[Thailand]]. It lies on the western shore of the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Surat Thani means 'city of good people', a title given to the city by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI); Surat Thani is therefore the sole province in Southern Thailand for which the native name is in the [[Thai language|Central Thai language]].

==Geography==
Surat Thani Province, located in Thailand, is bordered by the provinces of [[Chumphon Province|Chumphon]] to the north, [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province|Nakhon Si Thammarat]] to the east, [[Krabi Province|Krabi]] to the south, [[Phang Nga Province|Phang Nga]] to the southwest, and [[Ranong Province|Ranong]] to the northwest.

The geographic landscape of Surat Thani is diverse. The central region of the province is dominated by the coastal plain of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]], characterized by a mix of grassland, rubber trees, palm oil trees, and coconut plantations. To the west lie the [[limestone]] mountains of the [[Phuket mountain range|Phuket range]], largely enveloped in forest, home to the renowned [[Khao Sok National Park]]. The eastern part of the province sees the commencement of the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat mountain range|Nakhon Si Thammarat (or Bantat)]] mountain range, a portion of which is preserved within [[Tai Rom Yen National Park]]. The total forest area in Surat Thani is approximately {{cvt|3,764|km2|mi2|}}, accounting for 28.8 percent of the province's area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forest.go.th |title=ตารางที่ 2 พี้นที่ป่าไม้ แยกรายจังหวัด พ.ศ.2562 |year=2019 |department=Royal Forest Department |language=Thai |trans-title=Table 2 Forest area Separate province year 2019 |access-date=6 April 2021 |postscript=, information, Forest statistics Year 2019}}</ref>

Several islands in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] are part of Surat Thani, including popular tourist destinations such as [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Pha Ngan]] and [[Ko Tao]], as well as the [[Ko Angthong|Ko Ang Thong]] Marine National Park.

The province is also defined by its main waterways, the Tapi River and the [[Phum Duang River]], which converge near the town of Tha Kham before emptying into [[Bandon Bay]]. The [[river delta|delta]] formed by these rivers, known locally as ''Nai Bang'' (ในบาง), is situated directly north of Surat Thani city. This delta features a network of channels interspersed with small islands, predominantly covered by [[mangroves]] and orchards.

===National parks===
There are a total of eight national parks, six of which are in [[Protected Areas Regional Offices of Thailand|region 4 (Surat Thani)]] and Hat Khanom–Mu Ko Thale Tai and Namtok Si Khit are in [[Protected Areas Regional Offices of Thailand|region 5 (Nakhon Si Thammarat)]] of Thailand's protected areas.

==History==
The region of Surat Thani has a long history of human habitation, dating back to prehistoric times. It was initially inhabited by indigenous [[Semang]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malayan]] tribes. In the 3rd century, the area came under the influence of the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom, a powerful entity that controlled much of the [[Malay Peninsula]] until the 13th century. The city of [[Chaiya]], located in modern-day Surat Thani, is home to several archaeological ruins from the Srivijaya period, indicating its historical significance. There is a belief among some Thai historians that Chaiya may have served as a regional, or possibly even the primary capital of the Srivijaya kingdom, although this assertion remains a subject of scholarly debate. Another notable settlement from this era was [[Wiang Sa District, Surat Thani|Wiang Sa]], which also played a significant role during the time of Srivijaya's dominance.

[[File:Chaiya Wat Kaew.jpg|left|thumb|Wat Kaew in Chaiya, dating from Srivijavan times.]]
Following the decline of the Srivijaya kingdom, the region was partitioned into the cities (''[[mueang]]'') of Chaiya, Thatong (present-day [[Kanchanadit]]), and Khirirat Nikhom. Chaiya was governed directly from the Thai capital, whereas Thatong and Khirirat Nikhom came under the jurisdiction of the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]]. In 1899, these cities were amalgamated to form a single province named Chaiya. 

In 1915, significant administrative changes occurred. The capital city of the [[Monthon]] [[Monthon Surat Thani|Chumphon]] was relocated the city from [[Chaiya district|Chaiya]] to [[Mueang Surat Thani District|Bandon]]. During a visit by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) on 29 July 1915, Bandon was renamed ''Surat Thani'', a change possibly inspired by the major port city of Surat in [[Gujarat]], [[India]]. Concurrently, the Monthon was also renamed Surat. In 1926, this Monthon was abolished and integrated into Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat. Following the dissolution of the monthon system in 1933, Surat Thani was established as a first-level administrative division, gaining the status of a province. [[File:Borom That Chaiya.jpg|upright|thumb|right|160px|Srivijaya or Sailendra-style pagoda, Chaiya.]]

The administrative headquarters of Surat Thani Province were originally housed in a building located in Tha Kham, within the [[Phunphin District]]. Before [[World War II]], the administrative center was relocated to the city of Surat Thani, situated along the Tapi River. This river shares its name with the [[Tapti River|Tapi River]] in [[Surat]], located in the southern region of Gujarat, India. 

During the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] on 8 December 1941, the administrative building in Surat Thani was destroyed amidst the conflict that engulfed the city. The building was eventually reconstructed in 1954. However, on 19 March 1982, the building was targeted in a bombing by communist insurgents, resulting in its destruction and the tragic loss of five lives. 

Following this incident, a new provincial administration building was constructed at a different location, south of the city center. The site of the former provincial hall has since been repurposed and now hosts the [[Lak Mueang|city pillar shrine]] (''Lak Mueang''). This third and current administrative building continues to serve as the provincial government's headquarters.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal of Surat Thani prominently features the [[pagoda]] of [[:th:วัดพระบรมธาตุไชยาราชวรวิหาร|Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya]], a historic structure believed to have been constructed approximately 1,200 years ago.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya Ratcha Worawihan, Surat Thani province |url=https://thailandtourismdirectory.go.th/en/info/attraction/detail/itemid/5196 |website=Thailand Tourism Directory |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> The design of the provincial flag incorporates the image of this pagoda, set against a background divided horizontally with orange on the top half and yellow on the bottom.

Surat Thani's provincial flower is the bua phut (''[[Rafflesia kerrii]]''), noted for being a [[parasite|parasitic]] plant that produces some of the largest flowers among all plant species. The [[list of Thai provincial trees|provincial tree]] is identified as the ton kiam (''[[Cotylelobium melanoxylon]]''). The Rafflesia flower, can be found in Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani. [[Asian arowana|Asian green arowana]] (''[[Scleropages formosus]]'') is the provincial aqualtic life because the Cheow Lan Lake in the [[Rajjaprabha Dam]], part of Khao Sok National Park, is the last natural habitat in Thailand for this endangerous living fossil freshwater fish. In addition, this species of fish was first bred in Thailand in 1988 by the [[Department of Fisheries (Thailand)|Department of Fisheries]]. The hatchlings were from parents collected from the wild from nearby [[Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Saeng]] and [[Khlong Yan Wildlife Sanctuary|Khlong Yan Wildlife Sanctuaries]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Akkataweewat|first=Sompote|title=สาระน่ารู้ปลาน้ำจืดไทย เล่ม ๑|year=2004|publisher=Suksapanpanit|location=Bangkok|language=thai|isbn=974-00-8701-9|page=9–11}}</ref> 

The slogan of the province is "เมืองร้อยเกาะ เงาะอร่อย หอยใหญ่ ไข่แดง แหล่งธรรมะ" (''Mueang roi ko, ngo aroi, hoi yai, khai daeng, laeng thamma''), which translates to "city of 100 islands, delicious rambutan, big shells, red eggs, the center of Buddhism". This slogan reflects several unique aspects of the province: its numerous islands, the local specialty of tasty ''rambutan'' fruits, the abundance of large shellfish, notably [[oyster]]s, and the cultural significance of [[salted duck egg]]s known locally as "red eggs". The reference to the "center of Buddhism" highlights important religious sites within the province, including Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya and [[:th:สวนโมกขพลาราม|Suan Mokkhaphalaram]].

==Administrative divisions==

==Economy==
According to the 2008 census, Surat Thani Province recorded a [[Measures of national income and output|Gross Provincial Product]] (GPP) of 132,637.3 million baht (approximately US$4,019.31 million).{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}} The GPP per capita was reported to be 134,427 baht (around US$4,073.54). This marked an increase from the 2007 census, where the GPP was 122,398 million baht (US$3,599.94 million) and the GPP per capita was 125,651 baht (US$3,695.62). These figures indicate a GPP growth rate of 8.37 percent and a per capita growth rate of 6.98 percent.

Agriculture plays a significant role in Surat Thani's economy. The province is noted for its production of [[coconut]]s and rambutan. In the case of coconuts, they are often harvested by specially trained monkeys, predominantly [[southern pig-tailed macaque|pig-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca nemestrina''). The most renowned training center for these monkeys was established by the late [[Somporn Saekhow]]. Rambutan cultivation in Surat Thani traces its roots back to 1926, initiated by Chinese Malay Mr. K. Vong in the [[Ban Na San District]]. The province celebrates its rambutan production with an annual fair held in early August, featuring a parade of elaborately decorated floats on the Tapi River. Additionally, rubber tree plantations are widespread throughout Surat Thani, contributing to its agricultural output.

Surat Thani Province is renowned for its unique local products, notably the hand-woven silk cloth originating from the coastal village of Phum Riang in the [[Chaiya District]]. This district is also celebrated for producing red eggs, a regional delicacy. For this specialty, ducks are fed a diet of crabs and fish, and their eggs are subsequently preserved in a mixture of soil and salt, lending them a distinctive flavor and color.

Tourism plays a pivotal role in the economy of Surat Thani. In 2018, the province generated a significant revenue of 64 billion baht from tourism activities. This figure represented 63 percent of the total tourism income for Surat Thani, with a substantial portion attributable to its island destinations. These include popular tourist spots such as [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Pha Ngan]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park]], which are major contributors to the province's tourism sector. <ref>{{cite news |title=18km Samui bridge urged |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1849199/18km-samui-bridge-urged |access-date=3 February 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |date=3 February 2020}}</ref>
