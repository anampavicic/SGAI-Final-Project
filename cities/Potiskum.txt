[[File:Main market. jpg.jpg|thumb|Potiskum Main Market]]
Therefore, Potiskum is known for the following markets:

=== Potiskum Cattle Market ===
Potiskum is the largest city in Yobe State with booming business in the area. It has one of the largest cattle markets in Africa and the largest in [[West Africa]]. Most of the cattle are transported to other parts of the country.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Potiskum |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201412120201.html}}</ref>

== Potiskum airstrip ==
[[Potiskum Airstrip]] is located in city's GRA from the western part of the town along [[Kano (city)|Kano]] road. The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) office in the field, which is supposed to be responsible for the transmission of air traffic information to aircraft flying over the airfield, is not fully functional as the Omni-Directional Range Equipment installed there was not equipped with computers to enable the workers to spot planes over Potiskum. The airport came into being during the [[scramble for Africa]] by the colonialists because Potiskum was a sprawling town in the north which was earlier annexed by Germany before the United Kingdom took over. The aim of constructing the airport was to make the movements of the white men in and out of Potiskum easy because the town was also the gateway to other nearby towns in the north, which had enhanced trading activities and other associated commercial services in the region.

== Boko Haram attacks ==
