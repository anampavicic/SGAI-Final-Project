Its capital and largest city is [[Lanzhou]], in the southeast part of the province.

The seventh-largest administrative district by area at {{convert|453700|km2}}, Gansu lies between the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan]] and [[Loess Plateau|Loess]] plateaus and borders [[Mongolia]]'s [[Govi-Altai Province]], [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Ningxia]] to the north, [[Xinjiang]] and [[Qinghai]] to the west, [[Sichuan]] to the south and [[Shaanxi]] to the east. The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. Part of Gansu's territory is located in the [[Gobi Desert]]. The [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian mountains]] are located in the south of the Province.

Gansu has a population of 26&nbsp;million, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|22nd in China]]. Its population is mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], along with [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|ranking 31st]], last place, in GDP per capita as of 2019.

The [[state of Qin]] originated in what is now southeastern Gansu, and later established the first imperial dynasty in Chinese history. The [[Northern Silk Road]] ran through the [[Hexi Corridor]], which passes through Gansu, resulting in it being an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire.

The city of [[Jiayuguan City|Jiayuguan]], the second most populated city in Gansu, is known for its section of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and the [[Jiayu Pass|Jiayuguan Pass fortress complex]].

==Name==
Gansu is a compound of the names of [[Ganzhou District|Gānzhou]] (now the main [[district (PRC)|urban district]] and [[administrative seat|seat]] of [[Zhangye]]) and [[Suzhou District|Sùzhou]] (an old name and the modern seat of [[Jiuquan]]), formerly the two most important Chinese settlements in the [[Hexi Corridor]].

Gansu is abbreviated as "{{linktext|lang=zh|甘}}" ({{transliteration|zh|Gān}}) or "{{linktext|lang=zh-hans|陇}}" ({{transliteration|zh|Lǒng}}), and was also known as '''[[Longxi Commandery|Longxi]]''' ({{zh|labels=no |s=陇西 |l="[land] west of Long"}}) or '''Longyou''' ({{zh|labels=no |s=陇右 |l="[land] right of Long"}}) prior to early [[Western Han dynasty]], in reference to the [[Mount Liupan|Long Mountain]] (the modern day [[Mount Liupan|Liupan Mountain]]'s southern section) between eastern Gansu and western [[Shaanxi]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Until 1987, Gansu was rendered in the [[Chinese postal romanization|postal romanization]] and [[Wade-Giles]] as '''Kansu''', which gradually replaced by pinyin starting in 1958.<ref>{{cite news|title=陕西为什么拼作Shaanxi，而不是Shanxi |work=澎湃新闻|date=2016-07-07|url=https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1495089}}</ref> The spelling of the province is also spelled in [[Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II]] (1986) and [[Tongyong Pinyin]] (2002) adopted by the [[Government of the Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], who would later adopt Hanyu Pinyin in 2009.

== History ==
[[File:Summer Vacation 2007, 263, Watchtower In The Morning Light, Dunhuang, Gansu Province.jpg|thumb|250px|The ruins of a [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) Chinese [[watchtower]] made of [[rammed earth]] at [[Dunhuang]], Gansu province, the eastern edge of the [[Silk Road]]]]

Gansu's name is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound name]] first used during the [[Song dynasty]]. It is a combination of the names of two prefectures ({{lang|zh|州}}) in the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty]]: Gan (around [[Zhangye]]) and Su (around [[Jiuquan]]). Its eastern part forms part of one of the cradles of ancient Chinese civilisation.

=== Ancient Gansu ===
In prehistoric times, Gansu was host to [[Neolithic]] cultures. The [[Dadiwan culture]], from where archaeologically significant [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s have been excavated, flourished in the eastern end of Gansu from about 6000{{nbsp}}BC to about 3000{{nbsp}}BC.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/2002/Nov/48266.htm Dadiwan Relics Break Archeological Records]</ref> The [[Majiayao culture]] and part of the [[Qijia culture]] took root in Gansu from 3100 BC to 2700 BC and 2400 BC to 1900 BC respectively.

The [[Yuezhi]] originally lived in the very western part of Gansu until they were forced to emigrate by the [[Xiongnu]] around 177 BC.

The [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]], known in China as the [[Qin dynasty|founding state]] of the [[Early Imperial China|Chinese empire]], grew out from the southeastern part of Gansu, specifically the [[Tianshui]] area. The Qin name is believed to have originated, in part, from the area.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-11/19/content_5349258.htm Xinhua – English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305230318/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-11/19/content_5349258.htm |date=5 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/200602/20/eng20060220_244270.html |title=People's Daily Online – Chinese surname history: Qin |access-date=22 February 2016 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192740/http://en.people.cn/200602/20/eng20060220_244270.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Qin tombs and artifacts have been excavated from [[Fangmatan]] near Tianshui, including one 2200-year-old map of [[Guixian County]].<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-04/30/content_378835.htm Over 2,200-Year-old Map Discovered in NW China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312011236/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-04/30/content_378835.htm |date=12 March 2007 }}</ref>

===Imperial era===
[[File:Chinese jar, Neolithic period, painted earthenware, HAA.JPG|thumb|left|[[Xindian culture]] era jar with two lug handles uncovered in Gansu, dating to around 1,000 BC]] [[File:Yumenguan.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The ruins of a gate at [[Yumen Pass]], built during the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)]]]]
In imperial times, Gansu was an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire, as the [[Hexi Corridor]] runs along the "neck" of the province. The [[Han dynasty]] extended the [[History of the Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] across this corridor, building the strategic [[Yumenguan]] (Jade Gate Pass, near [[Dunhuang]]) and [[Yangguan]] fort towns along it. Remains of the wall and the towns can be found there. The [[Ming dynasty]] built the [[Jiayuguan (pass)|Jiayuguan]] outpost in Gansu. To the west of Yumenguan and the [[Qilian Mountains]], at the northwestern end of the province, the [[Yuezhi]], [[Wusun]], and other [[nomad]]ic tribes dwelt ([[Shiji]] 123), occasionally figuring in regional imperial Chinese [[geopolitics]].

By the Qingshui treaty, concluded in 823 between the [[Tibetan Empire]] and the Tang dynasty, China lost much of western Gansu province for a significant period.<ref>Turghun Almas, "Uygurlar", Kashgar, 1989.</ref>

After the fall of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]], a Buddhist [[Yugur people|Yugur]] (Uyghur) state called the [[Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom]] was established by migrating Uyghurs from the khaganate in part of Gansu that lasted from 848 to 1036{{nbsp}}AD.

Along the [[Silk Road]], Gansu was an economically important province, as well as a cultural transmission path. Temples and [[Buddhist]] [[grotto]]es<ref>[http://en.people.cn/200201/03/eng20020103_87985.shtml English.people.com.cn]</ref> such as those at [[Mogao Caves]] ('Caves of the Thousand Buddhas') and [[Maijishan Caves]] contain artistically and historically revealing [[mural]]s.<ref>"Artistic treasures of Maiji Mountain caves" by Alok Shrotriya and Zhou Xue-ying. [http://www.asianart.com/articles/alok/index.html Asianart.com]</ref> An early form of paper inscribed with [[Chinese writing|Chinese characters]] and dating to about 8{{nbsp}}BC was discovered at the site of a Western Han [[garrison]] near the Yumen pass in August 2006.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080328142706/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/08/content_4937457.htm Xinhuanet.com ]</ref>

The Xixia or [[Western Xia]] dynasty controlled much of Gansu as well as [[Ningxia]].

The province was also the origin of the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]] of 1862–77. Among the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] forces were Muslim generals, including [[Ma Zhan'ao]] and [[Ma Anliang]], who helped the Qing crush the rebel Muslims. The revolt had spread into Gansu from neighbouring Qinghai.

There was another [[Dungan revolt (1895–1896)|Dungan revolt from 1895 to 1896]].

===Republican China===
As a result of frequent earthquakes, droughts and famines, the economic progress of Gansu was significantly slower than that of other provinces of China until recently. Based on the area's abundant mineral resources it has begun developing into a vital industrial center. An [[1920 Haiyuan earthquake|earthquake in Gansu]] at 8.6 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] killed around 180,000 people mostly in the present-day area of [[Ningxia]] in 1920, and [[1932 Changma earthquake|another with a magnitude of 7.6]] killed 275 in 1932.<ref name="NGDC">{{cite web|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-more-info/3507|title=Significant Earthquake Information|last=National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): NCEI/WDS Global Significant Earthquake Database.

The [[Muslim Conflict in Gansu (1927–1930)]] was a conflict against the [[Guominjun]].

While the Muslim General [[Ma Hongbin]] was acting chairman of the province, Muslim General [[Ma Buqing]] was in virtual control of Gansu in 1940. Liangzhou District in [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]] was previously his headquarters in Gansu, where he controlled 15&nbsp;million Muslims.<ref>{{cite news |title=Moslem War Lord Isolated by China; Ma Pu-ching Sent to Swamps of Tibet With the Title of Reclamation Commissioner Member of a Noted Clan Vital Route to Russia Passes Through Area With 15,000,000 Believers in the Koran|author=Harrison Forman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 July 1942|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E5DF1E3EE531A1575AC1A9619C946393D6CF}}</ref> [[Xinjiang]] came under [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalist) control after their soldiers entered via Gansu.<ref name="Lin2010">{{cite book|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8YtCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|date=13 September 2010|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-92393-7|pages=76–}}</ref> Gansu's [[Tianshui|Tienshui]] was the site of a Japanese-Chinese warplane fight.<ref name="Armstrong2006">{{cite book|author=Alan Armstrong|title=Preemptive Strike: The Secret Plan that Would Have Prevented the Attack on Pearl Harbor|url=https://archive.org/details/preemptivestrike00alan|url-access=registration|quote=airfield kansu.|year=2006|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-1-59228-913-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/preemptivestrike00alan/page/122 122]–}}</ref>

The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. The province contains the [[geographical centre]] of China, marked by the Center of the Country Monument at {{coord|35|50|40.9|N|103|27|7.5|E|region:CN-62_type:landmark|name=Geographical centre of China}}.<ref>[http://en.people.cn/english/200009/13/eng20000913_50419.html English.people.com.cn]</ref>

Part of the [[Gobi Desert]] is located in Gansu, as well as small parts of the [[Badain Jaran Desert]] and the [[Tengger Desert]].

The [[Yellow River]] gets most of its water from Gansu, flowing straight through Lanzhou. The area around Wuwei is part of [[Shiyang River Basin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurewater.nl/gmep/shiyang/general |access-date=15 June 2009 |author=FutureWater |title=Groundwater Management Exploration Package |location=# [[Wageningen]], Netherlands |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152308/http://www.futurewater.nl/gmep/shiyang/general |archive-date=24 July 2011 }}</ref>

The landscape in Gansu is very mountainous in the south and flat in the north. The mountains in the south are part of the [[Qilian Mountains]], while the far western [[Altyn-Tagh]] contains the province's highest point, at {{convert|5830|m|ft|-1}}.

A natural land passage known as [[Hexi Corridor]], stretching some {{convert|1000|km}} from Lanzhou to the [[Yumen Pass|Jade Gate]], is situated within the province. It is bound from north by the Gobi Desert and Qilian Mountains from the south.

Gansu generally has a semi-arid to arid continental climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'' or ''BWk'') with warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters, although [[diurnal temperature range]]s are often so large that maxima remain above {{convert|0|C|F}} even in winter.  However, due to extreme altitude, some areas of Gansu exhibit a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dwc'') – with winter temperatures sometimes dropping to {{convert|-40|C|F}}. Most of the limited precipitation is delivered in the summer months: winters are so dry that snow cover is confined to very high altitudes and the [[snow line]] can be as high as {{convert|5500|m|ft|-1}} in the southwest.

== Economy ==
Despite recent growth in Gansu and the booming economy in the rest of China, Gansu is still considered to be one of the poorest provinces in China. For several years, it has [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|ranked as one of the provinces with lowest GDP per capita]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=解读甘肃经济指标：最难堪的数字 越来越实的数字_共话陇原|url=http://www.gs.xinhuanet.com/ghly/temp2018/tj01/index.htm|access-date=2021-04-05|website=www.gs.xinhuanet.com|archive-date=19 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210919210039/http://www.gs.xinhuanet.com/ghly/temp2018/tj01/index.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its nominal GDP for 2017 was about 767.7&nbsp;billion yuan (US$113.70&nbsp;billion) and per capita of 29,326&nbsp;RMB (US$4,343).

===Jiayuguan Pass of the Great Wall===
{{main|Jiayuguan Pass}}
Jiayuguan Pass, in Jiayuguan city, is the largest and most intact pass, or entrance, of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. Jiayuguan Pass was built in the early [[Ming dynasty]], somewhere around the year 1372. It was built near an oasis that was then on the extreme western edge of China. Jiayuguan Pass was the first pass on the west end of the great wall so it earned the name "The First And Greatest Pass Under Heaven".

An extra brick is said to rest on a ledge over one of the gates.  One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration.  Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.  When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.<ref name="CNTOLEGEND">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnto.org/iconic/the-great-wall-in-gansu/|title=The Great Wall in Gansu|access-date=4 December 2015|archive-date=8 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208114550/http://www.cnto.org/iconic/the-great-wall-in-gansu/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Mogao Grottoes===
{{main|Mogao Caves}}
The Mogao Grottoes near [[Dunhuang]] have a collection of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] art. Originally there were a thousand grottoes, but now only 492 cave temples remain. Each temple has a large statue of a [[Buddha (general)|buddha]] or [[bodhisattva]] and paintings of religious scenes. In 366&nbsp;AD under the [[Former Liang|Former Liang dynasty]], a monk named Le Zun (Lo-tsun) came near Echoing Sand Mountain, when he had a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]].

[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 156.jpg|thumb|200px|A terracotta warrior from Gansu, with traces of polychrome and gold, from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907)]]
The historic [[Silk Road]] starts in [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) and goes to [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul). On the way merchants would go to Dunhuang in Gansu. In Dunhuang they would get fresh camels, food and guards for the journey around the dangerous [[Taklamakan Desert]]. Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [[Kashgar|Kashi (Kashgar)]], was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their [[Bactrian camel]]s for [[Dromedary|single humped]] ones. After Kashi they would keep going until they reached their next destination.

Located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the city, the [[Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)|Crescent Lake]] or Yueyaquan is an oasis and popular spot for tourists seeking respite from the heat of the desert. Activities includes camel and 4x4 rides.

Among Gansu's most important sources of energy are its water resources: the Yellow River and other inland river drainage basins. Gansu is placed ninth among China's provinces in annual hydropower potential and water discharge. Gansu produces 17.24 gigawatts of hydropower a year. Twenty-nine hydropower stations have been constructed in Gansu, capable of generating 30 gigawatts in total. Gansu has an estimated coal reserve of 8.92&nbsp;billion tons and [[Oil reserves|petroleum reserve]] of 700&nbsp;million tons.

There is also good potential for wind and solar power development. The [[Gansu Wind Farm]] project – already producing 7.965GW in 2015<ref name="busitza">{{cite web|title=South Africa's biggest wind farms vs the world|url=https://businesstech.co.za/news/energy/93743/south-africas-biggest-wind-farms-vs-the-world/|publisher=BusinessTech|access-date=22 November 2016|date=22 July 2015}}</ref> – is expected to achieve 20GW by 2020, at which time it will likely become the world's biggest collective windfarm.

In November 2017 an agreement between the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and Gansu government was announced, to site and begin operations of a [[molten salt reactor]] pilot project in the province by 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cas.cn/yw/201711/t20171110_4621454.shtml |script-title=zh:中科院与甘肃省签署钍基熔盐堆核能系统项目战略合作框架协议----中国科学院 |publisher=[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] |date=10 November 2017 |language=zh |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113083737/http://www.cas.cn/yw/201711/t20171110_4621454.shtml |archive-date=13 November 2017 |access-date=13 September 2021}}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
Gansu has 659 species of wild animals.<ref>[http://www.gansu.gov.cn/en/BasicDetail.asp?CID=50 Gansu.gov.cn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115095308/http://www.gansu.gov.cn/en/BasicDetail.asp?CID=50 |date=15 November 2009 }}</ref> It has twenty-four rare animals which are under a state protection.

Gansu's mammals include some of the world's most charismatic: the [[giant panda]], [[golden monkey]]s, [[lynx]], [[snow leopard]]s, [[sika deer]], [[musk deer]], and the [[Bactrian camel]].

Among zoologists who study [[Mole (animal)|mole]]s, the [[Gansu mole]] is of great interest.  For a reason that can only be speculated, it is taxologically a [[Scalopini|New World mole]] living among [[Talpinae|Old World moles]]: that is to say, an American mole living in a sea of Euro-Asians.

Gansu is home to 441 [[species]] of [[bird]]s; it is a center of [[endemism]] and home to many species and [[subspecies]] which occur nowhere else in the world.

Gansu is China's second-largest producer of medicinal plants and herbs, including some produced nowhere else, such as the [[hairy asiabell]] root, [[Fritillaria|fritillary]] bulb, and [[Chinese caterpillar fungus]].
