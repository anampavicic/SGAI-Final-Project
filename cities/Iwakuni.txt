== History ==
[[Image:IwakuniCastle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Iwakuni Castle]]]]
The area of present-day Iwakuni was part of the ancient [[Suō Province]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], it was part of the holdings of the [[Mōri clan]]: however, after the defeat of the Western Army at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, the area around Iwakuni was granted to warlord [[Kikkawa Hiroie]] for his role in keeping the Mōri army from participating in the battle and thus preventing the complete [[attainder]] of the Mōri holdings under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].  The [[Kikkawa clan]] built [[Iwakuni Castle]] and the core of the modern city developed from the [[jōkamachi|castle town]] which arose around its ramparts. [[Iwakuni Domain]] had a ''[[kokudaka]]'' of 60,000 ''[[koku]]'', but was regarded as a semi-independent component of [[Chōshū Domain]] until the [[Meiji restoration]].<ref name="mothra.rerf.or.jp">Mothra.

== Local attractions ==
Tourists from both Japan and overseas who visit [[Hiroshima, Hiroshima|Hiroshima]] and [[Itsukushima Shrine|Miyajima]] often extend their travels to include Iwakuni.

=== Kintai Bridge ===
[[File:Iwakuni Kintaikyo.jpg|thumb|right|Kintai Bridge, or Kintaikyō.]]
The famous [[Kintai Bridge]] (Kintai-kyō) is the city's most popular sightseeing spot. The Kintai Bridge spans the [[Nishiki River]] and was first constructed in 1673 by Hiroyoshi Kikkawa.  The bridge stood until September 14, 1950, when it was destroyed by the typhoon “Kijiya”.<ref>Rescuers Seek Missing in Typhoon’s Aftermath (2005, September 12). Yomiuri Shinbun, p. 2. Retrieved January 11, 2009, from Lexis Nexis Academic database.</ref> The bridge began being rebuilt only a week later and was completed in 1953. It was a recreation of the original and was built using traditional techniques. Since the first reconstruction, the Kintai Bridge has undergone some renovation. The latest renovation was completed in 2004.<ref>The Bridge Between Japan and the World. (2005). Kintai-kyo Bridge. Retrieved January 10, 2009 from http://www.geocities.jp/general_sasaki/kintaikyo-eng.html</ref> Its five arches are a symbol of western Honshū. The Kintai Bridge is about 20 minutes from Iwakuni Station by bus and about 15 minutes from Shin-Iwakuni Station of Sanyo-Shinkansen. Several buses provide service from Iwakuni and Shin-Iwakuni Station to the Kintai Bridge every day.

=== Kikko Park ===
Kikko Park is located on the other side of the Kintai Bridge. This area used to be the residence of the Kikkawa family.<ref name="city.iwakuni.yamaguchi.jp"/> The park has a big fountain and contains numerous shops as well as a variety of flowers.  Kikko Park is also home to a sanctuary for white snakes. These [[snakes]] are found only in Iwakuni, and have been designated as special national treasures by the Japanese government. The white snake is a symbol of [[Benten]], the Japanese goddess of wealth. The white snake is considered a sign of good luck in Japan. Many people come to pray to the snakes so that they might be successful in their businesses.<ref name="city.iwakuni.yamaguchi.jp"/>

=== Imazu White Snake Museum ===
In Japanese folklore{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}, if a white snake is found in your home it is said to bring good fortune. The white snakes found in Iwakuni are usually the albino variety of the [[Japanese Rat Snake]]. They are gentle ivory white snakes with ruby colored eyes which can only{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} be found in concentration at Iwakuni. There is a viewing facility near Kikko Park.

The castle was originally constructed in 1608 by Hiroie Kikkawa, but was destroyed only seven years later.<ref>Yamaguchi; Guide Paves way to Castle’s Old Wall (2008, October 4). Yomiuri Shinbun,
p. 15. Retrieved January 11, 2009, from Lexis Nexis Academic database.</ref> It was reconstructed in 1962. Iwakuni Castle is situated at the top of Mount Shiroyama, and can be reached on foot or by cable car. The castle includes a history museum containing armor, weapons, and other artifacts of the Kikkawa family.<ref name="city.iwakuni.yamaguchi.jp"/> From atop of the castle, there is an impressive view of Iwakuni. The castle area also offers several trails for hiking and exercise.

=== Cormorant fishing ===
On the Nishiki river, traditional [[cormorant]] fishing can be seen in the summertime. Fishermen wearing traditional clothing such as the noble's headgear called “kazaore eboshi”, aprons, straw skirts, and straw sandals, perform this more-than-300-year-old fishing technique. The fishermen control the cormorant, making them catch a fish, which is then retrieved from the cormorant's mouth by the fisherman.<ref name="mothra.rerf.or.jp"/> Also, in early spring, the sight of cherry blossoms along the Nishiki river is unforgettable.

=== Other places ===
The Mekata Residence was the home of a mid-ranking samurai family from the 18th century. It is one of the last few remaining and so it is considered national property.

The Momijidani Maple Park used to be the garden of a temple. Located near the beginning of a mountain trail, many visitors come each autumn to view the colorful leaves on the many maple trees here.

The Nagayamon Gate of the Kagawa Family Residence is another well preserved piece of history. The appearance of this samurai residence has also been well kept and is considered prefectural cultural property.

The Iwakuni Art Museum contains ceramics, armor, furniture, and other artifacts which were once used by feudal lords.

Iwakuni also offers several different kinds of plants and trees which people like to view. In addition to the cherry trees and maple trees along the Nishiki river, there are also Japanese apricot trees, peony bushes, azalea, Japanese iris, and hydrangea. Many of these plants and trees are located around Kikko Park.<ref name="city.iwakuni.yamaguchi.jp"/>

=== Festivals ===
The Kintai Bridge Festival is held annually on April 29 at Kikko Park. The festival includes a parade across the bridge called the “Sankin-koutai” Feudal Lords’ Procession featuring locals dressed in historic [[samurai]] costumes. The date of this festival is subject to some controversy as it is former emperor Hirohito's birthday. From the death of Hirohito in 1989 until 2005, the day was officially called “Greenery Day”.  In 2005, it was voted to change the name to “Showa Day” in reference to Hirohito despite the fear of opposition from other countries such as China and [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], against which war crimes were committed under the direction of the late emperor. However, according to the Liberal Democratic Party, this day would “encourage public reflection of the turbulent 63 years of Hirohito's reign, rather than glorify the emperor himself”.<ref>Japan Names Day After Hirohito. (2005, May 14). BBC News. Retrieved January 10, 2009, from http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4543461.stm</ref>

The Nishiki River Water Festival is held on the first Saturday of every August. There is a large fireworks display and many people attend dressed in traditional clothing such as kimono.

== Cuisine ==
Visitors to Iwakuni may also wish to sample the town's special local version of [[sushi]], which is made in a square mold. What is unique about this sushi is that it is prepared in large amounts, generally enough to feed about 150 people. There are also many "sushi-go-rounds" where sushi makes its way around the restaurant for patrons to pick and choose from via a moving belt.<ref name="city.iwakuni.yamaguchi.jp"/>

Iwakuni is famous for fresh [[Nelumbo nucifera#Human consumption|lotus roots]] which many people enjoy. Lotus roots grown in Iwakuni typically have nine holes, as opposed to lotus roots grown elsewhere, which typically have eight holes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=crou1551ton |title=Iwakuni Renkon Lotus Root {{!}} {{!}} IWAKUNI |url=http://kankou.iwakuni-city.net/itn/iwakuni-lotus-root |access-date=2022-09-18 |language=en-US}}</ref> These are cooked in different ways such as sautéed, simmered, or deep-fried.

Iwakuni {{ill|Chagayu|ja|茶粥}} is a tea-flavored rice porridge originally created about 400 years ago by Hiroie Kikkawa as an inexpensive means of providing food for his subordinates. The tea which was originally used to flavor the chagayu is called “bancha”.<ref>Oidemase. (2007). Iwakuni-chagayu.

There has been a [[MCAS Iwakuni|military airfield at Iwakuni]] since the 1930s. The area was all farmland and villages until the Japanese government bought a large portion of it in 1938, with the view of establishing a naval air station. The new base was officially commissioned on July 8, 1940. When World War II started, the Iwakuni air station was used as a training and defense base. The station housed 96 trainers and 150 Zero fighter planes on the airstrip. In September 1943, a branch of the Etajima Naval Academy was established here, with approximately 1,000 cadets undergoing training in the Basic, Junior and Senior Officer's schools at any one time.<ref>[http://community.marines.mil/unit/mcasiwakuni/Pages/history.aspx] (December 12, 2012</ref>
After World War II, the base was occupied by units of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan.

Then in 1952, the base officially became an air station of the [[United States Marine Corps]].<ref>MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. (n.d.). MCAS Iwakuni History. Retrieved January 11, 2009,
