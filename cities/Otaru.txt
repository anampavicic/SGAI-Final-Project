{{nihongo|'''Otaru'''|小樽市|Otaru-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] and [[Seaports of Japan|port]] in [[Shiribeshi Subprefecture]], [[Hokkaido]], Japan, northwest of [[Sapporo]]. The city faces [[Ishikari Bay]] and the [[Sea of Japan]], and has long served as the main port of the bay. With its many historical buildings, Otaru is a popular tourist destination. Because it is a 25-minute drive from Sapporo, it has grown as a [[commuter town]]. As of July 31, 2023, the city had an estimated population of 107,432 and a population density of 441 persons per km² (1,100 persons per mi²). The total area is {{convert|243.83|km2|abbr=on}}. Although it is the largest city in [[Shiribeshi Subprefecture]], the subprefecture's capital is the more centrally located [[Kutchan, Hokkaido|Kutchan]].

== History ==
The name "Otaru" is recognized as being of [[Ainu people|Ainu]] origin, possibly meaning "River running through the sandy beach". The very small remaining part of the Temiya Cave contains carvings from the Zoku-Jōmon period of Ainu history, around A.D.&nbsp;400. Mount Akaiwa (Northwest part of Otaru) is memorialized in the Ainu tradition in the story of [[Sitonai]], village chief's teenage daughter who had slain a white snake from the mountain's cave that demanded sacrifices of girls every year.<ref>{{cite web|last=metasato|title=小樽 大蛇を殺した娘|url=http://ryujin.metasato.com/|access-date=October 31, 2020|website=虫の知らせ ― 北海道の雨乞い、龍神信仰リサーチ ―|language=ja}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=白龍権現|url=http://baseball4.info/hakuryu.html|access-date=October 31, 2020|language=ja}}</ref> The legend explains the name of a big cave on Mount Akaiwa, Hakuryu Gongen Cave (白竜権現洞窟, lit. "White Dragon [[Gongen]] Cave") and the reason why a shrine was built on the mountain (to protect the village from being haunted by the snake).<ref name=":0" />

Otaru was recognised as a village by the ''[[bakufu]]'' in 1865, and in 1880 the first railway line in Hokkaido was opened with daily service between Otaru and Sapporo.

An Imperial decree in July 1899 established Otaru as an open port for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref>US Department of State. (1906). [https://archive.org/details/digestofinternat01mooriala/page/759 ''A digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties, and other international agreements'' (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759].</ref>

The city flourished well as the financial and business center in Hokkaido as well as the trade port with Japanese ruled southern Sakhalin until the 1920s. Otaru was redesignated as a city on August 1, 1922.

On December 27, 1924, a freight train loaded with 600 cases of dynamite, unloaded from the freighter ''Shoho Maru'',<ref>"SCORES KILLED IN POWDER BLAST— Hundreds of Homes Razed by Explosion", United Press report in ''Lincoln (NE) Sunday Star'', December 28, 1924 p.1</ref> exploded in Temiya Station, killing 94 people and injuring 200 more, in addition to damaging the warehouse, the harbour facilities, and the surrounding area.<ref>"Powder Cargo Explodes and Fire Follows—  Several Hundred Casualties Are Reported In Disaster To Japanese Ship", ''Ottawa Journal'', December 27, 1924, p.1</ref>

During [[World War II]], Otaru housed a prison camp for [[Aleuts]] taken there following the [[Japanese occupation of Attu]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Breu|first=Mary|title=Last Letters from Attu: The True Story of Etta Jones, Alaska Pioneer and Japanese POW|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubTCCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT296|year=2009|publisher=Graphic Arts Books|location=Portland|isbn=978-0-88240-852-1|page=296}}</ref> During the closing stages of the war, Otaru was [[Air raids on Japan#Naval air attacks|bombed by American naval aircraft]] in July 1945.<ref name="Asahi Shimbun">{{cite web|last=[[The Asahi Shimbun]]|title=朝日新聞デジタル：空襲の記憶 風化させぬ - 北海道 - 地域|url=http://www.asahi.com/area/hokkaido/articles/MTW20151209011470014.html|access-date=2022-04-13|website=www.asahi.com|language=ja|archive-date=14 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414064109/http://www.asahi.com/area/hokkaido/articles/MTW20151209011470014.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the 1950s, as the coal industry around the city went into a decline, the status of the economic hub shifted from Otaru to Sapporo.

== Geography ==
{{Wide image|1 otaru aerial panorama 2015.jpg|800px|An aerial panoramic view of the town from above the Sea of Japan}}
Otaru is a [[port town]] on the coast of the [[Sea of Japan]] in northern [[Shiribeshi Subprefecture]]. The southern portion of the city is characterized by the steep slopes of various mountains (notably Tenguyama), where the altitude of the land sharply drops from the mountains to the sea. The land available between the coast and mountains has been almost completely developed, and the developed part of the city on the mountain slopes is called ''Saka-no-machi'', or "Hill town", including hills named ''Funamizaka'' (Boat-view Hill) and ''Jigokuzaka'' (Hell Hill).

[[File:Otaru Canal03bs3.jpg|thumb|A view of Otaru Canal]]
A canal adorned with [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-style]] street lamps runs through Otaru. The city attracts a large number of Japanese tourists as well as Chinese, Korean and others.

A popular attraction on the west side of the city is Nishin Goten ([[herring]] mansion). This large wooden building was built in 1897 and was once the house of Fukumatsu Tanaka, a magnate of the fishing industry. It was originally built in nearby Tomari village and moved in 1958. Visitors can clearly see the difference between the squalid conditions of the first floor sleeping quarters of 120 workers and the ground floor luxury of the magnate's rooms.

Another notable building is the Sakaushi residence, constructed by [[Yoshiya Tanoue]], a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otaru-works.com/|title=Npo 小樽ワークス|access-date=November 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104002724/http://www.otaru-works.com/|archive-date=November 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=小樽市指定歴史的建造物 第７４号 坂牛邸 {{!}} 小樽市 |url=https://www.city.otaru.lg.jp/docs/2020101500986/|access-date=2023-04-20|website=www.city.otaru.lg.jp|language=ja}}</ref>

It is home to the [[Otaru Aquarium]] and has long been one of Otaru's most popular tourist attractions. Otaru Aquarium, recognized by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology as a facility equivalent to a museum under the Museum Law, is the oldest existing aquarium in Hokkaido, having opened in 1958.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://museum.bunka.go.jp/guide/ |title=法律上の位置付けがある登録博物館・指定施設 |date=2024-02-27 |publisher=文化庁}}</ref><ref>『市営』として発足 祝津の水族館準備すすむ - 北海道新聞1959年1月22日朝刊</ref>

The Tomioka Catholic church is also a popular spot. Many of the buildings have been designated as landmark architecture.<ref>{{cite web|title=小樽市指定歴史的建造物 第７０号 カトリック富岡教会 {{!}} 小樽市|url=https://www.city.otaru.lg.jp/docs/2020101500948/|access-date=2023-04-20|website=www.city.otaru.lg.jp|language=ja}}</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2018}}

Otaru is well known for its beer, and Otaru Beer, next to the canal, is a popular restaurant with a medieval theme. Otaru is also known for its fresh [[sushi]]. Another food attraction unique to Otaru is the rainbow tower ice cream. The town also has substantial shopping arcades and bazaars, but fewer than nearby [[Sapporo]].

Otaru's prominent industries are [[handicraft|arts and crafts]], such as [[studio glass]] and [[musical box]]es. Of the latter, it maintains the [[Otaru Music Box Museum]]. [[Otaru Art Base]] is another cluster of museums that showcases local art.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Where Art Meets Historical Architecture: Otaru Art Base |url=https://en.visit-hokkaido.jp/destinations/where-art-meets-historical-architecture-otaru-art-base |access-date=2024-06-06 |website=HOKKAIDO LOVE! |language=en}}</ref>[[File:Otaru Tengu-yama ski resort View.JPG|thumb|Otaru Tenguyama Ski Resort]]
== Tenguyama ==
Otaru is an important port for Sapporo, and part of this hilly city is on the lower slopes of Tenguyama, a good place for skiing and other winter sports and one that is accessible via [[Otaru Tenguyama Ropeway]].

== Regional dishes ==
[[Otaru Ankake Yakisoba]] is a regional variety of the popular Ankake [[Yakisoba]] dish that is an important part of the local cuisine and is a draw for tourists.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yonebayashi |first=Chiharu |title=Rurubu Sapporo Otaru Furano Asahiyama Zoo '14 |date=29 January 2011 |publisher=JTB Publishing |isbn=978-4-533-08994-7 |editor-last=Yamamoto |editor-first=Yusuke}}</ref>
