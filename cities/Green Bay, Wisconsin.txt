==History==

[[Samuel de Champlain]], the founder of [[New France]], commissioned [[Jean Nicolet]] to form a peaceful alliance with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the western areas, whose unrest interfered with the French fur trade, and to search for a shorter trade route to China through Canada. Nicolet and others had learned from other First Nations of the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago) people, who identified as "People of the Sea", and believed they must reside on or near an Ocean.<ref>[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2330&keyword=nicolet "Jean Nicolet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611162859/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2330&keyword=nicolet |date=June 11, 2011 }}, Wisconsin History</ref> Champlain had also heard about natural resources in the area, including fertile soil, forests, and animals. Nicolet began his journey for this new land shortly before winter in 1634.<ref name="autogenerated1">City of Green Bay. "City of Green Bay." www.ci.green-bay.wi.us.

He is believed to have landed at Red Banks, near the site of the modern-day city of Green Bay, Wisconsin.<ref>[http://www.enchantedlearning.com/explorers/page/n/nicollet.shtml "Jean Nicolet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925083418/http://www.enchantedlearning.com/explorers/page/n/nicollet.shtml |date=September 25, 2011 }}, Enchanted Learning</ref>

=== From the trading post ''La Baie des Puants'' to the town ''La Baie verte'' ===

Nicolet founded a small trading post here in 1634, originally named ''La Baye'' or ''La Baie des Puants'' (French for "the Bay of Stinking Waters").<ref name="Nicolet">{{cite web |title=Green Bay History: 1600-1700s |url=http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/history/1600s_1700s.html |publisher=City of Green Bay |access-date=August 23, 2017 |archive-date=September 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901223927/http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/history/1600s_1700s.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Nicolet's settlement was one of the oldest European permanent settlements in America.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSwdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1|title=Historic Green Bay. 1634-1840|last1=Neville|first1=Ella Hoes|last2=Martin|first2=Sarah Greene|last3=Martin|first3=Deborah Beaumont|date=1893|publisher=The Authors|access-date=October 17, 2020|archive-date=August 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818104943/https://books.google.com/books?id=MSwdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1|url-status=live}}</ref>

When Nicolet arrived in the Green Bay area, he encountered the [[Menominee]], who occupied this territory. He also met the [[Ho-Chunk]] (also known as the Winnebago), a people who spoke a [[Sioux|Siouan]] language.

The Winnebago hunted and fished, and also cultivated corn, beans, squash, and tobacco. [[Wild rice]], which they had incorporated as a dietary staple, grew in abundance along the riverbanks. The women regularly harvested and cooked this, along with a wide variety of nuts, berries, and edible roots which they gathered in the woods.<ref name="City of Green Bay">[http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html City of Green Bay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213154730/http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html |date=February 13, 2009|access-date=September 9, 2017 }}</ref> The men typically hunted and fished for food, and the women processed game and other foods in cooking. They prepared and made clothing from the furs, as well as using other parts of animals to make tools, cord, etc. Women also had a role in the political process, as no action could be taken without agreement of half of the women. Nicolet stayed with this tribe for about a year, becoming an ally. He helped open up opportunities for trade and commerce with them before returning to Quebec.<ref name="City of Green Bay" />

A few months after Nicolet returned to Quebec, Champlain died. His death halted other journeys to ''La Baie Verte'' (French for "The Green Bay"). Père [[Claude Allouez]] sent [[Nicolas Perrot]] to La Baie. After this, the French avoided the area for some decades, because of the intensity of First Nations and European conflicts in the east. In 1671, a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Mission was set up in the area. A fort was added in 1717 and gradually associated development took place. The town was incorporated in 1754.

Great Britain took control of some French areas during the [[Seven Years' War]], known as the [[French and Indian War]] in some areas of North America. They took control of this town in 1761. After the British defeated the French in 1763, France ceded its lands east of the Mississippi in North America.

The first permanent settlers were [[Charles de Langlade]] and his family from Quebec, who moved to Green Bay in 1765. They are considered the first European settlers in the present-day state of Wisconsin. Langlade, called the "Founder and Father of Wisconsin", was a ''[[métis]]'' or mixed-race, son of a French-Canadian father and an [[Ottawa]] woman. He grew up with his mother's family among the Ottawa people and became a war chief. The Ottawa were allies of the French during the [[French and Indian War]], and Langlade is credited with planning the ambush of British [[Edward Braddock|General Braddock]] and [[George Washington]]. His family was followed to Green Bay by the Grignons, Porliers and Lawes, who brought French-Canadian culture with them. Colorful "jack-knife Judge" Reaume dispensed British justice in the territory after Great Britain took it over following the war.<ref name="City of Green Bay"/> These early ethnic French settlers set the tone for many who followed.

=== The British takeover ===

[[File:Tank Cottage Heritage Hill June 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Built in 1776 by French-Canadian [[Voyageurs|voyageur]] Joseph Roi, the [[Tank Cottage]] is the [[List of the oldest buildings in Wisconsin|oldest standing building]] from the state's early years.

The British gradually took over Wisconsin during the [[French and Indian War]], taking control of Green Bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of Wisconsin in 1763. Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. The first permanent settlers, mostly [[French Canadian]]s, some Anglo-New Englanders and a few African American freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. [[Charles Michel de Langlade]] is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=langlade |website=www.wisconsinhistory.org |access-date=15 January 2022 |title=Term: Langlade, Charles Michel 1729 - 1801 |archive-date=December 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211022113/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=langlade |url-status=dead }}</ref> Settlement began at Prairie du Chien around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as "La Bey," however British fur traders referred to it as "Green Bay," because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of "Green Bay" stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities.<ref>Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State page 188</ref>   In 1791, two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present day [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]].{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}

=== After independence ===

The Green Bay area was still under British control until the 1783 treaty formally ended the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Following the [[War of 1812]], which in part was over disputes related to the border with Canada, the United States built [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]] on the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] in 1816 to protect its northern border.<ref name="City of Green Bay"/> Doty, Whitney, Arndt, Baird and Martin were among the many British-American settlers whose numbers pushed French culture into the background.<ref name="City of Green Bay"/>

The [[Erie Canal]] was completed in 1825, linking New England with the Great Lakes. This led to the advance of Green Bay as a trading center. The end of the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832 also gave impetus to settlement of the region. Most of the settlers were farmers from New England who began using the Erie Canal to pour into Wisconsin. As more and more New England settlers arrived, Green Bay developed into a trading center for this population.<ref>Wisconsin Encyclopedia By Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration, Jennifer L. Herman page 336</ref>

Wisconsin's first newspaper, ''The [[Green Bay Intelligencer]]'', was started in 1833 by [[Albert Gallatin Ellis|Albert Ellis]] and [[John Voorhees Suydam|John V. Suydam]]. The borough of Green Bay, created in 1838, is the center of the present-day city. The borough combined the town of Astor (a company town of the [[American Fur Company]]) with Navarino, platted by [[Daniel Whitney (Wisconsin entrepreneur)|Daniel Whitney]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Deborah Beaumont |last2=Beaumont |first2=Sophie |title=Old Green Bay |url=https://archive.org/details/oldgreenbay00mart |access-date=September 13, 2013 |year=1899 |publisher=Cheltenham Press |location=New York |page=35}}</ref> Before Wisconsin became a state in 1848, its commerce was based on the [[fur trade]], which became dominated by [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]]. After statehood, there was a shift away from fur trading toward lumbering. "For&nbsp;a short time in 1860s and 1870s, iron smelting in charcoal kilns rivaled the timber industry while the port handled increasing amounts of fuel, feed, and lumber. Today's major local industry had its start in 1865 when the first paper mill was built."<ref name="City of Green Bay"/>

[[File:Green Bay 1867.jpg|thumb|right|1867 bird's eye illustration of Green Bay]]

By 1850 the town had a population of 1,923. The town was incorporated as the city of Green Bay in 1854. The [[Green Bay Area Public School District]] was founded in 1856.<ref name="City of Green Bay"/> Throughout the 1850s, word spread of America's cheap land and good soil, bringing in an influx of [[Belgian people]], German, Scandinavian, Irish and Dutch immigrants, each adding to the culture. The greatest concentration of newcomers came from Belgium. They cleared the land to farm and build their homes.<ref name="City of Green Bay"/>

The railroad arrived in the 1860s. The three railroads that would reach Green Bay were the Chicago & North Western (C&NW), SOO Line, (SOO), and the Milwaukee Road (MILW). These railroads were highways which allowed people and products to travel all over the state, increasing business and trade opportunities. The area was able to grow and enrich itself with the use of the plentiful timber resources. This led to the paper industry becoming the major employer in Green Bay, and opened up the port for international trade.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Like other cities with this type of climate, there are four distinct [[season]]s, often with severe or extreme variation between them in terms of temperature and precipitation. Green Bay experiences warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. The variance in temperature and precipitation between months is severe and often extreme. [[Tornado]]es are rare in the Green Bay area, with the strongest being an [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado that hit the community of [[Pittsfield, Wisconsin|Pittsfield]] on June 26, 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com|title=Tornado History Project: Maps and Statistics|website=Tornadohistoryproject.com|access-date=September 9, 2017|archive-date=January 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117024312/http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|16.6|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|69.1|°F|1}} in July.<ref name=NOAA/> In July, the warmest month, the average high temperature is {{convert|81.2|°F|1}}.<ref name=NOAA/> There are 6.1 days of {{convert|90|F|0}}+ highs, 68 days where the high remains at or below freezing, and 19 days with sub-{{convert|0|F|0}} lows annually. From December to February, even during thaws, the temperature rarely reaches {{convert|50|F|0}}. Extremes have ranged from {{convert|−36|F|0}} on January 21, 1888, to {{convert|104|F|0}} on July 13, 1936.

The wettest month in Green Bay is August, when {{convert|3.77|in|mm}} of precipitation falls, mostly in the form of rainfall from [[thunderstorm]]s. The driest month in Green Bay is February, when the majority of precipitation falls as low moisture-content snow due to cold, dry air. On average, {{convert|1.01|in|mm}} of precipitation falls in February.
