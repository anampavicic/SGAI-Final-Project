'''Sidi Kacem''' ({{langx|ar|سيدي قاسم|sidi qasəm}}) is a city in [[Rabat-Salé-Kénitra]], [[Morocco]]. It is the capital of [[Sidi Kacem Province]].

==History==

During the French period, the city was called '''Petitjean''', in reference to a French captain who was killed in May 1911 during the "pacification" of Morocco. The French started oil drilling exploration in the vicinity of Sidi Kacem in 1934; production of crude oil began locally in 1939.<ref>British Petroleum Company, ''Our Industry, Petroleum: A Handbook'', published 1977, 600 pages</ref>

Slightly to the south of Sidi Kacem lies [[Volubilis]], which was in antiquity an important Roman town near the westernmost border of the [[Roman Empire]]. It was built on the site of a previous [[Mauretania]]n [[Human settlement|settlement]] from the third century [[Before Christ|BC]], if not earlier.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C.Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham (2007)]</ref>

==Weather==
Summers are hot to very hot, highs clock between {{cvt|32 and 36|°C}}. Winters in the other hand are comparatively chilly, especially at night, and lows usually go beyond the freezing point. During the winter it rains with an average precipitation of {{cvt|350 and 600|mm}}. It does not snow in Sidi Kacem.{{Attribution needed|date=May 2017}}

==Education==
There are no universities in Sidi Kacem, and the only higher education available is in the Prince Moulay Abdellah Technical High School, where students can get a Higher Diploma in Electrical studies. Most residents of the city who seek higher education travel to [[Kenitra]], where they can attend [[Ibn Tofail University]], or other larger cities.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

==Transportation==
Sidi Kacem's small taxis have fixed tolls depending on from where you are going and your destination. Add 50% of the toll at night.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

Sidi Kacem is located along Morocco's national [[ONCF]] railway line and was considered a crossroads because passengers going to the North had to switch trains in its station. This is not longer the case as the ONCF has constructed a direct railway which doesn't cross Sidi Kacem.{{Attribution needed|date=May 2017}}

The town has a local bus station, which serves all the regions of the country, in addition to multiple grand-taxis stations, for the nearest cities and villages.{{fact|date=July 2021}}
