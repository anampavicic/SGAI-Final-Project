'''Idlib Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|مُحافظة ادلب}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Muḥāfaẓat Idlib'') is one of the 14 [[Governorates of Syria|governorates]] of [[Syria]]. It is situated in northwestern Syria, bordering [[Turkey]]'s [[Hatay province]] to the north, [[Aleppo Governorate]] to the east, [[Hama Governorate]] to the south, and [[Latakia Governorate]] to the west.

===Syrian Civil War (2011–present)===
{{Main|Syrian civil war}}
====Idlib contested by Syrian government and rebels (2011–17)====
The [[Idlib Governorate clashes (September 2011 – March 2012)]] were violent incidents involving the newly formed [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) and government-loyal forces, during which the FSA took control of [[Saraqib]], [[Binnish]], [[Sarmin]], [[Ariha, Syria|Ariha]], [[Zardana]], [[al-Bara]] and [[Taftanaz]]. This included the 10 March [[Battle of Idlib (2012)]], a government victory. This led to the [[April 2012 Idlib Governorate Operation]] in which the government unsuccessfully sought to regain control. A consequent cease-fire attempt lasted from 14 April to 2 June 2012. This was followed by the [[Idlib Governorate clashes (June 2012–April 2013)]], in which the FSA took or regained control of [[Salqin]], [[Armanaz]], [[Harem, Syria|Harem]], Sarmin, [[Darkush]], [[Kafr Nabl]], [[Maarrat al-Nu'man]] and Taftanaz, while government forces maintained control over [[Jisr ash-Shugur]], [[Fu'ah]], [[Idlib]] city, [[Abu al-Thuhur|Abu al-Duhur]] airbase and [[Khan Shaykhun]] and recaptured Ariha. The [[Siege of Wadi Deif]] military base from October 2012 through April 2013 was also broken.

The [[2014 Idlib offensive]] was a series of operations conducted by the rebels against the Syrian Government. The clashes were mostly concentrated around Khan Shaykhun and on the highway towards Maarrat al-Nu'man, and resulted in rebel victory. In the March [[Battle of Idlib (2015)]], [[al-Nusra Front]]/[[Army of Conquest]]-led rebels retook Idlib city from government and [[Hezbollah]] forces.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12392.aspx |title=Gulf allies and 'Army of Conquest |newspaper=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |date=28 May 2015 |access-date=4 September 2018 |archive-date=17 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417102743/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12392.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[Battle of Maarrat al-Nu'man (2016)]] on 13 March 2016, fighters from the [[Salafist jihadist]] groups al-Nusra Front and [[Jund al-Aqsa]] launched an overnight attack against the FSA's [[13th Division (Syrian rebel group)|13th Division]] headquarters in the town of Maarrat al-Nu'man to crush local protesters and demonstrations.<ref name="syhr">{{Cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=45026|title=Division 13 evacuate most of its headquarters in the southern countryside of Idlib and clashes between them against Jabhat Al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa in Maarrat al-Nu'man area and tension prevails in the area|publisher=Syrian Observatory For Human Rights|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-14|date=2016-03-13|archive-date=2016-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328175047/http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=45026|url-status=live}}</ref> The battle resulted in a victory for the jihadis. The [[October 2016 Idlib Governorate clashes]] were violent confrontations between Jund al-Aqsa and the [[Syrian rebel]] group the [[Ahrar al-Sham]], the latter supported by several other rebel groups.

The [[Idlib Governorate clashes (January–March 2017)]] were military confrontations between Syrian rebel factions led by Ahrar al-Sham and their allies on one side and the [[Jabhat Fatah al-Sham]] (later as [[Hayat Tahrir al-Sham]]) and their allies on the other. After 7 February, the clashes also included Jund al-Aqsa as a third belligerent, which had re-branded itself as ''Liwa al-Aqsa'' and was attacking the other combatants. The battles were fought in the Idlib Governorate and the western countryside of the [[Aleppo Governorate]].

The [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]] took place on 4 April 2017, on the town of Khan Shaykhun, then under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).<ref>{{cite
