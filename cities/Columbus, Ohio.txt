Columbus originated as numerous Native American settlements on the banks of the [[Scioto River]]. [[Franklinton (Columbus, Ohio)|Franklinton]], now a city neighborhood, was the first European settlement, laid out in 1797. The city was founded in 1812 at the [[confluence]] of the Scioto and [[Olentangy River|Olentangy]] rivers, and laid out to become the state capital. The city was named for Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name="WaPo"/> The city assumed the function of state capital in 1816 and county seat in 1824. Amid steady years of growth and industrialization, the city has experienced numerous floods and recessions. Beginning in the 1950s, Columbus began to experience significant growth; it became the largest city in Ohio in land and population by the early 1990s. Growth has continued in the 21st century, with redevelopment occurring in numerous city neighborhoods, including [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|Downtown]].

The city has a diverse economy without reliance on any one sector. The metropolitan area is home to the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], the world's largest private research and development foundation; [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], the world's largest clearinghouse of chemical information; and the [[Ohio State University]], one of the [[List of United States public university campuses by enrollment|largest universities in the United States]]. The Greater Columbus area is further home to the headquarters of six [[Fortune 500]] companies, namely [[Cardinal Health]], [[American Electric Power]], [[Bath & Body Works, Inc.]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company|Nationwide]], [[Bread Financial]] and [[Huntington Bancshares]].

==History==
{{main|History of Columbus, Ohio}}
{{For timeline}}

===Ancient and early history===
[[File:Shrum Mound aerial 3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shrum Mound]] in Campbell Memorial Park]]
Between 1000 B.C. and 1700 A.D., the Columbus metropolitan area was a center to indigenous cultures known as the [[Mound Builders]], including the [[Adena culture|Adena]], [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Fort Ancient]] peoples. Remaining physical evidence of the cultures are their burial mounds and what they contained. Most of Central Ohio's remaining mounds are located outside of Columbus city boundaries, though the [[Shrum Mound]] is maintained, now as part of a public park and historic site. The city's Mound Street derives its name from a mound that existed by the intersection of Mound and [[High Street (Columbus, Ohio)|High Street]]s. The mound's clay was used in bricks for most of the city's initial brick buildings; many were subsequently used in the [[Ohio Statehouse]]. The city's [[Ohio History Center]] maintains a collection of artifacts from these cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.experiencecolumbus.com/blog/post/5-places-in-central-ohio-to-experience-native-american-history/|title=6 Places in Central Ohio to Experience Native American History|date=July 5, 2018|website=www.experiencecolumbus.com|access-date=May 17, 2020|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728174336/https://www.experiencecolumbus.com/blog/post/5-places-in-central-ohio-to-experience-native-american-history/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Up until the [[American Revolution]], Central Ohio had continuously been the home of numerous indigenous villages. A [[Mingo]] village was located at the forks of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, with Shawnee villages to the south and Wyandot and Delaware villages to the north. Colonial militiamen burned down the Mingo village in 1774 during a raid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190407/as-it-were-treaty-couldnt-oust-local-indians|title=As It Were: Treaty couldn't oust local Indians|access-date=July 15, 2021|archive-date=July 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210715190226/https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190407/as-it-were-treaty-couldnt-oust-local-indians|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Virginia Military District====
{{Main|Virginia Military District}}
After the American Revolution, the [[Virginia Military District]] became part of the Ohio Country as a territory of Virginia. Colonists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty [[frontier]], they encountered people of the [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], [[Shawnee]] and [[Mingo]] nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, leading to years of bitter conflict. The decisive [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795, which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young surveyor from Virginia named [[Lucas Sullivant]] had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers. An admirer of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Sullivant chose to name his frontier village "[[Franklinton (Columbus, Ohio)|Franklinton]]."<ref>Lentz, p. 33</ref> The location was desirable for its proximity to the navigable rivers – but Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large flood wiped out the new settlement.<ref>Moore, p. 101</ref> He persevered, and the village was rebuilt, though somewhat more inland.

After the Revolution, land comprising parts of Franklin and adjacent counties was set aside by the [[United States Congress]] for settlement by [[Canadians]] and [[Nova Scotia]]ns who were sympathetic to the colonial cause and had their land and possessions seized by the British government. The [[Refugee Tract]], consisting of {{convert|103000|acre}}, was {{convert|42|mile}} long and {{convert|3-4.5|mile}} wide, and was claimed by 67 eligible men. The Ohio Statehouse sits on land once contained in the Refugee Tract.<ref name="Lands">{{cite book|last=Knepper|first=George W.|title=The Official Ohio Lands Book|publisher=The Auditor of the State of Ohio|page=51|url=https://ohioauditor.gov/publications/OhioLandsBook.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024222807/https://ohioauditor.gov/publications/OhioLandsBook.pdf |archive-date=October 24, 2014 |url-status=live|date=2002|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:View of Columbus O. From Capitol University.png|thumb|View of the city from [[Capital University]] in 1854]]
After [[Ohio]] achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among prominent Ohio leaders led to the state capital moving from [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] to [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and back again. Desiring to settle on a location, the state legislature considered [[Franklinton (Columbus, Ohio)|Franklinton]], [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]], [[Worthington, Ohio|Worthington]] and [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]] before compromising on a plan to build a new city in the state's center, near major transportation routes, primarily rivers. As well, Franklinton landowners had donated two {{convert|10|acre|adj=on}} plots in an effort to convince the state to move its capital there.<ref name="attb">{{cite web|title=Statehouse|work=Ohio Statehouse|publisher=Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/about/capitol-square/statehouse|access-date=May 18, 2020|archive-date=May 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200531203224/http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/about/capitol-square/statehouse|url-status=live}}</ref> The two spaces were set to become [[Capitol Square]], including for the [[Ohio Statehouse]] and the [[Ohio Penitentiary]]. Named in honor of [[Christopher Columbus]], the city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the "High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto most known as Wolf's Ridge."<ref>Lentz, pp. 41–43</ref> At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.<ref>Moore, p. 122</ref>

The city was incorporated as a borough on February 10, 1816.<ref name="Manual">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p0Y_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA7|title=Legislative Manual of the State of Ohio|first=Ohio General|last=Assembly|date=May 22, 1912|via=Google Books|access-date=May 11, 2020|archive-date=September 20, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920165816/https://books.google.com/books?id=p0Y_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA7|url-status=live}}</ref> Nine people were elected to fill the municipality's various positions of mayor, treasurer and several others.

Between 1816 and 1817, [[Jarvis W. Pike]] served as the first appointed mayor. Although the recent [[War of 1812]] had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the new town's success. Early conditions were abysmal, with frequent bouts of fevers, attributed to [[malaria]] from the flooding rivers, and an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1833. It led Columbus to create the Board of Health, now part of the [[Columbus Public Health]] department. The outbreak, which remained in the city from July to September 1833, killed 100 people.<ref name="earlyhistory">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisweeknews.com/article/20120320/NEWS/303209518|title=Summer 1833 was a time of cholera in Columbus|website=ThisWeek Community News|access-date=May 11, 2020|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728171259/https://www.thisweeknews.com/article/20120320/NEWS/303209518|url-status=live}}</ref>

Columbus was without direct river or trail connections to other Ohio cities, leading to slow initial growth. The [[National Road]] reached Columbus from [[Baltimore]] in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]], both of which facilitated a population boom.<ref>Lentz, p. 58</ref><ref name="earlyhistory"/> A wave of European [[immigrants]] led to the creation of two ethnic [[enclave]]s on the city's outskirts. A large [[Irish people|Irish]] population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the [[Germans]] took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as the ''[[German Village|Das Alte Südende]]'' (The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries, [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]] and [[Capital University]].<ref name = "zuahxa">Lentz, pp. 63–64</ref>

With a population of 3,500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. On that day, the legislature carried out a [[Private bill|special act]], which granted legislative authority to the [[city council]] and judicial authority to the mayor. Elections were held in April of that year, with voters choosing [[John Brooks (mayor)|John Brooks]] as the first popularly elected mayor.<ref>Moore, p. 156</ref> Columbus annexed the then-separate city of Franklinton in 1837.<ref name="test">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ-DgBzxfx4C&q=columbus+annexed+franklinton&pg=PA7 |title=Columbus 1860-1910 |date=April 26, 2006 |access-date=March 15, 2013 |isbn=9780738539621 |last1=Barrett |first1=Richard E. |publisher=Arcadia |archive-date=September 20, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920165814/https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ-DgBzxfx4C&q=columbus+annexed+franklinton&pg=PA7 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1850, the [[Columbus and Xenia Railroad]] became the first railroad into the city, followed by the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] in 1851. The two railroads built a joint [[Union Station (Columbus, Ohio)|Union Station]] on the east side of High Street just north of Naghten (then called North Public Lane). Rail traffic into Columbus increased: by 1875, eight railroads served Columbus, and the rail companies built a new, more elaborate station.<ref>

On January 7, 1857, the [[Ohio Statehouse]] finally opened after 18 years of construction.<ref>Lentz, pp. 70–71</ref> Site construction continued until 1861.

Before the abolition of slavery in the [[Southern United States]] in 1863, the [[Underground Railroad]] was active in Columbus and was led, in part, by [[James Preston Poindexter]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cole |first1=Charles Chester |title=A Fragile Capital: Identity and the Early Years of Columbus, Ohio |date=2001 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |isbn=9780814208533 |pages=193–204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwfDYWIRiPMC&pg=PA193 |language=en |access-date=October 25, 2020 |archive-date=September 20, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920170315/https://books.google.com/books?id=fwfDYWIRiPMC&pg=PA193 |url-status=live }}</ref> Poindexter arrived in Columbus in the 1830s and became a Baptist preacher and leader in the city's African-American community until the turn of the century.<ref name="obit">{{cite news |title=A Notable Colored Man has just Passed Away |newspaper=Xenia Daily Gazette |location=Xenia, Ohio |date=February 8, 1907 |page=7 |access-date=October 5, 2016 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6906223// |via=Newspapers.com |archive-date=September 20, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920170243/https://www.newspapers.com/article/6906223/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Columbus was a major base for the volunteer [[Union Army]]. It housed 26,000 troops and held up to 9,000 [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[prisoners of war]] at [[Camp Chase]], at what is now [[Hilltop (Columbus, Ohio)|the Hilltop]] neighborhood of west Columbus. Over 2,000 Confederate soldiers remain buried at the site, making it one of the North's largest Confederate cemeteries.<ref>Lentz, p. 78</ref> North of Columbus, along the Delaware Road, the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] established [[Camp Thomas]], where the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th U.S. Infantry]] organized and trained.

By virtue of the [[Morrill Act of 1862]], the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College – which eventually became the [[Ohio State University]] – was founded in 1870 on the former estate of William and Hannah Neil.<ref>Lentz, p.57</ref>

[[File:Central Market 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Central Market (Columbus, Ohio)|Central Market]], pictured here in 1898, operated from 1814 to 1966.]]
By the end of the 19th century, Columbus was home to several major manufacturing businesses. The city became known as the "Buggy Capital of the World," thanks to the two dozen [[Carriage|buggy]] factories – notably the [[Columbus Buggy Company]], founded in 1875 by C.D. Firestone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touringohio.com/central/franklin/columbus/columbus-buggy.html|title=Columbus Buggy Company|website=touringohio.com|access-date=April 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408082210/http://touringohio.com/central/franklin/columbus/columbus-buggy.html|archive-date=April 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Columbus Consolidated Brewing Company also rose to prominence during this time and might have achieved even greater success were it not for the [[Anti-Saloon League]] in neighboring [[Westerville, Ohio|Westerville]].<ref>Lentz, pp. 85–87</ref>

In the [[steel|steel industry]], a forward-thinking man named [[Samuel P. Bush]] presided over the [[Buckeye Steel Castings]] Company. Columbus was also a popular location for labor organizations. In 1886, [[Samuel Gompers]] founded the [[American Federation of Labor]] in Druid's Hall on South Fourth Street, and in 1890, the [[United Mine Workers of America]] was founded at [[Columbus City Hall (1872–1921)|the old City Hall]].<ref>Lentz, pp. 91–92</ref> In 1894, [[James Thurber]], who would go on to an illustrious literary career in Paris and New York City, was born in the city. Today, Ohio State's theater department has a performance center named in his honor, and his childhood home, the [[Thurber House]], is located in the Discovery District and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Columbus earned one of its nicknames, "The Arch City," because of the [[Columbus streetcar arches|dozens of wooden arches]] that spanned High Street at the turn of the 20th century. The arches illuminated the thoroughfare and eventually became the means by which electric power was provided to the new [[streetcar]]s. The city tore down the arches and replaced them with cluster lights in 1914 but reconstructed them from metal in [[the Short North]] neighborhood in 2002 for their unique historical interest.<ref>Lentz, pp. 94–95</ref>

On March 25, 1913, the [[Great Flood of 1913]] devastated the neighborhood of Franklinton, leaving over 90 people dead and thousands of West Side residents homeless. To prevent flooding, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] recommended widening the Scioto River through downtown, constructing new bridges and building a [[retaining wall]] along its banks. With the strength of the post-[[World War I]] economy, a construction boom occurred in the 1920s, resulting in a new [[civic center]], the [[Ohio Theatre (Columbus, Ohio)|Ohio Theatre]], the [[American Insurance Union Citadel]] and to the north, a massive new [[Ohio Stadium]].<ref>Lentz, pp. 112–113</ref> Although the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]] was founded in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] in 1920, its head offices moved to Columbus in 1921 to the [[16 East Broad Street|New Hayden Building]] and remained in the city until 1941.

In 1922, the association's name was changed to the [[National Football League]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL History |publisher=CBS Sportsline.com |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930 |access-date=December 24, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134638/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930 |archive-date=April 10, 2016  }}</ref> Nearly a decade later, in 1931, at a convention in the city, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] took that name by which they are known today.

The effects of the [[Great Depression]] were less severe in Columbus, as the city's diversified economy helped it fare better than its [[Rust Belt]] neighbors. [[World War II]] brought many new jobs and another population surge. This time, most new arrivals were migrants from the "extraordinarily depressed rural areas" of [[Appalachia]], who would soon account for more than a third of Columbus's growing population.<ref>Lentz, pp.116–118</ref> In 1948, the Town and Country Shopping Center opened in suburban [[Whitehall, Ohio|Whitehall]], and it is now regarded as one of the first modern shopping centers in the United States.<ref>Lentz, p. 122</ref>

The construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] signaled the arrival of rapid suburb development in central Ohio. To protect the city's tax base from this suburbanization, Columbus adopted a policy of linking sewer and water hookups to [[annexation]] to the city.<ref>Lentz, p. 129</ref> By the early 1990s, Columbus had grown to become Ohio's largest city in land area and in population.

Efforts to revitalize [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown Columbus]] have had some success in recent decades,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/realestate/commercial/downtown-columbus-comes-to-life-with-millennial-tower.html|title=Open Spaces Bring Light to Downtown Columbus|last=Schneider|first=Keith|date=May 31, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 16, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211014655/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/realestate/commercial/downtown-columbus-comes-to-life-with-millennial-tower.html|archive-date=February 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> though like most major American cities, some architectural heritage was lost in the process. In the 1970s, landmarks such as [[Union Station (Columbus, Ohio)|Union Station]] and the [[Neil House]] hotel were razed to construct high-rise offices and big retail space. The [[PNC Bank Building (Columbus, Ohio)|PNC Bank building]] was constructed in 1977, as well as the [[One Nationwide Plaza|Nationwide Plaza]] buildings and other towers that sprouted during this period. The construction of the [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]] has brought major conventions and trade shows to the city.

The [[Scioto Mile]] began development along the riverfront, an area that already had the [[Miranova Place|Miranova Corporate Center]] and [[The Condominiums at North Bank Park]].

The [[2010 United States foreclosure crisis]] forced the city to purchase numerous foreclosed, vacant properties to renovate or demolish them – at a cost of tens of millions of dollars.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Columbus, Ohio}}
[[File:Columbus by Sentinel-2, 2020-09-21.jpg|thumb|Aerial satellite image of Columbus]]
The confluence of the [[Scioto River|Scioto]] and [[Olentangy River|Olentangy]] rivers is just northwest of [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|Downtown Columbus]]. Several smaller tributaries course through the [[Columbus metropolitan area, Ohio|Columbus metropolitan area]], including [[Alum Creek (Ohio)|Alum Creek]], [[Big Walnut Creek]] and [[Big Darby Creek|Darby Creek]]. Columbus is considered to have relatively flat [[topography]] thanks to a large [[glacier]] that covered most of Ohio during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin Ice Age]]. However, there are sizable differences in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin County being {{convert|1132|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Height above sea level|above sea level]] near [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], and the low point being {{convert|670|ft|m|abbr=on}} where the Scioto River leaves the county near [[Lockbourne, Ohio|Lockbourne]].<ref name="fracomap">{{Cite book| last =Ringle | first =Dean C.| title =Franklin County Ohio Road Map & Street Locator| publisher =Franklin County Engineer| year =2007| location =Franklin County, Ohio}}</ref>

Several ravines near the rivers and creeks also add variety to the landscape. Tributaries to Alum Creek and the Olentangy River cut through shale, while tributaries to the Scioto River cut through limestone. The numerous rivers and streams beside low-lying areas in Central Ohio contribute to a history of flooding in the region; the most significant was the [[Great Flood of 1913 in Columbus, Ohio]].<ref name="this week">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dispatch.com/story/archive/2013/03/26/meet-your-farmer-event-draws/39307936007/|title=Meet Your Farmer event draws crowd|first=Stephanie|last=Foster|website=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=March 4, 2023|archive-date=March 4, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230304204640/https://www.dispatch.com/story/archive/2013/03/26/meet-your-farmer-event-draws/39307936007/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As surrounding communities grew or were constructed, they came to require access to waterlines, which was under the sole control of the municipal water system. Rhodes told these communities that if they wanted water, they would have to submit to assimilation into Columbus.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard Z.|last=Zimmerman|editor-last=Lamis|editor-first=Alexander P.|editor2-last=Usher|editor2-first=Brian|title=Ohio Politics: Revised and Updated|year=2007|page=87|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=978-0-87338-613-5}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Columbus, Ohio}}
The city's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') transitional with the [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') to the south characterized by warm, muggy summers and cold, dry winters. Columbus is within [[USDA]] [[hardiness zone]] 6b, bordering on 7a. Winter snowfall is relatively light, since the city is not in the typical path of strong winter lows, such as the [[Nor'easter]]s that strike cities farther east. It is also too far south and west for [[lake-effect snow]] from [[Lake Erie]] to have much effect, although the lakes to the north contribute to long stretches of cloudy spells in winter.

The highest temperature recorded in Columbus is {{convert|106|F|0}}, which occurred twice during the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s: once on July 21, 1934, and again on July 14, 1936.<ref name="National Weather Service">[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/iln/cmhrec.htm Records for Columbus.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221145049/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/iln/cmhrec.htm |date=December 21, 2014 }} [[National Weather Service]]. Retrieved on November 16, 2008.</ref> The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-22|F|0}}, occurring on [[1994 North American cold wave|January 19, 1994]].<ref name="National Weather Service" />

Columbus is subject to [[severe weather]] typical to the [[Midwestern United States]]. Severe thunderstorms can bring [[lightning]], large [[hail]] and on rare occasions [[tornado]]es, especially during the spring and sometimes through fall. A tornado that occurred on October 11, 2006, caused [[Fujita Scale|F2]] damage.<ref>{{cite news| last =Tullis | first =Matt | author2=Mark Ferenchik| title =Ruin, relief and rebuilding Tornado aftermath| pages =NEWS 01A| newspaper =The Columbus Dispatch| date = October 13, 2006}}</ref> Floods, blizzards and ice storms can also occur from time to time.

Due to its demographics, which include a mix of races and a wide range of incomes, as well as urban, suburban and nearby rural areas, Columbus is considered a "typical" American city, leading [[chain store|retail and restaurant chains]] to use it as a [[test market]] for new products.<ref>{{cite news| last =Wolf  | first =Barnet D.  | title =Fresch Approach Long John Silver's test site tries grilling on for size   | newspaper =The Columbus Dispatch  | date =December 5, 2006}}</ref> For similar reasons, the city was chosen as the launch city for the [[QUBE]] cable television service.

Columbus has maintained a steady population growth since its establishment.

The Christopher Columbus Quincentennial Jubilee, celebrating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage, was held in the city in 1992.

The protests prevented the native village from being exhibited, and annual fasts continued until 1997.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Columbus, Ohio}}
[[File:AEP Building from Rhodes State.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[AEP Building]], headquarters to [[American Electric Power]]]]
Columbus has a generally strong and diverse economy based on education, insurance, banking, fashion, defense, aviation, food, logistics, steel, energy, medical research, health care, hospitality, retail and technology. In 2010, it was one of the 10 best big cities in the country, according to Relocate America, a real estate research firm.<ref name=CBJ>{{Cite news|title=Ranking: Columbus among top 10 big cities|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2010/04/19/daily28.html|date=April 21, 2010|access-date=December 26, 2022|newspaper=Columbus Business First|archive-date=May 28, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220528145048/https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2010/04/19/daily28.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]], the GDP of Columbus in 2019 was $134 billion (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=134000000000|start_year=2019}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NGMP18140 |title=Total Gross Domestic Product for Columbus, OH (MSA) (NGMP18140) &#124; FRED &#124; St. Louis Fed |publisher=Fred.stlouisfed.org |date=January 2001 |accessdate=November 20, 2021 |archive-date=January 5, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220105064440/https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NGMP18140 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[Great Recession]] between 2007 and 2009, Columbus's economy was not impacted as much as the rest of the country, due to decades of diversification work by long-time corporate residents, business leaders and political leaders. The administration of former mayor [[Michael B. Coleman]] continued this work, although the city faced financial turmoil and had to increase taxes, allegedly due in part to fiscal mismanagement.<ref>[http://thisweeknews.com/live/content/politics/LIVE_results/2009races/11/columbus_council.html?sid=104 "Recount Still Possible"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717051114/http://thisweeknews.com/live/content/politics/LIVE_results/2009races/11/columbus_council.html?sid=104 |date=July 17, 2011 }}, This Week Community Papers, Retrieved November 13, 2009.</ref><ref>[https://archive.today/20120905171030/http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/local/local_govtpolitics/article/the_final_push_for_issue_one/19305/ NBC 4, Columbus Budget Shortfall, Tax Increase] Retrieved July 26, 2009.</ref> Because Columbus is the state capital, there is a large government presence in the city.

Construction of the Ohio Statehouse began in 1839 on a {{convert|10|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} plot of land donated by four prominent Columbus landowners. This plot formed [[Capitol Square]], which was not part of the city's original layout. Built of Columbus [[limestone]] from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]], the Statehouse stands on foundations {{convert|18|ft|m}} deep that were laid by [[prison labor]] gangs rumored to have been composed largely of [[masonry|masons]] jailed for minor infractions.<ref name="attb"/> It features a central recessed [[porch]] with a [[colonnade]] of a forthright and primitive [[Doric order|Greek Doric mode]]. A broad and low central pediment supports the windowed [[astylar]] drum under an invisibly low [[dome|saucer dome]] that lights the interior [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. There are several artworks within and outside the building, including the ''[[William McKinley Monument]]'' dedicated in 1907. Unlike many U.S. state capitol buildings, the Ohio State Capitol owes little to the architecture of the [[United States Capitol|national Capitol]]. During the Statehouse's 22-year construction, seven architects were employed. The Statehouse was opened to the legislature and the public in 1857 and completed in 1861, and is located at the intersection of Broad and High streets in downtown Columbus.

Within the [[Driving Park]] heritage district lies the [[Captain Edward V. Rickenbacker House|original home]] of [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], a World War I [[fighter aircraft|fighter pilot]] ace.

====Demolitions and redevelopment====
{{see also|List of demolished buildings and structures in Columbus, Ohio}}
Demolition has been a common trend in Columbus for a long period of time, and continues into the present day.

Other major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road ([[Ohio State Route 161|SR-161]]), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road ([[Ohio State Highway 3|SR-3]]), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue and Livingston Avenue.

====Highways====
[[File:Spring and Long St bridges.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[I-71]], part of the [[innerbelt]] around downtown, bridged by numerous overpasses]]
Columbus is bisected by two major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]]: [[Interstate 70 in Ohio|Interstate 70]] running east–west and [[Interstate 71]] running north to roughly southwest. They combine downtown for about {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} in an area locally known as "The Split", which is a major [[traffic congestion]] point, especially during [[rush hour]]. [[U.S. Route 40 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 40]], originally known as the [[National Road]], runs east–west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. [[U.S. Route 23 in Ohio|U.S. Route 23]] runs roughly north–south, while [[U.S. Route 33 in Ohio|U.S. Route 33]] runs northwest-to-southeast. The [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] [[Ring road|Outerbelt]] encircles most of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), [[Ohio State Route 315|State Route 315]] on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a two- or three-hour drive of Columbus.

====Bridges====

====Airports====
[[File:John Glenn International Airport Departure level.jpg|thumb|[[John Glenn Columbus International Airport]] departure level]]
The city's primary airport, [[John Glenn Columbus International Airport]], is on the city's east side. Formerly known as Port Columbus, John Glenn provides service to [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, and [[Cancun, Mexico]] (on a seasonal basis), as well as to most domestic destinations, including all the major hubs along with [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]] and [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]]. The airport was a hub for [[Low-cost carrier|discount carrier]] [[Skybus Airlines]] and continues to be home to [[NetJets]], the world's largest [[fractional ownership]] air carrier.

After the war, Port Columbus Airport (now known as [[John Glenn Columbus International Airport]]) became the axis of a coordinated rail-to-air transcontinental system that moved passengers from the East Coast to the West. TAT, which later became [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]], provided commercial service, following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s promotion of Columbus to the nation for such a hub. Following the failure of a bond levy in 1927 to build the airport, Lindbergh campaigned in the city in 1928, and the next bond levy passed that year.<ref name=PCI /> On July 8, 1929, the airport opened for business with the inaugural TAT westbound flight from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma. Among the 19 passengers on that flight was [[Amelia Earhart]],<ref name=PCI /> with [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]] attending the opening ceremonies.<ref name=PCI />

In 1964, Ohio native [[Jerrie Mock|Geraldine Fredritz Mock]] became the first woman to fly solo around the world, leaving from Columbus and piloting the ''[[Spirit of Columbus]]''.

Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the [[Central Ohio Transit Authority]] (COTA). The service operates [[List of COTA bus routes|41 routes]] with a fleet of 440 buses, serving approximately 19 million passengers per year. COTA operates 23 regular fixed-service routes, 14 express services, a [[bus rapid transit]] route, a free downtown circulator, night service, an airport connector and other services.<ref name="2019ar">{{cite web|title=2019 Annual Report|work=Central Ohio Transit Authority|url=https://www.cota.com/who-we-are/2019-annual-report/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323174235/https://www.cota.com/who-we-are/2019-annual-report/|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 23, 2020|date=2019|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> [[LinkUS]], an initiative between COTA, the city, and the [[Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission]], is planning to add more rapid transit to Columbus, with three proposed corridors operating by 2030, and potentially a total of five by 2050.

Columbus does not have passenger rail service. The city's major train station, [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]], was a stop along [[Amtrak]]'s [[National Limited]] train service until 1977 and was razed in 1979,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028014238/http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archive-date=October 28, 2006|title=Columbus Union Station|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> and the [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]] now stands in its place. Until Amtrak's founding in 1971, the [[Penn Central]] ran the ''[[Cincinnati Limited]]'' to Cincinnati to the southwest (in prior years the train continued to New York City to the east); the ''[[Ohio State Limited]]'' between [[Cincinnati]] and [[Cleveland]], with Union Station serving as a major intermediate stop (the train going unnamed between 1967 and 1971); and the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis (train)|Spirit of St. Louis]],'' which ran between St. Louis and New York City until 1971. The station was also a stop along the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], the [[New York Central Railroad]], the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]], the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]], and the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]]. As the city lacks local, commuter or intercity trains, Columbus is now the largest city and metropolitan area in the U.S. without any passenger rail service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm|title=Metropolitan Areas Served by Amtrak|date=November 23, 2006|access-date=May 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624205811/http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm|archive-date=June 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081227/ts_nm/us_transportation_phoenix |title=Phoenix debuts light-rail system |date=December 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231085009/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081227/ts_nm/us_transportation_phoenix |archive-date=December 31, 2008 }}</ref> Numerous proposals to return rail service have been introduced; currently Amtrak plans to restore service to Columbus by 2035.
