'''La Guajira''' ({{IPA|es|la ɣwaˈxiɾa}}{{refn|In isolation, they are pronounced {{IPA|es|la|}} and {{IPA|es|gwaˈxiɾa|}} respectively. }}) is a [[departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Colombia]]. It occupies most of the [[Guajira Peninsula]] in the northeast region of the country, on the Caribbean Sea and bordering [[Venezuela]], at the northernmost tip of South America. The capital city of the department is [[Riohacha]].

Various indigenous tribes have populated the [[arid]] plains of the region long before the Spanish expeditions reached the Americas. In 1498, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] sailed around the peninsula of La Guajira, but the first European to set foot in what is known today as La Guajira was the Spanish explorer [[Juan de la Cosa]] in 1499. During the colonial era, the territory of La Guajira was disputed by the governors of [[Santa Marta]] and Venezuela, owing to deposits of pearls. English pirates, Frenchmen, and Germans also fought for control of the territory.

[[Martin Fernandez de Enciso]] founded [[Cabo de la Vela|Nuestra Señora Santa María de los Remedios del Cabo de la Vela]], the first colonial village in the territory. In 1535, [[Nikolaus Federmann|Nicolás de Federmán]] refounded the settlement as the village of Riohacha, as a result of constant attacks by the [[Wayuu people]]. In 1544, it was moved to the site of the present-day city. In 1871, the region was separated from the Department of Magdalena, and La Guajira became a national territory in its own right. The Intendance of La Guajira was created in 1898.<ref name="Colombian Air Force: Guajira">[http://www.fac.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=11564&facmil_2007=fe2958d2bfc1a59 Colombian Air Force: Guajira]</ref>

In 1911, the Colombian government created the Commissary of la Guajira. In the 1930s, numerous immigrants came to the area from the Middle East ([[Christian Arabs]], 
[[Maronites]] in particular, and [[Shia Islam|Shi'i Muslims]]) from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Jordan. They generally settled in  the city of [[Maicao]]. In 1954, the Intendance of la Guajira was created again and Riohacha was declared a municipality. Finally, in 1964, the Department of La Guajira was created.<ref name="Colombian Air Force: Guajira"/>

The economy of the department depends on royalties from the [[coal]] mining at [[Cerrejón]] (producing 24.9 million tons of export coal in 2004), [[natural gas]] exploitation, and salt mines. A popular ecotourist destination is [[Cabo de la Vela]], a small fishing village located on the headland of the peninsula in the [[La Guajira Desert|Guajira desert]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Guajira'' comes from the [[Cariban languages]]; it is the Spanish pronunciation of Wajiira or Wahiira. According to Picon, the word ''Guajiros'' was first used in the year 1600 to designate some 200 indigenous families inhabiting the region of Riohacha.<ref>Picon, François-René. 1996: p. 313</ref> They were known for having large herds of goats. The Spanish applied the term to all the indigenous in the peninsula who were goat herders. According to Oliver, the term ''Guajiro'' did not appear on Spanish records until the year 1626, in a document by a friar named Pedro Simón.<ref>Oliver, José. ''Reflexiones sobre los posibles orígenes del Wayuu (Guajiro)'', 1990: p. 84</ref><ref>[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf {{in lang|es}} Government of La Guajira: Guajira Development Plan - Etymology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529031022/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>

==Geography==

{{See also|Geography of Colombia}}

[[File:Guajirapeninsula1.png|thumb|left|200px|The Guajira peninsula]]

The northern part of the department consists of arid plains called the [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub]], whose dryness is caused by the rain shadow of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. These mountains rise to {{convert|5,775|m|ft}} in the south. The [[Sinú Valley dry forests]] lie in between. In the far south are the headwaters of the [[Cesar River]], which flow south towards the [[Magdalena River]].<ref name="ocaribe.org">[http://www.ocaribe.org/downloads/grupos/economia_competitividad/estudio_zif_guajira_venezuela.pdf {{in lang|es}} Observatorio del Caribe Colombiano: Grupo Regional de investigación en economía y competitividad en el Caribe colombiano by Weildler Guerra, Paola Quintero, Jorge Quintero and Ana María Maldonado]</ref>

The [[Ranchería River]], which also rises in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, crosses the [[Guajira Peninsula]] from south to north and flows through the Valley of Upar and into the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The [[Serranía del Perijá]] and the [[Montes de Oca (Colombia)|Montes de Oca]] lie in the southeastern part of the department, bordering Venezuela.<ref name="ocaribe.org"/>

The department was divided into three subregions based on geographical characteristics: Upper, Middle, and Southern Guajira. The Upper Guajira covers the northernmost part of the peninsula, with mostly scarce semi-[[desert]]ic vegetation. It has only an isolated, low-altitude mountain range, the [[Serranía de Macuira]] (865 m above sea level). The Middle Guajira region is mostly flat, with hills in some areas, presenting also an arid environment. The Southern Guajira covers the region of the Montes de Oca and the [[Serranía del Perijá]] mountain ranges on the border with Venezuela, and the valley formed with the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range. Southern Guajira has more green vegetation, wetlands and rivers.<ref name="ocaribe.org"/>

===Ecoregions===

The Department of La Guajira is within the [[Caribbean Region, Colombia|Colombian Caribbean region]], one of the five [[natural regions of Colombia|natural regions]] of Colombia.<ref name="laguajira.gov.co">[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf {{in lang|es}} Government of La Guajira: Development Plan - subregions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529031022/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>

====Serranía de Macuira====
[[File:Cerro La teta, La Guajira Colombia.png|thumb|right|200px|La Teta hill, located in the municipality of Uribia, northern Guajira]]

The [[Serranía de Macuira]] mountain range is located to the northwest of the [[Guajira Peninsula]] occupying an area of {{convert|35,000|ha|acre}}, {{convert|25,000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of which are contained within the Macuira National Park. The mountain range is an isolated ecosystem in the middle of the [[La Guajira Desert]], near the [[Caribbean Sea]], between the villages of Nazareth, Ichipa and Tawara. The mountain range works as a barrier to humid [[trade winds]], which blow from the northeast.<ref name="laguajira.gov.co"/>

====Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta====
The [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range is located on the Caribbean Sea and is shared with the departments of [[Department of Magdalena|Magdalena]] and [[Department of Cesar|Cesar]]. Most of the hydrographic reserves in the Department of La Guajira originate in this mountain range, including the [[Ranchería River]] which flows through most of the department from south to north.<ref name="laguajira.gov.co"/> The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta was declared by [[UNESCO]] as a Biosphere Reserve.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/147/ {{in lang|es}} UNESCO: Buritaca 200 - Ciudad Perdida - Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]</ref>

====Cerro Pintao====
The ''Cerro Pintao'' ("Painted Hill")—on the slopes of which sit the municipalities of San Juan del Cesar, El Molino, Villanueva, and Urumita and, in the Department of Cesar, the municipalities of [[Manaure, Cesar|Manaure]], [[La Paz, Cesar|La Paz]], [[San Diego, Cesar|San Diego]], and [[Codazzi]]—covers an area of {{convert|25,000|ha|acre}}, with altitudes ranging from {{convert|1,600|to|3,688|m|ft}}, forming a [[Páramo]] ecosystem, and gives birth to some 13 rivers of Colombia.<ref>[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf {{in lang|es}} Government of La Guajira: Guajira Development Plan - Cerro Pintao] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529031022/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>

====Flamingos Fauna and Flora Sanctuary====
The ''Santuario de Flora y Fauna los Flamencos'' ([[Flamingos Fauna and Flora Sanctuary]]) is located on the coastline of the municipality of Riohacha, between the village of Camarones and the [[Tapias River]], and covers {{convert|7,000|ha|acre}} The sanctuary has four [[lagoon]]s (Manzanillo, Navío Quebrado, Tocoromanes, and Laguna Grande) and numerous streams which serve as habitat for the [[flamingo]]s and numerous other endemic species.<ref>[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf {{in lang|es}} Government of La Guajira: Guajira Development Plan - Flamingos Fauna and Flora Sanctuary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529031022/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>

====Flamingos Protection Area====
Located in the village of [[Musichi]], the Flamingos Protection Area is within the municipality of Manaure and contains numerous lagoons that are used by locals for the artisanal making of salt.<ref>[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf {{in lang|es}} Government of La Guajira: Guajira Development Plan - Flamingos Protection Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529031022/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>

==History==

===Pre-Columbian<!--not misspelled; not "Pre-Colombian"-->===
[[File:CABO DE LA VELA.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The [[Cabo de la Vela]] was one of the first sites that Spanish explorers first sighted upon their arrival to the continental [[Americas]].]]

During the [[pre-Columbian]]<!--not misspelled; not "Pre-Colombian"--> era, present-day La Guajira was inhabited predominantly by indigenous tribes belonging, in the dry northern lowlands, mostly to the [[Wayuu]] (Guajiros, Macuiros, Anates, Caquetios, Wayunaiki, Cuanaos, Onotos and Eneales) and [[Cocina people|Cocina]] people, and, in the south, to the [[Kogi people|Kogui]], [[Arhuaco people|Arhuaco]], [[Guanebucan people|Guanebucan]], and [[Chimila people|Chimila]] ethnic groups, among others.<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf {{in lang|es}} Government of La Guajira: Guajira Development Plan - History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529031022/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf |date=May 29, 2008 }}</ref> Archaeological digs have uncovered the sites of fishing communities that used pottery on the central eastern side of the [[Guajira Peninsula]], dating to the 10th century BC.<ref>{{cite web |title=Los apaalanchi: una visión del mar entre los wayuu |trans-title=The Apaalanchi: the Wayuu's vision of the sea |date=2001 |website=Banco de la República |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/antropologia/apaalanchi/apaalanchi0a.htm |language=es |access-date=19 September 2019}}</ref>

These groups coexisted on the Guajira Peninsula. The northern indigenous peoples were nomads traveling the peninsula, hunting, fishing, and collecting fruit. The indigenous groups in the south were semi-sedentary, practicing agriculture and exploiting coastal resources.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Spanish conquest and colonization===
[[File:AlonsoDeOjeda.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Alonso de Ojeda]].]]

In 1498, the Guajira Peninsula was first seen by Spanish explorers led by [[Alonso de Ojeda]], who sailed the coast, but didn't land.<ref>[http://dibulla-laguajira.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-I1--&m=f&s=m {{in lang|es}} Dibuya: History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120715115333/http://dibulla-laguajira.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-I1--&m=f&s=m |date=2012-07-15 }}</ref> In 1502, a Spanish expedition led by [[Juan de la Cosa]] was the first to disembark at [[Cabo de la Vela]].<ref>[http://www.alcaldiaderiohacha.gov.co/ {{in lang|es}} Government of Riohacha: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128094113/http://www.alcaldiaderiohacha.gov.co/ |date=2004-11-28 }}</ref>

In 1524, [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] created the government of Santa Marta which encompassed an area from [[Cabo de la Vela]] to the mouth of the [[Magdalena River]].<ref>{{in lang|es}} Juan Friede, "La conquista del territorio y el poblamiento", ''Manual de Historia de Colombia'', 3 Vols., Vol. 1, Bogotá, [[Instituto Colombiano de Cultura]], 1982, pp.116-222, p.131.</ref>

In 1535, [[Martín Fernández de Enciso]] founded the first settlement in La Guajira, a village, near present-day [[Cabo de la Vela]], called ''Nuestra Señora Santa María de los Remedios del Cabo de la Vela''. In 1544, due to constant attacks from the indigenous, and from Spanish from the neighboring Captaincy of Venezuela who were after the large deposits of pearls, the village was moved to present-day Riohacha and refounded by [[Nikolaus Federmann]].<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/geografia/geo75.htm |title=Luis Angel Arango Library: History of La Guajira |access-date=2008-03-25 |archive-date=2010-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045742/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/geografia/geo75.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/geografia/geo75.htm |title=LABLAA - La Guajira: History |access-date=2008-03-25 |language=es |archive-date=2010-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045742/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/geografia/geo75.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Between 1609 and 1640, the Spanish colonizers imported some 800 or more African slaves. Most of these later escaped and formed palenques. In 1679, the Government of Santa Marta offered these palenques their freedom in exchange for their helping to protect the territory from English pirates and the government of Venezuela who coveted the Guajira Peninsula because of its [[pearl]]s.<ref name="universia.net.co"/>

La Guajira was one of the territories in Colombia that endured a period of isolation during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], due to the resistance of the indigenous peoples, predominantly the Wayuu. It was not until the 18th century that the [[Spanish monarchy]] ordered the complete conquest of the region, and the conflict between colonizers and indigenous prevailed throughout the 19th century.<ref name="universia.net.co">[http://www.universia.net.co/view-document/documento-283.html {{in lang|es}} La guerra de los Cárdenas y los Valdeblánquez (1970-1989) Estudio de un conflicto mestizo en La Guajira by Simón Uribe Martínez and Nicolás Cárdenas Angel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122090906/http://www.universia.net.co/view-document/documento-283.html |date=2015-01-22 }}</ref>

====The Guajira rebellion====
[[File:Map of La Guajira 1769.png|thumb|left|250px|Map of La Guajira in 1769.]]

The Wayuu were never subjugated by the Spanish, and the two groups were in a more or less permanent state of war. There were rebellions in 1701 (when the Wayuu destroyed a Capuchin mission), 1727 (when more than 2,000 Indians attacked the Spanish), 1741, 1757, 1761, and 1768. In 1718, Governor Soto de Herrera called the Wayuu, "barbarians, horse thieves, worthy of death, without God, without law and without a king". Of all the Indians in the territory of Colombia, they were unique in having learned the use of firearms and horses.<ref name="banrep.gov.co">[http://www.banrep.gov.co/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/junio1990/junio2.htm {{in lang|es}} Luis Angel Arango Library: The Guajira rebellion]</ref>

[[File:Pedro Messía de la Cerda (3).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pedro Messía de la Cerda]], Viceroy of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].]]

In 1769, the Spanish took 22 Wayuu captive, in order to put them to work building the fortifications of Cartagena. The reaction of their fellow Indians was unexpected. On May 2, 1769, at El Rincón, near [[Riohacha|Río de la Hacha]], they set the village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it, and capturing the priest. The Spanish immediately dispatched an expedition from El Rincón to capture the Indians. At the head of this force was José Antonio de Sierra, a mestizo who had also headed the party that had taken the 22 Guajiro captives. The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed.<ref name="banrep.gov.co"/>

This success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Messía, at its peak there were 20,000 Indians under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. These enabled the rebels to capture nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards who could took refuge in Río de la Hacha and sent urgent messages to [[Maracaibo]], Valle de Upar, Santa Marta, and Cartagena. Cartagena sent 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death, a battle between them being fought at La Soledad. That and the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements quelled the rebellion, but not before the Guajiro had regained much territory.<ref name="banrep.gov.co"/>

===Republican era===
In 1846, the new government of the [[Republic of New Granada]] created the "Guajiro territory", from part of the State of Magdalena, but the indigenous traded in contraband on a large scale, problems with the authorities continued, and the territory was once again put under the government of Santa Marta.<ref name="universia.net.co"/>

In 1871, once again the territory of La Guajira was put under separate administration and became a national territory. La Guajira became an ''intendencia'' in 1898 and a commissary in 1911. In 1954, it was demoted back to ''intendencia'', until 1964, when the Department of La Guajira was created.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

====The Evangelization of the indigenous peoples====
[[File:Wayuu on horses 1928.png|thumb|left|200px|Wayuu riding on horses. 1928.]]

The process of [[evangelizing]] the Wayuu people restarted in 1887 with the return of the [[Capuchin friars]] under reverend friar José María de Valdeviejas. In 1905, [[Pope Pius X]] created the [[Vicariate]] of La Guajira and, as the first vicar, Friar Atanasio Vicente Soler y Royo attempted to "civilize" the Wayuu people.<ref name="lablaa.org">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/modosycostumbres/gumv/gumv07.htm |title=Luis Angel Arango Library: The Capuchins Mission and the Wayuu Culture |access-date=2008-04-01 |language=es |archive-date=2009-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515013053/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/modosycostumbres/gumv/gumv07.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Wayuus in La Guajira 1928.png|thumb|right|200px|Wayuus carrying a rifle and traditional [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow]]. 1928.]]

In 1903, the Capuchin Friars began building orphanages for Wayuu children, beginning with the La Sierrita Orphanage built in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains. The San Antonio Orphanage, located by the [[Calancala River]], was built in 1910, and the Nazareth Orphanage, in the Serranía de Macuira mountains, in 1913. The orphanages had influence over the [[ranchería]]s of Guarrachal, El Pájaro, Carazúa, Guaraguao, Murumana, Garra Patamana, and Karraipía. The Nazareth Orphanage had some control over the rancherías of Taroa, Maguaipa, Guaseipá, and Alpanapause. The friars frequently visited the settlements, inviting the people to attend mass. Wayuu children in the orphanages were educated in traditional European customs. Conflicts between the Wayuu people and the Colombian government have decreased since then. In 1942, [[Uribia]] celebrated Christmas and New Year's Eve for the first time .<ref name="lablaa.org"/>

====Thousand days' civil war====
{{Main|Thousand Days' War}}

During the [[Thousand Days' War]] (1899–1902) the region was affected by the struggle between [[Colombian Liberal Party|liberals]] and [[Colombian Conservative Party|conservatives]]. The indigenous in La Guajira sided with members of either side depending on parental affiliation or economic advantage rather than on political views. A cacique named José Dolores came to an agreement with Liberal radical [[Rafael Uribe Uribe]], but later sided with the conservatives after recognizing a parental affiliation with General Iguarán, one of the conservative commanders.<ref>[http://www.raicespaisas.org/guerra_1000_dias.htm {{in lang|es}} raicespaisas.org: The Thousand Days War; the indigenous] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023211139/http://www.raicespaisas.org/guerra_1000_dias.htm |date=2006-10-23 }}</ref>

==Politics==
{{See also|Politics of Colombia|Government of Colombia}}

The Department of La Guajira is governed by regional equivalents of the three branches of the national government of Colombia. The [[Executive Branch of Colombia|executive branch]] is represented by the [[Governor of the Department of La Guajira]], elected every four years by popular vote in [[Elections in Colombia|regional elections]]; the [[Legislative Branch of Colombia|legislative branch]] by the [[Department Assembly of La Guajira]]; and the judicial branch by the regional courts under the [[Superior Tribunal of Riohacha]] whose members are appointed by the [[Supreme Court of Colombia]]. Control institutions also have their regional representatives. These institutions have control over the 15 municipalities which are governed locally by a mayor, a town council and by the regional courts and control institutions.

===Administrative divisions===
The Department of La Guajira is formed into 15 municipalities, each administered by a popularly elected mayor and a city council, as well as municipal-level courts. 12 of the municipalities are part of a government program called "Special Units for Frontier and Department Frontier Zone": San Juan del Cesar, La Jagua del Pilar, Barrancas, El Molino, Fonseca, Hatonuevo, Maicao, Uribia, Urumita, Villanueva, Manaure, and Riohacha. The municipalities of Dibulla, Albania, and Distracción are excluded from that classification. The Department of La Guajira is also composed of 126 ''[[corregimiento]]s'' (local magistracies), 49 ''inspecciones de policía'' (police districts) and 10 ''caseríos'' (villages), distributed throughout the municipalities.<ref>[http://www.ocaribe.org/downloads/grupos/economia_competitividad/estudio_zif_guajira_venezuela.pdf {{in lang|es}} Observatorio del Caribe Colombiano: Grupo Regional de investigación en economía y competitividad en el Caribe colombiano by Weildler Guerra, Paola Quintero, Jorge Quintero and Ana María Maldonado - Administrative divisions]</ref>

According to the ''[[DANE Colombia|DANE]]'' (Colombian statistics bureau) 2005 Census, 44.9% of the population of the Department of La Guajira was [[indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous]], mostly belonging to the [[Arhuaco]], [[Koguis]], [[Wiwa people|Wiwa]], and [[Wayuu]] tribes. 7.5% was of [[Afro-Colombian]] descent; while the remaining 47.6% of the population did not consider itself part of a particular ethnic group, except for Middle Eastern descendants, who have migrated here throughout the 20th century.<ref name="ReferenceC">[http://www.ocaribe.org/downloads/grupos/economia_competitividad/estudio_zif_guajira_venezuela.pdf {{in lang|es}} Observatorio del Caribe Colombiano: Grupo Regional de investigación en economía y competitividad en el Caribe colombiano by Weildler Guerra, Paola Quintero, Jorge Quintero and Ana María Maldonado - Composicion etnica]</ref>

The department's indigenous population was the largest of any Colombian department (followed by the departments of [[Department of Cauca|Cauca]] and [[Department of Nariño|Narino]] with 18% and 11.2% respectively) and was 20.2% of the national total of indigenous people. The municipalities with the largest indigenous populations were those where the Wayuu people had settled: Uribia (95.9%), Manaure (88.2%), and Maicao (40.1%).<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

The population of 623,250 constituted 1.5% of the total [[demographics of Colombia|population of Colombia]] (42,090,502) and 7% of the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]] (8,910,195). The Department of La Guajira had a population density of 29.9 inhabitants per square kilometer.

[[File:Molino de viento (moderno) 2014-09-21 (3).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jepírachi wind farm in the [[Guajira Peninsula]].]]

The economy of the Department of La Guajira is based on the exploitation of mineral resources, such as [[coal]] in the [[Cerrejón]] mines, natural gas, salt mines in [[Manaure, La Guajira|Manaure]], and constituted 53.48% of total revenues in 2005.<ref name="dnp.gov.co">{{cite web |title=Agenda Interna para la Productividad y la Competitividad |trans-title=Internal Agenda for Productivity and Competitiveness |url=http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Portals/0/archivos/documentos/AgendaInterna/Dimension_Regional/La%20Guajira-copia%20imprenta.pdf |date=June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216111235/http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Portals/0/archivos/documentos/AgendaInterna/Dimension_Regional/La%20Guajira-copia%20imprenta.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2008 |pages=13–14 |publisher=[[National Planning Department (Colombia)|DNP]] |language=es |access-date=15 December 2016}}</ref>

The service industry follows, including electricity, gas, potable water, transport and communications, accounting for 11.06% of the total revenue. Education, health, community service and domestic services account for 9.60% of the total.<ref name="dnp.gov.co"/>

Agriculture, [[silviculture]], and [[fishing]] account for 7.99% of the total, followed by commerce, hotel and restaurant industries which together account for 6.65% of the total revenues.

==Culture==
{{See also|Festivals in La Guajira}}

Cultural aspects in the Department of La Guajira have been mostly influenced by the traditions of the [[Wayuu]]; by European culture, mainly through Roman Catholic traditions; by [[Afro-Colombian]] culture; and since the mid-20th Century, by Middle Eastern culture, including [[Islam]]ic traditions.<ref>[http://www.ocaribe.org/downloads/taller_desigualdades/doc_guajira_perez.htm {{in lang|es}} Colombian Caribbean Observatory - Sistema educativo y realidad en La Guajira: ideas para la armonización intercultural]</ref> There is also considerable influence from Venezuela, as the traditional Wayuu territory is shared by the two nations.

===Language===
There are three main languages in La Guajira, the most widespread is the [[Spanish language]], followed by the [[Wayuu language]]. The growing population of Middle Eastern immigrants has contributed the use of the [[Arabic language]] to the region. Koguis and Wiwas are more associated with the [[Chibchan language]]s, having their own dialect.<ref>[http://www.ocaribe.org/downloads/taller_desigualdades/doc_guajira_perez.htm {{in lang|es}} Colombian Caribbean Observatory: Language in the Department of La Guajira (Sistema educativo y realidad en La Guajira: ideas para la armonización intercultural)]</ref>

Spanish in La Guajira has also developed its own dialect mostly by taking words from the Wayuu language. The Wayuus and other indigenous groups are being given bilingual education in both their native language and Spanish. Numerous software companies such as [[Microsoft]]<ref>[http://www.dest.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/2E57B610-2A4E-433C-A490-B667B8CCB02A/17809/LanguageCulture_LuisEnriqueLopez1.pdf The return to the Indian and the search for cultural responsiveness and responsibility in Latin American education by Luis Enrique López]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]<ref>[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuInWayuunaiki Ubuntu: Ubuntu in Wayuunaiki]</ref> have developed products in the Wayuu language.<ref>[http://www.ocaribe.org/downloads/taller_desigualdades/doc_guajira_perez.htm {{in lang|es}} Colombian Caribbean Observatory: Language in the Department of La Guajira (Sistema educativo y realidad en La Guajira:  ideas para la armonización intercultural)]</ref>

There is also a small yet significant number of English speakers living in the Cerrejón miner's citadel, owing to the bilingual school there.

===Literature===
Literature in La Guajira has been both written in Spanish and Wayuunaiki, most of it describing the myths, the sacred, the tragic, the epics, the legends, heroism, the magic, the comedy, and romanticism autochthonous to the region and directly influenced by the ''[[Costumbrismo]]'', including physiology and sexuality.<ref>[http://colombia.indymedia.org/news/2007/09/72454.php {{in lang|es}} Indymedia.org: Wayuu literature or the Myths adventures by Manuel Guillermo Ortega] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327001355/http://colombia.indymedia.org/news/2007/09/72454.php |date=2008-03-27 }} Sunday, Sep. 23, 2007 at 4:05 PM</ref>

Wayuu tribes feature prominently in ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' by [[Henri Charrière]], which is about an escaped convict who takes refuge with one such tribe. La Guajira has been the subject of numerous writings describing its culture.

===Music===
{{See also|vallenato}}

Music in the Department of La Guajira has been associated with the indigenous peoples, as well as being influenced by the cultures of Afro-Colombians and Europeans. Such is the case of [[vallenato]] music, which allegedly originated in the region between Riohacha and Valledupar, with some considering larger area reaching from Riohacha to the central region of the Department of Cesar. The accordions and guitars first used for vallenato music were allegedly acquired in La Guajira as contraband arriving from the nearby island of [[Aruba]], in the Caribbean Sea.<ref name="Indeterminate">[https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/310/31004202.pdf Taliraai: Music, Gender and Kinship in the Wayuu Culture - Jacqueline Vilchez Faria]</ref>

The Wayuu have contributed their own traditional music and instruments. Their culture associates economy and social life with music, such as in the case of raising cattle, where the indigenous sang to their animals. They also used music for meetings and celebrations, as well as mourning, at funerals. The Yonna is the traditional dance of the Wayuu and is performed to honor guests.<ref name="Indeterminate"/>

The Wayuus created many rustic musical instruments, such as ''Kashi'', ''Sawawa'' (a type of flute), ''ma'asi'', ''totoy'', and the ''taliraai'' (tubular flute), ''wootoroyoi'' (type of clarinet), among others. The ''Majayura'', or ritual of the "young wayuu virgin", in which a female dances towards a male considered a prospective mate, while other males perform rhythms with their traditional instruments, until the one male tumbles to the ground.<ref name="Indeterminate"/>

===Gastronomy===
Gastronomy in the Department of La Guajira is associated with the traditional gastronomy of the indigenous Wayuu, based on local fauna and flora, as well as being influenced by [[Spanish cuisine]]. The most representative of Guajira cuisine is [[friche]] – a fried or stewed goat seasoned with salt and its own blood and guts. There are also ''Arroz con camarones'' – rice with shrimp, where the rice is cooked with previously boiled shrimp and put out to dry in the sun; [[iguana]] stew with [[coconut]]s; ''Iguaraya'' – the fruit of the [[cactus]], which the Wayuus use for drinking juice or wine; and turtles, [[deer]], and [[capybara]]s cooked in a variety of ways, usually with rice, in soup or a stew.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Algunos platos típicos |trans-title=Gastronomy of La Guajira |url=http://www.viajes-exoticos.info/colombia-guajira-gastronomia.php |date=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206221427/http://www.viajes-exoticos.info/colombia-guajira-gastronomia.php |archive-date=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead |website=Viajes-exoticos.info |language=es |access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Manifestaciones locales de la culinaria caribeña |trans-title=Gastronomy of the Caribbean Region of Colombia |url=http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/etnias/1604/article-83278.html |date=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829160251/http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/etnias/1604/article-83278.html |archive-date=29 August 2008 |url-status=dead |website=Colombia Aprende |language=es |access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/geografia/region1/cap9c.htm {{in lang|es}} LABLAA: Listos Ojos, Paladar y Corazon]</ref>
