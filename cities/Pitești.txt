'''Pitești''' ({{IPA|ro|piˈteʃtʲ|audio=LL-Q7913 (ron)-KlaudiuMihaila-Pitești.wav}}) is a city in [[Romania]], located on the river [[Argeș (river)|Argeș]]. The capital and largest city of [[Argeș County]], it is an important commercial and industrial center, as well as the home of two universities. Pitești is situated in the historical region of [[Muntenia]]. It lies on the [[A1 freeway (Romania)|A1 freeway]] connecting the city directly to the national capital [[Bucharest]], being an important railway junction, with a [[classification yard]] in nearby [[Bălilești]]. The city houses the [[Arpechim Refinery|Arpechim oil refinery]], and is a marketing center for the [[Automotive industry in Romania|automotive industry]], in particular, [[Automobile Dacia]].

Inhabited since [[Prehistory of the Balkans|prehistoric times]] but first mentioned in the 14th century, it developed as a trading town in northern [[Wallachia]], serving as an informal residence for various [[Rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Princes]] until the 18th century. From the 19th century and until the interwar period, it was an important political center for the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] and the main residence of the [[Brătianu family]] of politicians. During the early stages of the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist regime]], it was one of the main sites of political repression, with the [[Pitești Prison]] becoming home to an experiment in [[brainwashing]] techniques.

The first recorded mention of Pitești itself was on May 20, 1386, when [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]] granted a [[gristmill]] in the area to [[Cozia Monastery]].<ref name="istoras"/><ref name="gcalin">{{in lang|ro}} Gerard Călin, [http://www.centrul-cultural-pitesti.ro/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=586&Itemid=97 ''Reședința domnească temporară de la Pitești''], at the [http://www.centrul-cultural-pitesti.ro/ Pitești Cultural Center]; retrieved July 17, 2007</ref> Pitești was subsequently one of the temporary residences of Wallachian Princes.<ref name="istoras"/> Due to its positioning on the junction of major European routes (and its proximity to the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] markets in [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]], [[Transylvania]]), the city originally developed as an important commercial center.<ref>[[Andrei Oțetea]], ''The History of the Romanian People'', [[Editura Științifică]], Bucharest, 1970, p.446</ref> By the late 14th century, it became home to a sizable [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian]] community.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305004043/http://www.divers.ro/armeni_scurt_istoric_ro "Armeni - Scurt istoric"], at [http://www.divers.ro/ ''Divers''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421061852/http://www.divers.ro/ |date=2018-04-21 }}; retrieved July 17, 2007</ref>

At the time, the locality was only extending on the left bank of the Argeș, and gradually expanded over the river, reaching the hill slopes to the west<ref name="istoras"/> (in the 19th century, it completely absorbed ''Târgul din Deal'').<ref name="Giurescu, p.47"/> While Pitești was commonly designated as a high-ranking town, a village of Pitești was still mentioned as late as 1528, which led some historians to conclude that the village and urban area coexisted within the same boundaries.<ref name="gcalin"/>

===Early Modern period===

Although princely quarters have not been uncovered, among the rulers to issue documents from Pitești were [[Basarab Țepeluș cel Tânăr]] (1477–1481), [[Neagoe Basarab]] (1512–1521), [[Vlad Înecatul]] (1530–1532), [[Vlad Vintilă de la Slatina]] (1532–1535), [[Michael the Brave]] (1593–1601), [[Simion Movilă]] (1601–1602), [[Matei Basarab]] (1632–1654) and [[Constantin Șerban]] (1654–1658).<ref name="gcalin"/> In addition, [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] (1688–1714), who owned large sections of vineyard in the area, is reported to have spent several seasons in the town.<ref name="gcalin"/>

Under Vlad Vintilă, who allied himself with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against his [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] overlords, [[Aloisio Gritti]] (governor of [[Ottoman Hungary]]) and his Wallachian [[boyar]] partisans camped in the Pitești neighborhood of Războieni, where they were attacked and defeated by the Prince.<ref name="gcalin"/> In 1600–1601, troops of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], led by [[Jan Zamoyski]], were stationed in Pitești during their expedition against Michael the Brave (''see [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]]'').<ref name="gcalin"/><ref name="mpaduraru">{{in lang|ro}} Mariu Păduraru, [http://www.centrul-cultural-pitesti.ro/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=633&Itemid=97 ''Orașul Pitești văzut de călători străini''], at the [http://www.centrul-cultural-pitesti.ro/ Pitești Cultural Center]; retrieved July 17, 2007</ref> Around that time, fighting occurred in and around the town as the new prince [[Radu Șerban]] clashed with the Ottomans and their [[Crimean Khanate]] allies.<ref name="mpaduraru"/>

Constantin Șerban financed the building of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Saint George Church, completed in 1656.<ref name="istoras"/><ref name="gcalin"/> His building program also included a (since-lost) palace and adjacent gardens.<ref name="gcalin"/> Around that time, the city hosted travelers of renown, such as Arab chronicler [[Paul of Aleppo]] and Swedish politician [[Claes Rålamb (1622–1698)|Claes Rålamb]].<ref name="mpaduraru"/> It was during Brâncoveanu's rule that the city was home to ''[[Stolnic]]'' [[Constantin Cantacuzino (stolnic)|Constantin Cantacuzino]], who was exchanging letters with English statesman [[William Paget, 6th Baron Paget|William, Baron Paget]].<ref name="gcalin"/> A tower and other princely houses, built by Brâncoveanu outside the town, gradually deteriorated over the 18th and 19th centuries (the last standing structure was lost in the 20th century).<ref name="gcalin"/> In 1689, [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg]] troops led by [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis William of Baden]] occupied the city as part of the [[Great Turkish War]] (they were repelled later that year).<ref name="mpaduraru"/>

===18th and early 19th centuries===
[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 24.jpg|thumb|Pitești in 1793, etching by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]

In November 1714, as a direct result of Swedish defeats in the [[Great Northern War]] against [[Imperial Russia]], [[List of Swedish monarchs|Swedish King]] [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] unsuccessfully sought an alliance with [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Ahmed III]]; on his way back from [[Istanbul]], Charles and [[Axel Sparre]] passed through Pitești, and, after a three-week stay, made their way to [[Swedish Pomerania]] through Habsburg-ruled regions.<ref name="mpaduraru"/> During the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18|Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718]], Habsburg troops attacked and captured the town; Pitești was again the scene of battles during the [[Austro-Turkish War, 1737–1739|Austro-Turkish War of 1737–1739]].<ref name="mpaduraru"/>

In 1780, [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] numismatist [[Domenico Sestini]] passed through the Argeș region, and described the town as having 250 houses and 7 churches.<ref name="mpaduraru"/> In 1804, the citizens requested to have an upper school opened (to offer lectures in Greek, the educational language of the time); their request was denied by Prince [[Constantine Ypsilantis]].<ref>Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Making of Modern Romanian Culture: Literacy and the Development of National Identity'', I.

The town was an important location for events relating to the last stage of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]] and the first stages of the [[Greek War of Independence]]: it was here that, in late spring 1821, the Wallachian rebel leader [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] settled after retreating from [[Bucharest]]. His departure raised suspicion from his [[Filiki Eteria|Eterist]] allies that he was planning to abandon the common cause. Vladimirescu was captured in the nearby locality of [[Băilești]] and executed soon after, on orders from [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexander Ypsilantis]].<ref>[[William Harrison Ainsworth]], "The Russians in Wallachia", in ''[[The New Monthly Magazine and Humorist]]'', Vol. 91, 1851, p.33 D2</ref>

[[File:Interbelic Pitesti CoA.png|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of Pitești during the interwar period]]

The city was developed further after the [[United Principalities|1859 unification]] of the [[Danubian Principalities]] and the 1881 creation of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]. Around that time, and down to the late interwar, the city became a [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal]] center, largely due to the [[Brătianu family]] of politicians residing in nearby [[Ștefănești, Argeș|Ștefănești]].<ref name="mcraciun">{{in lang|ro}} Mircea Crăciun, [http://revista.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&id=644 ''Relicve din perioada dictaturii comuniste în județul Argeș''], at the [http://revista.memoria.ro/ Memoria Digital Library]; retrieved July 17, 2007</ref> Their manor, ''Florica'', housed most major reunions of the National Liberal leaders.<ref name="mcraciun"/> For a short period in 1882, Pitești was home to dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], leading some to propose that it was the unnamed National Liberal-dominated city depicted in Caragiale's famous play ''[[O scrisoare pierdută]]''.<ref>[[Șerban Cioculescu]], ''Caragialiana'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1974, p.202–203. {{OCLC|6890267}}</ref>

By 1872, a [[Căile Ferate Române|national railway]] connection with the capital Bucharest and [[Târgoviște]] was built, at the same time as one linking Bucharest with [[Ploiești]] through [[Chitila]].<ref name="Giurescu, p.155">Giurescu, p.155</ref> Overseen by the German financier [[Bethel Henry Strousberg]], this was the second project of its kind in Romania (after the Bucharest-[[Giurgiu]] rail link of 1869).<ref name="Giurescu, p.155"/> The Pitești Town Hall was completed in 1886, and currently houses an art gallery.<ref name="istoras"/> The [[Argeș County]] Prefecture, designed by [[Dimitrie Maimarolu]], was erected in 1898–1899 on the site previously occupied by an Orthodox [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]; it is the present-day site of the [[Argeș County Museum|County Museum of History and Natural Sciences]].<ref name="istoras"/> Both buildings are [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] in style, and feature [[fresco]]es painted by [[Iosif Materna]].<ref name="istoras"/>

Pitești experienced urbanization and economic development with several changes in landscape and a number of regional firsts. In 1868–1869, Pitești was the first city in Romania to have a recorded [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] community, formed around [[Michał Belina-Czechowski]], a [[Polish people|Polish]] preacher and former Catholic priest who had returned from the United States (the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church in Romania]] was established only after 1918).<ref>Earl A.

From late autumn 1916 to 1918, during the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|World War I battles]], Pitești was occupied by the troops of the [[Central Powers]]. The city was originally abandoned by the [[Romanian Army]] and taken by the German commander [[August von Mackensen]] as the front stabilized on the [[Olt River]], before Mackensen was able to occupy Bucharest and the entire southern Romania.<ref>[[Pamfil Șeicaru]], ''La Roumanie dans la Grande guerre'', Éditions Minard, Paris, 1968, p.332-334</ref> During the post-war existence of [[Greater Romania]], Pitești became a regional cultural center, notably hosting the 1928–1929 series of the magazine ''[[Kalende]]'' (published in cooperation by literary critics [[Vladimir Streinu]], [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]], and [[Tudor Șoimaru]]).<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Al.

===World War II and communism===
[[File:Pitesti highrise 1970.jpg|thumb|Tower blocks in Pitești, photographed in 1970, shortly after their completion]]

Pitești was affected in various ways by World War II and its [[Romania during World War II|successive regimes]]. After a [[Fascism|fascist]] [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed by the [[Iron Guard]] in late 1940, a bronze bust of former [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|premier]] [[Armand Călinescu]] (whom the Guard had assassinated in September 1939), was chained and dragged through the city streets.<ref>Nicolae Ciobanu, "Armand Călinescu: Jertfă pentru liniștea și independența țării. «Omul de oțel» împotriva Gărzii de Fier", in ''Dosarele Istoriei'', 6/IV (1999), p.60</ref> In December 1943, under the dictatorship of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]] (a Pitești native), it saw the final chapter in a chain of deportations of [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani people]] to [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]'').<ref>[[Dennis Deletant]], ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and His Regime, Romania, 1940–1944'', Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2006, p.191.  {{ISBN|1-4039-9341-6}}</ref> The city was sporadically bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]: on July 4, 1944, it was struck by a section of the US [[Fifteenth Air Force]] (''see [[Bombing of Romania in World War II]]'').<ref>Charles E. Francis, Adolph Caso, ''The [[Tuskegee Airmen]]: The Men Who Changed a Nation'', Branden Books, Wellesley, 1997, p.149. {{ISBN|0-8283-2029-2}}</ref>

In the 1950s, while serving as capital of [[Regiunea Argeș]], Pitești gained an ill notoriety, when the [[Communist Romania|communist authorities]] used the local detention facility to subject political detainees to "[[Reeducation in Communist Romania|reeducation]]", in which violence between inmates was encouraged to the point of being mandatory (''see [[Pitești prison]]''). The experiment was carried out by the [[Securitate]] secret police and overseen by [[Alexandru Nicolschi]]; its goal was to psychologically destroy the capacity for outside attachment and outside loyalty, creating the brainwashed ''New Man'' prototype of [[Leninism]].<ref>Cioroianu, p.317</ref> The program was canceled after some five years. At a trial held in 1953–1954, twenty-two inmate-participants were sentenced, with sixteen being condemned to death for their role in the experiment.<ref>Cioroianu, p.318</ref> In 1957, a new trial convicted certain members of the prison staff, who received light sentences; they were later pardoned.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Teodor Wexler, [http://revista.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&id=419 "Procesul sioniștilor"], in [http://revista.memoria.ro/ ''Memoria'']; retrieved July 17, 2007</ref>

In parallel, Pitești underwent numerous changes in landscape, including the completion of the [[A1 (Romania)|A1 freeway]], the first road of its kind, during the 1960s, and the acceleration of [[industrialization]] with a focus on the chemical and automotive industries. Around 1950, Pitești area accommodated [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] refugees from the [[Greek Civil War]] (some of the buildings erected for this purpose were later used to house resettled peasants).<ref name="mcraciun"/> ''Florica'' was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] in 1948, and was later partly devastated by [[Romanian Communist Party]] activists (for a while during the 1970s, it was a residence of the communist politician [[Ion Dincă]]).<ref name="mcraciun"/> The bust of [[Ion Brătianu]], standing in front of Saint Nicholas Church, was removed and melted, and the church itself was demolished in 1962.<ref name="mcraciun"/>

==Geography==
The city is part of the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of Wallachia, situated in its north and in the westernmost part of its [[Muntenia]]n subregion. It lies on the right bank of the Argeș, where the river meets its tributary, [[Râul Doamnei]].

The population of Pitești grew between the 1830s and the 1990s, with the most sustained period of growth occurring after the 1950s, when industrial development created jobs and attracted residents from nearby settlements. The population peaked at an estimated 187,000 in 1997, then stagnated until 2001, and has gradually decreased since that time. The drop is particularly noticeable among the male population: this segment not only has a higher mortality and lower life expectancy, but also, due to de-industrialization, emigrated in search of work in significant numbers.<ref name="nedeleaPitești">{{cite journal

==Economy==

Pitești is one of the most industrialized cities in Romania. It is the center of the automotive industry in the country: the [[Automobile Dacia]] automaker is situated in the nearby town of [[Mioveni]], and several other automobile parts manufacturers are located within its urban area ([[Dräxlmaier Group]], [[Lear (company)|Lear Corporation]] and [[Valeo]]). The city also houses the [[Arpechim]] oil refinery, part of the [[Petrom]] group. The plant, established as a state-owned company during communism, has traditionally been the center of controversy over its [[air pollution]] records. In 2007, the [[Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development (Romania)|Ministry of the Environment]] withdrew Arpechim's permit, but Petrom contested the decision in court.<ref name="rolarpech">{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/arpechim-reporneste-98068 "Arpechim repornește"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', June 13, 2007</ref> The plant is scheduled to gradually reduce its activity over a period of several years, pending eventual closure.<ref name="rolarpech"/>

The city is surrounded by hills rich in wineries and plum orchards. The latter give one of the finest Romanian ''[[Țuică|țuica]]s'': ''țuica de Pitești''. The Ștefănești winery, situated on the opposite bank of the Argeș River, is one of the best known in Romania.

=== Theatre ===

Pitești is home to a County Theater; established in 1948, it was named in honor of playwright [[Alexandru Davila]] a decade later. Its branches include a [[puppet theater]] (created in 1949), the ''Estrada'' section for open-air performances (1958), and a [[folklore]] section (1970).<ref name="cjateatr">{{in lang|ro}} [http://old.cjarges.ro/upload/atachments/2418_Prezentare%20teatru.pdf ''Teatrul Alexandru Davila''] at the [http://www.cjarges.ro/ Argeș County Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206035211/http://www.cjarges.ro/ |date=2008-02-06 }}; retrieved July 17, 2007</ref> The Theater's Studio 125 was established in May 1975 by director [[Liviu Ciulei]].<ref name="cjateatr"/>

The first written record of a theatrical performance in the city dates to 1848, when [[Constantin Halepliu]] set up a troupe. Following [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|that year's revolution]], several actors, Halepliu included, were arrested, and the theatre closed until 1856. A Communal Theatre was built in 1914–1916. Since 1948, the local acting ensemble has performed both in other Romanian cities and abroad, including in Poland, Serbia, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain.<ref name="cjateatr"/>

=== Education ===
[[File:RO AG - Universitatea din Pitesti (fostul Institutul Pedagogic).jpg|thumb|right|Faculty of Orthodox Theology at the [[University of Pitești]]]]

The city houses two universities: the state-run [[University of Pitești]] and the private [[Constantin Brâncoveanu University]] (founded 1991, with branches in [[Brăila]] and [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]]). There are 17 secondary education institutions, including two main high schools—the [[Ion Brătianu National College (Pitești)|Ion Brătianu National College]] (founded 1866) and the [[Zinca Golescu National College]]. There are also 20 primary schools, 23 kindergartens and 10 nursery schools.<ref>[http://www.primariapitesti.ro/portal/arges/pitesti/portal.nsf/AllByUNID/0DB05668228AE7F4C22572EB001FD2E4?OpenDocument ''General Schools, High Schools, Universities''] at [http://www.primariapitesti.ro/ Pitești City Hall]; retrieved November 21, 2008</ref>

A public library, named after intellectual figure [[Dinicu Golescu]], was planned in 1869 by Paraschiva Stephu, a female member of the upper class, who drew up a will leaving 200 Austrian [[ducat]]s for the purpose of creating a library. The institution became operational in 1880, and a large part of the volumes were bequeathed by historian [[George Ionescu-Gion]] immediately following his death in 1904. His donation included over a thousand books in Romanian, French and Italian.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.cjarges.ro/obj.asp?id=2123 ''Biblioteca Județeană''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011100108/http://www.cjarges.ro/obj.asp?id=2123 |date=2007-10-11 }} at the [http://www.cjarges.ro/ Argeș County Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206035211/http://www.cjarges.ro/ |date=2008-02-06 }}; retrieved July 17, 2007</ref><ref name="bibnat">{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.bibnat.ro/biblioteci.php?id=2601 ''Biblioteca Județeană Argeș "Dinicu Golescu”''] at the [http://www.bibnat.ro/ National Library of Romania]; retrieved July 21, 2015</ref> The library moved into its current headquarters in the city center in 2003.<ref name="bibnat"/>

=== Festivals ===

Each year during springtime, Pitești is host to a festival and fair known as ''Simfonia lalelelor'' (the "Tulip Symphony"). Tulips were introduced locally in 1972–1973, when around 3,000 bulbs brought from [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Oradea]] were planted in its central area, along with other flowers.<ref name="slalele">{{in lang|ro}} [http://simfonialalelelor-pitesti.ro/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=16&Itemid=37 "Istoria lalelelor"], at the [http://simfonialalelelor-pitesti.ro/ ''Simfonia lalelelor''] official site; retrieved March 8, 2008</ref> Pitești consequently acquired a reputation as a tulip-growing area, and the flower-themed festival was first organized by the local authorities in 1978.<ref name="slalele"/> Typically held in the cultural centre building (''Casa Cărții''), the festival also includes folk music performances, international scientific conferences, an art exhibit and youth sport competitions.<ref>[http://www.primariapitesti.ro/portal/arges/pitesti/portal.nsf/AllByUNID/F98AC6ACE66A3857C2257CC900437941?OpenDocument ''Tulip Symphony''] at [http://www.primariapitesti.ro/ Pitești City Hall]; retrieved July 21, 2015</ref>

Pitești is home to an [[Olympic size swimming pool]], the home ground for [[CSM Pitești]], and a public outdoor swimming pool in the Tudor Vladimirescu area. Nearby [[Bascov]] also has a public swimming place, on grounds adjacent to the Budeasa Dam. The national [[canoe racing]] also trains at the Budeasa Dam sports base, and the location is also used for recreational fishing. A [[tennis]] challenger tournament (''Turneul challenger feminin Pitești'') takes place each year, on grounds in Bascov.
