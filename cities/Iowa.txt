==Etymology==
Like [[List of state and territory name etymologies of the United States|many other states]], Iowa takes its name from its predecessor, [[Iowa Territory]], whose name in turn is derived from the [[Iowa River]], and ultimately from the [[ethnonym]] of the indigenous [[Ioway people]].
The Ioway are a [[Chiwere language|Chiwere]]-speaking [[Sioux|Siouan Nation]], who were once part of the [[Ho-Chunk]] Confederation that inhabited the area now corresponding to several [[Midwest]] states. The Ioway were one of the many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] nations whose territory comprised the future state of Iowa before the time of European colonization.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alex, Lynn M. |year=2000 |title=Iowa's Archaeological Past |publisher=University of Iowa Press, Iowa City}}</ref>

===Prehistory===

{{Main|Iowa archaeology|American Indians of Iowa}}
[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|Excavation of the 3,800-year-old [[Edgewater Park Site]]]]

When [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a [[Pleistocene]] glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, Native Americans were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), Native Americans adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name="iaarch" />

More than 3,000 years ago, during the [[Late Archaic period]], Native Americans in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name="iaarch" />

The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous native American tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name="iaarch">Alex, Lynn M.

After the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two parts—the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter. The [[Indiana Territory]], created in 1800, exercised jurisdiction over this portion of the District; [[William Henry Harrison]] was its first governor. Much of Iowa was mapped by [[Zebulon Pike]] in 1805,<ref>Pike (1965): The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to headwaters of the [[Mississippi River]], through [[Louisiana Territory]], and in [[New Spain]], during the years June 7, 1805, Ross & Haines</ref> but it was not until the construction of [[Fort Madison, Iowa|Fort Madison]] in 1808 that the U.S. established tenuous military control over the region.<ref name="mckusick2009">{{cite book|last=McKusick|first=Marshall B.|title=Frontier Forts of Iowa: Indians, Traders, and Soldiers, 1682–1862|editor=William E.

Almost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from Natives, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa", Marcus L. Hansen, ''IJHP'', 19 (April 1921):159–95</ref>

Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The first and second [[Iowa State Fair]]s were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at [[Fairfield, Iowa|Fairfield]]. The first fair was held October 25–27, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held annually since then, except for a few exceptions: 1898 due to the [[Spanish–American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]]; from 1942 to 1945, due to [[World War II]], as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot; and in 2020 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |title=Iowa State Fair |publisher=Trivia |access-date=December 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130160719/http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |archive-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Safety|url=http://www.iowastatefair.org/safety/|access-date=October 13, 2020|website=Iowa State Fair|archive-date=October 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016165113/https://www.iowastatefair.org/safety/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Civil War, 1861–1865===
{{Main article|Iowa in the American Civil War}}
Iowa supported the Union during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], voting heavily for [[Abraham Lincoln]], though there was an antiwar "[[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]]" movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lendt |first=David L. |title=Iowa and the Copperhead Movement |journal=The Annals of Iowa |volume=40 |date=1970 |issue=6 |pages=412–427 |doi=10.17077/0003-4827.7965 |url=https://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/annals-of-iowa/article/id/8482/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220510004833/https://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/annals-of-iowa/article/id/8482/ |archive-date=May 10, 2022 |via=Iowa Research Online|doi-access=free |issn = 0003-4827 }}</ref> There were no battles in the state, although the [[Battle of Athens (1861)|Battle of Athens]], Missouri, 1861, was fought just across the Des Moines River from [[Croton, Iowa]], and shots from the battle landed in Iowa.

Much of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to [[Samuel J. Kirkwood]], its first wartime governor. Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty. Iowa contributed proportionately more soldiers to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were killed before the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] surrendered at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox]].<ref name="Iowa Official Register page 315" />

They marched on General [[Nathaniel Banks]]' ill-starred expedition to the Red River. Twenty-seven [[Iowans]] have been awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, which was first awarded in the Civil War.<ref>Iowa Official Register, Volume No. 60, pages 315–316</ref>

Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals—[[Grenville Mellen Dodge]], [[Samuel R. Curtis]], [[Francis J. Herron]], and [[Frederick Steele]]—and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.<ref name="Iowa Official Register page 315" />

===Agricultural expansion, 1865–1930===
Following the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860<ref>[https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1864/dec/1860a.html "1860 Census: Population of the United States"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121165007/https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1864/dec/1860a.html |date=January 21, 2021 }}.

In 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war.<ref name="ec-ag" /> In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change.

===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930–1985===

The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The [[Great Depression]] and World War II accelerated the shift away from [[smallholding|smallholder]] farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The period after World War II witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|website=publications.iowa.gov|last=Schwieder|first=Dorothy|access-date=April 20, 2020|archive-date=September 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903191039/http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1975, Governor Robert D. Ray petitioned President Ford to allow Iowa to accept and resettle [[Tai Dam]] refugees fleeing the Indochina War.<ref>Walsh, Matthew. ''The Good Governor: Robert Ray and the Indochinese Refugees of Iowa'' (McFarland & Co, 2017)</ref> An exception was required for this resettlement as State Dept policy at the time forbid resettlement of large groups of refugees in concentrated communities; an exception was ultimately granted and 1200 Tai Dam were resettled in Iowa.

===Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985–present===

After bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to reduce its dependence on agriculture.

{{main|Environment of Iowa}}
[[Image:Landforms of Iowa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Landforms of Iowa]]

Iowa's natural vegetation is [[tallgrass prairie]] and [[savanna]] in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas.<ref name=Prior91 /> Most of Iowa is used for agriculture; crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.<ref>Iowa DNR: Iowa's Statewide Land Cover Inventory, [http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/landcvr/landcvr.htm Uiowa.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502010333/http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/landcvr/landcvr.htm |date=May 2, 2009 }}</ref>

Virtually statewide, the driest month is January or February, and the wettest month is June owing to frequent showers and thunderstorms some of which produce hail, damaging winds or tornadoes.

Iowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]), is feeling the brunt of [[rural flight]], although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990.

==Law and government==
===State===

[[File:Iowa State Capitol - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Iowa State Capitol]] in Des Moines, completed in 1886, is the only state capitol in the United States to feature five domes, a central golden dome surrounded by four smaller ones. It houses the [[Iowa General Assembly]], comprising the [[Iowa House of Representatives]] and [[Iowa Senate]].]]
[[File:Iowa Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|The [[Iowa Supreme Court]], across from the capitol, is the state's highest court.]]

{{As of|2022}}, the 43rd and current [[Governor of Iowa]] is [[Kim Reynolds]] (R). Other statewide elected officials are:
* [[Adam Gregg]] (R), [[List of lieutenant governors of Iowa|Lieutenant Governor]]
* [[Paul Pate]] (R), [[Secretary of State of Iowa|Secretary of State]]
* [[Rob Sand]] (D), [[Auditor of State of Iowa|Auditor of State]]
* [[Roby Smith]] (R), [[Treasurer of State of Iowa|Treasurer of State]]
* [[Mike Naig]] (R), [[Secretary of Agriculture of Iowa|Secretary of Agriculture]] 
* [[Brenna Bird]] (R), [[Attorney General of Iowa|Attorney General]]

The [[Code of Iowa]] contains Iowa's [[statutory law]]s. It is periodically updated by the Iowa Legislative Service Bureau, with a new edition published in odd-numbered years and a supplement published in even-numbered years.

Iowa is an alcohol monopoly or [[alcoholic beverage control state]].

===National===

{{Further|List of United States Senators from Iowa|List of United States Representatives from Iowa}}

The two U.S. Senators:
* [[Chuck Grassley]] (R), in office since 1981
* [[Joni Ernst]] (R), in office since 2015

The four U.S. Representatives:
* [[Mariannette Miller-Meeks]] (R), [[Iowa's 1st congressional district|First district]]
* [[Ashley Hinson]] (R), [[Iowa's 2nd congressional district|Second district]]
* [[Zach Nunn]] (R), [[Iowa's 3rd congressional district|Third district]]
* [[Randy Feenstra]] (R), [[Iowa's 4th congressional district|Fourth district]]

After the [[2010 United States Census]] and the resulting redistricting, Iowa lost one seat in Congress, falling to four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Incumbent U.S. Representatives [[Leonard Boswell]] (D) and [[Tom Latham (politician)|Tom Latham]] (R) ran against each other in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa, 2012|2012]] in the third congressional district which had new boundaries; Latham won and retired after the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa, 2014|2014 elections]]. King represented the old [[Iowa's 5th congressional district|fifth congressional district]].

===Political parties===

In Iowa, the term "political party" refers to political organizations which have received two percent or more of the votes cast for president or governor in the "last preceding general election". Iowa recognizes three political parties—the [[Republican Party of Iowa|Republican Party]], the [[Iowa Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], and the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Forming a Political Party in Iowa |url=https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/electioninfo/formpoliticalparty.html |website=sos.iowa.gov |publisher=Iowa Secretary of State Paul D.

As a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the [[Iowa General Assembly]]: the House had a Republican majority, while the Senate had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senate. Incumbent Democratic governor [[Chet Culver]] was defeated in 2010 by Republican [[Terry Branstad]], who had served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in U.S. history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3{{nbsp}}days; eclipsing [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], who served 21 years until 1804.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/14/meet-iowa-gov-terry-branstad-who-as-of-monday-is-americas-longest-serving-governor/|title=Terry Branstad just became the longest serving governor in American history|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=September 14, 2016|archive-date=September 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919170235/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/14/meet-iowa-gov-terry-branstad-who-as-of-monday-is-americas-longest-serving-governor/|url-status=live}}</ref> Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds succeeded him on May 24, 2017, following Branstad's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to China.

In previous eras, Democratic and Republican parties had a balance in state politics and federal representation. By 2024, the two became dominated by the Republican Party. Factors include younger people leaving for more urbanized, more Democratic-leaning states, as well as homogenization of rural voters in the Midwest and in other regions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/us/politics/iowa-republicans-red.html|title=Why Iowa Turned So Red When Nearby States Went Blue|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2024-01-08|access-date=2024-09-12}}</ref>

===Presidential caucus===
{{Main|Iowa caucuses}}

The state gets considerable attention every four years because the [[Iowa caucus]], gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. The caucuses, held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a [[presidential primary]] election.<ref>{{Cite web |author1=James Q.

In the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the first decision of the [[Iowa Supreme Court]]—''In Re the Matter of Ralph'',<ref>1 Morris 1 (Iowa 1839)</ref> decided July 1839—the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War.<ref name="civil rights">{{cite web|url=http://www.judicial.state.ia.us/Public_Information/Iowa_Courts_History/Civil_Rights/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505082508/http://www.judicial.state.ia.us/Public_Information/Iowa_Courts_History/Civil_Rights/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 5, 2006 |title=Early Civil Rights Cases |publisher=Judicial.state.ia.us |access-date=July 26, 2010 }}</ref> The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban [[Anti-miscegenation laws|miscegenation statutes]] nationwide.<ref name="ChicagoTrib">[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-defending-iowa-web,0,2979128.story Gay marriage and Iowa: Why's everyone so surprised?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429060425/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-defending-iowa-web,0,2979128.story |date=April 29, 2009 }}, [[Chicago Tribune]], April 10, 2009</ref>

The Iowa Supreme Court decided ''Clark v.

In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: "All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement."

====Women's rights====

As with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/iowa-and-the-19th-amendment.htm|title=Iowa and the 19th Amendment (U.S. National Park Service)|website=Nps.gov|access-date=January 21, 2020|archive-date=July 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704043145/https://www.nps.gov/articles/iowa-and-the-19th-amendment.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1847, the [[University of Iowa]] became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis.<ref>About Iowa, [http://www.uiowa.edu/homepage/about-UI/index.html Uiowa.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119042543/http://www.uiowa.edu/homepage/about-UI/index.html |date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting [[Arabella A.
