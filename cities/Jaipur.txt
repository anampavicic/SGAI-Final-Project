=== Climate ===
Jaipur has a monsoon-influenced [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh'') with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm winters. Annual precipitation is over {{convert|625|mm|in|0|disp=or}}, falling mostly in July and August due to the southwest monsoon, causing the average temperatures in these two months to be lower compared to drier May and June. During the monsoon, there are frequent, heavy rains and thunderstorms, but flooding is not common. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|49.0|C|1}}, on 23 May 1994. The city's average temperature remains below {{convert|20|C|disp=or}} between December and February. These months are mild, dry, and pleasant, sometimes chilly. The lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-2.2|C|1}} on 31 January 1905, 1 February 1905 and 16 January 1964. Jaipur, like many other major cities of the world, is a significant [[urban heat island]] zone with surrounding rural temperatures occasionally falling below freezing in winters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/066/c00531.htm|title=World Weather Information Service|access-date=11 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128183949/http://www.worldweather.org/066/c00531.htm|archive-date=28 November 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>
