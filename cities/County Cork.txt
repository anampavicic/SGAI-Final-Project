'''County Cork''' ({{langx|ga|Contae Chorcaí}}) is the largest and the southernmost [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], named after the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], the state's second-largest city. It is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]] and the [[Southern Region, Ireland|Southern Region]]. Its largest market towns are [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]], [[Macroom]], [[Midleton]], and [[Skibbereen]]. {{As of | 2022}}, the county had a population of 584,156, making it the third-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county in Ireland. [[Cork County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county, while [[Cork City Council]] governs the city of Cork and its environs. Notable Corkonians include [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Jack Lynch]], [[Roy Keane]], [[Sonia O'Sullivan]], [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Graham Norton]].

Cork borders four other counties: [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. The county contains a section of the [[Golden Vale]] pastureland that stretches from [[Kanturk]] in the north to [[Allihies]] in the south. The south-west region, including [[West Cork]], is one of Ireland's main tourist destinations,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/tourism-ireland-4-3506617-Jul2017/ |newspaper=TheJournal.ie |title=Ireland's most popular tourist counties and attractions have been revealed |date=23 July 2017 |access-date=15 October 2017 |quote="the southwest, comprising Cork and Kerry, has the second-largest spend by tourists [after the Dublin region]" |archive-date=15 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015202253/http://www.thejournal.ie/tourism-ireland-4-3506617-Jul2017/ |url-status=live}}</ref> known for its rugged coast and [[megalithic monument]]s and as the starting point for the [[Wild Atlantic Way]]. The largest third-level institution is [[University College Cork]], founded in 1845, and has a total student population of around 22,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ucc.ie/en/international/ |title=International Office |access-date=3 August 2021 |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813133025/https://www.ucc.ie/en/international/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Local industry and employers include technology company [[Dell EMC]], the European headquarters of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and the farmer-owned dairy co-operative [[Dairygold]].

The county is known as the "rebel county", a name given to it by King [[Henry VII of England]] for its support, in a futile attempt at a rebellion in 1491, of [[Perkin Warbeck]], who claimed to be [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]].

==Political and governance==
The local government areas of county Cork and the city of Cork are administered by the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authorities]] of [[Cork County Council]] and [[Cork City Council]] respectively. The boundary between these two areas was altered by the [[2019 Cork boundary change]]. It is part of the [[Southern Region, Ireland|Southern Region]] and has five representatives on the [[Southern Regional Assembly]].<ref name=si573>{{cite ISB |year=2014 |type=si |number=573 |name=Local Government Act 1991 (Regional Assemblies) (Establishment) Order 2014 |date=16 December 2014 |access-date=14 March 2022}}</ref>

For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the city and county are divided into five constituencies: [[Cork East (Dáil constituency)|Cork East]], [[Cork North-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork North-Central]], [[Cork North-West (Dáil constituency)|Cork North-West]], [[Cork South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork South-Central]] and [[Cork South-West (Dáil constituency)|Cork South-West]]. Together they return 18 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.<ref>{{cite ISB |year=2017 |number=39 |schedule=y |name=[[Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2017]] |date=23 December 2017 |access-date=10 January 2022}}</ref> It is part of the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]].<ref>{{cite ISB |year=2019 |number=7 |section=7 |stitle=Substitution of Third Schedule to Principal Act |name=European Parliament Elections (Amendment) Act 2019 |date=12 March 2019 |access-date=10 January 2022}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Wedge tomb, [[Glantane East]]]]
Cork is the [[List of Irish counties by area|largest county]] in Ireland by land area, and the largest of Munster's six counties by population and area. At the latest census in 2022, the population of the entire county stood at 584,156. Cork is the second-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county in the State, and the third-most populous county on the island of Ireland.

County Cork is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]], bordering [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. The county shares separate mountainous borders with Tipperary and Kerry. The terrain on the Kerry border was formed between 360 and 374 million years ago, as part of the rising of the [[MacGillycuddy's Reeks]] and [[Caha Mountains]] mountains ranges. This occurred during the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] when Ireland was part of a larger continental landmass and located south of the [[equator]].{{sfn|Bourke|Hayden|Lynch|O'Sullivan|2011|p=3}}{{sfn|Site Management Plan}} The region's topography of peaks and valleys are characterised by steep ridges formed during the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian]] period of [[Fold (geology)|folding]] and [[mountain formation]] some 300 million years ago.{{sfn|Bourke|Hayden|Lynch|O'Sullivan|2011|p=3}}

Twenty-four historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] are in the county—the most of any county in [[List of baronies of Ireland|Ireland]]. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}} The county has 253 civil parishes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Cork&streets=no |title=Placenames Database of Ireland. Retrieved January 21, 2012 |publisher=Logainm.ie |date=13 December 2010 |access-date=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708105535/http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Cork&streets=no |archive-date=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland, with about 5447 townlands in the county.

===Mountains and upland habitats===
[[File:Beara Way - geograph.org.uk - 263663.jpg|thumb|The Beara pass, through the Slieve Miskish mountains]]
The county's mountains rose during a period [[mountain formation]] some 374 to 360&nbsp;million years ago and include the [[Slieve Miskish Mountains|Slieve Miskish]] and [[Caha Mountains]] on the [[Beara Peninsula]], the [[Ballyhoura Mountains]] on the border with Limerick and the [[Shehy Mountains]] which contain [[Knockboy]] (706 m), the highest point in Cork. The [[Shehy Mountains]] are on the border with Kerry and may be accessed from the area known as Priests Leap, near the village of Coomhola. The upland areas of the [[Ballyhoura Mountains|Ballyhoura]], [[Boggeragh Mountains|Boggeragh]], [[Derrynasaggart Mountains|Derrynasaggart]], and [[Mullaghareirk Mountains|Mullaghareirk Mountain]] ranges add to the range of habitats found in the county. Important habitats in the uplands include blanket bog, heath, glacial lakes, and upland grasslands. Cork has the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|13th-highest]] county peak in Ireland.

===Rivers and lakes===
[[File:Loch an Ghleanna Bhig (Glenbeg Lough) - geograph.org.uk - 263779.jpg|thumb|left|[[Glenbeg Lough]], [[Beara Peninsula]]]]
[[File:Three Castle Head Upper Lake 2009 09 10.jpg|thumb|left|Upper lake at Three Castle Head, Mizen Head]]
Three rivers, the [[River Bandon|Bandon]], [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]], and [[River Lee (Ireland)|Lee]], and their valleys dominate central Cork.{{original research inline|date=July 2017}} Habitats of the valleys and floodplains include woodlands, marshes, fens, and species-rich limestone grasslands. The River Bandon flows through several towns, including [[Dunmanway]] to the west of the town of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] before draining into Kinsale Harbour on the south coast. Cork's sea loughs include [[Lough Hyne]] and [[Lough Mahon]], and the county also has many small lakes. An area has formed where the River Lee breaks into a network of channels weaving through a series of wooded islands, forming 85 hectares of swampland around Cork's wooded area. The Environmental Protection Agency carried out a survey of surface waters in County Cork between 1995 and 1997, which identified 125 rivers and 32 lakes covered by the regulations.

===Land and forestry===
Like many parts of Munster, Cork has fertile agricultural land and many bog and peatlands. Cork has around 74,000 hectares of peatlands, which amount to 9.8% of the county's total land area. Cork has the highest share of the national forest area, with around {{cvt|90020|ha|acre}} of forest and woodland area, constituting 11.6% of the national total and approximately 12% of Cork's land area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/65294-irelands-national-forest-inventory/ |title=National Forestry Inventory, Third Cycle 2017 |work=DAFM |date=17 November 2020 |access-date=30 July 2021 |archive-date=20 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620124029/https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/65294-irelands-national-forest-inventory/ |url-status=live}}</ref> It is home to one of the last remaining pieces of native woodland in Ireland and Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baraniuk |first=Chris |title=What would a truly wild Ireland look like? |url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210211-rewilding-can-ireland-regrow-its-wilderness |access-date=18 February 2021 |website=BBC |language=en |archive-date=17 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210217105438/https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210211-rewilding-can-ireland-regrow-its-wilderness |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Wildlife===
The [[hooded crow]], ''Corvus cornix'' is a common bird, particularly in areas nearer the coast. Due to this bird's ability to (rarely) prey upon small lambs, the gun clubs of County Cork have killed many of these birds in modern times.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009.

===Coastline===
{{See also|List of islands of Ireland}}
Cork has a mountainous and flat landscape with many beaches and sea cliffs along its coast. The southwest of Ireland is known for its peninsulas and some in Cork include the [[Beara Peninsula]], [[Sheep's Head]], [[Mizen Head]], and [[Brow Head]]. Brow Head is the most southerly point of mainland [[Ireland]]. There are many islands off the coast of the county, in particular, off [[West Cork]]. [[Carbery's Hundred Isles]] are the islands around Long Island Bay and Roaringwater Bay.

[[Fastnet Rock]] lies in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] 11.3&nbsp; km south of mainland Ireland, making it the most southerly point of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Many notable islands lie off Cork, including [[Bere Island|Bere]], [[Great Island]], [[Sherkin Island|Sherkin]], and [[Cape Clear Island|Cape Clear]]. With an estimated {{cvt|1199|km|0}} of coastline, Cork is one of three counties which claims to have the [[List of Irish counties by coastline|longest coastline in Ireland]], alongside [[County Mayo|Mayo]] and [[County Donegal|Donegal]].<ref name=i2>{{cite web |url=https://www.heritagecouncil.ie/content/files/irish_coastal_habitats_impacts_conservation_areas_1998_2mb.pdf |title=Irish Coastal Habitats: A Study of Impacts on Designated Conservation Areas |website=heritagecouncil.ie |publisher=Heritage Council |access-date=6 May 2020 |archive-date=3 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203160047/https://www.heritagecouncil.ie/content/files/irish_coastal_habitats_impacts_conservation_areas_1998_2mb.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=i3>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayococo.ie/en/media/Media,32613,en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728231511/http://www.mayococo.ie/en/media/Media,32613,en.pdf |archive-date=28 July 2020 |url-status=live |title=Mayo County Council Climate Adaptation Strategy |website=mayococo.ie |publisher=Mayo County Council |access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://research.thea.ie/bitstream/handle/20.500.12065/1521/Collins%2C%20Anthony%201996.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y |title=Managing the Donegal Coast in the Twenty-first Century |website=research.thea.ie |publisher=[[Institute of Technology, Sligo]] |access-date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=13 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713101438/https://research.thea.ie/bitstream/handle/20.500.12065/1521/Collins,%20Anthony%201996.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y |url-status=live}}</ref> Cork is also one of just three counties to border two bodies of water – the [[Celtic Sea]] to the south and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west.

The county is colloquially referred to as "The Rebel County", although uniquely Cork does not have an official motto. This name has 15th-century origins, but from the 20th century, the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-Treaty stronghold during the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the [[Kingdom of Desmond|Kingdom of ''Deas Mumhan'']] (South [[Munster]]), anglicised as the [[Kingdom of Desmond|"Desmond"]], ruled by the [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthy Mór dynasty]]. After the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and [[County Kerry]]. [[Dunlough Castle]], standing just north of [[Mizen Head]], is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (AD 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], who became the [[Earls of Desmond]]. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in [[1318 in Ireland|1318]] and for many centuries was an outpost for [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] of 1569–1573 and 1579–1583. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]]. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the [[Plantation of Munster]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Perkin Warbeck.jpg|thumb|left|140px|15th-century drawing of Perkin Warbeck]]
In [[1491 in Ireland|1491]] Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]], a pretender to the English throne spread the story that he was really [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York|Richard of Shrewsbury]] (one of the [[Princes in the Tower]]), landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow King [[Henry VII of England]]. The Cork people supported Warbeck because he was Flemish and not English; Cork was the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England, but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel county' (and Cork city's of the 'rebel city') originates in these events.<ref>{{cite web |title=If not for collins, why is it called the rebel county? |url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/if-not-for-collins-why-is-it-called-the-rebel-county-29469436.html |access-date=28 June 2020 |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=4 August 2013 |archive-date=5 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705003707/https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/if-not-for-collins-why-is-it-called-the-rebel-county-29469436.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=O'Shea |first=Joe |date=21 May 2019 |title=Why is Cork called the Rebel County? |url=https://www.corkbeo.ie/news/history/real-reason-cork-called-rebel-16323863 |access-date=28 June 2020 |website=Cork Beo |archive-date=28 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200628112045/https://www.corkbeo.ie/news/history/real-reason-cork-called-rebel-16323863 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1601 the decisive [[Siege of Kinsale|Battle of Kinsale]] took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. [[Kinsale]] had been the scene of a landing of Spanish troops to help Irish rebels in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594–1603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older [[Kingdom of Desmond|County Desmond]] in 1606.

In the early 17th century, the [[townland]] of Leamcon (near [[Schull]]<ref name=Senior>{{cite book |last=Senior |first=Clive M. |date=1976 |title=A Nation of Pirates |url=https://archive.org/details/a-nation-of-pirates-clive-senior |location=[[Newton Abbot]] |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |isbn=0-7153-7264-5}}</ref>{{rp|41, 68}}) was a [[pirate haven|pirate stronghold]], and [[pirate]]s traded easily in [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]] and [[Whiddy Island]].<ref name=Senior/>{{rp|54–57}}

[[File:Michael Collins.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], photographed in 1919]]
In the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Fenians]] and for the constitutional [[Irish nationalism|nationalism]] of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], from 1910 that of the [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921). Three Cork Brigades of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] in November 1920 and the [[Crossbarry Ambush]] in March 1921. The activity of IRA [[flying column]]s, such as the one under [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] in west Cork, was popularised in the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes The Barley]]''. On 11 December 1920, [[The Burning of Cork|Cork City centre was gutted by fires]] started by the [[Black and Tans]] in reprisal for IRA attacks. Over 300 buildings were destroyed; many other towns and villages around the county, including [[Fermoy]], suffered a similar fate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rebelcork.com/ |title=Rebelcork.com |publisher=Rebelcork.com |access-date=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402070746/http://www.rebelcork.com/ |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23), most of the IRA units in Cork sided against the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called [[Munster Republic]]. However, Cork was taken by troops of the [[Irish Free State]] in August 1922 in the [[Irish Free State offensive]], which included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a key figure in the War of Independence, was born near [[Clonakilty]] and assassinated during the civil war in [[Béal na Bláth]], both in west Cork.

==Irish language==
County Cork has two [[Gaeltacht]] areas in which the [[Irish language]] is the primary medium of everyday speech. These are {{lang|ga|Múscraí}} ([[Muskerry]]) in the north of the county, especially the villages of {{lang|ga|Cill Na Martra}} ([[Kilnamartyra]]), {{lang|ga|Baile Bhúirne}} ([[Ballyvourney]]), {{lang|ga|Cúil Aodha}} ([[Coolea]]), {{lang|ga|Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh}} ([[Ballingeary]]), and {{lang|ga|Oileán Chléire}} ([[Cape Clear Island]]).
