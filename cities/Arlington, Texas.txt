==History==
{{For timeline}}
European settlement in the Arlington area dates back at least to the 1840s. After the May 24, 1841 battle between Texas General [[Edward H. Tarrant]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the Village Creek settlement, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Spring in present-day Arlington (historical marker at {{coord|32|42.136|N|97|6.772|W|type:landmark}}).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Village Creek Historical Summary|url=http://www.forttours.com/pages/villagecreek.asp|access-date=2020-10-26|website=www.forttours.com}}</ref> The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several agriculture-related businesses were well established by the late nineteenth century.

Arlington was founded in 1876 along the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]].<ref name=":1">{{Handbook of Texas|id=hja13|name=Arlington, Texas}}</ref> Named after [[Robert E. Lee|General Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].,<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Arlington, Texas|url=https://downtownarlington.org/about/history|access-date=2020-10-26|website=downtownarlington.org}}</ref> Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated on April 21, 1884.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arlingtontx.gov/UserFiles/Servers/Server_14481062/File/City%20Hall/Depts/Office%20of%20Strategic%20Initiatives/Landmark%20Preservation%20Commission/Historic_Preservation_Plan.pdf |title=Preservation plan |year=2014 |website=arlingtontx.gov }}</ref> The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a public school system.

[[File:Arlington Mineral Well, Arlington, Tex (20088440).jpg|thumb|left|Postcard of the Arlington mineral well, 1914]]

From 1892 until 1951, a mineral well drilled exactly in the middle of downtown Arlington, Texas, was a key reason to visit the town.<ref name=":1" /> The water was part of the city's brand, also serving as a meeting point for everything from prohibition to the right of women to vote. The well has been paved over.

In the 1920s and 1930s, life in Arlington was bustling with controversy and entertainment. In the early 1920s, a tea room known as "Top O' Hill Terrace" opened up along the now-defunct [[Bankhead Highway]] to serve dinner and tea to guests traveling through Dallas and Fort Worth.<ref name="Top O' Hill Terrace History" /> Ownership changed in the late 1920s and shortly thereafter the facilities were secretly converted into casinos and a speakeasy. Known by historians as "Vegas before Vegas", escape tunnels and secret rooms were constructed to hide the [[Gambling in Texas|illegal gambling]] during police raids. However, the restaurant portion of the facility still existed as a legitimate business and a front.<ref name="Top O' Hill Terrace History">{{cite web|url=https://www.topohillterrace.com|title=Top O' Hill Terrace History|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Myers, Noyes, & Forrest Official Map Arlington, Texas 1926 UTA.jpg|thumb|left|1926 map of Arlington]]

By 1925 the city's population was estimated at 3,031—well under the population of Dallas and Fort Worth at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=US. Census Bureau Statistical Information|url=https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/1998/demo/POP-twps0027.html|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref> In 1929, a horse-racing track called Arlington Downs was constructed by W.T. Waggoner and Brian Nyantika close by to the speakeasy. Gambling was still illegal, but people were making bets regardless. Waggoner and his sons campaigned to make [[parimutuel betting]] legal, and in 1933 the state issued its first legal gambling permit to Arlington Downs. The track was immensely profitable at that point, making a daily average of $113,000 before inflation with a daily attendance average of 6,700 people. At the end of the 1937 season, the state legislature repealed their parimutuel gambling laws, and the Downs were sold to commercial developers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/xva02|title=Arlington Down Racetrack|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref>

In the 1940s, the Arlington Downs was used as a rodeo and event venue. Top O' Hill Terrace evaded the police until 1947, when famous [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] M. T. "Lone Wolf" Gonzaullas caught the gambling operation in full-swing and had the place shut down.<ref name="Top O' Hill Terrace History" /> The 1940s brought [[World War II]] to the forefront of the United States, and many families from around Texas moved to Arlington to find jobs. Before World War II, the city's population had grown to over 4,000. The war kick-started a manufacturing revolution in Texas. Arlington was between the biggest aerospace engineering hubs in Texas at the time, Dallas and Fort Worth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dzm01|title=Manufacturing Industry|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref>

In 1956, the Top O' Hill Terrace property was purchased by the Bible Baptist Seminary and converted into what is now [[Arlington Baptist University]]. The underground tunnels and original structures are still standing. In 1958, the Arlington Downs was completely destroyed by commercial developers. All that is left is an original concrete water trough and a Texas historical landmark marker placed in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanracehorse.com/texas-arlington-downs-racetrack-to-be-recognized-with-historical-marker/|title=Texas Arlingtn Downs Racetrack to be Recognized with Historical Marker|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref> Large-scale industrialization began in 1954 with the arrival of a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] [[Arlington Assembly|assembly plant]]. [[Automotive]] and [[aerospace]] development gave the city one of the nation's greatest population growth rates between 1950 and 1990.

Arlington became one of the "[[boomburb]]s", the extremely fast-growing [[suburbs]] of the post-World War II era. [[U.S. Census Bureau]] population figures for the city date the population boom: 7,692 (1950), 90,229 (1970), 261,721 (1990), 365,438 (2010)<ref>{{cite web|title=DP-1 'Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010' with '2010 Demographic Profile Data'|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212055711/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|publisher=U.

On January 13, 1996, a 9-year-old girl, Amber Hagerman, was abducted in Arlington and found murdered four days later. No one has been arrested or convicted for her murder as of 2024. The case led to the creation of the [[Amber Alert]] system.

In October 2019, Arlington was chosen out of several major U.S. cities to become the permanent home of the $150&nbsp;million National Medal of Honor Museum. Construction of the museum is set to be completed in 2024.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fox4news.com/news/national-medal-of-honor-museum-to-be-built-in-arlington|title=National Medal of Honor Museum to be built in Arlington|publisher=Fox|date=October 3, 2019|last1=Paredez|first1=Ashley|last2=Nguyen|first2=Lynnanne|access-date=January 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/arlington-gets-national-medal-of-honor-museum|title=Arlington Gets National Medal of Honor Museum|publisher=Dallas Cowboys|date=October 4, 2019|access-date=January 6, 2021}}</ref>

The Dallas Cowboys rent AT&T Stadium from the City of Arlington for $167,500 per month over a thirty-year period, a sum far less than market value; in exchange, the Cowboys have complete control over the facility's calendar and the revenues collected therefrom, including naming rights, billboard advertising, concession sales and most of the surrounding parking.

Additionally, Arlington has four transit services targeting individual demographic groups: "Handitran" serves senior citizens and disabled people; Arlington hotels pay for a tourist-oriented shuttle-bus system for their guests; The University of Texas at Arlington runs a limited shuttle service for college students; and lastly Mission Arlington, an Arlington-run charity serving the severely indigent, has a bus service that circulates people needing social services or transportation to employment.

The city is served by two Interstate Highways, [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]], also known as [[Ronald Reagan]] Memorial Highway, and [[Interstate 30 in Texas|I-30]], also named [[Tom Landry]] Memorial Highway. Other limited-access freeways include [[Texas State Highway 360|State Highway 360]], which is named for the founder of [[Six Flags Over Texas]], [[Angus G. Wynne]], running along the eastern border, and [[U.S. Route 287 in Texas|U.S. Highway 287]], which traverses the southwestern portion of the city. In most cases, the memorial names are not used in reference to these roadways.
The city also has a tollway, The 360 Tollway, which connects Mansfield to Arlington and Grand Prairie. The tollway is also known as the Rosa Parks Memorial Parkway, named after the civil rights activist. Near US-287, where the tollway ends, the tollway is also named "Senator Chris Harris Memorial Highway"  after the local legislator who aided the extension.

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] now owns and operates the original Texas and Pacific (later [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]]) transcontinental right-of-way and rail route through Arlington (parallel to which the Interurban originally ran); it offers no passenger stops in Arlington, its Arlington freight service is primarily to the local General Motors assembly plant, and most of its lengthy and numerous freight trains are merely passing through town to and from points far away.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=eqt08|name=Texas and Pacific Railway}}</ref><ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=eqm06|name=Missouri Pacific System}}</ref>
