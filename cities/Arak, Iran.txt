==Etymology==
===Arâk===
The term ''Arâk'' remains from a name given to the region since the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]]. It derives from [[Arabic]] ''[[wikt:Iraq|al-ʿIrāq]]'', meaning "root",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boesch|first=Hans H.|title=El-'Iraq|journal=Economic Geography|date=1 October 1939|volume=15|issue=4|page=329|doi=10.2307/141771|jstor=141771}}</ref> itself derived possibly from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''[[Uruk]]'' ({{langx|he|אֶרֶךְ}}, ''Erech''). But new research has shown that the word Arak has the same roots with the words [[Iran (word)|Iran]] and [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], and the name Iraq is an Arabicized [[Persian language|Persian]] word.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nourai|first=Ali|title=An Etymological Dictionary of Persian, English and other Indo-European Languages|pages=15}}</ref>

During the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] era, a region comprising the whole territory of [[Media (region)|Media]] (northwestern Iran) and the lower part of [[Mesopotamia]] was referred to as ''Iraq''; with the Median part called ''ʿErâq-e ʿAjam'' ("Iraq of the [[Ajam]] [non-Arabic speakers]"), and the Mesopotamian part called ''ʿErâq-e ʿArab'' ("Iraq of the [[Arab]]").<ref>C. Edmund Bosworth, {{cite web |title=ʿERĀQ-E ʿAJAM(Ī) |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eraq-e-ajami |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}</ref>

===Soltân Âbâd===
The term ''Soltân Âbâd'' is a [[Persian language|Persian]] compound word.

''[[Sultan|Soltân]]'', deriving from Arabic ''[[wikt:سلطان#Arabic|sulṭān]]'' ("power", "authority"), is a [[Near East]]ern [[Royal and noble ranks|noble title]] given to a powerful governor. [[Persian language|Modern Persian]] ''[[wikt:آباد|âbâd]]'', meaning "settlement" or "abode", derives from [[Middle Persian]] ''[[wikt:ʾp̄ʾt'|āpāt]]'' ("populous"). However, according to linguist Sasha Lubotsky, the Persian term ''ābād'' might derive from [[Proto-Iranian]] ''*āpāta'' ("protected"), rooting from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/peh₂-|*peh₂-]]'' ("to protect").

==History==
[[File:Bowl MET SLP1646-1.jpg|thumb|Bowl, Sultanabad ware, first half of the 14th century, fritware, underglaze-painted, Iran. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/461074 |title=Bowl, Iranian, first half 14th century |website=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] website }}</ref>]]
Originally named ''Soltan Abad'', the modern-day city of Arak was founded in 1808 by [[Yusef Khan-e Gorji]],<ref name="de Planhol 1986 247–248">{{cite encyclopedia | article = ARĀK | last = de Planhol | first = X. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arak#pt1 | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. II, Fasc. 3 | pages = 247–248 | year = 1986 }}</ref> a pro-Iranian warlord of [[Georgians|Georgian]] Muslim origin who was given refuge by [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] ruler [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan]] following a territorial dispute with his cousins, who were supported by [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empress [[Catherine the Great]].

Between 1795 and 1797, [[Yusef Khan-e Gorji]], renamed ''Yusef Khan-e Sepahdar'' by the Qajar ruler, settled his army in the fertile but poorly-controlled territory that would become the modern-day Arak. Hostile tribes in the region had operated autonomously from the Qajar rule. With the Shah's approval, Yusef Khan diverted the main river to drive out the hostiles and build the war fortress of Soltan Abad to act as a buffer.

According to early modern historians, Yusef Khan built the city with the aid of effluents. Until 1892, the town remained a military base and fortress. The fortress of Soltan Abad had a thick wall surrounded by 7-meter-deep moats. Eight towers were constructed around the town and the governmental building was established in its northern part.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

In 1891, shops, gardens, and government buildings of Soltan Abad were repaired by the order of deputy governor Mirza Hasan (''Etemad os-Saltane''). Large parts of the city were formerly annexed as personal property to the pre-existing army commanders, and were then ultimately turned over to the state around 1918–1922.

Beginning by the last quarter of the 19th century, the city achieved major developments in carpet industry, and eventually became Iran's most important center of carpet production for export markets, continuing up until at least 1940.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arak: Modern Town and Industry|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arak |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}</ref>

[[File:National Garden Square - Arak - 1963.jpg|thumb|left|National Garden Square in 1969.]]
Under the reign of [[Reza Shah]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], the city was renamed ''Arak''. Modern factories for vegetable oil, soap, sugar beet, and wool industries were established within the city. Arak also became an important station for the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]], a major railway project directed by Reza Shah which was completed in 1938.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

In 1972, two major state-owned enterprises were established in the city, including an aluminum smelter and a heavy engineering plant. The aluminum smelter was built under the ''[[Regional Cooperation for Development]]'' project of the [[Central Treaty Organization]], in cooperation with the company of [[Reynolds and Reynolds]]. The engineering plant was processed with equipment and technical advice from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s, in return of gas sales to the Soviet Union.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

The city officially became a [[metropolis]] on April 6, 2013, after the [[Merger (politics)|merger]] with [[Karahrud]] and [[Senjan]].<ref name="Karahrud and Senjan">{{cite web |title = Approval letter regarding country divisions in Markazi province |language = fa |website = Islamic Parliament Research Center |url = https://rc.majlis.ir/fa/law/show/840807 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208123247/https://rc.majlis.ir/fa/law/show/840807 |publisher = Ministry of Interior, Council of Ministers |last = Rahimi |first = Mohammad Reza |archive-date = 8 December 2015 |date = 25 November 2013 |access-date = 29 August 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rajanews.com/detail.asp?id=154355 |title=تبدیل یک شهر دیگر به کلان شهر-سه شنبه، 25 تير -رجانیوز1392 15:57 |access-date=16 July 2013 |archive-date=22 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222225947/http://rajanews.com/detail.asp?id=154355 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
