=== Telephone ===
In 1915, the [[Bell System]] under ownership of [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T) tested newly developed [[panel switch]]ing technology in Newark when they cutover the [[telephone exchange]]s ''Mulberry'' and ''Waverly'' to semi-mechanical operation on January 16 and June 12, respectively. The Panel system was the Bell System solution to the ''big city'' problem, where an exchange had to serve large numbers of subscribers on both manual as well as automatically switched central offices, without negatively impacting established user convenience and reliability. As originally introduced in these exchanges, subscribers' telephones had no dials and customers continued to make calls by asking an operator to ring their called party, at which point the operator keyed the telephone number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections manually.<ref>Colburn, Robert.

Addonizio was mayor of Newark from 1962 to 1970. A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and World War&nbsp;II veteran, he ran on a reform platform, defeating the incumbent, Leo Carlin, whom, ironically, Addonizio characterized as corrupt and a part of the [[political machine]] of the era.

His successor was Kenneth Gibson, the city's first African American mayor, elected in 1970. He pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion in 2002 as part of a plea agreement on fraud and bribery charges.

Sharpe James, who defeated Gibson in 1986 and declined to run for a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[mail fraud]], and [[wire fraud]] by a federal [[grand jury]] sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty for his role in the conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.<ref>Martin, John.

===Water contamination===
{{Main|Newark water crisis}}
In Newark, lead concentrations in water accumulated for several years in the 2010s as a result of inaccurate testing and poor leadership. Newark's problem came from a negligence of officials who the city relied on to ensure clean water.<ref name="flintmich">{{cite news |last1=Leyden |first1=Liz |title=In Echo of Flint, Mich., Water Crisis Now Hits Newark |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/nyregion/newark-lead-water-pipes.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer |work=The New York Times |date=October 30, 2018 |access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> The decrease in the quality of the water was due to several factors that were all somewhat interconnected. [[Lead service line|Lead service pipes]] that carry water were installed in Newark.<ref name="pri">{{cite web |last1=Wernick |first1=Adam |title=Newark, NJ, has a lead contamination problem in its water |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-04-09/newark-nj-has-lead-contamination-problem-its-water |website=PRI |access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>

When this was recognized, the city had [[CDM Smith]], a construction company that specializes in water systems, conduct a study to determine whether or not the water quality was safe enough to drink. The results revealed that the water was in fact safe to drink, but the results were severely skewed.<ref name="tapinto">{{cite web |last1=Panico |first1=Rebecca |title=Study Shows How Newark's Lead Problem Got So Bad |url=https://www.tapinto.net/towns/newark/sections/government/articles/study-shows-how-newark-s-lead-problem-got-so-bad |website=Tapinto |access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> This is because the city receives water from two water supplies: the Pequannock Treatment Plant and the Wanaque Treatment Plant.<ref name="tapinto" /> In some sampling rounds, only areas served by Pequannock were sampled, and in other rounds, only areas served by Wanaque were sampled, and each had different contaminant control systems in place that varied in their effectiveness. The Pequannock supply uses pH adjustments and [[Sodium silicate|silica]] for its corrosion control method, which worked for two decades before losing its effectiveness in 2016, while the Wanaque supply uses [[orthophosphate]], a much more effective precaution.<ref name="warnings">Corosanti, Nick; Kilgannon, Corey; and Schwartz, John.

Accessed March 1, 2020.</ref><ref name="tapinto" />

In addition to this, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] requires that samples of drinking water be taken after no one has turned on a faucet for at least eight hours. Therefore, if high levels of lead do not show up in that initial sample, no further samples are required.<ref name="tapinto" /> This sample only represents the water closest to the faucet, that has not been stagnant in lead service lines, whereas the stagnant water in the lead piping may not be drawn until much later.<ref name="tapinto" /><ref name="pri" />

Top officials in Newark denied that their water system had a widespread lead problem, declaring on their website that the water was absolutely safe to drink.<ref name="flintmich" /> Even after municipal water tests revealed the severity of the problem Mayor Ras Baraka mailed a brochure to the cities residents that the water meets all federal standards.<ref name="warnings" /> Although the city called an emergency declaration to allow them to purchase and distribute water filters for faucets but many of these were faulty.<ref name="warnings" /> The city has received three noncompliance notices for exceeding lead levels since 2017 and continues to fight its lead problem.<ref name="tapinto" />

In October 2024, it was announced that the company contracted to replace a portion of the lead service lines in Newark, JAS Group Enterprise, Inc. lied and falsified reports while not conducting the work they were hired to do at 1,500 Newark properties. From 2020 to 2022, the company falsified reports by submitting photographs to inspectors of copper pipes and claimed that they were the new replacement pipes they had installed. The company "deliberately instructed workers to leave lead pipes in the ground" and where copper pipes already existed, workers were allegedly instructed to polish and clean them to make them look like newly installed replacement lines. Mayor Baraka claimed the health of Newark residents isn't in danger due to the [[orthophosphate]] that was added to the water to prevent lead leaching and that it is working as intended. City officials stated that they excavated 400 sites where the company claimed to have performed work and 28 of those sites still had lead pipes. The EPA stated that any lead pipes that were discovered have been replaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/newark-lead-pipe-fraud-jas-group-enterprise/5853913/|title=Contractors lied about replacing lead water pipes in Newark, federal prosecutors say|website=NBCNewYork.com|date=October 3, 2024|accessdate=October 3, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/essex/2024/10/company-hired-to-replace-dangerous-lead-pipes-in-newark-faked-102m-in-work-feds-say.html|title=Company hired to replace dangerous lead pipes in Newark faked $10.2M in work, feds say|publisher=NJ Advance Media|date=October 3, 2024|accessdate=October 3, 2024}}</ref>

==== Early modes of transport ====
[[File:NewarkTrolleyCourthouse.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Newark Trolley line on Market Street near Newark's present day courthouse]]
The [[Morris Canal]], stretching {{convert|102|miles}} to Newark from [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey|Phillipsburg]] on the [[Delaware River]], was completed in 1831 and allowed coal and other industrial and agricultural products from [[Pennsylvania]] to be transported cheaply and efficiently to the [[New York metropolitan area]]. The canal's completion led to increased settlement in Newark, vastly increasing the population for years to come. After the canal was decommissioned, its right of way was converted into the [[Newark City Subway]], now known as the [[Newark Light Rail]]. Many of the subway stations still portray the canal in its original state, in the form of [[mosaic]] works.<ref>Solarino, Audrey.

Accessed June 28, 2012.</ref>

As the city became increasingly congested further means of transportation were sought, eventually leading to [[horse-drawn trolley]]s. These, in turn, were replaced by [[electric trolley]]s that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse.<ref>{{YouTube| KQUJrK8aVeA | "Broad & Market Street, Newark – 1928 Transportation & Streetscapes" }}</ref> The trolley cars did not last long as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.<ref>Drummond, James O.

In 2016, annual testing of the water in Newark's public schools revealed elevated lead levels; more than 30 schools shut off their water fountains and turned to bottled water. In August 2019 the crisis over lead contamination in drinking water resurfaced because of new warnings from federal environmental officials. It is believed that the contamination was caused by aging lead pipes and changes in the water supply that makes the water more corrosive, causing lead from the pipes to be spread to the water inside.<ref>Corasaniti, Nick; Kilgannon, Corey; and Schwartz, John.
