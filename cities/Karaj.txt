== History ==
[[File:کاروانسرای شاه عباسی کرج 1.jpg|thumb|left|Shah-Abbasi [[Caravansary]]]]

The area around Karaj has been inhabited for thousands of years, as shown by the [[Bronze Age]] site of Tepe Khurvin and the [[Iron Age]] site of Kalak.<ref>L. van den Berghe, ''La nécropole de Khūrvīn'', Istanbul, Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Instituut in het Nabije Oosten, 1964.</ref><ref name="Iranica">{{cite web |last1=Hourcade |first1=Bernard |title=KARAJ i. Modern City |url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/karaj-city-modern-city |website=Encyclopaedia Iranica |access-date=15 October 2022}}</ref> However, the present-day city of Karaj is mostly the result of modern industrial development in the 20th century.<ref name="Iranica"/>

Karaj was mostly significant as a stage on the road between Tehran and [[Qazvin]].<ref name="Iranica"/> In [[Safavid]] times, a stone bridge was built that served as the main crossing into the town.<ref name="Iranica"/> The large [[Shah Abbasi Caravansarai, Karaj|Shah-Abbasi Caravansarai]], located at the southeast of Towhid Square, was built in the same era, under the rule of [[Shah Ismail|Šāh Esmāil]].

In 1810, the Qajar prince Soleyman Mirza built the [[Soleymaniyeh Palace]] at Karaj to serve as a summer resort.<ref name="Iranica"/> The palace had four towers and was surrounded by gardens, and its reception room featured a pair of paintings by [[Abdallah Khan|Abdallah Khan Naqqashbandi]].<ref name="Iranica"/> By 1860, however, the palace was described as abandoned and only used as a shelter for travelers.<ref name="Iranica"/> [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] later renovated the palace.<ref name="Iranica"/> In 1917, a School of Farming was established on the site, replacing the earlier Mozaffari Agricultural School in Tehran.<ref name="Iranica"/> Later, [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]] granted it to the [[University of Tehran]]'s new Faculty of Agriculture.<ref name="Iranica"/>

In the 1930s, plans were drawn up for a large industrial complex covering 216 [[hectare]]s on the south side of the village.<ref name="Iranica"/> This "Industrial Model Town of Karaj" was intended to be the site of the country's first [[steel mill]]s, capitalizing on easy access to water and coal from the Alborz.<ref name="Iranica"/> However, the construction equipment imported from Germany was impounded by the British going through the [[Suez Canal]] in 1940, and the planned complex was never built.<ref name="Iranica"/>

A major industrial complex, the first privately-owned one in Karaj, was built in the 1960s by Mohammad-Sadeq Fateh.<ref name="Iranica"/> This complex, called Shahrak-e Jahanshahr, included oil, tea, and textile factories as well as housing for the workers.<ref name="Iranica"/>

[[File:Pearl Palace -Kakh e Morvarid- Karaj Iran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Morvarid Palace]]]]
The [[Morvarid Palace|Morvārid Palace]] was constructed in nearby [[Mehrshahr|Mehršahr]] district, during the [[Pahlavi era]]. It was designed by the ''[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] Foundation'' ([[Taliesin Associated Architects]]) on instructions from [[Shams Pahlavi]], elder sister of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. In this period it was a transit and industrial town.

Majority of the structure is now controlled by the [[Basij|Basij Organization]], and some sections of it are open to public under the operation of [[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran]].

Other historical sites of the city include the Mausoleum of Šāhzāde Soleymān, [[Imamzadeh|Emāmzāde]] Rahmān, Emāmzāde Zeyd, and [[Palangabad District|Palang Ābād]] e [[Eshtehard County|Eštehārd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itto.org/iran/city/Karaj_City/|title=Karaj city in Alborz province, travel to iran, Visit Iran|first=Sirang Rasaneh|last=www.sirang.com|website=itto.org &#124; Iran Tourism & Touring}}</ref>

[[Amir Kabir Dam]] and some other small lakes are based in Karaj.

== Economy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
The economic base of Karaj is its proximity to [[Tehran]]. It is due to the transportation of products between Tehran and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Chemicals, fertilizers and processed agricultural goods are also produced in the city.

Zowb Āhan, the avenue leading to an industrial plant, is located at the south of Ostandar Square. ''Zowb e Āhan'' or ''Zowb Āhan'', literally "steel mill", was a contract between the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] government and a consortium from [[Nazi Germany]]. The establishment of the factory ''Zowb Āhan e Karaj'' was halted by the beginning of the [[Second World War]], and it was never launched.

Šahrak-e Jahānšahr was the first modern private industrial and housing complex of Karaj, built in the 1960s. The factories ''Jahān Čit'' (textile factory), ''Rowqan Nabāti e Jahān'' (oil factory), and ''Čāy e Jahān'' (tea factory), were established at the complex. It is one of the largest industrial zones of the nation, with a 20% share of the national GDP.

The [[special economic zone]] of Payam, with an area about {{cvt|3600|ha|km2 acre}} within the territory of [[Payam International Airport]], was established in Karaj for development of air cargo and postal transportation, cold store, and packing services, as well as perishable and time sensitive exports.
