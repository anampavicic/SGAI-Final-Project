'''Hermosillo''' ({{IPA|es-419|eɾmoˈsiʝo|lang|Hermosillo.ogg}}), formerly called '''Pitic''' (as in ''Santísima Trinidad del Pitic'' and ''Presidio del Pitic''), is a city in the center of the northwestern Mexican state of [[Sonora]]. It is the municipal seat of the [[Hermosillo Municipality|Hermosillo municipality]], the state's capital and largest city, as well as the primary economic center for the state and the region.<ref name="encmuc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb/ELOCAL/EMM_sonora |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Sonora Hermosillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |access-date=January 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616191618/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb/ELOCAL/EMM_sonora |archive-date=June 16, 2011 }}</ref> As of 2020, the city has a population of 936,263, making it the 18th largest city in Mexico.<ref>INEGI.

Hermosillo was ranked as one of the five best cities to live in, in Mexico, as published in the study "The Most Livable Cities of Mexico 2013" by the Strategic Communications Cabinet of the Mexican Federal Government. Hermosillo was also ranked in 2016 as the seventh most competitive city in the country according to the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), based on factors such as its economic diversification, geographical location, access to education, government, innovation and international relations. The major manufacturing sector has been the production of automobiles since the 1980s. It is one of the richest cities in Mexico by [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]].

Hermosillo has a subtropical [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''). Temperatures have been as high as {{convert|49.5|C|F|1}} in the summer months, making it one of the hottest cities in the country.

==History==
[[File:Anastacio Cuca 1887.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Anastasio Cuca]], [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] leader, 1887]]
Evidence from a site called the [[San Dieguito Complex]], located in the El Pinacate Zone, suggests the area has been inhabited by humans for about 3,000 years. Evidence of agriculture dates back 2,500 years.<ref name="jfelix">{{cite web|url=http://www.sonoraturismo.gob.mx/hermosillo-sonora.htm |title=Hermsillo, Sonora Destinos de Sonora |first=José Rómulo |last=Félix Gastélum |publisher=Government of Sonora |location=Hermosillo, Sonora |language=es |trans-title=Hermosillo, Sonora Destinations of Sonora |access-date=January 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228191722/http://www.sonoraturismo.gob.mx/hermosillo-sonora.htm |archive-date=February 28, 2009 }}</ref> In the [[pre-Hispanic]] era, this area was inhabited by the historic [[Seri people|Seri]], Tepoca, and [[Pima people|Pima]] peoples.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="jfelix"/>

The first encounter between the Spanish and the indigenous peoples of the area occurred in the middle of the 16th century, when European explorers came in search of gold. The Spanish explorers were followed by Jesuit missionaries in the state of Sonora around 1614. [[Eusebio Kino|Eusebio Francisco Kino]] arrived in 1687, founding a mission in nearby [[Cucurpe]]. The present-day states of [[Sonora]] and [[Sinaloa]] were loosely organized as the provinces of [[Sonora]], Ostimuri, and [[Sinaloa]].<ref name="jfelix"/>

In 1700, three small Spanish villages were founded in what is now the outskirts of Hermosillo: '''Nuestra Señora del Pópulo''', '''Nuestra Señora de Los Angeles''', and '''la Santísima Trinidad del Pitic'''. The native peoples here soon became hostile to the colonists and repeatedly drove them out in the early 18th century. In 1716, the Spanish offered irrigated lands for farmers to the native peoples, who agreed to abide by Spanish law. Around 1726, a fort named the Presidio of Pitic was constructed to stop the domination of this area by the natives, especially the [[Seri people|Seri]]. However, the situation remained contentious. The first church was not built until 1787, and the first formal parish was not established until 1822.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="jfelix"/>

During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Sonora and the town of Pitic stayed loyal to the [[Spanish Crown]]. Local general Alejo García Conde defeated insurgent José María González Hermosillo, who had been sent by [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]].<ref name="jfelix"/> Following independence from Spain, in 1825 the village of Pitic was made the seat of the department of the same name. In 1828, the settlement changed its name to Hermosillo to honor the insurgent leader José María González de Hermosillo.<ref name="encmuc"/>

A battle between imperial and republican forces occurred in 1866 during the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]]. In 1879, the capital of the state of Sonora was moved from [[Arizpe]] to Hermosillo. In 1881 the railroad linking Hermosillo with [[Guaymas]] and [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]] was finished, allowing for economic expansion in the area by bringing in mining equipment and modern agricultural equipment. Since then, the city has been an economic center for northwest Mexico.<ref name="encmuc"/>

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], beginning in 1910, forces loyal to [[Pancho Villa]] were expelled from the city by General Manuel M. Diéguez.<ref name="encmuc"/> After the assassination of [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1913, [[Venustiano Carranza]], then governor of [[Coahuila]], sought refuge in Hermosillo. Here, Carranza began the Constitutionalist Movement. As a result, Hermosillo is nicknamed the "revolutionary capital of the country."<ref name="jfelix"/>

From the late 19th century, until around 1920, Chinese immigrants entered the state of Sonora as laborers. A significant number settled in the city of Hermosillo. Some of these immigrants established businesses, especially shoe manufacturing and clothing. Some of the most successful Chinese-owned businesses in Sonora were based in Hermosillo, and sold their merchandise to other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite book |title= Displacements and Diasporas : Asians in the Americas. |editor1-first=Robert G. |editor1-last=Lee |others= Wanni Wibulswasdi Anderson (Editor) |year=2005 |publisher= Rutgers University Press |location= New Brunswick, NJ, USA |pages=91–92 |url= http://site.ebrary.com/lib/itesm/Doc?id=10114307&ppg=101 |access-date=January 13, 2010}}</ref> But by the 1920s, anti-Chinese sentiment had become strong in Sonora state, and many Chinese left for Mexico City or the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campos Rico |first1=Ivonne Virginia |title= La Formación de la Comunidad China en México: políticas, migración, antichinismo y relaciones socioculturales (thesis) |year=2003 |publisher=Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH-SEP) |location=Mexico City |language=es |page=91 }}</ref>

Hermosillo was the site of a tragic fire, at the ABC Child Care Center, on June 5, 2009.

=== Origins ===
The origin of Hermosillo dates to the 1700s, when the mission villages of Our Lady of The Populace, Our Lady of Angels, and the Holy Trinity of Pitic were founded. They collected members of the [[Yaqui]], [[Seri people|Seri]], Tepoca, and [[Pima Bajo people|Pima Bajo]] peoples.

Years earlier, internal difficulties had occurred between the Tepoca and the Bajo Pima peoples. The Spanish wanted to bring them into the mission villages to have more control over their work.

The villages and city were intended to contain the Seri and Tepoca Indians, to protect the Hispanic expansion. It was called the '''Real Presidio de San Pedro de la Conquista''', named after Viceroy Don Pedro de Castro y Figueroa, Duke of the Conquest and Marquis of Grace. The explorer in charge of the foundation of the peoples was {{ill|Juan Bautista de Escalante|es}}, who pacified tensions.

On May 18, 1700, he gave a speech that was documented, in part: 
<blockquote>"Sending them to have no wars from now on, but to live as Christians and to deal with each other with fairs of the clothes of their use and seeds of their plantings, to which they responded from one and the other, which they would do thank ingsands thank ing best for the good that they made peace of way."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos27/fundacion-hermosillo/fundacion-hermosillo.shtml |title= How Hermosillo was founded |publisher=monografias.com |access-date= 29 November 2013| last=Lagarda |first=Ignacio|date= 26 October 2005 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 1718, on the orders of Governor Manuel de San Juan y Santa Cruz, the town of the Holy Trinity of Pitic was repopulated; on September 29, 1725, the Seri settled in the Pópulo rose in the son of war and invaded the people of Opodepe. The Seri were persecuted for the purpose of punishing them until they signed the peace in January 1726, and they were settled in the Porplo and in the points called Alares and Moraga; subsequently given the uncertainty due to the bellicoseness of the indigenous, the Pitic presidio was formed.

====Presidio de San Pedro de la Conquista del Pitic====
In June 1741, Don Agustin de Vildósola established the Presidio de San Pedro de la Conquista del Pitic.
Nine years later, the troops of the Pupium were transferred to El Pópulo, in the present municipality of [[San Miguel de Horcasitas]]. As a result of this action, Pitic was left in a very precarious situation, because numerous residents emigrated for fear of the Seri.

While the Presidio's settlement was about to disappear, senior authorities ordered a group of soldiers to remain on site to ensure the safety of the settlers. In 1772, the mayor Pedro de Corbalán ordered the construction of a canal on the left bank of the [[Sonora River|Rio Sonora]], to irrigate the lands and orchards.

Pitic's Villa .A.
Before the end of the eighteenth century the former Presidio of San Pedro de la Conquista del Pitic became Villa del Pitic.

On February 9, 1825, the Villa del Pitic was established as the head of the party, dependent on the Department of Horcasitas. This coincided with the urbanization that the royal surveyors gave it, as it progressed steadily.

In 1827, the city had approximately eight thousand inhabitants, and its urbanization was very particular, as the houses were scattered in all directions. The region was fertile, well-cultivated and provided an abundance of what was necessary for life and even many luxuries. Already then it was very cheap, high-quality beef that to this day is famous.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Henry George|title= 'Mexico' in 1827|edition=First |language= es|year=1981|publisher=American Library, Economic Culture Fund|isbn=968-16-0645-0 |chapter=Appendix C |page =758}}</ref>

====The Village of Hermosillo====
On September 5, 1828, by decree no. 77 of the H. Legislature of the State of the West, the name ''Villa del Pitic'' was deleted and the name of the ''City of Hermosillo'' was imposed, in honor of the general [[Jalisco|jalisciense]] José María González de Hermosillo who in the late 1810s had carried the task of the national insurrection to lands [[Sinaloa|Sinaloenses]], then part of the Western State as well.

On March 12, 1831, the State of [[Sonora]] was founded and Hermosillo was its first capital from 14 May of that year to May 25, 1832, when the capital powers were transferred to the city of [[Arizpe]]. In 1837, the city was erected at the head of the district of its name. On the same date, Don Pascual Iñigo began the construction of the Chapel of Our Lady of Carmen.

On October 14, 1852, in the city, a section of filibusters under the command of [[Gaston de Raousset-Boulbon|Gastón de Raousset-Boulbon]] faced and defeated the national forces, who were under the leadership of General Miguel Blanco de Estrada; this was part of a revolutionary campaign of independence that was intended however to turn [[Sonora]] and [[Lower California]] into colonial territories of France. However, Raousset remained only a few days in the city, choosing to go to [[Guaymas]] to continue his campaign where he would eventually be defeated by General José María Yáñez Carrillo in Battle of Guaymas in 1854.

On May 4, 1866, under [[Second Mexican Empire|the Second Mexican Empire]] of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]],  republican troops commanded by the general {{ill|Ángel Martínez (soldier)|lt=Ángel Martínez|es|Ángel Martínez (militar)}} attacked and seized the city, which was being defended by [[Second Mexican Empire|the Second Mexican Empire]] under Colonel María Tranquilino Almada. However, a few hours later, it fell back into the hands of the forces of the Second Empire. On November 13, 1866, General Martinez again took the city in blood and fire, causing the imperialists to flee; but they returned and  regained it eight days later.

In 1879 Hermosillo was once again the headquarters of state powers, thanks to the management of the acting governor Don Francisco Serna, at least on an interim date. However, when the new Political Constitution of the State of Sonora was issued on September 15, 1917, it was definitively confirmed that the city of Hermosillo is the headquarters of the state powers, as referred to in article 28 thereof.<ref>'[http://www.hermosillo.gob.mx/?sel-3 Sherillo's Town Hall – Visitors]</ref>

On November 4 in front of the wooden station of [[Sonora]], dozens of people gathered at the opening of the Guaymas-Hermosillo railway section. On the train came Don Carlos Rodrigo Ortiz Retes, accompanied by the commander of the Military Zone, brigadier Colonel José Guillermo Carbó. Months later, both cargo and passenger service would be established between [[Guaymas]] and the [[Nogales (Sonora)|Noals]].

===20th century===
[[File:Hermosillo 1910-1915.tif|thumb|Overview of the city of Hermosillo with Chapel of our Lady of Carmen on the right, in front of Madero Park, c. 1910]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, Hermosillo had about 14,000 inhabitants. During the [[Mexican Revolution]], forces loyal to [[Pancho Villa|Francisco 'Pancho' Villa]] were expelled from the city by General Manuel M. Diéguez. After the assassination of [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1913, [[Venustiano Carranza]], then governor of Coahuila sought refuge in Hermosillo. Here Carranza began the [[Constitutionalists in the Mexican Revolution|Constitutionalist Movement]]; because of this, Hermosillo has the nickname "''the revolutionary capital of the country'".

In the late 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century, Chinese immigrants arrived in Sonora. One of the settlements with a significant number was the city of Hermosillo. Some of these immigrants had money and used it to set up businesses, especially shoe and clothing manufacturing. Some of the most successful businesses with Chinese owners in Sonora were in Hermosillo and sold merchandise to other parts of the country. However, in the 1920s, sentiment against the Chinese population in Sonora grew, resulting in many fleeing to Mexico City or the United States.

In the 1980s, Ford built [[Hermosillo Stamping & Assembly]] in the city, which had a major impact on the city's economy and that of the state. A whole chain of suppliers was also developed around the assembly plant, which further contributed to economic growth in Hermosillo. Hermosillo was selected partly due to its proximity to the United States.<ref>http://www.colef.mx/jorgecarrillo/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PU354.pdf-title-archived{{Dead link|date=August 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} copy-date-access-June 3, 2015-urlfile-https://web.archive.org.org/web/20160307003021/http://www.colef.mx/jorgecarrillo/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PU354.pdf-file-date-March 7-</ref><ref>http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.gerpisa.univ-evry.fr/ContentPages/44177382.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

In 2000, the businessman [[Pancho Búrquez]] was elected as municipal president for National Action Party, in that triennium, the municipality won national awards (such as that of the Secretariat of Comptroller ship and Administrative Development of the federal government, as well as of the [[International City/County Management Association]] as one of the most transparent cities in the world. Investment grew in the early decade thanks to the ease of doing business.

One of the most important events in Hermosillo was the ABC Nursery Fire on June 5, 2009. According to the Attorney General's Office of the State of Sonora, there were 49 deaths in the fire. The fire apparently began in a warehouse, then expanded to the daycare. Most of the children died of asphyxiation. There were about 100 children inside the building; firefighters and the population had to make holes in the walls to rescue the children, ranging from six months to five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arenapolitica.com.mx/index.php?option%27com_content&view%27article&id%276407:pgr-pide-a-firma-britanica-peritaje-on-abc&9:from-the-border-world|title=ArenaPolitica.com.mx|website=arenapolitica.com.mx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2015/06/02/pgr-present-a-padres-of-guarderia-abc-plan-de-investigacion-2419.2419.html|title=archived copy|date=June 10, 2015}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.com.au/news/14566/0/parents/victims-guardians-abc-sonosuary/keep-demand-justice/ |title=Parents of victims of the ABC nursery keep their demand for justice – 20minutos.com.mx }}</ref>

As the municipal seat, the city of Hermosillo is the local government of over 3,800 other localities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=es |access-date=January 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328224939/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archive-date=March 28, 2007 }}</ref> with a combined territory of {{convert|14880.2|km2|1|abbr=out}}.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The two most important rivers are the [[Sonora River|Sonora]] and the [[San Miguel River (Mexico)|San Miguel]]. Both of these are used for irrigation purposes with the Abelardo L. Rodriguez Dam located on the San Miguel River.<ref name="encmuc"/> The population increase of the [[Hermosillo (municipality)|municipality]], currently at 2.5% annually, puts pressure on the infrastructure of the city, especially its water supply.<ref name="stanpoor">{{cite web |url= http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/es/la/page.article/2,1,7,0,1063041582163.html |title= Fundamento: Hermosillo, Sonora (Municipio de) |date=June 2009 |publisher=Standard & Poor's |language=es |trans-title=Foundation:Hermosillo, Sonora (Municipality of) |access-date=January 13, 2010 }}</ref> Decades of overpumping of ground water have led to the aquifer levels being lower than sea levels, and sea water creeping in as an "artificial recharge."<ref>{{cite book |title= Importance of hydrogeological modeling in the management of groundwater, a case study: the coast of Hermosillo Aquifer, Sonora, Mexico |last= Rangel Medina |first= Miguel |publisher= SINEX (conference paper) |location= Spain |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug-YEjQspCoC&q=hermosillo+sonora&pg=PA277 |access-date= January 13, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160518152432/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug-YEjQspCoC&pg=PA277&lpg=PA277&dq=hermosillo+sonora&source=bl&ots=4tOdXU40kk&sig=hqUyWxYXjD_XCJ2IZW33n9T0zxQ&hl=es&ei=P8NLS8H8GpGQtgfn4KHkDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBIQ6AEwBTikAw#v=onepage&q=hermosillo%20sonora&f=false |archive-date= May 18, 2016 |url-status= live |isbn= 9780415364447 |date= June 30, 2005 }}</ref>

===Climate and ecology===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Hermosillo features a borderline [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot arid]] (''BWh'')/[[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid]] (''BSh'') climate. Temperatures can range from as low as freezing in December and January to {{convert|48|C|F|1}} in June and July. Rain falls mostly between July and September, with annual precipitation between {{convert|75|and|400|mm|in|1}}. Hermosillo's all-time weather record for high temperature is {{convert|49.5|C|F}}, which was achieved in June 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=76160: Hermosillo, Son.

Most of the regional flora consists of [[mesquite]] trees, with an added mixture of [[blue agave]], [[desert ironwood]], [[Parkinsonia aculeata|palo verde]] and the [[Vachellia farnesiana var. farnesiana|huisache]]. Native fauna includes the [[desert tortoise]], several species of [[rattlesnake]] and [[kingsnake]], [[mule deer]] (locally called ‘coues’ deer), [[collared peccary]], [[ringtail]], [[ocelot]], [[cougar|puma]], [[desert bighorn sheep]], [[opossum]], [[raccoon]], [[coyote]], and [[bobcat]]. [[American black bear|Black bear]] may be observed on occasion, on the fringes of settled areas.<ref name="encmuc"/> In August 2022, the once-common [[jaguar]] was finally witnessed in the Hermosillo area. Locals nicknamed the lone male “El Jefe”, meaning “boss”.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wildlandsnetwork.org/news/arizona-jaguar-central-sonora |publisher=Wildlands Network |title=Arizona jaguar "El Jefe" reappears in central Sonora }}</ref> The critically endangered [[Sonoran pronghorn]] antelope was once common in the area; less than 200 are thought to exist today, with an additional -200 (declining) surviving in the U.S. state of [[Arizona]]. Populations of feral [[red-masked parakeet]]s and [[monk parakeet]]s are a local sightseeing attraction here.

==Economy==

[[File:Hmotwr.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Torre Hermosillo]], built in 1995 in [[Northeast Hermosillo]]]]

Most of the [[Hermosillo (Municipality)|municipality's]] population lives in the city proper, with most jobs located in the manufacturing and commerce sectors here. About 250,000 hectares are under cultivation in the city's outskirts, most of which is near the coast. Crops include wheat, grapes, flowers, [[chickpea]]s, [[alfalfa]] and [[walnut]]s. Livestock has been traditionally important here, especially beef cattle. Pigs, sheep, goats, horses, domestic fowl and bees are also raised here as well. Fishing is practiced along the coast with shrimp being the most important catch.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Industry and manufacturing has been the most dynamic sector of the economy. Much of this began in the 1980s with the establishment of the automobile industry, specifically the [[Hermosillo Stamping & Assembly]] plant owned and operated by [[Ford Motor Company]]. Electronics and IT are the largest employers by both revenue and number of employees. Today, there are twenty-six major manufacturers, which generate about 68,300 jobs, employing about thirty percent of the population.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Other than cars, products manufactured here include televisions, computers, food processing, textiles, wood products, printing, cellular phones, chemicals, petroleum products and plastics. [[Lanix]] electronics has a major research and design facility and its main manufacturing plant in Hermosillo. The city and its [[Hermosillo (municipality)|municipality]] have twelve industrial parks, which house over one hundred smaller manufacturing enterprises.<ref name="encmuc"/> There has been slowing of this sector especially the automobile industry because of the global economic downturn that began in 2008.<ref name="stanpoor"/>

Commerce employs more than half of the population; besides small local businesses, chains are well represented; these are locally, regionally (Northwest Mexico), nationally, and U.S.-based. Tourism is mostly limited to the coastal communities of Bahia de Kino, Kino Nuevo and [[Punta Chueca]], where there are cave paintings and a recreational park named La Sauceda.<ref name="encmuc"/>
In 2009, [[Standard & Poor's]] rated the [[Hermosillo (municipality)|municipality of Hermosillo]] as (mxA/Estable/-) based on its administrative practices, financial flexibility and limited financial risks. Financial management of the municipality has been prudent, with adequate documentation of practices. Debt levels have also been prudent at about 33% of gross income, which might decline in 2010. However, the municipality has limited liquid capital.<ref name="stanpoor"/>

==Sports==
===Baseball===
The city has a professional baseball team called [[Naranjeros de Hermosillo]] (Orange Growers) that plays in the [[Estadio Sonora]]. Baseball has been popular in Hermosillo since the late 19th century. The club had its beginnings in the 1950s, when the Liga Invernal de Sonora (Sonora Winter League) was founded as a complement to the already existing Liga de la Costa del Pacífico (Pacific Coast League). The Naranjeros were officially organized in 1958. Since then, the team has won 16 championships in the Pacific Coast League and two championships in the [[Caribbean Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naranjeros.com.mx/historia.htm |title=Historia del Club |publisher=Naranjeros Baseball Club |location=Hermosillo |language=es |trans-title=History of the Club |access-date=January 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229190601/http://www.naranjeros.com.mx/historia.htm |archive-date=December 29, 2009 }}</ref> Hermosillo hosted the 2013 [[Caribbean Series]] in February.

The Museo de Sonora (Museum of Sonora) is housed in a building that originally functioned as a prison. It was completed in 1907 and built by the mostly indigenous prisoners themselves.
