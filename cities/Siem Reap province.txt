'''Siem Reap''', officially '''Siemreap'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Geographical Names of the Kingdom of Cambodia |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/8th-uncsgn-docs/inf/8th_UNCSGN_econf.94_INF.30_corr1.pdf |website=UNSTATS |publisher=Eighth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names|date=29 August 2002|access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> ({{langx|km|សៀមរាប}} {{IPA-km|siəm riəp|}}, {{Literal translation|Siam's Defeated}}), is a [[Provinces of Cambodia|province]] (''khaet'') of [[Cambodia]]. It borders the provinces of [[Oddar Meanchey province|Oddar Meanchey]] to the north, [[Preah Vihear province|Preah Vihear]] and [[Kampong Thom province|Kampong Thom]] to the east, [[Battambang province|Battambang]] to the south, and [[Banteay Meanchey]] to the west. Its capital and largest city is [[Siem Reap]].

Siem Reap province is the tenth largest province in Cambodia. Having reached a population of one million in 2019, it ranks as the nation's fourth most populous province.<ref name=census2019/> A large portion of Siem Reap province's southern border is demarcated by the [[Tonle Sap]] and as such, it is one of the nine provinces that making up the [[Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve]]. In modern times the province is best known as the site of [[Angkor]] and the [[Angkor Wat]] temple ruins, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. It is also the home of [[Banteay Srei]], [[Roluos (temples)]], the UNESCO tentative site of [[Beng Mealea]], and the UNESCO tentative site of [[Phnom Kulen National Park]], home to the country's largest reclining Buddha.

==Etymology==
The name ''Siem Reap'' literally means 'Siam defeated' and emerged after the victory of Ang Chan I over the Siamese in 1530 at Angkor, a reminder of the centuries-old conflict between the Siamese and the Khmer. In Siam, the province and its capital were called ''Siemmarat'' ({{langx|th|เสียมราฐ}}), literally meaning 'Siam's territory'.<ref>Article 6 of the "Convention between France and Siam Amending the Stipulations of the Treaty of 8 October 1904, Concerning the Territories and the Other Arrangements, Signed at Paris, the 13th February 1904."</ref>

The capital was again renamed "Siem Reap" (siam defeated) after it was rightfully returned to Cambodia in 1907 under the reign of Sisowath I (1904-1927) after military pressure on Siam by the joint forces of Cambodia and the French colonial government.

==History==
The province came under the control of the Thai kingdom of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] in 1795 and was later returned to Cambodia in 1907 after the [[French Indochina|French colonist authority]] made a treaty with Siam for the exchange of [[Trat province|Trat]] and [[Dan Sai district|Dan Sai]] for the Siamese province of Inner Cambodia which included Phra Tabong (Battambang), Siemmarat (Siem Reap), and Nakhon Wat (Angkor Wat). The Inner Cambodia province was split into Battambang and Siem Reap by the royal decree of [[Sisowath of Cambodia|King Sisowath]] the same year. This area became part of a disputed territory between France and Siam (now Thailand) which led to the [[Franco-Thai War]] in 1941, resulting in victory for Thailand and a return to Thai control (with exception of Siem Reap and Angkor Wat). The province again reverted to Cambodia in 1946, after the end of World War II with French and [[United Nations|UN]] international pressure.
