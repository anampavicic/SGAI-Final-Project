{{Nihongo|'''Niigata'''|新潟市|Niigata-shi|extra={{IPA|ja|niːɡata|}}}} is a city located in the northern part of [[Niigata Prefecture]] ({{ill|Kaetsu area|ja|下越地方}}). It is the capital and the most populous [[Cities of Japan|city]] of [[Niigata Prefecture]], and one of the [[cities designated by government ordinance of Japan]], located in the [[Chūbu region]] of [[Japan]]. It is the most populous city on the west coast of [[Honshu]], and the second populous city in Chūbu region after [[Nagoya]]. It faces the [[Sea of Japan]] and [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]]. {{As of|2022|09|01}}, the city had an estimated population of 779,049, and a [[population density]] of 1,072 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. The total area is {{convert|726.45|sqkm|sqmi}}. Greater Niigata, the Niigata [[Urban Employment Area|Metropolitan Employment Area]], has a GDP of US$43.3 billion as of 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/UEA/uea_data_e.htm|title = Metropolitan Employment Area (MEA) Data|author = Yoshitsugu Kanemoto|publisher = Center for Spatial Information Science, The [[University of Tokyo]]|access-date = 2016-09-29|archive-date = 2018-06-15|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111107/http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/UEA/uea_data_e.htm|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>[https://data.oecd.org/conversion/exchange-rates.htm Conversion rates - Exchange rates] - OECD Data</ref>

It is the only government-designated city on the west coast of Honshu. It has the greatest habitable area of cities in Japan ({{ill|list of Japanse cities by area|ja|日本の市の面積一覧}}). It is designated as a reform base for the large scale agriculture under  ({{ill|National Strategic Special Zones of Japan|ja|国家戦略特別区域}}) initiatives.

==Overview==
Niigata was one of the cities incorporated by the legislation effective on April 1, 1889 (Meiji 22). With a long history as a port town, Niigata served the function of the network junction between the maritime traffic and those of Shinano and Agano river systems. It was designated as one of the five free [[treaty ports]] under the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] between the United States and Japan, signed in 1858, just before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and later started operations in 1869. Its importance in land and water transportation is still current. 

Niigata's city government was established in 1889. Mergers with nearby municipalities in 2005 allowed the city's population to jump to 810,000. The annexation of the surrounding area has also given the city the greatest rice [[paddy field]] acreage in Japan. On April 1, 2007, it became the first [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|government-designated city]] on the coast of the Sea of Japan of Honshu. There are eight [[Wards of Japan|wards]] ([[#Wards|described later]]) in the city.

Until the 1950s, a system of canals were lined along by the willow trees in the downtown area of Niigata.  Therefore the city is sometimes called the "City of Water" or "City of Willows" as [[#Geography|detailed later]]. Niigata produced many manga artists (see: [[#Artists and writers|Artists and writers]]). It is also known to have an extensive network of [[#Roads|bypass roads]]. Bandai bridge, NEXT21, Toki Messe, Denka Big Swan Stadium, Niigata Nippo Media Ship are considered to be the key symbol landmarks in the city (see: [[#Local attractions|Local attractions]]).

===Toponymy===
The place name "Niigata" was first recorded in 1520 ([[Eishō (Muromachi period)|Eisho 17]]).<ref>{{Cite book|author = 知っておきたい新潟県の歴史編集委員会|year = 2010 |script-title=ja:知っておきたい新潟県の歴史|publisher = 新潟日報事業社|isbn = 978-4861323720}}</ref> Its name in [[kanji]] can be translated as {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|新}}}} "new" and {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|潟}}}} "lagoon".

However, as there is no record about the origin of the name, this had led to many theories. 
*First "Niigata" was a large lagoon at the mouth of the Shinano river. 
*Second it was an inland bay at the river's entrance. 
*Third it was the name of a village that stood on an island within the estuary. 
*Fourth it referred to another settlement that relocated to the [[Furumachi (Niigata)|Furumachi district]] and that in turn gave its name to a nearby lagoon.<ref>{{Cite book|author = 角川日本地名大辞典 編纂委員会|year = 1989 |script-title=ja:角川日本地名大辞典 15 新潟県|publisher = (株)角川書店|isbn = 4-04-001150-3}}</ref>

==Geography==
Niigata is situated on a fertile [[coastal plain]] on the [[Sea of Japan]] coast, facing [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]]. The [[Shinano River]] and [[Agano River]] flow through the city.

Numerous wetlands, such as the Fukushimagata wetlands, can be found within the city limits. The Sakata lagoon is registered as a wetland of international importance under the [[Ramsar Convention]].

Niigata City's low elevation and abundant water have made flood control and land reclamation important issues for the area throughout its history.

The city is sometimes called the {{Nihongo|"City of Water"|水の都|Mizu-no-miyako}} because of the two rivers that flow through it, its position next to the Sea of Japan, its many wetlands, and the canals that used to run through the city. It is also sometimes referred to as the {{nihongo|"City of Willows"|柳の都|Yanagi-no-miyako}} or {{Nihongo||柳都|Ryuto}} because of the willow trees that lined the old canals. In recent years, the city has been promoting itself as a {{Nihongo|"Designated City of Food and Flowers"|食と花の政令市|Shoku to hana no seireishi}}, highlighting its agricultural areas outside of the city center.

===Climate===
Niigata City features a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfa]]). However, due to high precipitation, it receives more yearly snowfall than cities with continental climates such as Moscow, Montreal or Oslo. Winters are characterized by their high humidity and strong winds from the Sea of Japan. While many other parts of Niigata Prefecture tend to have heavy snow, Niigata City itself usually receives less due to its low-lying elevation and the shielding effect of [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]].

On average, Niigata City has 269 days of precipitation each year, about 170 days of which see rain or snowfall measuring over 1&nbsp;mm.<ref>[http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_sfc_ym.php?prec_no=54&prec_ch=%90V%8A%83%8C%A7&block_no=47604&block_ch=%90V%8A%83&year=&month=&day=&view=a1 平年値(年・月ごとの値)]</ref> The [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] in July brings large amounts of rain, while the winter months, especially November and December, also have much precipitation.<ref name="NIIGATAdata">''Niigata City 2007 Statistical Data'', published 2007</ref>

In summer, the south wind makes the weather rather hot.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} [[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] usually bring strong [[foehn wind]]s to this area, generally causing somewhat higher temperatures than in other parts of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} The weather on the west coast of Honshu tends to be better during the summer months than on the Pacific coast.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

==History==
===Prehistoric and ancient===
People have inhabited the Niigata area ([[Furutsu Hachimanyama Site]]) since the [[Jōmon period]], though much of the current land was still beneath the sea at the time. According to the [[Nihon Shoki]], a fortress was built in the area in AD 647.
<gallery mode="packed" style="text-align: center;" caption="" heights="130px" perrow="3">
File:Furutsu Hachimanyama Site.jpg|[[Furutsu Hachimanyama Site]]
</gallery>

===Feudal period===
In the 16th century, a port called Niigata was established at the mouth of the [[Shinano River]], while a port town with the name Nuttari developed at the mouth of the [[Agano River]]. The area prospered beneath the rule of [[Uesugi Kenshin]] during the [[Sengoku Period]].

===Early modern ages===
A system of canals was constructed throughout the downtown area of Niigata port in the 17th century. During this period, the courses of the Shinano and Agano rivers gradually changed until they poured into the Sea of Japan at the same location. As a result, Niigata prospered as a port town, serving as a port of call for Japanese trade ships traversing the Sea of Japan.

The Matsugasaki Canal was constructed in 1730 to drain the Agano River area, but in 1731, flooding destroyed the canal and caused it to become the main current of the Agano River. As a result, the volume of water flowing into the port of Niigata decreased, which in turn allowed land reclamation efforts and the development of new rice fields to proceed.

</gallery>

===Late modern ages===
In 1858, Niigata was designated as one of the five ports to be opened for international trade in the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)|Japan–U.S. Treaty of Amity and Commerce]]. However, the shallow water level in the port delayed the actual opening to foreign ships until 1869. The port also served as a valuable base for fishermen who roamed as far north as the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] to catch salmon and other fish.

In 1886, the first [[Bandai Bridge]] was built across the Shinano River to connect the settlements of Niigata on the west and Nuttari on the east. Niigata annexed Nuttari in 1914.

During [[World War II]], Niigata's strategic location between the capital of [[Tokyo]] and the Sea of Japan made it a key point for the transfer of settlers and military personnel to the Asian continent, including [[Manchukuo]].

===Contemporary ages===
In 1945, near the end of the war, Niigata was one of four cities, together with Hiroshima, Kokura, and Nagasaki, picked as targets for [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bombs]] if Japan did not surrender. However, Niigata was not actually targeted in the first two missions. There were several theories about the reasons that Niigata was lowered in the priority, such as  poor weather conditions, its distance from B-29 bases in the Mariana Islands, and other factors.<ref>[http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/10/09/neglected-niigata/ Neglected Niigata | Restricted Data]</ref> 

On August 11, 1945, after the second atomic bombing in Nagasaki, the governor of Niigata Prefecture ordered the people to evacuate as concerns of an impending bombing heightened, and the city was completely deserted for days until the war ended without more atomic bombings.<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2015/08/12/niigata-ghost-town-1945_n_7980210.html 新潟がゴーストタウンになった日。知事が命じた「原爆疎開」 | ハフポスト]</ref> 

A devastating [[Typhoon Louise (1945)|Typhoon Louise]] and fire in 1955 destroyed much of the downtown area, but eventually the city recovered. In 1958, construction of the relocated [[Niigata Station]] was completed, extending the downtown area from Bandai Bridge. The [[Niigata Thermal Power Station]] Unit 1 started operation in July 1963. At that time, it was Japan's first power plant capable of using a mixture of natural gas and heavy oil.

In 1964, the old canals that flowed throughout the old downtown area were filled in to make way for more roads.

On June 16, 1964, at 13:01 [[Japan Standard Time]] an earthquake of 7.5 [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] struck the city, killing 29 people and causing large-scale property damage, with 1,960 totally destroyed buildings, 6,640 partially destroyed buildings, and 15,298 severely inundated by [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]].

In 1965, the [[Agano River]] running through Niigata was polluted with [[methylmercury]] from the chemical plant of the [[Showa Denko|Showa Electrical Company]]. Over 690 people exhibited symptoms of [[Minamata disease]] and the outbreak became known as [[Niigata Minamata disease]].

In 1982, [[Shinkansen]] service on the [[Jōetsu Shinkansen]] line began between Niigata and [[Ōmiya Station (Saitama)|Omiya]], with service to [[Ueno, Tokyo|Ueno]] added in 1985. The line was extended to Tokyo in 1991.

[[Big Swan Stadium]] in Niigata City hosted three games during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

The [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake]] did not cause any significant damage in Niigata City itself, allowing the city to work as a relief base.

The size and the population of Niigata city increased over the four-year period between 2001 and 2005, due to a series of [[municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan|municipal mergers]]. On April 1, 2007, Niigata City became first city on the west coast of Honshu to become a [[City designated by government ordinance|government-designated city]].

In July 2007, the [[2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake|Chūetsu offshore earthquake]], measuring 6.9 on Richter scale, rocked Niigata Prefecture. Though the earthquake was felt in the city, there was little damage, which allowed Niigata City to provide aid to the devastated areas.

In May 2008, the city hosted the [[34th G8 summit|2008 G8 Labor Ministers Meeting]].

On March 12, 2011, several hours after the massive 9.0 Tohoku earthquake struck off the east coast of Honshu, Niigata and Nagano Prefectures experienced an estimated magnitude 6.6 earthquake.
