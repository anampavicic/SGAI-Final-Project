It is China's [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|sixth-most populous province]], with a population of over 75 million people. [[Shijiazhuang]] is the capital city. It borders [[Shanxi]] to the west, [[Henan]] to the south, [[Shandong]] and [[Liaoning]] to the east, and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the north; in addition, Hebei entirely surrounds the [[direct-administered municipalities]] of [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] on land. Its population is 96% [[Han Chinese]], 3% [[Manchu people|Manchu]], 0.8% [[Hui people|Hui]], and 0.3% [[Mongols in China|Mongol]]. [[Varieties of Chinese]] spoken include [[Jilu Mandarin]], the [[Beijing dialect]] of Mandarin,  and [[Jin Chinese]]. 

During the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period]]s (771–226&nbsp;BC), the region was ruled by the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]]. During the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), the region was called [[Zhongshu Sheng|Zhongshu]]. It was called [[North Zhili]] during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), and simply [[Zhili Province|Zhili]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912). The modern province of Hebei was created in 1928. Five UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s can be found in the province: the [[Great Wall of China]], [[Chengde Mountain Resort]], [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], [[Eastern Qing tombs]], and [[Western Qing tombs]]. It is also home to five [[List of National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities in China|National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities]]: [[Handan]], [[Baoding]], [[Chengde]], [[Zhengding County|Zhengding]] and [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]].

Hebei's economy is based on agriculture and manufacturing; it is China's premier steel producer, which has contributed to serious air pollution.<ref>{{cite web |language=zh|script-title=zh:河北概况 |url=http://www.hebei.gov.cn/hebei/14462058/14462085/14471224/index.html |website=河北省人民政府 |access-date=2020-01-23 |archive-date=2020-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813033334/http://www.hebei.gov.cn/hebei/14462058/14462085/14471224/index.html}}</ref><ref name="工业概况">{{cite web |script-title=zh:河北省工业经济概况 |url=http://gxt.hebei.gov.cn/hbgyhxxht/xxgk6/hbsgyjjgk82/index.html |website=河北省工业和信息化厅 |access-date=2020-01-23 |archive-date=2020-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121091327/http://gxt.hebei.gov.cn/hbgyhxxht/xxgk6/hbsgyjjgk82/index.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:河北钢铁工业概况 |url=http://www.ferro-alloys.cn/News/Details/275284 |website=中国铁合金网 |access-date=2020-01-23 |archive-date=2020-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218064916/http://www.ferro-alloys.cn/News/Details/275284 |language=zh}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Hebei" means 'north of the river', derived from the province's location north of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]].<ref>{{cite web |title=我国各省份名称的由来 |url=https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20181208A0M4OV |website=腾讯网 |access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref><ref>[http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427100058/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html |date=2016-04-27 }}, People's Daily Online.</ref><ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427100058/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html |date=2016-04-27 }}, [[People's Daily Online]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yellow bridge Chinese Dictionary |url=http://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/dictionary.php |access-date=15 April 2016 |website=Yellow Bridge}}</ref> In the ''[[Yu Gong]]'', the province is recorded as "[[Jizhou (ancient China)|Jizhou]]", lending to its traditional abbreviation of "Ji" ({{zhi|s=冀}}).

The province's nickname is "Yanzhao" ({{zhi|s=燕赵}}), which is the collective name of the [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] states that controlled the region during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period]]s (771–221&nbsp;BC).<ref>{{cite web |title=河北省古称"燕赵之地"，为什么现在的简称却是"冀"呢? |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/294749251_353840|website=[[Sohu]]|access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref> In 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) moved the capital from [[Nanjing]] to [[Beijing]], and the province surrounding the new capital was first called [[North Zhili]] or [[Zhili]], meaning 'directly ruled'.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Chih-Li |volume=6 |page=133}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yongle Emperor |url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Yongle_Emperor|website=[[World History Encyclopedia]]|access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref> When Nanjing became the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1928, the province of Zhili was abolished and given its present name of Hebei.<ref>{{cite web |title=直隶省的称呼延续了几百年，1928年，为何被改成了河北省？|url=https://www.360kuai.com/pc/9b7b4962109a9be44?cota=3&kuai_so=1&sign=360_7bc3b157|website=快资讯 |access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre and early history===
[[Peking Man]], an early pre-historic [[Homo erectus]], lived on the plains of Hebei around 200,000 to 700,000 years ago. [[Neolithic]] findings at the [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] date to 7000 and 8000 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/detail.asp?ProductID=982|title=New Archaeological Discoveries and Researches in 2004 – The Fourth Archaeology Forum of CASS|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|access-date=2007-09-18|archive-date=2011-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174808/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/detail.asp?ProductID=982|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Many early [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myths]] are set in the province. [[Fuxi]], one of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]], is said to have lived in present-day [[Xingtai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gatzs.com.cn/zhms/province.action?ssdm=086130000|title=河北 – 中华名胜|publisher=内地（祖国大陆）高校面向港澳台招生信息网|access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref> The mythical [[Battle of Zhuolu]], won by the [[Yellow Emperor]], [[Yan Emperor]], and their [[Yanhuang]] tribes against the [[Chiyou]]-led Jiuli tribes, took place in [[Zhangjiakou]] and started the [[Huaxia]] civilization.

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–476 BC), Hebei was under the rule of [[State of Yan|Yan]] in the north and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] in the south. Also during this period, a nomadic people known as [[Beidi|Dí]] invaded the plains of northern China and established [[State of Zhongshan|Zhongshan]] in central Hebei. In the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC), Jin was partitioned and much of its territory in Hebei went to [[State of Zhao|Zhao]].

===Qin and Han dynasties===
The [[Qin dynasty]] unified China in 221 BC. The [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) ruled the area under two provinces, [[You Prefecture]] in the north and [[Ji Province]] in the south. At the end of the Han dynasty, most of Hebei was under the control of [[warlord]]s [[Gongsun Zan]] in the north and [[Yuan Shao]] further south. Yuan Shao emerged as the victor of the two, but he was defeated by [[Cao Cao]] in the [[Battle of Guandu]] in 200. Hebei came under the rule of the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]], established by the descendants of Cao Cao.

===Jin through the Three Kingdoms===
After the invasions of northern nomadic peoples at the end of the [[Western Jin dynasty]], chaos ensued in the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] and the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]]. Because of its location on the northern frontier, Hebei changed hands many times and was controlled at various times by [[Later Zhao]], [[Former Yan]], [[Former Qin]], and [[Later Yan]]. The [[Northern Wei]] reunified northern China in 440 but split in 534, with Hebei coming under [[Eastern Wei]]; then the [[Northern Qi]], with its capital at Ye near modern [[Linzhang]], Hebei. The [[Sui dynasty]] again unified China in 589.

[[File:Sancai Duck-Shaped Cup.jpg|thumb|200px|Tricolor Duck-Shaped Cup, Tang dynasty, unearthed from Anxin County]]
===Tang and Five dynasties===
During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the area was officially called Hebei for the first time. The [[Yan (An–Shi)|Great Yan]] State was established in Hebei from 756 to 763 during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]. After the rebellion, [[Lulong Jiedushi]] retained its autonomy from Tang during most of the 9th century. During the late [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], Lulong was fragmented among several regimes including the short-lived [[Yan (Five Dynasties period)|Yan]]. It was eventually annexed in 913 by [[Li Cunxu]], who established the [[Later Tang]] (923–936). Emperor [[Gaozu of Later Jin|Gaozu of the Later Jin dynasty]] ceded much of northern Hebei to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]]. This territory, called the [[Sixteen Prefectures]] of Yanyun, became a weakness in the Chinese defense against the Khitans for the next century because it lay within the [[Great Wall]].

===Song through Yuan dynasties===
During the [[Northern Song dynasty]] (960–1127), the sixteen ceded prefectures continued to be an area of contention between Song China and the Liao dynasty. Later, the [[Southern Song dynasty]] abandoned all of [[North China]], including Hebei, to the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jurchen Jin dynasty]] after the 1127 [[Jingkang Incident]] of the [[Jin campaigns against the Song dynasty|Jin–Song wars]]. Hebei was heavily affected by the flooding of the Yellow River; between 1048 and 1128, the river ran directly through the province rather than to its south.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zhang|first=Ling|title=The River, the Plain, and the State: An Environmental Drama in Northern Song China, 1048-1128|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781107155985|location=Cambridge|pages=1–4|language=English}}</ref>

The [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] divided China into provinces but did not establish Hebei as a province. Instead, the area was directly administrated by the Secretariat at the capital [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]].

===Ming and Qing dynasties===
The [[Ming dynasty]] ruled Hebei as Beizhili, meaning Northern Directly Ruled because the area contained and was directly ruled by the imperial capital in [[Beijing]]. The "Northern" designation was used because there was a southern counterpart covering present-day [[Jiangsu]] and [[Anhui]]. When the [[Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] came to power in 1644, they abolished the southern counterpart, and Hebei became known as [[Zhili Province|Zhili]] or Directly Ruled. During the Qing dynasty, the northern borders of Zhili extended deep into [[Inner Mongolia]] and overlapped in jurisdiction with the [[Leagues of China|league]]s of Inner Mongolia.

===Republic of China===
[[File:Hbeisheng.jpg|thumb|Hebei in 2022]]
The Qing dynasty [[Xinhai Revolution|collapsed]] in 1912 and was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In a few years, China descended into a civil war, with regional warlords vying for power. Since Zhili was so close to the capital of [[Beijing]], it was the site of the [[Zhiwan War]], the [[First Zhifeng War]], and the [[Second Zhifeng War]]. With the success of the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] in 1926 and 1927 by the [[Kuomintang]], the capital was moved from Beijing to [[Nanjing]]. As a result, the province's name was changed to Hebei, reflecting the relocation of the capital and its standard provincial administration.

During the [[World War II]], Hebei was under the control of the [[Wang Jingwei regime|Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China]], a [[puppet state]] of [[Imperial Japan]].

===People's Republic of China===
The founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] saw several changes. The region around [[Chengde]], previously part of [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] Province (historically part of [[Manchuria]]), and the region around [[Zhangjiakou]], previously part of [[Chahar (province)|Chahar]] Province (historically part of [[Inner Mongolia]]), were merged into Hebei. This extended its borders northwards beyond the Great Wall. Meanwhile, the city of [[Puyang]] was carved away, causing Hebei to lose access to the [[Yellow River]]. The city became part of the short-lived [[Pingyuan Province]] before eventually being annexed into [[Henan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=濮阳地区一直属于河北省，1952年，为何划归给了河南省？|url=https://www.sohu.com/a/205316427_628936|website=[[Sohu]]|access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref>

The capital was also moved from [[Baoding]] to the new city of [[Shijiazhuang]], and, for a short period, to [[Tianjin]]. On July 28, 1976, [[Tangshan]] was struck by the [[Tangshan earthquake]], the deadliest earthquake of the 20th century, killing over 240,000 people. There were a series of smaller earthquakes in the following decade.

Today, Hebei, along with [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] municipalities which it includes, make up the [[Jing-Jin-Ji]] megalopolis region. With a population of 130 million, it is about six times the size of the [[New York metropolitan area]] and is one of the largest megalopolis clusters in China.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/20/world/asia/in-china-a-supercity-rises-around-beijing.html |title=In China, a Supercity Rises Around Beijing |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |first=Ian |last=Johnson |date=July 19, 2015 }}</ref> Beijing had also unloaded some of its non-capital functions to the province with the establishment of the [[Xiong'an]] New Area, which integrates the three municipalities.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/xiongan-new-area-beijing-tianjin-hebei |title=Xiong'an New Area: President Xi's Dream City |newspaper=China Briefing |first=Frank |last=Wong |date=March 16, 2019 |access-date=April 2, 2020 |archive-date=August 2, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220802060649/https://www.china-briefing.com/news/xiongan-new-area-beijing-tianjin-hebei/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Geography==
Hebei is the only province in China to contain plateaus, mountains, hills, shorelines, plains, and lakes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sohu.com/a/124048424_384784|title=全国唯一兼有高原、山地、丘陵、海滨、湖泊的省份 |publisher=[[Sohu]]|access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref> Most of central and southern Hebei lies within the [[North China Plain]]. Western Hebei rises into the [[Taihang Mountains]] (Taihang Shan), while the [[Yan Mountains]] (Yan Shan) runs through northern Hebei. Beyond the mountains are the [[Mongolian–Manchurian grassland|grasslands]] of [[Inner Mongolia]]. The highest peak is [[Mount Xiaowutai]] in [[Yu County, Hebei|Yu County]] in the northwest of the province, with an altitude of {{convert|2882|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Mt Xwt Dili 360" />

Hebei borders the [[Bohai Sea]] on the east. The [[Hai River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] covers most of the province's central and southern parts; the [[Luan River]] watershed covers the northeast. Excluding manmade reservoirs, the largest lake in Hebei is [[Baiyangdian]], located in [[Anxin County]], [[Baoding]].

Major cities in Hebei include: [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Baoding]], [[Tangshan]], [[Qinhuangdao]], [[Handan]][[Zhangjiakou|, and Zhangjiakou]].

Hebei has a [[monsoon]]-influenced humid [[humid continental climate|continental]] climate. Its winters are cold and dry, while its summers are hot and humid. Temperatures average {{convert|−16|to|−3|°C|°F}} in January and {{convert|20|to|27|°C|°F}} in July.

==Economy==
In 2014, Hebei's [[Gross domestic product|gross domestic product (GDP)]] was 2.942 trillion yuan (US$479 billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2012/01/27/chinas-provincial-gdp-figures-in-2011.html|title=China's Provincial GDP Figures in 2011 – China Briefing News|date=27 January 2012}}</ref> It is ranked sixth in the [[PRC]], with its [[GDP per capita]] reaching 40,124 [[renminbi]]. As of 2011, the [[primary sector of industry|primary]], [[secondary sector of industry|secondary]], and [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] sectors of industry contributed 203.46 billion, 877.74 billion, and 537.66 billion [[Rmb|RMB]] respectively. The registered urban [[unemployment rate]] was 3.96%.

Hebei's industries include [[textiles]], [[coal]], [[steel]], [[iron]], engineering, chemical production, petroleum, power, [[ceramic]]s, and food. 40% of Hebei's labor force works in the agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry sectors, with the majority of production from these industries going to [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]. Hebei's main agricultural products are [[cereal]] crops, including [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[millet]], and [[sorghum]]. [[Cash crop]]s like [[cotton]], [[peanut]], [[soybean]]s and [[sesame]] are also produced.

Hebei has abundant natural resources. The [[Kailuan]] mine in [[Tangshan]], with a history of over 100 years, is one of China's first modern [[coal]] mines. It remains active, with an annual production of over 20 million metric tonnes. Much of the [[:zh:华北油田|North China Oilfied]] is within Hebei. There are major iron mines at [[Handan]] and [[Qian'an, Hebei|Qian'an]]. Iron and steel manufacturing are the largest industries in Hebei.

==Culture==

===Language===
People speak dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] across the Hebei, with most classified as part of the [[Ji Lu Mandarin]] subdivision of Chinese. Along the western border with [[Shanxi]], dialects are distinct enough for linguists to consider them as part of [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], another subdivision of Chinese. In general, the dialects of Hebei are similar to the [[Beijing dialect]], which forms the basis for [[Standard Chinese]] and the official language of the nation. However, there are also some distinct differences, such as the pronunciation of some words, made by [[entering tone]] syllables (syllables ending on a [[plosive consonant|plosive]]) in [[Middle Chinese]].

===Arts===

Traditional forms of [[Chinese opera]] in Hebei include [[Pingju]], [[Hebei Bangzi]] (Hebei Clapper Opera), and [[Cangzhou]] [[Kuaibanshu|Kuaiban Dagu]]. Pingju is especially popular because it tends to use colloquial language which is easier for audiences to understand. Originating from northeastern Hebei, Pingju was influenced by other forms of Chinese opera such as [[Beijing opera]]. Traditionally Pingju has a ''[[Sheng (Chinese opera)|xiaosheng]]'' (young male lead), a ''[[Dan (Chinese opera)|xiaodan]]'' (young female lead), and a ''[[Chou (Chinese opera)|xiaohualian]]'' (young comic character), though it has diversified to include other roles.<ref>{{cite web |title=评剧、河北梆子|url=http://182.92.234.121:8081/project/res/public.html?ename=44zgxqwh&second=3.%E8%AF%84%E5%89%A7%E3%80%81%E6%B2%B3%E5%8C%97%E6%A2%86%E5%AD%90|website=中华传统文化数字资源库系统|access-date=2021-01-10}}</ref>

[[Quyang County]], in central Hebei, is noted for [[Ding ware]], a type of [[Chinese ceramics]] which includes various vessels such as bowls, plates, vases, and cups, as well as figurines. Ding ware is usually creamy white, though it is also made in other colors.

===Cuisine===
Hebei cuisine is typically based on wheat, mutton, and beans. The [[donkey burger]], originating from the cities of [[Baoding]] and [[Hejian]], [[Cangzhou]], is a staple in provincial cuisine and has spread into the two municipalities. Other dishes include local variants of [[shaobing]].

===Entertainment===
[[Beidaihe]], located near Shanhaiguan, is a popular beach resort.

===Architectural and cultural sites===

The [[Ming Great Wall]] crosses the northern part of Hebei, and its eastern end is located on the coast at [[Shanhai Pass|Shanhaiguan]] (Shanhai Pass), near [[Qinhuangdao]]. Informally known as the First Pass of The World, Shanhaiguan Pass was where Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] opened the gates to Manchu forces in 1644, beginning nearly 300 years of Manchu rule.

The [[Chengde Mountain Resort]] and its outlying temples are a [[World Heritage Site]]. Also known as the Rehe Palace, this was the summer resort of the Manchu [[Qing dynasty]] emperors. The resort was built between 1703 and 1792. It consists of a palace complex and a large park with lakes, pavilions, causeways, and bridges. There are also several Tibetan Buddhist and Han Chinese temples in the surrounding area.

[[File:避暑山庄小金山.jpg|thumb|[[Chengde Mountain Resort]]]]

There are Qing dynasty imperial [[tomb]]s at [[Zunhua]] ([[Eastern Qing Tombs]]) and [[Yi County, Hebei|Yixian]] ([[West Qing Tombs]]). The Eastern Qing Tombs are the resting place of 161 Qing emperors, empresses, and other members of the Qing imperial family, while the West Qing Tombs have 76 burials. Both tomb complexes are part of a [[World Heritage Site]].

The [[Zhao County|Zhaozhou]], or [[Anji Bridge]], was built by Li Chun during the [[Sui dynasty]] and is the oldest stone [[arch bridge]] in China. It is one of the most significant examples of pre-modern Chinese [[civil engineering]]. [[Baoding]], the old provincial capital, contains the historic Zhili governor's residence and the former court.

[[Xibaipo]], a village about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} from [[Shijiazhuang]] in [[Pingshan County, Hebei|Pingshan County]], was the location of the [[Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party]] and the headquarters of the [[People's Liberation Army]] during the decisive stages of the [[Chinese Civil War]] between May 26, 1948, and March 23, 1949. Today, the area houses a memorial site.<ref>{{citation |author=Kenneth Pomeranz |title=Musings on a Museum: A Trip to Xibaipo |date=July 22, 2010 |url=http://www.thechinabeat.org/?p=2384 |author-link=Kenneth Pomeranz}}</ref>
