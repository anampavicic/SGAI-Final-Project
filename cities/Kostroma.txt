'''Kostroma''' ({{langx|ru|Кострома́}}, {{IPA|ru|kəstrɐˈma|IPA}}) is a historic [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Kostroma Oblast]], [[Russia]]. A part of the [[Golden Ring of Russia|Golden Ring]] of Russian cities, it is located at the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[Volga]] and [[Kostroma (river)|Kostroma]]. In the 2021 census, the population is 267,481.

==History==
===Under the Rurikids===
The official founding year of the city is 1152 by [[Yury Dolgoruky]].<ref name="Founded">Official website of Kostroma. [http://www.gradkostroma.ru/en/kostroma_today/ Kostroma Today]</ref> Since many scholars believe that early Eastern Slavs tribes arrived in modern-day  Belarus, Ukraine and western Russia AD 400 to 600, Kostroma could be much older than previously thought.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/early-east-slavic-tribes-in-russia.html |title=Early East Slavic Tribes in Russia {{!}} Study.com |work=Study.com |access-date=2018-09-13 |language=en}}</ref>

The city has the same name as the East Slavic goddess [[Kostroma (deity)|Kostroma]].

Like other towns of the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Eastern Rus]], Kostroma was sacked by the [[Mongols]] in 1238. It then constituted a small principality, under leadership of Prince [[Vasily of Kostroma]], a younger brother of the famous [[Alexander Nevsky]]. Upon inheriting the grand ducal title in 1271, Vasily didn't leave the town for [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and his descendants ruled Kostroma for another half a century, until the town was bought by [[Ivan I of Moscow]].{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

[[File:Кострома - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|[[Ipatievsky Monastery]], 2009|alt=|left]]

As one of the northernmost towns of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], Kostroma served for grand dukes as a place of retreat when enemies besieged [[Moscow]] in 1382, 1408, and 1433. In 1375, the town was looted by [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] pirates (''[[ushkuiniks]]''). The spectacular growth{{quantify|date=October 2022}} of the city in the 16th century may be attributed to the establishment of trade connections with English and Dutch merchants ([[Muscovy Company]]) through the northern port of [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]]. [[Boris Godunov]] had the [[Ipatiev Monastery|Ipatiev]]<ref name="Kostromka">Local History website. [http://kostromka.ru/torop/kostroma/en.php K. Torop. Kostroma]</ref> and Epiphany monasteries rebuilt in stone. The construction works were finished just in time for the city to witness some of the most dramatic events of the [[Time of Troubles]].{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

The heroic peasant [[Ivan Susanin]] became a symbol of the city's resistance to foreign invaders;{{dubious|date=October 2016}} several monuments to him may be seen in Kostroma. The future Tsar, [[Michael I of Russia|Mikhail Romanov]], also lived at the monastery. It was here that an embassy from [[Moscow]] offered him the Russian crown in 1612.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

===Under the Romanovs===
A wooden house of Mikhail Romanov is still preserved in the monastery. There are also several old wooden structures transported to the monastery walls from distant districts of the [[Kostroma Oblast]].{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

[[File:MapKostromi1907-1024.jpg|thumb|Plan of Kostroma, 1907]]
In 1773, Kostroma was devastated by a great fire. Afterwards the city was rebuilt with streets radiating from a single focal point near the river. They{{who|date=June 2012}} say that [[Catherine the Great]] dropped her fan on the [[city map]], and told the architects to follow her design. One of the best preserved examples of the 18th century [[town planning]], Kostroma retains some elegant structures in a "[[neoclassicism|provincial neoclassical]]" style. These include a governor's palace, a fire tower, a rotunda on the Volga [[Dike (construction)|embankment]], and an [[Kostroma Gostiny Dvor|arcaded central market]] with a merchant church in the center.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

===During and after the Russian Revolution===
The First Workers' Socialist Club based in Kostroma was one of the best documented workers' clubs run by [[Proletkult]]. Organised around the principle of a "public hearth" (obshchestvennyi ochag) this club combined both practical support for workers in need of accommodation, food or furniture, as well as providing a focus for popular education.

===Nuclear power referendum===
The Nuclear Power Referendum was arranged in 1990 in the Kostroma area. 90% of the voting population were against [[nuclear power]] in the area.<ref>Teoksessa Venäjän ihmisoikeusliike Gaudeamus Helsinki 2007</ref> A [[Kostroma Nuclear Power Plant]] has been proposed.

==Administrative and municipal status==
[[File:Administration-kostroma.jpg|thumb|City Hall, July 2009]]

== Sights and landmarks ==
[[File:minster st ipatios.jpg|thumb|[[Ipatiev Monastery]] gives its name to the [[Hypatian Codex]] of the [[Russian Primary Chronicle]]. Photo by [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky]], 1911]]
[[File:Kostroma-resurrection.jpg|thumb|The [[Church of the Resurrection, Kostroma|Resurrection Church]] (1652) is an example of 17th-century Russian art. Color photograph by [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky]] in 1910 ([[Library of Congress]])]]

Built in 1559–1565, the five-domed [[Theophany Monastery, Kostroma|Epiphany Cathedral]] was the first stone edifice in the city; its medieval [[fresco]]es perished during a fire several years ago. The minster houses the city's most precious relic, a 10th-century [[Eastern Orthodox|Byzantine]] [[icon]] called [[Our Lady of St. Theodore]]. It was with this icon that Mikhail Romanov was blessed by his mother when he left for Moscow to claim the Russian throne. They{{who|date=June 2012}} say that just before the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]], the icon blackened so badly that the image was hardly visible; it was interpreted as a bad sign for the Romanov dynasty.

The Ipatyevsky monastery survives mostly intact, with its 16th-century walls, towers, [[Bell tower|belfry]], and the 17th-century [[cathedral]].

Apart from the monasteries, most of the city churches were either rebuilt or demolished during the Soviet years. The only city church that survives from the 17th-century "golden age" is the [[Church of the Resurrection, Kostroma|Resurrection church on the Lowlands]] (Russian: церковь Воскресения на Дебре). As the story goes, the church was commissioned by one merchant who ordered in [[England]] ten barrels of dye but received ten barrels of gold instead. He resolved that the unearned gold was the devil's gift and decided to spend it on building a church. Two other 17th-century temples, of rather conventional architecture, may be seen on the opposite side of the Volga.

Among the vestiges of the Godunov rule, a fine [[tented roof|tent-like church]] in the [[urban-type settlement]] of [[Krasnoye-na-Volge]] (formerly an estate of Boris Godunov's brother) may be recommended.

==Transportation==
The city is served by the [[Kostroma Airport]]. Since 1887 there has been a railway connection between Kostroma and Moscow.<ref>{{cite web |title=Train Station in Kostroma |url=http://www.nnov-airport.ru/rus/wokzal_kostroma.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323172106/http://www.nnov-airport.ru/rus/wokzal_kostroma.html |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |access-date=December 2, 2012 |language=ru}}</ref>
