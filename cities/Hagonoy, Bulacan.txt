'''Hagonoy''', officially the '''Municipality of Hagonoy''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Hagonoy}}, [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Balen ning Hagonoy''), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 133,448 people.{{PH census|current}}

==History==
HAGONOY was first mentioned in the history of the Philippines in 1571. Even before the "blood compact" between the [[Spain]]'s conqueror [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]] and the Philippines' [[Datu Sikatuna]] was made, the place was already known as Hagonoy. The land consists of archipelagic marsh and river tributaries going to the sea, where the first ancestors of this town probably took this way to reach Hagonoy.

Hagonoy first appeared in Philippine history when they formed part of the fleet of [[Tarik Sulayman]] of [[Macabebe, Pampanga]] that met [[Martin de Goiti]] at the [[Battle of Bangkusay Channel|Battle of Bangkusay]] in the initial defense of the [[Luzon|Lusong]] against the Spaniards in 1571.<ref>Gaspar de San Agustin, Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas 1565-1615, Translated by Luis Antonio Mañeru, 1st bilingual ed [Spanish and English], published by Pedro Galende, OSA: Intramuros, Manila, 1998.</ref>

In the beginning, Hagonoy was part of Alcaldia de [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]] as its visita together with [[Apalit]]. It has huge convent having founded on April 22, 1581, with Fray Diego Ordonez de Vivar as its first minister according to Gaspar's "Conquistas delas Islas" Book 2 (Fray Diego having credited for the christiniazation of [[Calumpit]], [[Malolos]] and [[Bulakan]]). At first, it was also included in the territorial part of Encomienda de Calumpit that was given by Governor General Gonzalo Ronquillo to Sargento Juan de Moron for his good service and loyalty to Spanish Crown. Sargento Juan Moron once trusted his land to the Augustinian friars, and that's how it was handed to Fray Diego Vivar. It is also noted that on the primary sources documents such as Miguel de Loarca's "Relacion delas Islas" written in 1582 and Luis Perez de Dasmarinas report on King of Spain in June 1591 didn't mention Hagonoy as an independent encomienda or town, instead it is simultaneously with the much older town of Calumpit and it was officially established as a civil town in May 1671. According to records and old folks, there were already inhabitants in some places of this settlement.These places were Tibaguin and Pugad, coastal barrios sharing the coastline with the City of [[Malolos]] and towns of [[Bulakan]], [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]] and the City of [[Manila]].

[[Magat Salamat]], a revolutionary hero, and the last Prince of the [[Kingdom of Tondo]], once headed this town.<ref name="geocities1">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/globalistmanifesto2/lakandula.html |title=lakandula |access-date=2008-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224230925/http://www.geocities.com/globalistmanifesto2/lakandula.html|archive-date=2008-02-24}}</ref> He was the ancestor of the Salamat families now living in different barrios of this town.

===Origin of the name===
The town was named after the "hagunoy" ''([[Chromolaena odorata]])'', a medicinal plant that used to be abundant in its river banks and along the seashores. The original populace used its leaves as their herbal remedy of choice for common illnesses and as food ingredients. Because of the medicinal value of the plant, the news of its effectiveness spread leading the people to call the place "Hagonoy".

===Hagonoy's town legend===
In the 16th century, some friars took a boat from Manila to the province of Bulacan and reached what was then called "Quinabaloan" (from [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] word ''kinabaluan'' meaning "had been known" or "pinag-alaman" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]—which was then still part of the town of Calumpit and is now the barangays of Santa Monica and San Jose). At that time, a very charming lass was so popular among the young men of the locality. She had many suitors and admirers. One day, she felt ill and she needed someone to get leaves of the hagonoy plant by the river (which is now called Sapang Pari because the friars and priests used this river to commute).

A man offered to promptly get some leaves of the plant and in deep gratitude, she promised to marry him. As he was gathering the leaves of the hagunoy plant for his dearly beloved, the group of friars in a passing boat stopped to ask him, "Quien vive?" (Where are we?). The man did not understand Spanish and was extremely intimidated by the ''guardia civil'' (Spanish civil guard) that escorted the friars. Thinking that they were asking what he was grasping in his hands, he quickly retorted "Hagunoy po!" (Hagunoy, sir!) and scampered away.

These were the first Augustinian friars that got into town and they noted the place's name as "Hagonoy". Hence, the origin of the illustrious town's name.<ref>Jose A. Salazar, 1981</ref>

==Geography==
With a total land area of 103.10 square kilometers, Hagonoy is situated at the south-west corner of the province of [[Bulacan]]. It is bounded by the municipality of [[Calumpit]] on the north, municipality of [[Paombong]] on the east, municipality of [[Masantol, Pampanga]] on the west and [[Manila Bay]] on the south. The municipality is approximately 54 kilometers from [[Metro Manila]] or about an hour and a half drive. It can be accessed via [[North Luzon Expressway]] and [[MacArthur Highway]].

Hagonoy is a long ridge with a lake on its edge by Manila Bay called "Wawa", which is now part of Barangays San Sebastian and San Nicolas. It is basically a fishing town with Manila Bay as its proximate fishing ground, which extends up to the provinces of [[Pampanga]], [[Bataan]], and [[Cavite]]. Its more adventurous fisherfolk brave the waves of the [[South China Sea]] northward and cross into the [[Philippine Sea]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the eastern seaboard where they cast their nets and haul their catch to the fishing ports of [[Quezon province]].

===Barangays===
[[File:Hagonoy map brgy clusters en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Barangay clusters of Hagonoy]]
Hagonoy is politically subdivided into 26 barangays grouped into 5 clusters or ''kumpol'' for statistical purposes. All barangays are classified as urban by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

==Economy==
{{PH poverty incidence}}
Hagonoy is mainly a fishing municipality with 7,837.65 hectares devoted to fish farming or about three-fourths of its total land area. It is home to about 1,423 fishpond operators and 55 registered consignacions – a venue for trading [[aquaculture]] products. The town offers a variety of harvests which includes prawns, shrimps, milkfish, tilapia, crabs, mussels and oysters.

With its abundant water resources and the coastal nature of the town, the majority of the population is dependent on the fishing industry. Even the municipal government has its own fishpond locally known as "Propyus", situated in Pugad and Tibaguin, two coastal barangays of Hagonoy along the coast of Manila Bay. It is subdivided to 7 lots with a combined lot area of 412 hectares of municipal waters.

Two local fish ports called "pundohan" – one in barrio San Nicolas and the other at the Poblacion, are the busiest commercial areas in the town. Fish traders from [[Lucena]] and [[Dagupan]] among other merchants of other provinces are regular bulk buyers the local ports or at the private "consignacions" (brokerage) of the large milkfish growers.

The coastal barrios are virtually 24/7 as fishermen go out to the sea at night for hours or even days while their loving families and relatives await them. Upon their return, their catch is immediately sorted out and sold at the local public markets and "talipapa" of the barangays. Their catch are also transported to the public markets in nearby towns and up to the public/private markets and supermarkets in Metro Manila.

Barangay Santo Niño adjacent to the Poblacion is host to the numerous brokers of prawns for the domestic and export markets. The boats that sell their prawn catch at these brokers at times come from as far as the province of [[Capiz]].

She is enshrined at the church named after her in the poblacion. This church is a National Shrine. There are also small fiestas among the different ''purok''s of the ''barangay''s, there are feasts for the: Sacred Heart of Jesus, Our Lady of the Rosary, and other commemorative feasts of the Catholic Church. The [[Holy Week]] observance includes self flagellants on the road, zarzuelas, the "pabasa" (the passion sang as a psalm), the [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter]] dawn processions, in all parish churches. The Good Friday processions of the Parishes like the Poblacion and the Santo Rosario parishes are attended by at least 15 to 30 Lenten icons. The fiestas and Holy Week rituals are deemed as a sacred tradition. Some barangays hold their feasts with extraordinary roadside decorations and buntings so elaborate that the road is almost covered with overhead decor sufficient to screen-off the sunlight at noontime.

Major Fiestas in Hagonoy such as the Santo Niño Fiesta, Santa Elena Fiesta, & the Town’s Fiesta & Foundation Day are some of the major festivities in town.
