==History==
[[Image:Nha Van Hoa Lao Dong Thai Binh.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The Workers' House of Culture]]
In the 10th century, the area was the domain of the Tran clan, which rose in power to become the [[Trần Dynasty]] of Vietnam in the early 13th century. The town Thái Bình (Sino-Vietnamese: 太平) developed near the [[Keo Pagoda]] constructed in 1061.

Before the prime minister declared it a city in June 2004, Thai Binh was officially a town. The city is the center of economics and culture in its province. [[Thai Binh Medical College]] is considered one of the highest quality [[Medicine|medical]] colleges in Vietnam.<ref>''BMJ: British Medical Journal'' - Volume 313, Issues 7061-7072 1996- Page 1115 "Data from Thai Binh reproductive health survey, April 1992, on 347 mothers delivering for first time from April 1987 to ...
