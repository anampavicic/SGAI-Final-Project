== 2015 terrorist attack ==
{{Main|Garissa University College attack}}
On 2 April 2015, gunmen stormed the Garissa University College, killing 147 people and injuring at least 79. The militant group and Al-Qaeda offshoot, [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] claimed responsibility for the attack. The gunmen took over 700 students hostage, freeing Muslims and killing those who identified as Christians. The siege ended the same day when all four of the attackers were killed. Five men were later arrested in connection with the attack, and a bounty was placed for the arrest of a suspected organizer, Mohamed Mahmoud, also known as Dulyadeyn.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Dulyadeyn was later killed by U.S.-trained Somali commandos from the Somali National Army on the night of May 31, 2016, in Bulo Gadud, a town loyal to Al-Shabaab, about 30 kilometers north of the port of Kismayo in Somalia.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The Garissa University attack was the second deadliest terrorist attack in Kenyan history since independence (after the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] in Nairobi, in which 213 people were killed).

==Governance==
As the capital of [[Garissa County]], Garissa is the seat of the County Government of Garissa as well as the County Assembly. The Governor of the county is Nathif Jama.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Governor – Garissa County Government|url=http://garissa.go.ke/staff/governor/|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref> The city is represented by [[Aden Bare Duale]], a Somali [[Member of Parliament (Kenya)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Garissa Township Constituency]] in the [[National Assembly of Kenya]]. He was elected to the position in the Kenya National Assembly through the [[United Republican Party (Kenya)|United Republican Party]], an affiliate party of the [[Jubilee Alliance]]. He currently serves as the Majority Leader in the Parliament. During the colonial era, Garissa, as well as other parts of NFD, were collectively conferred to as the British East Africa province of ''Trans-juba'', and would subsequently be referred to as [[Jubaland]], which split into two in the mid 1920s.<ref>Mwangi, Oscar Gakuo. "Jubaland: Somalia’s new security dilemma and state-building efforts." Africa Review 8.2 (2016): 120-132.</ref>

==Climate==
Garissa has a [[hot arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), despite receiving around {{convert|375|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rainfall per year, due to the extremely high potential evapotranspiration. Garissa's landscape is mostly arid, desert terrain. The city lies along the Tana River, and has a hot climate due to the low elevation and distance from cooler coastal areas. The daytime temperature typically rises above {{convert|33|C|F|1|disp=or}} every day, but cools down every night.
