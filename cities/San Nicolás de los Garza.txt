'''San Nicolás de los Garza''', sometimes known only as '''San Nicolás''', is a [[city]] and coextensive [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Nuevo León]] that is part of the [[Monterrey metropolitan area]]. It has become primarily a city for residences and family houses, although it still has several factories that tend to relocate to the periphery of the metropolitan area. It is the fifth-largest city in the state, behind Monterrey, [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León|Guadalupe]], [[Apodaca|Ciudad Apodaca]] and [[General Escobedo]].

It houses the [[Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León]] (Autonomous University of Nuevo León), one of the most prestigious public schools in [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]].

San Nicolás, although less populated than Monterrey, has the higher population density.

==History==
San Nicolás de los Garza was founded on 5 February 1597 and given the name of ''Estancia de Pedro de la Garza'' (Pedro de la Garza’s Estate), then ''Estancia de San Nicolás'' (''Saint Nicholas’ Estate''), and finally ''Estancia de San Nicolás de los Garza'' (''Saint Nicholas of the Garzas’ Estate''). {{Citation needed span|The first people that inhabited the terrain were [[Amerindian]], mostly nomads. They were the [[Alazapa]]s, the [[Ayala people|Ayala]]s and the [[Alincheño]]s. |reason=Did really those peoples ever existed? |date= May 2014}}

San Nicolás was founded right after [[Monterrey]], when [[Diego de Montemayor]] granted permission to inhabit the area to his secretary, [[Diego Díaz de Berlanga]]; Pedro de Iñigo; Domingo Manuel; and {{abbr|D.|Don}}&nbsp;Pedro de la Garza. The members of these families are considered the first settlers of the city.

Diego Díaz de Berlanga was the person that redacted Monterrey's Foundation Act, and authorized the first land permissions to its first settlers.

In 1830 the area was declared to the category of village, with the name of San Nicolás de los Garza, in honor of the patron saint of the town. On 12 May 1970 it was declared a city.

==Government==
San Nicolás de los Garza is a municipality governed by a democratically elected ''Presidente Municipal'' (Municipal President or Mayor) for three years with no right to reelection. The political environment is one of civility. Since the 1980s, the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] has remained in office.

The City Council of San Nicolás de los Garza (''Cabildo de San Nicolás de los Garza'') is an organ integrated by the mayor, the ''Regidores'' and the ''Síndicos''. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of the public municipal administration. The ''Regidores'' represent the community and their mission is to collectively define the city policies in all the subjects affecting it. The ''Síndicos'' are in charge of watching and legally defend the city interests, as well as in charge of watching the City Treasury status and the municipal patrimony.

The current mayor of San Nicolás is Pedro Salgado Almaguer  ([[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]]), who was elected in the past municipal election and will remain in office until 2016.

The political parties with representation in the city are the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI]], the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party or PAN]], the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD]], the [[Labor Party (Mexico)|Labor Party or PT]], the [[PVEM|Green Party]], [[Convergencia|Convergence]], [[Socialdemocratic Party]], and [[Nueva Alianza]].

==Economy==
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Cemex.logo.gif|right|thumb|Cemex still has facilities in the city]] -->
In the first part of the 20th century, several important Mexican companies built factories in the municipality, making San Nicolás primarily an industrial center. Companies like [[Cemex]] (concrete), [[Vitro]] (glass), [[Peñoles]], and Hylsa (steel) were known for their large facilities in the city.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

In the 1970s, San Nicolás increased its reputation as a good place to live, and the municipality experienced a tide of house construction. This house construction boom was possible because there were a lot of lands available within the territory of the city. In the 1980s several industrial facilities moved to other municipalities, mainly to Apodaca, which is still within the Monterrey Metropolitan Area, but farther from downtown.

At the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, huge commercial centers or malls were constructed to serve the large population. The first economic activity became commerce instead of industrial production. The most important malls are La Fe (east), Citadel (east), Las Plazas Outlet (northwest), Plaza Fiesta Anahuac (south), Sendero (North) and Universidad Avenue. The city count with several commercial centers in construction.{{cn|date=April 2023}}
