Cartagena has been inhabited for over two millennia, being founded around 227 BC<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ayto-cartagena.es/frontend/pagina/_xzuM2Hlr2V_Gp6yszA4zZ27GcAZyjSUJuNr0pzP0gH8 |title=Callejero {{pipe}} Ayuntamiento de Cartagena |publisher=Ayto-cartagena.es |access-date=26 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701224836/http://www.ayto-cartagena.es/frontend/pagina/_xzuM2Hlr2V_Gp6yszA4zZ27GcAZyjSUJuNr0pzP0gH8 |archive-date=1 July 2012}}</ref> by the [[Carthaginians|Carthaginian]] military leader [[Hasdrubal the Fair]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.livius.org/ha-hd/hasdrubal/hasdrubal2.html |title=Hasdrubal the Fair - Livius |website=www.livius.org |access-date=26 March 2020 |archive-date=5 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005185532/https://www.livius.org/ha-hd/hasdrubal/hasdrubal2.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> as '''''Qart Hadasht''''' ({{lang-phn|ê§íê§ìê§ïê§üê§áê§Éê§îê§ï QRTê§ü·∏§D≈†T}}; meaning "New Town"), the same name as the original city of [[Carthage]]. The city reached its peak under the [[Hispania|Roman Empire]], when it was known as '''''Carthago Nova''''' ('''New Carthage''') and '''''Carthago Spartaria''''', capital of the province of [[Cartaginense|Carthaginensis]].

Much of the historical significance of Cartagena stemmed from its coveted defensive port, one of the most important in the western Mediterranean. Cartagena has been the capital of the [[Structure of the Spanish Navy in the 21st century|Spanish Navy's Maritime Department of the Mediterranean]] since the arrival of the [[House of Bourbon|Spanish Bourbons]] in the 18th century.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web |url=https://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871 |title=Historia de Cartagena - Regi√≥n de Murcia Digital |language=es |access-date=1 February 2020 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727085549/https://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871 |url-status=live}}</ref> As far back as the 16th century it was one of the most important naval ports in Spain, together with [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] in the North.

The confluence of civilizations, its strategic harbor, and the influence of the local mining industry have led to a unique historic, architectural and artistic heritage. This heritage is reflected in a number of landmarks of Cartagena, including the [[Roman theatre, Cartagena|Roman Theatre]], an abundance of [[Phoenician art#Art|Phoenician]], [[Roman art|Roman]], [[Byzantine art and architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] remains, and a plethora of [[Art Nouveau]] buildings from the early 20th century. Cartagena is now established as a major cruise ship destination<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apc.es/varios/boletin.asp?idnot=527669 |title=Autoridad Portuaria de Cartagena |publisher=Apc.es |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908075644/http://www.apc.es/varios/boletin.asp?idnot=527669 |archive-date=8 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> in the Mediterranean and an emerging cultural focus.

It was the first of a number of cities that have been named Cartagena, most notably [[Cartagena, Colombia]].

==Geography and climate==

===Geography and relief===
The city of Cartagena is located in the southeastern region of Spain in the [[Campo de Cartagena]].
The Cartagena region can be viewed as a great plain inclined slightly in the direction NW-SE, bordered at the north and the northwest by pre-coastal mountain ranges (Carrascoy, El Puerto, Los Villares, Columbares and Escalona), and at the south and southwest by coastal mountain ranges (El Algarrobo, La Muela, Pelayo, Gorda, La Fausilla y Minera, with its last spurs in [[Cape Palos]]).

The dominant geology of the region is metamorphic (slate, marble) and sedimentary (limestone). The most widely present kind of soil is calcic xerosol. Other soils that occur in the municipality are the [[leptosol]], which forms the Mediterranean coast, and the petrocalcic xerosol.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Atlas Global de la Regi√≥n de Murcia |pages=187 |language=es}}</ref>

The city is located just at the end of the new AP-7 motorway. The following villages are part of Cartagena municipality: [[La Azoh√≠a]], [[Isla Plana]], [[Los Urrutias]] and [[Los Nietos, Cartagena|Los Nietos]].

The Old Town is limited by five small hills (Molinete, Monte Sacro, Monte de San Jos√©, Despe√±aperros and Monte de la Concepci√≥n) following the example of Rome.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ciudadportuaria.com/2016/11/cartagena-ciudad-de-las-cinco-colinas.html |title=Ciudad Portuaria: Cartagena, ciudad de las cinco colinas. Parte I |date=16 November 2016 |language=es |access-date=1 February 2020 |archive-date=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201094423/http://www.ciudadportuaria.com/2016/11/cartagena-ciudad-de-las-cinco-colinas.html |url-status=live}}</ref> In the past, there was an inner sea between the hills called the Estero that eventually dried up. On this site, the "Ensanche" (Expansion or New Town) was built at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7" />

The urban area is delimited or crossed by several watercourses, some of which go deep into the urban network during a large part of their courses.<ref name=":7" />

===Climate===
Cartagena has a transitional climate between the [[hot semi-arid climate]] and the [[desert climate|hot desert climate]], tending more towards the latter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/conocermas/recursos_en_linea/publicaciones_y_estudios/publicaciones/NT_37_AEMET/NT_37_AEMET.pdf |title=Evolucion de los climas de Koppen en Espa√±a 1951-2020|website=aemet.es |access-date=23 August 2024 | language=es}}</ref> Its location near the sea moderates the temperature, and annual precipitation typically does not surpass {{cvt|300|mm|0}}. Cartagena has never recorded any temperature below freezing (below {{cvt|0|C|F}}) since records began.
The annual average temperature goes up to around {{cvt|19.2|¬∞C|0}}. The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of {{cvt|12.7|¬∞C|0}}. In August, the warmest month, the average temperature is {{cvt|27.0|¬∞C|0}}. The wind is an important climatic factor in the region.

[[File:Tetraclinis articulata cartagena.jpg|thumb|''[[Tetraclinis articulata]]'']]
Cartagena's coastal mountains have one of the highest levels of botanical biodiversity on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. A number of surprising Ibero-African species, which are found only in southern Spain (mostly in the provinces of [[Murcia]] and [[Almer√≠a]]) and North Africa. Among these, there stands out ''[[Tetraclinis articulata]]'' or ''Sandarac'' (''sabina mora'' or ''cipr√©s de Cartagena'' ‚ÄîCartagena cypress in Spanish) native to [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Malta]], and Cartagena, growing at relatively low altitudes in a hot, dry Mediterranean woodland. Some species are seriously endangered like the ''siempreviva de Cartagena'' ([[Limonium]] carthaginense), the ''rabogato del Mar Menor'' ([[Sideritis]] marmironensis), the ''zamarrilla de Cartagena'' ([[Teucrium]] carthaginense), the ''manzanilla de Escombreras'' ([[Anthemis chrysantha]]), the ''garbancillo de Tallante'' ([[Astragalus nitidiflorus]]), the ''jara de Cartagena'' ([[Cistus heterophyllus]] carthaginensis)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://urbanismo.cartagena.es/medionatural/areas.asp?CodMenu=20000&Ficha=20205&Activa=3 |title='''El Medio Natural en Cartagena''' - EL MEDIO NATURAL |language=es |access-date=5 September 2019 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727075859/https://urbanismo.cartagena.es/medionatural/areas.asp?CodMenu=20000&Ficha=20205&Activa=3 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archivo.asociacionanse.org/araar/herbario.htm |title=Flora de la Comarca de Cartagena en peligro |language=es |access-date=5 September 2019 |archive-date=17 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617211841/https://archivo.asociacionanse.org/araar/herbario.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> and the ''varica de San Jos√©'' ([[Narcissus tortifolius]]).

Neolithic components such as ceramic shards have been found.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Historia de Cartagena para principiantes |pages=40}}</ref>

The southeast of Cartagena was again inhabited during the [[Neolithic]]. The sites are ''Las Amoladeras'' and ''Calblanque''. The south of the Alumbres district was also inhabited during that period. The archaeological site is located in the ''Cerro del Gorguel'' (hill) and in it remains of a characteristic Neolithic hamlet were discovered.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite book |title=Historia de Cartagena para principiantes |pages=41}}</ref>

The reasons for the dearth of human presence and structures in this municipality during the Neolithic period were the lack of rainfall and the absence of water courses.

===Ancient history===
[[File:Cartagena muralla punica.jpg|thumb|right|Carthaginian walls of Carthago Nova (3rd century BC)]]

The town was originally named [[Mastia]]. Possessing one of the best harbors in the Western Mediterranean, it was re-founded by the Carthaginian general [[Hasdrubal the Fair|Hasdrubal]] in 228 BC as ''Qart Hadasht'' ("New City"), a name identical to [[Carthage]], for the purpose of serving as a stepping-off point for the conquest of Spain.

The Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]] [[Battle of Cartagena (209 BC)|conquered it in 209 BC]] and renamed it as ''Carthago Nova'' (literally "New ''New City''") to distinguish it from the mother city. It became a tributary community (''[[civitas stipendaria]]'').<ref>{{Cite book |page=32 |chapter=Cartagena y su t√©rmino de la Edad Media al siglo XIX |first=√Ångel Luis |last=Molina Molina |title=Estudios sobre Desarrollo Regional |year=2008 |isbn=978-84-8371-794-3<!-- |pages=25‚Äì60--> |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/2754227.pdf |access-date=23 July 2021 |archive-date=23 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210723185248/https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/2754227.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Julius Caesar]] gave the town [[Latin Rights]], and [[Octavian]] renamed it in his honor as the colony ''Colonia Victrix Iulia Nova Carthago'' or ''Colonia Vrbs Iulia Nova Carthago'' (C.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;C.) depending on the source. The city was very relevant both in the Carthaginian and the Roman conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In 298 AD, [[Diocletian]] constituted a new Roman province in Hispania called [[Carthaginensis]] and settled the capital in this city. It remained important until it was sacked by the [[Vandals]] in 435 AD.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7509-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |title=Historia de Cartagena- Antig√ºedad - Regi√≥n de Murcia Digital |language=es |access-date=1 February 2020 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727080712/http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7509-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cartagena.es/plantillas/10.asp?pt_idpag=888 |title=Historia de la Ciudad I Historia I Tu Ciudad I Ayuntamiento de Cartagena |language=es |access-date=1 February 2020 |archive-date=18 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118161948/https://www.cartagena.es/plantillas/10.asp?pt_idpag=888 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the Roman period, it was the site of major silver mines, yielding a daily revenue of 25,000 [[Ancient drachma|drachmae]]. It was known also for the production of [[garum]], a fermented fish sauce, and for [[esparto grass]]<ref>Hammond, N.G.L. & Scullard, H.H. (Eds.) (1970).'' The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', p. 209.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Lucerna bizantina.jpg|thumb|Byzantine lamp (6th century)]]
The demise and fall of [[Roman Empire|Western Roman]] sovereignty caused Cartago Spartaria to go into decline. It was occupied successively by the [[Vandals]] (409‚Äì425), the [[Visigoths]] (425‚Äì551 and 624‚Äì714) and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Romans]] (551‚Äì624), who made it the capital of [[Spania]] (the Byzantine Empire's westernmost province).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7509-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |title=Historia de Cartagena- Antig√ºedad - Regi√≥n de Murcia Digital |website=www.regmurcia.com |access-date=1 February 2020 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727080712/http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7509-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |url-status=live}}</ref>

Cartagena was re-conquered by the Visigoths, who held it until the Muslim conquest in 714 AD. By that time it was barely a fishing village.{{Sfn|Molina Molina|2008|p=35}} It was called Qartayannat-al-Halfa. It was subsequently ruled by the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] (714‚Äì756), the [[Caliphate of C√≥rdoba|Caliphate of Cordova]] (756‚Äì1031), the [[Taifa of Denia]] (1031‚Äì1076), the [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Taifa of Saragossa]] (1076‚Äì1081), the [[Taifa of Tortosa]] (1081‚Äì1092), the [[Almoravids]] (1092‚Äì1145), the [[Almohads]] (1145‚Äì1229) and the [[Taifa of Murcia]] (1229‚Äì1245).

Following the local refusal to abide to the 1243 Treaty of Alcazaz, a Castilian army led by the [[Alfonso the Wise|infante Alfonso of Castile]] took Cartagena by force in 1245 by means of a military operation combining land forces and a Cantabrian fleet.{{Sfn|Molina Molina|2008|p=37}} It was granted a ''[[fuero]]'' copied after C√≥rdoba's in 1246.<ref>{{Cite journal<!--|pages=251‚Äì260-->|page=256|title=Cartagena en el marco de la conquista del "Sarq Al-Andalus"|first=Antonio Vicente|last=Frey S√°nchez|journal=Mastia: Revista del Museo Arqueol√≥gico Municipal de Cartagena|issn=1579-3303|issue=2|year=2003|url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/6076285.pdf}}</ref> Similarly to the other subdued rebel towns, it early underwent an aggressive process of Castilianization.{{Sfn|Frey S√°nchez|2003|pp=255‚Äì256}} The [[Bishopric of Cartagena]] was created. In 1270, Alfonso created the [[Order of Santa Mar√≠a de Espa√±a]] for the naval defense of the [[Crown of Castile]] and established its headquarters in Cartagena. In 1296, Cartagena was briefly annexed to the [[Crown of Aragon]], but returned to Castile by the Treaty of Elx in 1305, which fixed the final boundary between the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. Cartagena then lost its status as royal demesne and became a seigneurial jurisdiction, a situation which lasted until 1346.{{Sfn|Molina Molina|2008|p=38}} Cartagena did not fully recover until the 18th century, when it became a leading naval port in the Mediterranean.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7513-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |title=Historia de Cartagena - Edad Media Cristiana - Regi√≥n de Murcia Digital |language=es |access-date=15 September 2018 |archive-date=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707035633/http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7513-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1728, Cartagena became the capital of the [[Structure of the Spanish Navy in the 21st century|Spanish Navy's Maritime Department of the Mediterranean]] and the city was heavily fortified with the construction of a modern castle in the place of a former Moorish [[Alcazaba|Kasbah]], several barracks and a huge [[Cartagena_Naval_Base#History|Cartagena Arsenal]].

It held out against the forces of General [[Francisco Franco]] longer than any other city in Spain, being the last of its cities to surrender.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7517-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |title=Historia de Cartagena- Siglo XX - Regi√≥n de Murcia Digital |language=es |access-date=1 February 2020 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727080817/https://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=a,75,c,373,m,1871&r=ReP-7517-DETALLE_REPORTAJESPADRE |url-status=live}}</ref> The city saw its industrial activity increase during the 1950s, resulting in greater prosperity and this trend continued until a general decline in manufacturing throughout Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

[[File:AytoCartagena.jpg|thumb|Cartagena's City Hall]]

Thanks to its strategic position on the Mediterranean, Cartagena has been inhabited by many different cultures, which have left their mark on its rich cultural heritage during a glorious and turbulent history.<ref name=":9" />

The "Cartagena, Port of Cultures" initiative was created to allow visitors to enjoy a wide range of activities and visits, discovering the cultural wealth and rich history of the city. It is one of several projects to energize the tourist possibilities of this potential major cultural destination,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cartagenapuertodeculturas.com/ |title=Cartagena Puerto de Culturas |language=es |access-date=16 September 2018 |archive-date=23 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823200135/https://www.cartagenapuertodeculturas.com/ |url-status=live}}</ref> frequently neglected by the mass-tourism, due to the proximity of several holiday resorts, and the refinery and other industrial development, which gave a bad reputation to the city because of pollution; these last have now fortunately been eradicated.

===Archaeological sites===
[[File:CT teatro romano y catedral.jpg|thumb|left|The Roman Theatre of Carthago Nova and Cathedral ruins of Cartagena]]

Although there are some ruins from the Carthaginian period, like the remains of the [[Punic wall of Cartagena|Punic rampart]] (built in 227 BC with the foundation of the city), most of its oldest monuments date from the time of the [[Roman Empire]] when Cartagena flourished.
The archaeologist [[Blanca Rold√°n]] studied this Punic Rampart and other Punic remains, especially on the [[Molinete Hill]]. Among its numerous Roman remains, the recently restored [[Roman theatre, Cartagena|Roman theatre of Carthago Nova]] is prominent and is one of the city's landmarks. Work on it started at the end of the 2nd century BC. The Roman Theatre Museum was recently officially inaugurated. In Roman Republican Times, the mines near Cartagena provided silver and lead for all the Roman Empire.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=https://turismo.cartagena.es/itinerario_arqueologico.asp |title=Concejal√≠a de Turismo - Ayuntamiento de Cartagena |language=es |access-date=14 September 2018 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727154052/https://turismo.cartagena.es/itinerario_arqueologico.asp |url-status=live}}</ref>

Other Roman remains can be found in several buildings and interpretative centres, including the Roman Colonnade, the House of Fortune, the ''decumanus/cardo'' and the ''[[Augusteum]]''.
The ''[[Torre Ciega]]'' was built by the Romans for burials; it formed part of the Necropolis.<ref name=":3" />

The Roman Amphitheatre (1st century AD) was sited where the now-abandoned Bullring was built, but only some of the surrounding walls and part of the rooms under the stands are still visible. Recent work is revealing more evidence.

Besides the Roman heritage, archaeological sights include the remains of the [[Santa Mar√≠a la Vieja Cathedral]], which was irreversibly destroyed during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. It dates from the end of the 13th century. The decorated floor of a Roman house of the 1st century BC can be found in the crypt.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=c,522,m,162&r=CeAP-3987-R_122_DETALLE_REPORTAJES |title=Catedral Antigua de Santa Mar√≠a - Historia - Regi√≥n de Murcia Digital |language=es |access-date=14 September 2018 |archive-date=14 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914165702/http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=c,522,m,162&r=CeAP-3987-R_122_DETALLE_REPORTAJES |url-status=live}}</ref>

A Byzantine rampart can be found, close to the Roman Theatre and the Cathedral.<ref name=":3" />

The Concepci√≥n Castle (now Centre for the Interpretation of the History of Cartagena) was reconstructed in the 13th century using large structures from the Amphitheatre. Apart from the Roman Theatre Museum, there are also two important archaeological museums: the Municipal Archaeological Museum and the recently opened Arqua (National Museum of Maritime Archaeology).<ref name=":3" />

===Baroque and Neo-classical buildings===
[[File:Cartagena muralla CarlosIII.JPG|thumb|Original Charles III rampart]]

The ''Campus Muralla del Mar'', an old military hospital, was one of the first works carried out after the transformation of the city into the main Spanish naval base in the Mediterranean, and is now the seat of the Polytechnic University. In the vicinity, there is the Autopsy Theatre, which is where anatomy classes used to be given. Rehabilitation for tourism provides for the interpretation of the nearby buildings at the time of their construction.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |url=https://turismo.cartagena.es/itinerario_barroco.asp |title=Concejal√≠a de Turismo - Ayuntamiento de Cartagena |language=es |access-date=14 September 2018 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727080218/https://turismo.cartagena.es/itinerario_barroco.asp |url-status=live}}</ref>

These buildings and several other baroque or neo-classical buildings demonstrate the military importance of Cartagena. These include the Charles III Rampart, the [[Castillo de San Juli√°n]], the Arsenal, the Midshipmen's Barracks (academy and naval barracks), the Naval Headquarter Palace (built in 1740 and subsequently rebuilt) and the Artillery Headquarters, which also houses the [[Historical Military Museum of Cartagena (Spain)|Military Museum]].
Among the Baroque or Neo-classical Churches in Cartagena are ''El Carmen'', ''Santo Domingo'' and ''Santa Maria de Gracia''.<ref name=":4" />

===Modernist and Eclectic buildings===
[[File:Gran Hotel2.JPG|thumb|left|The Gran Hotel]]

Cartagena is home to numerous [[Art Nouveau]] buildings from the early 20th century, when a bourgeoisie settled in the city due to the growth of the local mining industry. These buildings include the City Hall, the Grand Hotel, the Casino (all of them among the city's landmarks).

The Railway Station has some outstanding iron doors and columns on its facade, and inside can still be seen the original ticket office, door frame, ceiling, and lamps. Other modernist or eclectic houses include the Clares House, the Aguirre Palace (which houses the Regional Museum of Modern Art, or MURAM), the Cervantes House (relatively big in comparison with other modernist buildings), the Llagostera House, the Pedre√±o Palace, the Dorda House, the Zapata House and the Urban Expansion Company House.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://turismo.cartagena.es/itinerario_modernista.asp |title=Itinerario Modernista y Ecl√©ctico |work=Concejal√≠a de Turismo |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Cartagena |language=es |access-date=14 September 2018 |archive-date=31 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831174954/https://turismo.cartagena.es/itinerario_modernista.asp |url-status=live}}</ref>

Several charming, lively streets cover this area, such as Calle Mayor (High Street), the major pedestrian and commercial street of the city, full of boutiques and bars with typical "tapas", Carmen Street, Puertas de Murcia Street and many more.

The Caridad church is one of the most important churches in the city, since it is dedicated to the patron of Cartagena, Nuestra Se√±ora de Caridad. The interior is dominated by a dome, similar to the Pantheon of Agrippa, in Rome. There are also several outstanding sculptures by the famous Murcian sculptor [[Francisco Salzillo]] and his school.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=,c,522,m,162&r=CeAP-671-PORTADA_CENTRO_AMPLIADO |title=Bas√≠lica de la Caridad |work=Regi√≥n de Murcia Digital |language=es |access-date=14 September 2018 |publisher=Fundaci√≥n Integra |archive-date=14 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914165607/http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=,c,522,m,162&r=CeAP-671-PORTADA_CENTRO_AMPLIADO |url-status=live}}</ref>
