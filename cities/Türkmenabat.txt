'''Türkmenabat''' ({{lang-tk|Türkmenabat, Түркменабат}}), formerly '''Amul''', '''Cärjew/Chardzhou''' (until 1924 and from 1940-1999), and '''Novy Chardzhuy''' (from 1927-1940), is the second-largest city in [[Turkmenistan]] and the [[administrative centre]] of [[Lebap Province]]. {{As of|2009}}, it had a population of approximately 254,000 people (up from 161,000 in the 1989 census).{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  From 1924 to 1927, it was also named '''Leninsk''' in honor of [[Vladimir Lenin]].<ref name=bse />

== Etymology ==
The former name of the city, Çärjew (also Chardzhou), is a Turkmen borrowing from the Persian ''čahârjuy'', which consists of two parts: ''čahâr'', meaning "four", and ''juy'', meaning "brook". This type of naming is also common in Iran, such as the village [[Seh Juy|Se Juy]] (literally 'three brooks'). The current name of the city is simply a combining of ''[[Turkmens|Türkmen]]'' and the Persian suffix ''[[-abad|ābād (آباد)]]'', meaning "cultivated place" (village, city, region).

==Geography==
Türkmenabat is located at an altitude of {{cvt|187|m|ft}} on the banks of the [[Amu Darya]] River, near the border with [[Uzbekistan]]. Türkmenabat is at the center of Lebap province, which has borders with three provinces in Turkmenistan: [[Mary Province|Mary]], [[Ahal Province|Ahal]] and [[Daşoguz Province|Daşoguz]]. The province also borders Uzbekistan and [[Afghanistan]].

Some {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=off}} south of Türkmenabat in the East [[Karakum Desert]] is the [[Repetek Nature Reserve]], famed for its ''zemzen'', or desert crocodiles.

==History==
A modern industrial city, Türkmenabat's history spans 2,000 years.  In ancient times, it was known as Āmul (to be distinguished from the Iranian city of [[Amol]]). The river [[Amu Darya]] is said to mean ''River of Āmul'', named after this ancient city. Türkmenabat was the hub in an intersection of three routes of the Great [[Silk Road]] leading to [[Bukhara]], [[Khiva]] and [[Merv]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. For centuries, Āmul was an important town of the Uzbek feudal [[khanate]] (later [[emirate]]) of Bukhara.

When the Russian Empire began annexing Central Asian [[Turkestan]], Āmul was surrendered to Russians by the Bukhara [[emirate]], which subsequently became a [[vassal]] of Russia and pledged allegiance to the Russian emperor. The modern city was founded in 1886, when Russian [[Cossacks]] settled in Uralka in what is now the eastern part of Türkmenabat, naming their settlement ''New-Chardjuy''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Settlement here was necessary to complete construction of the [[Trans-Caspian railway]].

After the [[Russian Revolution|revolution of 1917]], during which the [[Bolsheviks]] came into power in Russia, communists merged the former Central Asian oblasts of the Russian Empire along with the former Khanates of Khiva (Khorezm) and Bukhara into republics on the basis of nationality. In 1924, Türkmenabat (known as ''Chardjuy'' at that time) city's sedentary and urban population was [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]]. But at the time, as [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]] were a largely nomadic nation, and Soviet economic and industrialization plans for the proposed Turkmen SSR required a relatively large anchor city; thus the city was passed to the newly created [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]].<ref>Khalid, Adeeb. ''Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR''. 1st ed., Cornell University Press, 2016. JSTOR, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt20fw5rf]. Accessed 11 Aug. 2024.</ref>

[[File:1. Чарджуй (бухарские владения). У городских ворот.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Photo taken at the entrance to the old {{lang|tk|Çärjew}} (Turkmenabat), by the French photographer Paul Nadar in 1890]]

Its role as a [[railway junction]], and the high fertility of the Amu Darya region, made it the major trade center for agricultural products in the northeast region of the country.  The city features [[food processing]], [[textile]] ([[cotton]] processing and [[silk]]) factories. Çärjew was Turkmenistan's industrial and transport hub during the Soviet period, but most of these related jobs and transport opportunities have been relocated to [[Ashgabat]] or closed since Turkmenistan's independence.

From the article about Chardjuy in the ''Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary'' (beginning of the 20th century):
<blockquote>Chardjuy is an urban settlement formed near the Amu-Darya station (1070 c. from Krasnovodsk) of the Central Asian Railway, on the left bank of the Amu-Darya River, on land ceded by the emir of Bukhara to the Russian government. There are 4 068 inhabitants (2 651 men, 1 417 women), including 3 501 Russians. There are wide straight streets, enough greenery, many shops, and a rather lively bazaar. Chardjuy is an important trade center, where goods going to Bukhara, Khiva, and partly to Afghanistan, are loaded onto river vessels. The steamboat of the Amu Darya fleet maintains communication between Patta Gissar (Termez) in the south and Petro-Aleksandrovsky (Khiva)... At 16 verst from Chardjuy lies the rather large Bukharan city of Chardjuy (native Chardjuy), the center of Chardjuy province (bekstvo), with the remains of walls and a fortress; 15 thousand inhabitants. Old Chardjuy (Amu-Darya) is characterized by a lively trade exchange. In 1900, 1820244 pd arrived at the station. (military supplies, sugar, timber, building material, iron, flour, tea, rice, etc.); Sent from the Chardjuy station in the same year: 963382 (leather, carpets, sheepskin, cotton seed, cotton - 516641 pd, wool, etc.).</blockquote>

The third edition of the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] wrote of the city:<blockquote>Chardzhou, city, center of Chardzhou oblast of Turkmen SSR, pier on the left bank of the Amu Darya (where the Krasnovodsk-Tashkent railroad line crosses). From Chardzhou the Kungrad-Makat rail line begins. 113,000 residents in 1977 (51,000 in 1939). It arose in the 1880s as a Russian fortification on the territory of the Khanate of Bukhara. From 1886 the city, named New Chardzou, was a commercial and transportation hub of Central  Asia (in 1888 the Central Asian Railway came through Chardzhou). From 1918-24 it was part of the Turkestan ASSR; from 1924, the Turkmen SSR. From 1937, it was named Chardzhou. From 1939-63 and since 1970, it was an oblast center.<ref name=bse>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://bse.slovaronline.com/51913-CHARDZHOU |article=ЧАРДЖОУ|title=Большая советская энциклопедия|edition=3|language=Russian}} (online version)</ref></blockquote>
