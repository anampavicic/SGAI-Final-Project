==History==
{{Main|History of Aberdeen}}

===Early origins===

The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years.<ref name="prehistory" /> The city began as two separate [[burgh]]s: [[Old Aberdeen]] at the mouth of the [[River Don, Aberdeenshire|river Don]]; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary.<ref>[https://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst498.html New Aberdeen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016111514/https://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst498.html |date=16 October 2019 }}, [[Gazetteer for Scotland]]</ref> The earliest [[charter]] was granted by [[William the Lion]] in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by [[David I of Scotland|David I]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfAHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA8|title=Annals of Aberdeen, from the reign of King William the Lion|volume=1|page=8|first=William|last=Kennedy|year=1818|publisher=A.

In 1214, Aberdeen Burgesses were granted a Royal Charter by [[Alexander II of Scotland]] giving them the sole right to form a Guild. This body exercised power in the composition of the local council, and the affairs of the town. The [[Burgesses of Guild of Aberdeen|Burgesses of the Guild]] were an integral part of the council for more than 700 years and played a considerable role in the growth and development of Aberdeen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Us {{!}} Aberdeen Burgesses |url=http://www.aberdeenburgesses.com/about-us/ |access-date=21 December 2023}}</ref> In 1319, the Great Charter of [[Robert the Bruce]] transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===
{{main|Wars of Scottish Independence}}

During the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Aberdeen was under English rule, so Robert the Bruce laid siege to [[Aberdeen Castle]] before destroying it in 1308, followed by executing the English garrison. The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSRAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA9-IA1|title=Notes on the Chapel, Crown, and Other Ancient Buildings of King's College, Aberdeen|first=Norman|last=Macpherson|year=1889|page=9|publisher=Neill and Company|access-date=18 March 2023|archive-date=15 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415010001/https://books.google.com/books?id=NSRAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA9-IA1|url-status=live}}</ref>

Aberdeen's medieval council registers survive from 1398 onwards and are exceptional for their quantity and continuity among surviving Scottish burgh records. The earliest eight volumes, from 1398 to 1511, have been included in the UNESCO [[UK Memory of the World Register]], and have been edited in a digital edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/datasets/aberdeen-registers-online-1398-1511|title=Aberdeen Registers Online: 1398–1511|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=2019|publisher=University of Aberdeen|access-date=15 August 2021|archive-date=7 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210807164139/https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/datasets/aberdeen-registers-online-1398-1511|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of 1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Battle of Aberdeen]]<ref>{{Cite book|first=Chris |last=Brown |title=The Battle of Aberdeen 1644|year=2002|publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire}}</ref> and two years later [[Battle of Aberdeen (1646)|it was stormed]] by a Royalist force under the command of the [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly]].<ref>{{Cite DNB|last=Henderson |first=Thomas Finlayson |wstitle=Gordon, George (d.1649)  |volume=22 |pages=190–194}}</ref> An outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] over 1687 and 1688 killed 8.5% of the population, adding to the economic and demographic damage caused by war.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jillings |first1=K. |title=Aberdeen's Plague Epidemic of 1647–48 |journal=Scottish Medical Journal |date=1 August 2010 |volume=3 |issue=55 |pages=43–45 |doi=10.1258/rsmsmj.55.3.43 |pmid=20795518 |s2cid=24546213 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1258/rsmsmj.55.3.43?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed |access-date=31 August 2023 |archive-date=31 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230831161044/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1258/rsmsmj.55.3.43?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed |url-status=live }}</ref> In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary|Aberdeen Infirmary]] at [[Woolmanhill Hospital|Woolmanhill]] in 1739<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1452|title=Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Aberdeen|publisher=National Archives|access-date=23 December 2018|archive-date=23 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223164155/https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1452|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Royal Cornhill Hospital|Aberdeen Lunatic Asylum]] in 1800.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://calms.abdn.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqServer=Calms&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27grhb%202%27%29 |title=Collection: GB 1105: NHS Grampian Archives |publisher=Aberdeen University |website=calms.abdn.ac.uk |access-date=15 December 2016 |archive-date=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503142052/http://calms.abdn.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqServer=Calms&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27grhb%202%27%29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Post-Napoleonic depression===

The expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817 during the [[Post-Napoleonic depression]], an economic downturn immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; but the city's prosperity later recovered. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the [[Aberdeen Harbour|present harbour]] including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier.

Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a [[reservoir]] in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.<ref name="fraser"/> The city absorbed the neighbouring burghs of Old Aberdeen and [[Woodside, Aberdeen|Woodside]] plus the [[Torry]] area on the south bank of the Dee in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2020-10/Aberdeen%20History%20Trail.pdf|title=Aberdeen History Trail|page=3|access-date=28 July 2022|archive-date=28 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220728193400/https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2020-10/Aberdeen%20History%20Trail.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=1891act>{{cite web |title=Aberdeen Corporation Act 1891 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/54-55/124/pdfs/ukla_18910124_en.pdf |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=10 August 2024}}</ref>

===Second World War===

Over the course of [[World War II]] Aberdeen was attacked 32 times by the German [[Luftwaffe]]. One of the most devastating attacks was on Wednesday 21 April 1943 when 29 Luftwaffe [[Dornier Do 217|Dornier 217s]] flying from [[Stavanger]], Norway attacked the city between the hours of 22:17 and 23:04.<ref>[http://www.mcjazz.f2s.com/Blitzkreig.htm "The Aberdeen Mittwoch Blitz – Wednesday 21st April 1943"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105231049/http://www.mcjazz.f2s.com/Blitzkreig.htm |date=5 January 2013 }}, ''The Doric Columns'', Retrieved 13 September 2019.</ref> A total of 98 civilians and 27 servicemen were killed, along with 12,000 houses damaged, after a mixture of 127 Incendiary, High Explosive and Cluster bombs were dropped on the city in one night.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/past-times/4170473/blitz-aberdeen/|title=The Aberdeen Blitz of 1943 left the City in ruins and death all around|newspaper=Press and Journal|date=20 April 2022|access-date=8 October 2022|archive-date=7 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707123341/https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/past-times/4170473/blitz-aberdeen/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Two books written in 2018 and 2022 using bombing records held in London identified that unexploded bombs from the 1943 raid were found in the 1950s and 1980s making the bombs dropped 129 in total. Damage from the raid can still be seen in some parts of Aberdeen.

The first element of the name is the [[Pictish language|Pictish]] word {{Lang|xpi|aber}} 'river mouth'. The second element is from the Celtic river goddess [[Divona|Devona]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Grant|first=Alison|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/759569647|title=The Pocket Guide to Scottish Place-Names|date=2010|publisher=Richard Drew Ltd|isbn=978-1-899471-00-3|editor-last=Macleod|editor-first=Iseabail|location=Glasgow|pages=23|oclc=759569647|access-date=8 February 2021|archive-date=15 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200815070952/http://worldcat.org/oclc/759569647|url-status=live}}</ref>

Aberdeen is usually described as within the historical [[Picts|Pictish]] territory and became Gaelic-speaking at some time in the medieval period. Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of Aberdon, the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means "the mouth of the Don". The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word {{lang|cel|aber}} means "river mouth", as in modern Welsh ([[Aberystwyth]], [[Aberdare]], [[Aberbeeg]] etc.).<ref name="Charnock">{{Cite book |first=Richard Stephen |last=Charnock |title=Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names |year=1859 |publisher=Houlston and Wright }}</ref> The [[Scottish Gaelic]] name is {{lang|gd|Obar Dheathain}} (variation: {{lang|gd|Obairreadhain}}; {{lang|gd|*obar}} presumably being a loan from the earlier Pictish; the Gaelic term is {{lang|gd|inbhir}}), and in [[Latin]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] referred to the river as {{lang|la|Devana}}.

==Governance and heraldry==

===Local government===
[[File:Aberdeen 03.jpg|thumb|[[Marischal College]], Broad Street: main offices of Aberdeen City Council]]
Aberdeen City is one of 32 [[council areas of Scotland]], administered by [[Aberdeen City Council]]. The council meets at [[Aberdeen Town House]] and has its main offices in the adjoining [[Marischal College]]. The civic head and chair of the council is the [[Lord Provost of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]].

The council area is also divided into 30 [[List of community council areas in Scotland#Aberdeen City|community council areas]], 29 of which had community councils operating as at August 2024.<ref>{{cite web |title=Community Councils |url=https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy/community-councils/community-councils |website=Aberdeen City Council |date=8 February 2024 |access-date=14 August 2024}}</ref>

===Administrative history===
The first [[burgh]] of Aberdeen, covering just the New Aberdeen area near the mouth of the Dee, was created by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (reigned 1124–1153).<ref name="civicsociety"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Aberdeen Burgh |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10357603#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=14 August 2024}}</ref> Neighbouring Old Aberdeen to the north was subsequently made a separate burgh in 1489.<ref>{{cite web |title=Old Aberdeen Burgh |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10361400 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=14 August 2024}}</ref>

The burgh of Aberdeen was governed by a corporation, also known as the town council. As Aberdeen grew, the council's powers were inadequate to cater for the needs of the growing urban area. A separate [[Police burgh|police commission]] was established in 1795 with powers to levy taxes and provide infrastructure ('police' in this context being its older meaning of civic government rather than law enforcement). The first police commission was short-lived, but it was resurrected in 1818 after the town council went bankrupt in 1817. From 1818 until 1871 there was a dual system of local government, with the town council and police commission having different roles in Aberdeen's administration. The police commission was eventually abolished in 1871 and its functions absorbed by the town council.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Clive Howard |title=Aberdeen, 1800–2000 |date=2000 |publisher=Tuckwell Press |isbn=9781862321083 |pages=236–252 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6az73FqFVMMC&pg=PA236 |access-date=14 August 2024}}</ref>

In 1891 the city boundaries were significantly enlarged, absorbing the neighbouring burghs of Old Aberdeen and Woodside, plus the Torry area on the south bank of the Dee. The act of parliament which expanded the burgh also confirmed that Aberdeen was entitled to be called a city; it had commonly been described as a city prior to that, but (like most Scottish cities) without official recognition.<ref name=1891act/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Beckett |first1=J.

Following the absorption of Torry in 1891, the city boundaries straddled the counties of [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] and [[Kincardineshire]]. Aberdeen was made a [[county of city|county of itself]] in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aberdeen Corporation Act 1899 (c. 60) |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/62-63/60/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=5 February 2023}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=11136|page=958|date=13 October 1899|city=e}}</ref> In 1975 the burgh was replaced by the larger City of Aberdeen district within the [[Grampian]] region.<ref name=1973act>{{cite web |title=Quarter-inch Administrative Areas Maps: Scotland Sheet 5, 1969 |url=https://maps.nls.uk/view/222075470 |website=National Library of Scotland |publisher=Ordnance Survey |access-date=15 August 2024}}</ref> Further local government reforms in 1996 replaced the districts and regions created in 1975 with council areas; the pre-1996 City of Aberdeen district became the Aberdeen City council area.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994|year=1994|chapter=39|accessdate=29 January 2023}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|city=e|issue=23789|page=1332|date=26 May 1995}}</ref>

===Westminster and Holyrood===
Aberdeen is represented in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by two [[Constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|constituencies]], [[Aberdeen North (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen North]] and [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]], which are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2023_review_final/bcs_2023_review_report_web_version.pdf |title=2023 Review of UK Parliament Constituency Boundaries in Scotland |date=27 June 2023 |website=[[Boundary Commission for Scotland]]}}</ref>

In the [[Scottish Parliament]], the city is represented by three constituencies with different boundaries: [[Aberdeen Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen Central]] and [[Aberdeen Donside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen Donside]] are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area. [[Aberdeen South and North Kincardine (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South and North Kincardine]] includes the North [[Kincardine, Aberdeenshire|Kincardine]] ward of [[Aberdeenshire Council]]. A further seven MSPs are elected as part of the [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|North East Scotland]] electoral region. In the [[European Parliament]] the city was represented by six [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] as part of the all-inclusive Scotland constituency.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irIYBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA254|title=Scotland and Europe, Scotland in Europe|year=2009|page=254|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1443807043|access-date=18 March 2023|archive-date=14 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414205525/https://books.google.com/books?id=irIYBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA254|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Coat of arms and motto===
The arms and banner of the city show three silver towers on red. This motif dates from at least the time of [[Robert the Bruce]] and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of medieval Aberdeen: Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's [[Castlegate, Aberdeen|Castlegate]]); the city gate on Port Hill; and a church on St&nbsp;Catherine's Hill (now levelled).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html|title=Aberdeen City|access-date=15 May 2007|author=Gazetteer for Scotland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613171026/http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html|archive-date=13 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

"Bon Accord" is the [[motto]] of the city and is French for "Good Agreement". Legend tells that its use dates from a password used by Robert the Bruce during the 14th century [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], when he and his men laid siege to the English-held Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308.<ref name="keith" /> It is still widely present in the city, throughout street names, business names and the city's [[Bon Accord Centre|Bon Accord]] shopping mall.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bon Accord & St Nicholas|url = http://bonaccordandstnicholas.com/|publisher = bonaccordandstnicholas.com|access-date = 17 October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081026083320/http://www.bonaccordandstnicholas.com/|archive-date = 26 October 2008|url-status = dead}}</ref>

The shield in the coat of arms is [[supporters (heraldry)|supported]] by two [[leopard]]s. A local magazine is called the "Leopard" and, when Union Bridge was widened in the 20th century, small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts (known locally as Kelly's Cats). The city's toast is "Happy to meet, sorry to part, happy to meet again".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/introducing.html|title=Aberdeen Official Guide|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|access-date=17 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218082352/http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/introducing.html|archive-date=18 February 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Location and area===
Being situated between two river mouths, the city has little natural exposure of bedrock. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of Devonian "Old Red" sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the [[Dalradian]] period (approximately 480–600&nbsp;million years ago) with sporadic areas of [[igneous rock|igneous]] [[Diorite]] granites to be found, such as that at the [[Rubislaw quarry]] which was used to build much of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |title=Details of Aberdeen City |author=Gazetteer for Scotland |access-date=10 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124035411/http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |archive-date=24 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city extends to {{convert|{{UK subdivision area|GSS=S12000033}}|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name="popstats" /> and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, [[Woodside, Aberdeen|Woodside]] and the [[Torry]] area to the south of [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]].

===Climate===
[[File:3rd Aug 2012- Abdn Harbour 2.JPG|thumb|right|Sunshine across Aberdeen during August]] 
Aberdeen features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''), with far milder winter temperatures than one might expect for its northern location. However, statistically speaking, it is still the coldest city in the UK. During the winter, especially throughout December, the length of the day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 41 minutes between sunrise and sunset at the winter solstice.<ref name="Sunrise and sunset for Aberdeen">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com/en/sun/united-kingdom/aberdeen/2015|title=Sunrise and sunset for Aberdeen|publisher=Sunrise and Sunset|access-date=27 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027200423/http://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com/en/sun/united-kingdom/aberdeen/2015|archive-date=27 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 55 minutes between sunrise and sunset.<ref name="Sunrise and sunset for Aberdeen"/> During this time of the year marginal [[nautical twilight]] lasts the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year hover around {{convert|17.0|C|F}} during the day in most of the urban area, though nearer {{convert|16.0|C|F}} directly on the coast, and around {{convert|18.0|to|19.0|C|F}} in the westernmost suburbs.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = [[MetOffice]]| url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/escotland/7100_1km/MaxTemp_Average_1971-2000_7.gif| title = July temp map| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120305153715/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/escotland/7100_1km/MaxTemp_Average_1971-2000_7.gif| archive-date = 5 March 2012}}</ref>

Both are about {{convert|4+1/2|mi|km|0}} to the northwest of the city centre, and given that they are in close proximity to each other, exhibit very similar climatic regimes.

Christianity is the main religion practised in the city. Aberdeen's largest denominations are the [[Church of Scotland]] (through the [[Presbytery of Aberdeen]]) and the Roman [[Catholic Church]], both with numerous churches across the city, with the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] having the third-largest number. The census in 2022 showed that Aberdeen has the highest proportion of non-religious residents of any city in Scotland, with 58% of citizens claiming to have no religion.<ref name="Religion_Census2022">{{cite web |title=Council Area 2019 by Religion by Individuals |url=https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/search-the-census#/location/topics/list?topic=Ethnic%20group,%20national%20identity,%20language%20and%20religion&categoryId=1 |publisher=[[National Records of Scotland]] |access-date=24 May 2024}} Aberdeen City > Ethnic group, national identity, language and religion</ref>

In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen|Kirk of St&nbsp;Nicholas]] was the only burgh kirk and one of Scotland's largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], in this case into the East and West churches. At that time, the city also was home to houses of the [[Carmelites]] (Whitefriars)<ref name='IA'>{{cite journal |author1=Alison Cameron |author2=Judith A.

[[St Machar's Cathedral]] was built twenty years after [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (1124–1153) transferred the pre-Reformation [[diocese]] from Mortlach in [[Banffshire]] to Old Aberdeen in 1137. Except the episcopate of [[William Elphinstone]] (1484–1511), building progressed slowly. [[Gavin Dunbar (Bishop of Aberdeen)|Gavin Dunbar]], who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. It is now a congregation of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Aberdeen has two other cathedrals: [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Mary's Cathedral]] is a [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral in [[Gothic style]], erected in 1859. In addition, [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] serves the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. It was constructed in 1817 as [[Archibald Simpson]]'s first commission and contains a memorial to the consecration of the first bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], which took place nearby. In 1804, [[St Peter's Church, Aberdeen|St Peter's Church]], the first permanent Roman Catholic church in the city after the Reformation was built.<ref name=list>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-19973-st-peter-s-r-c-church-and-presbytery-and- St Peter's R.c.

Numerous other Protestant denominations have a presence in Aberdeen. [[The Salvation Army]] citadel on the Castlegate dominates the view of the east end of Union Street. In addition, there is a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church, established in 1833 and located in Skene Terrace. [[Christadelphians]] have been present in Aberdeen since at least 1844. Over the years, they have rented space to meet at a number of locations and currently meet in the Inchgarth Community Centre in Garthdee.<ref>'[http://ukchristadelphians.org.uk/info.asp?act=ecc&id=3 Aberdeen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012540/http://ukchristadelphians.org.uk/info.asp?act=ecc&id=3 |date=16 July 2011 }}' on ''Find your local Christadelphians''</ref> There is also a [[Quaker]] meetinghouse on Crown Street, the only purpose built [[Friends meeting house]] in Scotland that is still in use today. In addition, there are a number of Baptist congregations in the city, and [[Evangelical]] congregations have been appearing in significant numbers since the late 2000s. The city also has two meeting houses of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news-uk.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/new-church-leader-for-aberdeen-congregation|title=New Church Leader for Aberdeen Congregation|date=9 August 2015|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|access-date=8 October 2022|archive-date=8 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008145232/https://news-uk.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/new-church-leader-for-aberdeen-congregation|url-status=live}}</ref>

Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, shipbuilding and paper-making. These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the [[oil industry]], which have been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic growth, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |title=A burst of energy in Europe's oil capital |publisher=BBC News |date=12 November 2003 |access-date=18 February 2007 |archive-date=25 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125122938/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the 18th century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and paper-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the [[Paper mills of Aberdeen|Stoneywood Paper Mill]] with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when [[Richards of Aberdeen]] closed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4022695.stm| title=Jobs go at Aberdeen textile firm| date=18 November 2004| publisher=[[BBC News]]| access-date=9 October 2009| archive-date=13 August 2023| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230813070536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4022695.stm| url-status=live}}</ref>

Grey granite was [[quarry|quarried]] at [[Rubislaw quarry]] for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]] in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. The current owners have begun pumping 40 years of rainwater from the quarry to develop a heritage centre on the site.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|title=Water pumping work starts at Rubislaw Quarry in Aberdeen|publisher=BBC News|access-date=18 October 2012|date=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713191152/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|archive-date=13 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In-shore fishing was once the predominant industry but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th century. Catches have fallen because of overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels,<ref name="harbour">{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeen-harbour.co.uk/history.html|title=Aberdeen Harbour: A History of Service|publisher=Aberdeen Harbour Board|access-date=18 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403194640/http://www.aberdeen-harbour.co.uk/history.html|archive-date=3 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of [[Peterhead]] and [[Fraserburgh]].

Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at [[The James Hutton Institute]] (formerly the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute), which has close links to the city's two universities. The [[Rowett Research Institute]] is a world-renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen. It has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of [[life scientists]] working in the city.<ref name="rowett">{{cite web|url=http://www.rowett.ac.uk/institute/history.html|title=History and Background|publisher=Rowett Research Institute |access-date=1 February 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061229125832/http://www.rowett.ac.uk/institute/history.html| archive-date= 29 December 2006 }}</ref><ref name="newscientist">{{cite web|title=A Scientist's guide to Scotland |work=New Scientist |access-date=9 May 2013 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524852.500-a-scientists-guide-to-scotland.html |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202113753/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524852.500-a-scientists-guide-to-scotland.html }}</ref>

As oil reserves in the North Sea decrease, there is an effort to rebrand Aberdeen as "Energy Capital of Europe" rather than "Oil Capital of Europe", and there is interest in the development of new energy sources, and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is underway. The "Energetica" initiative led by Scottish Enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |title=A burst of energy in Europe's oil capital |publisher=BBC News |date=12 November 2003 |access-date=18 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727125146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |archive-date=27 July 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> Aberdeen has become a major world centre for undersea petroleum technology.<ref name=NYT72813>{{cite news|title=Aberdeen, a City With One Foot on the Seafloor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/business/global/aberdeen-a-city-with-one-foot-on-the-seafloor.html|access-date=29 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 July 2013|author=Stanley Reed|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803031015/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/business/global/aberdeen-a-city-with-one-foot-on-the-seafloor.html|archive-date=3 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/underwater-drones-set-to-save-aberdeen-s-oil-economy-d3xnz6d9b|title=Underwater drones set to save Aberdeen's oil economy|date=15 August 2016|newspaper=The Times|access-date=8 October 2022|archive-date=8 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008150333/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/underwater-drones-set-to-save-aberdeen-s-oil-economy-d3xnz6d9b|url-status=live}}</ref>

Aberdeen had been a major maritime centre throughout the 19th century, when a group of local entrepreneurs launched the first steam-powered trawler. The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to [[Peterhead]].<ref>[https://www.peterheadport.co.uk/about/history Port History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814080851/https://www.peterheadport.co.uk/about/history |date=14 August 2020 }} – PeterheadPort.co.uk</ref>

Geologists had speculated about oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, {{convert|110|mi}} east of Aberdeen.<ref name=":1" />

By late 1975, after years of intense construction, the necessary infrastructure was in place. Oil flowed through the [[Forties pipeline system]] directly to the refinery at far-away [[Grangemouth]].<ref>{{Cite press release | url=https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/bp-to-sell-forties-pipeline-system-to-ineos.html | title=BP to sell Forties Pipeline System to INEOS | publisher=[[BP]] | date=3 April 2017 | access-date=8 October 2022 | archive-date=8 October 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008151144/https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/bp-to-sell-forties-pipeline-system-to-ineos.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

Today, all railway services to the south run via {{rws|Dundee}}. The faster main line from Aberdeen to {{rws|Perth}} via {{rws|Forfar}} and {{rws|Strathmore}} closed in 1967, as a result of the [[Beeching cuts]]; the faster main line from Perth to Edinburgh via {{rws|Glenfarg}} also closed subsequently in 1970. 

A second station, at {{rws|Dyce}}, serves the north of the city centre; it is on the [[Aberdeen–Inverness line]].

===Roads===
There are six major roads in and out of the city:
* The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south, linking Aberdeen to Edinburgh (via the [[M90 motorway|M90]]), [[Dundee]], [[Brechin]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the south and [[Ellon, Aberdeenshire|Ellon]], [[Peterhead]] and [[Fraserburgh]] in the north. In 2019, the [[Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route]] bypass was completed
* The A96 links [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and [[Inverness]] and the north-west
* The A93 is the main route to the west, heading towards Royal Deeside and the [[Cairngorms]]. After [[Braemar]], it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. 
* The A944 also heads west, through [[Westhill, Aberdeenshire|Westhill]] and on to [[Alford, Aberdeenshire|Alford]]. 
* The A92 was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90; it is now used as a tourist route, connecting the city to the towns of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Arbroath]], and to the east coast.
* The A947 exits the city at [[Dyce]] and continues to [[Newmachar]], [[Oldmeldrum]], [[Turriff]], [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] and [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consultation.aberdeencity.gov.uk/place/a947-bucksburn-roundabout-to-parkhill-junction-mul/|title=A947 Bucksburn Roundabout to Parkhill Junction Multi-Modal Corridor Study|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|date=22 July 2022|access-date=8 October 2022|archive-date=8 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008153637/https://consultation.aberdeencity.gov.uk/place/a947-bucksburn-roundabout-to-parkhill-junction-mul/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Robert Gordon's College]] (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) was founded in 1750 by the merchant [[Robert Gordon (philanthropist)|Robert Gordon]],<ref name=EB/> grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor [[Burgesses of Guild of Aberdeen|burgesses of guild]] and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a [[Central Institution]] and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became [[Robert Gordon University]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our History {{!}} About {{!}} RGU|url=https://www.rgu.ac.uk/about/our-history|access-date=8 July 2020|website=rgu.ac.uk|archive-date=9 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709020959/https://www.rgu.ac.uk/about/our-history|url-status=live}}</ref> The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.

The citation for the 2011 award read: "With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year".<ref>''The Sunday Times'', 12 September 2010 (subscription only).</ref>

Aberdeen is also home to two artistic schools: [[Gray's School of Art]], founded in 1886, which is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK. [[Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and Built Environment]], was one of the first architectural schools to have its training courses recognised by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]. Both are now part of [[Robert Gordon University]] and are based at its Garthdee campus. [[North East Scotland College]] has several campuses in the city and offers a wide variety of part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications in science. The [[Scottish Agricultural College]] is based just outside Aberdeen, on the Craibstone Estate. This is situated beside the roundabout for Aberdeen Airport on the A96. The college provides three services—Learning, Research and Consultancy. The college features many land-based courses such as Agriculture, Countryside Management, Sustainable Environmental Management and Rural Business Management. There are a variety of courses from diplomas to master's degrees. The [[Marine Laboratory Aberdeen]], which specialises in fisheries, [[Macaulay Land Use Research Institute]] (soil science), and the [[Rowett Research Institute]] (animal nutrition) are some other higher education institutions.<ref name=EB/>
