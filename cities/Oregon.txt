It is a part of the [[Western U.S.]], with the [[Columbia River]] delineating much of Oregon's northern boundary with [[Washington (state)|Washington]], while the [[Snake River]] delineates much of its eastern boundary with [[Idaho]]. The [[42nd parallel north|42° north parallel]] delineates the southern boundary with [[California]] and [[Nevada]]. The western boundary is formed by the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Oregon has been home to many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] nations for thousands of years. The first European traders, explorers, and settlers began exploring what is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early to mid-16th century. As early as 1564, the [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|Spanish]] began sending vessels northeast from the [[Philippines]], riding the [[Kuroshio Current]] in a sweeping circular route across the northern part of the Pacific. In 1592, [[Juan de Fuca]] undertook detailed mapping and studies of ocean currents in the Pacific Northwest, including the Oregon coast as well as the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|strait]] now bearing his name. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] traversed Oregon in the early 1800s, and the first permanent European settlements in Oregon were established by fur trappers and traders. In 1843, an autonomous government was formed in the [[Oregon Country]], and the [[Oregon Territory]] was created in 1848. Oregon became the 33rd state of the U.S. on February 14, 1859.

Today, with 4.2 million people over {{convert|98000|sqmi|km2}}, Oregon is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|ninth largest]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|27th most populous]] U.S. state.

==Etymology==

{{Main|Etymology of Oregon}}
[[File:2014-07-06 14 49 35 View north along Harney County Route 201 (Fields-Denio Road) at the end of Nevada State Route 292 (Denio Road) at the Oregon border in Denio, Nevada.JPG|thumb|Oregon border [[welcome sign]] at [[Denio, Nevada]]|left]]

The origin of the state's name is uncertain. The earliest geographical designation "orejón" (meaning "big ear") comes from the Spanish historical chronicle ''Relación de la Alta y Baja California'' (1598),{{Sfn|Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes|1988|p=149}} written by Rodrigo Montezuma of [[New Spain]]; here it refers to the region of the [[Columbia River]] as it was encountered by the first Spanish scouts. The "{{lang|es|j}}" in the Spanish phrase "{{lang|es|El Orejón}}" was eventually corrupted into a "g".{{Sfn| Johnson |1904 | p=51}}

Another possible source is the Spanish word {{lang|es|[[oregano]]}}, which refers to a plant that grows in the southern part of the region.

It is also possible that the area around the Columbia River was named after a stream in [[Spain]] called "Arroyo del Oregón", located in the province of [[Ciudad Real]].

Another early use of the name, spelled ''Ouragon'', was by Major [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] in a 1765 petition to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The term referred to the then-mythical River of the West (the Columbia River). By 1778, the spelling had shifted to ''Oregon''.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/almanac/m-n.aspx |title = Oregon Blue Book: Oregon Almanac: Mountains to National Wildlife Refuges |access-date = October 23, 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181024073600/https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/almanac/m-n.aspx |archive-date = October 24, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref> Rogers wrote:

One suggestion is that this name comes from the French word {{lang|fr|ouragan}} ("windstorm" or "hurricane"), which was applied to the River of the West based on Native American tales of powerful [[Chinook wind]]s on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from first-hand French experience with the Chinook winds of the [[Great Plains]]. At the time, the River of the West was thought to rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the Great Plains.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Elliott |first = T.C. |date = June 1921 |title = The Origin of the Name Oregon |journal = Oregon Historical Quarterly |volume = XXIII |issue = 2 |issn = 0030-4727 |oclc = 1714620 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P-oXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA99 |pages = 99–100 |via = Google Books |access-date = June 27, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905225448/https://books.google.com/books?id=P-oXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA99 |archive-date = September 5, 2015 |url-status = live }} {{Open access}}</ref>

Another suggestion comes from [[Joaquin Miller]], who wrote in [[Sunset (magazine)|''Sunset'' magazine]] in 1904:
<blockquote>The name, Oregon, is rounded down phonetically, from ''Ouve água''—Oragua, Or-a-gon, Oregon—given probably by the same Portuguese navigator that named the Farallones after his first officer, and it literally, in a large way, means cascades: "Hear the waters." You should steam up the Columbia and hear and feel the waters falling out of the clouds of [[Mount Hood]] to understand entirely the full meaning of the name ''Ouve a água'', Oregon.<ref>{{cite journal |url = https://archive.org/details/sunset01deptgoog/page/n418/mode/2up |author = Miller, Joaquin |title = The Sea of Silence |journal = Sunset |volume = XIII |number = 5 |date = September 1904 |pages = 395–396 |via = Internet Archive }} {{Open access}}</ref></blockquote>

Yet another account, endorsed as the "most plausible explanation" in the book ''[[Oregon Geographic Names]]'', was advanced by [[George R. Stewart]] in a 1944 article in ''[[American Speech]]''. According to Stewart, the name came from an engraver's error in a French map published in the early 18th&nbsp;century, on which the [[Wisconsin River|Ouisiconsink (Wisconsin) River]] was spelled "{{lang|fr|Ouaricon-sint}}", broken on two lines with the {{lang|fr|-sint}} below, so there appeared to be a river flowing to the west named "{{lang|fr|Ouaricon}}".

While there is considerable evidence that [[Paleo-Indians]] inhabited the region, the oldest evidence of habitation in Oregon was found at [[Fort Rock Cave]] and the [[Paisley Caves]] in [[Lake County, Oregon|Lake County]]. Archaeologist [[Luther Cressman]] dated material from Fort Rock to 13,200 years ago,{{Sfn|Robbins|2005}} and there is evidence supporting inhabitants in the region at least 15,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.latimes.com/science/la-xpm-2012-jul-12-la-sci-sn-paisley-caves-20120712-story.html |website = The Los Angeles Times |title = Who was first?

The first Europeans to visit Oregon were Spanish explorers led by [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], who sighted southern Oregon off the Pacific coast in 1543.{{Sfn|Hemming|2008|pages=140–141}} Sailing from Central America on the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' in 1579 in search of the [[Strait of Anian]] during [[Francis Drake's circumnavigation|his circumnavigation of the Earth]], the English explorer and privateer Sir [[Francis Drake]] briefly anchored at [[Cape Arago State Park|South Cove, Cape Arago]], just south of [[Coos Bay, Oregon|Coos Bay]], before sailing for what is now California.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Drake's First Landfall |journal= Pacific Discovery, California Academy of Sciences|author-link1=Edward Von der Porten |first=Edward |last=Von der Porten |volume=28 |issue=1 |date= January 1975 |pages=28–30}}</ref>{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=39}} [[Martín de Aguilar]], continuing separately from [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]]'s scouting of California, reached as far north as [[Cape Blanco (Oregon)|Cape Blanco]] and possibly to Coos Bay in 1603.<ref name="Cogswell">{{cite book|last=Cogswell|first=Philip Jr.|title=Capitol Names: Individuals Woven Into Oregon's History|publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]]|year=1977|location=Portland, OR|pages=9–10}}</ref><ref name="OE">{{cite web|last=LaLande|first=Jeff|title=Cape Blanco|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/cape_blanco/|access-date=April 28, 2014|publisher=[[The Oregon Encyclopedia]]|archive-date=May 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520233116/http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/cape_blanco/|url-status=live}}</ref> Exploration continued routinely in 1774, starting with the expedition of the frigate ''Santiago'' by [[Juan José Pérez Hernández]], and the coast of Oregon became a valuable trade route to Asia. In 1778, British captain [[James Cook]] also explored the coast.{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|pages=64–65}}

[[French Canadians]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Métis]], and other continental natives (e.g. [[Iroquois]]) trappers arrived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, soon to be followed by Catholic clergy. Some traveled as members of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] and Astor Expeditions. Few stayed permanently such as Étienne Lussier, often referred to as the first "European" farmer in the state of Oregon. Evidence of the French Canadian presence can be found in numerous names of French origin such as [[Malheur Lake]], the [[Malheur River|Malheur]], [[Grande Ronde River|Grande Ronde]], and [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes Rivers]], and the city of [[La Grande, Oregon|La Grande]]. Furthermore, many of the early pioneers first came out West with the [[North West Company]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] before heading South of the Columbia for better farmland as the fur trade declined. [[French Prairie]] by the [[Willamette River]] and [[French Settlement, Oregon|French Settlement]] by the [[Umpqua River]] are known as early mixed ancestry settlements.
[[File:Franchere fort astoria 1813.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Astoria]], as established by [[John Jacob Astor]] in 1813]]

The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled through northern Oregon also in search of the [[Northwest Passage]]. They built their winter fort in 1805–1806 at [[Fort Clatsop]], near the mouth of the Columbia River, staying at the encampment from December until March.{{Sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=326}}

British explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] also conducted overland exploration. In 1811, while working for the North West Company, Thompson became the first European to navigate the entire Columbia River.{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|pages=145–146}} Stopping on the way, at the junction of the Snake River, he posted a claim to the region for [[Great Britain]] and the North West Company. Upon returning to [[Montreal]], he publicized the abundance of fur-bearing animals in the area.{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=146}}

Also in 1811, New Yorker [[John Jacob Astor]] financed the establishment of [[Fort Astoria]] at the mouth of the Columbia River as a western outpost to his [[Pacific Fur Company]];{{Sfn|Loy|Allan|Buckley|Meacham|2001|pages=12–13}} this was the first permanent European settlement in Oregon.

In the [[War of 1812]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] gained control of all Pacific Fur Company posts. The [[Treaty of 1818]] established joint British and American occupancy of the region west of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. By the 1820s and 1830s, the Hudson's Bay Company dominated the Pacific Northwest from its [[Columbia District]] headquarters at [[Fort Vancouver]] (built in 1825 by the district's chief factor, [[John McLoughlin]], across the Columbia from present-day [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]).

In 1841, the expert trapper and entrepreneur [[Ewing Young]] died leaving considerable wealth and no apparent heir, and no system to [[probate]] his estate. A meeting followed Young's funeral, at which a probate government was proposed.{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=221}} Doctor [[Ira Babcock]] of [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]]'s [[Methodist Mission]] was elected supreme judge.{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=207}} Babcock chaired two meetings in 1842 at [[Champoeg, Oregon|Champoeg]], (halfway between Lee's mission and [[Oregon City]]), to discuss [[Gray wolf|wolves]] and other animals of contemporary concern. These meetings were precursors to an [[Champoeg Meetings|all-citizen meeting]] in 1843, which instituted a provisional government headed by an [[Executive Committee (Oregon Country)|executive committee]] made up of [[David Hill (Oregon politician)|David Hill]], [[Alanson Beers]], and [[Joseph Gale]].{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=226}} This government was the first acting public government of the [[Oregon Country]] before annexation by the government of the United States. It was succeeded by a Second Executive Committee, made up of [[Peter G. Stewart]], [[Osborne Russell]], and [[William J. Bailey]], and this committee was itself succeeded by [[George Abernethy]], who was the first and only Governor of Oregon under the provisional government.

Also in 1841, Sir [[George Simpson (HBC administrator)|George Simpson]], governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, reversed the Hudson's Bay Company's long-standing policy of discouraging settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade.{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=215}} He directed that some 200 [[Red River Colony]] settlers be relocated to HBC farms near Fort Vancouver, (the [[James Sinclair (fur trapper)|James Sinclair]] expedition), in an attempt to hold Columbia District.

Starting in 1842–1843, the [[Oregon Trail]] brought many new American settlers to the Oregon Country. [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon's boundaries were disputed]] for a time, contributing to tensions between the U.K. and the U.S., but the border was defined peacefully in the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]]. The border between the U.S. and [[British North America]] was set at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]].{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=273}} The [[Oregon Territory]] was officially organized on August 13, 1848.{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=285}}

Settlement increased with the [[Donation Land Claim Act]] of 1850 and the [[Population transfer|forced relocation]] of the native population to [[List of Indian reservations in Oregon|Indian reservations in Oregon]].

The first Oregon proposition for a railroad in Oregon was made in 1850 by H.&nbsp;M. Knighton, the original owner of the townsite of [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]]. Knighton asserted that this would fulfill his township's belief that it should be the supreme metropolitan seaport in that area upon the Columbia River, as opposed to Portland. He suggested building a railroad in 1851 from St.&nbsp;Helens, through the Cornelius pass and across [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] to the city of Lafayette, which was at the time the big town of the Willamette Valley.<ref>Joseph Gaston, 1912, The Centennial History of Oregon, 1811–1912, vol.1, S.J.

===Black exclusion laws===
In December 1844, Oregon passed its first [[Oregon black exclusion laws|black exclusion law]], which prohibited [[African Americans]] from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Slave owners who brought their slaves with them were given three years before they were forced to free them. Any African Americans in the region after the law was passed were forced to leave, and those who did not comply were arrested and beaten. They received no less than twenty and no more than thirty-nine stripes across the back if they still did not leave. This process could be repeated every six months.<ref>{{cite journal |author = McClintock, Thomas C. |title = James Saules, Peter Burnett, and the Oregon Black Exclusion Law of June 1844 |journal = The Pacific Northwest Quarterly |volume = 86 |number = 3 |date = July 1, 1995 |page = 122 }}</ref>

===Statehood===
Slavery played a major part in Oregon's history and even influenced its path to statehood. The territory's request for [[State (polity)|statehood]] was delayed several times, as members of Congress argued among themselves whether the territory should be admitted as a "free" or "slave" state. Eventually politicians from the South agreed to allow Oregon to enter as a "free" state, in exchange for opening slavery to the Southwestern U.S.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Mahoney |first = Barbara |title = Oregon Voices: Oregon Democracy: Asahel Bush, Slavery, and the Statehood Debate |journal = Oregon Historical Quarterly |volume = 110 |number = 2 |date = July 1, 2009 |page = 202 |doi = 10.1353/ohq.2009.0099 |s2cid = 159872966 |issn = 0030-4727 }}</ref>

Industrial expansion began in earnest following the 1933–1937 construction of the [[Bonneville Dam]] on the Columbia River. [[Hydroelectric power]], food, and lumber provided by Oregon helped fuel the development of the West, although the periodic fluctuations in the U.S. building industry have hurt the state's economy on multiple occasions. Portland, in particular, experienced a population boom between 1900 and 1930, tripling in size; the arrival of World War II also provided the northwest region of the state with an industrial boom, where [[Liberty ship]]s and aircraft carriers were constructed.<ref name="ohs2003toll">{{cite web |title = Home Front Boom |first = William |last = Toll |year = 2003 |url = http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/narratives/subtopic.cfm?subtopic_ID=213 |publisher = [[Oregon Historical Society]] |access-date = October 30, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110609021755/http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/narratives/subtopic.cfm?subtopic_ID=213 |archive-date = June 9, 2011 }}</ref>

Oregon is split into eight geographical regions. In [[Western Oregon]]: [[Oregon Coast]] (west of the [[Oregon Coast Range|Coast Range]]), the Willamette Valley, [[Rogue Valley]], [[Cascade Range]] and [[Klamath Mountains]]; and in [[Central Oregon|Central]] and [[Eastern Oregon]]: the [[Columbia Plateau]], the [[High Desert (Oregon)|High Desert]], and the [[Blue Mountains (ecoregion)|Blue Mountains]].

Oregon lies in two [[time zone]]s. Most of [[Malheur County, Oregon|Malheur County]] is in the [[Mountain Time Zone]], while the rest of the state lies in the [[Pacific Time Zone]].

[[File:Mt. Hood (8081466807).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Hood]] is the highest peak in Oregon.]]

Western Oregon's mountainous regions, home to three of the [[List of the most prominent summits of the United States|most prominent mountain peaks of the U.S.]] including Mount Hood, were formed by the [[volcanic]] activity of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]], a [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] that poses a continued threat of volcanic activity and earthquakes in the region. The most recent major activity was the [[1700 Cascadia earthquake]].<ref>{{cite news |title=A Major Earthquake in the Pacific Northwest Looks Even Likelier |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/08/a-major-earthquake-in-the-pacific-northwest-just-got-more-likely/495407/ |work=The Atlantic |date=August 16, 2016 |access-date=November 1, 2020 |archive-date=September 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902173553/https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/08/a-major-earthquake-in-the-pacific-northwest-just-got-more-likely/495407/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted in 1980]], an event visible from northern Oregon and affecting some areas there.<ref>{{cite news |title = Oregon volcano may be warming up for an eruption |work = Christian Science Monitor |date = March 27, 1980 |author = Ray, Dewey |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0327/032754.html |access-date = October 31, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120629144823/http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0327/032754.html |archive-date = June 29, 2012 |url-status = live }}</ref>

The Columbia River, which forms much of Oregon's northern border, also played a major role in the region's geological evolution, as well as its economic and cultural development. The Columbia is one of North America's largest rivers, and one of two rivers to cut through the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] (the [[Klamath River]] in southern Oregon is the other). About 15,000 years ago, the Columbia repeatedly flooded much of Oregon during the [[Missoula Floods]]; the modern fertility of the Willamette Valley is largely the result. Plentiful [[salmon]] made parts of the river, such as [[Celilo Falls]], hubs of economic activity for thousands of years.

Today, Oregon's landscape varies from [[rain forest]] in the Coast Range to barren desert in the southeast, which still meets the technical definition of a [[frontier]]. Oregon's [[Centroid|geographical center]] is further west than any of the other 48 contiguous states (although the westernmost point of the lower 48 states is in Washington). [[Central Oregon]]'s geographical features range from [[High Desert (Oregon)|high desert]] and volcanic rock formations resulting from [[lava bed]]s. The [[Oregon Badlands Wilderness]] is in this region of the state.<ref>{{cite book |title = Congressional Record Vol. 155 Part 1: Proceedings and Debates of the 111th Congress: First Session |publisher = Government Printing Office |page = 935 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I4OdyBwCpA0C&q=oregon+badlands&pg=PA935 |via = [[Google Books]] |access-date = November 18, 2020 |archive-date = February 20, 2021 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210220153252/https://books.google.com/books?id=I4OdyBwCpA0C&q=oregon+badlands&pg=PA935 |url-status = live }} {{Open access}}</ref>

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of Oregon}}
[[File:Oregon Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in Oregon]]
Most of Oregon has a generally mild climate, though there is significant variation given the variety of landscapes across the state.<ref>{{cite book|title= Oregon|author=Hamilton, John|page=14|publisher=ABDO|year=2016|isbn=978-1-680-77443-6}}</ref> The state's western region (west of the [[Cascade Range]]) has an [[oceanic climate]], populated by dense [[Temperate rainforest|evergreen]] mixed forests. Western Oregon's climate is heavily influenced by the Pacific Ocean; the western third of Oregon is very wet in the winter, moderately to very wet during the spring and fall, and dry during the summer. The [[relative humidity]] of Western Oregon is high except during summer days, which are semi-dry to semi-humid; Eastern Oregon typically sees low humidity year-round.<ref name=dri />

The state's southwestern portion, particularly the [[Rogue Valley]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with drier and sunnier winters and hotter summers, similar to [[Northern California]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://extension.oregonstate.edu/josephine/sites/default/files/weather_joco_2013_0.pdf |website = Oregon State University |title = Rogue Valley Weather and Climate |author = Jones, Gregory V. |access-date = December 9, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120357/http://extension.oregonstate.edu/josephine/sites/default/files/weather_joco_2013_0.pdf |archive-date = December 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Oregon's northeastern portion has a [[steppe climate]], and its high terrain regions have a [[subarctic climate]].

Vast forests have historically made Oregon one of the nation's major [[Lumber|timber]]-producing and logging states, but forest fires (such as the [[Tillamook Burn]]), over-harvesting, and lawsuits over the proper management of the extensive federal forest holdings have reduced the timber produced. Between 1989 and 2011, the amount of timber harvested from federal lands in Oregon dropped about 90%, although harvest levels on private land have remained relatively constant.<ref>{{cite web |title = Oregon Forest Facts & Figures 2013 |publisher = Oregon Forest Resources Institute |url = http://oregonforests.org/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/OR_Forest_Facts_and_Figures_2013.pdf |page = 3 |access-date = May 31, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140712050626/http://oregonforests.org/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/OR_Forest_Facts_and_Figures_2013.pdf |archive-date = July 12, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Even the shift in recent years towards finished goods such as paper and building materials has not slowed the decline of the timber industry in the state. The effects of this decline have included [[Weyerhaeuser]]'s acquisition of Portland-based [[Willamette Industries]] in January 2002, the relocation of [[Louisiana-Pacific]]'s corporate headquarters from Portland to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and the decline of former lumber [[company town]]s such as [[Gilchrist, Oregon|Gilchrist]]. Despite these changes, Oregon still leads the U.S. in [[softwood]] lumber production; in 2011, {{convert|4134|e6board feet}} was produced in Oregon, compared with {{convert|3685|e6board feet}} in Washington, {{convert|1914|e6board feet}} in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and {{convert|1708|e6board feet}} in [[Mississippi]].<ref>"Oregon Forest Facts & Figures 2013", p. 12</ref> The slowing of the timber and [[Wood industry|lumber industry]] has caused high unemployment rates in rural areas.<ref name="referencedesk">{{cite web |url = http://www.e-referencedesk.com/resources/state-economy/oregon.html |title = Oregon Economy |publisher = e-ReferenceDesk |access-date = November 5, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928213611/http://www.e-referencedesk.com/resources/state-economy/oregon.html |archive-date = September 28, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

[[Reed College]], a rigorous liberal arts college in Portland, was ranked by ''[[Forbes]]'' as the 52nd best college in the country in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.forbes.com/colleges/reed-college/ |website = Forbes |title = Reed College |access-date = September 11, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150911204607/http://www.forbes.com/colleges/reed-college/ |archive-date = September 11, 2015 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Other private institutions in Portland include [[Lewis & Clark College]]; [[Multnomah University]]; [[Portland Bible College]]; [[Warner Pacific College]]; [[Cascade College]]; the [[National University of Natural Medicine]]; and [[Western Seminary]], a theological graduate school. [[Pacific University]] is in the Portland suburb of [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]]. There are also private colleges further south in the Willamette Valley. McMinnville is home to [[Linfield College]], while nearby Newberg is home to [[George Fox University]]. Salem is home to two private schools: [[Willamette University]] (the state's oldest, established during the provisional period) and [[Corban University]]. Also located near Salem is [[Mount Angel Abbey|Mount Angel Seminary]], one of America's largest Roman Catholic seminaries.

A writer in the [[Oregon Country]] book ''A Pacific Republic'', written in 1839, predicted the territory was to become an independent republic. Four years later, in 1843, settlers of the Willamette Valley voted in majority for a republican form of government.<ref>Allen, Cain (2006). [http://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/a-pacific-republic/ "A Pacific Republic"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827132454/https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/a-pacific-republic/ |date=August 27, 2016 }}. ''The Oregon History Project''. Oregon Historical Society. Retrieved June 17, 2016.</ref> The Oregon Country functioned in this way until August 13, 1848, when Oregon was annexed by the U.S. and a territorial government was established. Oregon maintained a territorial government until February 14, 1859, when it was granted [[U.S. state|statehood]].{{Sfn|Johnson|1904|p=296}}

===Structure===
Oregon state government has a [[separation of powers]] similar to the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]], with three branches:
* a [[legislature|legislative branch]] (the [[bicameral]] [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]]),
* an [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] which includes an "administrative department" and [[Governor of Oregon|Oregon's governor]] as chief executive, and
* a [[Judiciary|judicial branch]], headed by the [[Chief justice|Chief Justice]] of the [[Oregon Supreme Court]].

Governors in Oregon serve four-year terms and are limited to two consecutive terms, but an unlimited number of total terms. Oregon has no [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]; in case the office of governor is vacated, Article{{nbsp}}V, Section 8a of the [[Oregon Constitution]] specifies that the [[Oregon Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] is first in line for succession.<ref name="articlev">{{cite web |title = Constitution of Oregon (Article V) |year = 2007 |website = Oregon Blue Book |publisher = State of Oregon |url = https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/state-constitution.aspx |access-date = March 12, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181024073529/https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/state-constitution.aspx |archive-date = October 24, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref> The other statewide officers are [[Oregon State Treasurer|Treasurer]], [[Oregon Attorney General|Attorney General]], and [[Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries|Labor Commissioner]].

The [[wikt:Biennial|biennial]] [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] consists of a thirty-member [[Oregon State Senate|Senate]] and a sixty-member [[Oregon House of Representatives|House]]. A debate over whether to move to annual sessions is a long-standing battle in Oregon politics, but the voters have resisted the move from citizen legislators to professional lawmakers. Because Oregon's state budget is written in two-year increments and, there being no sales tax, state revenue is based largely on income taxes, it is often significantly over or under budget. Recent legislatures have had to be called into special sessions repeatedly to address revenue shortfalls resulting from economic downturns, bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions. Oregon Initiative 71, passed in 2010, mandates the legislature to begin meeting every year, for 160 days in odd-numbered years, and 35 days in even-numbered years.

The state supreme court has seven elected justices, currently including the only two openly gay state supreme court justices in the nation. They choose one of their own to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice.

===Ballot measures===
Oregon's constitution provides for [[ballot measure|ballot initiatives]] voted upon by the electorate in general.  In the 2002 general election, Oregon voters approved a [[Oregon Ballot Measure 25 (2002)|ballot measure]] to increase the state minimum wage automatically each year according to inflationary changes, which are measured by the [[consumer price index]] (CPI).<ref>{{cite web |title = Ors 653.025 |url = https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors653.html |website = State of Oregon |access-date = January 29, 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190130053355/https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors653.html |archive-date = January 30, 2019 |url-status = live }}</ref> In the 2004 general election, Oregon voters passed ballot measures [[Oregon Ballot Measure 36 (2004)|banning same-sex marriage]]<ref>{{cite web |url = https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx |title = November 2, 2004, General Election Abstract of Votes: STATE MEASURE NO. 36 |format = PDF |publisher = [[Oregon Secretary of State]] |access-date = November 17, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211011959/http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx |archive-date = December 11, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> and [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)|restricting land use regulation]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Bradbury |first = Bill |author-link = Bill Bradbury |title = Official Results—November 6, 2007 Special Election |website = Elections Division |publisher = [[Oregon Secretary of State]] |date = November 6, 2007 |url = https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx |access-date = December 27, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211011959/http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx |archive-date = December 11, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> In the [[Oregon's statewide elections, 2006|2006 general election]], voters restricted the use of [[Oregon Ballot Measure 39 (2006)|eminent domain]] and extended the state's discount prescription drug coverage.<ref>{{cite web |title = November 7, 2006, general election abstracts of votes: state measure no. 39 |url = https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx |publisher = State of Oregon |format = PDF |access-date = March 12, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211011959/http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx |archive-date = December 11, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref>

In the 2020 general election, Oregon voters approved a [[2020 Oregon Ballot Measure 110|ballot measure]] decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of street drugs such as cocaine and heroin, becoming the first state in the country to do so after the drugs were originally made illegal.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Levin|first1=Sam|date=November 4, 2020|title=Oregon becomes first US state to decriminalize possession of hard drugs|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/03/oregon-drugs-decriminalize-arizona-new-jersey-marijuana|access-date=November 4, 2020|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=November 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201104074027/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/03/oregon-drugs-decriminalize-arizona-new-jersey-marijuana|url-status=live}}</ref> The initiative has been described as a mixed success after three years of implementation, and calls for change arose.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oregon cities join police, prosecutors in push to recriminalize drug possession |url=https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/02/oregon-cities-police-prosecutors-pushs-recriminalize-drug-possession/ |access-date=2024-02-02 |website=opb |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kim |first=E.

===Federal representation===

Like all U.S. states, Oregon is represented by two [[United States Senate|senators]]. Following the [[1980 United States census|1980 census]], Oregon had five [[Oregon's congressional districts|congressional districts]]. After Oregon was admitted to the Union, it began with a single member in the House of Representatives ([[La Fayette Grover]], who served in the [[35th U.S. Congress]] for less than a month). [[United States congressional apportionment|Congressional apportionment]] increased the size of the delegation following the censuses of [[1890 United States Census|1890]], [[1910 United States Census|1910]], [[1940 United States Census|1940]], and 1980. Following the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], Oregon gained a sixth congressional seat. It was filled in the [[2022 United States House of Representatives elections|2022 Congressional Elections]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opb.org/article/2021/04/26/oregon-6th-seat-congress-us-census/|title=Oregon to get 6th seat in Congress|first=Dirk|last=VanderHart|publisher=[[Oregon Public Broadcasting]]|access-date=April 30, 2021|archive-date=April 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429040600/https://www.opb.org/article/2021/04/26/oregon-6th-seat-congress-us-census/|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[United States congressional delegations from Oregon|detailed list of the past and present Congressional delegations from Oregon]] is available.

The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon]] hears federal cases in the state. The court has courthouses in [[Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse|Portland]], [[Wayne L. Morse United States Courthouse|Eugene]], Medford, and Pendleton. Also in Portland is the federal bankruptcy court, with a second branch in Eugene.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.orb.uscourts.gov/ |title = United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Oregon |publisher = U.S. Courts |access-date = December 14, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19991129005743/http://www.orb.uscourts.gov/ |archive-date = November 29, 1999 |url-status = live }}</ref> Oregon (among other western states and territories) is in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Court of Appeals]]. One of the court's meeting places is at the [[Pioneer Courthouse]] in downtown Portland, a [[National Historic Landmark]] built in 1869.

Political opinions in Oregon are geographically split by the [[Cascade Range]], with [[Western Oregon]] being more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Eastern Oregon]] being [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/05/politics_of_place_in_northeast.html |website = The Oregonian |title = Politics of Place: In northeastern Oregon, politics revolve around natural resources |author = Kost, Ryan |date = May 5, 2012 |access-date = April 17, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170525074216/http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/05/politics_of_place_in_northeast.html |archive-date = May 25, 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref> In a 2008 analysis of the 2004 presidential election, a political analyst found that according to the application of a [[Likert scale]], Oregon boasted both the most liberal Kerry voters and the most conservative Bush voters, making it the most politically polarized state in the country.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/05/oregon-swing-state-or-latte-drinking.html |agency = FiveThirtyEight.com |first = Nate |last = Silver |author-link = Nate Silver |title = Oregon: Swing state or latte-drinking, Prius-driving lesbian commune? |date = May 17, 2008 |access-date = February 24, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100307020113/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/05/oregon-swing-state-or-latte-drinking.html |archive-date = March 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The base of Democratic support is largely concentrated in the urban centers of the Willamette Valley. The eastern two-thirds of the state beyond the Cascade Mountains typically votes Republican; in 2000 and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], [[George W. Bush]] carried every county east of the Cascades. However, the region's sparse population means the more populous counties in the Willamette Valley usually outweigh the eastern counties in statewide elections. 
In 2008, for instance, Republican Senate incumbent [[Gordon H. Smith]] lost his bid for a third term, even though he [[2008 United States Senate election in Oregon|carried all but eight counties]]. His Democratic challenger, Jeff Merkley, won Multnomah County by 142,000 votes, more than double the overall margin of victory. Oregonians have voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate in every election since 1988. In 2004 and 2006, Democrats won control of the State Senate, and then the House. Since 2023, Oregon has been represented by four Democrats and two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. Since 2009, the state has had two Democratic U.S. senators, [[Ron Wyden]] and [[Jeff Merkley]]. Oregon voters have elected Democratic governors in every election since 1986, most recently electing [[Tina Kotek]] over Republican [[Christine Drazan]] and Independent [[Betsy Johnson]] in the 2022 gubernatorial election.

During Oregon's history, it has adopted many electoral reforms proposed during the [[Progressive Era]], through the efforts of [[William Simon U'Ren|William S. U'Ren]] and his [[Direct Legislation League]]. Under his leadership, the state overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure in 1902 that created the [[Popular initiative|initiative]] and [[referendum]] for citizens to introduce or approve proposed laws or amendments to the state constitution directly, making Oregon the first state to adopt such a system. Today, roughly half of U.S. states do so.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i&r.htm |publisher = State Initiative & Referendum Institute at USC |title = State Initiative and Referendum Summary |access-date = November 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160211180917/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm |archive-date = February 11, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

In following years, the [[Partisan primary|primary election]] to select [[Political party|party]] candidates was adopted in 1904, and in 1908 the Oregon Constitution was amended to include recall of public officials. More recent amendments include the nation's first doctor-assisted suicide law,<ref>{{cite web |title = Eighth Annual Report on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act |publisher = Oregon Department of Human Services |date = March 9, 2006 |url = http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/docs/year8.pdf |access-date = June 11, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614111336/http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/docs/year8.pdf |archive-date = June 14, 2007 |url-status = live }}</ref> called the [[1994 Oregon Ballot Measure 16|Death with Dignity Act]] (which was challenged, unsuccessfully, in 2005 by the [[Presidency of George W.

However, a further ballot measure in 2007, [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)#Measure 49|Measure 49]], curtailed many of the provisions of 37.

Of the [[List of Oregon ballot measures|measures placed on the ballot]] since 1902, the people have passed 99 of the 288 initiatives and 25 of the 61 referendums on the ballot, though not all of them survived challenges in courts (see ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', for an example). During the same period, the legislature has referred 363 measures to the people, of which 206 have passed.

Oregon pioneered the American use of [[postal voting]], beginning with experimentation approved by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] in 1981 and culminating with a [[Oregon Ballot Measure 60 (1998)|1998 ballot measure]] mandating that all counties conduct elections by mail. It remains one of just two states, the other being Washington, where [[Absentee ballot|voting by mail]] is the only method of voting.

In 1994, Oregon adopted the Oregon Health Plan, which made health care available to most of its citizens without private health insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.oregon.gov/oha/healthplan/DataReportsDocs/Oregon%20Health%20Plan%20-%20An%20historical%20overview.pdf |website = Oregon Department of Human Services |title = Oregon Health Plan: An Historical Review |access-date = December 28, 2016 |date = July 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170525082628/https://www.oregon.gov/oha/healthplan/DataReportsDocs/Oregon%20Health%20Plan%20-%20An%20historical%20overview.pdf |archive-date = May 25, 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref>
