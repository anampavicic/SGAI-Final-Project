'''Dnipropetrovsk Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Дніпропетровська область|translit=Dnipropetrovska oblast}}), is an [[administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) in simultaneously southern, eastern and central [[Ukraine]], the most important industrial region of the country. It was created on February 27, 1932. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has a population of about {{Ua-pop-est2022|3,096,485|punct=,}} approximately 80% of whom live centering on [[administrative center]]s: [[Dnipro]], [[Kryvyi Rih]], [[Kamianske]], [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] and [[Pavlohrad]]. The [[Dnieper|Dnieper River]] runs through the oblast.

==Geography==
The Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is located by most part in eastern Ukraine (like [[Dnipro Raion]] and other eastern more raions), though it has some parts in central (like [[Kamianske Raion]]) and southern ([[Nikopol Raion]]) Ukraine. The area of the oblast (31,974&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) comprises about 5.3% of the total area of the country. Its longitude from north to south is 130&nbsp;km, from east to west – 300&nbsp;km. The oblast borders the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava]] and [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]] oblasts on the north, the [[Donetsk Oblast]] on the east, the [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]] and [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] oblasts on the south, and the [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv]] and [[Kirovohrad Oblast|Kirovohrad]] oblasts on the west. Historically, it is located in the region of [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporizhzhia]].

The [[Black Sea Lowland]] covers about half of the territory of the oblast, where it lies only within the west bank of the Dnieper. In [[Ternivskyi District|Terny]], a [[Ternovka crater|Ternivsky meteorite crater]] is located. It is {{cvt|11|km}} in diameter and its age is estimated at 280 ± 10 million years ([[Permian]]). The crater is not exposed at the surface.<ref>{{cite Earth Impact DB | name = Ternovka| access-date = 2009-08-16}}</ref> The [[Dnieper Upland]] contains a number of minerals including [[Iron ore|iron]], [[manganese]], [[granite]], [[graphite]], [[brown coal]], and [[kaolin]]. [[Kryvbas]] is an important economic region, specializing in iron ore mining and the steel industry. It is arguably the main iron ore region of [[Eastern Europe]]. Named after the city of [[Kryvyi Rih]], the mining base of the region occupies the southwestern part of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, as well as the small neighboring parts of the [[Kirovohrad Oblast|Kirovohrad]] and [[Kherson Oblast]]s.<ref>[https://biz.nv.ua/ukr/amp/arselormittal-vidnoviv-virobnictvo-vapnyaku-v-hersonskiy-oblasti-yaki-obsyagi-50331634.html]{{in lang|uk}}</ref>

The region possesses major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded here in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih itself, which is the longest city in Europe (roughly {{convert|67|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a straight line from one end to another).

=== Geology ===
Much of the Dnipropetrovsk oblast is located within the boundaries of the [[Ukrainian Shield]] and only the northern regions and the extreme eastern part of the territory are confined to the south-eastern side of the Dnipro-Donets depression.

In the geological structure of the region, the breeds come from the archaea,{{clarify|mistranslation?|date=April 2022}} the [[Proterozoic]], the [[Paleozoic]], the [[Mesozoic]] and the [[Cenozoic]].

==History==
[[File:Delineatio generalis Camporum Desertorum vulgo Ukraina (1648).jpg|thumb|1648 map of [[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan|Beauplan]], with [[Wild Fields|Dzikie Pole]] (the Wild Fields) identified in upper portion of the map.]]
In the 6th to 8th centuries AD the first settlements of Slavs appeared on the banks of the Dnieper within the region. During the period of [[Kievan Rus']] (9th to 12th centuries AD) the Dnieper River functioned as one of the main trade corridors of medieval Eastern Europe, part of the route [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|"from the Varangians to the Greeks"]], which connected the Baltic Sea region with the [[Crimea]] and with the capital of [[Byzantium]], [[Constantinople]]. The Dnieper also served as a major route for transporting the armies of Kyiv princes on their way to the Byzantine coastal cities in the early 9th and late 9th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Kazhdan|first= Alexander |title= Dumbarton Oaks Hagiography Database|publisher=Trustees for Harvard University Washington, D.C.|year= 1998|pages= 44}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date= 2014-05-30|title= Primary chronicle|url= http://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140530225833/http://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf|archive-date= 2014-05-30|access-date=2020-06-11}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 15th century, [[Tatar]] tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. However, by the mid-15th century, the [[Nogais|Nogai]] (who lived north of the [[Sea of Azov]]) and the [[Crimean Khanate]] invaded these lands.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and farther east along the [[Samara (Dnieper)|Samara River]], i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipro. At this time there appeared a new force, the [[Cossacks]] - armed free men not subject to any feudal lord - who soon came to dominate the region. They later became known as [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], from [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporizhzhia]], the lands south of [[Dnieper Ukraine|Naddniprianshchyna]] (Zaporizhzhia translates to "the Land Beyond the [[Dnieper rapids|Rapids]]"). This period of raids and fighting caused considerable devastation and [[Population decline|depopulation]] in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic steppe]]; the area became known as the "Wilderness" or the "[[Wild Fields]]".

In 1635, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish government]] built the [[Kodak Fortress|Kodak fortress]] above the [[Dnieper Rapids]] at ''Kodaky'', partly as a result of rivalry in the region between Poland, [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]],<ref name=Go2Kiev>{{cite web|url= http://www.go2kiev.com/view/dnepropetrovsk.html|title= Go2Kiev Dnepropetrovsk|publisher= Go2kiev.com|access-date= 28 November 2014}}</ref> and partly to maintain control over Cossack activity (i.e. to suppress the Cossack raiders and to prevent peasants moving out of the area).<ref name=SerhiiPlokhy>Plokhy, Serhii, ''The Cossacks and Religion in Early Modern Ukraine'', pub Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-924739-0}}, pages 26, 37, 40, 51, 60–1, 142, 245, and 268.</ref> On the night of 3 or 4 August 1635, the Cossacks of [[Ivan Sulyma]] captured the fort by surprise, burning it down and butchering the garrison of about 200 West European mercenaries under Jean Marion.<ref name=SerhiiPlokhy/> The fort, rebuilt by French engineer [[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan]]<ref>Guillaume le Vasseur de Beauplan wrote a book ''Description d'Ukrainie'', published in 1651 and 1660.</ref> for the Polish government in 1638, had a mercenary garrison.<ref name=SerhiiPlokhy/> ''Kodak'' was captured by [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Cossacks]] on 1 October 1648, and was garrisoned by the Cossacks until its demolition in accordance with the [[Treaty of the Pruth]] in 1711.<ref name=Kodak_Pruth>[https://day.kyiv.ua/en/article/time-out/above-kodak www.day.kyiv.ua ''Above Kodak, this year the unique fortress marks its 375th anniversary''], by Mykola Chaban, 2010.</ref>

Under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] of 1654, the territory came within the sphere of influence of the Moscow-based [[Tsardom of Russia]]. In 1774 [[Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin|Prince Grigori Potemkin]] was appointed governor of [[Novorossiysk Governorate]], and after the [[Liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich|destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich]] in 1775, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers. The city of ''Yekaterinoslav'' (present-day Dnipro) was founded in 1776, not in its current location, but at the confluence of the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|River Samara]] with the River Kil'chen' at [[Loshakivka]], north of the Dnieper. On May 8, 1775, after the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russian-Turkish War of 1768 to 1774]], Russian authorities opened a [[Kryvyi Rih|postal station and track]] which linked [[Kremenchuk]] city, the [[Kinburn peninsula|Kinburn foreland]] and [[Ochakiv]], all locations of the Imperial Russian Army.

In December 1796, Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] re-established the Novorossiysk Governorate, mostly with land from the former [[Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty]]. In 1802, this province was divided into the [[Nikolayev Governorate]] (known as the Kherson Governorate from 1803), [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]], and the [[Taurida Governorate]]. The capital of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate was the city of [[Yekaterinoslav]] (modern Dnipro). It was located within the former lands of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. The governorate bordered to the north with the [[Kharkov Governorate]] and [[Poltava Governorate]], to the west and southwest with the [[Kherson Governorate]], to the south with the [[Taurida Governorate]] and [[Sea of Azov]], and to the east with the [[Don Host Oblast]].

[[Olexander Paul]] (1832–1890) discovered iron ore and initiated smelting,<ref>Sudrussland Mageteisen und Sisenglantztatten</ref><ref>Рубін П.Криворожский бассейн и его железные руды. Горный журнал, 1888 г., т. 1</ref> and this became the core of a developing a mining district.<ref>Конткевич С.

On 1 August 1925, the Yekaterinoslav Governorate administration was discontinued, and in 1926 the city of Yekterinoslav was renamed Dnipropetrovsk after Ukrainian Soviet [[leader]] [[Grigory Petrovsky]].<ref>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/05/15/7068057/ Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization].

In 1932 the territory of the Ukrainian SSR was re-organized into oblasts. The first oblasts were [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], [[Kyiv Oblast]], [[Odesa Oblast]], [[Kharkiv Oblast]], and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Soon after that, in the summer of 1932, [[Donetsk Oblast]] was formed out of eastern parts of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.

During the [[Holodomor]] in the 1930s, more than 200 [[collective farm]]s in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast were put on [[Blackboards (Soviet policies)|"Blackboards"]] which implied a complete blockade of trade and food-aid to villages under-performing in fulfilling grain-procurement quotas; a number representing more than half of all such "Blackboards" throughout all of the Ukrainian SSR.<ref name="blackboard">{{cite web |last1= Papakin |first1= Georgy |title="Чорні дошки" Голодомору - економічний метод знищення громадян УРСР (СПИСОК)|trans-title= Holodomor "Black Boards" - Economic Method of Destruction of USSR Citizens |url=http://www.istpravda.com.ua/research/2010/11/27/6591/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190103054050/http://www.istpravda.com.ua/research/2010/11/27/6591/ |url-status=live |archive-date=3 January 2019 |date=27 November 2010 |work=[[Istorychna Pravda]]}}</ref>

During the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|1991 referendum]], 90.36% of votes in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast favored the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]]. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 2.2% of the oblast's population supported their region joining Russia, 89.9% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.<ref name=DT150103>{{cite news |url= http://dt.ua/UKRAINE/lishe-3-ukrayinciv-hochut-priyednannya-yih-oblasti-do-rosiyi-160641_.html |script-title= uk:Лише 3% українців хочуть приєднання їх області до Росії |language= uk |trans-title= Only 3% of Ukrainians want their region to become part of Russia |work= [[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] |date= 3 January 2015}}</ref>

The region possesses major deposits of iron ore and some other metallurgical ores. To exploit them, several large mining companies were founded here in the middle of the 20th century. Most of them are located in Kryvyi Rih itself, which is the longest city in Europe. Steel companies of the region (except Mittal Steel-owned Kryvorizhstal) are controlled by either the [[Privat Group]] or the [[SCM Holdings|SCM]]. From the 1990s until 2004, these once united and state-owned industries went through a hard and scandal-ridden process of privatization. Being a business oligarch entity, Privat Group controls some prominent Ukrainian media, maintains close relations with politicians and sponsors professional sports. Key businesses of the group (including the [[PrivatBank]] itself) are based in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which is regarded as its "homeland". Group's founding owners are natives of Dnipropetrovsk and made their entire career there.

The Dnipro-Arena hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[England national football team|England]] on 10 October 2009. The Dnipro Arena was initially chosen as one of the Ukrainian venues for their joint Euro 2012 bid with Poland. However, it was dropped from the list in May 2009 as the capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/8499613|title=Kiev and Donetsk likely for Euro 2012, others uncertain|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|access-date=28 November 2014}}</ref>

==Culture==
Historically, Dnieper Ukraine comprised territory that roughly corresponded to the area of Ukraine within the expanding [[Russian Empire]]. Ukrainians sometimes call it Great Ukraine (Velyka Ukraina).{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}} Historically, this region is tightly entwined with the history of Ukraine and is considered the heart of the country.

[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (67,0%) and [[Russian language|Russian]] (31,9%) language are both used, with Russian being more common in cities, while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities. These details result in a significant difference across different survey results, as even a small restating of a question switches responses of a significant group of people. The speaking of [[Surzhyk]] instead of Russian or Ukrainian is wide and viewed negatively by nationalist language activists. Because it is neither the one nor the other, they regard Surzhyk as a threat to the uniqueness of [[Ukrainian culture]].

It was constructed by [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]] to control [[Cossack]]s of [[Zaporizhian Sich]], prevent [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[peasants]] from joining forces with the Cossacks and guard the southeastern corner of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Poles tried to establish order in that area, and commissioned [[France|French]] military cartographer and engineer [[William le Vasseur de Beauplan]] to construct it. The fortress cost around 100,000 Polish zlotys. The [[dragoon]] garrison was commanded by the French officer [[Jean de Marion]]. Soviet government attempted to destroy the remnants of the fortress in order to eradicate traces of Polish influences on Ukraine by setting a quarry on that site in 1944. The quarry was closed in 1994, but at that time two-thirds of the fortress had been destroyed. Today the site is just ruins, but it is a popular tourist attraction.
* [[File:AP Icon.svg]] [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Dnipro|The Saviour's Transfiguration Cathedral]] (Ukrainian: Спасо-Преображенський кафедральний собор) is the main Orthodox church of Dnipro, Ukraine.

Prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] envisioned the church as one of the spiritual centres of [[New Russia]]. [[Ivan Starov]] submitted to Potemkin his designs for a Roman-style basilica, but construction was postponed until the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War]].

{{Main|Cossack with musket}}

A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the [[Ukrainian State]]. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.

A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in 1918. However, later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine. In 2002 was adopted flag and identical coat of arms of Oblast, which consists of cossack with musket and nine yellow eight-pointed stars. Stars represent coat of arms of [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] which also consisted of imperial monogram of [[Catherine the Great]].

The official plants are [[wheat]], [[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] and [[oak]]. The motto of the oblast is [[Ad astra|Per aspera ad astra]].{{clear}}
