During the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] in the 19th century, the fortifications of Ghazni were partially demolished by [[Presidency armies|British Indian forces]].

In August 2018, the city became the site of the [[Battle of Ghazni (2018)|Battle of Ghazni]] with the Taliban briefly occupying it and taking control of most of the surrounding area.

The city was founded some time in [[ancient history|antiquity]] as a small market town. It may be the ''Gazaca'' (''Gázaca'' or ''Gāzaca'') mentioned by [[Ptolemy]],<ref name=Iranica>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Guinta |first=Roberta |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |title=GAZNÈ (or GÚazna, GÚazn^n) |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v10f4/v10f431.html |access-date=January 2, 2008 |edition=Online |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |location=United States }}{{dead link |date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> although he may have conflated it and the town of [[Ganzak]] (or Gazaka) in Iran.

In the 6th century BCE, it was conquered by the [[Achaemenid]] king [[Cyrus II]] and incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. The city was subsequently incorporated into the empire of [[Alexander the Great]] in 329 BCE, and called '''Alexandria in Opiana'''.
By the 7th century CE, the area was a major center of [[Buddhism]]. In 644, the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited a city named '''Jaguda'''—which was almost certainly the contemporary name of the later Ghazni.<ref>BA Litvinsky, Zhang Guang-Da, R. Shabani Samghabadi, ''History of civilizations of Central Asia'', pg. 385</ref><ref>Hui-li, 1959, p. 188</ref>

In 683, [[Umayyad|Arab armies]] brought [[Islam]] to the region. From 680 to 870, the [[Zunbils]] were present in the area, and at times had their capital in Ghazni. [[Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar|Yaqub Saffari]] from [[Zaranj]] conquered the Zunbils in the late 9th century. The [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] reduced the formerly [[Lawik dynasty]] to tributary status. In 962, the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] slave commander of the [[Samanid Empire]], [[Alp-Tegin]], attacked the city and besieged the [[Citadel of Ghazni]] for four months, wresting the city from [[Abu Bakr Lawik]].<ref name=Volume5>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16yHq5v3QZAC&pg=PA6|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5|author=John Andrew Boyle|page=165|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|author-link=John Andrew Boyle|isbn=9780521069366|year=1968}}</ref> Around 965, Abu Bakr Lawik recaptured Ghazni from Alp-Tegin's son, [[Abu Ishaq Ibrahim of Ghazna|Abu Ishaq Ibrahim]], forcing him to flee to [[Bukhara]]. However, this was not to last long because Abu Ishaq Ibrahim shortly returned to the town with Samanid aid, and took control of the town once again. For nearly two hundred years (977–1163), the city was the dazzling capital of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]], which encompassed much of what is today Afghanistan, [[Turkmenistan]], Pakistan, Eastern Iran and [[Rajasthan]]. The Ghaznavids took Islam to India and returned with fabulous riches looted from Hindu temples. Although the city was sacked in 1151 by the [[Ghurids|Ghorid]] Ala'uddin, it became their secondary capital in 1173, and subsequently flourished once again. Between 1215 and 1221, Ghazni was ruled by the [[Khwarezmid Empire]], during which time it was destroyed by the [[Mongols|Mongol armies]] of [[Genghis Khan]]'s son [[Ögedei Khan]].<ref name ="Columbia">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0820705.html |title=Ghazni |publisher=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.

In the first decades of the 11th century, Ghazni was the most important center of [[Persian literature]]. This was the result of the cultural policy of [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud]] (reigned 998–1030), who assembled a circle of scholars, philosophers, and poets around his throne in support of his claim to royal status in [[Iran]].<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica: [https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/452843/Persian-literature/277134/The-proliferation-of-court-patronage?anchor=ref997402 Persian literature], retrieved</ref>

The noted [[Morocco|Moroccan]] travelling scholar, [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting Ghazni in 1333, wrote:

{{Cquote|"We travelled thence to [[Parwan]], where I met the amir Buruntayh. He treated me well and wrote to his representatives at Ghazna enjoining them to show me honour.

His grave is in this city and is surmounted by a hospice. The greater part of the town is in ruins and nothing but a fraction of it remains, though it was once a large city.

Tamerlanes's grandson, [[Pir Muhammad (son of Jahangir)|Pir Muhammad bin Djinhangir]], became the governor of Ghazni (along with Kabul and Kandahar) in 1401. [[Babur]] conquered the region in 1504 and personally thought that Ghazni was "a mean place" and pondered why any of the princes of the region would make it their seat of government. Ghazni stayed under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] control until 1738 when Iranian ruler [[Nader Shah]] invaded the area. After Nader Shah's death, Ghazni became part of the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani empire]].<ref name=":0" />[[File:CH-NB - Afghanistan, Ghazni (Ghazna)- Menschen - Annemarie Schwarzenbach - SLA-Schwarzenbach-A-5-21-155.jpg|thumb|View of Ghazni Citadel, 1939]]

Ghazni City is famous for its [[Ghazni Minarets]] built on a stellar plan. They date from the middle of the twelfth century and are the surviving elements of the [[mosque]] of Bahramshah. Their sides are decorated with intricate geometric patterns. Some of the upper sections of the minarets have been damaged or destroyed. The most important [[mausoleum]] located in Ghazni City is that of [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud]]. Others include the Tombs of poets and scientists, such as the Tomb of [[Al Biruni]]. The only ruins in Old Ghazni retaining a semblance of architectural form are two towers, about 43&nbsp;m (140&nbsp;ft) high and 365&nbsp;m (1,200&nbsp;ft) apart. According to inscriptions, the towers were constructed by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and his son. For more than eight centuries the “Towers of Victory” monuments to Afghanistan's greatest empire have survived wars and invasions, the two toffee-colored minarets, adorned with terra-cotta tiles were raised in the early 12th century as monuments to the victories of the Afghan armies that built the empire. By the time the Ghurids had finalized the Ghaznavid removal from Ghazni, the city was a cultural center of the eastern Islamic world.<ref>C.E. Bosworth, ''The Later Ghaznavids'', (Columbia University Press, 1977), 115.</ref>

[[File:Lincoln Learning Center in Ghazni.jpg|thumb|U.S. Deputy Ambassador to Afghanistan [[Earl Anthony Wayne|Anthony Wayne]] and Ghazni's Governor [[Musa Khan Ahmadzai]] are talking to students who use Afghanistan's newest [[Lincoln Learning Center]]]]

During the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], the city was captured by British forces on 23 July 1839 in the [[Battle of Ghazni]]. The [[Afghan Civil War (1992-1996)|Civil war in Afghanistan]] and the continued conflict between the [[Taliban]] and the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] during the 1990s put the relics of Ghazni in jeopardy. Ghazni's strategic position, both economically and militarily, assured its revival, albeit without its dazzling former grandeur. Through the centuries the city has figured prominently as the all-important key to the possession of [[Kabul]].

After the 2001 [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[United States armed forces]] built a [[Forward Operating Base Ghazni|base in Ghazni]]. They have been involved in rebuilding projects and protecting the local population against [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban insurgents]].

Dozens of [[airstrikes]] were carried out in support of Afghan police and government forces and hundreds of Afghan soldiers, police, and Taliban insurgents were killed as well as dozens of civilians. In addition to the destruction and human suffering caused by the fighting, the Taliban also set fire to many buildings in the city.

== Geography ==

=== Land Use ===
Ghazni is a trading and transit hub in central Afghanistan. Agriculture is the dominant land use at 28%.<ref name="auto1">{{cite book|url=http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|title=The State of Afghan Cities Report 2015|ref=UN-Habitat|access-date=20 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031111658/http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|archive-date=31 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In terms of built-up land area, vacant plots (33%) slightly outweigh residential area (31%).<ref name="auto1" /> Districts 3 and 4 also have large institutional areas. The city has four police districts (''nahia'') and covers a total land area of 3,330 hectares.<ref name="auto1" /> The total number of dwellings in Ghazni city is 15,931.<ref name="auto1" />

=== Climate ===
Ghazni's climate is transitional between a [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk'') and a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] (''Dsa''). It has cold, snowy winters and warm, dry summers. Precipitation is low and mostly falls in winter (as snow) and spring (as rain). Winters are very cold, with a subzero January daily average temperature of {{convert|−5.9|°C|1}}, mainly due to the high elevation of the city.
