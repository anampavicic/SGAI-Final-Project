'''Mainz''' ({{IPA|de|maɪnts|lang|De-Mainz.ogg}}; [[#Alternative names|see below]]) is the capital and largest city of the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and with around 223,000 inhabitants,<ref name=pop>{{cite web|url=https://www.mainz.de/medien/internet/downloads/statistik/Einwohner_nach_Stadtteilen_am_31_12_2023.pdf |title=Einwohner der Landeshauptstadt Mainz laut Melderegister am 31.12.2023 (zum Stichtag erstellt am 15.02.2024)|publisher=Landeshauptstadt Mainz|access-date=2024-07-23}}</ref> it is [[List of cities in Germany by population|Germany's 35th-largest city]]. It lies in the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region]]—Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after [[Rhine-Ruhr]]—which also encompasses the cities of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach am Main]], and [[Hanau]].

Mainz is located at the northern end of the [[Upper Rhine Plain]], on the left bank of the [[Rhine]], opposite the [[Hesse|Hessian]] capital of [[Wiesbaden]] and the mouth of the [[River Main]] into the Rhine. It is the largest city of [[Rhenish Hesse]], a region of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] that was historically part of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], and is [[Rheinhessen (wine region)|one of Germany's most important wine regions]] because of its mild climate. Mainz is connected to [[Frankfurt am Main]] by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]] rapid transit system. Before 1945, Mainz had six boroughs on the other side of the Rhine (see: [[:de:Rechtsrheinische Stadtteile von Mainz]]). Three have been incorporated into [[Wiesbaden]] (see: [[:de:AKK-Konflikt]]), and three are now independent.

Mainz was founded as [[Castrum]] ''Mogontiacum'' by [[Roman people|Roman]] general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] in the 1st century BC on the northern frontier of the [[Roman Empire]],  and became the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Superior]]. The city was settled by the [[Franks]] from 459 on, and in the 8th century it became an important city within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], as capital of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] and seat of the [[Elector of Mainz|Archbishop-Elector of Mainz]], the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of Germany. [[Mainz Cathedral]] is one of the three Rhenish [[Imperial Cathedrals]] along with [[Speyer Cathedral]] and [[Worms Cathedral]].

Since the 12th century, Mainz was one of the {{Ill|ShUM-cities|de|SchUM-Städte}}—a league formed by the cities of [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and Mainz—which are referred to as the cradle of [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] life and as the center of Jewish life during Medieval times. The Jewish heritage of these cities is one of a kind, and has been declared the UNESCO World Heritage Site of {{Ill|ShUM Sites of Speyer, Worms and Mainz|de|SchUM-Stätten von Speyer, Worms und Mainz|quote=y}},<ref name="Centre">{{Cite web |last=Centre |first=UNESCO World Heritage |title=ShUM Sites of Speyer, Worms and Mainz |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1636/ |access-date=14 April 2022 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en |archive-date=22 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822022640/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1636/ |url-status=live }}</ref> which includes the {{Ill|Judensand|de|Judensand}} (Jews' Sand), the second-oldest Jewish cemetery in Europe after the [[Jewish Cemetery, Worms|Heiliger Sand]] in Worms.

Mainz is the birthplace of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], who introduced letterpress [[printing]] to Europe with his [[movable type]] [[printing press]], [[Global spread of the printing press|starting the global spread of the printing press]], and in the early 1450s manufactured his first books in the city, including the [[Gutenberg Bible]]s, two of which are kept at the city's [[Gutenberg Museum]]. Mainz was heavily damaged in [[World War II]]; more than [[Bombing of Mainz in World War II|30 air raids]] destroyed around half of the old town in the city centre, but many buildings were rebuilt post-war.

Like most cities in the [[Rhineland]], Mainz holds [[Mainz carnival|extensive carnival celebrations]], that are known as the second-most important in Germany, after the [[Cologne Carnival|celebrations in Cologne]]. The borough of Lerchenberg is the seat of [[ZDF]] (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, {{lit.}} "Second German Television"), the second-most important German public service television broadcaster, as well as of [[3sat]], another television broadcaster, that is jointly operated by public broadcasters from Germany ([[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]]), Austria ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]), and Switzerland ([[SRG SSR]]).

==History==<!--[[Port of Mainz]] section redirects here-->
{{see also|Timeline of Mainz}}

===Roman Mogontiacum===
[[File:Stadttor1.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of a Roman town gate from the late 4th century]]
The Roman stronghold or ''[[castrum]] '''Mogontiacum''''', the precursor to Mainz, was founded by the Roman general [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] perhaps as early as 13/12 BC. As related by [[Suetonius]] the existence of ''Mogontiacum'' is well established by four years later (the account of the death and funeral of [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]).<!--{{efn|The earliest certain evidence of the existence of ''Mogontiacum'' is the account of the death and funeral of [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], brother of the future emperor, [[Tiberius]], given in [[Suetonius]]' life of Drusus. Few leaders have been as loved and as popular as Drusus. He fell from his horse in 9 BC, contracted gangrene and lingered for several days. His brother Tiberius reached him in just a few days riding post-horses over the Roman roads and served as the chief mourner, walking with the deceased in a funeral procession from the summer camp where he had fallen to Mogontiacum, where the soldiers insisted on a funeral. The body was transported to Rome, cremated in the [[Campus Martius]] and the ashes placed in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], who was still alive, and wrote poetry and delivered a state funeral oration for him. If Drusus founded Mogontiacum the earliest date is the start of his campaign, 13 BC. Some hypothesize that Mogontiacum was constructed at one of two earlier opportunities, one when [[Marcus Agrippa]] campaigned in the region in 42 BC or by [[Julius Caesar]] himself after 58 BC. Lack of evidence plays a part in favouring 13 BC. No sources cite Mogontiacum before 13 BC, no legions are known to have been stationed there, and no coins survive.{{Cite quote|intermediate source needs cited |date=August 2010}}}}--> Although the city is situated opposite the mouth of the [[Main (river)|Main]], the name of Mainz is not from ''Main'', the similarity being perhaps reinforced by [[Folk etymology|folk-etymological]] reanalysis. ''Main'' is from Latin ''Moenis'' (also ''Moenus'' or ''Menus''), the name the Romans used for the river. [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] analysis of the many forms that the name "Mainz" has taken on make it clear that it is a simplification of ''Mogontiacum''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Roman Germany: a guide to sites and museums |first=Joachim |last=von Elbe |location=Mainz |publisher=P. von Zabern |year=1975 |page=253}}</ref> The name appears to be [[Celtic languages|Celtic]],<ref name="Spektrum der Wissenschaft-2011">{{cite web |title=Namenskunde: Den Kelten auf der Spur |website=Spektrum der Wissenschaft |date=13 January 2011 |url=https://www.spektrum.de/news/den-kelten-auf-der-spur/1060167 |language=de |access-date=30 January 2023 |archive-date=30 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230130222451/https://www.spektrum.de/news/den-kelten-auf-der-spur/1060167 |url-status=live }}</ref> however, it had also become Roman and was selected by them with a special significance.<ref name="Spektrum der Wissenschaft-2011" /> The Roman soldiers defending [[Gallia]] had adopted the Gallic god [[Mogons]] (Mogounus, Moguns, Mogonino), for the meaning of which etymology offers two basic options: "the great one", similar to Latin magnus, which was used in aggrandizing names such as ''Alexander magnus'', "Alexander the Great" and ''Pompeius magnus'', "Pompey the great", or the god of "might" personified as it appears in young servitors of any type whether of noble or ignoble birth.<ref>A second hypothesis suggests that Moguns was a wealthy Celt whose estate was taken for the fort and that a tax district was formed on the area parallel to other tax districts with a -iacum suffix (Arenacum, Mannaricium). There is no evidence for this supposedly wealthy man or his estate, but there is plenty for the god. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] in ''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin'', -yo- and -k- are general Indo-European formative suffices and are not related to taxes. As the loyalty of the [[Vangiones]] was unquestioned and Drusus was campaigning over the Rhine, it is unlikely Mogontiacum would have been built to collect taxes from the Vangiones, who were not a Roman ''municipium''.</ref>

The castrum was the base of [[Legio XIV Gemina|Legio XIV ''Gemina'']] and [[Legio XVI Gallica|XVI ''Gallica'']] (AD 9–43), [[Legio XXII Primigenia|XXII ''Primigenia'']], [[Legio IV Macedonica|IV ''Macedonica'']] (43–70), [[Legio I Adiutrix|I ''Adiutrix'']] (70–88), [[Legio XXI Rapax|XXI ''Rapax'']] (70–89), and [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV ''Gemina'']] (70–92), among others. Mainz was also a base of a Roman river fleet, the [[Classis Germanica]]. Remains of Roman troop ships ([[navis lusoria]]) and a patrol boat from the late 4th century were discovered in 1982/86 and may now be viewed in the ''Museum für Antike Schifffahrt''.

The city was the provincial capital of [[Germania Superior]], and had an important funeral monument dedicated to Drusus, to which people made pilgrimages for an annual festival from as far away as [[Lyon]]. Among the famous buildings were the largest [[Roman Theatre (Mainz)|theatre]] north of the Alps and a bridge across the Rhine.

Throughout the changes of time, the Roman castrum never seems to have been permanently abandoned as a military installation, which is a testimony to Roman military judgement. Different structures were built there at different times. The current citadel originated in 1660, but it replaced previous forts. It was used in World War II. One of the sights at the citadel is still the [[cenotaph]] raised by legionaries to commemorate their general, [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus|Drusus]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Dumont |first=Stefan |title=Drususstein |website=Festung Mainz |url=http://www.festung-mainz.de/zitadelle/rundgang/drususstein.html |language=de |access-date=30 January 2023 |archive-date=30 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230130222834/http://www.festung-mainz.de/zitadelle/rundgang/drususstein.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Notably, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz is unique as it is the only diocese in the world with an episcopal see called a [[Holy See]] (sancta sedes). 

[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]], a 10th-century Hispano-Arabic, [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] traveler, writes the following about the city: <blockquote>''"Mainz [Maghānja] is a very large city, partly inhabited and partly cultivated fields.

The city of Mainz responded to the Jewish population in a variety of ways, behaving in a capricious manner towards them.

Outside of the medieval city centre, there is a Jewish cemetery, with over 1500 headstones dating from the 11th through the 19th centuries.<ref name="Ministry for Science, Further Education and Culture Rhineland-Palatinate-2020" /> The earliest known gravestone is date to 1062 or 1063, and these early gravestones resemble those found in Italy in the 8th–9th centuries.<ref name="Ministry for Science, Further Education and Culture Rhineland-Palatinate-2020" />

===Republic of Mainz===
{{Main|Republic of Mainz}}

During the [[French Revolution]], the French Revolutionary army occupied Mainz in 1792; the Archbishop-elector of Mainz, [[Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal]], had already fled to [[Aschaffenburg]] by the time the French marched in. On 18 March 1793, the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] of Mainz, with other German democrats from about 130 towns in the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]], proclaimed the '[[Republic of Mainz]]'. Led by [[Georg Forster]], representatives of the Mainz Republic in Paris requested political affiliation of the Mainz Republic with France, but too late: [[Prussia]] was not entirely happy with the idea of a democratic free state on German soil (although the French dominated Mainz was neither free nor democratic). Prussian troops had already occupied the area and besieged Mainz by the end of March 1793. After a [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|siege]] of 18 weeks, the French troops in Mainz surrendered on 23 July 1793; Prussians occupied the city and ended the Republic of Mainz. It came to the [[Battle of Mainz]] in 1795 between [[Habsburg monarchy|Austria]] and France. Members of the Mainz Jacobin Club were mistreated or imprisoned and punished for treason.<ref name="Dumont-2013">{{cite book |last1=Dumont |first1=Franz |last2=Dumont |first2=Stefan |title=Die Mainzer Republik 1792/93 französischer Revolutionsexport und deutscher Demokratieversuch |publication-place=Mainz |date=2013 |isbn=978-3-9811001-3-6 |oclc=846966137 |language=de |page=60}}</ref>

In 1797, the French returned. The army of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] occupied the German territory to the west of the [[Rhine]], and the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] awarded France this entire area, initially as the [[Cisrhenian Republic]]. On 17 February 1800, the French ''[[Mont-Tonnerre|Département du Mont-Tonnerre]]'' was founded here, with Mainz as its capital, the Rhine being the new eastern frontier of la Grande Nation.

===Rhenish Hesse===
In 1816, the part of the former French Département which is known today as [[Rhenish Hesse]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Rheinhessen}}) was awarded to the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]], Mainz being the capital of the new [[Hesse|Hessian]] province of Rhenish Hesse. From 1816 to 1866, a part of the [[German Confederation]], Mainz was the most important fortress in the defence against France, and had a strong garrison of [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], Prussian and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]n troops.<ref name="Dumont-2018">{{cite journal |last=Dumont |first=Stefan |title=Soldaten und Mainzerinnen in der Festung Mainz 1816‒1866 |journal=Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz |year=2018 |doi=10.25358/OPENSCIENCE-4435 |url=https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4437 |language=de |access-date=31 January 2023 |page= |archive-date=31 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131070854/https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4437 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Industrial expansion===
[[File:Mainz BlickzumRhein 1890.jpg|thumb|Mainz towards the Rhine (around 1890)]]
For centuries the inhabitants of the [[Fortress Mainz|fortress of Mainz]] had suffered from a severe shortage of space which led to disease and other inconveniences. In 1872 Mayor [[Carl Wallau]] and the council of Mainz persuaded the military government to sign a contract to expand the city. Beginning in 1874, the city of Mainz assimilated the ''Gartenfeld'', an idyllic area of meadows and fields along the banks of the [[Rhine]] to the north of the rampart.<ref name="regionalgeschichte.net-4">{{cite web |title=Mainz im letzten Viertel des 19.

During the [[German Revolution of 1918]] the [[Mainz Workers' and Soldiers' Council]] was formed which ran the city from 9 November until the arrival of French troops under the terms of the [[occupation of the Rhineland]] agreed in the [[Armistice]]. The French occupation was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] which went into effect 28 June 1919. The [[Rhineland]] (in which Mainz is located) was to be a demilitarized zone until 1935 and the French garrison, representing the ''[[Triple Entente]]'', was to stay until reparations were paid.<ref name="Portal Rheinische Geschichte-2">{{cite web |title=Die Rheinlandbesetzung (1918–1930) |website=Portal Rheinische Geschichte |url=https://www.rheinische-geschichte.lvr.de/Epochen-und-Themen/Themen/die-rheinlandbesetzung-1918-1930/DE-2086/lido/57d133f17e43d1.98845861 |language=de |access-date=31 January 2023 |archive-date=31 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131122935/https://www.rheinische-geschichte.lvr.de/Epochen-und-Themen/Themen/die-rheinlandbesetzung-1918-1930/DE-2086/lido/57d133f17e43d1.98845861 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Architecture===
The destruction caused by the [[Bombing of Mainz in World War II]] led to the most intense phase of building in the history of the town. During the last war in Germany, more than 30 air raids destroyed about 80 per cent of the city's centre, including most of the historic buildings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mainz Cathedral (Mainzer Dom) |url=http://sacred-destinations.com/germany/mainz-cathedral.htm |access-date=14 February 2009 |website=www.sacred-destinations.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214113133/http://sacred-destinations.com/germany/mainz-cathedral.htm |archive-date=14 February 2009}}</ref> The attack on the afternoon of 27 February 1945 remains the most destructive of all 33 bombings that Mainz has suffered in World War II in the collective memory of most of the population living then.

Nevertheless, the post-war reconstruction took place very slowly. While cities such as Frankfurt had been rebuilt fast by a central authority, only individual efforts were initially successful in rebuilding Mainz. The reason for this was that the French wanted Mainz to expand and become a model city. Mainz lay within the [[Allied-occupied Germany|French-controlled sector of Germany]] and it was a French architect and town-planner, [[Marcel Lods]], who produced a Le Corbusier-style plan of an ideal architecture.<ref>Eric Paul Mumford: ''[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] Discourse on Urbanism 1928–1960'' p. 159</ref><ref>Jeffry M.

Even after the failure of the model city plans it was the initiative of the French (founding of the Johannes Gutenberg [[University of Mainz]], elevation of Mainz to the state capital of Rhineland-Palatinate, the early resumption of the [[Mainz carnival]]) driving the city in a positive development after the war. The City Plan of 1958 by [[Ernst May]] allowed a regulated reconstruction for the first time. In 1950, the seat of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate had been transferred to the new Mainz and in 1963 the seat of the new ZDF, notable architects were Adolf Bayer, Richard Jörg and Egon Hartmann. At the time of the two-thousand-years-anniversary in 1962 the city was largely reconstructed. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Oberstadt had been extended, Münchfeld and Lerchenberg added as suburbs, the Altstadttangente ([[Automobile dependency|intersection of the old town]]), new neighbourhoods as Westring and Südring contributed to the extension. By 1970 there remained only a few ruins. The new town hall of Mainz had been designed by [[Arne Jacobsen]] and finished by [[Dissing+Weitling]].<ref name="BAUWELT-2022">{{cite web |title=Mainz – Das moderne Monument |website=BAUWELT |date=21 September 2022 |url=https://www.bauwelt.de/themen/bauten/Mainz-Das-moderne-Monument-2153247.html |language=de |access-date=31 January 2023 |archive-date=31 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131131539/https://www.bauwelt.de/themen/bauten/Mainz-Das-moderne-Monument-2153247.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The town used Jacobsens activity for the Danish [[Novo Nordisk|Novo]] company<ref name="Informationsdienst Wissenschaft – Nachrichten-2008">{{cite web |title=Novo Nordisk feiert 50-jähriges Jubiläum in Deutschland – Dänisches Pharmaunternehmen ist nicht nur mit Insulinen erfolgreich |website=Informationsdienst Wissenschaft – Nachrichten |date=6 February 2008 |url=https://idw-online.de/de/news245871 |language=de |access-date=31 January 2023 |archive-date=31 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131131958/https://idw-online.de/de/news245871 |url-status=live }}</ref> erecting a new office and warehouse building to contact him.

==Culture==
Mainz is home to a [[Carnival]], the ''Mainzer Fassenacht'' or ''Fastnacht'', which has developed since the early 19th century. Carnival in Mainz has its roots in the criticism of social and political injustices under the shelter of cap and bells. Today, the uniforms of many traditional Carnival clubs still imitate and caricature the uniforms of the French and Prussian troops of the past. The height of the carnival season is on [[Rosenmontag]] ("rose Monday"), when there is a large parade in Mainz, with more than 500,000 people celebrating in the streets.<ref name="Kirschstein-2018">{{cite web |last=Kirschstein |first=Gisela |title=Phantastischer Rosenmontag in Mainz – Mehr als 500.000 feiern friedlich große Narrenparty, Rosenmontagszug rollt störungsfrei |website=Mainz& |date=12 February 2018 |url=https://mainzund.de/phantastischer-rosenmontag-in-mainz-mehr-als-500-000-feiern-friedlich-grosse-narrenparty-rosenmontagszug-rollt-stoerungsfrei/ |access-date=31 January 2023 |archive-date=31 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131134431/https://mainzund.de/phantastischer-rosenmontag-in-mainz-mehr-als-500-000-feiern-friedlich-grosse-narrenparty-rosenmontagszug-rollt-stoerungsfrei/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Frankfurter Rundschau-2020">{{cite web |title=Nahezu 500.000 Zuschauer |website=[[Frankfurter Rundschau]] |date=24 February 2020 |url=https://www.fr.de/rhein-main/hochtaunus/nahezu-500000-zuschauer-13557187.html |language=de |access-date=31 January 2023 |archive-date=31 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131134438/https://www.fr.de/rhein-main/hochtaunus/nahezu-500000-zuschauer-13557187.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
