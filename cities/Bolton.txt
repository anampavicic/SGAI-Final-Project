'''Bolton''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Bolton.ogg|ˈ|b|oʊ|l|t|ən}} {{respell|BOHL|tən}}, locally {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|t|ən}} {{respell|BOH|tən}}){{sfnp|Shorrocks|1999|pp=10|ps=none}} is a town in [[Greater Manchester]] in England. In the foothills of the [[West Pennine Moors]], Bolton is between [[Manchester]], [[Blackburn]], [[Wigan]], [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] and [[Salford]]. It is surrounded by several towns and villages that form the wider [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|borough]], of which Bolton is the [[administrative centre]]. The town is within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] boundaries of [[Lancashire]].

A former [[mill town]], Bolton has been a centre for textile production since the 14th century when [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers settled in the area, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. It was a 19th-century [[boomtown]], development largely coincided with the introduction of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]. At its peak in 1929, its 216&nbsp;[[cotton mill]]s and 26&nbsp;bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the [[First World War]] and, by the 1980s, cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in the town.

The town has a population of 139,403, whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400. Bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as [[Bolton le Moors]]. In the [[English Civil War]], the town was a [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] outpost in 1644 in a staunchly [[Cavalier|Royalist]] region and, as a result, the Royalist [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] led ''[[Storming of Bolton|the 1644 storming of Bolton]]'' of 3,000&nbsp;Royalist troops  in which is also referred to as ''The Bolton Massacre'', with 1,600&nbsp;residents perished and 700 were taken prisoner.

[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] football club now play home games at the [[University of Bolton Stadium]] in [[Horwich]]. Cultural interests include the [[Octagon Theatre, Bolton|Octagon Theatre]] and the [[Bolton Museum]] and Art Gallery, as well as one of the earliest public libraries established after the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]].

In 1067 [[Great Bolton]] was the property of [[Roger de Poitou]] and after 1100, of Roger de Meresheys. Bolton became the property of the [[Pilkington of Lancashire|Pilkington]] family until they forfeited the land in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The land was given to the [[Stanley family]] and thus the [[Earls of Derby]] who became royalists in the [[English Civil War]].

===Industrial Revolution onward===
[[File:Swan Lane Mills Bolton - geograph.org.uk - 175112.jpg|thumb|left|[[Swan Lane Mills]]]]
Bolton was a 19th-century [[boomtown]] and, at its zenith in 1929, its 216&nbsp;[[cotton mill]]s and 26&nbsp;bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War and, by the 1980s, cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton.

A tradition of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, [[Richard Arkwright]] and [[Samuel Crompton]], led to rapid growth of the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at [[Hall i' th' Wood]], invented the [[spinning mule]] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding [[moorland]] into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the [[bleach]] works that were a feature of this area.{{sfnp|Ashmore|1982|p=81|ps=none}} Bleaching using [[chlorine]] was introduced in the 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the [[Lever Bank Bleach Works]] in the Irwell Valley.<ref name="SpWeb"/> The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of [[James Hargreaves]]'s [[spinning jenny]], producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn.<ref name="SpWeb">{{cite web |title=Bolton |url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=48&sub=nwcotton&theme=places&crumb=Bolton |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003071713/http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=48&sub=nwcotton&theme=places&crumb=Bolton |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 October 2006 |publisher=spinningtheweb.org.uk |access-date=6 December 2009 |mode=cs2}}</ref> The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at [[Barrow Bridge]], but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.<ref name=lewis1835/>

Growth of the textile industry was assisted by the availability of coal in the area. By 1896 John Fletcher had coal mines at [[Ladyshore Colliery|Ladyshore]] in [[Little Lever]]; The Earl of Bradford had a coal mine at [[Great Lever]]; the Darcy Lever Coal Company had mines at [[Darcy Lever]] and there were coal mines at [[Tonge, Bolton|Tonge]], [[Breightmet]], [[Deane, Greater Manchester|Deane]] and [[Doffcocker]]. Some of these pits were close to the [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal]] providing the owners with markets in Bolton and Manchester.<ref name="1896 coal mines list">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdmhs.com/1896%20Lists/1896-80.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006230321/http://www.pdmhs.com/1896%20Lists/1896-80.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 October 2007 |title=1896 coal mines list |publisher=pdmhs.com |access-date=6 December 2009 |mode=cs2}}</ref> Coal mining declined in the 20th century.

Important transport links contributed to the growth of the town and the textile industry; the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal<ref name=lewis1835/> constructed in 1791, connected the town to [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] and [[Manchester]] providing transport for coal and other basic materials. The [[Bolton and Leigh Railway]], the oldest in Lancashire, opened to goods traffic in 1828 and [[Bolton Great Moor Street railway station|Great Moor Street station]] opened to passengers in 1831. The railway initially connected Bolton to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] in [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], an important link with the [[port of Liverpool]] for the import of raw [[cotton]] from America, but was extended in 1829 to link up with the [[Manchester to Liverpool Line]].<ref name=lewis1835/> Local firms built locomotives for the railway, in 1830 "Union" was built by [[Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell|Rothwell, Hick and Company]] and two locomotives, "Salamander" and "Veteran" were built by Crook and Dean.{{sfnp|Sweeney|1996|p=8|ps=none}}

Bolton's first Mayor, Charles James Darbishire was sympathetic to [[Chartism]] and a supporter of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]]. In August 1839 Bolton was besieged by Chartist rioters and the [[Riot Act]] was read and special constables sworn in. The mayor accompanied soldiers called to rescue special constables at [[Little Bolton Town Hall]], which was besieged by a mob, and the incident ended without bloodshed.<ref name="First Mayor">{{cite web |url=http://www.boltonsmayors.org.uk/darbishire-c-j.html |title=Charles Darbishire |publisher=boltonsmayors.org.uk |access-date=31 May 2010 |mode=cs2 |archive-date=21 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121080401/http://www.boltonsmayors.org.uk/darbishire-c-j.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Derby Barracks, Bolton|Derby Barracks]] was established in Fletcher Street in the early 1860s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bolton.gov.uk/sites/DocumentCentre/Documents/Urban%20Historic%20Landscape%20Characterisation.pdf |title=Bolton Urban Historic Landscape Characterisation |page=150 |publisher=University of Manchester |access-date=19 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920045115/http://www.bolton.gov.uk/sites/DocumentCentre/Documents/Urban%20Historic%20Landscape%20Characterisation.pdf |archive-date=20 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Lord Leverhulme===
In 1899 William Lever, [[William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme|Lord Leverhulme]], bought Hall i'th' Wood as a memorial to Samuel Crompton inventor of the spinning mule. Lever restored the dilapidated building and presented it to the town in 1902, having turned it into a museum furnished with household goods typical of domestic family life in the 16th and 17th centuries. Lever re-endowed [[Bolton School]]s, giving land and his house on Chorley New Road.

The Great Hall of [[Smithills Hall]] was built in the 14th century when William de Radcliffe received the Manor of Smithills from the Hultons, the chapel dates from the 16th century and was extended during the 19th. Smithills Hall was where, in 1555, [[George Marsh (martyr)|George Marsh]] was tried for heresy during the [[Marian Persecutions]]. After being "examined" at Smithills, according to local tradition, George Marsh stamped his foot so hard to re-affirm his faith, that a footprint was left in the stone floor.
