'''Pathein''' ({{MYname|MY=ပုသိမ်မြို့|MLCTS=pu. sim mrui.}}, {{IPA-my|pəθèɪ̯ɰ̃ mjo̰}}; {{langx|mnw|ဖာသီ}}, {{IPA-mnw|pʰasɛm|}}), formerly called '''Bassein''', is the largest city and the capital of the [[Ayeyarwady Region]], [[Burma|Myanmar (Burma)]].  It is located 190&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;mi) west of [[Yangon]] within [[Pathein Township]] on the bank of the [[Pathein River]] (Pathein), which is a western branch of the [[Irrawaddy River]],<ref name="EB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/55491/Pathein|title=Pathein|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=August 21, 2009}}</ref> the city had a population of 172,923 in 2019. Although once a part of the [[Mon kingdoms]], Pathein has few ethnic [[Mon people|Mon]] residents today. The majority are of [[Bamar]] with a significant [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Burmese Indian]], [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] and [[Burmese Chinese]] populations .

==Etymology==
The city's name is believed to derive from the [[Mon people|Old Mon]] name, {{my|ဖာသီ}} ({{IPA|[pha sɛm]}}).<ref>''Dictionary of Modern Spoken Mon'' by H.L. Shorto (1962, Oxford University Press)</ref> "pha" means great or wide and sī/sɛm means river or sea. Pha-sɛm means a big sea. The name was corrupted to ''Bassein'' during the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial period]].

An alternate theory holds that the city's name comes from the classical name of Pathein, Kusimanagara, a name used by ancient writings and the [[Kalyani Inscriptions|Kalyani inscriptions]]. Pathein itself is a corruption of [[Mon language|Mon]] "Kuthen," which itself is a contraction of Kusima or Kusimanagara, a [[Pali]] name for the city.<ref name="gray">{{cite book|title=Buddhaghosuppatti|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279735|editor=James Gray|publisher=Luzac & Company|location=London|date=1892|pages=11}}</ref><ref name="hornig"/> This is supported by the fact that the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] call Pathein "Cosmim."<ref name="gray"/>

Another theory is that modern name Pathein potentially derives from this time period based on the word Patkain, a version of the archaic Burmese word for [[Muslims]] ''pathi'' ({{langx|my|ပသီ}}), based on either the growing presence of Arab traders in Pathein during the 16th century or on a purported Muslim Indian who ruled the city around 1233 CE.<ref name="hornig"/><ref name="mimu"/>

==History==
[[File:Bassein, late 1800s.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's rendition of the Bassein shoreline in 1878.|alt=]]
According to local history, the city was first a town called Thinsawanargara ({{langx|my|သဉ္စဝနာဂရ}}) was founded in 325 BCE by a King "Sri Dhammasoka".<ref name="mimu"/> The first extant record of a settlement in the location called '''Kusima''' in the [[Pali language]] comes from a Sri Lankan rock inscription dated to 1165 CE. It is often mentioned that the city was part of Buddhist [[Mon kingdoms]] prior to the expansion of the [[Bagan Empire]], however detailed research into the city's history is not extensive.<ref name="hornig">{{cite book |title=On Money and Metta: Economy and Morality in Urban Buddhist Myanmar |last=Hornig |first=Laura |year=2020 |publisher= LIT Verlag |location=Münster |isbn=9783643963406 |pages=19–20}}</ref>

Pathein was raided in 1180 CE by [[Parakramabahu I]] of the [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa]] in modern-day Sri Lanka, as attested by the Devanagala Rock inscription during the [[Polonnaruwa-Pagan War]].<ref>{{cite journal |title= Buddhist Connections in the Indian Ocean: Changes in Monastic Mobility, 1000-1500 |last=Blackburn |first=Anne |date=6 July 2015 |journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=237–266 |doi=10.1163/15685209-12341374 |url=https://brill.com/view/journals/jesh/58/3/article-p237_1.xml?language=en |access-date=23 October 2023}}</ref> The raid was retaliatroy against diplomatic incidents and hostility by [[Narapatisithu|Sithu II]] of [[Bagan Kingdom|Bagan]], implying that Pathein was under Bagan rule by this time.<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|author-link= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

However, various historians disagree on the extent of the empire and his military campaigns.<ref>{{cite book | author=Kyaw Thet | author-link=Kyaw Thet | title= History of Burma | year= 1962| publisher=Yangon University Press |location= Yangon | language=my |pages=41–42}}</ref> The latest date that Pathein could have become part of the Bagan empire is in 1265 CE where we have the oldest Burmese record of the city's existence.<ref name="hornig"/>

Until the 15th century, most of Lower Burma was largely jungle and swamp land with little development. Burmese ports like Pathein were known by traders as early as the 10th or 11th century. However, it was only in the 14th century during the rise of the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], a Mon kingdom based on [[Bago, Myanmar|Pegu]] that brought Lower Burma to prominence as a trading hub.<ref name="hornig"/>

In 1852, the [[British Raj|British]] established a [[fort]] and [[garrison]] in the city after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. The city grew during the colonial period as the terminus of a railroad line, becoming a rice-milling and export center as a port accessible to large vehicles.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Bassein |encyclopedia=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia |date=2022 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Bassein |access-date=23 October 2023}}</ref>

==Geography and economy==

[[File:Burma 170.JPG|thumb|left|Locally made parasols]]
Lying at the western edge of the [[Ayeyarwady River]] delta, on the Pathein (Ngawan) River {{convert|118|mi|km}} west of [[Yangon]], Pathein is accessible to large vessels and despite its distance from the [[ocean]], it is the most important delta port outside of Yangon. The city is also a terminus of a branch of the main [[railroad]] line which connects it to [[Hinthada]], [[Letpadan]] and Yangon. In the 1990s, the road network along the Irrawaddy to [[Monywa]] was improved.<ref name="EB"/>

The coastline along the [[Bay of Bengal]] is surrounded by the [[Arakan Mountains]]. In the area is [[Inye Lake]], {{convert|1.5|mi}} long and {{convert|1|mi}} wide, which is known for its fishing. There is also an offshore reef at [[Diamond Island (Myanmar)|Diamond Island]] that is popular with bathers. Diamond Island is also noted as a [[turtle]] breeding ground.<ref name="EB"/>

The city is a [[rice]]-milling and export centre. Aside from several rice mills, the town has numerous sawmills and [[umbrella]] workshops. The colourful handmade parasols made in Pathein are widely known throughout Burma.<ref name="EB"/> They are known locally as "[[Hti|Pathein hti]]".<ref name="Journey">{{Cite web|url=http://www.journeysmyanmar.com/highlights_of_myanmar_pathein.htm|title=Pathein (Bassein)|publisher=Journeysmyanmar.com|access-date=August 21, 2009}}</ref> Pathein is also known for its pottery and colourful hand-made baskets and buckets. Among Pathein's most prominent industries also include production of [[salt]], [[mat]]s, and [[Pathein halawa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myanmar.mmtimes.com/timeout/12379-2014-10-29-10-08-56.html|title=မြို့သမိုင်းကြောင်းစာအုပ် ရှာပုံတော်ဖွင့်ရာ အောင်မြင်မှု မရခဲ့တဲ့ ပုသိမ်|date=2014-10-29|website=The Myanmar Times|language=my|access-date=2019-11-15|archive-date=2019-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115065946/https://myanmar.mmtimes.com/timeout/12379-2014-10-29-10-08-56.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[textiles]] produced in Pathein Industrial Zone is, however, the largest industry economy of the city.
