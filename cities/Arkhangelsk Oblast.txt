'''Arkhangelsk Oblast''' ({{lang-rus|Архангельская область|p=ɐrˈxanɡʲɪlʲskəjə ˈobɫəsʲtʲ}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). It includes the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] archipelagos of [[Franz Josef Land]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]], as well as the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]]. Arkhangelsk Oblast also has administrative jurisdiction over the [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] (NAO). Including the NAO, Arkhangelsk Oblast has an area of {{convert|587,400|km2}}, it's the largest of [[List of first-level administrative divisions by area|first-level administrative divisions]] in Europe. Its population (including the NAO) was 1,227,626 as of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]].<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>

Among the oldest populated places of the oblast are [[Kholmogory, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Kholmogory]], [[Kargopol]], and [[Solvychegodsk]]; there are a number of Russian Orthodox monasteries, including the [[Antoniev Siysky Monastery]] and the [[World Heritage Site]] of the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]].

[[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] is one of three [[spaceport]]s in Russia (the other two are [[Kapustin Yar]] in [[Astrakhan Oblast]] and [[Dombarovsky (air base)|Yasny]]  in [[Orenburg Oblast]]).

==Geography==
Arkhangelsk Oblast, which includes the [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]], borders [[Kirov Oblast]], [[Vologda Oblast]], the [[Republic of Karelia]], the [[Komi Republic]], and the White, [[Pechora Sea|Pechora]], [[Barents Sea|Barents]] and [[Kara Sea|Kara]] seas. [[Cape Fligely]] in [[Franz Josef Land]]  (the northernmost point of Russia, Europe and [[Eurasia]]) and [[Cape Zhelaniya]] in [[Novaya Zemlya]] (the easternmost point of Europe) are both located within Arkhangelsk Oblast. [[Mount Kruzenshtern]] is the highest point of the oblast.

Arkhangelsk Oblast is located on the [[East European Plain]], and most of it is forested, hilly landscape. The north-eastern part belongs to the [[Timan Ridge]], a highland mostly situated east from the oblast. The Nenets Autonomous Okrug is essentially a flat [[tundra]] ([[Bolshezemelskaya Tundra]]) with several hill chains like [[Pay-Khoy Ridge]].<ref name="GSE">{{cite book|title=Архангельская область|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article074044.html|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}</ref> The Arctic islands including Novaya Zemlya and Franz Joseph Land are mountainous with glaciers and eternally snow-covered.

[[File:Храмовый комплекс Пежмы.jpg|thumb|left|Landscape of [[Velsky District]] in Arkhangelsk Oblast]]

Almost all of the area of the Oblast belongs to the basin of the [[Arctic Ocean]], with the major rivers being the (from west to east) [[Onega River]], the [[Northern Dvina]] (with the major tributaries the [[Vychegda River|Vychegda]], the [[Vaga River|Vaga]], and the [[Pinega River|Pinega]]), [[Kuloy River (White Sea)|Kuloy River]], [[Mezen River]], and [[Pechora River]]s. A minor area in the west of the Oblast, most notably the basin of the [[Ileksa River]], drains into [[Lake Onega]] and eventually to the [[Baltic Sea]]. A very minor area in [[Kargopolsky District]] in the south-west of the Oblast drains into the [[Kema River]] which belongs to the basin of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The area in the Onega River basin containing the biggest lakes in the oblast, such as [[Lake Lacha]], [[Lake Kenozero]], [[Lake Undozero]], and [[Lake Kozhozero]]. The tundra of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug also contains a number of bigger lakes. The river basin of the Pinega is characteristic of the [[karst]], with a number of caves in the region.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The White Sea coast within the Oblast is split into the [[Onega Bay]] (where the Onega is the major tributary), the [[Dvina Bay]] (the Northern Dvina), and the [[Mezen Bay]] (comprising the Mezen and the Kuloy). The [[Solovetsky Islands]], as well as a number of smaller islands, are located in Onega Bay. Onega Bay and the Dvina Bay are separated by the [[Onega Peninsula]]. The Mezen Bay is separated from the main body of the White Sea by [[Morzhovets Island]]. Other major islands in the oblast include Shogly, Zhizgin, Yagry, Lyasomin, Layda, Nikolskiy, and Mudyugskiy islands.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Almost all of the oblast is covered by [[taiga]], the coniferous forest dominated by [[pine]], [[spruce]], and [[larch]]. Large areas in the middle of taiga are devoid of trees and covered by [[swamp]]s. In the [[floodplains]] of the rivers, there are meadows.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

A number of areas in Arkhangelsk Oblast have been designated as protected natural areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oopt.info/index.php?page=53|script-title=ru:ООПТ Северо-Западного округа|publisher=Особо охраняемые природные территории России|language=ru|access-date=June 7, 2011}}</ref> These are subdivided into [[national park]]s, nature reserves ([[zapovednik]]s), and [[zakaznik]]s of the federal level. The following protected areas have been designated,
*[[Kenozersky National Park]];
*[[Onezhskoye Pomorye National Park]]
*[[Russkaya Arktika National Park]] (which included previously established [[Franz Joseph Land Zakaznik]]);
*[[Vodlozersky National Park]] (shared with the [[Republic of Karelia]]);
*[[Pinezhsky Nature Reserve]];
*[[Siysky Zakaznik]].

Kenozersky and Vodlozersky National Parks have the status of [[UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]]. In addition, there are two protected areas in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, adjacent to each other: [[Nenetsky Nature Reserve]] and [[Nenetsky Zakaznik]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2022}}
The area of Arkhangelsk Oblast has been settled by [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] since prehistoric times, and most of the [[Toponymy|toponyms]] in the region are in fact Finno-Ugric. It was subsequently colonized by the [[Novgorod Republic]]. [[Kargopol]] was first mentioned in the chronicles in 1146, [[Shenkursk]] was mentioned in 1315, and [[Solvychegodsk]] was founded in the 14th century.

By the 13th century the Novgorodian merchants had already reached the [[White Sea]], attracted to the area for [[fur trading]]. The Novgorodians penetrated the area using the waterways, and this is why most of the ancient (as well as the modern) settlements were located into the main river valleys. The main historical areas of the Arkhangelsk region were [[Poonezhye]] ({{lang|ru|Поонежье}}) along the [[Onega River|Onega]], the [[Dvina Land]] along the [[Northern Dvina]], [[Pinezhye]] ({{lang|ru|Пинежье}}) along the [[Pinega River|Pinega]], Mezen Lands along the [[Mezen River|Mezen]], and [[Pomorye]] ({{lang|ru|Поморье}}) on the White Sea coast.

The main waterway was the Northern Dvina, and Novgorod merchants used the [[Volga River|Volga]] and its tributary, the [[Sheksna River|Sheksna]], along the Slavyanka River into Lake Nikolskoye, then the boats were taken by land to Lake Blagoveshchenskoye, from there downstream along the Porozovitsa River into [[Lake Kubenskoye]] and further to the [[Sukhona River|Sukhona]] and the Northern Dvina.<ref name="Plechko">{{cite book|last=Плечко|first=Л.А.|script-title=ru:Старинные водные пути|url=http://www.skitalets.ru/books/star_puti/|year=1985|publisher=Физкультура и спорт|location=Moscow|language=ru|access-date=August 29, 2011|archive-date=September 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925151704/http://www.skitalets.ru/books/star_puti/|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Portage]]s from the Northern Dvina Basin led further to the Mezen and the [[Pechora River|Pechora]].

After the fall of Novgorod in 1478, all these lands became a part of the [[Great Duchy of Moscow]]. Until 1703, the Northern Dvina served as the main export trading route of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]]. The local centers were [[Veliky Ustyug]] and [[Kholmogory, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Kholmogory]]; however, during the 17th century, Kholmogory lost its significance, and its role was gradually replaced by [[Arkhangelsk]].

In 1708, when the governorates were established by Tsar [[Peter the Great]], Arkhangelsk became the seat of one of the seven governorates of the Russian Empire.

At the same time, Arkhangelsk lands were one of the most remote areas in Russia. This fact was attractive for monks fleeing the crowds. In 1436, [[Solovetsky Monastery]] was founded, and it quickly became one of the richest and most influential Russian monasteries. Other monasteries followed. For instance, [[Kozheozersky Monastery]], founded in 1552, still remains one of the most remote [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] monasteries. After the [[Raskol|great schism]] in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1653, the area attracted many [[Old Believers]], who were persecuted by the state. Most would later flee to even more remote locations such as [[Siberia]].

In 1703, with the construction of St. Petersburg, Arkhangelsk, which lacked St. Petersburg's geographical proximity to Europe and the non-freezing harbour of [[Murmansk]], lost its significance as the main trading harbour of the Russian Empire. However, in the early 20th century Arkhangelsk was an important starting point for [[Arctic policy of Russia|Russian Arctic expeditions]]. For instance, in the 1830s [[Pyotr Pakhtusov]] sailed twice from Arkhangelsk to investigate and map [[Novaya Zemlya]].

In 1918 and 1919, Arkhangelsk Governorate became one of the most active battlegrounds of the [[Civil War in Russia]]. On 2 August 1918 Arkhangelsk was occupied by British and American troops, allied with the [[White movement]]. Administratively, they established the [[Supreme Administration of the Northern Region|Northern Oblast]] with the center in Arkhangelsk. This episode of the Civil War is known as the [[North Russia Intervention]]. The troops advanced to the south, occupied the station of [[Obozersky|Obozerskaya]] in September 1918, and moving along the Northern Dvina and the [[Vaga River]]s. The southernmost points occupied by the allies were [[Shenkursk]] and [[Verkhnyaya Toyma, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Verkhnyaya Toyma]]. The allies were hoping that the [[Aleksandr Kolchak]]'s forces would move in the direction of [[Kotlas]], however, the White Army was unable to advance in this direction. In January 1919, after the [[Battle of Shenkursk]], the allied forces were driven out of the Shenkursk area. Battles around the station of [[Plesetsk]]aya followed. On 20 February 1920 the [[Red Army]] entered Arkhangelsk, by which time all allied troops had already been evacuated.

In the 1930s, the Soviets carried out the same experiments in economics as elsewhere in Soviet Union. The peasants and fishermen were forcibly organized into [[collective farms]]. These were heavily subsidized, which eventually brought the agriculture to the collapse in the 1990s, when the subsidies stopped. Arkhangelsk Oblast was and remains attractive as an area for exile, forcible resettlement, and prison camps. Actually, the first prison camp, [[Solovki prison camp]], was created in 1920 on the premises of the former Solovetsky Monastery. [[Novaya Zemlya]] from the 1950s, when its population (mostly the [[Nenets people|Nenets]]) was strongly recommended to leave, became the military ground for nuclear bomb testing.

In 1932, the icebreaker ''[[Sibiryakov (1909 icebreaker)|Sibiryakov]]'' under the command of [[Vladimir Voronin (captain)|Vladimir Voronin]], sailing from Arkhangelsk, crossed the [[Northern Sea Route]] in a single navigation.

Arkhangelsk Oblast proper was established in 1937. Before 1991, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Arkhangelsk Oblast [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). In 1991 the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] lost all power.  The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor, came to be elected or appointed.

The [[Economic history of Russia|economic crisis of 1990s]], after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], struck Arkhangelsk Oblast very badly. Although there remains a strong demand for timber, the basis of the oblast's economy, the population of Arkhangelsk Oblast has steadily declined, especially in rural areas. Many villages either have been deserted, or are on the verge of disappearing.

==Politics==
[[File:Oblsovet Arkhangelsk.jpg|thumb|Oblast government seat]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Arkhangelsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the highest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Arkhangelsk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Arkhangelsk Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Arkhangelsk Oblast}}

The oblast is administratively divided into six [[city of federal subject significance|cities and towns under the oblast's jurisdiction]] ([[Arkhangelsk]], [[Koryazhma]], [[Kotlas]], [[Novodvinsk]], [[Onega, Russia|Onega]], and [[Severodvinsk]]), one [[closed city|city under the federal jurisdiction]] ([[Mirny, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Mirny]]), twenty-one districts (one of which is [[Novaya Zemlya]]), and two island territories ([[Franz Josef Land]] and [[Victoria Island (Russian Arctic)|Victoria Island]]).<ref name="OKATO">{{OKATO reference|11}}</ref> Another six towns ([[Kargopol]], [[Mezen, Mezensky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Mezen]], [[Nyandoma]], [[Shenkursk]], [[Solvychegodsk]], and [[Velsk]]) have the status of the towns of district significance.

[[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]], which is administratively subordinated to the oblast, is administratively divided into one district ([[Zapolyarny District]]) and one town of okrug significance ([[Naryan-Mar]]).

===Restricted access===
Huge areas within the limits of the oblast are included in the [[Border Security Zone of Russia|border security zone]], intended to protect the [[Borders of Russia|borders of the Russian Federation]] from unwanted activity. These restricted areas include all islands in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and in [[Barents Sea]], [[Morzhovets Island]], and most of the White Sea coast in Mezensky District. In particular, the area includes the town of [[Mezen, Mezensky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Mezen]] and the urban type settlement of [[Kamenka, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Kamenka]]. In order to visit the zone, a permit issued by the local [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] department is required.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Приказ ФСБ РФ от 2 июня 2006 года N 237 "О пределах пограничной зоны на территории Архангельской области"|journal=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]|volume=2006|url=http://www.mccme.ru/putevod/Border/border.html|language=ru}}</ref>

==Economy==
===Industry===
Arkhangelsk Oblast is one of the industrial regions of Russia. The region has a developed [[fishery]], forestry, woodworking, [[cellulose]], and paper industry. There are large reserves of natural resources: [[Lumber]], [[oil]], [[bauxite]], [[titanium]], [[gold]], [[manganese]], and [[basalt]]. In 2011, the paper production and related industries were responsible for 55% of all industrial production of the Oblast, food production&nbsp;– 11%, timber processing (excluding paper production) and furniture production&nbsp;– 12%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvinaland.ru/economy/|script-title=ru:Итоги социально-экономического развития Архангельской области (без учета Ненецкого автономного округа) за 1 квартал 2011 года|year=2011|publisher=Администрация Архангельской области|language=ru|access-date=July 1, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110619142314/http://dvinaland.ru/economy/| archive-date= June 19, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>

The principal industrial enterprises in Arkhangelsk Oblast are shipyards in Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk (including [[Sevmash]]), pulp and paper mills in Koryazhma and Novodvinsk, and bauxite extraction plant in [[Severoonezhsk]]. Almost any town has some timber works.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Сушильня на Сосновке.jpg|right|thumb|Dried fish in Solovetsky Islands.]]
Fishery traditionally was the main means of subsistence in the [[Pomor]] villages at the White Sea coast. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the fishermen were organized into [[Collective farming|collective]] and state farms ([[Sovkhoz]]'s) and the fishery was heavily subsidized. In the 1990s the subsidies were stopped, and the fishery went into a serious crisis, some of the villages were deserted.

In the valleys of the main rivers, there is some [[cattle breeding]] and crop and potato growing, which is, however, difficult due to the cold climate. [[Ustyansky District]] is notable for bee-keeping. Two notable breeds originate from Arkhangelsk Oblast. The [[Kholmogory cattle]], from Kholmogory and Arkhangelsk countryside, mostly black and white, was particularly stable against cold climate in Northern Russia and eventually spread well beyond the Arkhangelsk Region.<ref name="GSE_Kholm">{{cite book|title=Холмогорская порода|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article119500.html|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}</ref> The [[Mezen horse]]s, bred in the Mezen River valley, are rather small but suitable for difficult work and easily survive cold winters.<ref name="GSE_Mezen">{{cite book|title=Мезенская лошадь|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article075114.html|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}</ref>

The area of current Arkhangelsk Oblast has always been located on the trading routes connecting central Russia to the White Sea, and, in fact, in the 17th century the White Sea was the main sea export route for Russia. The whole course of the Northern Dvina is navigable, as well as the lower course of some of its tributaries, most notably the Vychegda, the Vaga, and the Pinega. The Mezen is also navigable in the lower course. The Onega is not navigable except for the two relatively short stretches because of the [[rapids]]. However, except for the lower course of the Vychegda and some parts of the Northern Dvina, there is currently very little or no regular passenger navigation on these rivers. They are used for cargo traffic though.

In 1765, a road was built between Saint-Petersburg and Arkhangelsk, mainly for postal service.<ref name="history_plesetsk">{{cite web|url=http://www.moples.ru/index.php?id=4 |script-title=ru:Краткая историческая справка Плесецкого района |year=2010 |publisher=МО "Плесецкий район" |language=ru |access-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326122005/http://www.moples.ru/index.php?id=4 |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> The road still exists and passes [[Kargopol]] and [[Plesetsk]], and it was paved in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ador.ru/news/2011/09/22/288.shtml|script-title=ru:Запущена "Дорога в космос"|date=September 22, 2011|publisher=«Дорожное агентство «Архангельскавтодор»|language=ru|access-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> One of the principal highways in Russia, [[M8 highway (Russia)|M8]], connects Moscow and Arkhangelsk, and passes [[Velsk]]. This highway is paved and heavily used. In general, the road network is grossly underdeveloped. Only several all-season highways, in addition to M8, cross the oblast boundaries: the one (partially unpaved) connecting Kotlas with [[Syktyvkar]]; the one (paved) connecting Kotlas to [[Veliky Ustyug]] and eventually with [[Vologda]] and [[Nikolsk, Vologda Oblast|Nikolsk]], the one (paved) from Konosha southwards, and two (unpaved) from Kargopol to [[Pudozh]] and to [[Solza]] and [[Belozersk]]. Most of the local roads are unpaved. Until 2008, there were no all-season roads connecting the main road network with the north-east of the oblast, including the town of Mezen and the selo of Leshukonskoye, and there are still no roads into the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, on the left bank of the Onega downstream from Severoonezhsk, and very few roads on the right bank of the Northern Dvina. Many rivers can be crossed only by ferry boats, which means they cannot be crossed during the ice melting period. There is regular bus service on the main roads.

[[File:Udimskaya railway.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Udimskaya narrow gauge railway]]]]
The principal railway line in the oblast is the railroad connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk. The piece between [[Vologda]] and Arkhangelsk was constructed in 1890s and passed through previously uninhabited areas between the valleys of the Northern Dvina and the Onega. The railroad construction gave the momentum to the population and exploitation of these areas. A branch from [[Konosha]] eastwards to [[Kotlas]] and further to [[Vorkuta]] was constructed in the 1940s to facilitate the transport of coal from the [[Komi Republic]]. From Kotlas, another branch continues south to [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]]. A branch from [[Obozersky]] to the west, to [[Onega, Russia|Onega]] and further to [[Belomorsk]], was built during [[World War II]] to secure the transport of goods from the harbour of [[Murmansk]] to central Russia. A piece of railroad between Arkhangelsk and [[Karpogory]] was also built in the 1970s and is expected to become part of the [[Belkomur]] project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belkomur.com/|script-title=ru:Белкомур|year=2007|publisher=ОАО МК «Белкомур»|language=ru|access-date=July 22, 2011}}</ref>&nbsp;— a railway line connecting Arkhangelsk via the [[Komi Republic]] with the [[Perm Krai]] and the [[Ural Mountains]]. Almost the entire rail network belongs to the [[Northern Railway (Russia)|Northern Railway]], which west of [[Onega, Russia|Onega]] connects to the [[Oktyabrskaya Railway]]. There is also a railway line from [[Severoonezhsk]] west to [[Yangory]] (an extension of the line from Puksa to Navolok), which belongs to the Department of Corrections. A big number of [[narrow gauge railway]]s were built in the 1950s and 1960s to facilitate the transport of timber, but since then most of these became unprofitable and have been destroyed.

In the 1970s and 1980s the aviation was active, with all district centers connected to Arkhangelsk with regular flights, [[Kotlas]] being the second important hub. Currently, it has almost disappeared. There are two airports in Arkhangelsk, but regular local flights are only carried out to the destinations which do not have rail or road connections, such as [[Novaya Zemlya]], Solovetsky Islands, the [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]], the [[Onega Peninsula]], and the north of the oblast. The exceptions with functioning airports are [[Mezen Airport|Mezen]], [[Leshukonskoye Airport|Leshukonskoye]], and [[Onega Airport|Onega]].

The oil transport system, [[Baltic Pipeline System]], runs through the oblast, with two oil-pumping station located at [[Urdoma]] and [[Privodino]].

The [[Kudemskaya narrow-gauge railway]] in 2010 has appeared in Forbes ranking, of 10 most beautiful railway routes of the world.

A notable subgroup of Russian population are the [[Pomors]], who reside along the White Sea coast and in the valleys of major rivers, speak [[Pomor dialects]] and are in fact the descendants of the [[Novgorod]] population who colonized the Russian North in 12th–13th centuries. In 2002 Census, approximately 6,500 residents of Arkhangelsk Oblast indicated their ethnicity as Pomors.

Arkhangelsk Oblast is famous for its wooden buildings which include churches, chapels, peasant houses and farms, and city houses. The choice of wood as the construction material is natural for a region almost exclusively covered by [[taiga]] and still being one of the biggest timber producers. Some of these buildings date from the 17th century. Churches and chapels are considered particularly fine, and almost all of these constructed prior to 1920s have been declared the cultural heritage at the federal or local levels. More than 600 buildings (both of timber and stone) are protected on the federal level.{{RKN_base}} An open-air ethnographic museum was open in the village of [[Malye Korely]] close to Arkhangelsk, with the purpose of preserving this heritage.
[[File:Собор Введенский, Сольвычегодск.jpg|left|thumb|Presentation Church in [[Solvychegodsk]]]]

The most notable wooden churches are triple church ensembles, which consist of two churches (a bigger, not heated, church used in the summer, and a smaller, heated church used in the winter) and a bell-tower. Not more than a dozen of these triple wooden ensembles survived, the best known being the one located in the [[Kizhi Pogost]] in the [[Republic of Karelia]] and is classified as [[World Heritage]]. Most of these ensembles are located in the Arkhangelsk Oblast, in particular, in the villages of [[Varzogory]] and [[Abramovskaya, Onezhsky District|Abramovskaya]] ([[Onezhsky District]]). Other notable wooden churches are located in Kargopolsky ([[Oshevenskoye]], [[Krasnaya Lyaga]], [[Saunino]] and others), [[Verkhnetoyemsky District|Verkhnetoyemsky]] ([[Soyezerskaya Pustyn]]), Onezhsky, [[Primorsky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Primorsky]], and [[Plesetsky District|Plesetsky]] ([[Porzhensky Pogost]]) districts.
Despite being listed as cultural heritage, most of these buildings are neglected and regularly burn down. As a matter of fact, the majority of the churches considered as masterpieces has been lost.<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ru:Русское деревянное зодчество|url=http://www.archnadzor.ru/?p=5950|access-date=June 6, 2011|year=1942|publisher=Академия архитектуры СССР|language=ru}}</ref> For instance, [[Verkhnemudyugsky Pogost]] in Onezhsky District, a triple church ensemble, burned down in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towns.ru/other/mudyuga.html|script-title=ru:Верховье|last=Rapenkova|first=Svetlana|language=ru|access-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref> A church and the bell-tower of the triple ensemble in [[Lyadiny]] ([[Kargopolsky District]]) burned down on 6 May 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://spb.itar-tass.com/c323/727755.html |title=В Архангельской области сгорели уникальные деревянные церковь и колокольня из храмового комплекса |date=May 6, 2013 |publisher=[[ITAR TASS]] |access-date=6 May 2013 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527224258/http://spb.itar-tass.com/c323/727755.html |archive-date=May 27, 2013 }}</ref>

The oblast preserves some of the best stone architectural ensembles in Russia. The ensemble of the [[Solovetsky Monastery]] (founded 1436, the earliest surviving buildings stem from the 16th century) has been designated as the World Heritage. The town of [[Kargopol]] contains a number of white-stone churches, the earliest of which, the [[Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ (Kargopol)|Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ]], originates from 1552. The [[Presentation Church (Solvychegodsk)|Presentation Church]] (1688–1712) in [[Solvychegodsk]]  is an acclaimed baroque masterpiece and one of the five surviving [[Stroganovs#Origins|Stroganov baroque churches]].

Two of the towns in the oblast&nbsp;– Kargopol and Solvychegodsk&nbsp;– are classified as historical towns by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in their historical centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2010/09/29/istor-posel-dok.html|title=Приказ Министерства культуры Российской Федерации, Министерства регионального развития Российской Федерации от 29 июля 2010 г.

The monasteries facilitated the development of [[icon painting]] which existed in the area well until the 19th century. No single unified icon style arose, and icons produced in current Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts are commonly known as Northern icon painting (''Северные письма''). Icons were produced in [[Solovetsky Monastery|Solovetsky]], [[Antoniev Siysky Monastery|Antoniev Siysky]], [[Kozheozersky Monastery|Kozheozersky]] and other monasteries, as well as in the towns of Kholmogory and Solvychegodsk. Solvychegodsk icon painting was sponsored by [[Stroganovs]] and generated the Stroganov icon painting school, which in the end of the 17th century was principally active in Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultnord.ru/Ikonopis.html|script-title=ru:Иконопись|publisher=The Arkhangelsk Regional Scientific Library|language=ru|access-date=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

The icon-painting techniques were transferred to the traditional wood painting known since the 17th century in the valleys of the Northern Dvina ([[Nizhnetoyemsky Selsoviet|Nizhnyaya Toyma]], [[Borok, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Borok]], [[Puchuga]], [[Permogorye]]), the Pinega, and the Mezen. It was used to decorate various wooden surfaces such as, for example, spinning distaffs or [[Chest (furniture)|chests]], and employed geometrical figures as well as images of plants, animals, and humans. The Arkhangelsk traditional wooden painting is special since the surface was prepared in a particular way before the painting started, similar to icons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultnord.ru/Narodnaja_rospis.html|script-title=ru:Народная роспись|publisher=The Arkhangelsk Regional Scientific Library|language=ru|access-date=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

Despite the fact that several notable Russian artists including [[Vasily Vereshchagin]] traveled into the region in the 19th century, professional (non-icon) painting did not develop in Arkhangelsk until the 1890s. [[Aleksandr Borisov (painter)|Aleksandr Borisov]], [[Stepan Pisakhov]], and [[Tyko Vylka]], all of them landscape painters interested in Northern and Arctic landscapes, are considered as the founders of Arkhangelsk painting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultnord.ru/Hudozhniki_Severa.html|script-title=ru:Художники Севера|publisher=The Arkhangelsk Regional Scientific Library|language=ru|access-date=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

Various [[handicraft]]s were developed in the area. The most notable ones are the [[Kholmogory bone carving]], existing since the 17th century,<ref name="GSE1">{{cite book|title=Холмогорская резная кость|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article119501.html|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}</ref> and [[Kargopol toys]], moulded painted [[clay]] figures of people and animals.

===Literature===
Like other areas of [[Northern Russia]], Arkhangelsk Oblast is notable for its [[folklore]]. Until the mid-20th century, fairy tales and [[bylina]]s were still performed on a daily basis by professional performers, some of whom, like [[Mariya Krivopolenova]], achieved prominence in Moscow and St. Petersburg. One of the first Arkhangelsk folklore collectors was [[Alexander Hilferding]], who actually died in [[Kargopol]] during his journey. Starting from the 1890s, folkloric expeditions were organized to the White Sea area, and later to other areas of the Arkhangelsk Governorate, in order to write down the tales and the bylinas, in particular, in Pomor dialects. In the 1920s, mostly due to the efforts of [[Anna Astakhova]], these expeditions became systematic. The results have been published. By the 1960s, the performing art was basically extinct. However, these folkloric motives and fairy tales inspired the literary works of [[Stepan Pisakhov]] and [[Boris Shergin]], who were both natives of Arkhangelsk.

Protopope [[Avvakum]], a 17th-century monk, who led the opposition (''[[raskol]]'') against the reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church, was exiled to [[Mézens|Mezen]] for two years in 1664, and in 1667 was imprisoned in [[Pustozyorsk]], currently in Nenets Autonomous Okrug, for 14 years before being burned alive. Avvakum is an author of about sixty literary works, including the ''Life of Avvakum'', most of which were written in Pustozyorsk and are considered among the most notable Russian literary pieces of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultnord.ru/Iz_istorii_razvitija_literatury_v_Arhangelskom_krae.html|script-title=ru:Из истории развития литературы в Архангельском крае|publisher=The Arkhangelsk Regional Scientific Library|language=ru|access-date=June 8, 2011}}</ref>

[[Mikhail Lomonosov]], a [[polymath]] and poet who created the basis of the modern [[Russian language|Russian literary language]], was born in 1711 in the village of Denisovka, close to [[Kholmogory, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Kholmogory]], though he left the area to pursue his studies at the age of 18 and spent most of his career in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. Denisovka was later renamed into Lomonosovo in his honour.

[[Aleksey Chapygin]], a historical novelist, was born in what is now Kargopol District. His first novels describe the peasant life of the Arkhangelsk Governorate.

In the 20th century, two of the authors of the [[Village prose]] movement in Soviet literature, which predominantly described rural life, were tightly connected with Arkhangelsk Region: [[Fyodor Abramov]] was born in the peasant family in the village of Verkola in [[Pinezhsky Uyezd]], and [[Aleksander Yashin]] lived in Arkhangelsk for some time. In their literary works, as well as in the works of [[Yury Kazakov]], a short story writer who traveled extensively in the Russian North, the life of Arkhangelsk peasants features prominently. The name of one of the Kazakov's books of short stories is ''Poedemte v Lopshengu''&nbsp;— Let us go to Lopshenga; [[Lopshenga]] is a selo on the White Sea coast.

Some of the [[Nenets Literature|Nenets authors]] lived in Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In particular, [[Tyko Vylka]] was born in Novaya Zemlya and was even the chairman of the Novaya Zemlya Island [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]. [[Vasily Ledkov]] lived in [[Naryan Mar]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Комановский|first=Б.

==Emergency handling==
In 1998, the [[Arkhangelsk Regional Rescue Service]] was established by the governor. The responsibility of the Rescue Service is to handle emergency situations, such as forest fires.

[[Polar bears]] are entering into human-occupied areas more frequently than in the past due to climate change effects. [[Global warming]] reduces sea-ice, forcing bears to come in to land to find food. An [[2019 mass invasion of Russian polar bears|invasion of polar bears]] took place in February 2019 in northeastern [[Novaya Zemlya]], with dozens of [[polar bear]]s seen entering homes, public buildings, and inhabited areas. [[Arkhangelsk region]]al authorities declared a state of emergency.<ref name='A3'>{{cite news |last1=Abellan Matamoros |first1=Cristina |title=Watch: Polar bear in Russian archipelago peeks inside a house |url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/02/12/watch-polar-bear-in-russian-archipelago-peaks-inside-a-house |access-date=14 February 2019 |agency=Euronews |publisher=euronews.com |date=13 February 2019}}</ref><ref name='A4'>{{cite news |last1=Stambaugh |first1=Alex |title=Polar bear invasion: Parents scared to send children to school in remote Russian archipelago |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/11/asia/polar-bears-russia-intl/index.html |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=CNN |date=12 February 2019}}</ref>
