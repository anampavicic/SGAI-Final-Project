'''Anyang''' ({{Korean|hangul=안양}}; {{IPA|ko|a.njaŋ}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], South Korea. With a population of approximately 600,000, it is the 20th largest city in South Korea. It is a [[satellite city]] of [[Seoul]] and located approximately {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Seoul]], and {{convert|19|km|abbr=on}} north of Suwon. It is connected to Seoul via the [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 4|Line 4]]. The City motto of Anyang is "Livable city, Proud citizens". City symbols are a grape mascot named 'Podong-i', [[Forsythia]] (flower), [[Ginkgo Biloba|Ginkgo]] (tree), and [[eagle]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.anyang.go.kr/new/A020000.jsp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416035231/http://en.anyang.go.kr/new/A020000.jsp|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 April 2010|title=The symbol of the city - ANYANG CITY|date=16 April 2010}}</ref>

==Geography==
Anyang is divided into two-halves for administrative purposes: the Manan District to the west and Dongan District to the east. The Manan District is an old and original downtown area centered on Anyang Station. It is dominated by a shopping area with outdoor markets, known as "ilbeonga" (first street). The Dongan District is a new, wealthy suburb of [[Pyeongchon]]. The tallest building in Anyang is the [[Acro Tower]], which was completed in April 2007. It is a twin-tower office building in the Dongan District, across the street from [http://www.anyang.go.kr/main.jsp Anyang City Hall]. Anyang is a convenient transportation center between Seoul and other major cities across the country.

Anyang spans {{convert|58.46|km2}}. Forest and fields constitute {{convert|30.15|km2|abbr=on}}, urban development constitutes {{convert|11.51|km2|abbr=on}}, dry fields constitute {{convert|1.8|km2|abbr=on}}, rice paddies constitutes {{convert|1.25|km2|abbr=on}}, and other land use constitutes {{convert|13.76|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="history.anyang.go.kr">{{cite web |url=http://history.anyang.go.kr/repository/WebWrite_images/ebookfile/2009/11/21/20091121015702/35stststatisticalyearbook.swf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722135940/http://history.anyang.go.kr/repository/WebWrite_images/ebookfile/2009/11/21/20091121015702/35stststatisticalyearbook.swf |archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> Anyang is surrounded by mountains on all four sides. These mountains are [[Gwanak Mountain]] and [[Samsung Mountain]] to the north, [[Suri Mountain]] to the southwest, and [[Cheongye Mountain]] and [[Morak Mountain]] to the other sides. There are eight streams and rivers in Anyang, with a length of {{convert|34|km}}.

The main river is [[Anyangcheon|Anyang River]] (one of the four main tributaries of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] in Seoul), which is {{convert|32.2|km|abbr=on}} long. It has a basin area of {{convert|275|km2|abbr=on}}, fed by 21 tributaries. The center of the overall elliptical basin topography is low and flat. The river runs through the center of Anyang city and is a common place for people to walk, jog, or ride bikes.<ref name="ucd.ie">{{cite conference|url=http://www.ucd.ie/dipcon/docs/theme08/theme08_03.PDF |title=Water Quality Management for Ecological Restoration in Anyang Stream |date=31 July 2003 |publisher=[[University College Dublin]] |conference=Diffuse Pollution Conference Dublin  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607004730/http://www.ucd.ie/dipcon/docs/theme08/theme08_03.PDF |archive-date=7 June 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The river flows through seven cities in [[Gyeonggi Province]]. This, however, has caused major issues with pollution. River banks are often covered with parking lots or athletic fields, combined with poor sewerage systems in the upper reaches of the river. As a result, the Anyang Stream Watershed Management Committee for Water Quality Improvement had been established to address some of these issues.<ref name="ucd.ie"/>

Between 1974 and 1977, Samduck paper and Samyoung hardboard factories poured [[industrial waste]] into the Suam and Samseong Rivers (two of the tributaries of Anyang River), causing the rivers to become toxic. This pollution was serious, and local residents dug pools to collect the industrial waste, producing a large, damp paper slab at the base of the pools. Local elder women citizens cut out the paper slabs into blocks that were sold back to Samduck; the remaining residues from the drying process were kept and used as fire fuel by the residents during winter. The "owner of Samduck recently donated his factory ground to the city as a gesture of compensation to the citizens of Anyang".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://williamhsu.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/my-residency-project/ |title=Collecting Towards a Paper Museum in Anyang |date=1 December 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607004829/https://williamhsu.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/my-residency-project/ |archive-date=7 June 2017 }}</ref> In November 2008, the site reopened as a city park.

===Climate===
Anyang has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), but can be considered a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') using the {{convert|-3|C}} isotherm. Anyang has very cold and dry in winter and hot and humid in summer. However, Anyang is cooler than Seoul in summer. The average annual temperature is 12.3 °C, while the average rainfall is 1,344 mm. Around two-thirds of Anyang's rainfall occurs during monsoon season between June and August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.anyang.go.kr/new/A040000.jsp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416035236/http://en.anyang.go.kr/new/A040000.jsp|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 April 2010|title=Location and Climate - ANYANG CITY|date=16 April 2010}}</ref>

==History==
The name Anyang originates from Anyang mall which was established by [[Wang Geon]], the First Emperor of the [[Goryeo dynasty]]. In the fourth year of [[Hyōgong]], king of Silla (900), Wang Geon, a general of [[Gung Ye]], was passing through [[Samsung Mountain]] to quell the rebellion in the [[Gumju]] (Siheung) and [[Gwaju]] (Gwacheon) areas. During their travels, the troops met an old Buddhist priest named [[Neungjung]], and while listening to the priest, Wang Geon had the idea of building a temple at the location. Anyang itself is a Buddhist term signifying a heavenly land where unimaginable joy and freedom overflow.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

As with most towns and cities in South Korea, Anyang has experienced tremendous urban growth during the past few decades. Anyang was severely battered by warfare during the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zQgpAAAAIBAJ&pg=4152,948532&dq=anyang+history+korea&hl=en|title=Allied Tanks Shatter Reds|newspaper=The Deseret News|date=5 February 1951}}</ref> Ten years after it ended, the area's population was still largely rural and its landscape agricultural. It was well known for its grape growing. Anyang was given city status in 1973 and has grown to become the 15th most populated city in the country. It is also becoming a commuter city for many workers in Seoul because of its close proximity.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===City plans===
In early 2010, previous Anyang mayor, Phil-woon Lee announced plans to build a 100-storey city hall. It was thought that it could house a hotel, cinemas, shopping complexes and other facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/02/113_60040.html |title=Anyang Mayor Defends New City Hall Plan |access-date=2015-04-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409012342/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/02/113_60040.html |archive-date=9 April 2015}}</ref> However, the plans garnered negative responses from both central government and local residents, as several other local governments recently built new city hall at great tax payer expense.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/02/116_60280.html |title=State Auditors to Investigate Luxury Municipal Buildings |access-date=2015-04-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409013157/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/02/116_60280.html |archive-date=9 April 2015}}</ref>

==Crime==
In 2007 there were 16,311 reported cases of crime in Anyang. There were 13,771 arrests made during the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.anyang.go.kr/repository/WebWrite_images/ebookfile/2009/11/21/20091121015702/35stststatisticalyearbook.swf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722135940/http://history.anyang.go.kr/repository/WebWrite_images/ebookfile/2009/11/21/20091121015702/35stststatisticalyearbook.swf |archive-date=22 July 2011}} (pp. 578-579)</ref> In 2008, there were 20,854 crimes. The following year, there were 16,990 crimes. However, the recent installation of new CCTV has led to the crime rate decreasing.

==Pollution==
In 2013, Anyang (along with Busan) was listed as one of the most polluted cities (in terms of air pollution) in the world's largest economies, with nearly 70 micrograms of particulate matter of less than 10 micron size per cubic meter.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/01/daily-chart-11?fsrc=rss | newspaper=The Economist | title=Choked | date=16 January 2013}}</ref>

From 2016 to now, the construction of [[GS Group|GS]] [[cogeneration]] system lead to many conflicts between GS and the residents living near [[Pyeongchon-dong, Anyang|Pyeongchon-Dong]]. Many people believe that the power plant increases air pollution, which is already a heavy issue in Korea.

==Facilities==

===Housing===
A huge redevelopment is proposed for the Manan Gu area, beginning in late 2010, with the focus on urban renewal. The proposal would see the building of approximately 24,000 apartment units built over an area of 1,776,000 m<sup>2</sup> and see the destruction and redevelopment of the area around [[Anyang Station]].<ref name="arch.columbia.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.columbia.edu/work/courses/studio/sp10-yang |title=Reconstruction: Updating the City Block for Next 30 Years &#124; GSAPPonline |access-date=2010-04-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330203555/http://www.arch.columbia.edu/work/courses/studio/sp10-yang |archive-date=30 March 2010}}</ref> The Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at [[Columbia University]], in conjunction with the Anyang Public Art Project 2010, has had its students working on concept plans and designs for the redevelopment of the Hogye Apartments in Dongan Gu.<ref name="arch.columbia.edu"/>

==Transportation==
Anyang is well served by bus, subway and rail services. The intercity bus terminal is located directly opposite [[Anyang Station]] which was first opened in January 1905. It was rebuilt into a large, modern building, which reopened in December 2001 and is adjacent to [[Lotte Department Store]]. It takes approximately 40 minutes on line one from Anyang to [[Seoul Station]]. There are six other stations in Anyang: Myeonghak, Gwanak and Seoksu, and Beomgye, Pyeongchon and Indeogwon, the first three on line one and the latter three on line four.

While technically not in Anyang itself, the [[Gwangmyeong Station]] is located less than 10 minutes drive to the northwest of Anyang Station and essentially exists to service Anyang city and other nearby cities. Thus, when using KTX, [[Gwangmyeong Station]] or [[Suwon Station]] is useful.
