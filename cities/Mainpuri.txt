On the south of Mainpuri is the railway, along with the train station.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> [[Mainpuri railway station]] was deliberately built in the middle of an unproductive ''usar'' plain so it wouldn't take away from the available farmland.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 231 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|229, 231}}

The main street in Mainpuri is a section of the Agra road running east–west through town.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> This is the main commercial centre and many of the public buildings are built here.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> The [[Bhanwat]] road branches off from the main road and heads south to the train station.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 230 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|229-30}}

Mainpuri historically consisted of two separate settlements: [[Mainpuri Khas]], the old town, in the north and surrounding the raja's ''garhi'' (fort-palace complex); and Mukhamganj, or Ganj, further south on the main road.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> The Katra road historically marked the southern boundary of Mainpuri Khas.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 230 --> Mainpuri Khas was historically surrounded by a wall, with six gates.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> The names of five are known: the Debi, Tal, Madar, Deoraya, and Ganesh Darwazas.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> The name of the sixth is not recorded.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> Nagaria, a suburb of Mainpuri, is near where the Tal Darwaza once stood.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 231 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|229-31}}

==History==
According to tradition, a branch of the Chauhan Rajputs came to Mainpuri from [[Asauli]] under one Raja Partab Rudr sometime between 1363 and 1391 (1420-1448 ''[[samvat]]'').<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 231 --> They were accompanied by fighters from the [[Mathuriya Brahman]]s, who later became merchants instead.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 231 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|231}}

A new site called Mukhamganj, which is now the main part of town, was founded in 1746 by Raja Jaswant Singh on the Grand Trunk Road.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --> It was named after Mukham Singh, who is variously recorded as a son of Jaswant's who born out of wedlock or as his own childless brother.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --> The new town quickly grew as people moved here from the town of [[Karimganj, Mainpuri|Karimganj]], further north.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --> Mukhamganj quickly eclipsed Karimganj, which dwindled from a large town to a smaller village.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|232}}

In 1802, the British founded a [[Civil Lines|civil station]] just east of Mainpuri to serve as the headquarters of the new [[Etawah district]].<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --> The civil station consisted of three settlements: Gola Bazar, Nagla Chamaran, and Nagla Pazawa.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 233 --> Due to its position as an administrative headquarters, the entire town of Mainpuri quickly grew.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --> In 1804, it was attacked and pillaged by forces under [[Yashwant Rao Holkar]], the Maratha ruler of [[Indore State|Indore]].<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|232}}

Major construction was done in Mainpuri from 1848 to 1850, involving the Raikesganj marketplace and a school, and again in the 1870s, involving three marketplaces, a post office, more schools, and a drainage system for the city.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 232 --> The three marketplaces built in the 1870s included one for vegetable produce, one for ghee and cotton, and one, called Laneganj after its builder, for grain.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 230, 2 --> Laneganj, which replaced Raikesganj as the city's main grain market, stretched from the Raikesganj sarai in the south to the intersection of the Katra and Kuraoli roads in the north, on the border with Mainpuri Khas.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 230 --> A large masonry tank was also built next to the Laneganj market, with a stone [[chhatri]] at each corner.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 230 --> In the hotter part of the year, the tank was fed by a canal coming up to the town from the south, where it ultimately branched off from the Nagaria distributary.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 230 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|230, 232}}

At the turn of the 20th century, there was still a large open area between the town of Mainpuri and the train station to the south.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 230-1 --> There was a [[brickyard]] in this area.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 231 --> At the east end of town was a cotton ginning mill.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 233 --> There were about 20 makers of ''tarkashi'' work (wood inlaid with brass wire) in the city at the time.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 73 --> In terms of commerce, there was an active trade in cotton, grain, iron, and vegetables.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 223 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|73, 231, 233}}

At this time, Mainpuri was divided into four wards (two in Mainpuri Khas and two in Mukhamganj).<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> The wards in Mainpuri Khas were Misrana, comprising the [[mohalla]]s Katra, Misrana, and Chautiana; and Purohitana, comprising the mohallas Purohitana, Sotiana, Baghban, and Bharatwal.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> The wards in Mukhamganj were Chhapaiti, comprising the mohallas Agarwala, Lohai, and Chhapaiti; and Gariwan, comprising the mohallas Gariwan, Saraogian, and Dariba.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|229}}

As of the 1901 census, the city of Mainpuri had a population of exactly 19,000 (not counting the civil station, which had a population of exactly 1,000).<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> The population was 73% Hindu (13,955) and 23% Muslim (4,436); the remaining 3% (609) followed other religions.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --> Sometime between 1901 and 1910, the city limits were expanded southward to include the train station.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 229 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|229}}

==Industry==
[[Cotton gin]]ning, oilseed milling, lamp and [[glass]] manufacturing constitute the prominent industries. [[Peanut]] farming is a small but well-spread out industry. The town is also renowned for its [[tobacco]] and wooden sculptures. A large amount of the population depends on agriculture produce to fulfill daily needs. The agricultural equipment industry is predominant — Siyaram Agency is one of the leading equipment manufacturers in the district.

===''Tarkashi''===
Mainpuri is renowned for its woodwork inlaid with brass wire, a process known as ''tarkashi'' (literally "wire-drawing").<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 73 --> Dark [[shisham]] wood is the main type of wood used, and some of the items commonly decorated in this way are footwear, plates and trays, various small boxes, and photo frames.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 73 --> ''Tarkashi'' items are made by gently hammering brass strips into chiselled-out incisions in the wood.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 74 --> A [[stencil]] is used to mark out complex designs beforehand.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 73-4 --> ''Tarkashi'' work is typically a slow process – a plate with a 30&nbsp;cm [[diameter]] can take up to 20 days – so the items tend to be relatively expensive.<!-- Gazetteer 1910, p. 74 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1910"/>{{rp|73-4}}

==Places of interest==
[[File:AsianOpenbillWithPilaglobosa Mainpuri.JPG|thumb|{{center|Krouncha, [[sarus crane]] (''[[Grus antigone]]'')}}]]
