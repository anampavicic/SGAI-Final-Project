'''Harju County''' ({{lang-et|Harju maakond}} or ''Harjumaa''), is one of the fifteen [[counties of Estonia]]. It is situated in northern [[Estonia]], on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], and borders [[Lääne-Viru County]] to the east, [[Järva County]] to the southeast, [[Rapla County]] to the south, and [[Lääne County]] to the southwest. The [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of Estonia, [[Tallinn]], is situated in Harju County.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitharju.ee/index.php|title=Harjumaa Turism|website=www.visitharju.ee|access-date=Nov 25, 2020}}</ref> Harju is the largest county in Estonia in terms of population, as almost half (45%) of Estonia's population lives in Harju County.

== History ==
{{main|Harjumaa (ancient county)|Revala}}

[[File:Toompea linnus.jpg|thumbnail|[[Toompea Castle]] in [[Tallinn]]. Its [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''Castrum Danorum'' might refer to the origin of the names "Tallinn" and "Lindanise", meaning "Danish Town" or "Danish Castle".]]
[[File:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[Flag of Denmark]] (''Dannebrog'') as falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] in 1219. It is now depicted on the coat of arms of both Tallinn and Harju County.]]

===Ancient history===
The territory of modern Harju County consists mostly of two [[ancient Estonia]]n counties: [[Revala]], around what is now Tallinn, and [[Harjumaa (ancient county)|Harjumaa]], which was situated south of Revala and presently rests mostly in [[Rapla County]]. Lindanise, then a small trading post at the [[Gulf of Finland]], served as the capital of Revala. It eventually grew into the mostly [[Germans|German-populated]] [[Hanseatic league|Hanseatic]] town of ''Reval'' and later into the [[Estonia]]n capital, Tallinn.

===Conquest===
[[File:Kadrioru loss by HolgerVaga.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Russian Empire|Russian]] Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] started the construction of [[Kadriorg Palace]] near [[Tallinn]] and named it after his wife [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] (''Catherinethal'').]]

In 1219, the [[Denmark|Danish]] King, [[Valdemar II]], [[Battle of Lyndanisse|landed in Lindanise]] ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Lyndanisse'') and conquered both Revala and Harju counties, while the inhabitants were forced into [[Christianity]]. At the end of the [[Livonian Crusade]] (1208–1227 in Estonia), both counties were captured by the [[Order of the Sword Brothers]] until given back to Denmark with the [[Treaty of Stensby]] in 1238.

The Danes built the [[Toompea Castle]] (''Castrum Danorum'') on [[Toompea]] Hill in Tallinn, which quickly became the biggest settlement in Estonia. In 1248, it was the first settlement in Estonia to receive its town rights, and in 1285 it became the northernmost member of the [[Hanseatic League]].

German dominance led to the [[St. George's Night Uprising]], which broke out in 1343 with the burning of [[Padise Abbey]] in modern [[Padise Parish]]. The uprising led Denmark to sell its possessions in Northern Estonia to the [[Livonian Order]]. In 1561, after the outbreak of the [[Livonian War]], the nobility of North Estonia and the Tallinn Town Council declared loyalty to [[Sweden]]. Tallinn and other Swedish-occupied territories gained during warfare were secured by the [[Treaty of Plyussa]].

During the [[Great Northern War]], Harju was one of the few regions in Estonia untouched by warfare for a long time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=How long?}} Nonetheless, Harju County was greatly affected by the [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|1710-1713 Plague]] that killed more than eighty percent of the county's population. Russian forces finally arrived in 1710 and laid siege to Tallinn for a month until the [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|Swedish garrison surrendered]], thus ending the Great Northern War in Estonia. Russian rule was secured with the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721. The plague raged on for several years, eventually leaving several parts of the county completely empty of human habitation.

===Russian rule===

[[File:Bochmann B0024 - Fischmarkt.jpg|thumbnail|right|"Old Fish Market Near Tallinn" by [[Gregor von Bochmann]]]]

[[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] rule started with the construction of naval harbours in Tallinn and [[Paldiski]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Rogerwiek''). Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] visited Tallinn at least nine times between 1711 and 1723. He personally opened the construction for Tallinn Naval Harbour in 1714 and Paldiski Naval Harbour in 1718.

In 1870, the [[Paldiski]]-[[Tallinn]]-[[St. Petersburg]] Railway was opened, after which several smaller settlements along the line - Paldiski, [[Keila]], [[Saue]], [[Nõmme]], [[Aruküla]], [[Raasiku]], [[Kehra]] and [[Aegviidu]] (then in Viru County) - started to grow. Several elements of [[Peter the Great's Naval Fortress]] were built in Harju County and its headquarters were in Tallinn.

During [[World War I]] in 1914, the native population of [[Naissaar]] island was expelled from the island and it was turned into a military base. A narrow-gauge railway network was built on the island. Tallinn was the site for the very beginning of the [[October Revolution]] when the Estonian [[Bolshevik]] [[Jaan Anvelt]] took power in Tallinn on 5 November 1917, two days before the Revolution started in [[Petrograd]]. On 9 November 1917, the Bolsheviks took power from Governor [[Jaan Poska]]. After the coup, refusing to cooperate with the Estonian Soviet Executive Committee, the [[Estonian Provincial Assembly]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''Maanõukogu'') in Tallinn declared sovereignty from the Russian Empire on 28 November 1917. In December 1917, Russian sailors under the leadership of [[Stepan Maximovich Petrichenko]] declared the "Soviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders of Naissaar". They were ousted by German forces on 26 February 1918.

===Republic of Estonia===
The Republic of Estonia was proclaimed in Tallinn on 24 February 1918 while German occupation followed on the next day. German rule ended with the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]] in Germany. During the [[Estonian War of Independence]], Soviet troops were halted only 40&nbsp;km east of Tallinn by the end of 1918. Tallinn was the site of a failed Communist [[1924 Estonian coup d'état attempt|coup d'état attempt of 1924]].

===Occupation era===

====Soviet occupation====
On 18 September 1939, after both [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the [[Poland|Polish]] submarine [[ORP Orzeł (1938)|ORP Orzeł]] escaped from [[internment]] in Tallinn Harbor during the [[Orzeł incident]]. The submarine eventually made her way to the [[United Kingdom]], which led both the Soviet Union and Germany to question Estonia's [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. On 24 September 1939, [[Soviet Navy]] warships appeared in North Estonian waters and [[Soviet Air Force]] bombers patrolled above Tallinn and the nearby countryside.

The Soviet Union demanded that Estonia allow the Soviet military bases and stationed 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for the duration of the European war. On 28 September 1939, the government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum and signed the [[Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty|mutual assistance treaty]]. [[Paldiski]] was made a Soviet Naval Base and its population was expelled from the town. With its new military bases in Northern Estonia, the Soviet Union invaded [[Finland]] on 30 November 1939, starting the [[Winter War]]. During 1939–1940, most of the [[Baltic German]] population from Tallinn and the Harju County countryside fled to Germany (''[[Umsiedlung]]'').

On 14 June 1940, the Soviet Navy set up a naval blockade in the [[Gulf of Finland]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] and stationed a navy squadron west of Naissaar island near Tallinn. Soviet bombers shot down the passenger airplane "[[Kaleva (airplane)|Kaleva]]" near [[Keri (island)|Keri]] island, killing all nine on board, which had included foreign diplomats.

On 16 June 1940, the [[Red Army]] invaded Estonia and organised a Soviet ''coup d'état'' in Tallinn. On 21 June 1940, the Independent Signal Battalion in Tallinn showed resistance to the Red Army, until it surrendered and was disarmed on the same day. The Soviet powers organised rigged parliamentary elections and the new parliament declared the [[Estonian SSR]] on 21 July 1940, which was annexed by the Soviet Union on 6 August 1940. Most county and municipal leaders were replaced and local assemblies were replaced with [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]. The native population of Naissaar island was expelled from the island (as in 1914) as the island was turned into a military base. During the 1940–41 Soviet Occupation, thousands were executed, imprisoned, mobilised into the Red Army [[labour battalion]]s or deported to Siberia on 14 June 1941 ([[June deportation]]).

====Summer War====
[[File:Tallinn defence1941.jpg|thumbnail|left|Battles for Tallinn in August 1941]]
Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941 and Finland declared the [[Continuation War]] with the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. As the Soviet Union retreated, its [[destruction battalions]] carried out the [[scorched-earth]] tactics. The [[Erna long-range reconnaissance group]] was sent from Finland to Northern Estonia on 10 July 1941 to perform [[reconnaissance]] of the retreating Red Army, but it eventually engaged the destruction battalions near Kautla forest ([[Battle of Kautla]]) on 31 July to 1 August 1941, allowing 2,000 civilians to flee.

German forces started its Tallinn Offensive on 19 August 1941, capturing [[Rapla]] on 21 August 1941. They reached Tallinn outskirts in [[Pirita]] on 24 August 1941 and [[Harku]] and [[Lasnamäe]] on 26 August 1941. Ordinary citizens were ordered to build defenses around Tallinn. Soviet forces started [[Soviet evacuation of Tallinn|evacuating by sea]] on 24 August 1941. Of the 195 ships, that left Tallinn and Paldiski, 55 were sunk by mines near [[Juminda]] Peninsula, killing around 15,000 evacuees. Evacuating Soviet forces destroyed much of the infrastructure and industry around Tallinn. German forces captured Paldiski and Tallinn on 28 August 1941, shooting down the [[Soviet Flag]] on Tallinn [[Pikk Hermann]] Tower. Estonians replaced it with the [[Flag of Estonia]], but it was replaced with the [[Flag of Germany]] the next day. German forces were greeted as liberators in Tallinn. It was also the first time since 1219 that Tallinn had been captured following a military engagement.

====German occupation====
{{main|German occupation of Estonia during World War II}}
Northern Estonia was the site of several [[concentration camp]]s and massacres. In September 1942, up to three thousand foreign [[Jews]] and [[Gypsy (term)|Gypsies]] were executed at [[Kalevi-Liiva]] in Jõelähtme Parish, while the rest were sent to the small [[Jägala concentration camp]] nearby, that never had more than 200 prisoners as their lifespan was short. [[Klooga concentration camp]] in Keila Parish was mostly evacuated before the Soviet takeover, however, 2,000 prisoners were executed before the German retreat. The Red Army liberated the few survivors on 22 September 1944.

<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Estonia threatre after bombing.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Estonia Theatre]] after the [[Bombing of Tallinn in World War II]]]] -->
Tallinn [[Bombing of Tallinn in World War II|was bombed]] by the [[Soviet Air Force]] on 9 and 10 March 1944, killing 757 people and destroying 8,000 buildings (about one-third of the capital). Among others, Harju Street, [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St. Nicholas' Church]], and [[Estonia Theatre]] were hit. 36-38 Soviet [[bomber]]s were shot down during the bombardment.

After the Red Army [[Battle of Tannenberg Line|broke through the Tannenberg Line]] in Eastern Estonia and crossed the [[Emajõgi]] river near Tartu, it launched the [[Tallinn Offensive]] on 17 September 1944 when [[Adolf Hitler]] had agreed to start abandoning Estonia on 16 September 1944. The [[National Committee of the Republic of Estonia]] was formed in Tallinn in March 1944 and the last [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] [[Jüri Uluots]] organized a new government under [[Otto Tief]] on 18 September 1944, captured government offices in Tallinn on 20 September 1944, and put the Estonian flag on top of the Pikk Hermann Tower.

German forces started [[Tallinn Offensive|Operation Aster]] to evacuate its 50,000 soldiers and 20,000 civilians through Tallinn and [[Paldiski]]. On the way, the [[hospital ship]] "Moero" was attacked and sunk by the Soviet Air Force, killing 637 of its passengers. The retreating German forces avoided conflict with the Red Army in Tallinn and the invading army saw only little resistance by Estonian units led by Rear Admiral [[Johan Pitka]]. The Red Army entered Tallinn on 22 September and Paldiski on 24 September 1944.

Before the Soviet reoccupation in 1944, thousands fled to [[Sweden]] across the Baltic Sea, including the entire [[Estonian Swedes|Estonian Swedish]] population, who had been settling also on Pakri islands in Harju County.

====Second Soviet occupation====
The [[Forest Brothers]] resistance movement was considered to be the weakest in Harju County, due to dense population, fewer forests and more Soviet military activity. New [[Operation Priboi|deportations followed]] in 1949. The Soviet era brought development of heavy industry, a massive influx of foreign workers from throughout the [[Soviet Union]] and construction of new districts ([[Maardu]], [[Mustamäe]], [[Väike-Õismäe]] and [[Lasnamäe]]) for Tallinn.

[[Sokos Hotel Viru|Hotel Viru]] in Tallinn was built in 1972 as the first modern highrise in Estonia. The [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics Sailing events]] were held in Tallinn. The event also brought major construction, such as the seaside road from Central Tallinn to [[Pirita]], renovation projects in Tallinn Old Town and the iconic highrise [[Hotel Olümpia]] and [[Tallinn TV Tower]].

In 1962, Paldiski became a [[Soviet Navy]] [[Nuclear navy|nuclear submarine]] training centre and had two land-based [[nuclear reactor]]s with 16,000 employees. It was a [[Closed city|closed town]] until the last Russian warship left in August 1994. Until then it was the last Russian military base in Estonia. Russia relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in September 1995.

== Administrative history ==
[[File:Atlas von Liefland 10.tif|thumbnail|left|Map of Harju County after the separation of Paldiski County in 1783–1796]]

===Formation of the county===

The ancient counties of [[Harjumaa (ancient county)|Harjumaa]] and [[Revala]] were merged into Harju County in 1266. It remained within most of its borders until 1949 (with the exclusion of 1783–1796, when Paldiski County was separated).

During the Soviet occupation, in 1940, Tallinn became a [[City of federal subject significance|city of republic significance]]. [[Loksa]] was transferred to Viru County in 1949. The rest of Harju County was replaced with four [[raion]]s during the Soviet occupation in 1950. Harju Raion around Tallinn gradually absorbed the former areas of Harju County as [[Loksa]] Raion was abolished in 1957, [[Kose]] Raion in 1959 and [[Keila]] Raion in 1962 and most of their territories transferred to Harju Raion. [[Aegviidu]], Aegviidu Village Council and [[Kohila]] Village Council were transferred to Harju Raion in 1962. Harju Raion and the remaining Rapla Raion became Harju County and [[Rapla County]] in 1990. Tallinn was reincorporated into Harju County in 1993.

===Municipal history===
[[File:Map of Tallinn, 1810.jpg|thumbnail|right|Map of [[Tallinn]] with its two municipalities ([[Toompea]] and Lower Town) in 1810]]

====Urban municipalities====
Tallinn was the first settlement in Harju County to receive town rights in 1248. Municipally, it consisted of the "upper town" of [[Toompea]] and the "lower town". The two municipalities were merged in 1877. The naval harbour town of Paldiski received its town rights in 1783. [[Nõmme]] was given a town status in 1926 and [[Keila]] in 1938.

Soviet powers merged Nõmme with Tallinn already in 1940. They also separated Tallinn from Harju County and it became a [[Direct-controlled municipality|centrally administered town]]. The same was applied to Paldiski in 1941. The German occupation of 1941-1944 left only Tallinn separated from Harju County. The Soviet reoccupation brought Paldiski back to central administration. Tallinn was divided into four urban raions in 1945 and it gained several new territories from its surrounding parishes. [[Aegviidu]] (then in [[Järva County]]), [[Järvakandi]] and [[Kohila]] (both now in Rapla County) and [[Kehra]] were named boroughs. The central administration of Paldiski was abolished in 1950 when Paldiski was merged with Keila Raion. Tallinn absorbed [[Saue]] in 1960 and [[Maardu]] in 1962 and the latter became a town within the municipality of Tallinn in 1980.

Maardu and Saue were separated from Tallinn in 1991 and Kehra, [[Loksa]] and Saue were given town status in 1993. The central administration of Tallinn was abolished and the town was re-transferred into Harju County. Its urban raions were abolished in 1993 and replaced with eight modern districts.

====Rural municipalities====
[[Ancient Estonia]]n counties were divided into parishes ([[Estonian language]]: ''kihelkond''), that became centered on local churches from the 13th century. Modern municipal parishes (Estonian: ''vald'') were created in the 19th century. They were created within the old parishes, that were still centered on the local church.

Soviet rule brought major changes in rural municipalities as local village councils were created throughout 1945. The parishes were abolished with the creation of raions in 1950. [[Naissaar|Naissaar Parish]] had been abolished and given to the [[Red Army]] already in 1940 and [[Pakri Islands|Pakri Parish]] had been abolished and merged with [[Paldiski]] in 1947.

Village councils were renamed "parishes" in 1990–1993. [[Kehra]] merged into [[Anija Parish]] in 2002, [[Loksa Parish]] merged into [[Kuusalu Parish]] in 2005 and [[Kõue Parish]] merged into [[Kose Parish]] in 2013.

[[File:Waterfall Jägala.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Jägala Falls]] in winter]]

Harju County lies on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Its shores are dominated by the North-Estonian coastal plain and the [[Baltic Klint|North-Estonian Klint]] separates the plain from Harju plateau in central and southern Harju County. The forested Kõrvemaa area is situated in eastern Harju County and the West-Estonian plain in western Harju County.

===Shoreline===
The shoreline is mostly low, but is at some places close to the high North-Estonian Klint. The coastal cliff is the highest in [[Rannamõisa]] ({{cvt|35|m}}) and [[Türisalu]] ({{cvt|30|m}}) in [[Harku Parish]], and in three points in Paldiski: Pakri Peninsula ({{cvt|24|m}}), Leetse ({{cvt|20|m}}) and [[Väike-Pakri]] island ({{cvt|13|m}}). There are also several long sand beaches, for example [[Kakumäe]], Stroomi in [[Pelguranna]], Pikakari in [[Paljassaare]] and [[Pirita]] along the shoreline and [[Lake Harku]] in [[Pikaliiva]], all within Tallinn, and [[Kloogaranna]] and [[Kaberneeme]] in the countryside. The shoreline is also characterized by many peninsulas, such as [[Paldiski|Pakri]], [[Lohusalu]], [[Suurupi]], [[Kakumäe]], [[Kopli]], [[Paljassaare]], [[Viimsi]], [[Ihasalu]], [[Kaberneeme]], [[Juminda]] and [[Pärispea]].

===Islands===
The shoreline is dotted with several islands, with the largest ones being [[Naissaar]] ({{cvt|18.6|km2}}), [[Väike-Pakri]] ({{cvt|12.9|km2}}), [[Suur-Pakri]] ({{cvt|11.6|km2}}), [[Prangli]] ({{cvt|6.4|km2}}), [[Aegna]] ({{cvt|2.9|km2}}) and [[Rammu]] ({{cvt|1.0|km2}}). All of the larger islands and several of the smaller islands have had a considerable historical population. [[Pakri Islands]], Naissaar and Prangli even formed separate municipalities. Their population diminished during Soviet occupation, either gradually or by force. Today, Prangli (73 inhabitants) and Naissaar (three inhabitants) both consist of three villages within [[Viimsi Parish]]. Aegna (eight inhabitants) is a subdistrict in [[Kesklinn, Tallinn|Kesklinn]] (central) district of Tallinn. Pakri islands (six inhabitants) are part of Paldiski. [[Koipsi]] and [[Rammu]] form uninhabited villages within [[Jõelähtme Parish]].

===Lakes and rivers===
The largest lakes in Harju County are [[Lake Ülemiste]] ({{cvt|9.6|km2}}) and [[Lake Harku]] ({{cvt|1.6|km2}}) in Tallinn and [[Lake Kahala]] ({{cvt|3.5|km2}}) in [[Kuusalu Parish]]. The largest artificial lake is [[Paunküla Reservoir]] ({{cvt|4.1|km2}}) in [[Kose Parish]]. The longest rivers are the [[Keila River]] ({{cvt|107|km}} in total), [[Pirita River]] ({{cvt|105|km}}), [[Jägala River]] ({{cvt|97|km}}) and [[Valgejõgi River]] ({{cvt|85|km}}). The two largest permanently active waterfalls in Estonia, [[Jägala Falls]] ({{cvt|8|m}}) and [[Keila Falls]] ({{cvt|6|m}}), are situated on these rivers.

===Geographical extremes===
*Northernmost point: [[Keri (island)|Keri]] island, [[Kelnase]] village, [[Viimsi Parish]]
**Mainland: [[Purekkari|Cape Purekkari]], [[Pärispea]] village, [[Kuusalu Parish]] (Northernmost point of mainland Estonia)
*Easternmost point: [[Kolgu]] village, [[Kuusalu Parish]]
*Southernmost point: [[Aela, Estonia|Aela]] village, [[Kose Parish]]
*Westernmost point: [[Keibu]] village, [[Lääne-Harju Parish]]
*Highest point: {{cvt|102|m}} - Määrasmägi, [[Vetla]] village, [[Anija Parish]]
*Lowest point: 0 m ([[sea level]]) - [[Baltic Sea]]

===Protected areas===
[[File:Viru Bog at winter.jpg|thumb|Viru Bog, [[Lahemaa National Park]], in winter]]
There are a number of protected areas in Harju County. [[Lahemaa National Park]] was the first [[national park]] in the [[Soviet Union]], when it was created in 1971. The park was intended for the protection of the natural and cultural heritage of the coastal landscapes of Northern Estonia. There are 21 [[nature reserve]]s and 25 landscape protection areas, that are at least partly situated in Harju County. The largest is the [[Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve]] in [[Kuusalu Parish]] and [[Anija Parish]].
