==History==
During the Middle Ages, Jilib and its surrounding area was part of the [[Ajuran Empire]] that governed much of southern [[Somalia]] and eastern [[Ethiopia]], with its domain extending from [[Hobyo]] in the north, to [[Kelafo|Qelafo]] in the west, to [[Kismayo]] in the south.<ref name="Cassanelli">Lee V. Cassanelli, ''The shaping of Somali society: reconstructing the history of a pastoral people, 1600-1900'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.102.</ref>

In the early modern period, Jilib was ruled by the [[Geledi Sultanate]]. The kingdom was eventually incorporated into [[Italian Somaliland]] [[protectorate]] in 1910 after the death of the last Sultan [[Osman Ahmed]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cassanelli |first=Lee Vincent |title=The Benaadir Past: Essays in Southern Somali History |publisher=University Microfilms International |year=1973 |page=149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JytqAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official [[Jilib District]].
