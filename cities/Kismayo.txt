'''Kismayo''' ({{langx|so|Kismaayo}}, {{langx|ar|كيسمايو}}, {{transliteration|ar|Kīsmāyū}}; {{langx|it|Chisimaio}}) is a [[port city]] in the southern [[Lower Juba]] (Jubbada Hoose) province of [[Somalia]]. It is the commercial capital of the autonomous [[Jubaland]] region.

The city is situated {{convert|528|km|abbr=off}} southwest of the capital [[Mogadishu]], near the mouth of the [[Jubba River]], where it empties into the [[Indian Ocean]]. According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the city of Kismayo had a population of around 89,333 in 2005.<ref name="docs.unocha.org">{{cite web |url=https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Somalia/UNDP-POP-RURAL-URBAN%202005.pdf |title=Regions, districts, and their populations: Somalia 2005 (draft) |website=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |access-date=2020-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728203029/https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Somalia/UNDP-POP-RURAL-URBAN%202005.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-28 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the Middle Ages, Kismayo and its surrounding area was part of the [[Ajuran Empire]] that governed much of southern [[Somalia]] and eastern [[Ethiopia]], with its domain extending from [[Hafun]] in the north, to [[Kelafo|Qelafo]] in the west, to Kismayo in the south.<ref name="Cassanelli">Lee V.

In the [[early modern period]], Kismayo was ruled by the [[Geledi Sultanate]] and by the later 1800s, the Boqow dynasty. The kingdom was eventually incorporated into [[Italian Somaliland]] in 1925/6 after the death of the last sultan, [[Osman Ahmed]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cassanelli|first=Lee Vincent|title=The Benaadir Past: Essays in Southern Somali History|publisher=University Microfilms International|year=1973|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JytqAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official [[Kismayo District]].

==History==

===Antiquity===
During antiquity. Kismayo was part of the [[Sesea|Somali city-states]] that in engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting [[Somali people|Somali]] merchants with [[Phoenicia]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemic Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Parthia|Parthian Persia]], [[Sabaeans|Saba]], [[Nabataea]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the ''[[beden]]'' to transport their cargo.<ref name="ReferenceA">Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver</ref>

===Middle Ages and the early modern period===
{{main|Ajuran Sultanate|Geledi Sultanate|Somali aristocratic and court titles}}
[[File:Muzzaffar (Mogadishu area) flag according to 1576 Portuguese map.svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Ajuran Sultanate]], an influential Somali empire that held sway over Kismayo and the larger Jubaland region during the Middle Ages.]]
The Kismayo area was originally a small fishing settlement.<ref name="Cassanelli"/>

During the [[Middle Ages]], the region came under the rule of the influential [[Ajuran Sultanate]], which utilized the Jubba River for its plantations.

After the collapse of this polity, the House of Gobroon was established and the [[Sultanate of the Geledi]] held sway over the area. The dynasty reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]], who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the Bardera wars, and Sultan [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman|Omani Empire]] to submit [[tribute]].

=== Colonial Era ===
The Italians referred to the city as ''Chisimaio''. Kismayo and the northern half of the Jubaland region were incorporated into neighboring [[Italian Somaliland]] on 30 June 1926. The colony had a total area of 87,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (33,000 sq mi), with a population of 120,000 inhabitants. Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|Northern Frontier District]] (NFD).<ref name="Ospftf">{{cite book|last=Osman|first=Mohamed Amin AH|title=Somalia, proposals for the future|year=1993|publisher=SPM|pages=1–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSsOAQAAMAAJ}}</ref>

===Somali Civil War===
{{main|Somali Civil War}}
Following the breakdown of central authority that accompanied the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in 1991, various local militias fought for control of the city, including supporters of [[Mohammed Said Hersi]] ("General Morgan"), and Col. Barre Adan Shire Hiiraale [[Somali National Front]] (SNF), later on known as the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA). As well of Col. Omar Jess' [[Somali Patriotic Movement]] (SPM). Aid worker [[Sean Devereux]] was assassinated in the city in January 1993. In March 1993, a [[United States Marine]] amphibious group arrived in the city in an attempt to keep the peace as part of the [[UNOSOM II|United Nations intervention in Somalia]]. By December 1993, General Morgan's troops controlled Kismayo, despite the presence of peacekeepers. The last UN&nbsp;troops left the city in December 1994.<ref>N.Y.

In 2006 the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU), an [[Islamism|Islamist]] organization, fought with Jubaland's inhabitants of the state the Darod Marehan (JVA). And invaded other parts of southern Somalia and promptly imposed [[Shari'a|Shari'a law]]. The Transitional Federal Government sought to re‑establish its authority, and, with the assistance of [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|Ethiopian troops]], [[African Union]] peacekeepers and air support by the United States, managed to drive out the rival ICU and solidify its rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26334.html |title=Ethiopian Invasion of Somalia |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2007-08-14 |access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref>

On January 8, 2007, as the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]] raged just south of Kismayo, the TFG relocated from its interim location in [[Baidoa]] to the nation's capital, [[Mogadishu]]. This marked the first time since the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.<ref name="Gosppsdott">[http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=558:somalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&catid=55:somalia&Itemid=79 Somalia President, Parliament Speaker dispute over TFG term] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131640/http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=558%3Asomalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&catid=55%3Asomalia&Itemid=79 |date=2011-05-14 }}</ref>

Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]], regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al‑Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. By January 2009, Al‑Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped [[African Union]] peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 – The Commission's Watch List: Somalia |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2009-05-01 |access-date=2010-06-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005900/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CUSCIRF%2C%2C%2C4a4f272bc%2C0.html |archive-date=2011-05-10 }}</ref>

In September 2012, [[Military of Somalia|Somali Army]], Ras Kamboni militiamen and Kenyan Defense Forces (KDF), all under command of the African Union Mission in Somalia [[AMISOM]], re-captured the city from the Al-Shabaab insurgents during the [[Battle of Kismayo (2012)]].<ref name="Asaftk">{{cite web|title=Somali, AMISOM forces on the outskirts of Kismayo|url=http://www.peaceau.org/uploads/amisom-press-release-30-09-2012.pdf|publisher=AMISOM|access-date=30 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/somalia/jubaland-jeopardy-uneasy-path-state-building-somalia|title=Jubaland in Jeopardy: The Uneasy Path to State-Building in Somalia|publisher=International Crises Group|date=21 May 2013}}</ref> This was a culmination to the Kenyan [[Operation Linda Nchi]] attack into Somalia which had begun late the year before.

On 12 July 2019, a car bomb and a gun attack at the [[Asasey hotel attack|Asasey hotel]] killed at least 26, including two prominent journalists and nine foreigners.

===Climate===
Kismayo has a [[hot arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), despite receiving around {{convert|375|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rainfall per year, due to the extremely high potential evapotranspiration. Weather is hot year-round, with seasonal [[monsoon]] winds and irregular rainfall with recurring droughts. The ''gu'' rains, also known as the Southwest Monsoons, begin in April and last until July producing significant fresh water and allowing lush vegetation to grow. The ''gu'' season is followed by the ''xagaa'' (hagaa) dry season.

Under the terms of the agreement, Jubaland is administered for a two-year period by a Juba Interim Administration and led by the region's incumbent president, Ahmed Mohamed Islam. The regional president serves as the chairperson of a new Executive Council, to which he appoints three deputies. Additionally, the agreement includes the integration of Jubaland's military forces under the central command of the Somali National Army (SNA), and stipulates that the Juba Interim Administration will command the regional police.<ref name="Sjgraibtie"/><ref name="Sgrtjia">{{cite news|last=Wendoson|first=Abera|title=Somalia gives recognition to Jubaland interim administration|url=http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/herald/news/3845-somalia-gives-recognition-to-jubaland-interim-administration?tmpl=component&print=1&page=|access-date=11 September 2013|newspaper=Ethiopian Herald|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130911170044/http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/herald/news/3845-somalia-gives-recognition-to-jubaland-interim-administration?tmpl=component&print=1&page=|archive-date=11 September 2013}}</ref>

===Airport===
[[File:Kismayo Airport.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kismayo Airport]].]]
Kismayo's air transportation needs are served by [[Kismayo Airport]], which is situated about 10&nbsp;km from the city. It was formerly a [[Somali Air Force]] training base. Following the outbreak of the civil war, the airport was closed down for a period of time and its infrastructure was significantly damaged. However, the facility was reopened in October 2008 by the Islamic Courts Union after undergoing some renovations.<ref>Abdulkadir Khalif, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200810061240.html Somalia: Flights Carrying Khat Banned From Kismayu Airport], 6 October 2008</ref> That same year, the airport was also renamed after Imam [[Ahmed Gurey]], a 16th‑century Somali military leader.<ref>AFP, [http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hHf2OUAlTWDaPKUUMh1cWyqOoM1Q Somalia Islamists rename Kismayo airport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011160027/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hHf2OUAlTWDaPKUUMh1cWyqOoM1Q |date=2008-10-11 }}, 6 October 2008</ref>

The Kismayo Airport was officially brought under the Juba Interim Administration in August 2013. Per agreement, management of the facility was scheduled to be transferred to the [[Federal Government of Somalia|Federal Government]] after a period of six months. Revenues and resources generated from the airport will also be earmarked for Jubaland's service delivery and security sectors as well as local institutional development.<ref name="Sjgraibtie"/>

===Roads===
Three main thoroughfares connect Kismayo to other major areas in the country. The 600&nbsp;km Highway 3 runs the length of the [[Juba Valley]]. Starting in [[Beled Hawo]], it goes through [[Garbaharey]], [[Bardera]] and [[Buale]] before finally reaching Kismayo.

A paved 528&nbsp;km freeway links the capital [[Mogadishu]] with Kismayo, passing through [[Jilib]] before turning towards the capital. A third highway extends northwest from Kismayo to [[Afmadow]], then turns toward [[Dhobley (Gedo Region)|Dhobley]] in the eastern part of the Gedo region.

In January 2015, the Interim Juba Administration launched a transport beautification and cleaning campaign in Kismayo. Part of a broader urbanization drive, the initiative includes the clearing of clogged streets and lanes, razing of illegal buildings therein, and further development of the municipal road network.<ref name="Gtpckptbibamr">{{cite news|title=The police commission of Kismayo plans to bulldoze the illegal buildings along the main roads|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=8860|access-date=18 January 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=16 January 2015}}</ref>

===Seaport===
Kismayo's large docks are situated on a [[peninsula]] on the Somali Sea coast. Formerly one of the [[Bajuni Islands]], the peninsula was connected by a narrow [[causeway]] when the modern [[Port of Kismayo]] was built in 1964 with U.S. assistance. The port served as a base for the [[Somali Navy]] as well as the [[Soviet Navy]] after the [[1969 Somali coup d'état|1969 military coup]].<ref>UPI, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E6DB173BF933A1575AC0A962948260&fta=y U.S. Will Spend $38.6 Million To Refurbish Port in Somalia], September 20, 1984</ref> In 1984, Somalia and the United States jointly refurbished the port after significant wear to the {{convert|2070|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} four-berth, marginal wharf made major renovations necessary.<ref name="stinet.dtic.mil">R.
