'''Candelaria''', officially the '''Municipality of Candelaria''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Candelaria}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Quezon]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 137,881 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the third most populous settlement of Quezon after [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena City]] and [[Sariaya, Quezon|Sariaya]].

==History==

===Foundation===
Prior to 1885, the pioneering barangays of Candelaria in its western part, Taguan (Bukal), Kinatihan and Masin were parts of the Municipality of Tiaong, while Malabanban, Mangilag and Santa Catalina in the east, were under the jurisdiction of the town of Sariaya.
Sr. Don Ciriaco Nadres, a local leader of Barangay Masinand his wife Sra. Doña Baltazara Bustamante, with the support of Don Simeon Nadres and wife Doña Everista Ona, Don Justo Argao, Don Elino de Gala, Don Apolinario Gonzales, Don Tomas Cabuñag, Don Ignacio de Ramos, Don Domingo de Alday, Don Tomas Regidor, Don Juan del Valle, Don Ambrocio Salazar, Don Buenaventura Cedeño and Don Hipolito Martinez, proposed the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. They became known as the founding families of the town.
It was on December 26, 1878, that a permit was granted by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General of the Philippine Islands]], Domingo Moriones y Murillo for the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. Its boundaries were fixed by means of a treaty signed by the notable leaders of Tiaong, Sariaya and the founding families of Candelaria.

King [[Alfonso XII]] of [[Spain]] finally approved the establishment of Candelaria as an independent town on August 5, 1879.

===American Era and Japanese Occupation===
In 1902, after the cessation of the general hostilities against the Americans, administration of Candelaria was merged with the neighboring town of Sariaya.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=402|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20402|date=May 17, 1902|title=Full Title an Act Consolidating the Municipalities of Tiaon, Dolores, Candelaria, and Sariaya in the Province of Tayabas Into Two Municipalities|accessdate=February 18, 2023}}</ref> In 1907, Candelaria was again managed independently, as a fourth-class municipality.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1721|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l40d0|date=September 20, 1907|title=An Act Increasing the Number of Municipalities in the Province of Tayabas From Twenty-four to Twenty-six, by Organizing the Barrio of Candelaria, Now a Part of Sariaya, Into a New Municipality, and Separating From Baler the Former Municipality of Casiguran, Giving the Latter the Same Territory Which It Comprised Prior to the Passage of Act Numbered Fifteen Hundred and Fifty|accessdate=February 18, 2023}}</ref> During the American regime, the town progressed by leaps and bounds. Many houses and public edifices were constructed, and commerce and industries grew, until the Japanese invasion brought a further wave of destruction.

===Candle Festival===
The town fiesta is celebrated on February 5 to honor the patron saint San Pedro Bautista. Since 2017, Rev. Msgr. Melecio Verastigue, started a dance to honor San Pedro Bautista. It is called INDAK PUGAY. A dance to honor the martyrdom of the patron saint, San Pedro Bautista.

Since 2005, Monsignor Carlos (Charles) Pedro A. Herrera, the parish priest, started his devotion to Nuestra Senora de Candelaria and honored her with a Candle Festival every February 2. The celebration was concluded with a procession through the streets of the town featuring the street dancing by the youth of the community in honor of the Blessed Virgin.  A parade of floats representing each of the 25 barangays was, also, featured during the festivities.

A project in honor of the Blessed Mother Mary that will renovate the patio of the San Pedro Bautista Parish Church had been developed on April 22, 2012.  The renovated patio will convert the current parking lot into a multi-purpose open amphitheater for use of the people of Candelaria.  It will provide a venue for children and toddlers playground, jogging/walking path, a rosary garden, a via Dolorosa, and a stage for performances complete with controlled theater lighting.  The playground will be lit with lighting standards.  The fundraising for the project will be accomplished through a 1000 Points of Light campaign where each point of light will be represented by a Candelarian or friends of Candelaria contributing Php5000 or more.  Inauguration is scheduled for February 2, 2013, CANDLE FESTIVAL celebration.  Ground breaking is targeted for August 4, 2012, ARAW NG CANDELARIA.  The community project is expecting every Candelarians around the world to step up and bring their "POINT OF LIGHT".  The SPBPC parish council for economic affairs is taking the lead with Dr. Al Cornejo at the helm.
