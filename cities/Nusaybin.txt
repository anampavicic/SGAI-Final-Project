It was under [[Babylonia]]n control until 536 BCE, when it fell to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]], and remained so until taken by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE.

==== Hellenistic period ====
The Seleucids re-founded the city as '''Antiochia Mygdonia''' ({{langx|el|Ἀντιόχεια τῆς Μυγδονίας}}), mentioned for the first time in [[Polybius]]' description of the march of [[Antiochus III the Great]] against [[Molon]] ([[Polybius]], V, 51). The Greek historian [[Plutarch]] suggested that the city was populated by descendants of [[Sparta]]ns. Around the 1st century CE, Nisibis ({{langx|he|נציבין|translit=Netzivin}}) was the home of [[Judah ben Bethera]], who founded a famous [[yeshiva]] there.<ref>Talmud, Sanhedrin 32b</ref>
[[File:Near East ancient map.jpg|thumb|The Roman Near East under [[Pompey]] in 63 BCE, showing Nisibis in Parthian territory south of Roman [[Corduene]]]]
In 67 BCE, during Rome's first war with [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], the Roman general [[Lucullus]] took Nisibis ({{Langx|hy|[[wikt:Մծբին|Մծբին]]|translit=Mtsbin}}) from the brother of [[Tigranes II|Tigranes]].<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy'', p. 139; Lee Fratantuono, ''Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror'', pp. 104–105; [[Dio Cassius]], XXXVI, 6–7; Eutropius, ''Breviarium'', 6.9.1.</ref>

Like many other cities in the [[marches]] where [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Parthia]]n powers confronted one another, Nisibis was often taken and retaken. In 115 CE, it was captured by the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]], for which he gained the name of ''Parthicus'',<ref>Dio Cassius, LXVIII, 23</ref> then lost to and regained from the [[Jewish people|Jews]] during the [[Diaspora Revolt]]. After the Romans again lost the city in 194, it was once more conquered by [[Septimius Severus]], who made it his headquarters and re-established a colony there.<ref>Dio Cassius, LXXV, 23</ref>  The [[Battle of Nisibis (217)|last battle between Rome and Parthia]] was fought in the vicinity of the city in 217.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Ross|title=The Battle of Nisibis, AD 217|journal=Ancient Warfare|date=2009|volume=3|issue=5|pages=29–35|url=https://www.academia.edu/6339870|access-date=1 April 2014|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429192410/http://www.academia.edu/6339870/The_Battle_of_Nisibis_AD_217|archive-date=29 April 2016}}</ref>

=== Late Antiquity ===
[[File:Mar Jacob Church, Nisibis.jpg|thumb|The newly excavated [[Church of Saint Jacob of Nisibis]].]]
With the fresh energy of the new [[Sassanid dynasty]], [[Shapur I]] conquered Nisibis, was driven out, and returned in the 260s. In 298, by a [[Peace of Nisibis (299)|treaty]] with [[Narseh]], the province of Nisibis was acquired by the Roman Empire.

During the Roman–Persian Wars (337–363 CE) Nisibis was unsuccessfully besieged by the [[Sassanid Empire]] thrice, in 337, 346 and 350. According to the ''[[Expositio totius mundi et gentium]]'' bronze and iron were forbidden to be exported to the Persians, but for other goods, Nisibis was the site of substantial trade across the Roman–Persian frontier.<ref name=":0" />

Upon the death of [[Constantine the Great]] in 337 CE, the Sassanid [[Shah]] [[Shapur II]] marched against Roman held Nisibis with a vast army composed of cavalry, infantry and elephants. His combat engineers raised siege works, including towers, so his archers could rain down arrows at the defenders. They also undermined the walls, dammed the [[Jaghjagh River|Mygdonius River]] and constructed dikes to direct the river against the walls. On the seventieth day of the siege, the water was released and the torrent struck the walls; entire sections of the city walls collapsed. The water passed through the city and knocked down a section of the opposite wall as well. The Persians were unable to assault the city because the approaches to the breaches were impassable due to floodwater, mud and debris. The soldiers and citizens inside the city worked all night and by dawn the breaches were closed with makeshift barriers. Shapur's assault troops attacked the breaches, but their assault was repulsed. A few days later the Persian lifted the siege.<ref>Harrel, John S. ''The Nisibis War'', pp. 75–76.</ref>

Nisibis was besieged a second time in 346 CE. The details of the second siege have not survived. Shapur besieged the city for seventy-eight days and then lifted the siege.<ref>Harrel, John S. ''The Nisibis War'', p. 82; Dodgeon and Lieu, ''The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars'', pp. 191–192.</ref>

In 350 CE, while the Roman Emperor [[Constantius II]] was engaged in a civil war against the usurper [[Magnentius]] in the West, the Persians invaded and laid siege to Nisibis for the third time. The siege lasted between 100 and 160 days. The Persian engineers tried several innovative siege technics; using the River Mygdonius to bring down a section of the walls, and creating a lake around the city and using boats with siege engines to bring down another section. Unlike the first siege, as the walls fell, Persian assault troops immediately entered the breaches supported by war elephants. Despite all this they failed to break through the breaches and the attack stalled. The Romans, experts at close-quarter combat, and supported by arrows and bolts from the walls and towers checked the assault and a sortie from one of the gates forced the Persians to withdraw. Shortly after the Persian Army, suffering heavy casualties from combat and disease, lifted the siege and withdrew.<ref>Harrel, John S. ''The Nisibis War'', pp 82–83; Dodgeon and Lieu, ''The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars'', pp. 193–206.</ref>

The Roman historian of the 4th century, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], gained his first practical experience of warfare as a young man at Nisibis under the ''[[magister equitum]]'', [[Ursicinus (magister equitum)|Ursicinus]]. From 360 to 363, Nisibis was the camp of [[Legio I Parthica]]. Because of its strategic importance on the Persian border, Nisibis was heavily fortified. Ammianus lovingly calls Nisibis the "impregnable city" (''urbs inexpugnabilis'') and "bulwark of the provinces" (''murus provinciarum'').

[[Sozomen]] writes that when the inhabitants of Nisibis asked for help because the Persians were about to invade the Roman territories and attack them, Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] refused to assist them because they were [[Christianized]], and he told them that he would not help them if they did not return to paganism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg2048/tlg001/1st1K-grc1/5.3|title=SOZOMENOS, ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY, § 5.3}}</ref>

In 363 Nisibis was ceded to the [[Sassanian Empire]] after the defeat of Julian. Before that time the population of the town was forced by the Roman authorities to leave Nisibis and move to [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]]. Emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] allowed them only three days for the evacuation. Historian Ammianus Marcellinus was again an eyewitness and condemns Emperor Jovian for giving up the fortified town without a fight. Marcellinus' point-of-view is certainly in line with contemporary Roman public opinion.

According to [[Al-Tabari]], some 12,000 [[Persian people|Persians]] of good lineage from [[Istakhr]], [[Isfahan]], and other regions settled at Nisibis in the fourth century, and their descendants were still there at the beginning of the seventh century.<ref>Iranica: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iraq-i-late-sasanid-early-islamic IRAQ i. IN THE LATE SASANID AND EARLY ISLAMIC ERAS]</ref>

The [[School of Nisibis]], founded at the introduction of Christianity into the city by ethnic Assyrians of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]],<ref name=Jonsson>{{cite book |title=The Clash of Ideologies |author=Jonsson, David J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXstU5Kt-_kC&q=school+of+nisibis+assyrian&pg=PA182 |page=181 |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=1-59781-039-8 |year=2005}}</ref> was closed when the province was ceded to the Persians. [[Ephrem the Syrian]], an Assyrian poet, commentator, preacher and defender of orthodoxy, joined the general exodus of Christians and re-established the school on more securely Roman soil at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. In the fifth century, the school became a center of [[Nestorian Christianity]], and was closed down by Archbishop Cyrus in 489. The expelled masters and pupils withdrew once more, back to Nisibis, under the care of [[Barsauma of Nisibis|Barsauma]], who had been trained at Edessa, under the patronage of Narses, who established the statutes of the new school. Those that have been discovered and published belong to Osee, the successor of Barsauma in the See of Nisibis, and bear the date 496; they must be substantially the same as those of 489. In 590, they were again modified. The monastery school was under a superior called ''Rabban'' ("master"), a title also given to the instructors. The administration was confided to a major-domo, who was steward, prefect of discipline and librarian, but under the supervision of a council. Unlike the Jacobite schools, devoted chiefly to profane studies, the School of Nisibis was above all a school of theology. The two chief masters were the instructors in reading and in the interpretation of Holy Scripture, explained chiefly with the aid of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]]. The free course of studies lasted three years, the students providing for their own support. During their sojourn at the university, masters and students led a monastic life under somewhat special conditions. The school had a tribunal and enjoyed the right of acquiring all sorts of property. Its rich library possessed a most beautiful collection of Nestorian works; from its remains Ebed-Jesus, Bishop of Nisibis in the 14th century, composed his celebrated catalogue of ecclesiastical writers. The disorders and dissensions, which arose in the sixth century in the school of Nisibis, favoured the development of its rivals, especially that of Seleucia; however, it did not really begin to decline until after the foundation of the School of [[Baghdad]] (832). Notable people associated with the school include its founder Narses; Abraham, his nephew and successor; [[Abraham the Great of Kaskhar|Abraham of Kashgar]], the restorer of monastic life; and Archbishop{{nbsp}}[[Elijah of Nisibis]].

As a fortified frontier city, Nisibis played a major role in the [[Roman-Persian Wars]]. It became the capital of the newly created province of Mesopotamia after [[Diocletian]]'s organization of the eastern Roman frontier. It became known as the "Shield of the Empire" after a successful resistance in 337–350. The city changed hands several times, and once in Sasanian hands, Nisibis was the base of operations against the Romans. The city was also one of the main crossing points for merchants, although elaborate counter-espionage safeguards were also in place.<ref>Lieu, Samuel. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nisibis-city-in-northern-mesopotamia "Nisibis"] in ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''</ref>

=== Islamic period ===
The city was taken without resistance by the forces of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] under [[Umar]] in 639 or 640. Under early Islamic rule, the city served as a local administrative centre. In 717, it was struck by an earthquake and in 927 it was [[Qarmatian invasion of Iraq|raided]] by the [[Qarmatians]]. Nisibis was captured in 942 by the Byzantine Empire but was subsequently recaptured by the [[Hamdanid dynasty]]. It was attacked by the Byzantines once again in 972. Following the Hamdanids, the city was administered by the [[Marwanids (Diyar Bakr)|Marwanids]] and the [[Uqaylid dynasty|Uqaylids]]. From the middle of the 11th century onwards, it was subjected to Turkish raids and being threatened by the [[County of Edessa]], being attacked and damaged by [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] forces under [[Tughril]] in 1043. The city nevertheless remained an important centre of commerce and transport.<ref name=islamans>{{TDV Encyclopedia of Islam | title=Nusaybin |pages=269–270 |year=2007 | volume=33 | last = Tuncel | first = Metin | url = https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/nusaybin}}</ref>

In 1120, it was captured by the [[Artuqids]] under [[Ilghazi|Necmeddin Ilgazi]], followed by the [[Zengid dynasty|Zengids]] and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]]. The city is described as a very prosperous one by the period's Arab geographers and historians, with imposing baths, walls, lavish houses, a bridge and a hospital. In 1230, the city was invaded by the [[Mongol Empire]]. Mongol sovereignty was followed by that of the [[Ag Qoyunlu]], [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Safavids]]. In 1515, it was taken by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Selim I]] thanks to the efforts of [[Idris Bitlisi]].<ref name=islamans/>

Nusaybin was a place on the transit routes of [[Syrian Jews]] leaving the country after the 1948 [[formation of Israel]] and the subsequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

===== Tensions and violence =====
In November 2013, Nusaybin's mayor, [[Ayşe Gökkan]], commenced a [[hunger strike]] to protest against the construction of a wall between Nusaybin and the neighboring [[Kurds|Kurdish]]-majority city of [[Qamishli]] in [[Syria]].

On 13 November 2015, the town was placed under a [[curfew]] by the Turkish government, and [[Ali Atalan]] and Gülser Yıldırım, two elected members of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]] from the pro-Kurdish [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP), began a hunger strike in protest.

== Economy ==
As a result of Turkish government policy to close all border crossings with the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]], the city's border with Syria (i.e. the large Syrian city of Qamishli) has been closed, with claims that the cessation in smuggling has led to a 90% rise in unemployment in the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21564870-fiercely-anti-assad-stance-turkey-taking-syria-aggravating-long-running-troubles |title=Turkey, Syria and the Kurds: South by south-east |newspaper=The Economist |date=20 October 2012 }}</ref>

== Transportation ==
Nusaybin is served by the [[European route E90|E90 roadway]] and other roads to surrounding towns. The [[Nusaybin Railway Station]] is served by two daily trains. The closest airport is [[Qamishli Airport]] five kilometers to the south, in Qamishli in Syria. The closest Turkish airport is [[Mardin Airport]], 55 kilometers northwest of Nusaybin.

== Geography ==
[[File:Mardin nusaybin ilçesine bağlı beyazsu barajından çekilen bir doğa manzarası.jpg|thumb|A nature scene taken from the Beyazsu Dam in Nusaybin]]
Nusaybin is on the north side of the Syria-Turkey border, which divides it from the city of Qamishli. The [[Jaghjagh River]] flows through both cities. The Nusaybin side of the border has a [[minefield]], with a total of some 600,000 [[landmine]]s having been set by the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] since the 1950s. Located to the east is [[Mount Judi]], which people (including [[Muslim]]s) consider to be the place where the [[Noah's Ark|ark]] of [[Noah in Islam|Nuh]] or [[Noah]] (who is regarded as a ''[[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Nabi]]'' or [[Prophet]] in [[Abrahamic religions]]) came to rest.

In early 20th century, Nusaybin was composed mostly of Arabs who came from [[Mardin]], roughly 500 Jews, and some Assyrians, totaling to 2000 people. Likewise, [[Mark Sykes]] recorded Nusaybin as a town inhabited by Chaldeans, Arabs, and Jews.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sykes |first1=Mark |title=Dar-ul-Islam: A Record of a Journey Through Ten of the Asiatic Provinces of Turkey |date=1904 |publisher=Bickers & Son |page=264}}</ref> The town was largely Arabic-speaking such that Kurdish families settling in the town eventually learned Arabic. The ethnic and linguistic demographics changed after mid-century. Jews migrated to Israel, and Assyrian population substantially decreased. After dense Kurdish migration in late 20th century, Nusaybin became a largely Kurdish-speaking and Kurdish town.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tan |first=Altan |title=Turabidin'den Berriye'ye.

A very small Assyrian population remains in the city; what remained of the Assyrian population emigrated during the height of the [[Kurdish-Turkish conflict]] in the 1990s and as a result of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|resumption of the conflict in 2016]], only one Assyrian family reportedly remained in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Son Süryaniler de göç yolunda|url=http://www.evrensel.net/haber/276451/son-suryaniler-de-goc-yolunda|publisher=Evrensel|access-date=5 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nusaybin'in son Süryani ailesi: Terk etmeyeceğiz|url=http://www.evrensel.net/haber/274717/nusaybinin-son-suryani-ailesi-terk-etmeyecegiz|publisher=Evrensel|access-date=5 May 2016}}</ref>

Nisibis ({{langx|syr|ܢܨܝܒܝܢ}}, ''Nṣibin'', later Syriac {{lang|syr|ܨܘܒܐ}}, ''Ṣōbā'') had an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishop]] from 300, founded by [[Babu (bishop)|Babu]] (died 309). [[Shapur II]] besieged the city in 338, 346, and 350, when [[Jacob of Nisibis|St Jacob or James of Nisibis]], Babu's successor, was its bishop. Nisibis was the home of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], who remained until its surrender to the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid Persians]] by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] in 363. The bishop of Nisibis was the Metropolitan Archbishop of the [[ecclesiastical province]] of [[Bit-Arbaye]]. By 410, it had six [[suffragan]] sees and as early as the middle of the 5th century was the most important episcopal see of the [[Church of the East]] after [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]]-[[Ctesiphon]]. Many of its [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] or [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] bishops were renowned for their writings, including Barsumas, Osee, Narses, Jesusyab and Ebed-Jesus. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has defined [[titular archbishopric]]s of Nisibis, for various rites – one Latin and four [[Eastern Catholic]] for particular churches ''sui iuris'', notably the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and the [[Maronite Catholic Church]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 941]</ref>

When the [[Syriac Catholic Eparchy of Hassaké]] was promoted to archiepiscopal rank, it added Nisibi to its name, becoming the [[Syriac Catholic Archeparchy of Hassaké-Nisibi]] (not Metropolitan, directly dependent on the [[Syriac Catholic Patriarch of Antioch]]).
