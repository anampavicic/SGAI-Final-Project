'''Rionegro''' ({{IPA|es|rioˈneɣɾo}}) is a [[city]] and [[Municipalities of Colombia|municipality]] in [[Antioquia Department]], [[Colombia]], located in the subregion of [[Eastern Antioquia]]. The official name of the city is '''Ciudad Santiago de Arma de Rionegro'''. Rio Negro means "Black River" in Spanish, as the city received its name  after a river that looks black because of the shadows cast by trees. The river  traverses the city and it is the most prominent geographical feature of the municipality. Rionegro is also sometimes called the ''Cuna de la democracia'' (Cradle of democracy) as it was one of the most important cities during the era of the Colombia's struggle for independence and the 1863 constitution was written in the city.

== History ==
The territory was first mentioned in 1541 by the Spanish Lieutenant [[Álvaro de Mendoza (conquistador)|Álvaro de Mendoza]]. When the Field Marshal [[Jorge Robledo]] took possession of the Valley of Aburrá, he was commissioned by Álvaro de Mendoza. According to Fray Pedro Simón, Robledo was the first [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] man who discovered the Valley of San Nicolás on 2 September  1541.

Don Juan Daza, a Spaniard of illustrious lineage, took possession of the lands sometime later, and on 8 November 1581, in agreement with the rituals of the laws of Indias, nailed his sword in the ground marking it as an inhabited place and began constructing a farm.

Immigration to Rionegro came from numerous regions of the country, including from the same provincial capital of the time, [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]] and the original ranch grew into a village and then a town in the first half of the 17th century. The chapel, [[Concatedral de San Nicolás el Magno]], consecrated to [[Saint Nicholas]] was built as early as 1642, another reason why the territory reached a greater degree of independence for religious reasons. Yet, for most part of the 18th century, Rionegro was isolated by the jungle and mountains, and its chapel being only a humble one made of straw and bahareque. In 1783, Rionegro had enough population to become like a municipality, resulting in becoming the City of Santiago de Arma de Rionegro in 1786, with administrative powers under certification of King [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]], issued in the Palace of San Idelfonso on 25 September 1786. After this event, its isolation decreased, resulting in the visit of the bishop of Popayán in 1793. After seeing the bad state and rusticity of the chapel, the bishop ordered it to be demolished and a new one was built, its inauguration taking place in 1803. Rionegro became an important town, and a new distribution of lands was made (resulting in the colonization of the south of the region).

Rionegro grew in the 19th century and was an important center during the end of the Spanish rule, and in the early years of Independence. The city then rivaled [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]] to compete for the capital of Antioquia, until the city of [[Medellín]] grew prominently and far exceeded the growth of these cities.

==Geography and climate==

The municipality of Rionegro is located in the central mountain range of the [[Andes]] in eastern Antioquia. With a total area of 196&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, is part of the sub-region of [[Eastern Antioquia]]. The city is surrounded in the north by the municipalities of [[Guarne]] and [[San Vicente, Antioquia|San Vicente]], in the east by the municipalities of [[Marinilla]] and [[El Carmen de Viboral]], in the south by the municipality of [[La Ceja (Colombia)|La Ceja]], and in the west by the municipalities of [[El Retiro, Antioquia|El Retiro]] and [[Medellin]].

The city of Rionegro is located at {{Coord|6|9|18|N|75|22|48|W|}}, at an average elevation of {{convert|2,125|m|ft|0}} above sea level. The average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] varies between {{convert|1,800|and|2,500|mm|in|0}} with an average temperature of {{convert|17|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}. Much of the land consists of volcanic ashes and soils with a high resistance to  erosion.

[[Image:Area Rural Rionegro-Colombia.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Rural Rionegro]]

The altitude of the rest of the territory varies between {{convert|2,100|and|2,600|m|ft|-1}}, and the topography is characterised by a number of small hills, some of which may rise to a greater height and slope like Cerro del Capiro, located in limits with the municipality of La Ceja. A sharper mountainous system emerges towards the West of the municipality, which becomes a physical barrier between the Valley of the Aburrá and the Plateau of Rionegro, from where the main affluents of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Negro River]] are born. The main hills of the mountainous chain that surround the Valley by Rionegro are: Alto Gordo, Alto de Amariles, Alto de Salazar o La Pilastra, Cerro Verde, Alto de Careperro, Alto de Pantanillo, Cerro Corcovado and Cerro del Capiro.

Part of the city is an [[alluvial plain]] of the Negro River and its tributaries, which also include the [[Pantanillo River]] and the gorges such as Las Palmas and Espíritu Santo y Fizebad.
Historically the Negro River divided the valley in two, with the Valley of Llanogrande and the Valley of San Nicholas. [[Hydroelectric]] companies operate in the area, and have constructed a Hydroelectric Power station at Guatapé with the [[Santa Rita Dam]]. Today the hydroelectric complex of Eastern Antioquia consists of five power stations, two of which are public companies of [[Medellín]] city.
