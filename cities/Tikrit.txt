'''Tikrit''' ({{langx|ar|تِكْرِيت|translit=Tikrīt}} {{IPA|ar|ˈtɪkriːt|}}) is a city in Iraq, located {{convert|140|km|mi|sp=us}} northwest of [[Baghdad]] and {{convert|220|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of [[Mosul]] on the [[Tigris River]]. It is the administrative center of the [[Saladin Governorate]]. {{as of|2012}}, it had a population of approximately 160,000.<ref>{{cite news |title= Iraqis – with American help – topple statue of Saddam in Baghdad |date= 9 April 2003 |work= Fox News |url= https://www.foxnews.com/story/iraqis-with-american-help-topple-statue-of-saddam-in-baghdad}}</ref>

Originally a [[Fortification|fort]] during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] empire, Tikrit became the birthplace of Muslim military leader [[Saladin]]. [[Saddam Hussein]]'s birthplace was in a modest village (13 km) south of Tikrit, which is called "[[Al-Awja]]"; for that, Saddam bore the surname ''al-Tikriti''.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|last=MacFarquhar|first=Neil|date=2003-01-05|title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: ALLEGIANCES; In Iraq's Tribes, U.S. Faces a Formidable Wild Card (Published 2003)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/05/world/threats-responses-allegiances-iraq-s-tribes-us-faces-formidable-wild-card.html|access-date=2020-11-03|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The inhabitants of this village were farmers.

==History==
===Bronze Age to Hellenistic period===
As a fort along the [[Tigris]] ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''Idiqlat''), the city is first mentioned in the ''Fall of Assyria Chronicle'' as being a refuge for the [[Babylonia]]n king [[Nabopolassar]] during his attack on the city of [[Assur]] in 615 BC.<ref>Bradford, Alfred S. & Pamela M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dY86rHCI1I8C&pg=PA48 With Arrow, Sword, and Spear: A History of Warfare in the Ancient World].'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. Accessed 18 December 2010.</ref>

Tikrit is usually identified as the [[Hellenistic]] settlement [[Birtha (Mesopotamia)|Birtha]].<ref>[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith]], ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography]]'', ''s.v.'' Birtha</ref>

===Christian presence===
Until the 6th century, Christianity within the [[Sasanian Empire]] was predominantly [[dyophysite]] under the [[Church of the East]], however, as a result of [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] missionary work, Tikrit became a major Miaphysite (Orthodox Christian) center under its first bishop, [[Ahudemmeh]], in 559.<ref name=Maas2005>{{cite book|last=Maas|first=Michael |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Justinian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AvjaThtrKYC&pg=PA260|access-date=4 July 2013|date=18 April 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-82687-7|pages=260–}}</ref> Under [[Marutha of Tikrit]], the bishopric was elevated into a [[maphrian]]ate and the city's ecclesiastical jurisdiction extended as far as Central Asia.<ref name=syriacstudies>{{cite web |title= 88- Marutha of Takrit (d. 649) |publisher= SyriacStudies.com |url= http://www.syriacstudies.com/AFSS/Syriac_Scholars_and_Writers/Entries/2008/3/22_88-_Marutha_of_Takrit_%28d._649%29.html |access-date= August 20, 2012 |archive-date= July 16, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140716004648/http://www.syriacstudies.com/AFSS/Syriac_Scholars_and_Writers/Entries/2008/3/22_88-_Marutha_of_Takrit_%28d._649%29.html |url-status= dead }}</ref>

The city remained predominantly [[Syriac Orthodox Christians (Middle East)|Syriac Orthodox Christian]] in the early centuries of [[Islam]]ic rule and gained fame as an important center of [[Assyrian people|Syriac]] and [[Arab Christians|Christian Arab]] literature. Some famous Christians from the city include its [[bishop]] [[Quriaqos of Tagrit]] who ascended to become the patriarch of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], theologians Abu Zakariya Denha and [[Abu Raita al-Takriti|Abu Raita]], and translator [[Yahya ibn Adi]].<ref name=EOI/>

From the ninth century Christians of Tikrit began to migrate northwards due to restrictive measures taken by some Muslim governors. Many settled in [[Mosul]] and villages in the [[Nineveh Plains]], especially [[Bakhdida]], as well as [[Tur Abdin]].<ref name=Rassam2005>{{cite book|last=Rassam|first=Suha|title=Christianity in Iraq: Its Origins and Development to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYC93sfHXAEC&pg=PA67|access-date=4 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|isbn=978-0-85244-633-1|pages=67–68}}</ref> The Christian community received a setback when the governor ordered the destruction of the main cathedral known popularly as the "[[Saint Ahoadamah Church, Tikrit|Green Church]]" in 1089. The maphrian and some of the Christians of Tikrit had to relocate to the [[Mor Mattai Monastery]], where a village named [[Merki, Iraq|Merki]] was established in the valley below the monastery. A later governor permitted the reconstruction of the cathedral. However, instability returned and the maphrian moved indefinitely to Mosul in 1156.<ref name=Rassam2005/>

Regardless, the city remained an important center of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] until its destruction by [[Timur]] in the late 14th century. A Christian presence has not existed in the city since the 17th century.<ref name=EOI/>
[[File:The.green.church.of.tikrit 01.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the "Green Church"]]

===Byzantine to Ottoman periods===
The town was also home to the [[Arab Christian]] tribe of Iyad. The Arabs of the town secretly assisted the Muslims when they besieged the town. The Muslims entered Tikrit in 640; it was from then considered as part of the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] province. It was later regarded as belonging to Iraq by Arab geographers.<ref name=EOI>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Gibb |first = H. A. R. |author-link= H. A. R.

Tikrit was briefly controlled by the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Nizari Ismailis]]. After a failed [[Ismaili–Seljuk wars|Seljuk campaign]] against it, the Nizaris handed it over to the local Shia Arabs there.<ref name=Lewis2011>{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Bernard |title=The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam |date=2011 |publisher=Orion |isbn=978-0-297-86333-5 |language=en}}</ref>

The Arab [[Uqaylid dynasty]] took hold of Tikrit in 1036.

[[Saladin]] was born there around 1138.<ref>Malcolm Lyons and D.E.P. Jackson, "Saladin: The Politics of the Holy War", pg. 2.</ref> The modern province of which Tikrit is the capital is named after him.

The city was devastated in 1393 by [[Timur]]. During the Ottoman period Tikrit existed as a small settlement that belonged to the [[Rakka Eyalet]]; its population never exceeded 4,000–5,000.<ref name=EOI/>

===World War I and after===
[[File:Tikrit.jpg|thumb|View of Tikrit ca. 1914]]

In September 1917, [[United Kingdom|British]] forces captured the city during a major advance against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]].

The Tikriti Jewish community was mostly gone by 1948. By the time Saddam Hussein rose to power there were only two Jewish families in the city.

The city is the birthplace of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Many senior members of the Iraqi government during his rule were drawn from Saddam's own Tikriti tribe, the [[Al-Bu Nasir (Iraqi tribe)|Al-Bu Nasir]], as were members of his [[Iraqi Republican Guard]], chiefly because Saddam apparently felt that he was most able to rely on relatives and allies of his family. The Tikriti domination of the Iraqi government became something of an embarrassment to Hussein and, in 1977, he abolished the use of surnames in Iraq to conceal the fact that so many of his key supporters bore the same surname, ''al-Tikriti'' (as did Saddam himself).<ref name="auto"/> Saddam Hussein was buried near Tikrit in his hometown of [[Al-Awja]] following his hanging on December 30, 2006.

====Iraq War of 2003 and aftermath====
In the opening weeks of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion]], many observers speculated that Saddam would return to Tikrit as his "last stronghold". The city was subjected to intense aerial bombardment meant to throw Saddam's elite Republican Guard troops out of the city. On April 13, 2003, several thousand [[U.S. Marines]] and other coalition members aboard 300 armored vehicles converged on the town, meeting little or no resistance. With the fall of Tikrit, U.S. Army Major General [[Stanley McChrystal]] said, "I would anticipate that the major combat operations are over."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/15/1050172572799.html|title=Major combat over|date=15 April 2003|publisher=[[The Age]]|access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref>

However, during the subsequent [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation]], Tikrit became the scene of a number of [[Iraqi resistance (Iraq War)|resistance]] attacks against [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|Coalition forces]]. It is commonly regarded as being the northern angle of the "[[Sunni Triangle]]" within which the resistance was at its most intense. In June 2003, [[Abid Hamid Mahmud]], Saddam Hussein's Presidential Secretary and the Ace of Diamonds on the [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|most wanted 'Deck of Cards,']] was captured in a joint raid by special operations forces and the 1st Battalion, [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry Regiment]] of 1st Brigade, [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]].

After the fall of [[Baghdad]], Saddam Hussein was in and around Tikrit. He was hidden by relatives and supporters for about six months. During his final period in hiding, he lived in a small hole just outside the town of [[ad-Dawr]], 15 kilometres (9&nbsp;mi) south of Tikrit on the eastern bank of the Tigris, a few kilometers southeast of his hometown of [[Al-Awja]] (although the story of having been found in a hole specifically has come into question as being a piece of war-time propaganda). The missions which resulted in the capture of Saddam Hussein were assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Teams of the 4th Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel [[James Hickey (soldier)|James Hickey]] of the 4th Infantry Division. The U.S. Army finally captured Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003 during [[Operation Red Dawn]].

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, [[AFN Iraq]] ("Freedom Radio") broadcast news and entertainment within Tikrit, among other locations.
[[File:DA-SD-06-13569.jpg|thumb|257x257px|The Tigris River flows in front of a residence north of Tikrit]]
On November 22, 2005, HHC [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] New York Army National Guard, handed over control of Saddam Hussein's primary palace complex in Tikrit to the governor of Saladin Province, who represented the Iraqi government, discontinuing the existence of what once was FOB Danger. The palace complex had served as a headquarter for [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 4th Infantry Division]], [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Infantry Division]], and [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]]. The palace complex now serves several purposes for the Iraqi police and army, including headquarters and jails. The U.S. military subsequently moved their operations to al Sahra Airfield, later known as [[Camp Speicher]], northwest of Tikrit.

Saddam Hussein's primary palace complex contained his own palace, one built for his mother and his sons and also included a man-made lake, all enclosed with a wall and towers. Plans for the palace grounds when originally returned to the Iraqi people included turning it into an exclusive and lush resort. However, within weeks of turning over the palace, it was ravaged, and its contents, (furniture, columns, even light switches), were stolen and sold on the streets of Tikrit.

The 402nd Civil Affairs Detachment of the U.S. Army, and the government of Salah ad Din province, began plans to improve local economic conditions. One of the many projects they are working on is building an industrial vocational school in the Tikrit area. The school will teach local people skills in different fields of technology, which will help to build and improve Iraq's economic stability.<ref name=defend>{{cite web|url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/jul2006/a071806wm1.html|title=New Vocational School and Textile Mill Boost Economy - DefendAmerica News Article<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=defendamerica.mil|access-date=1 April 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613014831/http://defendamerica.mil/articles/jul2006/a071806wm1.html|archive-date=13 June 2007}}</ref> The curriculum will educate men and women in multiple occupational fields such as the production of high-tech products, plastic production technology, masonry, carpentry, petroleum equipment maintenance and repair, farm machinery and automotive repair. This self-supporting educational institution owns a textile mill where many of the graduates will work producing uniforms. The mill is scheduled to begin producing and selling products within the year, with the profits from the mill going to fund the school. The vocational school's operation, support and funding are modeled after a system South Korea used in another part of Iraq.<ref name=defend/>

On April 18, 2010, [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]] and [[Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi]] were killed in a raid {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|0}} southwest of Tikrit in a safe house.<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 19, 2010|title=Al Qaeda's two top Iraq leaders killed in raid|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-violence-alqaeda-idUSTRE63I3CL20100419|website=Reuters}}</ref>
