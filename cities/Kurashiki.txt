==History==
The Kurashiki area is part of ancient [[Bitchū Province]] and near the center of the ancient [[Kingdom of Kibi]]. Records of human settlements date back to the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, more than 20,000 years ago, and the city has numerous National Historic Sites from [[Jōmon period]] [[midden|shell middens]], [[Yayoi period]] settlement remains, [[Kofun period]] [[kofun|burial mounds]] and [[Nara period]] temple ruins. From the [[Heian period]], the estuary of the Takahashi River was a port, and the surrounding area was the setting for numerous battles.

During the [[Edo Period]], the area had a complicated administration, with portions held by various feudal domains. The old town of Kurashiki and its port was held directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] as ''[[tenryō]]'' territory and was a collection point for the annual rice taxes. Distinctive white-walled, black-tiled warehouses were built to store goods.  The Kurashiki magistrate's office recognized the autonomy of the merchants and gave preferential treatment to them, resulting in an increase in the population as well as increased ''[[kokudaka]],'' and local industries included cotton cloth weaving and salt production.

Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the village of Kurashiki was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on June 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on April 1, 1891 and to city status April 1, 1928.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.city.kurashiki.okayama.jp/kankou/JAPANESE%20STYLE/jp_style/CITY/history.html|publisher=City of Kurashiki|title=Kurashiki's History|date=August 7, 2006|access-date=August 8, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119204959/http://www.city.kurashiki.okayama.jp/kankou/JAPANESE%20STYLE/jp_style/CITY/history.html|archive-date=January 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On August 1, 2005, the town of [[Mabi, Okayama|Mabi]] (from [[Kibi District, Okayama|Kibi District]]), and the town of [[Funao, Okayama|Funao]] (from [[Asakuchi District, Okayama|Asakuchi District]]) were merged with Kurashiki.

Kurashiki is the home of Japan's first museum for [[Western culture|Western art]], the [[Ohara Museum of Art]]. Established in 1930 by [[Magosaburō Ōhara]], it contains paintings by [[El Greco]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]. The collection also presents fine examples of Asian and contemporary art. The main building is designed in the style of [[Neoclassicism]].

The old merchant quarter is called the Bikan historical area. It contains many fine examples of 17th century wooden warehouses (''kura'', 倉) painted white with traditional black tiles, along a canal framed with weeping willows and filled with ''[[koi]]''. The area has no electric poles in order to make it more closely resemble the look of the Meiji period. One of the city's former town halls was located in the Kurashiki Kan, a European style building constructed in 1917.

In 1997 a theme park called ''Tivoli'' (after the [[Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen|park of the same name]] in [[Copenhagen]]) opened near Kurashiki Station. After ten years of operation it was closed in 2008, with a massive debt.

The [[Great Seto Bridge]] connects the city to [[Sakaide, Kagawa|Sakaide]] in [[Kagawa Prefecture]] across the Inland Sea.
