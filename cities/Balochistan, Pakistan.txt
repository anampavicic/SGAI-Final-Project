Located in the [[Geography of Pakistan|southwestern region]] of the country, Balochistan is the largest province of Pakistan by land area but is the [[Demographics of Pakistan|least populated one]]. It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] to the north-east, [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] to the east and [[Sindh]] to the south-east; shares international borders with [[Pakistan-Iran border|Iran]] to the west and [[Durand line|Afghanistan]] to the north; and is bound by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south. Balochistan is an extensive [[plateau]] of rough terrain divided into basins by ranges of sufficient heights and ruggedness. It has the world's largest deep sea port, [[Gwadar Port|the Port of Gwadar]] lying in the Arabian Sea.

Although it makes up about 44% of the land area of Pakistan, only 5% of it is arable and it is noted for an extremely dry [[desert climate]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{Cite news |title=Balochistan {{!}} province, Pakistan |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Balochistan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173533/https://www.britannica.com/place/Balochistan |archive-date=5 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="Government of Balochistan">{{Cite web |title=Livestock at a glance |url=https://balochistan.gov.pk/expo-livestock-2019/livestock-at-a-glance/ |access-date=2023-01-26 |website=Government of Balochistan |language=en-US}}</ref> Despite this, agriculture and livestock make up about 47% of Balochistan's economy.<ref name="Government of Balochistan" />

The name "[[Balochistan#Etymology|Balochistan]]" means "the land of the [[Baloch people|Baloch]]". Largely underdeveloped, its [[Economy of Balochistan, Pakistan|economy]] is also dominated by natural resources, especially its [[Oil and Gas Development Company|natural gas fields]].

===Early history===
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:IVC-major-sites-2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Map showing the sites and extent of the [[Indus Valley civilisation]]. [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and [[Mehrgarh]] were among the centres of the Indus Valley Civilisation in the modern-day province.

Balochistan occupies the very southeasternmost portion of the [[Iranian plateau]], the setting for the earliest known farming settlements in the pre-[[Indus Valley civilisation]] era, the earliest of which was [[Mehrgarh]], dated at 7000 BCE,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Archaeology of Measurement: Comprehending Heaven, Earth and Time in Ancient Societies|author1=Iain Morley|author2=Colin Renfrew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzrNgAsJY1MC&q=mehgrah+BCE&pg=PA107|page=107|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521119900}}</ref> within the province. Balochistan marked the westernmost extent of civilisation. Centuries before the arrival of [[Islam]] in the seventh century, parts of Balochistan were ruled by the [[Paratarajas]], an [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian]] dynasty. At certain times, the [[Kushans]] also held political sway in parts of Balochistan.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The local tradition attributes the origin of this name to Rani Sewi of the Sewa dynasty which ruled this part of the country in ancient times.}}</ref>

===Arrival of Islam===
In 654, Abdulrehman ibn Samrah, governor of Sistan and the newly emerged [[Rashidun caliphate]] at the expense of Sassanid Persia and the [[Byzantine Empire]], sent an Islamic army to crush a revolt in [[Zaranj]], which is now in southern Afghanistan. After conquering Zaranj, a column of the army pushed north, conquering [[Kabul]] and [[Ghazni]], in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range, while another column moved through [[Quetta District]] in north-western Balochistan and conquered the area up to the ancient cities of ''Dawar'' and ''Qandabil'' ([[Bolan District|Bolan]]).<ref>Tabqat ibn Saad, Vol. 8, p. 471</ref> It is documented that the major settlements, falling within today's province, became in 654 controlled by the Rashidun caliphate, except for the well-defended mountain town of ''QaiQan'' which is now [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]].

===Pre-modern era===
In the 15th century, [[Mir Chakar Khan Rind]] became the first [[Sirdar]] of Afghan, Iranian and Pakistani Balochistan. He was a close aide of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ruler [[Humayun]], and was succeeded by the [[Khanate of Kalat]], which owed allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Later, [[Nader Shah]] won the allegiance of the rulers of eastern Balochistan.

Gwadar, a region of Balochistan, was a colony of Oman for more than a century, and in the 1960s Pakistan took over the land. Many people in this region are therefore Omani.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1489531/world |title=Arab legacy lingers as Pakistan's Gwadar grows from tiny fishing town into port city |date=29 April 2019 |website=Arab News}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Astola Island.jpg|thumb|[[Astola Island]]]]
Balochistan is situated in the southwest of Pakistan and covers an area of {{convert|347190|km2|mi2}}. It is Pakistan's largest province by area, constituting 44% of Pakistan's total landmass. The province is bordered by [[Afghanistan]] to the north and north-west, Iran to the south-west, [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] to the north-east. To the south lies the [[Arabian Sea]]. Balochistan is located on the south-eastern part of the Iranian plateau. It borders the geopolitical regions of the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Balochistan lies at the mouth of the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and provides the shortest route from seaports to Central Asia. Its geographical location has placed the otherwise desolate region in the scope of competing for global interests for all of recorded history.

The capital city Quetta is located in a densely populated portion of the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in the northeast of the province. It is situated in a river valley near the Bolan Pass, which has been used as the route of choice from the coast to Central Asia, entering through Afghanistan's [[Kandahar]] region. The British and other historic empires have crossed the region to invade Afghanistan by this route.<ref>Bolan Pass – Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition</ref>

Balochistan is rich in exhaustible and renewable resources; it is the second major supplier of natural gas in Pakistan. The province's renewable and human resource potential has not been systematically measured or exploited. Local inhabitants have chosen to live in towns and have relied on sustainable water sources for thousands of years.

===Climate===
The climate of the upper highlands is characterised by very cold winters and hot summers. In the lower highlands, winters vary from extremely cold in northern districts [[Ziarat]], Quetta, Kalat, Muslim Baagh and Khanozai, where temperatures can drop to {{convert|-20|C|F}}, to milder conditions closer to the Makran coast. Winters are mild on the plains, with temperatures never falling below freezing point. Summers are hot and dry, especially in the arid zones of Chagai and Kharan districts. The plains are also very hot in summer, with temperatures reaching {{convert|50|C|F}}. The record highest temperature, {{convert|53|C|F}}, was recorded in Sibi on 26 May 2010,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pakmet.com.pk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902112830/http://www.pakmet.com.pk/latest%20news/Latest%20News.html |url-status=dead |title=Pakmet.com.pk – Pakistan's Biggest Property Website |archive-date=2 September 2010 |website=PakMet}}</ref> exceeding the previous record, {{convert|52|C|F}}. Other hot areas include [[Turbat]] and [[Dalbandin]]. The desert climate is characterised by hot and very arid conditions. Occasionally, strong windstorms make these areas very inhospitable.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Balochistan, Pakistan|List of districts in Balochistan, Pakistan|List of cities in Balochistan}}
In common with the other provinces of Pakistan, Balochistan has a parliamentary form of government. The ceremonial head of the province is the [[Governor of Balochistan (Pakistan)|Governor]], who is appointed by the [[President of Pakistan]] on the advice of the provincial [[Chief Minister of Balochistan|Chief Minister]]. The Chief Minister, the province's chief executive, is normally the leader of the largest political party or alliance of parties in the provincial assembly.

[[File:Governor's House, Quetta, side view.jpg|thumb|Balochistan Governor House Quetta]]

The [[unicameral]] [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan]] comprises 65 seats of which 11 are reserved for women and 3 reserved for non-Muslims. The judicial branch of government is carried out by the [[Balochistan High Court]], which is based in Quetta and headed by a Chief Justice.

Besides dominant Pakistan-wide political parties (such as the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]], [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]), Balochistan nationalist parties (such as the [[National Party (Pakistan)|National Party]] and the [[Balochistan National Party (Mengal)]]) have been prominent in the province.<ref name="Hussain-4-25-13"/>

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:Divisions of Balochistan.jpg|thumb|'''Divisions of Balochistan''']]
[[File:Balochistan Districts.svg|thumb|'''Note:''' In this map, Lehri is shown within Sibi District on #27. Sohbatpur and Usta Muhammad is shown within Jafarabad District on #8.Hub is shown within Lasbela District on #17.]]

For administrative purposes, the province is divided into seven divisions: [[Kalat Division|Kalat]], [[Makran Division|Makran]], [[Nasirabad Division|Nasirabad]], [[Quetta Division|Quetta]], [[Sibi Division|Sibi]], [[Zhob Division|Zhob]] and [[Rakhshan Division|Rakhshan]]. This divisional level was abolished in 2000, but restored after the 2008 election. Each division is under an appointed commissioner. The seven divisions are further subdivided into 36 districts:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=49 |title=Districts |publisher=Government of Balochistan |access-date=13 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807000609/http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=49 |archive-date= 7 August 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1440719 |title=New districts |website=Dawn |date=23 October 2018}}</ref>

As of June 2021, there are eight divisions.

Balochistan's population density is low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. In March 2012, preliminary census figures showed that the population of Balochistan, not including the districts of Khuzdar, Kech and Panjgur, had reached 13,162,222, an increase of 139.3% from 5,501,164 in 1998. The population constituted 6.85% of Pakistan's total population. This was the largest increase in population in any province of Pakistan during that time period, almost thrice the national increase of 46.9%.<ref name="POP">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pak-population-increased-by-46-9-between-1998-and-2011/articleshow/12453387.cms|title=Pak population increased by 46.9% between 1998 and 2011|work=The Times of India|date=29 March 2012 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129125417/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pak-population-increased-by-46-9-between-1998-and-2011/articleshow/12453387.cms|archive-date=29 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=census1998>{{cite web |title=Population, Area and Density by Region/Province |year=1998 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Statistics, Government of Pakistan 2009 |url=http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/publications/yearbook2008/Population/16-5.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118145343/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/publications/yearbook2008/Population/16-5.pdf}}</ref><ref name="2012Census1">{{cite web |title=Population shoots up by 47 percent since 1998 |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date=29 March 2012 |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-13514-Population-shoots-up-by-47-percent-since-1998 |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701193658/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-13514-Population-shoots-up-by-47-percent-since-1998}}</ref> Official estimates of Balochistan's population grew from approximately 7.45 million in 2003 to 7.8 million in 2005.<ref name=worldbankpop>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf Pakistan Balochistan Economic Report: From Periphery to Core (In Two Volumes) – Volume II: Full Report.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501074227/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf |date=1 May 2011 }} The World Bank.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Balochistan, Pakistan}}
The economy of Balochistan is largely based upon agriculture, livestock, fisheries, production of natural gas, coal and other minerals.<ref name="Ethnic Subnationalist Insurgencies in South Asia: Identities, Interests and Challenges to State Authority">{{cite book |last1=Chima |first1=Jugdep S. |title=Ethnic Subnationalist Insurgencies in South Asia: Identities, Interests and Challenges to State Authority |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1138839922 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x8sqBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA126 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230731/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x8sqBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA126 |archive-date=20 March 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Though agriculture and livestock play a dominant role in the provincial economy by contributing 47% of its GDP, it faced intense damages due to the [[2022 Pakistan floods]]. The floods killed around 500,000 of Balochistan's livestock and damaged cultivation and agricultural output in 32 out of 35 districts of the province. The [[Lasbela District|Lasbela district]] was the worst hit as the floods washed away fourt-fifth's of the homes, crops and livestock.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The post-floods mental health crisis in Balochistan |date=26 January 2023 |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1732645}}</ref> Due to the floods and severe drought conditions, the province faces food insecurity and is 85% dependent on the [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces for the supply of wheat.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-01-09 |title=Amid wheat crisis, Quetta residents protest delay in provision of subsidized flour |url=https://arab.news/p84b6 |access-date=2023-01-31 |website=Arab News PK |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Pakistan crisis: Stampedes reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan as flour crisis worsens |url=https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/world/story/pakistan-crisis-stampedes-reported-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-balochistan-as-flour-crisis-worsens-359565-2023-01-10 |access-date=2023-01-31 |website=Business Today |date=10 January 2023 |language=hi}}</ref>
