==Etymology==
Taizhou's name is believed to derive from nearby [[Tiantai Mountain|Mount Tiantai]].

==History==
[[File:灵江.JPG|200px|thumb|Ancient City Wall of Linhai]]
Five thousand years ago, the ancestors of the modern inhabitants began to settle in this area. During the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], when the [[ancient China|Chinese state]] was largely confined to the [[Yellow River]] basin, the area of present-day Taizhou was part of [[Dong'ou Kingdom|Dong'ou]]. Following the 3rd-century&nbsp;BC conquests of the [[Qin Empire]], a settlement in the area was known as Huipu Town. It was initially included in the [[Minzhong Prefecture]], but then moved to [[Kuaiji Prefecture|Kuaiji]] during the [[Han dynasty|Han]].

On August 22, 1994, Taizhou Municipality was set up in place of Taizhou Prefecture and approved by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. In 1999, Taizhou was approved by the State Council to be a leading city in Zhejiang's [[urbanization]] structure and the center of sub zone of the first-class economy. Approved by the National Development and Reform Commission, Taizhou formally became one of the 16 cities of [[Yangtze River]] Delta area on Aug.15, 2003.

==Demographics==
At the time of 2010 census, the whole population of Taizhou, including the whole [[prefecture-level city]] and subsidiary counties was 5,968,838 with 3,269,304 in the emerging built-up area made of 3 urban districts, [[Jiaojiang]], [[Huangyan District|Huangyan]], [[Luqiao]] and Wenling City largely being urbanized.

==Administration==

The [[prefecture-level city]] of Taizhou currently administers 3 [[District (PRC)|districts]], 3 [[county-level cities]] and 3 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]].

==Infrastructure and transport==
[[File:20211003 台州西站 站前广场.jpg|thumb|left|[[Taizhou West railway station|Taizhou West Railway Station]], completed in 2009]]

Historically, Taizhou was relatively inaccessible by road. This has changed due to large infrastructure restructuring in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Presently, Taizhou is served by the {{ill|S1 Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou Expressway|zh|甬台温高速公路}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|甬台温高速公路}}), which is a segment in the north–south [[G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway]], linking the city with [[Ningbo]], [[Shanghai]] in the north and [[Wenzhou]] in the south; the [[Shangsan Expressway]] links Taizhou with the provincial capital [[Hangzhou]]. [[Taizhou Luqiao Airport]] was once named [[Huangyan Luqiao Airport]] (IATA:HYN) in the city's Luqiao District serves daily flights to [[Beijing]] and [[Chengdu]] and regular flights to other major Chinese cities.

In September 2009, the high-speed [[Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou railway]] opened. There are several stations in the prefecture boundaries of Taizhou. The station serving the urban core is in Huangyan District and is called [[Taizhou West railway station|Taizhou railway station]]. A second line, the [[Hangzhou–Taizhou high-speed railway]], opened in January 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=China's first privately-owned high-speed railway begins operation between Hangzhou and Taizhou - PR Newswire APAC |url=https://en.prnasia.com/releases/apac/china-s-first-privately-owned-high-speed-railway-begins-operation-between-hangzhou-and-taizhou-349024.shtml |website=en.prnasia.com |publisher=haiwainet.cn |access-date=21 December 2023 |location=Hangzhou, China |language=en-us |date=19 January 2022}}</ref> [[Taizhou Central railway station]] on the line will serve [[Jiaojiang District]].

The first line of [[Taizhou Rail Transit]] opened in December 2022.

==Language and culture==
Like the majority of areas in Zhejiang, most people from Taizhou speak a dialect of [[Wu Chinese]], known as [[Taizhou Wu]]. It is not [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Mandarin Chinese]], and only partially intelligible with [[Shanghainese]]. There is also a small portion of [[Min Nan]] and [[Wenzhou dialect]] speakers in the southern regions. None of these three languages are mutually intelligible amongst each other, but the linguistic diversity of some regions has resulted in a segment of the population becoming fluent in speaking up to four languages, when Mandarin is included.

The city's people are reputed to be industrious and business-minded, although not to the same degree as neighboring [[Wenzhou]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Many people from the area have migrated abroad after economic reforms began in China in 1978. The city's [[seafood]] is of note.
