'''Bahia''' ({{IPA|pt|baˈiɐ|lang|Pt-br Bahia.ogg}}) is one of the 26 [[Federative units of Brazil|states of Brazil]], located in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]] of the country. It is the fourth-largest Brazilian state by population (after [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]) and the 5th-largest by area. Bahia's capital is the city of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] (formerly known as "Cidade do São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos", literally "City of the Saint Savior of the Bay of All the Saints"), on a [[Spit (landform)|spit]] of land separating the [[Bay of All Saints]] from the Atlantic. Once a stronghold of supporters of direct rule of Brazil by the Portuguese monarchy, and dominated by [[Agriculture in Brazil|agricultural]], [[Slavery in Brazil|slaving]], and ranching interests, Bahia is now a predominantly [[Working class|working-class]] industrial and agricultural state. The state is home to 7% of the Brazilian population<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2019-08/estimativa-da-populacao-do-brasil-passa-de-210-milhoes-diz-ibge|title=Estimativa da população do Brasil passa de 210 milhões, diz IBGE|date=Aug 28, 2019|website=Agência Brasil|access-date=Aug 5, 2020|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819031636/https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2019-08/estimativa-da-populacao-do-brasil-passa-de-210-milhoes-diz-ibge|url-status=live}}</ref> and produces 4.2% of the country's GDP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibge.gov.br/explica/pib.php|title=Produto Interno Bruto - PIB &#124; IBGE|website=www.ibge.gov.br|access-date=Aug 5, 2020|archive-date=August 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200815134708/https://www.ibge.gov.br/explica/pib.php|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/o-que-e-que-eu-faco-sophia/descubra-quais-sao-os-15-estados-mais-ricos-do-brasil-15122019 |title=quais são os 15 Estados mais ricos do Brasil |date=15 December 2019 |access-date=2021-03-20 |archive-date=2021-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214120926/https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/o-que-e-que-eu-faco-sophia/descubra-quais-sao-os-15-estados-mais-ricos-do-brasil-15122019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.terra.com.br/economia/infograficos/pib-estados/ |title=Economist' compara economia de Estados do Brasil com países |access-date=2021-03-20 |archive-date=2021-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124102005/https://www.terra.com.br/economia/infograficos/pib-estados/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibge.gov.br/cidades-e-estados |title=dos estados e cidades do Brasil |access-date=2021-03-20 |archive-date=2021-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625142600/https://www.ibge.gov.br/cidades-e-estados/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibge.gov.br/apps/populacao/projecao/ |title=dos estados do Brasil |access-date=2021-03-20 |archive-date=2017-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918103229/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2011/POP2011_DOU.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==<span class="anchor" id="Etymology"></span>Name==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2024}}

The name of the state derives from the earlier [[captaincy of Bahia de Todos os Santos]], named for [[#Bay of All Saints|Bay of All Saints]] (''{{lang|pt|Baía de Todos os Santos}}'' in [[modern Portuguese]]), a major feature of [[Brazilian coast|its coastline]]. The bay itself was named by the [[Portuguese explorer|explorer]] [[Amerigo Vespucci]] during [[Second voyage of Amerigo Vespucci|his second voyage]], when he found it on [[All Saints' Day]] (1 November), 1502. He named it after his [[parish church]] in [[Florence]], [[Ognissanti, Florence|San Salvatore di Ognissanti]] ("[[Jesus Christ|Holy Savior]] of All the [[Saint (Catholicism)|Saints]]"). Over time, the bay became distinguished as the Bay of All Saints, the state as Bahia ("Bay"), and its capital first as Bahia and then finally as [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

== Geography ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2024}}

Bahia is bordered on the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[#Bay of All Saints|Bay of All Saints]] is the largest bay on the Brazilian coast. Under the [[Brazilian Empire]], it was bounded on the north by the [[Real River (Brazil)|Rio Real]] and by the [[Jequitinhonha River|Jequitinhonha]] on the south,<ref>{{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bahia (1.) |volume=3 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |pages=239–240 }}</ref> but Bahia now comprises an irregular shape bound by other [[states of Brazil]], some of which were formed from it. In the north, it is now bordered (from east to west) by [[Sergipe]], [[Alagoas]], [[Pernambuco]] and [[Piauí]]. In the northwest, it is bordered by [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]]. In the southwest, it borders [[Goiás]], and in the south it is bordered (from east to west) by [[Espírito Santo]] and [[Minas Gerais]].

The state is crossed from west to east by [[list of rivers of Bahia|many rivers]], but the most important is the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], which starts in [[Minas Gerais]] and runs through western Bahia before emptying into the Atlantic between [[Sergipe]] and [[Alagoas]]. Formerly plied by [[paddlewheel steamer]]s, the river is only navigable to small modern craft but is still vital to the arid west since it continuously supplies water during seasons. The [[Sobradinho Dam]] created one of the largest reservoirs in the world; other major hydroelectric projects along its length include the [[Paulo Afonso Hydroelectric Complex]] and the Itaparica or [[Luiz Gonzaga Dam]].

===Regions===
[[File:Belezas_da_Chapada_Diamantina_13.JPG|thumb|right|Chapada Diamantina National Park]]

Bahia's geographical regions comprise the [[Atlantic Forest]]; the maritime region (''Recôncavo''){{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} radiating from the Bay of All Saints, the site of [[sugar]] and [[tobacco]] cultivation; and the ''{{lang|pt|Planalto}}'', which includes the ''{{lang|pt|[[sertão]]}}'' region of Bahia's far interior. The state has the [[#Diamantina Tableland|Diamantina Tableland]] (''{{lang|pt|Chapada Diamantina}}''), which divides it into two distinct geographical zones. The rain falls regularly in the eastern section.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The western area is more arid{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} and its predominate vegetation the ''{{lang|pt|[[cerrado]]}}''. The natural aridity was greatly worsened over the 19th century by the cowboys' habit of starting wildfires each year to improve the quality of the grass.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |last=Lamoureaux |first=Andrew Jackson |wstitle=Bahia (state) |volume=3 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |page=210 }}</ref> The [[Chapada Diamantina National Park]] is home to picturesque ''{{lang|pt|chapadões}}''.

====Coconut Coast====
The Coconut Coast, in the north of Bahia, corresponds to a total of {{convert|193|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline, where coconut groves, dunes, rivers, swamps and fresh water lagoons are abundant as well as the presence of the [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic Rain Forest]]. The Green Road, a road that connects Mangue Seco in the far north to Praia do Forte, crosses this region maintaining a critical distance from the areas of environmental preservation. For this reason, the route is sometimes more than {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the beach. At Praia do Forte, the road meets the Coconut Road (Estrada do Côco) leading to Salvador, passing through spots, which are now integrated in the urban development of the state capital. In this region is located [[Deputado Luís Eduardo Magalhães International Airport]].<ref>Rogério Carlos Borges de Oliveira,  "Does inclusive tourism reduce poverty?: evidence from the programme on the Coconut Coast in Brazil." (Geneva, Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, 2009) </ref>

====Bay of All Saints====
{{main|Bay of All Saints}}

The largest bay on the [[Brazilian coast]], the [[Bay of All Saints]] (''{{lang|pt|Bahia de Todos os Santos}}'') has a large number of islands with tropical beaches and vegetation. In its 1,052 square km, it contains 56 islands, receives fresh water from numerous rivers and creeks (especially the Paraguaçú and Subaé) and bathes the first capital of Brazil and the largest in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]], Salvador, and more than ten municipalities. It is the largest navigable bay in Brazil and one of the most favorite spots for nautical sports, due to its regular breezes, medium annual temperature of {{convert|26|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and sheltered waters. The bay offers various leisure options, with hundreds of vessels of all different types, especially saveiros, schooners, motor boats, jet ski that criss-cross its crystalline waters on maritime excursions to the islands, and boat races. Events and sport activities occur throughout the year, beginning on 1 January, with the Procession of Bom Jesus dos Navegantes greeting the New Year.

All Saints' has also been traditionally the venue for rowing contests at the Enseada dos Tainheiros, in Salvador and now the bay is included in the routes of the great international [[regatta]]s, such as the Ralley Les Iles du Soleil, regatta Hong Kong Challenge and the Expo 98 Round the World Rally, which consider the bay an important stop along the route. The islands of the bay are a separate attraction. Some are privately owned, others were declared a state heritage and transformed into Environmental Protection Areas or ecological stations. Other islands are the patrimony of 12 municipalities located around the bay. Only a few are uninhabited and many have small communities where the natives live on fishing and tourism. All have common characteristics, such a calm sea, dense vegetation, especially [[coconut]]s and [[banana]]s, as well as vestiges of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. Of the 56 islands, the most important are [[Itaparica]], Madre de Deus, Maré, Frades, Medo, Bom Jesus dos Passos.

====<span class="anchor" id="Dende Coast"></span> Dendê Coast====
The Dendê Coast, south of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], is surrounded by verdant vegetation, clear waters, islands, bays, coral reefs and a very diversified [[fauna]]. The name of the area refers to the cultivation of the [[palm oil]], or ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]'', likely imported from West Africa. It is connected to Salvador and the southern part of the state by ferryboats and the BA-001 highway, the second ecological highway along the Bahian coast, which connects the southern coastline and the extreme southern part of the state. It includes the municipalities of Valença, Cairu and the International attractions of Morro de São Paulo, [[Camamu]], Taperoá, Igrapiúna, Ituberá and Maraú. The mouth of the [[Una River (Valença, Bahia)|Rio Una]], in the form of a [[river delta|delta]], contains 26 islands, the largest of which is [[Ilha de Tinharé]], where the Morro de São Paulo is located. At Boipeba and Cairú, which are part of the archipelago of Tinharé, the diversity of the ecosystems enables visitors to practice [[water sport]]s, walk along the beach, follow trails in the [[rainforest]] and bathe on completely deserted beaches such as Garapuá.<ref name="GohWong2017">{{cite book|last1=Goh|first1=KJ |last2=Wong|first2=C.K.|last3=Ng|first3=P.H.C.|title=Encyclopedia of Applied Plant Sciences |chapter=Oil Palm|year=2017|pages=382–390|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-394807-6.00176-3|isbn=9780123948083 }}</ref>

====Cacao Coast====
Along the southern coast of Bahia, the Cacao Coast preserves ecological sanctuaries with dozens of kilometers of beaches shaded by dense coconut groves, the [[Atlantic Forest]], large areas of wetland vegetation and [[cacao plantation]]s. Walking along paths in the forest or along the beaches, horseback riding along the coast, boat trips up the vast number of rivers are some of the options that the region offers. Here one can find Environmental Protection Areas at Itacaré/Serra Grande and the Lagoa Encantada in [[Ilhéus]], the Biological Reserve of Una and the Ecological Reserve of Prainha at Itacaré. From the Morro de Pernambuco to Canavieiras, there are {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} of beaches, with [[reef]]s, [[inlet]]s, [[coconut]] grove and an infinite number of estuaries of rivers which extend throughout the Cacao Coast. Highway BA-001 links the municipalities, nearly always bordering the coastline. The most important locations at Cacao Coast are: Itacaré, Ilhéus, and Olivença.

====Discovery Coast====
[[File:Bahia Köppen.svg|right|thumb|Köppen climate types of Bahia]]
The Discovery Coast preserves, virtually intact, the landscape seen by the Portuguese fleet described in the first pages of the [[history of Brazil]]. There are approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} of beaches, inlets, bays, cliffs, numerous rivers and streams surrounded by the verdant [[coconut]] groves, wetlands and the [[Atlantic Forest]]. There are various types of water sports, walks, trips on horseback, surfing and deep sea diving trips available. Recife de Fora, Coroa Alta and Trancoso can be reached in one day schooner excursions. BA-001 and two [[ferryboat]] systems over the Rio João de Tiba and Rio Buranhém connect the municipalities with the coast. Trips from Barra do Cai, passing through the Parque Nacional do Monte Pascoal, Caraíva, Trancoso, Arraial d'Ajuda, the environmental protection areas of Santo Antônio and Coroa Vermelha, to the mouth of the Rio João de Tiba as far as the Rio Jequitinhonha are among the various ecological trips available.

====Diamantina Tableland====
{{main|Chapada Diamantina}}
The geographical center of Bahia is the Diamantina Tableland (''{{lang|pt|Chapada Diamantina}}'') region. It is a mountainous region with diversified topography. 90% of the rivers of the Paraguaçu, Jacuípe, and Rio das Contas [[drainage basin|basin]]s have their source here. There are thousands of kilometers of clear waters that spring from these mountains and descend in cascades and waterfalls to plateaus and plains, forming natural pools. The vegetation mixes cactus species of the caatinga dry lands with rare examples of the mountain [[flora]], especially [[bromeliad]]s, [[orchid]]s and "sempre vivas" (member of the strawflower family). On the area one, can find the three highest mountains in the state: Pico do Barbado, {{convert|2080|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, Pico Itobira, {{convert|1970|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and Pico das Almas, {{convert|1958|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Another scenic attraction is the [[Cachoeira da Fumaça]] ("Waterfall"), which falls {{convert|420|m|ft|abbr=on}}; the Gruta dos Brejões, the largest cavern opening of Bahia; and the [[Poço Encantado]]. Many of the sites are protected by the National Park of the Diamantina Tableland and the Environmental Preservation Area Serra do Barbado and Marimbus, Iraquara.

===Climate===
Bahia's climate is tropical. It has the longest coastline of the country: 1,103&nbsp;km long (685 miles; north coast: 143; Bay of All Saints: 124; and southern: 418). With 68% of its territory located in the [[semi-arid]] zone, the State presents diversified climates and an average rainfall that varies from {{convert|363|to|2000|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, depending on the region.

[[File:Historic Centre of Salvador de Bahia Aerial View 2021-0916.jpg|thumb|right|Historic Centre of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].]]

The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] sighted [[Monte Pascoal]] ("Easter Mountain") near [[Itamaraju]] and landed at what is now [[Porto Seguro]] on the southern coast of Bahia in 1500, claiming the territory for [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]]. In 1549, Portugal established the city of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] on a hill facing the [[#Bay of All Saints|Bay of All Saints]]. The city and [[captaincy of Bahia|surrounding captaincy]] served as an administrative capital of [[Portuguese colonization|Portugal's colonies]] in [[Americas|the Americas]] until 1763. It remained the [[Religion in Brazil|religious]] capital of [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Brazil's Roman Catholic]] hierarchy, with [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Salvador da Bahia|its archbishop]] serving as the [[Primate (bishop)#Roman Catholic Church|national primate]] until 1907.<ref>E. Bradford Burns, A History of Brazil, 3 ed. Columbia University Press, New York, p. 31</ref> [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] holds the country's [[Cathedral of Salvador|oldest cathedral]] and first medical college (1810),<ref>Charles Wagley, An Introduction to Brazil, Columbia University Press, 1971, p. 186</ref> and an engineering school was established in 1899.<ref>E. Bradford Burns, A History of Brazil, 3 ed. Columbia University Press, New York, p. 241</ref>

Bahia's captaincy was the first to fail, with its lands reverting to the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese crown]] in 1549.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} While [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] [[Iberian Union|was united]] with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]  [[Dutch West India Company|West India companies]] [[Dutch–Portuguese War|tried to conquer Bahia]] but was unsuccessful in the area, with [[Dutch Brazil]] restricted to the area from [[Pernambuco]] Northward.<ref>E. Bradford Burns, A History of Brazil, 3 ed. Columbia University Press, New York, p. 50―54</ref>

Bahia was a center of [[sugarcane#History|sugarcane cultivation]] from the 16th to the 18th centuries and contains a number of historic towns, such as [[Cachoeira]], dating from this era. Integral to the sugar economy was the importation of a vast number of [[slavery in Brazil|African slaves]]: more than a third of all [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves taken from Africa]] were sent to Brazil, mostly to be processed in Bahia before being sent to work in plantations elsewhere in the country.<ref>Stuart B Schwartz, Sugar Plantations in the Formation of Brazilian Society: Bahia, 1550-1835</ref>

The state was the last area of the country to join the [[Empire of Brazil]], as members in the local elite remained loyal to the [[Portuguese crown]] after the rest of the country proclaimed [[Independence of Brazil|independence]] under {{nowrap|[[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]}} on 7 September 1822. Control of the province was disputed in several battles, mostly in Pirajá, before the Portuguese were fully expelled on 2 July 1823. It became a Brazilian state in 1889.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

[[Charles Darwin]] visited Bahia in 1832 on [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|his famous voyage]] on the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]''. In 1835, Bahia was the site of an urban [[slave revolt]], the [[Malê revolt|Malê Revolt]] of 1835 by the predominantly Muslim [[West African]] slaves at the time. The term ''malê'' was commonly used to refer to Muslims at the time from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word ''imale''. The revolt is particularly notable as the greatest slave rebellion in the history of the Bahia.<ref>Katia M. Queirós Mattoso, To Be a Slave in Brazil 1550-1888, Trans. Arthur Goldhammer, Rutgers University Press, 1986, p. 143―145</ref>  Under the [[Brazilian Empire|Empire]], Bahia returned 14 deputies to the general assembly and 7 senators; its own provincial assembly consisted of 36 members.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In the 19th century, [[cotton]], [[Brazilian coffee|coffee]], and [[tobacco]] plantations joined those for sugarcane and the discovery of [[diamond]]s in 1844 led to large influx of "washers" (''{{lang|pt|garimpeiros}}'') until the still-larger deposits in [[South Africa]] came to light.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} A smaller boom hit [[Caetité]] in 1872 upon the discovery of [[amethyst]]s there.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The cattle industry of the interior led to the development of [[Feira de Santana]] before collapsing in a series of droughts.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

==Politics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2024}}

Historically, Bahia's politics and that of the country have been closely intertwined, initially due to Salvador's status as the first capital of Brazil. During the [[Empire of Brazil|imperial period]], several prime ministers originated from Bahia; during the early years of the Republic, Bahia produced some noteworthy national figures, such as [[Ruy Barbosa]], Cezar Zama, and Aristides Spínola, amongst others.

During the [[First Brazilian Republic]] (''República Velha'') the biggest name in the state's politics was José Joaquim Seabra, also known as J. J. Seabra; the [[Vargas Era|Vargas era]] and the subsequent re-democratization period saw the rise of [[Juracy Magalhães]] and [[Otávio Mangabeira]], respectively. During the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military dictatorship]], the governorship of [[Antônio Carlos Magalhães]] (also known by his initials, ACM) marked the politics of Bahia for three decades, with one brief defeat in 1980 by [[Waldir Pires]]. Despite this defeat ACM later occupied many other public offices; he died in 2007 while serving as senator. ACM's wide-reaching influence in the state's politics has been dubbed "Carlismo", and is considered an example of a larger phenomenon called [[Coronelism|coronelismo]] ("colonel-ism").  

After the end of military rule in Brazil in 1985, the government of the state of Bahia oscillated between two parties, the ''Partido da Frente Liberal'' (PFL, now the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]]) and the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB). The [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) was elected to the governorship in 2007 and has held it ever since, through five successive elections (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022). 

=== Government structure ===
As a [[Federative units of Brazil|federative unit]] of Brazil, Bahia has its own three branches of government (executive,  legislative, judiciary), which are operated by the [[List of governors of Bahia|Governor]], the [[Legislative Assembly of Bahia|Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Judiciary of Brazil|Court of Justice of the State of Bahia]], respectively. Elected terms last four years, with state and federal elections being held simultaneously. The governor of the state is limited to two consecutive terms. The Legislative Assembly is composed of 63 state deputies. At the federal level, Bahia is represented by [[57th Legislature of the National Congress|three senators]] and [[57th Legislature of the National Congress|39 federal deputies]]. Municipal elections are held two years after the state and federal elections.

The state capital is the city of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], but once a year the capital is moved to [[Cachoeira]] in recognition of the city's importance in the struggle for the [[independence of Brazil]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Constitution of the State of Bahia: October 5, 1989 (as Amended to April 5, 2017) (Brazil [br]) |url=https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/display/10.1093/ocw/law-ocw-cd1085.regGroup.1/law-ocw-cd1085?prd=OXCON |access-date=2024-01-09 |website=Oxford Constitutions |language=en |doi=10.1093/ocw/law-ocw-cd1085.reggroup.1/law-ocw-cd1085?prd=oxcon| doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 }}</ref>

There are 10,110,100 registered voters, according to data from 2012, making Bahia the state with the fourth highest number of voters in the country. Most voters reside in the capital (and most populous city), Salvador.<ref>{{Cite web |title=R7 Eleições 2012 - Bahia é o quarto Estado do País com maior número de eleitores |url=http://noticias.r7.com/eleicoes-2012/noticias/bahia-e-o-quarto-estado-do-pais-com-maior-numero-de-eleitores/ |access-date=2024-01-09 |website=R7 Eleições 2012 |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

As the chief locus of the early Brazilian slave trade, Bahia is considered to possess the greatest and most distinctive African imprint, in terms of culture and customs, in Brazil. These include the [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]]-derived religious system of [[Candomblé]], the [[capoeira]] (martial art emerged in [[Palmares (quilombo)|Quilombo dos Palmares]], located in the state of [[Alagoas]] ), African-derived music such as [[samba]] (especially Brazilian samba precursor, the samba-de-roda), [[afoxé]], and [[axé]], and a cuisine with strong links to western Africa.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

Bahia is the birthplace of many noted Brazilian artists, writers and musicians. Among the noted musical figures born in the state are [[Dorival Caymmi]], [[Joao Gilberto]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Raul Seixas]], [[Pepeu Gomes]], [[Margareth Menezes]], [[Daniela Mercury]], [[Carlinhos Brown]], [[Ivete Sangalo]], and [[Pitty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

[[File:Vaqueiros baianos, vaqueiros nordestinos no sertão.jpg|thumb| Vaqueiros in [[Uauá]] city, Bahia.]]

The city of Salvador is also home to groups known as "blocos-afros", including [[Olodum]], [[Timbalada]], and [[Ilê Aiyê]]. Additionally, groups such as [[Novos Baianos]], [[Chiclete com Banana]], [[Camisa de Vênus]], [[Banda Eva]], [[BaianaSystem]] are based in Bahia. The first well-known rock'n roll singer in Brazil was also from Bahia. Born [[Raul Seixas]], he was known as "Maluco Beleza" or "Peaceful Lunatic" (being "beleza (beauty)" in this manner means to be either "in peace" or "tranquil").{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

During the 19th century, one of Brazil's greatest poets, the Bahian [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] poet and playwright [[Castro Alves]], a native of the ''recôncavo'' city of [[Cachoeira]], penned his poem, ''Navio negreiro'', about slavery; the poem is considered a masterpiece of Brazilian [[Romanticism]] and a central [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] text.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

Other notable Bahian writers include playwright and screenwriter [[Dias Gomes]], [[Gregório de Matos]], who wrote during the 17th century and was one of the first Brazilian writers, and Fr. [[António Vieira]], who during the colonial period was one of many authors who contributed to the expansion of the Portuguese language throughout the Brazilian territory.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

One of Brazil's most prominent writers of the 20th century, [[Jorge Amado]], was born in the southeastern Bahian city of [[Itabuna]], and resided for many years in Salvador. His major novels include ''[[Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon]]''; ''[[Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands]]''; and ''Tieta, the Goat Girl'', all of which became internationally renowned films. Other notable authors from Bahia include the fiction writers [[João Ubaldo Ribeiro]] and historic writer [[Euclides da Cunha]], who wrote "[[Os Sertões]]".
In the visual and plastic arts, one of the best known Bahian figures was the multigenre artist and [[Argentina|Argentinian]] native Hector Julio Páride Bernabó, also known as [[Carybé]] (1911–1997). Fine examples of his work are visible in the [[Afro-Brazilian]] Museum in Salvador.

In the interior of the state, there is the traditional culture of the ''vaqueiros'' among agricultural communities. From the 1550s onward, in Bahia, these farmers were integral to the process of expansion away from the coasts of Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bahia – Ofício de Vaqueiros |website=ipatrimônio.org |url=http://www.ipatrimonio.org/bahia-oficio-de-vaqueiros/ |access-date=2022-10-13 |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

There is a [[World Heritage Site]] in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]. Pelourinho was once Salvador's principal red-light district as well as a working-class neighborhood that was home to thousands of Afro-Brazilians.{{Clarify|date=December 2018}} Since 1992, however, the overwhelming majority of these people have been forcibly removed and replaced by boutiques, NGO headquarters, government offices, folkloric representations, monuments, and amenities for tourists.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Revolt of the Saints: Memory and Redemption in the Twilight of Brazilian Racial Democracy|last=Collins|first=John|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780822353065|location=Durham|pages=1–43, 181–214}}</ref>

== Economy ==
In 2004, Bahia comprised 4.9% of the [[economy of Brazil|economic activity of Brazil]] and it has the biggest GDP of the states of the North and Northeast. The industrial sector is the largest component of [[GDP]] at 48.5%, followed by the service sector at 40.8%. Agriculture represents 10.7% of GDP (2004). Bahia exports: chemicals 22.4%, fuel 17.5%, mineral metallics 13%, paper 9.4%, [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] 5.6%, vehicles 4.8%, [[soybean]] 4.5% (2002). In addition to important agricultural and industrial sectors, the state also has considerable [[mineral]] and [[petroleum]] deposits.

During the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial]] and [[Empire of Brazil|imperial periods]], Bahia was a center of Brazilian [[sugarcane]] production and [[slavery in Brazil|slave trading]]. In the 19th century, the Bay of All Saints was also a [[history of whaling|whaling]] spot, as some species of [[whale]]s used the bay as a mating ground.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} By that time, the province was also growing [[cotton]], [[Brazilian coffee|coffee]], and [[tobacco]] with great success.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} [[cassava|mandioc]], [[rice]], [[beans]], and [[maize|corn]], [[saffron]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[mango]]es, and other fruit were grown for local consumption.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The arid interior was mostly used for [[cattle farmer|cattle-farming]], but this was ruined by a series of droughts caused in part by the custom of starting annual wildfires to improve the grass.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} [[Diamond]]s, [[gold]], and [[amethyst]]s were panned for in the rivers, while [[coal]] was mined on [[Itaparica]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] was being farmed by the time of the [[First World War]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} It grew more than the national average, due to the fact that the state was previously below the average level.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

In [[agriculture]], the state stands out in the production of [[cotton]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[soy]] and [[tropical fruits]] such as [[coconut]], [[papaya]], [[mango]], [[banana]] and [[guarana]], in addition to also producing [[sugar cane]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[beans]] and [[cassava]], among others.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

In 2017, the Northeast Region was the largest producer of [[coconut]] in the country, with 74.0% of national production. Bahia produced 351&nbsp;million fruits, being the leader in the country. However, the sector has been suffering strong competition and losing market to Indonesia, the Philippines and India, the world's largest producers, who even export coconut water to Brazil. In addition to climatic problems, the low productivity of coconut palms in the Northeast Region is the result of factors related to the variety of coconut harvested and the technological level used in coastal regions. In these areas, the semi-extractive cultivation system still prevails, with low fertility and without the adoption of cultural management practices. The three states that have the largest production, Bahia, Sergipe and Ceará, present a yield three times lower than that of Pernambuco, which is in 5th place in the national production. This is because most of the coconut trees in these three states are located in coastal areas and cultivated in semi-extractivist systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/4296541/61_coco.pdf/c172dd8f-3044-f1db-5d0c-a94c5eb735e0|title=Produção de Coco: O Nordeste É Destaque Nacional|access-date=Aug 5, 2020|archive-date=June 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200628161559/https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/4296541/61_coco.pdf/c172dd8f-3044-f1db-5d0c-a94c5eb735e0|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the production of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], for a long time, Bahia led the Brazilian production. Today, it is disputing the leadership of national production with the state of Pará. In 2017 Pará obtained the leadership for the first time. In 2019, people from Pará harvested 135 thousand tons of cocoa, and Bahians harvested 130 thousand tons. Bahia's cocoa area is practically three times larger than that of Pará, but Pará's productivity is practically three times greater. Some factors that explain this are: the crops in Bahia are more extractivist, and those in Pará have a more modern and commercial style, in addition to paraenses using more productive and resistant seeds, and their region providing resistance to [[Witch's broom]].<ref name="ReferenceE">{{Cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/economia/agronegocios/globo-rural/noticia/2019/11/03/lideranca-na-producao-brasileira-de-cacau-volta-para-casa-no-para-com-a-uniao-de-agricultores.ghtml|title=Pará retoma liderança na produção brasileira de cacau, com a união de agricultores|website=G1|date=3 November 2019 |access-date=Aug 5, 2020|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728231530/https://g1.globo.com/economia/agronegocios/globo-rural/noticia/2019/11/03/lideranca-na-producao-brasileira-de-cacau-volta-para-casa-no-para-com-a-uniao-de-agricultores.ghtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bahia is the largest Brazilian producer of [[guaraná]]. In 2017, Brazilian production was close to 3.3&nbsp;million tons.

Despite the fact that the fruit originated in the Amazon, since 1989 Bahia has beaten Amazonas in terms of production volume and guarana productivity, due to the fact that the soil in Bahia is more favorable, in addition to the absence of diseases in the region. The most famous users of the product, however, acquire 90% to 100% of their guarana from the Amazon region, such as [[Ambev]] and [[Coca-Cola]]. Bahian guarana prices are well below those of other states, but Sudam's tax exemptions lead the beverage industry to prefer to purchase seeds in the North, which helps maintain the highest added value of Amazonian guarana. The pharmaceutical industries and importers, on the other hand, buy more guarana from Bahia, due to the price.<ref name="valor.globo.com">{{Cite web|url=https://valor.globo.com/agronegocios/noticia/2018/01/29/incentivos-mantem-guarana-na-amazonia.ghtml|title=Incentivos mantêm guaraná na Amazônia|website=Valor Econômico|date=29 January 2018 |access-date=Aug 5, 2020|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728233341/https://valor.globo.com/agronegocios/noticia/2018/01/29/incentivos-mantem-guarana-na-amazonia.ghtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Highways===
[[File:Bahia BR-116 (6276063177).jpg|thumb|right|BR-101 highway in Bahia]]

The state has its transportation based on highways, with few options in other sectors. The main highways in the state are all from the Federal Government:

* [[BR-101]] – It borders the state coast, connecting it with the country's richest region (Southeast) and with the rest of the Northeast. It passes through the [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] producing area of the state, in the cities of [[Itabuna]] and [[Ilhéus]], reaching the capital Salvador and from there to [[Aracaju]], capital of [[Sergipe]].
* [[BR-116]] – also crosses the state from north to south, parallel to BR 101 but passing further inland. It cuts through some of the important cities of the state, such as [[Vitória da Conquista]], [[Jequié]], [[Feira de Santana]] and [[Euclides da Cunha, Bahia|Euclides da Cunha]], going towards the interior of [[Pernambuco]] and [[Fortaleza]], capital of [[Ceará]].
* BR-242 – the highway cuts the state in half in an east–west direction, connecting Salvador to [[Brasília]], the country's capital. It passes through important cities like [[Lençóis]], [[Barreiras]] and [[Luís Eduardo Magalhães]].
* BR-407 – together with [[BR-324]], the highway connects the region of Bahia, which is the largest producer of fruit and the largest breeder of [[sheep]] and [[goats]], in the cities of [[Juazeiro]] and [[Casa Nova]], to Feira de Santana, Salvador and southeastern Brazil. The BR-235 borders the North of the state, connecting these same regions to the coast of Bahia.
* [[BR-110]] – crossing the interior of the Northeast Region, this highway connects Salvador with the hydroelectric plant of [[Paulo Afonso]] and reaches [[Mossoró]], in [[Rio Grande do Norte]]

Also noteworthy is the [[BR-030]], which crosses the south of Bahia in an east–west direction.
