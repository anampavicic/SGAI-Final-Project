'''Durban''' ({{IPAc-en|'|d|ɜːr|b|ə|n}} {{respell|DUR|bən}}; {{langx|zu|eThekwini}}, from {{lang|zu|itheku}} meaning "bay, lagoon"){{efn | Also called {{langx|zu|eZibubulungwini|label=none}} for the mountain range that terminates in the area. In an 1859 Zulu grammar book, Bishop Colenso asserted that the root word iTeku means "bay of the sea", from the name Mtheku, used by the Thabethe tribes clan, who were the leaders of the Nguni people. Furthermore the original local inhabitants and noted that the locative form, eTekwini, was used as a proper name for Durban. An 1895 English-Zulu dictionary translates the base word iteku as "bay", "creek", "gulf" or "sinus", while a 1905 Zulu-English dictionary notes that eTekwini is used for Durban.}} is the third-most populous city in [[South Africa]], after [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]], and the largest city in the [[Provinces of South Africa|province]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. Situated on the east coast of South Africa, on the Natal Bay of the [[Indian Ocean]], Durban is [[Port of Durban|largest port city in sub-saharan Africa]] and was formerly named Port Natal. North of the harbour and city centre lies the  mouth of the [[Umgeni River]]; the flat city centre rises to the hills of the [[Berea, Durban|Berea]] on the west; and to the south, running along the coast, is the [[Bluff, KwaZulu-Natal|Bluff]]. Durban is the seat of the larger [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]], which spans an area of {{cvt|2556|km2|sqmi}} and had a population of 4.2{{nbsp}}million in [[2022 South African census|2022]],<ref name="census2022" /> making the metropolitan population one of [[Africa]]'s largest on the Indian Ocean. Within the [[city limits]], Durban's population was 595,061 in [[2011 South African census|2011]].<ref name="census2011" /> The city has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with hot, wet summers and mild, dry winters.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Debra | last2=O'Donoghue | first2=Sean | date=2013 | title=Urban environmental challenges and climate change action in Durban, South Africa | journal=Environment and Urbanization | volume=25 | issue=2 | pages=299–319 | doi=10.1177/0956247813500904 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

Archaeological evidence from the [[Drakensberg]] mountains suggests that the area had been inhabited by [[hunter-gatherers]] millennia ago. Later, the [[Nguni people]] occupied the region. During [[Christmas]] 1497, [[Vasco da Gama]] saw the coast and named it {{lang|pt|Natal}}, the Portuguese word for Christmas. In 1824, English traders from [[Cape Colony]], led by [[Francis Farewell]] and [[Henry Fynn]], established a trading post at Port Natal, and later that year, [[Shaka]], the Zulu king, granted them land around the Bay. In 1835, the settlement was named after Sir [[Benjamin D'Urban]], then governor of Cape Colony, and became a borough in 1854. From 1860 onwards, indentured labourers from [[British India]] arrived in Durban, as well as later passenger [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. [[Colony of Natal|Natal colony]], which had grown, became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910, and Durban was granted city status in 1935.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/durban-timeline-1497-1990 | title=Durban Timeline 1497-1990 | website=South African History Online | access-date=12 March 2024 | archive-date=2 March 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240302005422/https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/durban-timeline-1497-1990 | url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==
{{For timeline}}
Archaeological evidence from the [[Drakensberg]] mountains suggests that the Durban area has been inhabited by communities of [[hunter-gatherer]]s since [[Middle Paleolithic|100,000 BP]]. These people lived throughout the area of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] until the [[Bantu expansion|expansion of agro-pastoralists and pastoralists]] from the north saw their gradual incorporation. [[oral tradition|Oral history]] has been passed down from generation to generation by the Zulu nation, who were inhabitants of the land before European colonisers, but there is no [[Recorded history|written history]] of the area until it was sighted by Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]], who sailed parallel to the KwaZulu-Natal coast at [[Christmastide]] in 1497 while searching for a route from Europe to India. He named the area {{Lang|pt|Natal}}, meaning "Christmas" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=walker1>{{cite book|title = A History of Southern Africa|author=Eric A. Walker|publisher=Longmans|orig-year = 1928|year = 1964|location = London|chapter = Chapter I: The discovery}}</ref>

=== Abambo people ===
In 1686, a ship from the [[Dutch East India Company]] named ''Stavenisse'' was wrecked off the eastern coast of South Africa. Some of the survivors made their way to the Bay of Natal (Durban) where they were taken in by the "Abambo" tribe ([[Hlubi people]]), which was led by Chief [[Langalibalele]]. The crew became fluent in the tribe's language and witnessed their customs. The tribe told them that the land where the Abambo people lived was called Embo by the natives and that the people were very hospitable.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

On 28 October 1689, the [[galiot]] ''Noord'' travelled from Table Bay to the Bay of Natal to fetch the surviving crew of the ''Stavenisse'' and to negotiate a deal for purchasing the bay. The ''Noord'' arrived on 9 December 1689, whereafter the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] purchased the Bay of Natal from the Abambo people for £1,650.  A formal contract was drawn up by Laurens van Swaanswyk and signed by the chief of the Abambo people, with the crew of the ''Stavenisse'' acting as translators.<ref>History of South Africa 1486 - 1691, George McCall Theal, London 1888.</ref>

=== First European colonisers ===
By 1822, James Saunders King, captain of the British ship {{ship||Salisbury|1818 ship|2}}, together with [[Francis Farewell|Lt. Francis George Farewell]], both men being former [[Royal Navy]] officers from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], were engaged in trade between the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a severe storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went well and they found safe anchor from the storm. Lt. King decided to map the Bay and named the "Salisbury and Farewell Islands". In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson & Co., decided to open trade relations with [[Shaka]] the Zulu King, and establish a trading station at the Bay. [[Henry Francis Fynn]], another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

Fynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig ''Julia'', while Farewell followed six weeks later on the ''Antelope''. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, although only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn succeeded in befriending the king by helping him recover from a stab wound that he had suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of his gratitude King Shaka granted Fynn a "25-[[mile]] strip of coast a hundred miles in depth".{{cn|date=December 2023}}

On 7 August 1824, they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending {{cvt|10|mi|disp=flip}} south of the Bay, {{cvt|25|mi|disp=flip}} north of the Bay and {{cvt|100|mi|disp=flip}} inland. 
Farewell took possession of this grant and raised the [[Union Jack]] with a Royal Salute, which consisted of four cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Only six of the original eighteen would-be settlers remained, and these six can be regarded as the founders of Port Natal as a British colony. These six were joined by Lt. James Saunders King and [[Nathaniel Isaacs]] in 1825.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

The modern city of Durban thus dates from 1824, when the settlement was established on the northern shores of the bay near today's Farewell Square.<ref name=walker7>{{cite book

Walker|publisher=Longmans|orig-year = 1928|year = 1965|location = London|chapter = Chapter VII: The period of change 1823–36}}</ref> During a meeting of 35 European residents in Fynn's territory on 23 June 1835, it was decided to build a capital town and name it "D'Urban" after [[Benjamin D'Urban|Sir Benjamin D'Urban]], who was the governor of the Cape Colony at the time.<ref>{{cite web

=== Republic of Natalia ===
{{Main| Battle of Congella}}
The [[Voortrekkers]] established the [[Natalia Republic|Republic of Natalia]] in 1839, with its capital at [[Pietermaritzburg]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Project update - Republic of Natalia records {{!}} The Heritage Portal |url=https://www.theheritageportal.co.za/notice/project-update-republic-natalia-records |access-date=2024-04-24 |website=www.theheritageportal.co.za |archive-date=30 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240430205045/https://www.theheritageportal.co.za/notice/project-update-republic-natalia-records |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tension between the Voortrekkers and the Zulus prompted the governor of the Cape Colony to dispatch a force under Captain Charlton Smith to establish British rule in Natal, for fear of losing British control in Port Natal. The force arrived on 4 May 1842 and built a fortification that was later to be ''The Old Fort''. On the night of 23/24 May 1842, the British attacked the Voortrekker camp at Congella. The attack failed, and the British had to withdraw to their camp, which was put under siege. A local trader [[Dick King]] and his servant Ndongeni were able to escape the blockade and rode to [[Grahamstown]], a distance of {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} in fourteen days to raise reinforcements. The reinforcements arrived in Durban 20 days later; the Voortrekkers retreated, and the siege was lifted.<ref name=bulpin12>{{cite book|title = Natal and the Zulu Country|author=T.V.

Fierce conflict with the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] population led to the evacuation of Durban, and eventually the [[Afrikaner]]s accepted British annexation in 1844 under military pressure.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Natal becomes part of the Union of South Africa {{!}} South African History Online |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/natal-becomes-part-union-south-africa |access-date=2024-04-24 |website=www.sahistory.org.za |archive-date=24 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240424091651/https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/natal-becomes-part-union-south-africa |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Durban's historic regalia====
When the Borough of Durban was proclaimed in 1854, the council had to procure a seal for official documents. The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D’Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the [[College of Arms]] in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D’Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council's stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council's stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads "Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur"—"Better fortune follows a humble beginning".{{cn|date=December 2023}}

The blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979. The coat of arms fell into disuse with the re-organisation of the South African local government structure in 2000. The seal ceased to be used in 1995.<ref>{{cite web

In July 1996, [[Obed Mlaba]] was appointed mayor of Durban UniCity; in 1999 he was elected mayor of the eThekwini municipality and re-elected in 2006.

The name of the Durban municipal government, prior to the post-apartheid reorganisations of municipalities, was the ''Durban Corporation'' or ''City of Durban''.<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/bylaws/durban-corporation-transport-bylaws Durban Corporation Bylaws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906142926/http://www1.durban.gov.za/durban/government/bylaws/durban-corporation-transport-bylaws |date=6 September 2015 }}''eThekwini Online''.</ref>

== Geography ==
Durban is located on the east coast of South Africa, looking out upon the [[Indian Ocean]]. The city lies at the mouth of the [[Umgeni River]], which demarcates parts of Durban's north city limit, while other sections of the river flow through the city itself. Durban has a natural harbour, [[Port of Durban]], which is the busiest port in South Africa and the fourth-busiest in the Southern Hemisphere.

The extent of [[urban sprawl]] the Greater Durban [[Agglomerations|agglomeration]] has experienced, virtually adjoining surrounding smaller towns, has made boundaries in the [[metropolitan area]] quite complicated. Durban proper, which is the main city, is demarcated by its administrative city limits, which are only as large to include the [[city centre]], the [[Bluff, KwaZulu-Natal|Bluff]], [[Berea, Durban|Berea]], [[Durban North]], [[Mobeni]] as well as [[Umbogintwini]], [[Athlone Park]], [[Isipingo]] and [[Prospecton]] to the south among other suburbs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Census 2011: Main Place: Durban |url=https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/599054 |access-date=2023-03-07 |website=census2011.adrianfrith.com |archive-date=7 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307151214/https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/599054 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Census 2001: Main Place: Durban |url=https://census2001.adrianfrith.com/place/57218 |access-date=2023-03-07 |website=census2001.adrianfrith.com |archive-date=7 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307151214/https://census2001.adrianfrith.com/place/57218 |url-status=live }}</ref>

However, the [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] is an amalgamation of Durban proper and more than 120 other nearby formerly independent towns and suburbs such as [[Amanzimtoti]], [[Cato Ridge]], [[Chatsworth, KwaZulu-Natal|Chatsworth]], [[Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal|Hillcrest]], [[KwaMashu]], [[Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal|Inanda]], [[oThongathi]], [[Pinetown]], [[Queensburgh]], [[UMhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|uMhlanga]], [[Umlazi]], [[Verulam, KwaZulu-Natal|Verulam]] and [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]] among others that have organically merged yet still retain their legal boundaries.

The name "Durban" is commonly referred to by residents as not just the city proper but the Greater Durban metropolitan area that sometimes extends beyond eThekwini to include [[Scottburgh]], [[Ballito]] and [[KwaDukuza]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} Similarly, the [[demonym]] of a "Durbanite" not only refers to people who live within Durban proper but to residents of the Greater Durban metropolitan area.

=== Climate ===
Durban has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), with hot, humid summers and mild to warm, moderately dry winters, which are frost-free. Durban has an annual rainfall of {{convert|1009|mm|in|1}}. The average temperature in summer ranges around {{convert|24|C|F}}, while in winter the average temperature is {{convert|17|C|F}}.

A 2019 paper published in [[PLOS One]] estimated that under [[Representative Concentration Pathway#RCP 4.5|Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5]], a "moderate" scenario of [[climate change]] where global warming reaches ~{{convert|2.5-3|C-change|F-change}} by 2100, the climate of Durban in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of [[Kigali]]. The annual temperature would increase by {{convert|1.7|C-change|F-change}}, and the temperature of the coldest month by {{convert|1.8|C-change|F-change}}, while the temperature of the warmest month would be {{convert|0.5|C-change|F-change}} lower.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bastin |first1=Jean-Francois |last2=Clark |first2=Emily |last3=Elliott |first3=Thomas |last4=Hart |first4=Simon |last5=van den Hoogen |first5=Johan |last6=Hordijk |first6=Iris |last7=Ma |first7=Haozhi |last8=Majumder |first8=Sabiha |last9=Manoli |first9=Gabriele |last10=Maschler |first10=Julia |last11=Mo |first11=Lidong |last12=Routh |first12=Devin |last13=Yu |first13=Kailiang |last14=Zohner |first14=Constantin M. |last15=Thomas W. |first15=Crowther |title=Understanding climate change from a global analysis of city analogues |journal=PLOS ONE |date=10 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |at=S2 Table.

Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Durban is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], Durban, [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]) which would be the most severely affected by future [[sea level rise]]. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of USD 65 billion under RCP 4.5 and USD 86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to 137.5 billion USD in damages, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to USD 187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, USD 206 billion for RCP8.5 and USD 397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.<ref>Trisos, C.H., I.O.

Durban is ethnically diverse, with a cultural richness of mixed beliefs and traditions. [[Zulu people|Zulus]] form the largest single ethnic group. It has a large number of people of [[British diaspora in Africa|British]] and [[Indian South African|Indian]] descent. The influence of Indians in Durban has been significant, bringing with them a variety of cuisine, culture and religion.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Durban-largest-Indian-city-outside-India/articleshow/9328227.cms | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701174938/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-23/mumbai/29807173_1_durban-south-africa-uk | url-status=live | archive-date=1 July 2012 | title=Durban largest 'Indian' city outside India | first=Anahita | last=Mukherji | date=23 June 2011 | work=[[The Times of India]] | access-date=2011-11-30}}</ref>

In the years following the end of apartheid, there was a population boom as black Africans were allowed to move into the city. The population grew by an annual average of 2.34% between 1996 and 2001. This led to shanty towns forming around the city, which were often demolished. Between 2001 and 2011, the population growth slowed down to 1.08% per year and shanty towns have become less common as the government builds low-income housing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1021&id=ethekwini-municipality |title=Metropolitan Municipality &#124; Statistics South Africa |access-date=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104094830/http://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1021&id=ethekwini-municipality |archive-date=4 November 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[King Shaka International Airport]] services both domestic and international flights, with regularly scheduled services to [[Dubai]], [[Doha]], [[Istanbul]], [[Harare]], [[Lusaka]] & [[Manzini, Eswatini|Manzini]] as well as eight domestic destinations. Flights to [[Gaborone]] start on 2 October 2024. The airport's position forms part of the Golden Triangle between Johannesburg and Cape Town, which is important for convenient travel and trade between these three major South African cities. The airport opened in May 2010. King Shaka International Airport handled 6.1 million passengers in 2019/2020, up 1.8 percent from 2018/2019. King Shaka International was constructed at [[La Mercy, KwaZulu-Natal|La Mercy]], about {{convert|36|km|mi}} north of central Durban. All operations at [[Durban International Airport]] have been transferred to [[King Shaka International]] as of 1 May 2010, with plans for flights to [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kigali]], [[Luanda]], [[Lilongwe]] and [[Nairobi]].

=== Sea ===
[[File:Durban harbor.jpg|thumb|Durban Harbour]]

Durban has a long tradition as a port city. The [[Port of Durban]], formerly known as Port Natal, is one of the few natural [[Harbor|harbour]]s between [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[Maputo]], and is also located at the beginning of a particular{{clarify|date=June 2021}} weather phenomenon that can cause extremely violent seas. These two features made Durban an extremely busy [[Port|port of call]] for ship repairs when the port was opened in the 1840s.

[[MSC Cruises]] bases one of their cruise ships in Durban from November to April every year. From the 2023/2024 Southern Africa cruise season [[MSC Cruises]] will be basing the [[MSC Splendida]] in Durban. Durban is the most popular cruise hub in Southern Africa. Cruise destinations from Durban on the [[MSC Splendida|MSC ''Splendida'']] include [[Mozambique]], [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]], [[Madagascar]] and other domestic destinations such as Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. Many other ships cruise through Durban every year, including some of the world's biggest, such as the [[RMS Queen Mary 2|RMS ''Queen Mary 2'']], the biggest ocean liner in the world. Durban has built a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that has been in operation since October 2019, the [[Durban Cruise Terminal]]. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd, which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium. The new cruise terminal will be able to accommodate two cruise ships at any given time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article2650355.ece|title=Times LIVE|website=www.timeslive.co.za|access-date=1 June 2017|archive-date=6 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206173410/https://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article2650355.ece/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Naval Base Durban]] on [[Salisbury Island, Durban|Salisbury Island]] (now joined to the mainland and part of the Port of Durban), was established as a [[naval base]] during the [[Second World War]]. It was downgraded in 2002 to a naval station. In 2012 a decision was made to renovate and expand the facilities back up to a full naval base to accommodate the [[South African Navy]]'s [[offshore patrol vessel|offshore patrol]] flotilla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23908:navy-may-upgrade-naval-station-durban-&catid=108:maritime-security&Itemid=233|title=Navy may upgrade Naval Station Durban|author=Leon Engelbrecht|work=defenceweb.co.za|access-date=2 October 2014|archive-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006110532/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23908:navy-may-upgrade-naval-station-durban-&catid=108:maritime-security&Itemid=233|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2015 it was redesignated Naval Base Durban.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kim |last=Helfrich |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=41760:minister-says-its-naval-base-durban-not-station&catid=111:sa-defence&Itemid=242 |title=Minister says it's Naval Base Durban, not Station |publisher=defenceWeb |date=2015-12-09 |access-date=2015-12-09 |archive-date=11 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211062421/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=41760:minister-says-its-naval-base-durban-not-station&catid=111:sa-defence&Itemid=242 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Rail ===
Durban featured the first operating steam railway in South Africa when the [[Natal Railway Company]] started operating a line between the Point and the city of Durban in 1860.<ref name="Holland 1">Steam Locomotives of the South African Railways, vol 1: 1859–1910, (D.F. Holland, 1971), p11, 20–21, {{ISBN|0-7153-5382-9}}</ref>

[[Shosholoza Meyl]], the passenger rail service of [[Transnet Freight Rail|Spoornet]], operates two long-distance passenger rail services from Durban: a daily service to and from Johannesburg via [[Pietermaritzburg]] and [[Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal|Newcastle]], and a weekly service to and from Cape Town via [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and [[Bloemfontein]]. These trains terminate at [[Durban railway station]].

[[Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Durban and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network runs from Durban Station outwards as far as [[KwaDukuza]] on the [[North Coast (KwaZulu-Natal)|North Coast]], [[Kelso, KwaZulu-Natal|Kelso]] on the [[South Coast (KwaZulu-Natal)|South Coast]], and [[Cato Ridge]] inland.

A [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] has been proposed; this link would Johannesburg and Durban.<ref>{{cite web

=== Roads ===
[[File:DurbanN3-aerial.jpg|thumb|N3 freeway on its approach to Durban's CBD, with N2–N3 [[stack interchange]] in the foreground]]

The city's main position as a [[port of entry]] onto the southern African continent has led to the development of [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] around it. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3 Western Freeway]], which links Durban with the economic hinterland of [[Gauteng]], heads west out of the city. The [[Durban Outer Ring Road|N2 Outer Ring Road]] links Durban with the [[Eastern Cape]] to the south, and [[Mpumalanga]] in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the [[Witwatersrand]] for transfer to the port.

The N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The [[EB Cloete Interchange]] (which is informally nicknamed the [[Spaghetti Junction]]) lies to the west of Durban and east of [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]], allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 [[Durban Outer Ring Road|Outer Ring Road]] and the Western Freeway.

The N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the [[KwaZulu-Natal North Coast|north coast]] to the [[South Coast (KwaZulu-Natal)|south coast]]. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as [[eManzimtoti]], [[Kingsburgh, KwaZulu-Natal|Kingsburgh]], [[Scottburgh]], [[Umkomaas|eMkhomazi]], [[Ballito]] and [[KwaDukuza]]) that rely on Durban.

Durban also has a system of freeway and [[Dual carriageway|dual arterial]] [[Metropolitan Routes in Durban|metropolitan routes]], which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The [[M4 (Durban)|M4]] exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway and Leo Boyd Highway, starts as an alternative highway from the [[R102 (South Africa)|R102]] in [[Ballito]] and shortly after intersects the N2. It passes through the seaside towns and villages of La Mercy and [[eMdloti]] before becoming a dual carriageway in [[UMhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|uMhlanga]], north of Durban and ending at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the [[Albert Lutuli|Inkosi Albert Lutuli]] Highway<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/services/services_news/red-tar-for-southern-freeway]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects at the southern end of the N2 Outer Ring Road.

The [[M7 (Durban)|M7]] connects the southern industrial basin of Durban with the N3 and [[Pinetown]] via [[Queensburgh]] via the N2. The [[M19 (Durban)|M19]] connects the inner northern suburbs of Durban with Pinetown via [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]] and the [[M41 (Durban)|M41]] connects [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|uMhlanga]] and [[Phoenix, KwaZulu-Natal|Phoenix]] via [[Mount Edgecombe]] and the N2.

The [[M13 (Durban)|M13]] (King Cetshwayo Highway) is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill) and is an important commuter route linking the nearby towns and suburbs to the west of Durban such as [[Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal|Hillcrest]], [[Gillitts]], [[Kloof]], Pinetown and Westville to the city.

In the late 2000s, 107 streets in Durban were renamed. They were typically renamed to honour individuals involved in the antiapartheid or international revolutionary movements, with two-thirds of the streets named after individuals associated with the governing [[African National Congress]]. This was done in two stages; a first, smaller one, which renamed eighteen streets and was met with some trepidation by opposition parties, particularly the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], and the [[Minority Front]], and a second, larger stage, which renamed 99 streets and was met with considerably wider opposition after the controversy of the first and the minimal time between them.<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/renaming/Final%20Listt-%20Street%20Naming2.xls]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |title=New road names go up – Politics &#124; IOL News |work=Independent Online |location=South Africa |date=2 July 2008 |access-date=2011-09-16 |archive-date=11 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811112609/http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first group was met with some opposition from This process was met with outrage from both opposition parties and the parts of the general public, as well as incidents of vandalism against the new road signs. The [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], and [[Minority Front]] were concerned with their lack of participation in the process, and that the emphasis on individuals affiliated with the ANC presented a partisan image of the antiapartheid struggle. Among the general public there was significant opposition from middle-class [[white South Africans]], [[Indian South Africans]], and [[Zulu nationalists]], who believed that the new names should have a connection to the people and the history of the locality. In response, the ANC characterized the project as a transformation and part of progressive social change, characterizing their opponents as being "antitransformation" and "pro-apartheid".<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Bainbridge |year=2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain/page/302 302] |title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland |publisher=Lonely Planet |access-date=2011-09-16|isbn=9781742203751 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Wines |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2007 |access-date=2011-09-16 |archive-date=16 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416052505/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duminy |first1=James |title=Street Renaming, Symbolic Capital, and Resistance in Durban, South Africa |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |date=April 2014 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=310–328 |doi=10.1068/d2112 |s2cid=143940799 }}</ref>

=== Buses ===
Several companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa. Buses have a long history in Durban. Most of them have been run by Indian owners since the early 1930s. Privately owned buses that are not subsidised by the government also service the communities. Buses operate in all areas of the eThekwini Municipality. Since 2003 buses have been violently taken out of the routes and bus ranks by taxi operators.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Durban city buses torched|url = http://mg.co.za/article/2008-10-03-durban-city-buses-torched|website = The M&G Online|access-date = 2016-02-17|author = Staff Reporter|date = 3 October 2008|archive-date = 25 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225104330/http://mg.co.za/article/2008-10-03-durban-city-buses-torched|url-status = live}}</ref>

Durban was previously served by the [[Trolleybuses in Durban|Durban trolleybus system]], which ran from 1935 until 1968.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.fad.co.za/Resources/transport/transport.htm | title = Public Transport in Durban - a brief history | publisher = Facts about Durban | last = Allan Jackson | date = 2003 | access-date = 8 July 2017 | archive-date = 30 July 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200730063203/http://www.fad.co.za/Resources/transport/transport.htm | url-status = live }}</ref>

Since 2017, the newer [[Durban People Mover]] Bus System that runs along certain routes has been testing out free [[Wi-Fi]] for passengers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/people-mover-passengers-get-free-wi-fi-11135485|title=People Mover passengers get free wi-fi {{!}} Daily News|website=www.iol.co.za|language=en|access-date=2019-05-21|archive-date=30 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730083650/https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/people-mover-passengers-get-free-wi-fi-11135485|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Taxis ===
Durban has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Share taxi|minibus taxi]]s. Unlike in many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called and ordered to a specific location. A number of companies service the Durban and surrounding regions. These taxis can also be called upon for airport transfers, point to point pickups and shuttles.

Mini bus taxis are the standard [[Mode of transport|form of transport]] for the majority of the population who cannot afford private cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |publisher=CapeTown.org |title=Transport |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184051/http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |archive-date=28 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1566/is_200209/ai_n7215423|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203204842/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1566/is_200209/ai_n7215423|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-02-03|title=South Africa's minibus wars: uncontrollable law-defying minibuses oust buses and trains from transit|publisher=LookSmart}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c2es.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/transportation_in_south_africa/trans_sa_execsumm.cfm|title=Transportation in Developing Countries: Greenhouse Gas Scenarios of south alabama|publisher=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change|access-date=8 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223234303/http://www.c2es.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/transportation_in_south_africa/trans_sa_execsumm.cfm|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often filled over their legal passenger allowance, making for high casualty rates when they are involved in accidents. Minibuses are generally owned and operated in fleets, and inter-operator violence flares up from time to time, especially as [[Taxi wars in South Africa|turf wars]] over lucrative taxi routes occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldconnected.org/article.php/1341.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825221354/http://www.aworldconnected.org/article.php/1341.html|archive-date=25 August 2006|title=Taxing Alternatives: Poverty Alleviation and the South African Taxi/Minibus Industry|publisher=Enterprise Africa!

=== Rickshaws ===
Although [[rickshaw]]s have been a mode of transportation since the early 1900s, they have been displaced by other forms of motorised transport. The roughly 25 remaining rickshaws mostly cater to tourists.<ref>{{cite web|editor=Fiona Wayman, Neville Grimmet and Angela Spencer |url=http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/discover/history/our-town/rickshaws |title=Zulu Rickshaws |publisher=Durban.gov.za |access-date=2 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519145024/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/discover/history/our-town/rickshaws <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=19 May 2010}}</ref>

== Crime and safety ==
Compared to other South African cities, Durban has a high murder rate. Between April 2018 and March 2019, the Ethekwini Metropolitan Municipality recorded 1,871 murders, gradually increasing from 1,349 seven years earlier and down from 2,042 in 2009.<ref>[https://issafrica.org/crimehub/maps/municipal-districts Crimes by municipality or district] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128091727/https://issafrica.org/crimehub/maps/municipal-districts |date=28 November 2019 }}.
