'''Manama''' ({{langx|ar|الْمَنَامَة}} ''{{transl|ar|el-Menâme}}'', <small>[[Bahrani Arabic|Bahrani]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPA|ar|elmɐˈnɑːmɐ|}}) is the capital and [[List of cities in Bahrain|largest city]] of [[Bahrain]], with an approximate population of 297,502 as of 2012. Long an important trading center in the [[Persian Gulf]], Manama is home to a very diverse population. After periods of [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Persia]]n control and a short invasion from the ruling dynasty of [[House of Saud|Saudi Arabia]], followed by a longer invasion by [[House of Al Said|Oman]], Bahrain established itself as an [[sovereign state|independent nation]] in 1971 following a period of British hegemony.

Although the current twin cities of Manama and [[Muharraq]] appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1800s,{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=185}} Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1923. Manama became the mercantile capital and was the gateway to the main [[Bahrain Island]].{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=186}} In the 20th century, Bahrain's oil wealth helped spur fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted [[diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]] effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an important financial hub in the [[Middle East]]. Manama was designated as the 2012 [[Arab Capital of Culture|capital of Arab culture]] by the [[Arab League]], and a [[Global city|beta global city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] in 2018.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120207135843/http://www.manamaculture2012.bh/en/ Manama Capital of Arab Culture 2012]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moc.gov.bh/en/MinistryNews/News/January2012/Name,6222,en.html |title=Ministry of Culture: Manama as the Bahraini Capital of Arab Culture |access-date=9 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911220834/http://www.moc.gov.bh/en/MinistryNews/News/January2012/Name%2C6222%2Cen.html |archive-date=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Manāmah" (without the Al-) was first recorded around the year 730 AH (approximately 1330 AD) during the visit of Turān Shah of [[Strait of Hormuz|Hurmuz]] to the island. At that time, it had already been annexed by his predecessor, Tahamtam II of Hurmuz.<ref name="Tajer2">{{cite book |last=Al-Tajer |first=Mahdi Abdulla |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNs9AAAAIAAJ&q=bahrain+village+persian+name&pg=PA134 |title=Language & Linguistic Origins In Bahrain |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1982 |isbn=9780710300249 |pages=134, 135}}</ref>{{rp||page=23}}

The name is claimed by some to be derived from the [[Arabic]] word الْمَنَامَة (''el-Menâme'') meaning "the place of rest" or "the place of dreams".{{sfn|Room|1997|p=223}}

Originally it was called simply "Manamah" before being renamed to Al-Manamah. In [[Persian language|Persian]], "man" (من) means "me," and "nameh" ([[:fa:نامه|نامه]]) means "letter," similar to the structure of words like "[[Shahnameh|Shah Nameh]]" (Book of Kings).

Additionally, cities like [[Shakhura|Shah Khorah]] (شاه خورا) in Bahrain reflect this Persian influence.

==History==

===Pre-modern history===
There is evidence of human settlement on the northern coastline of Bahrain dating back to the [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Dilmun]] civilisation inhabited the area in 3000&nbsp;BC, serving as a key regional trading hub between [[Mesopotamia]], [[Majan (civilization)|Magan]] and the [[Indus Valley civilisation]].{{sfn|Al-Nabi|2012|p=17}}{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=243}} Approximately 100,000 [[Dilmun burial mounds]] were found across the north and central regions of the country, some originating 5,000 years ago. Despite the discovery of the mounds, there is no significant evidence to suggest heavy urbanisation took place during the [[Dilmun]] era.{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=184}} It is believed that the majority of the population lived in rural areas, numbering several thousand. Evidence of an ancient large rural population was confirmed by one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s ship captains, during voyages in the [[Persian Gulf]]. A vast system of [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s in northern Bahrain helped facilitate ancient horticulture and agriculture.{{sfn|Al-Nabi|2012|p=19}}

The commercial network of Dilmun lasted for almost 2,000 years, after which the [[Assyria]]ns took control of the island in 700&nbsp;BC for more than a century. This was followed by [[Babylonia]]n and [[Achaemenid]] rule, which later gave way to Greek influence during the time of [[Wars of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's conquests]].{{sfn|Rice|2005|p=128}} In the first century AD, the Roman writer [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote of [[Tylos]], the Hellenic name of Bahrain in the [[classical era]], and its [[pearl]]s and cotton fields.{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=243}} The island came under the control of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] empires respectively, by which time [[Nestorian Christianity]] started to spread in Bahrain. By 410–420&nbsp;AD, a Nestorian [[Episcopal see|bishopric]] and [[monastery]] was established in [[Al Dair]], on the neighbouring island of [[Muharraq]].{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=243}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Al A'ali|first=Mohammed|title=Protecting Bahrain's Christian heritage...|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=359780|access-date=31 August 2013|newspaper=[[Gulf Daily News]]|date=24 August 2013|archive-date=25 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825003322/http://gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=359780|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following the conversion of Bahrain to [[Islam]] in 628&nbsp;AD, work on one of the earliest mosques in the region, the [[Khamis Mosque]], began as early as the seventh century AD. During this time, Bahrain was engaged in long distance marine trading, evident from the discovery of [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Chinese coins]] dating between 600 and 1200&nbsp;AD, in Manama.{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=243}}

[[File:Bahrain Fort overview.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Qal'at al-Bahrain|Portuguese Fort]], built by the [[Portuguese Empire]] while it ruled Bahrain from 1521 to 1602]]
In 1330, under the [[Jarwanid dynasty]], the island became a tributary of the [[Kingdom of Hormuz]]. The town of Manama was mentioned by name for the first time in a manuscript dating to 1345&nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=243}} Bahrain, particularly Manama and the nearby settlement of [[Bilad Al Qadeem]], became a centre of [[Shia]] scholarship and training for the [[ulema]], it would remain so for centuries. The ulema would help fund [[pearl hunting|pearling]] expeditions and finance grain production in the rural areas surrounding the city. In 1521, Bahrain fell to the expanding [[Portuguese Empire]] in the Persian Gulf, having already defeated Hormuz.{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=244}} The Portuguese consolidated their hold on the island by constructing the [[Bahrain Fort]], on the outskirts of Manama.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=68}} After numerous revolts and an expanding [[Safavid empire]] in Persia, the Portuguese were expelled from Bahrain and the Safavids took control in 1602.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=68}}

===Early modern history===

The Safavids, sidelining Manama, designated the nearby town of [[Bilad Al Qadeem]] as the provincial capital.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=18}}  The town was also the seat of the Persian governor and the [[Shaikh al-Islam]] of the islands. The position of Shaikh al-Islam lay under the jurisdiction of the central Safavid government and as such, candidates were carefully vetted by the [[Isfahan]] courts. During the Safavid era, the islands continued to be a centre for [[Twelver Shi'ism]] scholarship, producing clerics for use in mainland Persia.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=18}}  Additionally, the rich agricultural northern region of Bahrain continued to flourish due to an abundance of [[date palm]] farms and orchards. The Portuguese traveler [[Pedro Teixeira]] commented on the extensive cultivation of crops like [[barley]] and wheat. The opening of Persian markets to Bahraini exports, especially [[pearl]]s, boosted the islands' export economy. The yearly income of exported Bahraini pearls was 600,000 [[ducat]]s, collected by around 2,000 pearling [[dhow]]s.{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=244}} Another factor that contributed to Bahrain's agricultural wealth was the migration of [[Shia]] cultivators from [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]]-occupied [[Qatif]] and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]], fearing religious persecution, in 1537.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=18}} Sometime after 1736, [[Nader Shah]] constructed a fort on the southern outskirts of Manama (likely the Diwan Fort).{{sfn|Fuccaro|2005|p=42}}

Persian control over the Persian Gulf waned during the later half of the 18th century. At this time, Bahrain archipelago was a dependency of the emirate of [[Bushehr]], itself a part of [[Persia]]. In 1783, the [[Bani Utbah]] tribal confederation [[1783 Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain|invaded]] Bahrain and expelled the resident governor [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]]. As a result, the [[Al Khalifa]] family became the rulers of the country, and all political relations with [[Bushehr]] and [[Persia]]/[[Iran]] were terminated.  [[Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Khalifa]] (later called Ahmed al-Fateh, lit. "Ahmed the conqueror") become the dynasty's first [[Hakim of Bahrain]]. Political instability in the 19th century had disastrous effects on Manama's economy; Invasions by the Omanis in 1800 and by the [[Emirate of Diriyah|Wahhabi]]s in 1810–11, in addition to a civil war in 1842 between Bahrain's co-rulers saw the town being a major battleground. The instability paralysed commercial trade in Manama; the town's port was closed, most merchants fled abroad to [[Kuwait]] and the Persian coast until hostilities ceased.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2005|p=43}} The English scholar [[William Gifford Palgrave]], on a visit to Manama in 1862, described the town as having a few ruined stone buildings, with a landscape dominated with the huts of poor fishermen and pearl-divers.{{sfn|Palgrave|1866}}{{sfn|Fuccaro|2005|p=43}}

[[File:British political agency in Manama.png|right|thumb|The British political agency, {{c.|1900|lk=no}}]]

The [[Pax Britannica]] of the 19th century resulted in British consolidation of trade routes, particularly those close to the [[British Raj]]. In response to piracy in the Persian Gulf region, the British deployed warships and forced much of the Persian Gulf States at the time (including Bahrain) to sign the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820]], which prohibited piracy and slavery.{{sfn|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=244}} In 1861, the [[Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship]] was signed between Britain and Bahrain, which placed the British in charge of defending Bahrain in exchange for British control over Bahraini foreign affairs. With the ascension of [[Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa]] as the Hakim of Bahrain in 1869, Manama became the centre of British activity in the Persian Gulf, though its interests were initially strictly commercial.{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=192}} Trading recovered fully by 1873 and the country's earnings from pearl exports increased by sevenfold between 1873 and 1900.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2005|p=44}} Representing the British were native agents, usually from minorities such as [[Persians in Bahrain|Persians]] or [[Huwala]] who regularly reported back to British India and the [[Persian Gulf Residency|British political residency]] in [[Bushehr]].{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=64}} The position of native agent was later replaced by a British political agent, following the construction of the British political residency (locally referred to in {{langx|ar|بيت الدولة}}) in 1900, which further solidified Britain's position in Manama.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=64}}
{{wide image|Bahrainharbor.jpg|700px|align-cap=center|Manama harbour, {{c.|1870|lk=no}} }}

===Modern history===
[[File:Aerial view of Manama, 1936.png|thumb|Aerial view of Manama in 1936]]
Following the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the [[British Raj]] used Manama as a military base of operations during the [[Mesopotamian campaign]].{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=113}} Prompted by the presence of oil in the region, the British political agency in [[Bushire]] concluded an oil agreement with the Hakim to prohibit the exploration and exploitation of oil for a five-year period. In 1919, Bahrain was officially integrated into the [[British empire]] as an overseas imperial territory following the Bahrain [[order-in-council]] decree, issued in 1913.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=113}} The decree gave the resident political agent greater powers and placed Bahrain under the [[residency of Bushire]] and therefore under the governance of the British Raj. The British pressured a series of [[Bahrain administrative reforms of the 1920s|administrative reforms in Bahrain during the 1920s]] (a move met with opposition from tribal leaders), during which the aging Hakim [[Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa]] was forced to abdicate in favour of his reform-minded son [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa (1872–1942)|Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa]]. A municipal government was established in Manama in 1919, the Customs office was reorganised in 1923 and placed under the supervision of an English businessman, the pearling industry was later reformed in 1924. Earnings from the customs office would be kept in the newly created [[Treasury|state treasury]]. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil courts]] were established for the first time in 1923, followed by the establishment of the Department of Land Registration in 1924.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=114}} [[Charles Belgrave]], from the [[Colonial office]], was appointed in 1926 by the British to carry on further reforms and manage administration as a financial advisor to the King. He later organised the State Police and was in charge of the Finance and Land departments of the government.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=115}}

In 1927, the country's pearling economy collapsed due to the introduction of Japanese cultured pearls in the world market. It is estimated that between 1929 and 1931, pearling entrepreneurs lost more than two-thirds of their income. Further aggravated by the [[Great Depression]], many leading Bahraini businessmen, shopkeepers, and pearl-divers fell into debt.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=127-128}} With the [[First Oil Well, Bahrain|discovery of oil]] in 1932 and the subsequent production of oil exports in 1934, the country gained a greater significance in geopolitics. The security of oil supplies in the Middle East was a priority of the British, especially in the run-up to the Second World War.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=119}} The discovery of oil led to gradual employment of bankrupt divers from the pearling industry in the 1930s, eventually causing the pearling industry to disappear.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=163}} During the war, the country served as a strategic airbase between Britain and India as well as hosting [[RAF Muharraq]] and a [[HMS Jufair|naval base]] in [[Juffair]].{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=201}} Bahrain was [[Bombing of Bahrain in World War II|bombed]] by the [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian Air Force]] in 1940. In 1947, following the end of the war and subsequent Indian independence, the British residency of the Persian Gulf moved to Manama from [[Bushire]].{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=119}}

[[File:View of Manama from the South, 1953.png|thumb|Overview of Manama, 1953]]
Following the rise of [[Arab nationalism]] across the Middle East and sparked by the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, anti-British unrest broke out in Manama, organised by the [[National Union Committee]]. Though the NUC advocated peaceful demonstrations, buildings and enterprises belonging to Europeans (the British in particular) as well as the main [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church in the city and petrol stations, were targeted and set ablaze.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=185-186}} Demonstrations held in front of the British political residency called for the dismissal of Charles Belgrave, who was later dismissed by the direct intervention of the [[Foreign Office]] the following year.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=116}} A subsequent crackdown on the NUC led to the dissolution of the body. Another [[March Intifada|anti-British uprising]] erupted in March 1965, though predominately led by students aspiring for independence rather than by Arab nationalists.{{efn|These student protests were led by intellectuals and poets such as [[Qassim Haddad]].{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=227}} }} In 1968, the British announced their withdrawal from Bahrain by 1971.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=226}} The newly independent [[State of Bahrain]] designated Manama as the capital city.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=227}}

[[File:Protesters camped out infront of the Pearl Roundabout in Bahrain.jpg|thumb|Protesters at the Pearl Roundabout just before it was demolished.]]
Post-independence Manama was characterised by the rapid urbanisation of the city and the swallowing-up of neighboring villages and hamlets into a single urbanised area, incorporating new neighbourhoods such as [[Adliya]] and [[Salmaniya]]. The construction boom attracted large numbers of foreigners from the [[Indian subcontinent]] and by 1981, foreigners outnumbered Bahrainis two-to-one.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=229}} The construction of the [[Diplomatic Area]] district in the city's northeast helped facilitate diversification of the country's economy from oil by exploiting the lucrative financial industry. Financial institutions in the district numbered 187 by 1986. The scarcity of land suitable for construction led to [[land reclamation]].{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=206}} Religious activism migrated from Manama to the suburban districts of [[Bani Jamra]], [[Diraz]] and [[Bilad Al Qadeem]], hotspots of unrest in the [[1990s uprising in Bahrain|1990s uprising]] that called for the reinstatement of an elected parliament.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=230}} In 2001, the [[National Action Charter of Bahrain|National Action Charter]], presented by King [[Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa]] was approved by Bahrainis. The charter led to the first [[Bahraini general election, 2002|parliamentary]] and municipal elections in decades.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=230}} Further elections in 2006 and 2010 led to the election of Islamist parties, [[Al Wefaq]], [[Al-Menbar Islamic Society|Al Menbar]], and [[Al Asalah]], as well as independent candidates.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2009|p=230}} In 2011, a [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|month-long uprising]] led to the intervention of [[Peninsula Shield Force|GCC forces]] and the proclamation of a three-month [[state of emergency]]. The [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]] published a 500-page report on the events of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|url=http://www.bici.org.bh/|access-date=14 September 2013}}</ref>

== Economy ==
{{Main article|Economy of Bahrain}}
[[File:Manama Fog.jpg|thumb|left|Central Manama]]
[[File:BAHRAIN FINANCIAL HARBOUR.jpg|thumb|The [[Bahrain Financial Harbour]] in Manama.]]
Manama is the focal point of the Bahraini economy. While petroleum has decreased in importance in recent years due to depleting reserves and growth in other industries, it is still the mainstay of the economy. [[Heavy industry]] (e.g. aluminium [[smelting]], ship repair), banking and finance, and tourism are among the industries which have experienced recent growth. Several multinationals have facilities and offices in and around Manama.<ref name="cia">[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/bahrain/ CIA World Factbook&nbsp;– Bahrain (retrieved 2 December 2006)]</ref> The primary industry in Manama itself is financial services, with over two hundred financial institutions and banks based in the [[Central Business District, Manama|CBD]] and the [[Diplomatic Area]]. Manama is a financial hub for the Persian Gulf region and a center of [[Islamic banking]].  There is also a large retail sector in the shopping malls around [[Seef]], while the center of Manama is dominated by small workshops and traders.

Manama's economy in the early 20th century relied heavily on [[Pearl hunting|pearling]]; in 1907, the pearling industry was estimated to include 917 boats providing employment for up to 18,000 people. [[Shipbuilding]] also employed several hundred in both Manama and [[Muharraq]]. The estimated income earned from pearling in 1926 and subsequent years prior to the [[Great Depression]] was £1.5&nbsp;million annually. [[Custom duties]] and [[tariff]]s served as the prime source of revenue for the government. With the onset of the Great Depression, the collapse of the pearling industry and the [[First Oil Well, Bahrain|discovery of oil]] in 1932, the country's economy began to shift towards oil.{{sfn|Al-Nabi|2012|p=20}}

Historically, the ports at Manama were of poor reputation. The British described the ports importing systems as being "very bad – goods were exposed to the weather and there were long delays in delivery", in 1911. Indians began maintaining the ports and new resources were built on site, improving the situation. As of 1920, Manama was one of the main exporters of [[Bahrain Pearling Trail|Bahrain pearls]], attracting [[steamship]]s from India. During this time, they also imported goods from India and from other regional countries. They imported rice, textiles, [[ghee]], coffee, dates, tea, tobacco, fuel, and livestock. They exported less of a variety, with a focus on pearls, [[oyster]]s, and [[sailcloth]]. For the year of 1911–12, Manama was visited by 52 steamships, the majority being British and the rest Turkish-Arabian.<ref name=Prothero73>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

The role of Manama as a regional port city in the Persian Gulf made it a hub for migrant workers in search of a better living. As a result, Manama has often been described, both in the pre-oil and post-oil era, as a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city.{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=191}} In 1904, it was estimated that Manama's population numbered 25,000, out of which half were believed to have been foreigners from [[Basra]], [[Najd]], [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]] and [[Iran]], as well as from India and Europe.{{sfn|Fuccaro|2005|p=44}}

===Religion===

The two main branches of [[Islam]], [[Shia Islam]] and [[Sunni Islam]], coexisted in Manama for centuries and are represented by distinct ethnic groups. The Shia community is represented by the native Arab [[Baharna]], the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Hasawis]] and [[Qatif]]is of mainland Arabia and the Persian [[Persians in Bahrain|Ajam]].{{sfn|Ben Hamouche|2008|p=191}} The Sunni community is represented by Arab [[Bedouin]] tribes who migrated in the eighteenth century along with the [[Bani Utbah]] and the [[Huwala]].

Manama is the main hub of the country's road network. At the moment the city's road network is undergoing substantial development to ameliorate the situation of traffic in the city.  Due to the fact that it is the capital and the main city in the country, where most of the government and the commercial offices and facilities are established, along with the entertainment centers, and the country's fast growth, vehicle population is increasing rapidly.

The widening of roads in the old districts of Manama and the development of a national network linking the capital to other settlements commenced as early as the arrival of the first car in 1914.<ref name=Yasser>{{cite book|last=Elsheshtawy|first=Yasser|title=The evolving Arab city: tradition, modernity and urban development|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134128211|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8Zz-2AtuIwC&pg=PA198 |year=2011}}</ref> The continuous increase in the number of cars from 395 in 1944,<ref name=Yasser/> to 3,379 in 1954 and to 18,372 cars in 1970<ref name=Yasser/> caused [[urban development]] to primarily focus on expanding the road network, widening [[carriageway]]s and the establishment of more parking spaces.<ref name=Yasser/> Many tracks previously laid in the pre-oil era (prior to the 1930s) were resurfaced and widened, turning them into 'road arteries'. Initial widening of the roads started in the [[Manama Souq]] district, widening its main roads by demolishing encroaching houses.<ref name=Yasser/>

A series of [[ring roads]] were constructed (Isa al Kabeer avenue in the 1930s, Exhibition avenue in the 1960s and Al Fateh highway in the 1980s<ref name=Yasser/>), to push back the [[coastline]] and extend the city area in belt-like forms.<ref name=Yasser/> To the north, the foreshore used to be around ''Government Avenue'' in the 1920s but it shifted to a new road, ''King Faisal Road'', in the early 1930s which became the coastal road.<ref name=Yasser/> To the east, a bridge connected Manama to Muharraq since 1929, a new causeway was built in 1941 which replaced the old wooden bridge.<ref name=Yasser/> Transits between the two islands peaked after the construction of the [[Bahrain International Airport]] in 1932.<ref name=Yasser/>

To the south of Manama, roads connected groves, lagoons and marshes of [[Hoora]], [[Adliya]], [[Gudaibiya]] and [[Juffair]].<ref name=Yasser/> Villages such as [[Mahooz]], [[Ghuraifa]], [[Seqaya]] served as the end of these roads. To the west, a major highway was built that linked Manama to the isolated village port of [[Budaiya]],<ref name=Yasser/> this highway crossed through the '[[green belt]]' villages of [[Sanabis]], [[Jidhafs]] and [[Duraz]].<ref name=Yasser/> To the south, a road was built that connected Manama to [[Riffa]]. The discovery of oil accelerated the growth of the city's road network.<ref name=Yasser/>

[[File:Manama Cityline.jpg|thumb|left|Manama cityline]]

The four main islands and all the towns and villages are linked by well-constructed roads. There were {{convert|3164|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of roadways in 2002, of which {{convert|2433|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} were paved. A [[causeway]] stretching over {{convert|2.8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, connect Manama with [[Muharraq Island]], and another bridge joins [[Sitra]] to the main island. A four-lane highway atop a {{convert|24|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} [[causeway]], linking [[Bahrain]] with the [[Saudi Arabia]]n mainland via the island of [[Umm an-Nasan]] was completed in December 1986, and financed by [[Saudi Arabia]]. In 2000, there were 172,684 passenger vehicles and 41,820 commercial vehicles.

Bahrain's port of [[Mina Salman]] can accommodate 16 oceangoing vessels drawing up to {{convert|11|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. In 2001, Bahrain had a merchant fleet of eight ships of 1,000 [[Gross Tonnage|GT]] or over, totaling 270,784 GT. Private vehicles and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city.

=== Buses ===
[[File:BahrainInternationalAirport01.jpeg|thumb|Bahrain International Airport]]
Manama has a bus service that launched on 1 April 2015, with a fleet of 141 [[MAN Truck & Bus|MAN buses]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Al Omari|first1=Ahmed|title=Clean, comfortable and punctual...|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=396005|access-date=27 May 2015|agency=Gulf Daily News|date=16 February 2015}}</ref> Regulated by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Bahrain)|Ministry of Transportation]], bus routes extend across Bahrain and around Manama.

=== Air transport ===
[[Bahrain International Airport]] is located on the nearby [[Muharraq Island]], approximately {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Central Business District, Manama|CBD]]. It is a premier hub airport in the Middle East. Strategically located in the Northern [[Persian Gulf]] between the major markets of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], the airport has one of the widest range and highest frequency of regional services with connections to major international destinations in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America.
Bahrain also has a military airbase, the [[Isa Air Base]], located in the south at [[Sakhir]]. This is the base of the Bahrain Defence Force, or BDF.

== Education ==
{{Main article|Education in Bahrain}}
{{See also|List of schools in Bahrain}}

[[File:Applied Science University, Bahrain.jpeg|thumb|The clock tower of the Applied Science University building]]

Quranic schools were the only source of education in Bahrain prior to the 20th century; such schools were primarily dedicated to the study of the [[Qur'an]].<ref name=MoE>{{cite web|title=History |url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx |publisher=Ministry of Education – Bahrain |access-date=20 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118203321/http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx |archive-date=18 January 2013 }}</ref> The first modern school to open in the country was a [[missionary]] elementary school set up in 1892 (according to one account) in Manama by the [[Reformed Church in America]], with the school's syllabus comprising English, Mathematics and the study of Christianity. Leading merchants in the country sent their children to the school until it was closed down in 1933 due to financial difficulties.{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=59}} The school reopened some years later under the name of [[Al Raja School]] where it operates till the present day. In addition to the American Mission School, another foreign private school was opened in 1910; Al-Ittihad school, funded by the [[Persians in Bahrain|Persian community of Bahrain]].{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=60}}

Following the end of the [[First World War]], [[Western culture|Western ideas]] became more widespread in the country, culminating in the opening of the first [[state school|public school]] of Bahrain, Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia Boys school, in the island of [[Muharraq]] in 1919.<ref name=MoE/> The school was founded by prominent citizens of Muharraq and was endorsed by the [[Al Khalifa|Bahraini royal family]]. The country's first Education Committee was established by several leading Bahraini merchants, headed by Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa Al-Khalifa, the son of the then-ruler of Bahrain [[Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa]], who acted as the de facto [[Minister of Education]]. The Education Committee was also responsible for managing the Al-Hidaya Boys school.<ref name=MoE/> The school was, in fact, the brainchild of Shaikh Abdulla, who suggested the idea after returning from post-World War I celebrations in England.{{sfn|Shirawi|1987|p=61}}

In 1926, a second public school for boys opened up in Manama called the Jafaria School. Two years later, in 1928, the first public school for girls was established. Due to financial constraints suffered by the Education Committee, the Bahraini government took control of the schools in 1930.<ref name=MoE/>

Presently, Manama has a wide range of private and public universities and colleges such as [[Ahlia University]], [[Applied Science University (Bahrain)|Applied Science University]], [[Arab Open University]], [[Arabian Gulf University]], [[Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance]], and the [[College of Health and Sport Sciences]]. Other notable primary and secondary schools situated in the city include the [[Bahrain School]], the [[Indian School, Bahrain|Indian School]], [[Al Raja School]] amongst others.
