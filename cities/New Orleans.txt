Before the arrival of European colonists, the indigenous [[Choctaw]] people called the area of present-day New Orleans {{lang|cho|Bulbancha}}, which translates as "land of many tongues".<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Founding of New Orleans |url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/founding-new-orleans |date=2023-08-02 |access-date=2024-10-17 |website=American Battlefield Trust}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=What’s in a Name?

In his book {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Louisiane}}, [[Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz]] wrote that the indigenous name referred to the [[Mississippi River]] and that the use of the same name for the settlement relates to Native American concepts of the close interaction between rivers and their surrounding land.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bulbancha |url=https://64parishes.org/entry/bulbancha |last=Darensbourg |first=Jeffery U. |date=2024-05-01 |access-date=2024-10-17 |website=64 Parishes}}</ref>

The name of New Orleans derives from the original French name, {{lang|fr|La Nouvelle-Orléans}}, which was given to the city in honor of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], who served as [[Louis XV]]'s regent from 1715 to 1723.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=French History in New Orleans |url=https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/multicultural/cultures/french/ |access-date=2020-10-28 |website=www.neworleans.com |archive-date=October 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031142840/https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/multicultural/cultures/french/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The French city of [[Orléans]] itself is named after the [[Roman emperor]] [[Aurelian]], originally being known as Aurelianum. Thus, by extension, since New Orleans is also named after Aurelian, its name in Latin would translate to Nova Aurelia.

Following the defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], France formally transferred the possession of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to [[History of Spain (1700–1808)|Spain]], with which France had secretly signed the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] a year earlier, in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1763. The Spanish renamed the city {{lang|es|Nueva Orleans}} ({{IPA|es|ˌnweβa oɾleˈans|pron}}), which was used until 1800.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/history/history-of-new-orleans-by-period/ |title=History of New Orleans |access-date=2022-07-04 |website=www.neworleans.com |archive-date=August 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220819015712/https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/history/history-of-new-orleans-by-period/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The United States, which had [[Louisiana Purchase|acquired possession]] from [[French First Republic|France]] in 1803, adopted the French name and anglicized it to ''New Orleans''.

New Orleans has several nicknames, including these:

As a French colony, [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] faced struggles with numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]], who were navigating the competing interests of France, Spain, and England, as well as traditional rivals. Notably, the [[Natchez people|Natchez]], whose traditional lands were along the Mississippi near the modern city of [[Natchez, Mississippi]], had a series of wars culminating in the [[Natchez revolt|Natchez Revolt]] that began in 1729 with the Natchez overrunning [[Fort Rosalie]]. Approximately 230 French colonists were killed and the Natchez settlement destroyed, causing fear and concern in New Orleans and the rest of the territory.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Slave Resistance in Natchez, Mississippi (1719–1861) {{!}} Mississippi History Now |url=http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/58/slave-resistance-in-natchez-mississippi-1719-1861 |access-date=2020-10-28 |website=mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us |archive-date=October 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026070753/http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/58/slave-resistance-in-natchez-mississippi-1719-1861 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In retaliation, then-governor [[Étienne Perier (governor)|Étienne Perier]] launched a campaign to [[Genocide of indigenous peoples|completely destroy]] the Natchez nation and its Native allies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gayarré |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Gayarré |title=History of Louisiana: The French Domination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3IFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA447 |volume=1 |year=1854 |publisher=Redfield |location=New York, New York |pages=447–450 |access-date=August 14, 2021 |archive-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240110084803/https://books.google.com/books?id=p3IFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA447#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> By 1731, the Natchez people had been killed, enslaved, or dispersed among other tribes, but the campaign soured relations between France and the territory's Native Americans leading directly into the [[Chickasaw Wars]] of the 1730s.{{sfn|Gayarré|1854|page=450}}

Relations with Louisiana's Native American population remained a concern into the 1740s for governor [[Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. In the early 1740s traders from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] crossed into the Appalachian Mountains. The Native American tribes would now operate dependent on which of various European colonists would most benefit them. Several of these tribes and especially the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]] would trade goods and gifts for their loyalty.<ref>{{cite book |title=Louisiana: A History |edition=6th |editor1-last=Wall |editor1-first=Bennett H. |editor2-last=Rodrigue |editor2-first=John C. |last1=Cummins |first1=Light Townsend |author-link1=Light Townsend Cummins |last2=Kheher Schafer |first2=Judith |last3=Haas |first3=Edward F. |last4=Kurtz |first4=Micahel L. |year=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQPZAQAAQBAJ |page=59 |isbn=9781118619292 |access-date=October 28, 2020 |archive-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240110084820/https://books.google.com/books?id=aQPZAQAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> The economic issue in the colony, which continued under Vaudreuil, resulted in many raids by Native American tribes, taking advantage of the French weakness. In 1747 and 1748, the Chickasaw would raid along the east bank of the Mississippi all the way south to [[Baton Rouge]]. These raids would often force residents of French Louisiana to take refuge in New Orleans proper.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Inability to find labor was the most pressing issue in the young colony. The colonists turned to [[Slavery in the colonial United States|sub-Saharan African slaves]] to make their investments in Louisiana profitable. In the late 1710s the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] imported enslaved Africans into the colony. This led to the biggest shipment in 1716 where several trading ships appeared with slaves as cargo to the local residents in a one-year span. By 1724, the large number of blacks in Louisiana prompted the institutionalizing of laws governing slavery within the colony.<ref>{{Cite web |last=BlackPast |date=2007-07-28 |title=(1724) Louisiana's Code Noir |url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/louisianas-code-noir-1724/ |access-date=2020-10-28 |language=en-US |archive-date=October 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027190710/https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/louisianas-code-noir-1724/ |url-status=live }}</ref> These laws required that slaves be baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, slaves be married in the church; the slave law formed in the 1720s is known as the [[Code Noir]], which would bleed into the antebellum period of the American South as well. Louisiana slave culture had its own distinct Afro-Creole society that called on past cultures and the situation for slaves in the [[New World]]. Afro-Creole was present in religious beliefs and the [[Louisiana Creole]] language. The religion most associated with this period was called [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=From Benin to Bourbon Street: A Brief History of Louisiana Voodoo |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/r7g5ar/from-benin-to-bourbon-street-a-brief-history-of-louisiana-voodoo |access-date=2020-10-28 |website=www.vice.com |date=October 5, 2014 |language=en |archive-date=November 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101201752/https://www.vice.com/en/article/r7g5ar/from-benin-to-bourbon-street-a-brief-history-of-louisiana-voodoo |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The True History and Faith Behind Voodoo |url=http://www.frenchquarter.com/true-history-faith-behind-voodoo/ |access-date=2020-10-28 |website=FrenchQuarter.com |language=en-US |archive-date=November 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101013201/https://www.frenchquarter.com/true-history-faith-behind-voodoo/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the city of New Orleans an inspiring mixture of foreign influences created a melting pot of culture that is still celebrated today. By the end of French colonization in Louisiana, New Orleans was recognized commercially in the Atlantic world. Its inhabitants traded across the French commercial system. New Orleans was a hub for this trade both physically and culturally because it served as the exit point to the rest of the globe for the interior of the North American continent. In one instance the French government established a chapter house of sisters in New Orleans. The [[History of the Ursulines in New Orleans|Ursuline sisters]] after being sponsored by the [[Company of the Indies]], founded a convent in the city in 1727.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Ursulines of Louisiana |last=Cruzat |first=Heloise Hulse |url=https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/cruzat/cruzat--ursulines.html |access-date=2020-10-28 |journal=The Louisiana Historical Quarterly |year=1919 |volume=2 |number=1 |archive-date=March 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210316070359/https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/cruzat/cruzat--ursulines.html |url-status=live }}</ref> At the end of the colonial era, the Ursuline Academy maintained a house of 70 boarding and 100 day students.

Another notable example is the street plan and architecture still distinguishing New Orleans today. French Louisiana had early architects in the province who were trained as military engineers and were now assigned to design government buildings. Pierre Le Blond de Tour and [[Adrien de Pauger]], for example, planned many early fortifications, along with the street plan for the city of New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pauger's Savvy Move |url=https://richcampanella.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/article_Campanella_Preservation-in-Print_2014_May_Pauger-Savvy-Move.pdf |access-date=October 28, 2020 |website=richcampanella.com |archive-date=June 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609051806/https://richcampanella.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/article_Campanella_Preservation-in-Print_2014_May_Pauger-Savvy-Move.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> After them in the 1740s, Ignace François Broutin, as engineer-in-chief of Louisiana, reworked the architecture of New Orleans with an extensive public works program. French policy-makers in Paris attempted to set political and economic norms for New Orleans. The city acted autonomously in much of its cultural and physical aspects, but stayed in communication with the foreign trends as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

The [[Louisiana (New France)|French colony]] of Louisiana was ceded to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Empire]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], following [[France in the Seven Years' War|France's defeat]] by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in the [[Seven Years' War]]. After the French relinquished West Louisiana to the Spanish, New Orleans merchants attempted to ignore Spanish rule and even re-institute French control on the colony. The citizens of New Orleans held a series of public meetings during 1765 to keep the populace in opposition of the establishment of Spanish rule. Anti-Spanish passions in New Orleans reached their highest level after two years of Spanish administration in Louisiana. On October 27, 1768, a mob of local residents, spiked the guns guarding New Orleans and [[Louisiana Rebellion of 1768|took control of the city from the Spanish]].{{sfn|Cummins|Kheher Schafer|Haas|Kurtz|2014|page=70}} The rebellion organized a group to sail for Paris, where it met with officials of the French government.

====Slave rebellion ====
On January 8-11, 1811, about 500 enslaved Africans in St. Charles and St. John the Baptist parishes rose up in rebellion against their enslavers, killing two white men in the process. They proceeded to march south toward New Orleans and were eventually controlled by the local militia, with numerous casualties on both sides.
The uprising has been called the "largest slave rebellion in US history."<ref> {{cite book |last=Rasmussen |first=Daniel |title= American Uprising: The Untold Story of America's Largest Slave Revolt |url= |year=2012 |publisher=Harper Potential |isbn=9780061995224 |access-date= }}</ref>

During the final campaign of the [[War of 1812]], the British sent a force of 11,000 in an attempt to capture New Orleans. Despite great challenges, General [[Andrew Jackson]], with support from the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], successfully cobbled together a force of [[United States Militia|militia]] from Louisiana and [[Mississippi Territory|Mississippi]], [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] regulars, a large contingent of [[Tennessee]] state militia, [[Kentucky]] [[American pioneers|frontiersmen]] and local [[privateer]]s (the latter led by the [[Piracy|pirate]] [[Jean Lafitte]]), to decisively defeat the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], led by [[Edward Pakenham|Sir Edward Pakenham]], in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815.<ref name="Groom2007"/>

The armies had not learned of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which had been signed on December 24, 1814 (however, the treaty did not call for cessation of hostilities until after both governments had ratified it. The U.S. government ratified it on February 16, 1815). The fighting in Louisiana began in December 1814 and did not end until late January, after the Americans held off the [[Royal Navy]] during a ten-day [[Siege of Fort St. Philip (1815)|siege of Fort St. Philip]] (the Royal Navy went on to capture [[Fort Bowyer]] near [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], before the commanders received news of the peace treaty).<ref name="Groom2007">{{cite book |last=Groom |first=Winston |title=Patriotic Fire: Andrew Jackson and Jean Laffite at the Battle of New Orleans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nE3S3TnCGk4C |year=2007 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-1-4000-9566-7 |access-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240110084854/https://books.google.com/books?id=nE3S3TnCGk4C |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Port===
[[File:Hippolyte Sebron - Bateaux A Vapeur Géants 1853.jpg|thumb|Mississippi River [[Steamboats of the Mississippi|steamboats]] at New Orleans, 1853]]

As a [[port]], New Orleans played a major role during the [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] period in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The port handled commodities for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries, which were warehoused and transferred in New Orleans to smaller vessels and distributed along the Mississippi River watershed. The river was filled with steamboats, flatboats and sailing ships. Despite its role in the [[History of slavery|slave trade]], New Orleans at the time also had the largest and most prosperous community of free persons of color in the nation, who were often educated, middle-class property owners.<ref name="pbsjazz">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/places/places_new_orleans.htm |title=New Orleans: The Birthplace of Jazz |website=PBS – JAZZ A Film By Ken Burns |format=primarily excerpted from Jazz: A History of America's Music |access-date=May 17, 2006 |archive-date=August 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812000720/http://www.pbs.org/jazz/places/places_new_orleans.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=History of Les Gens De Couleur Libres |url=http://www.creolehistory.com/ |access-date=May 17, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522221017/http://www.creolehistory.com/ |archive-date=May 22, 2006}}</ref>

Dwarfing the other cities in the Antebellum South, New Orleans had the U.S.' largest slave market. The market expanded after the United States ended the international trade in 1808. Two-thirds of the more than one million slaves brought to the [[Deep South]] arrived via [[forced migration]] in the domestic slave trade. The money generated by the sale of slaves in the [[Upper South]] has been estimated at 15 percent of the value of the staple crop economy. The slaves were collectively valued at half a billion dollars. The trade spawned an ancillary economy—transportation, housing and clothing, fees, etc., estimated at 13.5 percent of the price per person, amounting to tens of billions of dollars (2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) during the antebellum period, with New Orleans as a prime beneficiary.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2, 6</ref>

According to historian Paul Lachance,

{{blockquote|the addition of white immigrants [from Saint-Domingue] to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain a majority of the white population until almost 1830. If a substantial proportion of free persons of color and slaves had not also spoken French, however, the [[Gaul|Gallic]] community would have become a minority of the total population as early as 1820.{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p=159}}}}

After the Louisiana Purchase, numerous [[English Americans|Anglo-Americans]] migrated to the city. The population doubled in the 1830s and by 1840, New Orleans had become the nation's wealthiest and the third-most populous city, after [[New York City|New York]] and [[Baltimore]].<ref>Lewis, Peirce F., ''New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape'', Santa Fe, 2003, p. 175</ref> German and Irish immigrants began arriving in the 1840s, working as port laborers. In this period, the state legislature passed more restrictions on [[manumission]]s of slaves and virtually ended it in 1852.<ref name="manumission"/>

In the 1850s, white Francophones remained an intact and vibrant community in New Orleans. They maintained instruction in French in two of the city's four school districts (all served white students).{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 166}} In 1860, the city had 13,000 free people of color (''gens de couleur libres''), the class of free, mostly [[Multiracial Americans|mixed-race]] people that expanded in number during French and Spanish rule. They set up some private schools for their children. The census recorded 81 percent of the free people of color as [[mulatto]], a term used to cover all degrees of mixed race.<ref name="manumission">[http://www.kotlikoff.net/sites/default/files/The%20Manumission%20of%20Slaves%20in%20New%20Orleans,%201827-1846.pdf Lawrence J.

Throughout New Orleans' history, until the early 20th century when medical and scientific advances ameliorated the situation, the city suffered repeated [[List of epidemics and pandemics|epidemic]]s of [[yellow fever]] and other tropical and [[Infection|infectious diseases]].<ref>{{cite news |title=How Yellow Fever Turned New Orleans Into The 'City Of The Dead' |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/10/31/415535913/how-yellow-fever-turned-new-orleans-into-the-city-of-the-dead |work=NPR |date=October 31, 2018 |access-date=July 21, 2023 |archive-date=June 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230628214054/https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/10/31/415535913/how-yellow-fever-turned-new-orleans-into-the-city-of-the-dead |url-status=live }}</ref> In the first half of the 19th century, yellow fever epidemics killed over 150,000 people in New Orleans.<ref>{{cite news |title=A lesson from history: How the yellow fever epidemic changed society |url=https://www.pleasantonweekly.com/news/2020/05/10/a-lesson-from-history-how-the-yellow-fever-epidemic-changed-society#:~:text=Yellow%20fever%20killed%20more%20than,with%20references%20to%20yellow%20fever. |work=[[Palo Alto Weekly]] |date=May 10, 2020 |access-date=July 21, 2023 |archive-date=July 21, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230721161220/https://www.pleasantonweekly.com/news/2020/05/10/a-lesson-from-history-how-the-yellow-fever-epidemic-changed-society#:~:text=Yellow%20fever%20killed%20more%20than,with%20references%20to%20yellow%20fever. |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:StarvingNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The starving people of New Orleans under Union occupation during the Civil War, 1862]]

As the Creole elite feared, the [[American Civil War]] changed their world. In April 1862, following the city's occupation by the Union Navy after the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]] – a respected Massachusetts lawyer serving in that state's militia – was appointed military governor. New Orleans residents supportive of the Confederacy nicknamed him "Beast" Butler, because of an order he issued. After his troops had been assaulted and harassed in the streets by women still loyal to the Confederate cause, his order warned that such future occurrences would result in his men treating such women as those "plying their avocation in the streets", implying that they would treat the women like prostitutes. Accounts of this spread widely. He also came to be called "Spoons" Butler because of the alleged looting that his troops did while occupying the city, during which time he himself supposedly pilfered silver flatware.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Benjamin Butler |url=https://64parishes.org/entry/benjamin-butler |access-date=2021-07-29 |website=64 Parishes |language=en |archive-date=June 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616112819/https://64parishes.org/entry/benjamin-butler/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Significantly, Butler abolished French-language instruction in city schools. Statewide measures in 1864 and, after the war, 1868 further strengthened the English-only policy imposed by federal representatives. With the predominance of English speakers, that language had already become dominant in business and government.{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 166}} By the end of the 19th century, French usage had faded. It was also under pressure from Irish, Italian and German immigrants.{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 180}} However, as late as 1902 "one-fourth of the population of the city spoke French in ordinary daily intercourse, while another two-fourths was able to understand the language perfectly,"<ref>''[[Leslie's Weekly]]'', December 11, 1902</ref> and as late as 1945, many elderly Creole women spoke no English.<ref>Robert Tallant & Lyle Saxon, ''Gumbo Ya-Ya: Folk Tales of Louisiana'', Louisiana Library Commission: 1945, p. 178</ref> The last major French language newspaper, ''[[L'Abeille de la Nouvelle-Orléans]]'' (New Orleans Bee), ceased publication on December 27, 1923, after 96 years.<ref name="Brasseaux2005">{{cite book |last=Brasseaux |first=Carl A. |title=French, Cajun, Creole, Houma: A Primer on Francophone Louisiana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2IAZ7563soC&pg=PA32 |year=2005 |page=32 |publisher=LSU Press |isbn=978-0-8071-3036-0 |access-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240110084808/https://books.google.com/books?id=j2IAZ7563soC&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> According to some sources, ''Le Courrier de la Nouvelle Orleans'' continued until 1955.<ref>''New Orleans City Guide''.

As the city was captured and occupied early in the war, it was spared the destruction through warfare suffered by many other cities of the [[Southern United States|American South]]. The [[Union Army]] eventually extended its control north along the [[Mississippi River]] and along the coastal areas. As a result, most of the southern portion of Louisiana was originally exempted from the liberating provisions of the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Large numbers of rural ex-slaves and some free people of color from the city volunteered for the first regiments of Black troops in the War. Led by Brigadier General [[Daniel Ullman]] (1810–1892), of the 78th Regiment of New York State Volunteers Militia, they were known as the "[[United States Colored Troops|Corps d'Afrique]]". While that name had been used by a militia before the war, that group was composed of [[free people of color]]. The new group was made up mostly of former slaves. They were supplemented in the last two years of the War by newly organized [[United States Colored Troops]], who played an increasingly important part in the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ustica.org/san_bartolomeo/catalog/civilwar.htm |title=Usticesi in the United States Civil War |publisher=The Ustica Connection |date=March 22, 2003 |access-date=July 29, 2018 |archive-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216050549/http://www.ustica.org/san_bartolomeo/catalog/civilwar.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Violence throughout the South, especially the [[Memphis Riots of 1866]] followed by the [[New Orleans Riot]] in the same year, led Congress to pass the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], extending the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color. Louisiana and [[Texas]] were put under the authority of the "[[Fifth Military District]]" of the United States during Reconstruction. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868. Its Constitution of 1868 granted [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal male suffrage]] and established universal [[State school|public education]]. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, lieutenant governor [[P.B.S. Pinchback]], who was of [[mixed race]], succeeded [[Henry C. Warmouth|Henry Clay Warmouth]] for a brief period as Republican governor of Louisiana, becoming the first governor of African descent of a U.S. state (the next African American to serve as governor of a U.S. state was [[Douglas Wilder]], elected in Virginia in 1989). New Orleans operated a racially integrated [[New Orleans Public Schools|public school system]] during this period.

Wartime damage to [[levees]] and cities along the Mississippi River adversely affected southern crops and trade. The federal government contributed to restoring infrastructure. The nationwide financial recession and [[Panic of 1873]] adversely affected businesses and slowed economic recovery.
[[File:White_and_black_dockworkers_rest_on_cotton_bales_in_New_Orleans_in_1902.jpg|thumb|187x187px|Black and white [[New Orleans dock workers and unionization|dockworkers]] resting on cotton bales.]]
From 1868, elections in Louisiana were marked by violence, as white insurgents tried to suppress black voting and disrupt [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] gatherings. The disputed 1872 gubernatorial election resulted in conflicts that ran for years. The "[[White League]]", an insurgent paramilitary group that supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was organized in 1874 and operated in the open, violently suppressing the black vote and running off Republican officeholders. In 1874, in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]], 5,000 members of the White League fought with city police to take over the state offices for the Democratic candidate for governor, holding them for three days. By 1876, such tactics resulted in the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the so-called [[Redeemers]], regaining political control of the state legislature. The federal government gave up and withdrew its troops in 1877, ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].

In 1892 the racially integrated unions of New Orleans led a [[1892 New Orleans general strike|general strike in the city]] from November 8 to 12, shutting down the city & winning the vast majority of their demands.<ref>Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 2: From the Founding of the American Federation of Labor to the Emergence of American Imperialism,'' 1955, p. 203.</ref><ref>Cook, "The Typographical Union and the New Orleans General Strike of 1892," ''Louisiana History,'' 1983; "Labor Trouble In New-Orleans," ''New York Times,'' November 5, 1892.</ref>

===Jim Crow era===
[[Dixiecrats]] passed [[Jim Crow]] laws, establishing [[racial segregation]] in public facilities. In 1889, the legislature passed a [[constitutional amendment]] incorporating a "[[grandfather clause]]" that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] freedmen as well as the propertied people of color [[Manumission|manumitted]] before the war. Unable to vote, African Americans could not serve on juries or in local office, and were closed out of formal politics for generations. The Southern U.S. was ruled by a white Democratic Party. Public schools were [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] and remained so until 1960.

New Orleans' large community of well-educated, often French-speaking [[free persons of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who had been free prior to the Civil War, fought against Jim Crow. They organized the ''Comité des Citoyens'' (Citizens Committee) to work for civil rights. As part of their legal campaign, they recruited one of their own, [[Homer Plessy]], to test whether Louisiana's newly enacted Separate Car Act was constitutional. Plessy boarded a commuter train departing New Orleans for [[Covington, Louisiana]], sat in the car reserved for whites only, and was arrested. The case resulting from this incident, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1896. The court ruled that "[[separate but equal]]" accommodations were constitutional, effectively upholding Jim Crow measures.

In practice, African American public schools and facilities were underfunded across the South. The Supreme Court ruling contributed to this period as the [[Nadir of American race relations|nadir of race relations]] in the United States. The rate of [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] of black men was high across the South, as other states also disfranchised blacks and sought to impose Jim Crow. Nativist prejudices also surfaced. [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|Anti-Italian]] sentiment in 1891 contributed to the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynchings of 11 Italians]], some of whom had been acquitted of the murder of the police chief. Some were shot and killed in the jail where they were detained. It was the largest mass lynching in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web |ref={{harvid|Library of Congress}} |title=Immigration / Italian |website=Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html |access-date=December 29, 2017 |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628191345/http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Gambino2000">{{cite book |last=Gambino |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Gambino |title=Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jA9-dmAsoMwC |year=2000 |publisher=Guernica Editions |isbn=978-1-55071-103-5 |access-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240110084854/https://books.google.com/books?id=jA9-dmAsoMwC |url-status=live }}</ref> In July 1900 the city was swept by white mobs rioting after Robert Charles, a young African American, killed a policeman and temporarily escaped.

New Orleans' economic and population zenith in relation to other American cities occurred in the antebellum period. It was the nation's fifth-largest city in 1860 (after New York, [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and Baltimore) and was significantly larger than all other southern cities.<ref name="Lewis-2003–175">Lewis, Peirce F., ''New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape'', Santa Fe, 2003, p. 175.</ref> From the mid-19th century onward rapid economic growth shifted to other areas, while New Orleans' relative importance steadily declined. The growth of railways and highways decreased river traffic, diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets.<ref name="Lewis-2003–175" /> Thousands of the most ambitious [[Person of color|people of color]] left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] around [[World War II]] and after, many for [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] destinations. From the late 1800s, most censuses recorded New Orleans slipping down the ranks in the list of largest American cities (New Orleans' population still continued to increase throughout the period, but at a slower rate than before the Civil War).

By the mid-20th century, New Orleanians recognized that their city was no longer the leading urban area in the South. By 1950, [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], and [[Atlanta]] exceeded New Orleans in size, and in 1960 [[Miami]] eclipsed New Orleans, even as the latter's population reached its historic peak.<ref name="Lewis-2003–175" /> As with other older American cities, highway construction and suburban development drew residents from the center city to newer housing outside. The 1970 census recorded the first absolute decline in population since the city became part of the United States in 1803. The [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Greater New Orleans metropolitan area]] continued expanding in population, albeit more slowly than other major [[Sun Belt]] cities. While the [[Port of New Orleans|port]] remained one of the nation's largest, automation and [[containerization]] cost many jobs. The city's former role as banker to the South was supplanted by larger peer cities. New Orleans' economy had always been based more on trade and financial services than on manufacturing, but the city's relatively small manufacturing sector also shrank after World War II. Despite some economic development successes under the administrations of [[DeLesseps Story Morrison|DeLesseps "Chep" Morrison]] (1946–1961) and [[Victor H. Schiro|Victor "Vic" Schiro]] (1961–1970), metropolitan New Orleans' growth rate consistently lagged behind more vigorous cities.

====Civil Rights movement====
During the later years of Morrison's administration, and for the entirety of Schiro's, the city was a center of the [[Civil Rights movement]]. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] was founded in New Orleans, and lunch counter sit-ins were held in [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] department stores. A prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954). When six-year-old [[Ruby Bridges]] integrated [[William Frantz Elementary School]] in the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|Ninth Ward]], she was the first child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the South. Much controversy preceded the [[1956 Sugar Bowl]] at [[Tulane Stadium]], when the [[1955 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pitt Panthers]], with African-American fullback [[Bobby Grier (Pittsburgh Panthers)|Bobby Grier]] on the roster, met the [[1955 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]].<ref name=fcflu>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cs9RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C2wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4796%2C5131560 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |last=Sell |first=Jack |title=Panthers defeat flu; face Ga.

The Civil Rights movement's success in gaining federal passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] renewed constitutional rights, including voting for blacks. Together, these resulted in the most far-reaching changes in New Orleans' 20th century history.<ref>Germany, Kent B., ''New Orleans After the Promises: Poverty, Citizenship and the Search for the Great Society'', Athens, 2007, pp. 3–5</ref> Though legal and civil equality were re-established by the end of the 1960s, a large gap in income levels and educational attainment persisted between the city's White and African American communities.<ref name="ReferenceA">Glassman, James K., "New Orleans: I have Seen the Future, and It's Houston", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', July 1978</ref> As the middle class and wealthier members of both races left the center city, its population's income level dropped, and it became proportionately more African American. From 1980, the African American majority elected primarily officials from its own community. They struggled to narrow the gap by creating conditions conducive to the economic uplift of the African American community.

New Orleans became increasingly dependent on tourism as an economic mainstay during the administrations of [[Sidney Barthelemy]] (1986–1994) and [[Marc Morial]] (1994–2002). Relatively low levels of educational attainment, high rates of household poverty, and rising crime threatened the city's prosperity in the later decades of the century.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions aligned poorly with the changes in the late-20th century to the economy of the United States, which reflected a post-industrial, knowledge-based paradigm in which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills.

====Drainage and flood control====

In the 20th century, New Orleans' government and business leaders believed they needed to drain and develop outlying areas to provide for the city's expansion. The most ambitious development during this period was a drainage plan devised by engineer and inventor [[A. Baldwin Wood]], designed to break the surrounding swamp's stranglehold on the city's geographic expansion. Until then, urban development in New Orleans was largely limited to higher ground along the natural river levees and [[bayou]]s.

Wood's pump system allowed the city to drain huge tracts of swamp and marshland and expand into low-lying areas. Over the 20th century, rapid [[subsidence]], both natural and human-induced, resulted in these newly populated areas subsiding to several feet below sea level.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Kusky, Timothy M. |title=Why is New Orleans Sinking? |publisher=Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Saint Louis University |date=December 29, 2005 |url=http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |access-date=June 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623092455/http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |archive-date=June 23, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=O'Hanlon |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html |title=New Orleans Sits Atop Giant Landslide |publisher=Discovery Channel |date=March 31, 2006 |access-date=June 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614211349/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=June 14, 2006}}</ref>

New Orleans was vulnerable to flooding even before the city's footprint departed from the natural high ground near the Mississippi River. In the late 20th century, however, scientists and New Orleans residents gradually became aware of the city's increased vulnerability. In 1965, flooding from [[Hurricane Betsy]] killed dozens of residents, although the majority of the city remained dry. The rain-induced [[May 8th 1995 Louisiana Flood|flood of May 8, 1995]], demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system. After that event, measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade pumping capacity. By the 1980s and 1990s, scientists observed that extensive, rapid, and ongoing [[Coastal erosion in Louisiana|erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding New Orleans]], especially that related to the [[Mississippi River–Gulf Outlet Canal]], had the unintended result of leaving the city more vulnerable than before to hurricane-induced catastrophic [[storm surge]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2024}}

Because of the scale of damage, many people resettled permanently outside the area. Federal, state, and local efforts supported recovery and rebuilding in severely damaged neighborhoods. The U.S. Census Bureau in July 2006 estimated the population to be 223,000; a subsequent study estimated that 32,000 additional residents had moved to the city as of March 2007, bringing the estimated population to 255,000, approximately 56% of the pre-Katrina population level. Another estimate, based on utility usage from July 2007, estimated the population to be approximately 274,000 or 60% of the pre-Katrina population.

[[File:New Orleans Levee System.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Vertical cross-section, showing maximum levee height of {{convert|23|ft|m}}]]

New Orleans was originally settled on the river's natural [[levee]]s or high ground. After the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] built floodwalls and man-made [[levee]]s around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp. Over time, pumping of water from marshland allowed for development into lower elevation areas. Today, half of the city is at or below local mean sea level, while the other half is slightly above sea level. Evidence suggests that portions of the city may be dropping in elevation due to [[subsidence]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New Study Maps Rate of New Orleans Sinking |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-study-maps-rate-of-new-orleans-sinking/ |website=NASA |date=May 16, 2016 |access-date=16 May 2016 |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308185136/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-study-maps-rate-of-new-orleans-sinking/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Colorful houses in New Orleans.jpg|thumb|right|New Orleans contains many distinctive neighborhoods.]]

The [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]] is located immediately north and west of the Mississippi and was historically called the "American Quarter" or "American Sector". It was developed after the heart of French and Spanish settlement. It includes [[Lafayette Square, New Orleans|Lafayette Square]]. Most streets in this area fan out from a central point. Major streets include [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], Poydras Street, Tulane Avenue and Loyola Avenue. Canal Street divides the traditional "[[Downtown New Orleans|downtown]]" area from the "[[Uptown New Orleans|uptown]]" area.

Every street crossing Canal Street between the Mississippi River and [[Rampart Street]], which is the northern edge of the French Quarter, has a different name for the "uptown" and "downtown" portions. For example, [[St. Charles Avenue]], known for its street car line, is called [[Royal Street, New Orleans|Royal Street]] below Canal Street, though where it traverses the Central Business District between Canal and Lee Circle, it is properly called St. Charles Street.<ref>Brock, Eric J. ''New Orleans'', Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina (1999), pp. 108–09.</ref> Elsewhere in the city, Canal Street serves as the dividing point between the "South" and "North" portions of various streets. In the local [[wikt:parlance|parlance]] ''downtown'' means "downriver from Canal Street", while ''uptown'' means "upriver from Canal Street". Downtown neighborhoods include the French Quarter, [[Tremé]], the [[7th Ward of New Orleans|7th Ward]], [[Faubourg Marigny]], [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]] (the Upper Ninth Ward), and the Lower [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|Ninth Ward]]. [[Uptown New Orleans|Uptown]] neighborhoods include the Warehouse District, the [[Lower Garden District, New Orleans|Lower Garden District]], the [[Garden District, New Orleans|Garden District]], the [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]], the University District, [[Carrollton, Louisiana|Carrollton]], [[Gert Town, New Orleans|Gert Town]], [[Fontainebleau, New Orleans|Fontainebleau]] and [[Broadmoor, New Orleans|Broadmoor]]. However, the Warehouse and the Central Business District are frequently called "Downtown" as a specific region, as in the Downtown Development District.

Other major districts within the city include [[Bayou St. John (neighborhood)|Bayou St. John]], [[Mid-City New Orleans|Mid-City]], [[Gentilly, New Orleans|Gentilly]], [[Lakeview, New Orleans|Lakeview]], Lakefront, [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] and [[Algiers, New Orleans|Algiers]].

====Historic and residential architecture====
{{See also|Buildings and architecture of New Orleans}} New Orleans is world-famous for its abundance of architectural styles that reflect the city's multicultural heritage. Though New Orleans possesses numerous structures of national architectural significance, it is equally, if not more, revered for its enormous, largely intact (even post-Katrina) historic built environment. Twenty National Register Historic Districts have been established, and fourteen local historic districts aid in preservation. Thirteen of the districts are administered by the New Orleans Historic District Landmarks Commission (HDLC), while one—the French Quarter—is administered by the Vieux Carre Commission (VCC). Additionally, both the [[National Park Service]], via the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the HDLC have landmarked individual buildings, many of which lie outside the boundaries of existing historic districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nolamasterplan.org/documentsandrresources.asp |title=Part 2-The Plan; Section 1-How We Live; Map-Local and National Register Historic Districts |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115105708/http://www.nolamasterplan.org/documentsandrresources.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016}}</ref>

Housing styles include the [[shotgun house]] and the [[bungalow]] style. Creole cottages and townhouses, notable for their large courtyards and intricate iron balconies, line the streets of the French Quarter. American townhouses, double-gallery houses, and Raised Center-Hall Cottages are notable. [[St. Charles Avenue]] is famed for its large [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum homes]]. Its mansions are in various styles, such as [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[American colonial architecture|American Colonial]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles of [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] and [[Italianate architecture]]. New Orleans is also noted for its large, European-style Catholic cemeteries.

[[File:New Orleans Skyline from Uptown.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.5|Skyline of the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]] of New Orleans]]
For much of its history, New Orleans' skyline displayed only low- and mid-rise structures. The soft soils are susceptible to subsidence, and there was doubt about the feasibility of constructing high rises. Developments in engineering throughout the 20th century eventually made it possible to build sturdy foundations in the foundations that underlie the structures. In the 1960s, the [[2 Canal Street|World Trade Center New Orleans]] and [[Plaza Tower]] demonstrated skyscrapers' viability. [[One Shell Square]] became the city's tallest building in 1972. The oil boom of the 1970s and early 1980s redefined New Orleans' skyline with the development of the Poydras Street corridor. Most are clustered along [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] and Poydras Street in the Central Business District.

[[File:Snow in New Orleans by evreniz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Snow falls on [[St. Charles Avenue]] in December 2008.]]The climate of New Orleans is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''), with short, generally mild winters and hot, humid summers; in the 1991-2020 climate normals the USDA hardiness zone is 9b, with the coldest temperature in most years being about {{convert|27.6|°F|1}}. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|54.3|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|84|°F|1}} in August. Officially, as measured at New Orleans International Airport, temperature records range from {{convert|11|to|105|F|C}} [[December 1989 United States cold wave|on December 23, 1989]], and August 27, 2023, respectively; Audubon Park has recorded temperatures ranging from {{convert|6|°F}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 13, 1899]], up to {{convert|104|°F}} on June 24, 2009.<ref name="NWS New Orleans/Baton Rouge, LA (LIX)"/> Dewpoints in the summer months (June–August) are relatively high, ranging from {{convert|21.7|to|23.0|C|F|order=flip}}.<ref name="WMO 1961–90 KMSY"/>

The average precipitation is {{convert|62.5|in|sigfig=3}} annually; the summer months are the wettest, while October is the driest month.<ref name="NWS New Orleans/Baton Rouge, LA (LIX)"/> Precipitation in winter usually accompanies the passing of a cold front. There are a median of over 80 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs, 9 days per winter where the high does not exceed {{convert|50|°F|0}}, and less than 8 nights with freezing lows annually, although it is not uncommon for entire winter seasons to pass with no freezing temperatures at all, such as the 2003-04 winter, the 2012-13 winter, the 2015-16 winter and the consecutive winters of 2018-19 and 2019–20. It is rare for the temperature to reach {{convert|20|or|100|°F|°C}}, with the last occurrence of each being January 17, 2018, and August 27, 2023, respectively.<ref name="NWS New Orleans/Baton Rouge, LA (LIX)"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=US Department of Commerce |first=NOAA |title=2023 Summer Heat & Climatology |url=https://www.weather.gov/lix/2023summerheat |access-date=2024-07-05 |website=www.weather.gov |language=EN-US}}</ref>

New Orleans experiences snowfall only on rare occasions. A small amount of snow fell during the [[2004 Christmas Eve Snowstorm]] and again on [[Christmas]] (December 25) when a combination of rain, sleet, and snow fell on the city, leaving some bridges icy. The [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] affected New Orleans and brought {{convert|4.5|in|cm}}. Snow fell again on December 22, 1989, during the [[December 1989 United States cold wave]], when most of the city received {{convert|1|–|2|in|cm}}.

The last significant snowfall in New Orleans was on the morning of December 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCusker |first1=John |title=Sleet, snow tail off in New Orleans |url=https://www.nola.com/news/article_63526a1c-c17c-59fc-8cbe-b660bdb6ef27.html |website=nola.com |date=December 11, 2008 |access-date=February 16, 2020 |archive-date=February 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200216203249/https://www.nola.com/news/article_63526a1c-c17c-59fc-8cbe-b660bdb6ef27.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Weather box

According to a study by the [[National Academy of Engineering]] and the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], levees and floodwalls surrounding New Orleans—no matter how large or sturdy—cannot provide absolute protection against overtopping or failure in extreme events. Levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures that eliminate risk. For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major [[Flood mitigation#Protection of individual properties|floodproofing]] measures—such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level.<ref>[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12647 "Levees Cannot Fully Eliminate Risk of Flooding to New Orleans"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428070859/http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12647 |date=April 28, 2009 }} National Academy of Sciences, April 24, 2009</ref>

After Katrina the small [[Brazilian Americans|Brazilian American]] population expanded. Portuguese speakers were the second most numerous group to take [[English as a second language]] classes in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans, after Spanish speakers. Many Brazilians worked in skilled trades such as tile and flooring, although fewer worked as day laborers than other Hispanic and Latino Americans. Many had moved from Brazilian communities in the [[northeastern United States]], and Florida and Georgia. Brazilians settled throughout the metropolitan area; most were undocumented.

New Orleans' colonial history of French and Spanish settlement generated a strong [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition. Catholic missions ministered to slaves and free people of color and established schools for them. In addition, many late 19th and early 20th century European immigrants, such as the Irish, some Germans, and Italians were Catholic. Within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans]] (which includes not only the city but the surrounding parishes as well), 40% percent of the population was Roman Catholic since 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Orleans Archdiocese (Catholic-Hierarchy) |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dnewo.html#stats |access-date=September 20, 2020 |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206103615/http://catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dnewo.html#stats |url-status=live }}</ref> Catholicism is reflected in French and Spanish cultural traditions, including its many [[parochial schools]], street names, architecture and festivals, including [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]].

Jewish settlers, primarily [[Sephardim]], settled in New Orleans from the early nineteenth century. Some migrated from the communities established in the colonial years in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The merchant [[Abraham Cohen Labatt]] helped found the first Jewish congregation in New Orleans in the 1830s, which became known as the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese Jewish]] Nefutzot Yehudah congregation (he and some other members were [[Sephardic Jews]], whose ancestors had lived in Portugal and Spain). [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from eastern Europe immigrated in the late 19th and 20th centuries.

By the beginning of the 21st century, 10,000 [[Jew]]s lived in New Orleans.

===Port===
New Orleans began as a strategically located trading ''[[entrepôt]]'' and it remains, above all, a crucial transportation hub and distribution center for waterborne commerce. The [[Port of New Orleans]] is the fifth-largest in the United States based on cargo volume, and second-largest in the state after the [[Port of South Louisiana]]. It is the twelfth-largest in the U.S. based on cargo value. The Port of South Louisiana, also located in the New Orleans area, is the world's busiest in terms of bulk tonnage. When combined with Port of New Orleans, it forms the 4th-largest port system in volume. Many shipbuilding, shipping, logistics, freight forwarding and commodity brokerage firms either are based in metropolitan New Orleans or maintain a local presence.

New Orleans is located near to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and its many oil rigs. Louisiana ranks fifth among states in oil production and eighth in [[oil reserves|reserves]]. It has two of the four [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] (SPR) storage facilities: West Hackberry in [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron Parish]] and Bayou Choctaw in [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish]]. The area hosts 17 petroleum refineries, with a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, the second highest after Texas. Louisiana's numerous ports include the [[Louisiana Offshore Oil Port]] (LOOP), which is capable of receiving the largest oil tankers.

The French Quarter (known locally as "the Quarter" or ''Vieux Carré''), which was the colonial-era city and is bounded by the Mississippi River, Rampart Street, [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], and [[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]], contains popular hotels, bars and nightclubs. Notable tourist attractions in the Quarter include Bourbon Street, Jackson Square, St. Louis Cathedral, the [[French Market]] (including [[Café du Monde]], famous for [[café au lait]] and [[beignet]]s) and [[Preservation Hall]]. Also in the French Quarter is the old [[New Orleans Mint]], a former branch of the [[United States Mint]] which now operates as a museum, and [[The Historic New Orleans Collection]], a museum and research center housing art and artifacts relating to the [[history of New Orleans|history]] and the [[Gulf South]].

Close to the Quarter is the [[Tremé]] community, which contains the [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]] and the [[New Orleans African American Museum]]—a site which is listed on the [[Louisiana African American Heritage Trail]].

The ''[[Natchez (boat)|Natchez]]'' is an authentic [[steamboat]] with a [[Calliope (music)|calliope]] that cruises the length of the city twice daily. Unlike most other places in the United States, New Orleans has become widely known for its [[elegant decay]]. The city's [[Historic Cemeteries of New Orleans|historic cemeteries]] and their distinct above-ground [[tomb]]s are attractions in themselves, the oldest and most famous of which, [[Saint Louis Cemetery]], greatly resembles [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

The New Orleans area is home to numerous annual celebrations. The most well known is [[Carnival]], or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]. Carnival officially begins on the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]], also known in some Christian traditions as the "[[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]" of Christmas. ''Mardi Gras'' (French for "Fat Tuesday"), the final and grandest day of traditional Catholic festivities, is the last Tuesday before the [[Christianity|Christian]] liturgical season of [[Lent]], which commences on [[Ash Wednesday]].

The largest of the city's many music festivals is the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]]. Commonly referred to simply as "Jazz Fest", it is one of the nation's largest music festivals. The festival features a variety of music, including both native Louisiana and international artists. Along with Jazz Fest, New Orleans' [[Voodoo Experience]] ("Voodoo Fest") and the [[Essence Music Festival]] also feature local and international artists.

Other major festivals include [[Southern Decadence]], the French Quarter Festival, and the [[Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival]]. The American playwright lived and wrote in New Orleans early in his career, and set his play, ''[[Streetcar Named Desire]],'' there.

In 2002, Louisiana began offering tax incentives for film and television production. This has resulted in a substantial increase in activity and brought the nickname of "Hollywood South" for New Orleans. Films produced in and around the city include ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'', ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'', ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]'', ''[[Deja Vu (2006 film)|Déjà Vu]]'', ''[[Last Holiday (2006 film)|Last Holiday]]'', ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'', and ''[[Project Power]]''.

In the nineteenth century, the city was the home of two of America's most important venues for [[French opera]], the [[Théâtre d'Orléans]] and later the [[French Opera House]]. Today, opera is performed by the [[New Orleans Opera]]. The [[Marigny Opera House]] is home to the Marigny Opera Ballet and also hosts opera, jazz, and classical music performances.

New Orleans has long been a significant center for music, showcasing its intertwined European, African and Latino American cultures. The city's unique musical heritage was born in its colonial and early American days from a unique blending of European musical instruments with African rhythms. As the only North American city to have allowed [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] to gather in public and play their native music (largely in [[Congo Square]], now located within [[Louis Armstrong Park (New Orleans)|Louis Armstrong Park]]), New Orleans gave birth in the early 20th century to an epochal indigenous music: [[jazz]]. Soon, African American [[brass band]]s formed, beginning a century-long tradition. The Louis Armstrong Park area, near the French Quarter in [[Tremé]], contains the [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]]. The city's music was later also significantly influenced by [[Acadiana]], home of [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] music, and by [[blues|Delta blues]].

New Orleans' unique musical culture is on display in its traditional funerals. A spin on military funerals, New Orleans' traditional funerals feature sad music (mostly [[dirge]]s and [[hymn]]s) in processions on the way to the cemetery and happier music (hot jazz) on the way back. Until the 1990s, most locals preferred to call these "funerals with music". Visitors to the city have long dubbed them "[[jazz funeral]]s".

Much later in its musical development, New Orleans was home to a distinctive brand of [[rhythm and blues]] that contributed greatly to the growth of [[rock and roll]]. An example of the New Orleans' sound in the 1960s is the No. 1 U.S. hit "[[Chapel of Love]]" by [[the Dixie Cups]], a song which knocked [[the Beatles]] out of the top spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. New Orleans became a hotbed for [[funk]] music in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the late 1980s, it had developed its own localized variant of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], called [[bounce music]]. While not commercially successful outside of the [[Deep South]], bounce music was immensely popular in poorer neighborhoods throughout the 1990s.

A cousin of bounce, [[southern hip hop|New Orleans hip hop]] achieved commercial success locally and internationally, producing [[Lil Wayne]], [[Master P]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[Suicideboys]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[No Limit Records]]. Additionally, the popularity of [[cowpunk]], a fast form of [[southern rock]], originated with the help of several local bands, such as [[The Radiators (US)|The Radiators]], [[Better Than Ezra]], [[Cowboy Mouth]] and [[Dash Rip Rock]]. Throughout the 1990s, many [[sludge metal]] bands started.

{{Main|Cuisine of New Orleans|Louisiana Creole cuisine|Cajun cuisine}}
New Orleans is world-famous for its cuisine. The indigenous cuisine is distinctive and influential. New Orleans food combined local Creole, haute Creole and New Orleans French cuisines. Local ingredients, French, Spanish, Italian, African, Native American, Cajun, Chinese, and a hint of Cuban traditions combine to produce a truly unique and easily recognizable New Orleans flavor.

New Orleans is known for specialties including [[beignet]]s (locally pronounced like "ben-yays"), square-shaped fried dough that could be called "French doughnuts" (served with ''[[café au lait]]'' made with a blend of coffee and chicory rather than only coffee); and [[po' boy]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.neworleans.com/restaurants/traditional-new-orleans-foods/po-boys/ |title=New Orleans Po-Boy |website=www.neworleans.com |access-date=June 30, 2019 |archive-date=June 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630222519/https://www.neworleans.com/restaurants/traditional-new-orleans-foods/po-boys/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and Italian [[muffuletta]] sandwiches; Gulf oysters on the half-shell, fried oysters, boiled [[crayfish|crawfish]] and other [[seafood]]; [[étouffée]], [[jambalaya]], [[gumbo]] and other Creole dishes; and the Monday favorite of [[red beans and rice]] ([[Louis Armstrong]] often signed his letters, "Red beans and ricely yours"). Another New Orleans specialty is the [[pralin]]e {{IPAc-en|local|ˈ|p|r|ɑː|l|iː|n}}, a candy made with brown sugar, granulated sugar, cream, butter, and pecans. The city offers notable street food<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nyfjournal.com/2012/03/new-orleans-street-foods-snacks-sandwiches-po-boys-oysters-muffulettas-beignets-pralines/ |title=New Orleans Street Foods, Snacks, & Sandwiches: Po' Boys, Oysters, Muffulettas, Beignets, Pralines |date=March 16, 2012 |website=New York Food Journal |access-date=June 30, 2019 |archive-date=June 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630222518/http://www.nyfjournal.com/2012/03/new-orleans-street-foods-snacks-sandwiches-po-boys-oysters-muffulettas-beignets-pralines/ |url-status=live }}</ref> including the Asian inspired beef [[Yaka mein]].

===Dialect===
{{main|New Orleans English}}
{{see also|Culture of New Orleans#Language}}[[File:Cafe du Monde New Orleans.jpg|thumb|[[Café du Monde]], a landmark New Orleans beignet cafe established in 1862]]New Orleans developed a distinctive local dialect that is neither [[Cajun English]] nor the stereotypical [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] that is often misportrayed by film and television actors. Like earlier Southern Englishes, it features frequent [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|deletion of the pre-consonantal "r"]], though the local white dialect also came to be quite similar to [[New York accent]]s.<ref>Liebling, A. J. (1970). ''The Earl of Louisiana''. Baton Rouge: LSU.</ref> No consensus describes how this happened, but it likely resulted from New Orleans' geographic isolation by water and the fact that the city was a major immigration port throughout the 19th century and early 20th century. Specifically, many members of European immigrant families originally raised in the cities of the Northeast, namely New York, moved to New Orleans during this time frame, bringing their Northeastern accents along with their [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] (especially [[Sicilian American|Sicilian]]), [[German American|German]], and [[Jewish American|Jewish]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388 |title=Newcomers' Incentive Extension |publisher=Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans |access-date=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524200300/http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388 |archive-date=May 24, 2008}}</ref>

One of the strongest varieties of the New Orleans accent is sometimes identified as the [[Yat dialect]], from the greeting "Where y'at?" This distinctive accent is dying out in the city, but remains strong in the surrounding parishes.

Less visibly, various ethnic groups throughout the area have retained distinct language traditions. Since Louisiana became the first U.S. state to join the {{Lang|fr|[[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]]}} in 2018, New Orleans has reemerged as an important center for the state's francophone and creolophone cultures and languages, as seen in new organizations such as the Nous Foundation.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hasselle |first=Della |date=October 13, 2018 |title=Louisiana Joins International Organization of French-speaking Governments |language=en |work=NOLA.com |url=https://www.nola.com/news/article_302082ef-9b0e-59de-8583-4e320c5c792a.html |access-date=February 2, 2022 |archive-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726110030/https://www.nola.com/news/article_302082ef-9b0e-59de-8583-4e320c5c792a.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Although rare, [[Louisiana French]] and [[Louisiana Creole]] are still spoken in the city. There is also Louisiana-Canarian Spanish dialect, the [[Isleño Spanish]], spoken by the [[Isleño]] people and older members of the population.

The city of New Orleans is a political subdivision of the U.S. state of Louisiana. The city and the [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]] of Orleans operate as a merged [[Consolidated city–county|city-parish government]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |archive-date=May 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty. |url-status=live }}</ref> The original city was composed of what are now the 1st through 9th wards. The city of [[Faubourg Lafayette|Lafayette]] (including the Garden District) was added in 1852 as the 10th and 11th wards. In 1870, Jefferson City, including Faubourg Bouligny and much of the Audubon and University areas, was annexed as the 12th, 13th, and 14th wards. [[Algiers, New Orleans|Algiers]], on the west bank of the Mississippi, was also annexed in 1870, becoming the 15th ward.

New Orleans has a [[mayor-council government]], following a [[home rule]] charter adopted in 1954, as later amended. The [[city council]] consists of seven members, five elected from [[single-member districts]] and two members elected [[at-large]], that is, across the city-parish. [[LaToya Cantrell]] assumed the mayor's office in 2018 as the first female mayor of the city. An ordinance in 2006 established an [[New Orleans Office of Inspector General|Office of Inspector General]] to review city government activities.

New Orleans' government is largely centralized in the city council and mayor's office, but it maintains earlier systems from when various sections of the city managed their affairs separately. For example, New Orleans had seven elected tax assessors, each with their own staff, representing various districts of the city, rather than one centralized office. A constitutional amendment passed on November 7, 2006, consolidated the seven assessors into one in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/02/erroll_williams_elected_citywi.html |title=Erroll Williams Elected CityWide Tax Assessor |publisher=he Times-Picayune |access-date=July 6, 2010 |archive-date=February 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222073129/http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/02/erroll_williams_elected_citywi.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Orleans Parish School Board]] (OPSB), also known as New Orleans Public Schools (NOPS), is the public school district for the entire city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st22_la/schooldistrict_maps/c22071_orleans/DC20SD_C22071.pdf |title=2020 CENSUS - SCHOOL DISTRICT REFERENCE MAP: Orleans Parish, LA |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |access-date=2022-07-25 |archive-date=July 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220725050548/https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st22_la/schooldistrict_maps/c22071_orleans/DC20SD_C22071.pdf |url-status=live }} - [https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st22_la/schooldistrict_maps/c22071_orleans/DC20SD_C22071_SD2MS.txt Text list] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220725050548/https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st22_la/schooldistrict_maps/c22071_orleans/DC20SD_C22071_SD2MS.txt |date=July 25, 2022 }}</ref> Katrina was a watershed moment for the school system. Pre-Katrina, NOPS was one of the area's largest systems (along with the [[Jefferson Parish Public Schools|Jefferson Parish public school system]]). It was also the lowest-performing school district in Louisiana. According to researchers [[Carl L. Bankston]] and Stephen J. Caldas, only 12 of the 103 public schools within the city limits showed reasonably good performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbiltuniversitypress.com/bookdetail.asp?book_id=3850 |title=A Troubled Dream: The Promise and Failure of School Desegregation in Louisiana |first=Carl L. |last=Bankston III |year=2002 |publisher=Vanderbilt University |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226063053/https://www.vanderbiltuniversitypress.com/bookdetail.asp?book_id=3850 |archive-date=February 26, 2009}}</ref>

Following Hurricane Katrina, the state of Louisiana took over most of the schools within the system (all schools that matched a nominal "worst-performing" metric). Many of these schools (and others) were subsequently granted operating charters giving them administrative independence from the Orleans Parish School Board, the [[Recovery School District]] or the [[Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education]] (BESE). At the start of the 2014 school year, all public school students in the NOPS system attended these independent [[Charter school|public charter schools]], the nation's first to do so.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harden |first1=Kari Dequine |title=New Orleans nearing a 'privatized' public school system |url=http://www.louisianaweekly.com/new-orleans-nearing-a-privatized-public-school-system/ |access-date=July 1, 2014 |newspaper=Louisiana Weekly |date=June 2, 2014 |ref=LA Weekly June 2, 2014 |quote=As the Recovery School District (RSD) shuts the doors on its remaining handful of traditional public schools, the start of the 2014 school year will usher in the nation's first completely privatized public school district. |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714190754/http://www.louisianaweekly.com/new-orleans-nearing-a-privatized-public-school-system/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The charter schools made significant and sustained gains in student achievement, led by outside operators such as [[Knowledge Is Power Program|KIPP]], the Algiers Charter School Network, and the Capital One–University of New Orleans Charter School Network. An October 2009 assessment demonstrated continued growth in the academic performance of public schools. Considering the scores of all public schools in New Orleans gives an overall school district performance score of 70.6. This score represents a 24% improvement over an equivalent pre-Katrina (2004) metric, when a district score of 56.9 was posted.<ref>"Orleans Parish school performance scores continue to improve", ''The Times-Picayune'', October 14, 2009.</ref> Notably, this score of 70.6 approaches the score (78.4) posted in 2009 by the adjacent, suburban [[Jefferson Parish Public Schools|Jefferson Parish public school system]], though that system's performance score is itself below the state average of 91.<ref>"[https://www.nola.com/opinions/article_0e7bdeae-1333-5c49-b9b8-f925b050a83c.html Jefferson Parish schools make progress, but still have long way to go: an editorial] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804104650/https://www.nola.com/opinions/article_0e7bdeae-1333-5c49-b9b8-f925b050a83c.html |date=August 4, 2020 }}", ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'', October 15, 2009.</ref>

Historically, the major newspaper in the area was ''The Times-Picayune''. The paper made headlines of its own in 2012 when owner [[Advance Publications]] cut its print schedule to three days each week, instead focusing its efforts on its website, NOLA.com. That action briefly made New Orleans the largest city in the country without a daily newspaper, until the [[Baton Rouge]] newspaper ''[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]'' began a New Orleans edition in September 2012. In June 2013, the ''Times-Picayune'' resumed daily printing with a condensed [[newsstand]] [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] edition, nicknamed ''TP Street'', which is published on the three days each week that its namesake [[broadsheet]] edition is not printed (the Picayune has not returned to daily delivery). With the resumption of daily print editions from the ''Times-Picayune'' and the launch of the New Orleans edition of ''The Advocate'', now ''The New Orleans Advocate'', the city had two daily newspapers for the first time since the afternoon ''States-Item'' ceased publication on May 31, 1980. In 2019, the papers merged to form ''[[The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate]]''.

In addition to the daily newspaper, weekly publications include ''[[The Louisiana Weekly]]'' and ''[[Gambit Weekly]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/ |title=New Orleans News and Entertainment |website=Gambit Weekly |access-date=September 3, 2005 |archive-date=September 5, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905124246/http://www.bestofneworleans.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Also in wide circulation is the ''[[Clarion Herald]]'', the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans.

==Transportation==

===Public transportation===
Hurricane Katrina devastated transit service in 2005. The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA) was quicker to restore the streetcars to service, while bus service had only been restored to 35% of pre-Katrina levels as recently as the end of 2013. During the same period, streetcars arrived at an average of once every seventeen minutes, compared to bus frequencies of once every thirty-eight minutes. The same priority was demonstrated in RTA's spending, increasing the proportion of its budget devoted to streetcars to more than three times compared to its pre-Katrina budget.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jaffe, Eric |title=A Troubling Review of Public Transit in New Orleans Since Katrina |newspaper=Bloomberg.com |date=August 17, 2015 |access-date=May 19, 2018 |publisher=City Lab |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/08/a-scathing-review-of-public-transit-in-new-orleans-since-katrina/401423/ |archive-date=May 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520054751/https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/08/a-scathing-review-of-public-transit-in-new-orleans-since-katrina/401423/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Through the end of 2017, counting both streetcar and bus trips, only 51% of service had been restored to pre-Katrina levels.<ref name=ridenola>{{cite news |title=The State of Transit 2017: Creating our Transit Future |publisher=Ride New Orleans}}</ref>

In 2017, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority began operation on the extension of the Rampart{{endash}}St. Claude streetcar line. Another change to transit service that year was the re-routing of the 15 Freret and 28 Martin Luther King bus routes to Canal Street. These increased the number of jobs accessible by a thirty-minute walk or transit ride: from 83,722 in 2016 to 89,216 in 2017. This resulted in a regional increase in such job access by more than a full percentage point.<ref name=ridenola/>

{{Main|Streetcars in New Orleans}}
New Orleans has four active [[Tram|streetcar lines]]:
* The [[St. Charles Streetcar Line]] is the oldest continuously operating streetcar line in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2018/11/st-charles-avenues-streetcar/ |title=St. Charles Avenue's Streetcar {{!}} Inside Adams: Science, Technology & Business |last=Terrell |first=Ellen |date=November 28, 2018 |website=blogs.loc.gov |access-date=November 13, 2019 |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113194151/https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2018/11/st-charles-avenues-streetcar/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The line first operated as local rail service in 1835 between Carrollton and downtown New Orleans. Operated by the Carrollton & New Orleans R.R. Co., the locomotives were then powered by steam engines, and a one-way fare cost 25 cents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Streetcars of New Orleans |author=Hennick, Louis C. and Elbridge Harper Charlton |year=2005 |publisher=Jackson Square Press |page=14 |location=Gretna, LA |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2Zu8CSRFZAC |isbn=978-1455612598 |access-date=October 19, 2020 |archive-date=January 10, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240110085309/https://books.google.com/books?id=X2Zu8CSRFZAC |url-status=live }}</ref> Each car is a historic landmark. It runs from Canal Street to the other end of St. Charles Avenue, then turns right into South Carrollton Avenue to its terminal at Carrollton and Claiborne.
* The [[Riverfront Streetcar Line]] runs parallel to the river from Esplanade Street through the French Quarter to Canal Street to the Convention Center above Julia Street in the Arts District.
* The [[Canal Streetcar Line]] uses the Riverfront line tracks from the intersection of Canal Street and Poydras Street, down Canal Street, then branches off and ends at the cemeteries at City Park Avenue, with a spur running from the intersection of Canal and Carrollton Avenue to the entrance of City Park at Esplanade, near the entrance to the New Orleans Museum of Art.
* The [[Rampart–St. Claude Streetcar Line]] opened on January 28, 2013, as the ''Loyola-UPT Line'' running along Loyola Avenue from [[New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal]] to Canal Street, then continuing along Canal Street to the river, and on weekends on the Riverfront line tracks to French Market. The French Quarter Rail Expansion extended the line from the Loyola Avenue/Canal Street intersection along Rampart Street and St. Claude Avenue to Elysian Fields Avenue. It no longer runs along Canal Street to the river, or on weekends on the Riverfront line tracks to French Market.

The city's streetcars were featured in the [[Tennessee Williams]] play ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. The streetcar line to Desire Street became a bus line in 1948.

====Buses====
[[Public transport]]ation is operated by the [[New Orleans Regional Transit Authority]] ("RTA"). Many [[bus]] routes connect the city and suburban areas. The RTA lost 200+ buses in the flood. Some of the replacement buses operate on [[biodiesel]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Powell |first1=Allen |title=New Jefferson Transit buses run on biodiesel |url=https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_9eef3085-9930-5d71-b28f-752dcfc47696.html |access-date=March 2, 2022 |work=The Times-Picayune |date=June 23, 2010 |language=en |archive-date=March 2, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302091933/https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_9eef3085-9930-5d71-b28f-752dcfc47696.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] Department of Transit Administration<ref>[http://www.jeffparish.net/index.cfm?DocID=1196 Department of Transit Administration.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220045454/http://www.jeffparish.net/index.cfm?DocID=1196 |date=February 20, 2012 }} The Parish of Jefferson.

The [[Canal Street Ferry]] (or Algiers Ferry) connects downtown New Orleans at the foot of [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] with the [[National Historic Landmark District]] of [[Algiers Point]] across the Mississippi ("West Bank" in local parlance). It services passenger vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. This same terminal also serves the Canal Street/Gretna Ferry, connecting [[Gretna, Louisiana]] for pedestrians and bicyclists only. A third auto/bicycle/pedestrian connects [[Chalmette, Louisiana]] and Lower Algiers.<ref name=friendsoftheferry.org>{{cite web |title=Friends of the Ferry |url=http://www.friendsoftheferry.org/ |access-date=July 2, 2014 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131434/http://www.friendsoftheferry.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Bicycling===
The city's flat landscape, simple street grid and mild winters facilitate [[bicycle]] ridership, helping to make New Orleans eighth among U.S. cities in its rate of bicycle and [[pedestrian]] transportation as of 2010,<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/article_40a94334-eaa5-512d-8f6a-de89a3bb52f0.html |title=Bicycle Second Line celebrates New Orleans' expanded bike lanes and awareness |author=Molly Reid |website=NOLA.com |date=May 21, 2010 |access-date=January 1, 2021 |archive-date=February 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225094816/https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/article_40a94334-eaa5-512d-8f6a-de89a3bb52f0.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and sixth in terms of the percentage of bicycling commuters.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/ |title=Politics &#124; News from The Advocate |first=The |last=Advocate |website=The Advocate |date=May 21, 2023 |access-date=January 1, 2021 |archive-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107142741/https://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/troy_brown_resigns_louisiana_s.html |url-status=live }}</ref> New Orleans is located at the start of the [[Mississippi River Trail]], a {{convert|3000|mi|km|adj=on}} bicycle path that stretches from the city's [[Audubon Park, New Orleans|Audubon Park]] to [[Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mississippirivertrail.org/map.html |title=Welcome Mississippi River Trail |website=www.mississippirivertrail.org |access-date=December 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181208065602/http://www.mississippirivertrail.org/map.html |archive-date=December 8, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Since Katrina the city has actively sought to promote bicycling by constructing a $1.5&nbsp;million bike trail from [[Mid-City New Orleans|Mid-City]] to [[Lake Pontchartrain]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/10/wisner_bike_path_opens_today.html|title=Wisner bike path opens today}}</ref> and by adding over {{convert|37|mi|km}} of [[bicycle lane]]s to various streets, including [[St. Charles Avenue]].<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In 2009, [[Tulane University]] contributed to these efforts by converting the main street through its [[Uptown New Orleans|Uptown]] campus, [[McAlister Place, New Orleans|McAlister Place]], into a [[pedestrian mall]] open to bicycle traffic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/oua/mcalister-place.cfm |title=McAlister Place |website=tulane.edu |access-date=August 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820085913/http://tulane.edu/oua/mcalister-place.cfm |archive-date=August 20, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Lafitte Greenway]] bicycle and pedestrian trail opened in 2015, and is ultimately planned to extend {{convert|3.1|mi|adj=on}} from the French Quarter to Lakeview.

===Roads===
{{See also|List of streets of New Orleans}}
New Orleans is served by [[Interstate 10]], <!--[[Interstate 49]],--> [[Interstate 610 (Louisiana)|Interstate 610]] and [[Interstate 510]]. I-10 travels east–west through the city as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]]. In [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] it is known as the Eastern Expressway. I-610 provides a direct shortcut for traffic passing through New Orleans via I-10, allowing that traffic to bypass I-10's southward curve.

In addition to the interstates, [[U.S. Route 90|U.S. 90]] travels through the city, while [[U.S. Route 61|U.S. 61]] terminates downtown. In addition, [[U.S. Route 11|U.S. 11]] terminates in the eastern portion of the city.

New Orleans is home to many bridges; [[Crescent City Connection]] is perhaps the most notable. It serves as New Orleans' major bridge across the Mississippi, providing a connection between the city's downtown on the eastbank and its westbank suburbs. Other Mississippi crossings are the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], carrying U.S. 90 and the [[Luling Bridge|Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge]], carrying [[Interstate 310 (Louisiana)|Interstate 310]].

The [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Twin Span Bridge]], a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) [[causeway]] in eastern New Orleans, carries I-10 across Lake Pontchartrain. Also in eastern New Orleans, [[Interstate 510]]/[[Louisiana Highway 47|LA 47]] travels across the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]/[[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] via the [[Green Bridge (New Orleans)|Paris Road Bridge]], connecting [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] and suburban [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]].

The tolled [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]], consisting of two parallel bridges are, at {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} long, the longest bridges in the world. Built in the 1950s (southbound span) and 1960s (northbound span), the bridges connect New Orleans with its suburbs on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain via [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].

===Taxi service===
United Cab is the city's largest taxi service, with a fleet of over 300 cabs.<ref name="4WWL">{{cite news |last1=Farris |first1=Meg |title=BREAKING LIVE VIDEO LIVE @ 11:30 AM: Update on Canal St mass shooting from NOPD LOCAL Cab companies: City regulations will force us to close |url=https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/cab-companies-city-regulations-will-force-us-to-close/289-593532684 |access-date=December 2, 2019 |work=4WWL TV |date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> It has operated 365 days a year since its establishment in 1938, with the exception of the month after [[Hurricane Katrina]], in which operations were temporarily shut down due to disruptions in radio service.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Robert |date=March 10, 2016 |title=Danae Columbus: United Cab says business down 50 percent since arrival of Uber, and now Lyft |url=http://uptownmessenger.com/2016/03/danae-columbus-united-cab-says-business-down-50-percent-since-arrival-of-uber-and-now-lyft/ |newspaper=Uptown Messenger |access-date=April 21, 2016 |archive-date=November 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191125092246/http://uptownmessenger.com/2016/03/danae-columbus-united-cab-says-business-down-50-percent-since-arrival-of-uber-and-now-lyft/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

United Cab's fleet was once larger than 450 cabs, but has been reduced in recent years due to competition from services like [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]], according to owner Syed Kazmi.<ref name="4WWL"/> In January 2016, New Orleans-based sweet shop Sucré approached United Cab with to deliver its [[king cake]]s locally on-demand. Sucré saw this partnership as a way to alleviate some of the financial pressure being placed on taxi services due to Uber's presence in the city.<ref>{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Richard |date=January 15, 2016 |title=King cake maker, cab company team up on deliveries in Uber era |url=http://theadvocate.com/news/neworleans/14585605-148/king-cake-maker-cab-company-team-up-on-deliveries-in-uber-era |newspaper=The Advocate |access-date=April 21, 2016 |archive-date=April 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424224316/http://theadvocate.com/news/neworleans/14585605-148/king-cake-maker-cab-company-team-up-on-deliveries-in-uber-era |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Airports===
The metropolitan area is served by the [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]], located in the suburb of [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]]. Regional airports include the [[New Orleans Lakefront Airport|Lakefront Airport]], [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans]] (Callender Field) in the suburb of Belle Chasse and [[Southern Seaplane Airport]], also located in Belle Chasse. Southern Seaplane has a {{convert|3200|ft|m|-1|adj=on}} runway for wheeled planes and a {{convert|5000|ft|m|-2|adj=on}} water runway for seaplanes.

Armstrong International is the busiest airport in Louisiana and the only to handle scheduled international passenger flights. As of 2018, more than 13&nbsp;million passengers passed through Armstrong, on nonstops flights from more than 57 destinations, including foreign nonstops from the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

===Rail===
The city is served by [[Amtrak]]. The [[New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal]] is the central rail depot and is served by the ''[[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent]]'', operating between New Orleans and New York City; the ''[[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]]'', operating between New Orleans and Chicago and the ''[[Sunset Limited]]'', operating between New Orleans and Los Angeles. Up until August 2005 (when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck), the ''Sunset Limited's'' route continued east to Orlando.

With the strategic benefits of both the port and its double-track Mississippi River crossings, the city attracted all six of the [[Class I railroad]]s in North America: [[Union Pacific Railroad]], [[BNSF Railway]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[Canadian Pacific Kansas City]], [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Canadian National Railway]]. The [[New Orleans Public Belt Railroad]] provides interchange services between the railroads.
