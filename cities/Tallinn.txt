== Names and etymology<span class="anchor" id="Names of Tallinn"></span><span class="anchor" id="Etymology of Tallinn"></span> ==
{{see also|Names of Tallinn in different languages}}
The name Tallinn(a) is [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. It has been widely considered a historical derivation of ''Taani-linna'',{{efn|The [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] element ''-linna'', like [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] ''-[[wikt:burg|burg]]'' and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''-[[grad (geography)|grad]]'' /''-gorod'', originally meant "fortress", but has been used as a suffix in the formation of town names. The [[Estonian language|Estonian]] word ''linn'' nowadays means "town" or "city".}} meaning "Danish-castle"{{efn|The Danish heritage is also evident in the city's lesser coat of arms, depicting the [[flag of Denmark]] (''Dannebrog'').}} ({{langx|la|[[Castrum Danorum]]}}), conceivably because the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] invaders built the castle in place of the Estonian stronghold after the 1219 battle of Lyndanisse.<!--However, according to minor theories, it could also have come from ''tali-linna'' (winter-castle or town), or ''talu-linna'' (house/farmstead-castle or town).{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}-->

The Icelandic ''[[Njal's saga]]''—composed after 1270, but describing events between 960 and 1020—mentions an event that occurred somewhere in the area of Tallinn and calls the place ''Rafala'' (probably a derivation of ''[[Revala|Rävala]]'', ''Revala'', or some other variant of the Estonian name of the adjacent [[Ancient Estonia|medieval Estonian county]]). Soon after the Danish conquest in 1219, the town became known in the [[Scandinavia]]n and [[German language|German]] languages as '''Reval''' ({{langx|la|Revalia}}). ''Reval'' was in official use in Estonia until 1918.

In international use, the English and German-language ({{Audio|Reval.ogg|''Reval''}}; {{IPA|de|ˈʁeːval|lang|De-Reval.ogg}}) as well as the Russian analog ''Revel'' ({{lang|ru|Ревель}}) were all gradually replaced by the Estonian name after the country became independent in 1918. At first, both Estonian forms, ''Tallinna'' and ''Tallinn'', were used.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tallinn in Your Pocket |last=Singer |first=Nat A. |author2=Steve Roman |year=2008 |publisher=In Your Pocket |isbn=978-0-01-406269-0 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZdt1EnuafsC&pg=PA13 }}</ref> ''Tallinna'' in Estonian denotes also the [[genitive case]] of the name, as in ''Tallinna Sadam'' ('the [[Port of Tallinn]]').

As an important port on a major trade route between [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and western Europe, it became a target for the expansion of the [[Teutonic Knights]] and the Kingdom of Denmark during the period of [[Northern Crusades]] in the beginning of the 13th century when [[Roman Catholic Church|Christianity]] was forcibly imposed on the local population. Danish rule of Tallinn and northern Estonia started in 1219.

In 1285, Tallinn, then known more widely as Reval, became the northernmost member of the [[Hanseatic League]]&nbsp;– a mercantile and military alliance of German-dominated cities in Northern Europe. The king of Denmark sold Reval along with other land possessions in northern Estonia to the Teutonic Knights in 1346. Reval was arguably the most significant [[Middle Ages|medieval]] port in the Gulf of Finland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/fi/article/20110110STO11392/turku-ja-tallinna-euroopan-kulttuuripaakaupungit-2011|title=Turku ja Tallinna – Euroopan kulttuuripääkaupungit 2011|date=1 October 2011|website=Aiheet &#124; Euroopan parlamentti|access-date=16 May 2024|archive-date=16 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240516161418/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/fi/article/20110110STO11392/turku-ja-tallinna-euroopan-kulttuuripaakaupungit-2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Reval enjoyed a strategic position at the crossroads of trade between the rest of western Europe and [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]] in the east. The city, with a population of about 8,000, was very well fortified with [[Tallinn City Walls|city walls and 66 defence towers]]. The city wall has been described as an outstanding example of German Medieval fortification architecture.<ref>{{cite book|series=Studien zum Deutschtum im Osten|volume=6|title=Der Ostseeraum im Blickfeld der Deutschen Geschichte|publisher=Böhlau Verlag|author=Günther Grundmann|chapter=Die mittelalterliche Stadtbaukunst|pages=83}}</ref>

A [[weather vane]], the figure of an old warrior called [[Old Thomas]], was put on top of the spire of the [[Tallinn Town Hall]] in 1530. Old Thomas later became a popular symbol of the city.
[[File:Reval im Jahre 1650.png|600px|left|City skyline of Tallinn (Reval) and the harbour in 1650]]
In the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation]], the city converted to [[Lutheranism]]. In 1561, Reval (Tallinn) became a [[Dominions of Sweden|dominion]] of Sweden.

During the 1700–1721 [[Great Northern War]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]]-[[The plague during the Great Northern War#Lithuania, Livonia, Estonia|stricken]] Tallinn along with Swedish Estonia and Livonia [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|capitulated]] to [[Tsardom of Russia]] (Muscovy) in 1710, but the local self-government institutions ([[Magistracy]] of Reval and [[Estonian Knighthood]]) retained their cultural and economical autonomy within Imperial Russia as the [[Governorate of Estonia]]. The Magistracy of Reval was abolished in 1889. The 19th century brought industrialisation of the city and the port kept its importance. 

On 24 February 1918, the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was proclaimed in Tallinn. It was followed by [[German Empire|Imperial German]] [[German occupation of Estonia during World War I|occupation]] until the end of [[World War I]] in November 1918, after which Tallinn became the capital of independent Estonia. During [[Estonia in World War II|World War II]], Estonia was first [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied]] by the Soviet army and annexed into the USSR in the summer of 1940, then [[German occupation of the Baltic states during World War II|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1941 to 1944.<!-- See History of Estonia, German Occupation of Estonia -- When German forces invaded there were about 1,000 remaining Jews in the city of Tallinn, nearly all of whom would die in the [[Holocaust]] at the hands of the Nazis before the war's end.<ref name="bh.org.il">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Tallinn |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/tallinn |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |access-date=26 June 2018}}</ref> --> During the German occupation Tallinn suffered from many instances of [[Aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombing]] by the [[Long-Range Aviation|Soviet air force]].

After the German retreat in September 1944, the city was [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied again by the Soviet Union]].

During the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|sailing (then known as yachting)]] events were held at [[Pirita (subdistrict)|Pirita]], north-east of central Tallinn. Many buildings, such as the [[Tallinn TV Tower]], "Olümpia" hotel, the new Main Post Office building, and the Regatta Centre, were built for the Olympics.

In 1991, the independent democratic Estonian nation was restored and a period of quick development as a modern European capital ensued. Tallinn became the capital of a ''de facto'' independent country once again on 20 August 1991. The Old Town became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997,<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic Centre (Old Town) of Tallinn |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/822/#:~:text=The%20Historic%20Centre%20(Old%20Town,coast%20of%20the%20Baltic%20Sea. |website=UNESCO |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=11 March 2022 |archive-date=11 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220311015917/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/822/#:~:text=The%20Historic%20Centre%20(Old%20Town,coast%20of%20the%20Baltic%20Sea. |url-status=live }}</ref> and the city hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002 Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tallinn 2002 |url=https://eurovision.tv/event/tallinn-2002 |website=Eurovision Song Contest |publisher=European Broadcasting Union |access-date=11 March 2022 |archive-date=27 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327123624/https://eurovision.tv/event/tallinn-2002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tallinn was the 2011 [[European Capital of Culture]], and is the recipient of the 2023 [[European Green Capital|European Green Capital Award]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nikel |first1=David |title=Introducing Estonia's Tallinn, European Green Capital 2023 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2021/09/11/introducing-estonias-tallinn-european-green-capital-2023/?sh=467d6b7c735d |access-date=11 March 2022 |agency=Forbes |publisher=Integrated Whale Media Investments |date=September 11, 2021 |archive-date=11 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220311015917/https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2021/09/11/introducing-estonias-tallinn-european-green-capital-2023/?sh=467d6b7c735d |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and takes pride in its biodiversity and high air quality.<ref name=":55">{{Cite book |last=Bank |first=European Investment |url=https://www.eib.org/en/publications/sustainability-report-2021 |title=EIB Group Sustainability Report 2021 |date=2022-07-06 |publisher=European Investment Bank |isbn=978-92-861-5237-5 |language=EN |access-date=26 July 2022 |archive-date=16 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230716182307/https://www.eib.org/en/publications/sustainability-report-2021 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Saarniit |first=Helen |title=How can Estonia's transport and housing sectors contribute to cleaner air and a safer climate? |url=https://www.sei.org/featured/how-can-estonias-transport-and-housing-sectors-contribute-to-cleaner-air-and-a-safer-climate/ |access-date=2022-07-26 |website=SEI}}</ref> But critics say that the award was received on false promises since it won the title with its "[[15-minute city]]" concept, according to which key facilities and services should be accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride but the concept was left out of the green capital program and other parts of the 12 million euro program amount to a collection of temporary and one-off projects without any structural and lasting changes.<ref name="Pärli 2023">{{cite web | last=Pärli | first=Merilin | title=Critics: Tallinn's green capital program doesn't offer permanent changes | website=ERR | date=24 January 2023 | url=https://news.err.ee/1608861140/critics-tallinn-s-green-capital-program-doesn-t-offer-permanent-changes | access-date=13 February 2023 | archive-date=7 February 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230207082336/https://news.err.ee/1608861140/critics-tallinn-s-green-capital-program-doesn-t-offer-permanent-changes | url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Härjapea jõgi, 1889.jpg|thumb|[[Härjapea]] river, 1889]]
Tallinn is situated on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], in north-western Estonia.

The largest lake in Tallinn is [[Lake Ülemiste]] ({{convert|9.44|km²|1|abbr=on}}), which serves as the main source of the city's drinking water. [[Lake Harku]] is the second-largest lake within the borders of Tallinn and its area is {{convert|1.6|km²|1|abbr=on}}. The only significant river in Tallinn nowadays is the [[Pirita River|Pirita]] river, in the eponymous [[Pirita]] city district. Historically, a smaller river, called [[Härjapea]], flowed from Lake Ülemiste through the town into the sea, but the river was diverted into underground sewerage system in the 1930s and has since completely disappeared from the cityscape. References to it still remain in the street names Jõe (from ''jõgi'', river) and Kivisilla (from ''kivi sild'', stone bridge).

The length of the seaside coast is {{convert|46|km|0|abbr=on}}, comprising three larger ([[Kopli]], [[Paljassaare]], and [[Kakumäe]]) [[peninsula]]s. The city has a number of public beaches, including those at Pirita, Stroomi, Kakumäe, Harku, and Pikakari.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tallinn Annual Report 2011|page=41|publisher=Tallinn City Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERLDff-KDpIC}}</ref>

The highest point in Tallinn, at 64 m (about 200&nbsp;ft) above sea level, is situated in [[Hiiu]], [[Nõmme]] District, in the south-west of the city. A large [[limestone]] cliff runs through the city. It can be seen at Toompea, [[Lasnamäe]], and [[Astangu]]. However, the hill at Toompea is not geologically part of the larger limestone cliff.

The rocks and sediments underneath Tallinn are of different composition and age. Youngest are the [[Quaternary]] deposits. The materials of these deposits are [[till]], [[varve]]d [[clay]], sand, gravel, and pebbles that are of [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial]], marine and lacustrine origin. Some of the Quaternary deposits are valuable as they constitute [[aquifer]]s, or as in the case of gravels and sands, are used as construction materials. The Quaternary deposits are the fill of valleys that are now buried. The [[buried valley]]s of Tallinn are carved into older rock likely by ancient rivers to be later modified by glaciers. While the valley fill is made up of Quaternary sediments the valleys themselves originated from erosion that took place before the Quaternary.<ref name=Vaheretal2010/> The substrate into which the buried valleys were carved is made up of hard [[sedimentary rock]] of [[Ediacaran]], [[Cambrian]] and [[Ordovician]] age. Only the upper layer of Ordovician rocks protrudes from the cover of younger deposits, [[outcrop|cropping out]] in the [[Baltic Klint]] at the coast and at a few places inland. The Ordovician rocks are made up from top to bottom of a thick layer of limestone and [[marlstone]], then a first layer of [[argillite]] followed by first layer of sandstone and siltstone and then another layer of argillite also followed by sandstone and siltstone. In other places of the city, hard sedimentary rock is only to be found beneath Quaternary sediments at depths reaching as much as 120 m below sea level. Underlying the sedimentary rock are the rocks of the [[Fennoscandia]]n Craton including [[gneiss]]es and other [[metamorphic rock]]s with volcanic rock [[protolith]]s and [[rapakivi granite]]s. These rocks are much older than the rest ([[Paleoproterozoic]] age) and do not crop out anywhere in Estonia.<ref name=Vaheretal2010>{{cite journal|author-last=Vaher|author-first=Rein|author-last2=Miindel|author-first2=Avo|author-last3=Raukas|author-first3=Anto|author-link3=Anto Raukas|author-last4=Tavast|author-first4=Elvi|year=2010|title=Ancient buried valleys in the city of Tallinn and adjacent area|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/Estonian_Journal_of_Earth_Sciences/2010/issue_1/earth-2010-1-37-48.pdf|journal=Estonian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=59|issue=1|pages=37–48|doi=10.3176/earth.2010.1.03|doi-access=free|access-date=24 April 2017|archive-date=9 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809070236/http://www.kirj.ee/public/Estonian_Journal_of_Earth_Sciences/2010/issue_1/earth-2010-1-37-48.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to a 2021 study commissioned by the British price comparison site Uswitch.com, Tallinn is the most unpredictable of European capitals in terms of weather conditions, with a total score of 69/100; the high score is mainly due to  the location between a more maritime and a more continental climate and the variation in the duration of sunshine as a consequence of its high latitude.

Tallinn is subdivided into eight administrative ''linnaosa'' (districts). Each district has a ''linnaosa valitsus'' (district government) which is managed by a ''linnaosavanem'' (district elder) who is appointed by the city government. The function of the "district governments", however, is not directly governing, but just limited to providing advice to the city government and the city council on issues related to the administration of respective districts.

The districts are administratively further divided into 84 ''asum'' (subdistricts or "neighbourhoods" with officially defined borders).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tallinn.ee/est/Tallinn-arvudes-2015-2 |title=01.01.2015 |access-date=31 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119212926/http://www.tallinn.ee/est/Tallinn-arvudes-2015-2 |archive-date=19 November 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The population of Tallinn on 1 January 2024 was 457,572.<ref name="stat-pop" /> It is the [[primate city|primate]] and [[List of cities and towns in Estonia|most populous]] city in Estonia, the [[List of cities in the Baltic states by population|3rd most populous]] city in the three [[Baltic States]] (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), as well as the [[List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits|59th most populous]] city in the European Union.

According to [[Eurostat]], in 2004, Tallinn had one of the largest number of non-EU nationals of all EU member states' capital cities. Ethnic Russians are a significant minority in Tallinn, as around a third of the city's residents are first and second generation immigrants from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union; a majority of the Soviet-era immigrants now hold Estonian citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |author=Eurostat |title=Regions: Statistical yearbook 2004 |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities |location=Luxembourg |year=2004 |page=115/135 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-AF-04-001/EN/KS-AF-04-001-EN.PDF |author-link=Eurostat |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529200628/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-AF-04-001/EN/KS-AF-04-001-EN.PDF |archive-date=29 May 2010  }}</ref>

Ethnic Estonians made up over 80% of Tallinn's population before World War II. As of 2022, ethnic Estonians made up over 53% of the population. Tallinn was one of the urban areas with industrial and military significance in northern Estonia that during the period of [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] underwent extensive changes in its ethnic composition due to large influx of immigrants from Russia and other parts of the former USSR. Whole new city districts were built where the main intent of the then Soviet authorities was to accommodate Russian-speaking immigrants: Mustamäe, Väike-Õismäe, Pelguranna, and most notably, Lasnamäe, which in 1980s became, and is to this day, the most populous district of Tallinn.

The official language of Tallinn is Estonian. As of 2011, 50.1% of the city's residents were native speakers of Estonian, whereas 46.7% had Russian as their [[first language]]. While English is the most frequently used foreign language by the residents of Tallinn, there are also a significant number of native speakers of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].<ref name="Tallinn_City_Council">{{cite web |title=Tallinn arvudes / Statistical Yearbook of Tallinn |language=et, en |publisher=Tallinn City Council |date=3 August 2011 |url=http://www.tallinn.ee/est/g2677s56143 |access-date=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521185751/http://www.tallinn.ee/est/g2677s56143 |archive-date=21 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival===
{{Main|Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival}}

Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (Estonian: Pimedate Ööde Filmifestival, or PÖFF), is an annual film festival held since 1997 in Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia. PÖFF is the only festival in the Nordic and Baltic region with a [[FIAPF]] (International Federation of Film Producers Association) accreditation for holding an international competition programme in the Nordic and Baltic region with 14 other non-specialised festivals, such as [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]]. With over 250 feature films screened each year and over 77500 attendances (2014), PÖFF is one of the largest film events of Northern Europe and cultural events in Estonia in the winter season. During its 19th edition in 2015 the festival screened more than 600 films (including 250+ feature-length films from 80 countries), bringing over 900 screenings to an audience of over 80, 000 people as well as over 700 accredited guests and journalists from 50 countries. In 2010 the festival held the [[European Film Awards]] ceremony in Tallinn.

===Cuisine===
{{see also|Estonian cuisine}}
The traditional cuisine of Tallinn reflects culinary traditions of north Estonia, the role of the city as a fishing port, and historical German influences. Numerous cafés have played a major role in a social life of the city since the 19th century, as have bars, especially in the Kesklinn district.

The ''[[marzipan|martsipan]]'' industry in Tallinn has a very long history. The production of ''martsipan'' started in the Middle Ages, almost simultaneously in Tallinn (Reval) and [[Lübeck]], both member cities of the Hanseatic League. In 1695, ''marzipan'' was mentioned as a medicine, under the designation of ''Panis Martius,'' in the price lists of the [[Raeapteek|Tallinn Town Hall Pharmacy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Martsipani ajalugu |url=http://www.kohvikmaiasmokk.ee/martsipanituba/martsipani-ajalugu/ |work=kohvikmaiasmokk.ee |publisher=AS Kalev |language=et |access-date=13 October 2016 |archive-date=13 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013220645/http://www.kohvikmaiasmokk.ee/martsipanituba/martsipani-ajalugu/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The modern era of ''martsipan'' in Tallinn began in 1806, when the Swiss confectioner Lorenz Caviezel set up his confectionery on Pikk Street. In 1864, it was bought and expanded by Georg Stude and now is known as the [[Maiasmokk]] café. In the late 19th century ''martsipan'' figurines made by Tallinn's confectioners were supplied to the Russian imperial family.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gendlin |first1=Vladimir |last2=Shaposhnikov |first2=Vasily |date=19 May 2003 |title=Estonia // SPRATS IN LIQUEUR |url=http://www.kommersant.com/tree.asp?rubric=2&node=21&doc_id=382605 |newspaper=Kommersant |location=Moscow |access-date=13 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013225539/http://www.kommersant.com/tree.asp?rubric=2&node=21&doc_id=382605 |archive-date=13 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Arguably, the most symbolic seafood dish of Tallinn is ''vürtsikilu'' ("spicy sprat") – salted [[European sprat|sprats]] pickled with a distinctive set of spices including [[black pepper]], [[allspice]] and [[cloves]]. The making of traditional ''vürtsikilu'' is thought to have originated from the city's outskirts. In 1826, the merchants of Tallinn exported 40,000 cans of ''vürtsikilu'' to Saint Petersburg.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tarbija24.postimees.ee/v2/1149312/kuidas-vaeste-lesknaiste-toidust-sai-tallinna-suembol |title=Kuidas vaeste lesknaiste toidust sai Tallinna sümbol |department=Tarbija24 |newspaper=Postimees |date=25 February 2013 |access-date=13 October 2016 |language=et |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014060632/http://tarbija24.postimees.ee/v2/1149312/kuidas-vaeste-lesknaiste-toidust-sai-tallinna-suembol |archive-date=14 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A closely associated dish is ''kiluvõileib'' ("sprat-butter-bread") – a traditional [[rye bread]] open sandwich covered with a layer of butter and ''vürtsikilu'' as the topping. Boiled egg slices and culinary herbs are optional extra toppings. Alcoholic beverages produced in the city include beer, vodka, and liqueurs (such as the eponymous [[Vana Tallinn]]). The number of [[Microbrewery#Craft brewery|craft beer breweries]] has expanded sharply in Tallinn over the last decade, entering local and regional markets.

== Tourism ==

What can arguably be considered to be Tallinn's main attractions are located in the Tallinn Old Town (divided into a "lower town" and [[Toompea]] hill) which is easily explored on foot. The eastern parts of the city, notably [[Pirita]] (with [[Pirita Convent]]) and [[Kadriorg]] (with [[Kadriorg Palace]]) districts, are also popular destinations, and the [[Estonian Open Air Museum]] in [[Rocca al Mare]], west of the city, preserves aspects of Estonian rural culture and architecture. The historical wooded suburbs like [[Kalamaja]], [[Pelgulinn]], [[Kassisaba]] and [[Kelmiküla]] and revitalized industrial areas like [[Rotermanni Quarter]], [[Noblessner]] and [[Dvigatel]] are also unique places to visit.

=== Toompea&nbsp;– Upper Town ===
[[File:Toompea loss 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toompea Castle|Toompea castle]] ]]
[[File:Stenbock House.jpg|thumb|[[Stenbock House]] on [[Toompea]] hill is the official seat of the [[Government of Estonia]].]]
{{main|Toompea}}
This area was once an almost separate town, heavily fortified, and has always been the seat of whatever power that has ruled Estonia. The hill occupies an easily defensible site overlooking the surrounding districts. The major attractions are the medieval [[Toompea Castle]] (today housing the Estonian Parliament, the ''[[Riigikogu]]''), the Lutheran [[St Mary's Cathedral, Tallinn|St Mary's Cathedral]], also known as the Dome Church ({{langx|et|Toomkirik}}), and the Russian Orthodox [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Tallinn|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]].

=== All-linn&nbsp;– Lower Town ===
This area is one of the best preserved medieval towns in Europe and the authorities are continuing its rehabilitation. Major sights include the [[Town Hall Square, Tallinn|Town Hall square]] ({{langx|et|Raekoja plats }}), the [[Walls of Tallinn|city wall]] and towers (notably "[[Estonian Maritime Museum#Fat Margaret|Fat Margaret]]" and "[[Kiek in de Kök, Tallinn|Kiek in de Kök]]") as well as a number of medieval churches, including [[St. Olaf's Church, Tallinn|St Olaf's]], [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St. Nicholas']] and the [[Church of the Holy Ghost, Tallinn|Church of the Holy Ghost]]. The Catholic [[St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral, Tallinn|Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul]] is also in the Lower Town.

=== Kadriorg ===
{{main|Kadriorg}}

Kadriorg is {{convert|2|km|1|abbr=off}} east of the city centre and is served by buses and trams. [[Kadriorg Palace]], the former palace of [[Peter the Great]], built just after the [[Great Northern War]], now houses the foreign art department of the [[Art Museum of Estonia]], the presidential residence and the surrounding grounds include formal gardens and woodland.

The main building of the Art Museum of Estonia, [[KUMU (museum)|Kumu]] ({{langx|et|Kunstimuuseum}}, Art Museum), was built in 2006 and lies in Kadriorg park. It houses an encyclopaedic collection of Estonian art, including paintings by [[Carl Timoleon von Neff]], [[Johann Köler]], [[Eduard Ole]], [[Jaan Koort]], [[Konrad Mägi]], [[Eduard Wiiralt]], Henn Roode and [[Adamson-Eric]], among others.

=== Pirita ===
{{main|Pirita}}
This coastal district is a further 2 kilometres north-east of Kadriorg. The marina was built for the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics]] of 1980, and boats can be hired on the [[Pirita River]]. Two kilometres inland are the [[Tallinn Botanic Garden|Botanic Gardens]] and the [[Tallinn TV Tower]].

Buses are also available to all these and various other destinations in Estonia, as well as to Saint Petersburg in Russia and Riga, Latvia. The [[Russian railways]] company operated a daily international sleeper train service between Tallinn – Moscow, and was stopped in 2020.

Tallinn also has a commuter rail service running from Tallinn's [[Balti jaam|main rail station]] in two main directions: east ([[Aegviidu]]) and to several western destinations ([[Pääsküla]], [[Keila]], [[Riisipere]], Turba, [[Paldiski]], and [[Kloogaranna]]). These are electrified lines and are used by the [[Elron (rail transit)|Elron]] railroad company. [[Stadler FLIRT]] EMU and DMU units are in service since July 2013.
