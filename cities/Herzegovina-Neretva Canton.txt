The canton mainly comprises the [[Neretva]] river [[valley]] area and parts of [[Herzegovina]] west of [[Mostar]], its administrative center. It is one of the 4 cantons in the country with a Croatian majority (53.29%), although in the case of this territory it is more ethnically divided and is considered to have a mixed population.

== History ==
Before the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the present-day municipalities of East Mostar and Berkovići were part of Mostar and Stolac, while Ivanica was part of the municipality of Trebinje.

The history of today's Herzegovina-Neretva Canton begins on 18 March 1994, with the signing of the [[Washington Agreement (1994)|Washington Agreement]]. The canton was officially constituted on 23 December 1996 as one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Skuhan, Jasmin (16. 4. 2012). "Ustav HNŽ".

==Geography ==
[[Image:Stari Most September 2004 4.jpg|thumb|left| [[Stari Most]], Mostar]]

The canton is the only canton in Bosnia and Herzegovina with access to the sea via the municipality of Neum. Neum is a town of 2,000 citizens (1991 census) and the area around the city is rich with historical and archeological remains of the [[Illyrians]], a people who lived in the Balkans for many thousands of years.

The largest city in the canton and the fifth largest city in the country is Mostar. Mostar is located on the banks of the Neretva river and is divided between Croats and Bosniaks. Mostar is known for its old bridge, [[Stari Most]], which was constructed by the area's [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rulers, who also brought Islam to the region. Bosnian Croat forces bombed and destroyed the bridge on November 8, 1993. Upon its destruction, it had stood for 427 years and had become a symbol of a shared cultural heritage and "peaceful" co-existence. The bridge was reconstructed in the summer of 2004. The opening ceremony was attended by several foreign delegates including [[Stjepan Mesić]], the President of Croatia.

Other notable cities in this canton are Čapljina, Konjic, Jablanica and [[Međugorje]], the most significant Marian shrine in the region. Jablanica and Konjic are notable for battles which took place there during [[World War II]] and there is a large museum in Jablanica dedicated to these battles.

The [[Neretva]] river runs through the cities of Konjic, Jablanica, Mostar and Čapljina before it flows through Croatia and into the Adriatic Sea. There are large lakes in the canton, such as the Jablanica lake located around the city Jablanica. The southernmost municipality in the canton is the Neum municipality which borders the Adriatic sea and the easternmost municipality is the Ravno municipality along the border with Croatia.
