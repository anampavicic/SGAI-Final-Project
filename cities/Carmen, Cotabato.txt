'''Carmen''', officially the '''Municipality of Carmen''' ({{langx|hil|Banwa sang Carmen}}; {{langx|mdh|Inged nu Karmin}}, [[Jawi Alphabet|Jawi]]: ايڠد نو كرمين; {{langx|ceb|Lungsod sa Carmen}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Carmen}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Cotabato]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 79,140 people.{{PH census|current}}

==History==
Carmen derived its name from surveyor del Carmen, chief of the Cadastral Survey Party, who in 1924 conducted a survey in the area. During the American period, Carmen and Kabacan belonged to one municipal district under Pikit. It was by virtue of Presidential Proclamation NO. 46 and, was reinforced by Executive Order No. 214 issued by the then President Ramon Magsaysay last November 15, 1956 when Carmen was created as a separate and distinct town of Kabacan.

When created a municipality, it was composed of Thirty Eight (38) barangays. Ten barangays were either claimed or ceded to the two adjacent municipalities, Banisilan and President Roxas. Six by the municipality of Banisilan and four to the municipality of President Roxas. Now, only twenty eight (28) barangays remain in which are presently inhabited by the so-called Tri-people composed of the Christians, the Muslims and Indigenous Peoples belonging to the Manobo-Aromanon ethnic group.

Before it was named Carmen, early inhabitants called this large tract of land "Kalalaw" a Maguindanaon term meaning "jar of water", because legend tells that there was once a big Balite tree with a continuous reservoir of water under its dense foliage, that even in long dry seasons, it had never dried up.

Later on, when early settlers came and cultivated large portions of land in what is now the Poblacion, the whole place was unofficially called "Landing" because of the Landing Field reservation of approximately two hundred (200) hectares. The name "Landing" later on changed to Carmen in honor of del Carmen.

The present Christian in this place are an immigrants from Luzon and Visayas. They are brought here by sheer pioneering spirit inspired by widespread rumors of this "Land of Opportunity and Promise". Their settlement started during the American regime. When the Americans launched their policy of attraction to the Muslims providing advanced technology, economic and educational advancement and the art of government. The first Christian settlers came from Cebu and established settlements at Pikit. Then adventurers followed them from Luzon and Visayas most notably the Ilongos and the Ilocanos who came in great numbers.

The territory was reduced when, through ''[[Batas Pambansa]] Blg. 141'' of 1982, twelve ''[[barangay]]s''  were separated to create the municipality of [[Banisilan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Batas%20Pambansa%20141 |title=Batas Pambansa Blg. 141 |date=February 8, 1982 |website=Legislative Digital Resources |publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 10, 2024}}</ref>

===Manili Massacre===
{{Main|Manili massacre}}
The Manili massacre refers to the mass murder of 70-79 Moro Muslims, including women and children, committed in a mosque in Manili, Carmen, on June 19, 1971. The Muslim residents of the town had gathered in their mosque to participate in a supposed peace talk with Christian groups when a group of armed men dressed in uniforms similar to those worn by members of the Philippine Constabulary opened fire on them.

It was suspected that the Ilaga militant group were the attack's perpetrators, but there were also allegations that the Philippine Constabulary had collaborated with the Ilaga. No one was found culpable for the incident; Feliciano Lucas, also known as "Commander Toothpick", the Ilaga leader who was the prime suspect in the crime, was released after he "surrendered" to Ferdinand Marcos at the Malacañang Palace. The incident resulted in increased hostilities between Moro Muslims and Christians. In response to the incident, former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi provided military aid to the secessionist group Moro National Liberation Front.
