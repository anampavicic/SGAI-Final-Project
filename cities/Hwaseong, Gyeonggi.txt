'''Hwaseong''' ({{Korean|hangul=화성}}; {{IPA|ko|ɸʷa.sʌŋ}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], South Korea. It has the largest area of  farmland of any city or county in [[Gyeonggi Province]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hscity.net/english/html/data/data05_01.asp|title=+++ Hwaseong City (Fine City) +++|access-date=2004-12-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204214149/http://www.hscity.net/english/html/data/data05_01.asp|archive-date=2004-12-04}}</ref> [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] passes through Hwaseong, stopping at [[Byeongjeom Station]]. Suin Bundang Line also passes through Hwaseong, stopping at [[Eocheon Station]].

[[Hwaseong Fortress]] is located in nearby [[Suwon]].

==History==
During the time of the early [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], parts of modern-day Hwaseong was controlled by the state of Wonyang ({{Korean|원양국|爰襄國|labels=no}}), a small statelet that was part of the [[Mahan confederacy]].  In 1949, when [[Suwon]] was split from the rest of Suwon County, the remaining area of Suwon County was renamed to Hwaseong County, after [[Hwaseong Fortress]] in Suwon. On January 1, 1989, the [[Eup (administrative division)|town]] of [[Osan]] was promoted to a city, splitting from Hwaseong County. On March 21, 2001, Hwaseong County would also be promoted to the status of city.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:화성시(華城市) |url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0064683 |website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |access-date=12 November 2023 |language=ko}}</ref>

===Universal Studios===
On November 27, 2007 the city was chosen as the site for the future [[Universal Studios South Korea]] [[theme park]]. Originally set to open in 2016, it would have been the world's largest Universal Studios theme park, being larger than all the other four combined.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/01/117_59398.html|title=Will New Universal Studios Be Viable?|date=20 January 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124061222/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/01/117_59398.html|archive-date=24 January 2010}}</ref> The US$3.1 billion park was expected to create at least 58,000 new jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/5330802.html|title=Universal Studios picks South Korean theme park site|date=27 November 2007 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122152350/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/5330802.html|archive-date=2010-01-22}}</ref> In 2014, the project was put on hold. The plan was restarted in 2015, and K-Water (Korean Water Resources Corporation) was chosen as a business partner. Universal Studios South Korea is no longer under development {{As of|2020|lc=y|bare=}}.

==Climate==
Hwaseong has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), but can be considered a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') using the {{convert|-3|C}} isotherm. The city is located in the western area of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The temperatures in winter are low along the coast since it is located in the lower plains and close to the [[Yellow Sea]] (West Sea), where the water is shallow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.hscity.net/|title=Archived copy|access-date=2010-10-12|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121190753/http://english.hscity.net/|archive-date=2008-11-21}} Climate</ref>
Additionally, Siberian air flows directly into the western flatlands of the Korean peninsula, making several areas colder.

'''Administrative divisions'''

Hwaseong has 4 towns (eup), 9 townships (myeon) and 13 neighborhoods (dong). Each eup and myeon is further divided into villages (ri). In October 2014, Namyang-dong was downgraded to an eup- the first case in South Korea. Hwaseong's name comes from [[Suwon]]'s [[Hwaseong Fortress]], built by [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]].
The most populous areas of Hwaseong are Namyang (to the west), Hyangnam and [[Bongdam]] (central), and Dongtan to the east. Dongtan has had an SRT high speed rail station since December 2017. The [[Seohae Expressway]] runs through western Hwaseong, while the [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] runs through the east of the city..
