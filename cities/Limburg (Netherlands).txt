'''Limburg''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈlɪmbʏr(ə)x|-|122 Limburg.ogg}}, {{IPA|li|ˈlɪm˦ˌbʏʀ˦əx|lang}}), also known as '''Dutch Limburg''', is the southernmost of the twelve [[provinces of the Netherlands]]. It is bordered by [[Gelderland]] to the north and by [[North Brabant]] to its west. Its long eastern boundary forms the [[Germany–Netherlands border|international border]] with the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in [[Germany]]. To the west is the [[Belgium–Netherlands border|international border]] with the similarly named [[Provinces of Belgium|Belgian province]] of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], part of which is delineated by the river [[Meuse]]. To the south, Limburg is bordered by the Belgian province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]]. The [[Vaalserberg]] is on the extreme southeastern point, marking the [[tripoint]] of the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.

Limburg had a population of about 1,128,000<ref name="auto"/> as of January 2023. Its main [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipalities]] are the provincial capital [[Maastricht]] (population 120,837 as of January 2022),<ref>{{cite web |title=CBS Statline |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table |website=opendata.cbs.nl |access-date=2020-01-09 |archive-date=2018-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818214744/http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLEN&PA=37325eng&D1=a&D2=a&D3=0&D4=0&D5=71&D6=a&LA=EN&HDR=T&STB=G2,G1,G3,G5,G4&VW=T#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Venlo]] (population 102,176) in the northeast, as well as [[Sittard-Geleen]] (population 91,760, bordering both Belgium and Germany) and [[Heerlen]] (population 86,874) in the south. More than half of the population, approximately 650,000 people, live in the south of Limburg, which corresponds to roughly one-third of the province's area proper. In [[South Limburg (Netherlands)|South Limburg]], most people live in the urban agglomerations of Maastricht, [[Parkstad]] and Sittard-Geleen.

== Etymology ==
Limburg's name derives from the [[Belgium|Belgian]] fortified town of the same name, [[Limbourg-sur-Vesdre]], now in the nearby [[Liège Province]], immediately south of Limburg. The name of Limbourg-sur-Vesdre was important to the region because it had been the seat of the medieval [[Duchy of Limburg]]. 

There are several proposals concerning the etymology of Limbourg. The second part, "bourg" or "burg" is common in placenames, and refers to a fortified town. The first part is often suggested to refer to lime or linden trees (species of ''[[Tilia]]''). The historian Jean-Louis Kupper has proposed that its founder [[Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine]] named it after [[Limburg Abbey]] in Germany. He favours a derivation from a Germanic word "lint" meaning "dragon".<ref name="Kup">Jean-Louis Kupper (2007) Les origines du duché de Limbourg-sur-Vesdre", ''Revue belge de Philologie et d'Histoire'' Année 85-3-4 pp. 609-637 [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rbph_0035-0818_2007_num_85_3_5096] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602063407/https://www.persee.fr/doc/rbph_0035-0818_2007_num_85_3_5096|date=2018-06-02}}</ref>

[[File:3limburgen.png|thumb|160px|left|Map showing the two contemporary provinces called "Limburg" as well as the medieval duchy they are both named after. The small overlap is Teuven and Remersdaal, two villages in the eastern part of [[Voeren]], a municipality in Belgian Limburg since 1977.]]
Ironically the area under the direct lordship of the old Duchy did not overlap at all with the modern Belgian and Dutch provinces named after it today, though the medieval Duchy was a high status title in the region. On the other hand, while the Duchy's effective power was limited, the Duchy and what is now [[South Limburg]] (referred to as Overmaas) did have a long history of connection under the lordship of the [[Dukes of Brabant]]. During this long period, from the [[Middle Ages]] until the [[French Revolution]], they were sometimes referred to collectively under one name (Overmaas or Limburg).

After 1794, it was the French Republic which unified the region, along with Belgian Limburg, and removed all ties to the old feudal society (the ''[[ancien regime]]''). The new name, as with all the names of the ''[[départements]]'', was based on natural features such as rivers, in this case [[Meuse-Inférieure]] or Neder-Maas ("Lower Meuse"). 

After the defeat of Napoleon the newly created [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] desired a new name for this province. It was decided that the historic connection to the duchy of Limburg was to be restored, albeit only in name.

==History==
The current province Limburg of the Netherlands only came into existence in 1839, after the finalization of the separation of Belgium from the Netherlands which had begun in 1830. The two Limburgs had been brought together under French revolutionary administration some decades earlier, but they and the surrounding region shared much of their history. For long periods of history however, the region was not united under the same rule.

For centuries, the strategic location of the current province, stretching along the Maas river route, made it a much-coveted region among Europe's major powers. [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Carolingians]], [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg Spaniards]], [[Prussia]]ns, [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Austrians]] and [[France]] have all ruled parts of Limburg. 

The first inhabitants of whom traces have been found were [[Neanderthals]] who camped in South Limburg. In [[Neolithic]] times, [[flint]] was mined in underground mines.

===Roman era===
[[Julius Caesar]] conquered the area in 53 BC, and wrote that he had extinguished the name of the [[Eburones]], the inhabitants of most of the area of current Limburg, as a punishment for their revolt under [[Ambiorix]].

The north–south route along the Maas was crossed by the [[Via Belgica]], a road crossing South Limburg and connecting the two local capitals of [[Tongeren]] and [[Cologne]]. ''Mosa Trajectum'' (Maastricht) and ''Coriovallum'' (Heerlen) were founded by the Romans upon this route. The area became strongly Romanized. Bishop [[Saint Servatius|Servatius]] introduced Christianity in Roman Maastricht, where he died in 384. Maastricht appears to have taken over from [[Tongeren]] for some time as regional capital for the Romanized and Christian population, before the bishopric was re-established in [[Liège]], {{convert|25|km|mi}} south of Maastricht.

===Medieval era===
As Roman authority in the area weakened, [[Franks]] took over from the Romans, but the area came to flourish under their rule, with Cologne continuing to be the most important local capital. The Maas valley, especially the middle and southern part of the current province, formed an important part of the heartland of [[Merovingian]] [[Austrasia]].

With the rise of the Carolingian dynasty, who were themselves from this region, the Maas valley became more culturally and politically one of the most important regions in Europe. In 714 [[Susteren Abbey]] was founded, as far as is known the first [[proprietary church|proprietary abbey]] in the current Netherlands. The main benefactor was [[Plectrude]], the consort of [[Pepin of Herstal]]. [[Charles Martel]] was born in nearby [[Herstal]]. [[Charlemagne]] made [[Aachen]], today a German city which has suburban sprawl stretching into South Limburg, the capital of the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish empire]]. 

After the death of Charlemagne, the Frankish dominions were again split between kings. While the Austrasian lands remained a separate "Middle Kingdom", sometimes now referred to as [[Lotharingia]], in the treaties of [[Treaty of Verdun|Verdun]] (843), and [[Treaty of Prüm|Prüm]] (855), in the 870 [[Treaty of Meerssen]], signed in South Limburg itself, Lotharingia was divided. The river [[Meuse]] became the border between the [[West Francia|Western-]] and [[East Francia|Eastern Frankish]] kingdoms, placing most of the current Dutch province of Limburg on the western boundary of the Eastern Frankish kingdom, with Belgian Limburg in the Western Kingdom. In the [[Treaty of Ribemont]] of 888, the Eastern Kingdom was granted control of the whole of Lotharingia, including all of the modern Netherlands and Luxembourg, and most of modern Belgium.

The region of [[Thorn, Netherlands]] was drained and about 975 a swamp nearby the [[Roman road]] between [[Maastricht]] and [[Nijmegen]]. [[Bishop]] [[Ansfried of Utrecht]] founded a Benedictine nunnery. This developed from the 12th century into a secular {{lang|de|[[Stift]]}} or [[convent]]. The principal of the {{lang|de|Stift}} was the [[abbess]]. She was assisted by a chapter of at most twenty ladies of the highest [[nobility]]. 

During the period of West Frankish control under the Treaty of Meerssen, effective Frankish power in the area of the current Netherlands more or less collapsed. For two or more years a large [[Viking]] army, operating from a place on or near the Meuse called Ascloa (or Hasloa or Haslon), wrought havoc in the neighbourhood. The damage was such that the emperor, [[Charles the Fat]] was forced to assemble a large multinational army, that in 882 unsuccessfully [[Siege of Asselt|besieged this island]].

In the 10th century, the Eastern kingdom consolidated its control of Lotharingia and became the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the first decades of this empire the founding imperial family had close ties to areas in what is today northern Limburg. The emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] for instance was born in 980 in [[Kessel, Germany|Kessel]], practically on the current border between Limburg and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], just east from [[Gennep]]. In 1080 in {{ill|Genneperhuis|nl}}, just north of Gennep, [[Norbert of Xanten|Norbert of Gennep]] was born as a son of the count of Gennep. He was the founder of the order of the [[Premonstratensians]].

[[File:Overmaas.png|thumb|160px|Map showing the medieval "lands of Overmaas" and the Duchy of Limburg, both in the Middle Ages possessed by the Dukes of Brabant. Together these two counties formed one province in the [[Seventeen Provinces]]. (The dark lines are the modern borders).]]
South Limburg in the early Middle Ages was mainly made up of the lordships of {{ill|Land von Valkenburg|de|lt=Valkenburg}}, [[Dalhem]], and [[Herzogenrath]]. All of these lands were, however, united with the Duchy of Limburg, under the rule of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], when they were known collectively as the {{ill|Lands of Overmaas|nl|Landen van Overmaas|de|Lande von Übermaas}}.

The Duchy of Limburg and its dependencies first came under Brabantian control in 1288, as a result of the [[Battle of Worringen]], then in the 15th century under the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. By 1473, the Lands of Overmaas and the Duchy of Limburg formed one unified delegation to the States General of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. Both the terms Overmaas and Limburg came to be used loosely to refer to this sparsely populated province of the so-called [[Seventeen Provinces]]. Maastricht was never part of this polity: as a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]], sovereignty over this city was held jointly by the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. Also, the central and northern part of present-day Limburg belonged to different political entities, notably the [[Duchy of Jülich]] and the [[Duchy of Guelders]].

By the late Middle Ages most of the present day territory of Limburg had been partitioned to the Duchy of Brabant, the Duchy of Gelderland, the Duchy of Jülich, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège or the [[Electorate of Cologne]]. These dukes, [[prince-bishop]]s and [[prince-elector]]s were nominal subordinates of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, but in practice acted as independent sovereigns who were often at war with each other. These conflicts were often fought in and over Limburg, contributing to its fragmentation and a loss of economic importance.

Limburg was the scene of many bloody battles during the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648), in which the [[Dutch Republic]] threw off [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg Spanish]] rule. At the [[Battle of Mookerheyde]] (14 April 1574), two brothers of [[William the Silent|Prince William of Orange-Nassau]] and thousands of "[[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch]]" mercenaries died. Most Limburgians fought on the Spanish side, being [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]s and being opposed to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Holland]]ers.

===Early modern era===
In the early modern era, Limburg was largely divided between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (the [[Austrian Netherlands]] after 1714), [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]], the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and many small independent [[fief]]s. In 1673, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] personally commanded the siege of [[Maastricht]] by [[Early Modern France|French]] troops. During the siege, one of his brigadiers, [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan]], perished. He subsequently became known as a major character in ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] (1802&ndash;1870).

===19th century===
The modern boundaries of Dutch Limburg, along with its neighbour, Belgian Limburg, were basically set during the period after the [[French Revolution]], which erased much of the "{{lang|fr|[[ancien regime]]}}" of Europe, with all its old boundaries and titles. These two provinces were part of a new French {{lang|fr|[[département]]}}, named (like many {{lang|fr|départements}}) after the river running through it, "{{lang|fr|[[Meuse-Inférieure]]}}", meaning simply "lower Maas".

Following the [[Napoleonic Era]], the great powers (the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Bourbon Restoration in France|France]]) left the region to the new [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. A new province was formed which was to receive the name "Maastricht" after its capital. The first king, [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], who did not want the medieval name to be lost, insisted that it be changed to "[[Province of Limburg (1815–1839)|Province of Limburg]]". As such, the name of the new province was derived from the old Duchy of Limburg that had existed until 1795 on the east bank of the Meuse river.

When the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[French language|French]]-speaking Belgians split away from the mainly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] northern Netherlands in the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830, the Province of Limburg was at first almost entirely under Belgian rule. However, by the [[Treaty of London, 1839|1839 Treaty of London]], the province was divided in two, with the eastern part going to the Netherlands and the western part to Belgium, a division that remains today.

With the Treaty of London, what is now the Belgian [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Province of Luxembourg]] was handed over to Belgium and removed from the [[German Confederation]]. To appease Prussia, which had also lost [[Prussian Guelders|access to the Meuse]] after the Congress of Vienna, the Dutch province of Limburg (excluding the cities of [[Maastricht]] and [[Venlo]] because without them Limburg's population equalled that of the Province of Luxembourg, 150,000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hgisg-ekompendium.ieg-mainz.de/Dokumentation_Datensaetze/Multimedia/Sonstige_Gebiete/Limburg.pdf|title=Limburg (1839-1865)|publisher=HGIS Germany|language=de|access-date=2023-01-29|archive-date=2023-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230702100609/https://www.hgisg-ekompendium.ieg-mainz.de/Dokumentation_Datensaetze/Multimedia/Sonstige_Gebiete/Limburg.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>), was joined to the German Confederation between 5 September 1839 and 23 August 1866 as the [[Duchy of Limburg (1839–1867)|Duchy of Limburg]]. On 11 May 1867, the Duchy, which from 1839 on had been ''de jure'' a separate polity in personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was reincorporated into the latter with the [[Treaty of London (1867)|1867 Treaty of London]], though the term "Duchy of Limburg" remained in some official use until February 1907. Another idiosyncrasy survives today: the head of the province, referred to as the "King's Commissioner" in other provinces, is addressed as "Governor" in Limburg.

===20th century===
The [[Second World War]] cost the lives of many civilians in Limburg, and a large number of towns and villages were destroyed by bombings and artillery battles. Various cemeteries, too, bear witness to this dark chapter in Limburg's history. Almost 8,500 [[United States|American]] soldiers, who perished during the liberation of the Netherlands, lie buried at the [[Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial]] in [[Margraten]]. Other big war cemeteries are to be found at [[Overloon]] ([[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers) and the [[Ysselsteyn German war cemetery]] was constructed in the Municipality of [[Venray]] for the 31,000 [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers who died.

According to the research of Herman van Rens, the residents of Limburg were especially active in hiding local and refugee Jews during the [[Holocaust]], to the extent that the Jewish population even increased during the war. Jews in hiding were three times as likely to survive in Limburg as in Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cnaan Lipshiz | title = For Some Dutch Jews, Limburg Province Was Refuge in Storm of Holocaust | url = http://forward.com/articles/198437/for-some-dutch-jews-limburg-province-was-refuge-in/?p=all | journal = The Forward | date = May 19, 2014 | access-date = May 19, 2014 | archive-date = May 19, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140519184144/http://forward.com/articles/198437/for-some-dutch-jews-limburg-province-was-refuge-in/?p=all | url-status = live }}</ref>

In December 1991, the [[European Community]] (now [[European Union]]) held a summit in Maastricht. At that summit, the "Treaty on European Union" or so-called [[Maastricht Treaty]] was signed by the European Community member states. With that treaty, the European Union came into existence.

===Anthem===
''[[Limburg mijn Vaderland]]'' (Limburg my Fatherland) is the official [[national anthem|anthem]] of both Belgian and Dutch Limburg.

==Language==
{{main|Limburgish language}}
Although standard [[Netherlands|Dutch]] is the official language and the one most used, [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] is currently considered a regional language as described in the a page of the Dutch Government.<ref>{{cite web |last=Koninkrijksrelaties |first=Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en |date=2016-01-11 |title=Welke erkende talen heeft Nederland? - Rijksoverheid.nl |url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/erkende-talen/vraag-en-antwoord/onderwerpen/erkende-talen/vraag-en-antwoord/erkende-talen-nederland |access-date=2022-06-04 |website=www.rijksoverheid.nl |language=nl-NL }}{{Dead link|date=September 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It has been an official [[regional language]] since 1997 and it receives moderate protection under Chapter 2 of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. The [[Germany|German]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] governments do not recognise it as an official language. Before the 20th century, most newspapers were in [[French language|French]] or in German, and schools in Maastricht taught French, as the city has historic ties with the Belgian city of [[Liège]]. Other parts of the province taught German.

Limburgish is spoken by an estimated 1.6 million people in Dutch Limburg, [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]], and Germany.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} There are many different [[dialect]]s of Limburgish; almost every town and village has its own. A lot of [[isogloss]]es cross through Limburg. No single dialect can fully represent Limburgish as a whole. Dialects in the north, nearby [[Venray]] and [[Gennep]], are classified as [[Kleverlandish]] and are closely connected to the dialects in the northeast of [[North Brabant|Brabant]] (Land van Cuijk) and the region of [[Nijmegen]]. Dialects in the southeast (near [[Aachen]]) are closer to [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and are sometimes classified as [[Southeast Limburgish dialect|Southeast Limburgish]]. Dialects in the western part of Limburg, surrounding [[Weert]], are influenced by the neighbouring dialects of southeast [[North Brabant|Brabant]], which means that the tone is more [[Brabantic]] than in the rest of Limburg.

==Politics==
[[File:Provincial Government Buildings on the Meuse.jpg|thumb|300px|Provincial Government Buildings in Maastricht]]

The provincial council ([[States-Provincial]] - ''Provinciale Staten'') has 47 seats, and is headed by a [[King's Commissioner]] (''Commissaris van de Koning'') who unofficially is called the [[Governor]]. While the provincial council is elected by the inhabitants, the King's Commissioner is appointed by the King and the cabinet of the Netherlands. Since December 2021 [[Emile Roemer]] ([[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]]) has been holding the office of governor.

Since the 2011 elections the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) was the largest party in the council, although the [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) won the most votes during the election. However, two members of the PVV left the party, taking their seats with them, which lost the PVV their number one status.

Since the 2015 elections the CDA (11 seats) has again been the largest party, followed by the PVV (9 seats) and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP) (8 seats).

The province's daily affairs are taken care of by the [[Provincial-Executive (Netherlands)|Provincial-Executive]] (''Gedeputeerde Staten''), which are also headed by the King's Commissioner; its members (''gedeputeerden'') can be compared with ministers.

=== Provincial-Executive ===
The [[Provincial-Executive (Netherlands)|Provincial-Executive]] 2023–2027 consists of the following parties: BBB, CDA, VVD, PvdA and SP.

==Geography==
[[File:KernenNederlandsLimburg.jpg|thumb|479x479px|Cities and villages in Limburg including the outlying areas.]]

Limburg is a [[Salient (geography)|salient]] of the Netherlands into Belgium.

Compared to the rest of the Netherlands the southern part of Limburg is less flat, slightly undulated. The highest point in the continental Netherlands is the [[Vaalserberg]] (meaning 'mountain' of Vaals) with a height of 322.4 metres<ref>{{in lang|nl}} J.A. te Pas, Nederland van laag tot hoog, NGT Geodesia 1987 nr. 7/8 pp. 273-275</ref> (1,058&nbsp;ft) above [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum|NAP]], rising approximately 110 metres above the village Vaals, where three countries ([[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]) border each other at the so-called "[[Tripoint|Three-country-point]]".

Limburg's main river is the [[Meuse]], which passes through the province's entire length from south to north.

Limburg's surface is largely formed by deposits from the Meuse, consisting of river clay, fertile [[loam|loessial soil]] and large deposits of pebblestone, currently being quarried for the construction industry. In the north of the province, further away from the riverbed, the soil primarily consists of sand and peat.

Limburg makes up one region of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] world region code system, having the code [[ISO 3166-2:NL]]-LI.

==Economy==
{{see also|Mining in Limburg}}
[[File:Oekologisk-aeble-2001.jpg|thumb|Apples, with cherries, pears and prunes, are the major produce of Limburgian fruit-growing businesses]]
[[File:Baumblüte.JPG|thumb|Blooming fruit trees, a tourist attraction in southern Limburg]]

The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the province was €44.5 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.7% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €34,700 or 115% of the EU27 average in the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat|access-date=2020-03-07|archive-date=2020-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417095003/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the past [[peat]] and [[coal]] were mined in Limburg. In 1965–75 the coal mines were finally closed. As a result, 60,000 people lost their jobs in the two [[coal mining]] areas, Heerlen-Kerkrade-Brunssum and Sittard-Geleen. A difficult period of economic readjustment started. The Dutch government partly eased the pain by moving several government offices (including [[Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP]] and CBS [[Statistics Netherlands]]) to Heerlen.

The state-owned corporation that once mined in Limburg, [[DSM (company)|DSM]], is now a major chemical company, still operating in Limburg. In 2002 DSM sold its petrochemical division (naphtha crackers and polyolefin plants) to [[SABIC]] of Saudi Arabia. In 2010, the agro and melamine business groups were sold to [[OCI Nitrogen]]. [[SABIC]] is located on the [[Chemelot]] campus in [[Sittard-Geleen]], which is bounded by the Chemelot Industrial Park, one of Western Europe's biggest industrial sites. At this moment 8000 people work at Chemelot, of which 1000 are active at the Campus. The innovation and licensing division Stamicarbon of DSM was sold in 2009 to Maire Tecnimont, the parent company of an engineering, main contracting and licensing group that operates worldwide in the oil, gas & petrochemicals, power, infrastructure and civil engineering sectors. [[Stamicarbon]] is based in Sittard-Geleen.

[[VDL Nedcar]] in [[Born (Netherlands)|Born]] ([[Sittard-Geleen]]) is the only large-scale car manufacturer in the Netherlands, currently manufacturing [[Mini (marque)|MINI]]s and [[BMW X1]]s. Other industries include [[rockwool]] in Roermond, [[Océ]] copiers and printers manufacturers in [[Venlo]] and a paper factory in Maastricht. There are four large [[beer]] breweries in Limburg.

Southern Limburg has long been one of the country's two main [[Orchard|fruit-growing]] areas, but over the last four decades, many fruit-growing areas have been replaced by water as a result of [[gravel]] quarrying near the [[Meuse]].

Limburg is one of the most important provinces when it comes to [[Dutch wine]] production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tastytales.tv/blog/netherlands-wine-harvest-season-in-southern-limburg/|title=Netherlands: Wine harvest season in southern Limburg|access-date=2021-04-27|archive-date=2021-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427194230/https://www.tastytales.tv/blog/netherlands-wine-harvest-season-in-southern-limburg/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[South Limburg]] has the highest concentration of vineyards in the Netherlands. Limburg's wine regions have 3 [[Appellations]]: Maasvallei, Mergelland and Vijlen. Voerendaalse bergen is expected to be recognized somewhere in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/agrarisch-ondernemen/marktordening/wijn-en-olijfolie/wijn/europese-bescherming-aanvragen|title=Europese bescherming wijn &#124; RVO.nl &#124; Rijksdienst|access-date=2021-04-27|archive-date=2021-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427194558/https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/agrarisch-ondernemen/marktordening/wijn-en-olijfolie/wijn/europese-bescherming-aanvragen|url-status=live}}</ref> 

[[Tourism]] is an essential sector of the economy, especially in the hilly southern part of the province. The town of Valkenburg is the main centre.

In 2005, the two provincial newspapers, ''De Limburger'' and ''Limburgs Dagblad'', merged.

Essential elements in Limburgian culture are

* Music;
* Religion (predominantly Roman Catholic);
* [[Folklore]] (in especially the southern part of the province);
* [[Carnival in the Netherlands|Carnival]];
* Sports, of which especially [[bicycle racing]] and [[soccer]] are most popular;
* [[Art]] ([[architecture]], among others).

===Music===
Choral singing is popular in Limburg. One of its best-known choruses is the Mastreechter Staar (Maastricht Star), which performs nationally and internationally.

Every four years the [[World Music Contest]], a competition for professional, amateur and military band sometimes called the Olympic Games of brass band music is held in Kerkrade.
In 2013 and 2009 the winner in the World Concert Division was the Koninklijke Harmonie Sainte Cécile, from [[Eijsden]] (Limburg).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wmc.nl/nl/uitslagen.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805221141/http://wmc.nl/nl/uitslagen.aspx|url-status=dead|title=WMC Kerkrade 2021|archive-date=August 5, 2013|website=wmc.nl}}</ref>

Also held in Kerkrade (situated on the German border) is the Schlagerfestival, a nationally broadcast event presenting singers of German-language pop music called [[Schlager]]s.

Since 1969 yearly on the Pentecost weekend an international pop music festival called [[Pinkpop Festival]] takes place in the southern part of Limburg; initially at Geleen, since 1988 at [[Schaesberg]].

More nationally or internationally known musicians from this province are mentioned hereunder in section "Famous Limburgians".

The [[Limburg Symphony Orchestra]], that resided and rehearsed in Maastricht, and was the oldest symphony orchestra of the Netherlands (founded in 1883) following elimination of government grants merged with ''[[Het Brabants Orkest]]'' to form a single ensemble with the new name of the ''[[philharmonie zuidnederland]]'', as of April 2013.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/article/detail/3420234/2013/04/04/Gefuseerd-orkest-verder-als-philharmonie-zuidnederland.dhtml | title=Gefuseerd orkest verder als philharmonie zuidnederland | work=Trouw | date=2013-04-04 | access-date=2013-04-09 | archive-date=2013-04-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420103051/http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/article/detail/3420234/2013/04/04/Gefuseerd-orkest-verder-als-philharmonie-zuidnederland.dhtml | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Folklore===
Many places in both Netherlands' and Belgian Limburg still have their own (by now folkloristic) [[schutterij]]. An annual festival is held in which all 160 of them compete for the highest honours to be gained, in the "OLS" (Oud Limburgs Schuttersfeest), which is held somewhere in either Belgian or Netherlands' Limburg.

===Sports===

====Football====
In Limburg there are currently four professional Football clubs; [[Roda JC Kerkrade]], [[VVV-Venlo]], [[MVV Maastricht]] and [[Fortuna Sittard]]. Fortuna Sittard competes in [[Eredivisie|the highest Dutch division, the Eredivisie]]. The others compete in the second highest division.

====Cycling====
The annual [[Classic cycle races|bike classic]] [[Amstel Gold Race]] is run in the southern part of Limburg. The area has also staged the [[UCI Road World Championships]] six times, once hosted by [[Heerlen]] and five times by [[Valkenburg (city)|Valkenburg]].

====Handball====
[[Team handball]] is the third-most popular sport in Limburg. The women's team, [[HV Swift Roermond]], has won the national championship in the highest division 19 times. The male teams, [[HV Sittardia|Sittardia]] (Sittard), Vlug en Lenig (Geleen) and BFC ([[Beek]]), which in 2008 merged as the ''Limburg Lions'', have in total won the national championship 25 times.

==Religion==
Limburg is one of two Dutch provinces ([[North Brabant]] being the other) that has historically been dominated by the [[Roman Catholic]] faith. 

In 2015, 64.5% of the population of Limburg identified as Catholic, while 3.3% identified as [[Islam|Muslim]], 2.2% with the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], and 2.1% with other churches or faiths. Over a quarter (27.9%) of the population reported being non-religious.
