'''Cambridge''' is a city in the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo]], [[Ontario]], Canada, located at the confluence of the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand]] and [[Speed River|Speed]] rivers. The city had a population of 138,479 as of the [[2021 Canadian census|2021 census]].<ref name="Cambridge, City Ontario"/> Along with [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], Cambridge is one of the three core cities of Canada's [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|tenth-largest metropolitan area]].

Cambridge was formed in 1973 by the [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of [[Galt, Ontario|Galt]], [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]], [[Hespeler, Ontario|Hespeler]], the settlement of Blair, North Dumfries, as well as east and west Galt. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcambridgeontario.com/About-Cambridge.htm|title=About Cambridge Ontario, Canada|date=2015|website=City of Cambridge|access-date=March 20, 2017|archive-date=April 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428203520/http://www.visitcambridgeontario.com/About-Cambridge.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> The former Galt covers the largest portion of Cambridge, making up the southern half of the city, while Preston and Blair cover the western side.

==History==
The area today known as Ontario has been inhabited by Indigenous peoples since end of the [[Last Glacial Period|last Ice Age]].

===History of the City of Galt===
{{Main|Galt, Ontario#History}}

[[File:Old Post Office Galt Cambridge Ontario.jpg|thumb|Old Post Office in Galt, built in 1886]]
Galt is situated on land once granted to the [[Iroquois]] people by the [[The Crown|British Crown]] at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Young|first=James|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_26166|title=Reminiscences of the Early History of Galt and Settlement of Dumfries In the Province of Ontario|publisher=Hunter, Rose and Company|year=1880|location=Toronto|isbn=9780665261664 }}</ref> In the late 1700s, developers began to buy land around the Grand River from the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]] who were led by [[Joseph Brant]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}} One speculator, [[William Dickson (Upper Canada)|William Dickson]], a wealthy immigrant from Scotland, bought {{convert|90000|acre|km2}} of land along the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] in 1816; this was later to become Galt and the Dumfries Townships. Dickson divided the land and sold smaller lots, particularly to Scottish settlers. The centre of the planned community was built at the junction of Mill Creek and the Grand River, then called Shade's Mills.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Dickson decided to name the Post Office Galt, in honour of [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] of the [[Canada Company]] which was developing this entire area. Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840 and became the largest town in the Grand River area until the early 1900s. The town continued to grow, however, based on a large industrial base.<ref name="cambridge1">{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/Local-History.aspx |title=History of the Town of Preston |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Cambridge |publisher=City of Cambridge |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref> In fact, Galt was called "Manchester of Canada" because of the extensive industry, powered by the Grand River. Some of the important businesses in about 1870 included the Dickson Mills (opened in 1843), the Axe Factory forge, two furniture factories, The Dumfries iron and brass foundry, three large woolen factories, a malt factory, the Victoria Steam Carriage Works, the Dumfries Flour Mill, the Victoria Foundry making farm implements, a large soap and candles works and two steam-powered tanneries.<ref name="collectionscanada.gc.ca">{{cite web |title=Towns, Villages and Post Offices of the County of Waterloo |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p2.pdf |page=126 |access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref>

Records from 1846 indicate that Galt had very valuable water-power that allowed for milling and manufacturing. Stone buildings in the downtown area had already been erected and the population was 1,000, most of whom were originally from Scotland. Amenities included a curling club, library, a weekly newspaper, a school, a bank (Gore) and a fire company. The post office was receiving daily mail. Industries included two grist mills, two saw mills, two foundries, two carding machines and cloth factories, one brewery, two distilleries, one tannery, eight stores, nine taverns, two grocery stores and various tradesmen.<ref name="SmithsGaz" >{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The largest of the early schools in the community, the Galt Grammar School, opened in 1852 with the Dubliner William Tassie as headmaster starting in 1853 at the site of what later became the [[Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School|Galt Collegiate]]. The school gained widespread recognition and attracted students from across North America. By 1872, it had been recognized as a Collegiate Institute.<ref name="waynecook1">{{cite web |url=http://www.waynecook.com/awaterloo.html |title=Historical Plaques of Waterloo County |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2014 |website=Historical Plaques |publisher=Wayne Cook |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312051921/http://www.waynecook.com/awaterloo.html |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

[[File:Kids fishing in Hespeler, Ontario, next to a streetcar stop.jpg|thumb|right|An interurban streetcar connected Hespeler to nearby Preston and Galt.]]

The railway reached Galt in 1879, increasing the opportunities of exporting local goods and importing others.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |date=13 February 2017 |title=Growing Galt makes a grand view |url=http://www.therecord.com/living-story/7127326-growing-galt-makes-a-grand-view/ | work=Record |location=Kitchener |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref> The [[Credit Valley Railway]] planned to implement several lines running west and north from Toronto and in 1873, built freight and passenger buildings in Galt. By 1879, the company had installed a bridge crossing the river and in December completed a preliminary test run with a train; it was successful. The CVR venture was not long-lived, however, and in 1883, the line was taken over by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], which built a brick passenger building that still stands.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/8035119-flash-from-the-past-private-moment-goes-public-in-galt-rail-yard/ |title=Flash from the Past: Private moment goes public in Galt rail yard |date=January 5, 2018 |first=Rych |last=Mills |publisher=The Waterloo Region Record |access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref>

The first hospital in Waterloo County opened in 1890 as Galt General Hospital. Additional buildings and facilities were added in the early 1900s. By 1918, the facility had an X-ray room, a 27-room nurses' residence, and also served as a nurses' training school.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |title=Flash from the Past: Hospitals' history of growth a Cambridge-Galt|url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/9042867-flash-from-the-past-hospitals-history-of-growth-a-cambridge-galt-constant/ |work=Record |date=23 November 2018 |access-date=25 November 2018}}</ref>

A new streetcar system, the [[Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway]], (later called the Grand River Railway Company) also began to operate in 1894, connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to [[Brantford]]/[[Port Dover]].<ref name="CambridgeInfluence" /><ref name="Mills">{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |date=10 January 2017 |title=Flash From the Past: Preston Car and Coach goes up in smoke |url=http://www.therecord.com/living-story/7058983-flash-from-the-past-preston-car-and-coach-goes-up-in-smoke/| work=Record |location=Kitchener |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref> The electric rail system ended passenger services in April 1955.

Galt was incorporated as a city in 1915<ref name="ancestry1"/> and continued to grow due to a large industrial base.<ref name="cambridge1"/>

In 1911, most of the population of Galt were Protestant: 4,240 Presbyterians, 1,930 Anglicans, and 2,122 Methodists. There were very few Roman Catholics.<ref name="uwaterloo1911">

Not long after Galt had become part of Cambridge, in May 1974, flooding on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] filled city streets with water to a depth of about {{convert|4|ft|m}}. In some areas of the downtown core, the depth was {{convert|17.4|ft|m}}, smashing windows and carrying goods along the streets. Approximately 75 businesses were affected, with virtually none covered by relevant insurance.

===History of the Town of Preston===
{{Main|Preston, Ontario#History}}

[[File:Grand River Rwy car on Speed River bridge.jpg|thumb|An interurban streetcar connected Preston to neighbouring towns.]]

Preston was formed on land belonging to the German Company Tract, along the [[Speed River]], which was purchased earlier from the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations Indians]]. The name Preston is from the hometown of William Scollick, who was surveyor and a native of [[Preston, Lancashire]] in [[England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.ca/city_clerk/city_archives/historical_information_evolution_of_preston |title=Historical Information - Evolution of Preston |access-date=2010-05-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212040258/http://www.cambridge.ca/city_clerk/city_archives/historical_information_evolution_of_preston |archive-date=February 12, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In the 1800s a group of German-speaking Mennonites from Pennsylvania arrived in the area and purchased land. Among the first settlers to arrive in what was later to become Preston was John Erb, a Mennonite from Lancaster County, who arrived in 1805. He bought {{convert|7500|acre|km2}} including land at the confluence of the Grand and Speed Rivers in what later became Preston.<ref name="waynecook1"/> and later built a sawmill in 1806 and a gristmill in 1807. This settlement became known as Cambridge Mills.

Even in the early 1800s, the area included homes, a store, an inn, small shops operated by artisans and craftsmen, mostly immigrants from Germany. The Erb sons had hired William Scollick for their development business and the latter completed a full survey in 1834; he also convinced the Erbs to rename the Cambridge Mills area Preston.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |date=9 May 2015 |title=Flash From the Past: Trailblazers nostalgia behind Preston's name

What eventually became Preston started as a large settlement on the north side.<ref name="cambridge1"/>

There were only 250 inhabitants in 1836, many from Pennsylvania, but the population had reached about 1600 by 1855, with some 70% originally from Germany. By then, the area had eight hotels and taverns.

The Canadian Gazetteer of 1846 indicates a population of about 600 inhabitants, two churches, a post office that receives mail each day, a steam grist mill, and tradesmen of various types. At the time, there was no significant industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm. H. |date=1846 |title=Smith's Canadian Gazetteer - Statistical and General Information Respecting All Parts of The Upper Province, or Canada West |url=https://archive.org/details/smithscanadianga00smit |location=Toronto |publisher=H. & W. Rowsell |page=[https://archive.org/details/smithscanadianga00smit/page/8 8]}}</ref>

The Preston post office opened in 1837 and the population continued to grow primarily because of immigration from Germany. Preston was incorporated as a village in 1853. The population declined in the late 1800s but by 1900, it had increased to 2,000 partly because of the new electric railway systems that started in 1894. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.<ref name="CambridgeInfluence" /> This made visiting other communities and carrying of goods very convenient.<ref name="therecord.com">{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |date=10 January 2017 |title=Flash From the Past: Preston Car and Coach goes up in smoke

Due to continued growth, by 1879 there were many industries such as a foundry, carriage manufacturer, potteries and a furniture company. This was also the year that the Cherry Flour Mills started, which would later become the Dover Flour Mills, a Preston company that still operates today.

By 1888, the Preston Springs Hotel, then called the Del Monte Hotel, was operating.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |date=6 March 2016 |title=Flash From the Past: Preston Car and Coach goes up in smoke |url=http://www.therecord.com/living-story/6378036-flash-from-the-past-preston-intersection-is-big-part-of-region-s-history/ | work=Record |location=Kitchener |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref> Demolition of the building began in December 2020 for reasons of public safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2020/12/30/preston-springs-comes-down.html |title=Preston Springs comes down |date=30 December 2020 |publisher=Waterloo Region Record |access-date=31 December 2020 |quote=The building has been vacant for decades, and subject to trespassing and vandalism over the years.}}</ref> 
 
On September 30, 1899, Preston was incorporated as a town with a population of just under 11,000. The Great Road between Dundas and Berlin (Kitchener) as well as the railroad connections helped the community to continue growing into an important industrial centre. Products made here included flour, agricultural implements, furniture, stoves, shoes and textiles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooregionmuseum.com/collections-and-research/place-names-in-waterloo-region/waterloo-township/preston/ |title=Preston - Previous Names: Cambridge Mills, East Preston |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Region Museum |publisher=Waterloo Region |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-date=February 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227143523/http://www.waterlooregionmuseum.com/collections-and-research/place-names-in-waterloo-region/waterloo-township/preston/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Preston grew and continued to be a successful industrial area; expansion followed in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="cambridge1"/>

While most of the population of what became [[Waterloo County, Ontario]] was Protestant in 1911, Preston had a larger share of Roman Catholics, 844, while 862 were Lutherans, 707 Methodists, 704 Anglicans, and 525 Presbyterians.<ref name="uwaterloo1911"/>

===History of the Town of Hespeler===

{{Main|Hespeler, Ontario#History}}

The area that eventually came to be Hespeler was also on land (Block 2 measuring over {{convert|90000|acre|km2}} purchased in 1798 by Mennonites from Pennsylvania from the Six Nations Indians with the assistance of developer Richard Beasley. The first of settler, in 1809, was Abraham Clemens who had bought {{convert|515|acre|km2|1}} of land from Mr. Beasley on the Speed River. In 1810, Cornelius Pannabecker arrived and set up a blacksmithy a year or two later. Twenty years later, Joseph Oberholtzer purchased a much larger area of land that would become the early Hespeler.

Settler Jacob Hespeler arrived in 1845 and bought a {{convert|145|acre|km2}} tract on the Speed River. He built an industrial complex that was the beginning of Hespeler's future industrialization which would consist primarily of woollen and [[textile mill]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcambridgeontario.com/About-Cambridge-Hespeler.htm |title=History, Hespeler |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2015 |website=City of Cambridge |access-date=22 March 2017 |archive-date=March 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053227/http://www.visitcambridgeontario.com/About-Cambridge-Hespeler.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Records from 1846 indicate a population of only 100 inhabitants, a grist and a saw mill, a tannery, a tavern, one store, one pail factory, two blacksmiths, two tailors, two shoemakers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

In 1858, Jacob Hespeler opened the Post Office and the settlement, previously called New Hope, was incorporated as the village of Hespeler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p3.pdf |title=SW-Ontario-Counties_e010780571|page=151|access-date=10 November 2018}}</ref>

The arrival of the railway in 1859 helped businesses to develop and prosper. By 1864, there was a large flour mill, cloth and wool manufacturing plants, a sawmill and a distillery all built of cut stone. There was also a large furniture factory and four churches.<ref>{{cite book | title = County of Waterloo Gazetteer and General Business Directory, For 1864 | publisher = Mitchell & Co. | year = 1864 | url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p3.pdf | page = 150}}</ref>

Continued growth allowed Hespeler to be incorporated as a town in January 1901. Over the following years, the community continued growing slowly. By 1911 the electric railway system between Preston and Galt had reached Hespeler as well as Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.<ref name="CambridgeInfluence" /><ref name="therecord.com"/>

Textile production mills were the primary industry in the early 1900s and continued to be successful until the late 1940s, when this industry began to decline. Other industries continued to boom and by 1969, Hespeler's population was 6,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cambridgeweb.net/historical/hespeler.html |title=Brief History of the Community of Hespeler |date=2009 |website=Cambridgeweb |publisher=Cambridge Web |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312051825/http://cambridgeweb.net/historical/hespeler.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===History of the Village of Blair===

[[File:Blair GTR station crowd 1898.jpg|thumb|Crowd gathered in front of the Blair [[Grand Trunk Railway]] station in 1898]]

The land (west of what is now Preston), including [[Carolinian forest]], that would eventually become Blair was purchased from the Six Nations, through land speculator Richard Beasley. It was settled in 1800 by Samuel D. Betzner, one of the Mennonites from Pennsylvania. The group later discovered that Beasley had gotten into financial trouble and that a lien was placed on the lands. To solve the problem, the group created the German Company that bought an additional 60,000 acres of land from Beasley, who used the proceeds to pay off the debt on the previous lands. This ensured a clear title for the Mennonite group.

The first school in what later became [[Waterloo County]] opened in 1802 near Blair, then known as Shinglebridge. The first teacher's name was Mr. Rittenhaus.<ref>{{cite book |date=1895 |title=A Biographical History of Waterloo Township and Other Townships of the County |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htMOAAAAYAAJ&dq=1802+Blair+Waterloo+school+Rittenhaus++teacher&pg=PA25 |page=25 |publisher= Ã‰diteur non identifiÃ©|isbn= |author-link= }}</ref><ref name="visitcambridgeontario.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcambridgeontario.com/About-Cambridge-Blair.htm|title=The History of Blair, originally known as Shinglebridge|access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref>

By 1804, the first cemetery in Waterloo County had been founded. Also located in Blair, it is often referred to as the Old Blair Cemetery or the Old Blair Memorial Cemetery.<ref name="visitcambridgeontario.com"/> The first recorded burial was of an infant, the son of Mennonite settler John Bricker,<ref>{{cite web |title=Item 1989-1 48 - First death (1804) and burial in the Mennonite |url=https://archives.mhsc.ca/first-death-1804-and-burial-in-mennonite |publisher=Mennonite Archival Image Database |access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> who died on March 10 of that year.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Catherine |title=Mennonite cemetery offers glimpse into Kitchener's earliest days |url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/6257126-mennonite-cemetery-offers-glimpse-into-kitchener-s-earliest-days/ |access-date=11 November 2018 |publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd. |date=31 January 2016}}</ref>

Joseph Bowman, a man called Wismer and John Bechtel were responsible for the early development of the community in an area laid out by Benjamin B. Bowman. They built a dam, then a sawmill and grist mill. In 1846, a large flour mill opened, which was called the Bowman Mill, Blair Mill and also the Carlisle Mill.<ref name="collectionscanada.gc.ca"/> In about 1876, a 15-horsepower hydroelectric system, the Sheave Tower, was built on Bowman Creek by Allan Bowman to help power the flour mill using a series of shafts and gears. This was a significant achievement in that era.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://waterlooinsider.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/sheave-tower-blair-ontario/ |title=Sheave Tower, Blair |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Waterloo Insider |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref>

Although the name Carlisle (or New Carlisle) was commonly used then, the name Blair was chosen for the first post office in 1858 because a village of Carlisle had already been established in Halton County. The new name honoured [[Adam Johnston Fergusson Blair]], the first judge of Wellington District and a militia colonel in the area. In addition to Carlisle, earlier names for the village had included Shinglebridge, because a bridge with a shingle roof crossed the Grand River in this area from 1853 to 1857.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/Local-History.aspx |title=History of Blair |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Cambridge |publisher=City of Cambridge |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref> It was also called Durham (or Durhamville) and Lambs' Bridge.

By 1864, the settlement was receiving mail daily, had a large school, a Mennonite meeting house, a large brick church and a population of 200. Railway service arrived in Blair in 1873<ref>{{cite book | title = County of Waterloo Gazetteer and General Business Directory, For 1864 | publisher = Mitchell & Co. | year = 1864 | url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p2.pdf}}</ref> when the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], having acquired the [[Great Western Railway]]'s defunct [[Preston and Berlin Railway]], rerouted it through Blair on its way to Galt, bypassing Preston, the railway's original destination.<ref name=RR>

Blair became part of Preston in 1969. Many historic buildings still stand in the village, including some from the early 1820s. This includes the Sheave Tower (restored in 1999) and the John Bechtel residence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/resources/Blair-Village-HCDP.pdf |title=Official Plan, Blair Village |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1999 |website=Cambridge |publisher=City of Cambridge |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref>

===Galt, Preston and Hespeler Electric Railway===
A new electric street railway system, the [[Galt, Preston and Hespeler Street Railway]] (later called the Grand River Railway Company) began to operate in 1894, initially connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.<ref name="CambridgeInfluence">{{cite web |url=http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |title=Cambridge and its Influence on Waterloo Region's Light Rail Transit |date=19 January 2017 |website=Waterloo Region |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312053020/http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Mills"/> The electric rail system ended passenger services in April 1955.

[[Cambridge (federal electoral district)]] is represented in Ottawa by [[Bryan May]] (Liberal), the federal member of Parliament who defeated the previous incumbent [[House of Commons of Canada|MP]] ([[Gary Goodyear]], Conservative â€“ 2004 to 2015) in the October 2015 election. The second federal representative for Cambridge is [[Valerie Bradford]] (Liberal), who represents the federal riding of [[Kitchener Southâ€”Hespeler (federal electoral district)|Kitchener Southâ€”Hespeler]].

The [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] for the [[Cambridge (provincial electoral district)|provincial district of Cambridge]] is [[Brian Riddell]] ([[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]]), who defeated [[New Blue Party of Ontario]] co-founder [[Belinda Karahalios]] in 2022. The second provincial representative for Cambridge is [[Jess Dixon]] (Progressive Conservative), who represents the provincial riding of [[Kitchener Southâ€”Hespeler (provincial electoral district)|Kitchener Southâ€”Hespeler]].

==Municipal services==
The city is responsible for Community Services, Economic Development, Transportation & Public Works, Corporate Services, Fire Department and Planning Services. Many municipal services are provided through the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Waterloo]] (often referred to as Waterloo Region or the Region of Waterloo), which consists of the cities of Cambridge, [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], and the townships of [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Wellesley, Ontario (community)|Wellesley]], and [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]]. The region of Waterloo responsibilities includes Social Services, Community Health Services, Grand River Transit and Community Policing through [[Waterloo Regional Police|Waterloo Regional Police Service]].

===Hospital===
Hospital services are provided by Cambridge Memorial Hospital at 700 Coronation Boulevard. A small hospital in the Galt area had opened in 1890, the first in Waterloo County,<ref>{{cite news |title=Flash from the Past: Hospitals' history of growth a Cambridge-Galt constant|date=23 November 2018|url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/9042867-flash-from-the-past-hospitals-history-of-growth-a-cambridge-galt-constant/|work=Waterloo Region Record|access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref> while the current facility, originally named South Waterloo Memorial Hospital, was completed in 1953. It was expanded in the early 1970s with the addition of Wing B, the inpatient tower.<ref name="Who We Are">{{cite web |url=https://www.cmh.org/about/who-we-are |website=CMH|date=26 October 2013|title=Who We Are |access-date=30 December 2018 }}</ref> This facility began a $187 million expansion project in 2014 that was expected to be completed by 2019. The hospital summarized the plan as follows in 2013: "This transformation includes a larger Emergency Department and a 33% increase in beds to accommodate expanded mental health, medicine, surgery, birthing programs and so much more".<ref name="Who We Are"/>

[[File:Bank of Montreal building Cambridge Ontario 2012.jpg|thumb|Old Bank of Montreal building in Downtown Cambridge]]

Difficulties with the general contractor, [[Bondfield Construction]], which eventually went into receivership, delayed the process significantly. A news report on 29 December 2018 stated that "After two decades of planning and community fundraising, the expansion project, promising 54 new beds and a twice-as-large emergency department, is not quite half-complete and stalled". A consortium of banks, led by the receiver, the [[Bank of Montreal]], called on the contractor's insurer, Zurich, to activate its [[surety bond]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Banks take control of Cambridge hospital project|date=29 December 2018|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/9080473-banks-take-control-of-cambridge-hospital-project/|work=Waterloo Region Record|access-date=30 December 2018|quote=BMO, as a lender and funder, called a performance bond to ensure there is funding to get the work done. Zurich Insurance is Bondfield's insurer.}}</ref> That step provided the funding to continue work on the new wing to correct the many deficiencies; the process was moving slowly as of late April 2019. At that time, Infrastructure Ontario, Zurich Insurance Company and the project lenders were in discussions with a contractor who will be hired to renovate the existing B wing after the new wing is occupied. An estimate in late 2018 indicated that the completion date for the entire hospital project was 2021 at the earliest.<ref>{{cite news |title=20 Years of Frustration for Cambridge Memorial Hospital|date=29 December 2018|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/9101082-20-years-of-frustration-for-cambridge-memorial-hospital/ |work=Waterloo Region Record|access-date=30 December 2018|quote=It's been repeated stops and starts for Cambridge Memorial's long-waited hospital expansion }}</ref>

It will begin once the handover of the new patient care wing is complete and occupation takes place.}}</ref>

Part of the hospital expansion, the new patient care wing, was completed in mid-November 2019 and was scheduled to open in January 2020, after new equipment has been installed and staff have been trained.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kitchener.citynews.ca/local-news/cambridge-memorial-hospitals-new-patient-wing-to-open-in-january-1845849 |title=Cambridge Memorial Hospital's new patient wing to open in January |date=13 November 2019 |publisher=Kitchener Today |access-date=13 November 2019 }}</ref>

==Climate==
The climate in Cambridge is typical of [[southwestern Ontario]], and has a [[humid continental climate]] under the [[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] (KÃ¶ppen ''Dfb'') with mostly moderate winters but the occasional deep freeze. In summer, the temperatures tend to be in the high twenties on the [[Celsius scale]], and like most of southern Ontario, there can be stretches of high humidity creating some discomfort. On most days, Cambridge tends to be slightly warmer than Kitchener and Guelph, just to the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Federal and Ontario governments and the City of Cambridge came together and built the [[Drayton Entertainment|Dunfield Theatre]] in 2013 in an effort to promote Canadian talent and the performing arts.<ref name="infrastructure.gc.ca" >{{cite web |title=Lights, Curtain, Action!

In June 2008, the new Cambridge City Hall facility opened as the first city hall in Canada to achieve the ranking of gold in the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] from the Canada Green Building Council. The $30 million project was completed on time and on budget and financed through a settlement of a loan with the city's hydro utility. A conservative estimate comparing a standard {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building to the new City Hall LEED-standard building results in a $160,000 savings on energy per year or some $1.6 million over 10 years. The open concept of the facility allows for greater airflow, reducing cooling costs and increasing the penetration of natural light to offset other light sources. A four-story "living wall" of tropical plants is located in the atrium and cleanses the air of pollutants such as formaldehyde, [[volatile organic compounds]], dust, and spores. Behind the living wall is a running water supply that provides humidity during the winter months and a soothing sound for employees and visitors to enjoy all year round.

The historic city hall in Cambridge was built in 1858 by local architect H.B. Sinclair for $3,650, replacing the original structure built in 1838. Built of granite and white limestone, locally found blue granite was used as a decorative feature. The Historic City Hall served as the community's town hall and marketplace. Today, the Historic City Hall and the New City Hall are connected by a hallway constructed shortly after the New City Hall was built.

In the tradition of environmental stewardship, Cambridge preserves over {{convert|365|ha|acres}} of parkland which make up more than 80 parks in the city, as well as over {{convert|140|km|mi}} of on-road cycling lanes.

As of 2021, 54.6% of the population identify as [[Christian]] (down from 69.6% in 2011). Others identify as [[Muslim]] (6.8%), [[Sikh]] (2.9%), [[Hindu]] (2.9%), and [[Buddhist]] (0.7%). 31.4% of the population report no religious affiliation, up from 24% in 2011<ref>{{cite web |title=2011 National Household Survey - Cambridge |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=1159017&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=108259&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0 |website=Statistics Canada | date=May 21, 2014 }}</ref>

==Transport==

===Roads===
There are two main arterial roads that form an 'X' through the city. The intersecting point is colloquially referred to as the Delta. The intersection was once known as Hunter's Corners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/4334249--tbt-flash-from-the-past-delta-intersection-in-cambridge-wasn-t-always-so-busy/|title=#TBT Flash from the Past: Delta intersection in Cambridge wasn't always so busy|last=Fear|first=Jon|date=2014-01-24|website=TheRecord.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> The Delta is adjacent to a Canadian Pacific Rail spur and the Babcock & Wilcox plant, and at peak rush hour times traffic would back up for miles radiating outwards from the Delta. A number of strategies were investigated to alleviate delays caused by trains and as of December 2012 construction of a bridge over Hespeler Road commenced, and was completed 18 months later. While this eliminated delays caused by trains, the Delta remains a very busy intersection. Multiphase traffic signals with restrictions on right turns on red constrain vehicular throughput compared to typical signalized intersections. [[Highway 8 (Ontario)]] travels through the city as Shantz Hill Road, King Street in Preston, Coronation Boulevard, and Dundas Street, linking Cambridge to [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] in the west, and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in the east. [[Highway 24 (Ontario)|Highway 24]] runs through Cambridge as Hespeler Road, Water Street, and Ainslie Street, connecting to [[Guelph]] in the northeast and [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] in the south.

===Bridges===
Cambridge has some of the most historic bridges in Waterloo Region. The Black Bridge Road Bridge (1916) is Cambridge's only [[truss bridge]] and has been designated a heritage site since 1997. It is still driven upon, though it is prone to major flooding and subsequent closure in the spring. The [[Cambridge Main Street Bridge|Main Street Bridge]] (1931) is a [[Tied-arch bridge|bowstring arch bridge]] made of concrete and is set over the Grand River. Also in Cambridge is the Park Hill Road Bridge (2002), formally known as the Queen Street Bridge (1933).  This bridge was one of the three bridges credited with contributing to the development of early Galt. The bridge was reconstructed and widened to four lanes in 2002 retaining much of the original appearance. The Mill Creek Bridge (1837) in Cambridge is the oldest remaining bridge structure in the region and one of only two stone masonry arch bridges in the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/resources/Documents/Mill-Creek-Bridge-Plaque-access.pdf |title=Mill Creek Bridge |publisher=Region of Waterloo |access-date=January 21, 2022}}</ref>

In 2007, the Region of Waterloo completed the first pedestrian/cycling bridge to cross the 401. This bridge connects Morningside Drive (Cambridge) with Doon Valley Drive (Kitchener) and is an integral part of the Grand River trails system.

===Public transportation===
{{update section|date=June 2021}}
Since 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]] (GRT), which was created by a merger of the former '''Cambridge Transit''' and '''Kitchener Transit'''.  GRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge that provide service within Cambridge itself and service to Kitchener & Waterloo, including 1 [[Ion rapid transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] line and 2 limited-stop express bus lines. [[Ainslie St. Transit Terminal|Ainslie Street Terminal]] serves as the main transportation hub for Grand River Transit and [[Coach Canada]], while [[Sportsworld GO]] serves as the primary transit hub for [[GO Transit]] in Cambridge.

Frequency of transit may vary between routes. Some routes like 51 Hespeler may provide faster & more frequent service throughout the week, while routes like the 60 Burnett receive lower service and operate for lesser time.

[[Coach Canada]] runs almost every two hours during the daytime between [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], and connecting to [[Niagara Falls]].

===Railways===
{{Further|Galt Subdivision}}

The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[Galt Subdivision]] is the primary rail corridor in the city. It passes through the community of Galt, from which it takes its name, on an approximately eastâ€“west axis. It is a part of the Canadian Pacific [[main line (railway)|mainline]] connecting Toronto with points southwest. Other cities on the Galt Subdivision (from east to west) are Toronto, Mississauga, and London; the line also passes through the towns of Milton and Woodstock.

Although freight trains serving the [[Toyota]] factory are a common sight in Cambridge, the city at present has no passenger rail service. {{As of|2021}}, Cambridge is the only municipality in Ontario with both a population of over 100,000 people and no passenger rail service.<ref name=ctoday-gotrain-2021 /> The nearest [[Via Rail]] stations in the [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]] are [[Kitchener railway station|Kitchener station]], [[Guelph Central Station|Guelph station]], and Brantford.

The most easily accessible [[GO Transit]] railway stations are in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]],  [[Guelph, Ontario|Guelph]] and in [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]]. GO bus service between Mississauga, Cambridge, and Kitchener was introduced in 2009 as a forerunner to GO train service to Kitchener.

====Light rail====
{{See also|Rapid transit in Waterloo Region|Ion rapid transit}}
[[File:GPH-PB station and car barn.jpg|thumb|The car barn for the Galt, Preston, Hespeler and Preston, Berlin railway]]

The first appearance of [[light rail]] in Cambridge was an electric [[street railway]] system between Galt and Preston, which was called the [[Galt and Preston Street Railway]]. This later expanded with a [[branch line]] from Preston to Hespeler, and was subsequently renamed the [[Galt, Preston and Hespeler Street Railway]] (GP&H). A separate extension line, the [[Preston and Berlin Street Railway]], was built and then merged with the GP&H, and the whole system was renamed the [[Grand River Railway]], which at its greatest extent ran as far north as Waterloo. With this extension, as well as infrastructure upgrades, it became a true [[interurban]]. A sister railway, the [[Lake Erie and Northern Railway]], connected to the Grand River Railway at Galt, running south to [[Port Dover, Ontario|Port Dover]] via [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]], [[Brantford]], and [[Simcoe, Ontario|Simcoe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |title=Cambridge and its Influence on Waterloo Region's Light Rail Transit |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 January 2017 |website=Waterloo Region |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312053020/http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Mills"/> The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955.

In June 2011, the Waterloo regional council approved the plan for a [[light rail transit]] (LRT) service from Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo to Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener, with express buses through to Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |title=Rail plan passes |publisher=TheRecord |date=2011-06-15 |access-date=2012-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312025134/http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Phase 1, which started operating in 2019, the [[Ion rapid transit|Ion]] LRT runs between Waterloo and Kitchener, passing through the downtown and uptown areas of the two cities. The stations for the rapid buses along the southern half, known as Stage 2, were put in place by 2016.

Stage 2 of the rail line would run from {{stn|Fairway}} to the "downtown Galt" area of Cambridge. At least one journalist has pointed out the similarity between this plan and the electric [[Grand River Railway]] of the early 1900s that connected Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |title=CAMBRIDGE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON WATERLOO REGION'S LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 January 2017 |website=Waterloo Region |access-date=10 March 2017 |quote=the first electric line running up Water and King Streets from Galt to the Mineral Springs Hotel across the Speed River in Preston ...

He felt that a series of buses would be just as effective but much less expensive.<ref name=KWRecord2013-11-19/><ref name=Cbc2013-08-20/>

The Ion rapid transit service in Kitchener-Waterloo (Stage 1) began on June 21, 2019, after delays caused by Bombardier's late deliver of the trains needed for the service.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/news/story/2014/10/waterloo-region-s-rapid-transit-system-to-shape-growth-development.aspx |title=Waterloo Region's Rapid Transit System to Shape Growth, Development |journal=Metro Magazine |date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=2014-10-25}}</ref> Most of the rails had been installed by the end of 2016; the maintenance facility and all underground utility work had been completed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Desmond|first1=Paige|title=LRT construction 90 per cent complete|url=http://www.therecord.com/news-story/7035590-lrt-construction-90-per-cent-complete/|access-date=25 March 2017|work=Waterloo Region Record|date=23 December 2016}}</ref> The start date of service was postponed to early 2018, however, because of delays in the manufacture and delivery of the vehicles by [[Bombardier Transportation]].

[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|The original iXpress service which preceded the Ion rapid transit plan; other iXpress routes remain.]]

In late February 2017, plans for the Stage 2 (Cambridge section) of the Ion rail service were still in the very early stage; public consultations had just started at the time. Some routes and stops had been agreed upon in 2011, but the final plan will not be established until mid 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/lrt-ion-cambridge-region-waterloo-1.3970421 |title=There's still wiggle room in the Region of Waterloo's LRT plans for Cambridge |last=Sharkey |first=Jackie |date=8 February 2017 |website=CBC |access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/resourcesGeneral/FINAL_Stage-2-ION-PCC-No.-2-Display-Boards_reduced2.pdf |title=Stage 2 ION: Light Rail Transit (LRT) |last=Sharkey |first=Jackie |date=February 2017 |website=Region of Waterloo |access-date=24 March 2017}}</ref> No estimated date has been published for the start of light rail service to Cambridge.

Until the completion of Stage 2, rapid transit is provided between Fairview Park Mall and the Ainslie Street Transit Terminal (in the downtown Galt area) using branded buses with WiFi. Other stops for this Ion bus are at Hespeler Road at the Delta, Can-Amera, Cambridge Centre, Pinebush, and Sportsworld. The ION bus provides a direct link to the LRT half of the system in Kitchener-Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rapid Transit Environmental Assessment Phase 2, Step 3b â€“ Preferred Rapid Transit System Option and Staging Plan|url=http://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/projectinformation/resources/e-09-073_-_recommended_system_report.pdf|access-date=9 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  |title=ION Bus Rapid Transit - Frequently Asked Questions  |url=http://www.grt.ca/en/travelwithus/FAQ-ION-Bus-Rapid-Transit.asp  |access-date=24 March 2017  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024953/http://www.grt.ca/en/travelwithus/FAQ-ION-Bus-Rapid-Transit.asp  |archive-date=March 25, 2017  |df=mdy-all  }}</ref>

====GO train service proposals====
{{See also|Kitchener line|Milton line}}

In the years following the discontinuance of all passenger rail service to Cambridge, municipal officials lobbied for its return. In 2013, then-mayor Doug Craig reported positive results from negotiations with the [[Ontario Ministry of Transportation]] around an extension of [[GO Transit]]'s [[Milton line]] service from its terminus at [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]];<ref name=fast-track>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2013/11/09/craig-wants-to-fast-track-go-trains-to-cambridge.html |title=Craig wants to fast track GO trains to Cambridge |first=Greg |last=Mercer |date=9 November 2013 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]]}}</ref> both Galt and Milton are located along the Canadian Pacific Railway's [[Galt Subdivision]], which Milton line trains use. Craig pointed to the number of existing GO bus riders in Cambridge, as well as the number of Cambridge residents driving to Milton or to Paris, the latter to board [[Via Rail]] intercity trains which could reach Toronto in around an hour.<ref name=fast-track /> The full business case for the Milton line extension, entitled "Cambridge on the GO", was released in 2015.<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/resources/Cambridge-on-the-GO-Business-Case-Final-June-11-15.pdf |title=Cambridge on the GO Business Case |date=June 2015 |publisher=City of Cambridge, Ontario}}</ref>

In 2018, citing the inability to successfully negotiate with Canadian Pacific for further access for passenger trains along the Galt Subdivision, regional and municipal governments, along with Metrolinx and the Ministry of Transportation, began to pursue a possible passenger rail connection to the [[Kitchener line]] at [[Guelph Central Station]], using the existing CN Fergus Subdivision to reach it.<ref name=star-shifts-rail-line>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/local-cambridge/news/2021/05/10/proposed-cambridge-to-toronto-go-train-shifts-to-rail-line-through-fergus-and-guelph.html |title=Proposed Cambridge to Toronto GO Train shifts to rail line through Guelph |first=Bill |last=Doucet |date=10 May 2021 |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref> An early 2021 report detailed the second stage of the feasibility study, which addressed details around service levels and station locations.<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility>{{cite report |url=https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/living-here/resources/Transportation-Master-Plan/DOCS_ADMIN-3637986-v1-Cambridge_to_Union_GO_Study_Phase_2_Report_Final_Feb_2021.pdf |date=February 2021 |title=Cambridge to Union GO Rail Feasibility Study PHASE 2 REPORT |publisher=Region of Waterloo}}</ref> The report proposed a service launch of 2026.<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|19}} Proposed train frequencies would be between one and four per hour, with travel times of around 15 minutes.<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|20}} Ridership estimates for 2026 would be 80,000â€“385,000 per year in different scenarios,<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|27}} dependent on the level of infrastructure investment in the line. The study estimated a lower cost and travel time to Toronto compared to driving directly or using existing GO or Via services; this differential was projected to increase approaching the mid-21st century, driven by road congestion and the effects of infrastructure investment on the Kitchener line, which would decrease train travel times.<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|32}} The study also argued that the service would aid in intensification of development in low-density areas of Cambridge,<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|34}} be highly deliverable due to its use of an existing rail corridor,<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|33}} and improve labour mobility and economic development in Southwestern Ontario.<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|33}} The preferred station location was at Pinebush,<ref name=cambridge-guelph-feasibility />{{rp|iiiâ€“iv}} which is also planned to be an Ion LRT station, making direct transfers between the light rail system and Cambridgeâ€“Guelph trains possible.
