'''General Santos''', officially the '''City of General Santos''',{{NoteTag|{{langx|ceb|Dakbayan sa Heneral Santos}}; {{langx|hil|Dakbanwa sang Heneral Santos}}; [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]]: ''Ingud nu Heneral Santos''; [[Blaan language|Blaan]]: ''Banwe Dadiangas''; [[Tboli language|Tboli]]: ''Benwu Dadiangas''; [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Lungsod ng Heneral Santos''}} and abbreviated as '''GenSan''', is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] of [[Soccsksargen]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 697,315 people making it the most populous city in Soccsksargen Region.{{PH census|current}}

It is located on the island of [[Mindanao]], it is the [[Extreme points of the Philippines#Cities|southernmost]] and 15th-most populous city in the Philippines. It is the regional center for commerce and industry of the [[Soccsksargen]] region, and it is also the only coastal as well as the largest city in the province of [[South Cotabato]] wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] but administered independently of it.

== Etymology ==
The city was named after Gen. [[Paulino Santos]], a former [[Commanding General of the Philippine Army]] and the settlement's leading pioneer.

==History==
The nomadic [[B'laan people]] are the original inhabitants of present-day General Santos, and traces of their early settlements of the area are found in the city's place names, which are derived from their vocabulary. Their name for the city, ''Dadiangas'', is from the ''[[Ziziphus spina-christi]]'' tree that was once abundant in the area and is now a protected species under Republic Act 8371 or the Indigenous Peoples Right Act of 2007. The B'laan now lives alongside the city's new generation of settlers and other immigrants.

Beforehand, the B'laan would were forced upland into the surrounding hills after the Muslims settle in the area under the rule of the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]].

After the fall of Maguindanao, [[Datu Uto]] of [[Rajah Buayan|Buayan]] expanded his domain south towards [[Sarangani Bay]]. Dadiangas remained as a port under the [[Sultanate of Buayan]] until the American era.

===Waves of migration===
[[File:Monument of Gen. Paulino Santos.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of General [[Paulino Santos]] for whom the city is named after]]
Organized under the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Government]] headed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]], General [[Paulino Santos]] led the relocation of 62 Christian settlers from Luzon to the shores of Sarangani Bay aboard the [[steam ship]] “Basilan” of ''Compañia Maritima'' on February 27, 1939. The 62 pioneers, mostly agricultural and trade graduates, were the first large batch of settlers to land in the area with the mission to industriously cultivate the region. After this first influx of pioneers, more Christians from [[Visayas]] and [[Luzon]] subsequently migrated into the area, gradually driving some of the B'laan residents to the hills and mountains, where they have lost their livelihood and somewhat displaced [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaon]] living in the area.

In March 1939, the first formal settlement in the city was established in Alagao, which is now known as Barangay Lagao. Lagao was known then as the "Municipal District of Buayan" under the jurisdiction of the deputy governor of the Municipal District of Glan, until it officially became an independent Municipal District of Buayan on October 1, 1940, appointing Datu Sharif Zainal Abedin, an Arab ''[[Filipino mestizo|mestizo]]'' married to a daughter of a very influential ''[[datu]]'' of lower Buayan, as the first district municipal mayor.

===Second World War===
During [[World War II]], the Municipal District of Buayan become one of the last frontiers between the combined American and Filipino forces and troops from the [[Empire of Japan]]. Retreating Imperial Japanese forces made Klaja Karsts Land their last ground for defence, constructing round cement bunkers and tunnels. These bunkers can still be seen at Sitio Guadalupe; most of the tunnels, however, have since been damaged and even destroyed by treasure hunters and land developers.

===Renaming and elevation to city status===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
[[File:National Highway cor. Santiago Blvd. - panoramio (1).jpg|left|thumb|National Highway corner Santiago Boulevard]]
A year after the Philippines regained full sovereignty from the United States on July 4, 1946, the Municipality of Buayan became a 4th class regular municipality by virtue of the Executive Order Number 82, dated August 18, 1947, by President [[Manuel Roxas]], absorbing the Municipal District of Glan, whose low income bracket at the time disqualified it for the honour. Dadiangas was the seat of government for the Municipality of Buayan electing Irineo Santiago as its first Municipal Mayor on a local election that was held on November 11, 1947. Mayor Santiago was formally inducted on January 1, 1948.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.generalsantosboard.com/history.php |title=History of General Santos City |access-date=December 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711082830/http://www.generalsantosboard.com/history.php |archive-date=July 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Six years later, in June 1954, the Municipality of Buayan was renamed General Santos as a tribute to the leading pioneer via Act No. 1107<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1107-renaming-buayan,-cotabato-to-general-santos.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714205021/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1107-renaming-buayan,-cotabato-to-general-santos.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=An Act Changing the Name of the Municipality of Buayan, in the Province of Cotabato, to General Santos |publisher=LawPH.com |access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref> authored by Congressman Luminog Mangelen of Cotabato Province.

From 1963 to 1967, the municipality's economy experienced a boom under Mayor Lucio A. Velayo, as several large agri-based and multinational firms such as [[Dole Food Company|Dole Philippines]], General Milling Corporation and UDAGRI expanded into the area. Although it was then qualified to become a fourth class city from being a municipality, the residents rejected a move by Congressman Salipada Pendatun to convert the Municipality of Buayan into a city and to rename it ’’Rajah Buayan’’.

On July 8, 1968, the Municipality of General Santos was converted into a city upon the approval of Republic Act No. 5412, authored by Congressman James L. Chiongbian. It was inaugurated on September 5 of that year, with Antonio C. Acharon became the new city's first mayor. On September 5, 1988, a decade after its inauguration as a chartered city, GenSan was declared a highly urbanized city of South Cotabato.

Even after becoming a [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|highly urbanized city]] independent from South Cotabato in 1988, General Santos remained part of the province's congressional representation. The city only gained a separate representative with the passage of Republic Act No. 11243 on March 11, 2019,<ref name=ra11243>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2019/03mar/20190311-RA-11243-RRD.pdf|title=Republic Act No. 11243 - An Act Reapportioning the First Legislative District of the Province of South Cotabato, thereby creating the Lone Legislative District of General Santos City|date=March 11, 2019|accessdate=May 6, 2019|author=Congress of the Philippines}}</ref> which segregated General Santos from the [[Legislative districts of South Cotabato#1987–2022|first congressional district]] of [[South Cotabato]] to be its [[Legislative districts of General Santos|3rd congressional district]]. On September 15, 2021, House Bill No. 10021 authored by Representative Ferdinand Hernandez, that officially mandate General Santos as a lone district,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/third_18/HBT10021.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 18, 2021 |archive-date=September 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210915182737/https://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/third_18/HBT10021.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref> separate from South Cotabato was passed on third and final reading.

In April 2001, Mayor Adelbert W. Antonino, an ally of deposed president [[Joseph Estrada]], coordinated with various mayors and governors to bring their respective constituents to [[EDSA|Epifanio delos Santos Avenue]] in [[Metro Manila]] to [[EDSA III|protest]] the arrest of Estrada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gloria|first=Glenda M.|title=Remembering the Iglesia-led EDSA 3|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/104045-edsa-3-iglesia-ni-cristo/|access-date=March 7, 2024|work=[[Rappler]]|publisher=Rappler Inc.|date=August 29, 2015|author-link=Newsbreak (magazine)|quote=This story on 'EDSA 3'[...] was first published by [[Newsbreak (magazine)|Newsbreak]] in May 2001.}}</ref>
