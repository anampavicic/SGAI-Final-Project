'''Rivne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɪ|v|n|ə}}; {{langx|uk|Рівне}}, {{IPA|uk|ˈriu̯nɛ|IPA|Uk-Rivnesound.ogg}}) is a [[city]] in western [[Ukraine]]. The city is the [[administrative center]] of [[Rivne Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]), as well as the surrounding [[Rivne Raion]] ([[Raion|district]] created in the USSR) within the oblast.<ref name="zakon1.rada.gov.ua">[http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1183-XII On bringing the name of Rovno city and Rovno Oblast in accordance to rules of Ukrainian spelling] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005075442/http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1183-XII |date=2015-10-05 }}. [[Ukrainian parliament]]. 11 June 1991</ref> Administratively, Rivne is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the raion. It has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|243,873|punct=.}}

In the spring of 1919, it also served as a provisional seat of the Ukrainian government throughout the ongoing war with [[Soviet Russia]]. Between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the city was located in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] as a district-level (county) seat in [[Wolyn Voivodeship]]. At the start of World War II in 1939, Rivne was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and received its current status by becoming a seat of regional government of the [[Rivne Oblast]] which was created out of the eastern portion of the voivodeship. During the German occupation of 1941–44 the city was designated as a [[Capital city|capital]] of German Ukraine ([[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]).

Rivne is an important transportation hub, with the international [[Rivne International Airport|Rivne Airport]], and rail links to [[Zdolbuniv]], [[Sarny]], and [[Kovel]], as well as highways linking it with [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]], [[Kyiv]] and [[Lviv]]. Among other leading companies there is a chemical factory of [[Rivne-Azot]] (part of [[Ostchem Holding]]).

Rivne was first mentioned in 1283 in the Polish annals ''Rocznik kapituły krakowskiej''<ref name=eohou>Bovhyria, A.

Ukraine-in portal.</ref> as one of the inhabited places of [[Halych-Volhynia]] near which [[Leszek II the Black]] was victorious over a part of the [[Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army]]. Following the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]]'s partition after [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]] in the late [[14th century]], it was under the rule of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and in 1434 the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Švitrigaila]] awarded the settlement to a Lutsk nobleman Dychko.<ref name=eohou /> In 1461 Dychko sold his settlement to Prince Semen Nesvizh.<ref name=eohou /><ref name=ukraine-in /> In 1479 Semen Nesvizh died and his settlement was passed to his wife Maria who started to call herself princess of Rivne.<ref name=ukraine-in /> She turned the settlement into a princely residence by building in 1481<ref name=eohou /> a castle on one of local river islands and managed to obtain [[Magdeburg rights]] for the settlement in 1492 from the King of Poland [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]].<ref name=ukraine-in /> Following her death in 1518, the city was passed on to the princes of Ostrog and declined by losing its status as a princely residency.<ref name=eohou />
[[File:Zamek ks. Ludomirskich, Równe.jpg|thumb|Lubomirski Palace, 1945]]
In 1566 the town of Rivne became part of newly established [[Volhynian Voivodeship (1569–1795)|Volhynian Voivodeship]]. Following the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, it was transferred from the realm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the [[Crown of Poland]].<ref name=eohou /><ref name=ukraine-in /> The city had a status of privately held by nobles ([[Ostrogski family|Ostrogski]] and [[Lubomirski]] families). Following the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 Rivne became a part of the [[Russian Empire]], and in 1797 it was declared to be a county level ([[uyezd]]) town of the [[Volhynian Governorate]].

===World War I===
During [[World War I]] and the period of chaos shortly after, it was briefly under German, Ukrainian, Bolshevik and Polish rule. During April–May 1919 Rivne served as the temporary capital{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. In late April 1919 one of the Ukrainian military leaders [[Volodymyr Oskilko]] attempted to organize a ''coup-d'état'' against the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] led by [[Symon Petliura]] and the cabinet of [[Borys Martos]] and replace them with [[Yevhen Petrushevych]] as president of Ukraine. In Rivne, Oskilko managed to arrest most of the cabinet ministers including Martos himself, but Petliura at that time was in neighboring [[Zdolbuniv]] and managed to stop Oskilko's efforts. At the conclusion of the conflict, in accordance with the [[Peace of Riga|Riga Peace Treaty]] of 1921, it became a part of [[Poland|Polish]] [[Volhynian Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Volhynian Voivodeship]], a situation which would last until the Second World War. Before World War II, Rivne (Równe) was a mainly Jewish-Polish city (Jews constituted about 50% of the city's population, and Poles 35%). When Jews died during the Holocaust, Poles from Rivne were deported to Poland's new borders after 1945.

===World War II===
In 1939, as a result of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and the partition of Poland, Rivne was occupied by the Soviet Union. Starting December of that year Rivne became the center of the newly established Rivne Oblast in the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

On 28 June 1941 Rivne was invaded by the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th army]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. On 20 August, the Nazis declared it the administrative center of [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]. A [[Gestapo]] prison opened on Belaia Street.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/rovno2/files/Rovno_Burds.pdf |title=Holocaust in Rovno: The Massacre at Sosenki Forest, November 1941 |last=Burds |first=Jeffrey |date=2013 |website=www.jewishgen.org |page=86 |access-date=13 April 2020 |archive-date=7 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207113109/https://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/rovno2/files/Rovno_Burds.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>{{bsn|date=January 2024}} Roughly half of Rivne's inhabitants were Jewish. 

On 6–8 November, 17,500 Jewish adults from Rivne were shot to death or thrown alive into a large pit in a pine grove in Sosenki, and 6,000 Jewish children suffered the same fate at a nearby site.<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/2020-10-22/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/this-ukrainian-city-was-once-home-to-a-vibrant-jewish-community/0000017f-f50a-d47e-a37f-fd3e39c70000 This Ukrainian City Was Once Home to a Vibrant Jewish Community.

In July 1942, they were sent {{cvt|70|km}} north to [[Kostopil]] and shot to death. The ghetto was subsequently liquidated.

On 2 February 1944, the city was captured by the [[Red Army]] in the [[Battle of Rivne]], and remained under Soviet control until Ukraine regained its independence on the break-up of the USSR in 1991.

===Post-war era===
In 1958, a TV tower began broadcasting in the city; in 1969, the first [[Trolleybus|trolley]] ran through the city; in 1969, [[Rivne Airport|Rivne airport]] opened. In 1983, the city celebrated its 700th anniversary.

On 11 June 1991, the [[Ukrainian parliament]] officially renamed the city '''Rivne''' according to the rules of [[Ukrainian orthography]]. It had previously been known as Rovno.<ref name="zakon1.rada.gov.ua"/>

In 1992, a {{convert|20000|m2|acre|adj=on}} memorial complex was established at the site of the World War II massacre to commemorate the 17,500 Jews murdered there in November 1941 during [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|the Holocaust]], marking the mass grave with an obelisk inscribed in [[Yiddish]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Rivne |website=Information Portal to European Sites of Remembrance |url=https://www.memorialmuseums.org/denkmaeler/view/1164/Memorial-to-the-murdered-Jews-of-Rivne |publisher=Stiftung Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden Europas |location=Berlin, Germany |access-date=2020-02-05 |archive-date=2020-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206051435/https://www.memorialmuseums.org/denkmaeler/view/1164/Memorial-to-the-murdered-Jews-of-Rivne |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Industry==

During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times the provincial town was transformed into an industrial center of the republic. There were two significant factories built. The first was a machine building and metal processing factory capable of producing high-voltage apparatus, tractor spare parts and others. The other was a chemical factory and synthetic materials fabrication plant. Light industry, including a linen plant and a textile mill, as well as food industries, including milk and meat processing plants and a vegetable preservation plant, have also been built. In addition the city became a production center for furniture and other building materials. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

As an important cultural center, Rivne hosts a humanities and a hydro-engineering university, as well as a faculty of the Kyiv State Institute of Culture,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and medical and musical as well as automobile-construction, commercial, textile, agricultural and cooperative polytechnic colleges. The city has a historical museum.

Following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the monument for the Soviet hero [[Dmitry Nikolayevich Medvedev|Dmitry Medvedev]] was removed, and the [[Nikolai Ivanovich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] monument was moved to another location within the city. Instead, in order to reflect the controversial history of the region the monuments for "People who died in the honor of Ukraine", and "Soldiers who died in local military battles" were installed.
