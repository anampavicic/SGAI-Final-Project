Its distance from the state capital [[São Paulo]] is {{convert|443|km|0|abbr=on}} by highway, {{convert|529|km|0|abbr=on}} by railway and {{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} in a straight line. It is located at an altitude of 675 meters. The population is 240,590 (2020 est.) in an area of 1170&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>[https://archive.today/20150906140446/http://cod.ibge.gov.br/233FL Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]</ref>

==History==
[[File:Marília panorama2.JPG|thumb|left|Panorama of the city from a rooftop.]]
[[File:Japan fest.jpg|thumb|left|The city holds an annual festival of Japanese culture due to Brazil's large Japanese population.]]
In 1923, Antônio Pereira da Silva and his son José Pereira da Silva were the pioneers of the region, cleared land next to Feio and [[Rio do Peixe (Paraná River)|Peixe]] rivers. This land was named Alto Cafezal, or "High Coffee Plantation".

A city of Araraquara region deputy at the time, Bento de Abreu Sampaio Vidal held in 1926 a parcel of their assets.

In 1927, Colonel José Brás or Jose' da Silva Nogueira whose family origin in [[Itapetininga]], arrived in Marilia. His family held 40% of the farm land named Bonfim, and the process of urbanization began with the allotment of this farm.

Companhia Paulista Railway had been advancing its tracks from São Paulo to get to the town of [[Lácio]], and in accordance with its plan, the roads that were being opened at the branch were named in alphabetical order. The next branch should have its name beginning with the letter "M." "Maratona", "Mogúncio" and "Macau" were suggested, but Vidal was not satisfied with them. So, in one of his trips to Europe by ship, as he read [[Tomás Antônio Gonzaga]]'s ''[[Marília de Dirceu]]'', he chose the name Marília from the poetry book.

The city of Marília was created with this name by State Law No. 2161 on December 22, 1926, but remained as a borough of [[Cafelândia, São Paulo|Cafelândia]]. In 1928, Marília was raised to the status of municipality by State Law No. 2320 of December 24. Its anniversary is celebrated on April 4, 1929.

At first, the economy of Marília was based on the cultivation of [[coffee]], being replaced by [[cotton]]. The financial success originated from this latter crop led to the installation of the first two industries in the city (two cottonseed oil) in the mid-1930s. With the expansion of the industrialization in São Paulo state, rail and highways were also built, thereby linking Marilia to various regions of the state of São Paulo and northern [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]].

In the 1940s the city established itself as a development of the West [[São Paulo|Paulista]], when there was a large and growing urban population.

In the 1970s, there was a new industrial cycle in the city with the installation of new industries, specially food processing and welding. With the subsequent installation of several university courses, Marília attracted more people to the region, which accelerated the development of the city as a commercial & industrial hub.

Marília today has approximately 50 food industries in the area and it is known as the "National Capital of Food Processing."{{cn|date=March 2023}}
