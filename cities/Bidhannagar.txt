The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.<ref name="bmcwbgov1">{{cite web |title=BMC Profile |url=http://www.bmcwbgov.in/index.php/about-us/bmc-profile |website=www.bmcwbgov.in |access-date=14 September 2023}}</ref>
