'''Lingayen''', officially the '''Municipality of Lingayen''' ({{IPA|tl|ˌliŋgɐˈjɛn|}}; {{langx|pag|Baley na Lingayen}}; {{langx|ilo|Ili ti Lingayen}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Lingayen}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] and capital of the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 107,728 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the capital and the seat of government of the province of Pangasinan. Lingayen was a strategic point during [[World War II]]. It is also the birthplace of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]].

==History==
The Augustinian missionaries and the Spanish [[conquistadores]] drew a plan of Lingayen in 1614 and Lingayen was founded. The founders named the town Lingayen at the suggestion of natives themselves, due to a certain corpulent tamarind tree growing on the present town plaza at that time. The tree was exceptionally big, tall, and spreading; that the surrounding trees were just drafts in comparison. Passers-by developed the habit of looking back and back again at this corpulent tree until it would vanish from their rear view. When they arrived home and were asked what way they took in returning they would simply say "through Liñgayen".

The word "Liñgayen" was from the [[Pangasinan language]] word "lingawen" meaning " to look back". Since then up to the present time the town bears its name as Lingayen.<ref name="historical">{{cite web |url=http://elgu2.ncc.gov.ph/lingayen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210151101/http://elgu2.ncc.gov.ph/lingayen/index.php?cat1=2 |archive-date=December 10, 2004 |title=Jumpstarting Electronic Governance in Local Government Units- Lingayen (Historical Background)  |access-date=February 17, 2005 |publisher=Municipality of Lingayen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lingayen.gov.ph/?p=24 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110127170003/http://www.lingayen.gov.ph/?p=24 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 27, 2011 |title=Lingayen Official Website (Lingayen: "liñgayen") |access-date=November 6, 2010 |publisher=Municipality of Lingayen }}</ref> Lingayen became the capital of [[Pangasinan]] when the province became an [[encomienda]].

During World War II, Lingayen was invaded by the Japanese forces as one of the main targets due to being a gateway to the central plains of [[Central Luzon]] to race for the capital of Manila. During the occupation, Lingayen was a hotspot of US-sponsored guerrillas under [[Russell W. Volckmann|Russell Volckmann]]. On November 22, 1942, the guerrillas burned the bridge at Baay, Lingayen when the Japanese forces started conducting their mopping operations the same day.

On January 9, 1945, Lingayen was where the Allied armies landed during the [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf]] after the guerrillas have informed MacArthur that the Japanese had only a small presence in the area, giving the impression of being a safe place for the American incoming landing. Its long beach served as runway for several attack planes.

==Geography==
It is located along [[Lingayen Gulf]], the [[Agno River]] and the [[Limahong Channel]]. It has a land area of 62.76 square kilometers consisting of 32 [[barangay]]s and also has 7 [[sitio]]s. Its terrain is flat, suitable for farms and fisheries. Lingayen weather is cool from December to February, warm from March to April, and the wet season is between May and October.<ref name="historical" />

Lingayen is {{convert|206|km}} from [[Manila]] via [[Romulo Highway]].

===Barangays===
Lingayen is politically subdivided into 32 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].
