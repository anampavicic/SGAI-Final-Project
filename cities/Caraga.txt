==Etymology==
Caraga is named after the [[Kalagan people]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] "Caragan"), a [[Mansakan languages|Mansakan]] subgroup (related to [[Visayan people|Visayans]]) native to the regions of [[Davao Region|Davao]] and parts of Caraga who speak the [[Kalagan language]]s. The name itself is from ''kalagan'' (literally "[strong] spirited") which means "fierce" or "brave"; from ''kalag'' ("spirit" or "soul") in the native [[animistic]] ''[[anito]]'' religions. Hence, the whole ''Provincia de Caraga'' of AD 1622 was called ''region de gente animosa'', that is "region of spirited folk".<ref>{{cite web |title=CARAGA Region History and Geography |url=http://nnc.gov.ph/index.php/regional-offices/caraga/58-region-caraga-profile/322-caraga-region-history-and-geography.html |website=GOVPH |publisher=Republic of the Philippines |access-date=3 June 2019 |archive-date=August 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828202720/http://nnc.gov.ph/index.php/regional-offices/caraga/58-region-caraga-profile/322-caraga-region-history-and-geography.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
During pre-colonial times, the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] ruled in what is now [[Agusan del Norte]] and [[Butuan]]. It had much influence on all of Caraga, portions of northern [[Mindanao]], and the western side of [[Bohol]]. According to records, Butuan was in conflict with the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] in present-day Moluccas of Indonesia. The Ternateans would attack and ransack Butuan and its wealth, but Butuan always prevailed. Butuan had friendly relations with the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] which it considered an ally. It became a powerful Hindu state much known for its goldsmithing and boat-making. Its people used gigantic boats known as [[balangay]] which carried numerous men. Relics of these gold crafts and giant boats have been unearthed and preserved by the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] and other museums. Butuan also had cordial relations with the [[Kingdom of Champa]] in what is now central Vietnam. The Butuan people managed to cross the [[Sulu Sea]] and the [[South China Sea]] to reach Champa for trade. While the Rajahnate of Butuan was at large, the indigenous [[lumad]]s of the inner sections of Caraga were free and had their own highly advanced democratic societies, known for their knowledge of nature, medicine, mythology, and warfare. Chinese traders eventually came into Butuan and the Sino-Butuan trade became the focal point of Champa-Butuan relations, where the two nations competed against one another for better trade with the Chinese. Eventually, Butuan started to weaken due to massive attacks from Ternate. Cebu was unable to help at the time because it was also being attacked by Ternate. Likewise, the Kedatuan of Dapitan in [[Bohol]], "The Venice of the Visayas", was also destroyed by an attack from Ternate.

[[Rajah Siawi]] and Rajah Kulambo, members of the [[maginoo|nobility]] of the [[Surigaonon people|Surigaonon]] and [[Butuanon people]], respectively, were encountered by the [[Magellan expedition]] in 1521 on the island of [[Limasawa]] (a hunting ground for the rulers). [[Antonio Pigafetta]] describes them as tattooed and covered in gold ornaments. Pigafetta also records the name of the Surigao region as "Calagan". He also describes the "balanghai" (''[[balangay]]'') warships they sailed.<ref name=Nowell>{{cite book |last=Nowell |first=C. E. |year=1962 |title=Magellan's Voyage Around the World |chapter=Antonio Pigafetta's account |location=Evanston |publisher=Northwestern University Press |oclc=347382 |hdl=2027/mdp.39015008001532 }}</ref>{{rp|141â€“142}}


Linguist [[R. David Zorc]] suspects that the Tagalogs originated either in the general area of Caraga or  [[Eastern Visayas]]. He traced the origins and prehistory of the Tagalogs based on linguistic evidence. Tagalog is classified as a [[Central Philippine language]], and is therefore closely related to the [[Bisayan languages|Bisayan]], [[Mansakan languages|Mansakan]], and [[Bikol languages]].

When the Spaniards returned and subjugated the Rajahante of Butuan, already weak due to tensions with the Sultanate of Ternate, the boat-making and [[goldsmith]]ing traditions were eradicated and relations between coastal Butuan and the [[lumads]] of the interior became less known. The lumads of the interior were also converted to Christianity, which diminished some of their traditions on nature worship. The Spanish attacked the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] to negate any future attacks on Caraga, in which they succeeded, due to their much greater firepower. With the Spaniards having full control of Caraga, they started establishing Spanish-modeled centers to maximize their coverage and control over the territory, in which they succeeded. The Spaniards ruled the country until the United States defeated them in the [[Spanish-American War]] which led to the entire archipelago falling into American hands.

The "[[Kalagan language|Kalagan]]", called "Caragan" by the Spaniards, occurred in the two provinces of Surigao, the northern part of [[Davao Oriental]] and eastern [[Misamis Oriental]]. In 1635, Caraga was fortified by 45 additional Spanish soldiers and household [[Mexican settlement in the Philippines|heads from Mexico]], in 1670 a further 81 soldiers, and in 1672 still another 81.<ref name= "Mexicans" >[https://academic.oup.com/past/article/232/1/87/1752419 Convicts or Conquistadores?

In the early years of the Caraga Region, its inhabitants reportedly came from mainland Asia, followed by Malayans, Arabs, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and Americans. Migrants from the Visayan and Luzon provinces later settled in the area. Most of its inhabitants speak [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and live in rural areas.

On February 23, 1995, the Caraga Region was created through Republic Act No. 7901 in the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel Ramos]]. The creation of Caraga Region is the revival of the Spanish province of the same name. The provinces of [[Agusan del Norte]], [[Agusan del Sur]] and [[Surigao del Norte]] (of the former [[Northern Mindanao]] region) and [[Surigao del Sur]] (of the former [[Davao Region|Southern Mindanao region]]) were annexed as part of the newly created region.

==Geography==
Caraga Region, situated in the northeast section of Mindanao, is between 8&nbsp;00' to 10&nbsp;30' N. latitude and 125&nbsp;15' to 126&nbsp;30' E. longitude. It is bounded on the north by the [[Bohol Sea]]; on the south by the provinces of [[Davao del Norte]], [[Davao de Oro]] and [[Davao Oriental]] of [[Davao Region|Region XI]]; on the west by [[Bukidnon]] and [[Misamis Oriental]] of [[Northern Mindanao|Region X]]; and on the east by the [[Philippine Sea]] of the Pacific Ocean.

The region has a total land area of {{convert|18,846.97|km2}}, representing 6.3% of the country's total land area and 18.5% of the island of Mindanao. 47.6% of the total land area of the region belongs to the province of Agusan del Sur. Of the total land area, 71.22% is forestland and 28.78% is alienable and disposable land. Major land uses include forestland comprising 31.36% and 23.98% of agricultural and open spaces.

===Topography===
The region is characterized by mountainous areas, flat and rolling lands. Mountain ranges divide Agusan and Surigao provinces and sub-ranges separate most of the lowlands along the Pacific coast. The most productive agricultural area of the region lies along the [[Agusan River]] Basin. The well-known [[Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary|Agusan Marsh]] sits in the middle of Agusan del Sur. Among the lakes in the region, [[Lake Mainit]] is the widest. It traverses eight municipalities: [[Alegria, Surigao del Norte|Alegria]], [[Tubod, Surigao del Norte|Tubod]], [[Mainit, Surigao del Norte|Mainit]] and [[Sison, Surigao del Norte|Sison]] in Surigao del Norte, and [[Tubay, Agusan del Norte|Tubay]], [[Santiago, Agusan del Norte|Santiago]], [[Jabonga, Agusan del Norte|Jabonga]] and [[Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte|Kitcharao]] in Agusan del Norte.

===Climate===
Caraga Region has Type II climate, with no pronounced wet and dry season. During the months of November to February, heavy rains are usually experienced in the region.

==Administrative divisions==
{{stack|float=right|[[File:Ph caraga.png|thumb|right|Map of Caraga]]}}

===Provinces===
Caraga comprises 5 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], 1 [[Philippine city#City classification|''highly urbanized'' city]], 5 ''component'' cities, 67 [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]], and 1,311 [[barangay]]s.

==Economy==
{{stack|float=left|{{PH poverty incidence}}}}
From 2001 to 2003, Caraga Region consistently maintained its performance vis-Ã -vis other regions in Mindanao. Caraga posted a 0.9% growth rate compared to the 9.5% growth rate of Region 12 and the 2.6% growth rate of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Caraga's growth rate in 2001â€“2002 and the 2002â€“2003 period was the same (0.9%). This was much less than the growth of the population. This performance was better however than the region's performance in the 2000â€“2001 period, where the region's economy declined by 1.4%.

The region's contribution to Mindanao's domestic product is 7.58% in 2003. Caraga has the second lowest per capital income among Mindanao regions and nationwide. In 2003, the region accounted for 1.35% of the country's GNP.

===Poverty rate===
Poverty in the region decreased by 1.7% from 44.7% in 1997 to 42.9% in 2000. Another positive development is the increase in the regional annual family income based on the 1997 and 2000 Family Income and Expenditure Survey, which increased by 13.65% from â‚±71,7126.00 in 1997 to â‚±81,519.00 in 2000. Regional annual family expenditures also posted a 16.65% increase, from â‚±61,815.00 in 1997 to â‚±72,108.00 in 2000. The average annual savings slipped by 5% from â‚±9,911.00 to â‚±9,411.00. Poverty incidence data for 2003 is not yet available.<ref name="CRDP 2004-2010">Caraga Regional Development Plan 2004-2010{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}</ref>

On a national and Mindanao-wide perspective, Caraga Region is one of the most impoverished regions in the country. The region has the fourth highest poverty incidence level of families among all the regions in the country for years 1997 and 2000 while among Mindanao regions, Caraga has the third highest poverty incidence (in terms of incidence of families).<ref name="CRDP 2004-2010"/>

===Gross regional domestic product (GRDP)===
[[File:Downtown Butuan City (Original Work).jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Butuan]]

The region performed fairly well in terms of regional output contributing 8.01% in 1998, 8.25% in 1999 and 8.29% in 2000 to the Mindanao GRDP. The region contributed 1.44% in 1998, 1.48% in 1999 and 1.50% in 2000, to the Philippine economy. In terms of growth rate, the region accelerated faster and outpaced the other regions in Mindanao from 1998 to 2000, except for the Southern Mindanao Region which posted a 6.06% increase in 1999â€“2000. Caraga Region recorded a 5.42% increase during the same period.

GRDP in 2000 amounted to P14.336 billion as against the 1999 performance of P13.599 billion. The deceleration of the region's economy from 6.03% in 1999 to 5.42% in 2000 was attributed to the slowdown of the agriculture, fishery and forestry (AFF) and services sectors. The improved performance of the Industry sector, from 5.69% in 1999 to 6.69% in 2000, cushioned the effects of what could have been a slowdown of the region's economy.

From the 1.4% decrease in the GRDP in 2000â€“2001, the GRDP bounced back in 2001â€“2002 by a 0.9% growth. The positive trend was maintained in 2002â€“2003, with the region's GRDP growing by 0.9%, the same growth rate from the previous year.

The agriculture, fishery and forestry (AFF) sector is Caraga's banner economic sector, exhibiting an increasing growth trend of 3.8% and 6.8% growth rates in 2001 and 2003 respectively. Despite the decreasing growth trend of the agriculture and fishery subsectors, the sizeable growth rate of the forestry subsector more than compensated for the decrease. The forestry subsector grew by 36.3% in 2003, the highest growth rate for any subsector in the region. Caraga Region has the highest GVA in the forestry subsector among all regions in the Philippines.

The services sector is also one of the bright spots in the region's economy. After experiencing a decelerated growth rate in 2002 compared to the previous year's 6.1% growth rate, the sector bounced back in 2003 with a 5.6% growth rate. Moreover, the trade subsector continued to be the dominant subsector posting a 5.6%, 6.6% and 6.3% growth rate in 2001 to 2003 respectively. It is significant to note that all the subsectors posted positive growth rates in 2001 and 2003. The transportation, communication and storage sub-sector posted the highest growth rate of 8.4% among the sub-sectors in the services sector.

The industry sector was the worst performing sector of the regional economy with a continuous decline from 2001 to 2003. Although the sector's slide slightly decelerated in 2002 (-6.7% in 2002 from -13.3% decline in 2001), it contracted by -12.1% in 2003. The construction subsector had the largest decline of 16.6%, 11.3% and 33.5% in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively. The mining subsector also posted negative growth rates but the decreasing trend in this subsector decelerated. The manufacturing offset the decrease in the two sub-sectors by growing at 8.9% in 2003, making it the biggest contributor to this sector. Even with the negative performance of the mining and quarrying sector, Caraga was the second highest producer of metallic minerals, with metallic mineral productions valued at PhP 1.25 billion in 2001 (Philippine Yearbook, 2003).

===Exports and investments===
[[File:SM CITY BUTUAN (MAY 6, 2020).jpg|thumb|[[SM City Butuan]], the first [[SM Supermalls|SM Mall]] in the region]]
Investments in the region fell by 25.4% from PhP 6.3 billion in 2002 to PhP 4.6 billion in 2003. All provinces in the region posted a negative growth rate in investments, with Agusan del Sur posting the biggest year-on-year decline of 62.6% for the 2002â€“2003 period. Agusan del Norte's percentage share on investments increased from 64.8% to 79.5% despite an 8.5% decline. Per advice of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-Caraga office, the data on investments are partial at best and is not reflective of the whole investment level in the region. DTI Caraga's data does not include public investment figures.

Exports decreased by 19.08% in the 2000â€“2001 period and 57.52% in 2001â€“2002. Agusan Norte, Surigao Norte and Surigao Sur posted negative growth rates in the 2000â€“2001 period, with Surigao Sur posting the biggest decrease in exports (81.31%). In 2002, Agusan Norte posted an impressive 741.04% increase in exports, a harbinger of increased economic activity in the province. Surigao Norte posted the biggest decrease in exports for 2002 (63.17%).

In 2000, the region contributed 1.87% to Mindanao's exports; this expanded to 2.68% in 2001 only to decrease to 0.77% in 2002.<ref name="CRDP 2004-2010"/>

===Natural resources===
The region is noted for its wood-based economy, its extensive water resources and its rich mineral deposits such as iron, gold, silver, nickel, chromite, manganese and copper. Its leading crops are palay (rice), banana and coconut.

The region features several beaches, abundant seafood, hot and cold springs, evergreen forests and balmy weather. Caraga's most famous attraction today is Siargao Island, a surfing destination in Dinagat Islands.

===Major products===
Major agricultural products of the region include palay, corn, coconut, gold, banana, rubber, oil palm, calamansi, prawns, [[milkfish]], crabs, seaweeds and mango. Caraga's proximity to Cebu and Manila makes it a favorable shipping point for products to and from these markets. Nasipit Port can serve as a secondary shipping hub to Cagayan de Oro when traffic volume from other points in Mindanao increases. With a roll-on, roll-off (RORO) ferry service now in place, Surigao City serves as a vital transportation link for trucks and buses bound for Luzon.

Supporting the education of the region in 1997 were the 1,478 public and 49 private elementary schools, 110 public and 71 private secondary schools, 26 secondary school annexes, and 7 vocational schools.

The region has a total of 49 higher education institutions comprising 45 private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and 4 State Universities and Colleges (SUCs). Among the Higher Education Institutions, San Nicolas College (now St. Paul University-Surigao and first university established in the entire region) is identified as the center for development in teacher education and the regional center for [[Gender and Development]], it being the seat of Caraga Women's resources center.

The Caraga State University (CSU) formerly known as Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology (NORMISIST), is among the 112 state-funded universities and colleges in the Philippines. It is identified by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as the Center of Development (COD) in Information Technology, COD in Biology, and COD in Mathematics. It is the seat of the Caraga Center for Research in Environmental Management and Eco-governance (CREME), formerly known as the Caraga Center for Environmental Studies and Management (CCESM), which acts as the focal point of capability building and coordination for environmental efforts in the region. The university, through the Caraga Center for Geo-informatics (CCGeo), is also the lead implementing agency of the Geo-SAFER Mindanao (Geo-informatics for the Systematic Assessment of Flood Effects and Risks for a Resilient Mindanao), a research program that utilizes LiDAR data for mapping flood risk areas towards building a resilient Mindanao. CSU is producing Board Topnotchers in Forestry, Geodetic Engineering, Mining Engineering, and Agricultural Engineering, and has strengthened its research and innovation system through the years which resulted to its recent status as a Level IV State University, recognized by CHED as excellent in Teaching and Research.

[[Father Saturnino Urios University]], was founded by Caraga's most loved Spanish missionary, Fr. Saturnino Urios S.J. in 1990. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) recognized [[Father Saturnino Urios University]] as one of the best schools in the region producing top notchers in national board examinations in Nursing, Engineering, and Accountancy. Its performance in the Licensure Examinations for Teachers (LET) and the Philippine Bar (BAR) is also relatively high. On July 12, 2006, Urios College formally announced its elevation into a university and is now renamed Fr. Saturnino Urios University (FSUU), the first home-grown university in Caraga.

For the school year 1996â€“1997, the participation rate for public elementary schools was 93.65%. Public secondary schools registered a lower rate, 56%. The teacher-to-pupil ratios for both levels were within the standard of one teacher per 40 pupils. Cohort survival rates were considered low for both the elementary and secondary levels at 66.23% and 68.93%, respectively. For the school year 1996â€“97, dropout rate at the secondary level was high, especially in Butuan (9.5%) and Surigao Del Sur (7.8%). This can be one of the causes why the majority of the population finished only up to the elementary school level.

===Health and nutrition===
[[File:D.O. Plaza Memorial Hospital, Patin-ay, Prosperidad (Original Work).jpg|thumb|Democrito O. Plaza Memorial Hospital in [[Prosperidad]]. Opened in 2017.]]
All the vital health indicators from 1992 to 1997 showed a decreasing trend except for maternal mortality rate. The crude birth rate decreased from the 1992â€“1996 five-year average of 21.02 to 18.71 in 1997. The crude death rate also decreased from 3.60 in the 1992â€“1996 average to 3.0 in 1997. The infant mortality rate increased from an average of 1.33 in 1992â€“1996 to 1.56 in 1997.

All of the leading causes of morbidity from 1992 to 1997 were communicable diseases, and showed a reduction in rates for every 1,000,000 population, except for pneumonia (836.30 to 1,200.23), diarrhea (1,059.40 to 1,133.11), influenza (655.36 to 926.74), and malaria (216.80 to 366.5). With regards to the leading causes of mortality, lifestyle-related diseases like cardiovascular diseases and cancer top the list, replacing the communicable diseases.

The region is faced with problems of endemic diseases like [[schistosomiasis]] and [[malaria]]. Although there was a slight reduction in its prevalence for the past three years, still Caraga ranked as number two in schistosomiasis cases and number six in malaria cases nationwide.

Malnutrition rates were posted at 49.25%, of which 34.05% were classified as mildly underweight, 11.66% as moderately underweight, 1.43% as severely underweight and 3.60% as overweight.

Life expectancy for the region, based on the 1995 census, was 65.73 years old for males and 70.98 years old for females.

As of 1997, there were 62 hospitals in the region, of which 35 were government and 27 were private. Out of the 27 private hospitals, 20 were primary, 4 secondary and 3 tertiary. Out of the 35 government hospitals, 18 were primary, 14 were secondary and 3 were tertiary. There were 73 main health centers, 489 barangay health stations manned by 76 doctors, 147 nurses, 35 medical technologists, 45 dental aides, 52 dentists, 608 midwives and 137 sanitary inspectors. All of these were devolved to the local government units in accordance with the 1991 local Government code.

===Social welfare services===
In 1996, Caraga had 1,619 welfare facilities of which 1,238 were Day care Centers; 8 were Senior Citizens' Center; 3 were Productivity Skills capability Building for Disadvantaged Women (PSCBDW); and with 1 each were the child Learning and Resource Center, Women Center, Home for the Girls, Regional Rehabilitation Center for Youth, Lingap Center, Balay Silongan, Foster Home for Exploited Children And Women, and Halfway Home for Improved Mental Patients.

On the community-based services, only the PSCBDW is being managed by DSWD while the rest are managed by the LGUs.

===Housing===
The region had unique housing profile in 1990. While other areas complained of housing shortage, a significant number of houses, particularly in Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Norte were vacant. However, available statistics do not give the magnitude of substandard of units to be replaced and current housing backlog. Currently, the cities of Butuan and Surigao and other municipalities are not spared from housing problems, i.e. squatters bought by urbanization.

==Infrastructure==

===Roads and bridges===

Caraga Region has the first and only cable-stayed bridge in the entire Mindanao island, the Macapagal Bridge in Butuan connecting the Butuan Bypass Road over Agusan River.

The region is connected to the major centers of its neighboring regions by the [[Pan-Philippine Highway|Maharlika Highways]] that runs from the cities of Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Surigao. The provinces are interlinked with concrete roads, except for a very few parts in Surigao del Sur which is still partially concreted in select areas and is on its nearing completion. Total road length of the region runs to 7,515.596&nbsp;km. Road density was at 0.3988 as of 1995. There were 1,325.558&nbsp;km classified as national roads in the region and 1,289.774&nbsp;km of city and provincial roads. The total municipal road length for the region was 696.46&nbsp;km.

The region had bridges with the combined length of 23,775.49 meters linear. Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur had the longest bridge length 9,288.520 m linear and 7,853.4 m linear, respectively.

A project called 'East-West Lateral Road' forms part of the total regional connectivity between the Region XIII and [[Northern Mindanao]]. It foresees to promote development in different fields such as eco-tourism, agriculture, industry, and domestic trade. It will also provide an accessible route for the remote area settlers, thus uplifting their economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.build.gov.ph/Home/Project_Details/76?Agency=DPWH|title=East-West Lateral Road|access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref>

===Seaports and airports===
As the overland gateway to Visayas and Luzon, the region is accessible by sea through the baseport of Verano Port and Lipata Ferry Terminal in Surigao City that connects the neighboring province of [[Southern Leyte]]. Other terminal ports are in Dapa in Siargao, Surigao del Norte, San Jose in Dinagat Islands, Tandag and Bislig in Surigao del Sur and Nasipit Port in Agusan del Norte. Fast craft ferry services used to ply the Surigao City-[[Cebu]] City route every day. Private ports can also be found in the different municipalities and cities of the region, however, only three of these 42 ports are operational.

The region is serviced by commercial flights to and from Manila and Cebu through the airports of [[Butuan]], [[Surigao Airport|Surigao]] and [[Siargao]] in Surigao del Norte and [[Tandag Airport]] in Surigao del Sur. The [[Bislig Airport]] used to service commercial flights before its operations were suspended. Proposed airports in Agusan del Sur and Dinagat are being studied if viable for commercial operations. There are six other private owned airports in the region among them is the PHILNICO airport located in Nonoc Island in Surigao City. The ports and airports are supported by the road networks that connect the provinces within and outside the region.
