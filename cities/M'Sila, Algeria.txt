'''M'sila''' (also spelled '''Msila''') ({{langx|ar|المسيلة}});  is the capital of [[M'Sila Province]], [[Algeria]], and is co-extensive with '''M'sila District'''. It has a population of 132,975 as per the 2008 census.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/algeria/cities/|title=Algeria: Provinces & Major Cities - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information}}</ref>  M'sila University is also located in this city.

==History==
The city was founded {{circa|924}} under the name '''al-Muhammadiya''', named after the second [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliph]], [[al-Qa'im (Fatimid caliph)|al-Qa'im]], during the latter's campaign against the rebellious [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes of central Algeria. Meant to cement Fatimid control over the Hodna plain, the construction of the city was entrusted to [[Ali ibn Hamdun al-Andalusi]], who became its first governor. Much building material for the new city was taken from a nearby ruined Roman city (likely [[Lambaesis]] or [[Timgad]]).<ref>{{Das Reich des Mahdi | page = 242}}</ref>

M'sila was the location of the first village constructed as part of a government-run program to transition nomadic Algerians to sedentary life using local materials. The village, now complete, was dubbed Maader and consists of houses, public and trading areas, and a mosque. Today it is much more developed with many companies, business offices, religious centers and schools.
