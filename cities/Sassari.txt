=== Prehistory and ancient history===
{{unreferencedsect|date=August 2024}}
Although Sassari was founded in the [[early Middle Ages]], the surrounding area has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age, and throughout [[ancient history]], by the [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragics]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. <br />Many archaeological sites and ancient ruins are located inside or around the town: the prehistoric [[step pyramid]] of [[Monte d'Accoddi]], a large number of Nuraghes and [[Domus de Janas]] (Fairy Houses), the ruins of a Roman aqueduct, the ruins of a Roman villa discovered under San Nicholas Cathedral, and a portion of the ancient road that connected the Latin city of [[Porto Torres|Turris Libisonis]] with [[Cagliari|Caralis]]. In the locality of ''Fiume Santo'' is also found a fossil site where an ''[[Oreopithecus bambolii]]'', a prehistoric anthropomorphic primate, was discovered, dated at 8.5 million years.

[[File:Statuti Sassaresi XIV century 1a.png|thumb|The Sassari Republic's medieval statutes written in [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]]]
The origin of the city remains uncertain. Among the theses, according to folk tradition the first village was founded around the 9th–10th century AD by  the inhabitants of the ancient Roman port of ''Turris Libisonis'' (current [[Porto Torres]]), who sought refuge in the mainland to escape the [[Saracen]] attacks from the sea.

It developed from the merger of a number of separate villages, such as San Pietro di Silki, San Giacomo di Taniga, and San Giovanni di Bosove. The oldest mention of the village is in an 1131 document in the archive of the Monastery of St. Peter in Silki where is cited a man named ''Jordi de Sassaro'' (George of Sassari), a serf from the nearby village of Bosove. Sassari was sacked by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] in 1166.<ref name=Catholic/> Immigration continued until, in the early 13th century, it was the most populous city in the [[Giudicato of Torres]], and its last capital. After the assassination of [[Michele Zanche]], the latter's last ruler in 1275, Sassari became subject to the [[Republic of Pisa]] with a semi-independent status.

''The proclamation of the Republic of Sassari (The Council)'', [[Giuseppe Sciuti]], 1880, Sassari]]

In 1284, the Pisans were defeated by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] fleet at the [[Battle of Meloria]], and the city was able to free itself: it became the [[Republic of Sassari]], the first and only early independent renaissance city-state of Sardinia, with statutes of its own, allied to Genoa; the Genoese were pleased to see it thus withdrawn from Pisan control. Its statutes of 1316 are remarkable for the leniency of the penalties imposed when compared with the penal laws of the Middle Ages.<ref name=Catholic/>
[[File:Sassari - Cattedrale di San Nicola (05).JPG|thumb|right|The baroque façade of [[St. Nicholas]]]]
From 1323, the Republic of Sassari decided to side with the King of Aragon, in whose hands it remained for much of the following centuries, though the population revolted at least three times. The revolts ceased when King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] nominated the town as a Royal Burg, directly ruled by the King and free from feudal taxation, during a period in which it may have been the most populous city in Sardinia. Further attempts made by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] to conquer the city failed. In 1391 it was conquered by [[Brancaleone Doria]] and [[Marianus V of Arborea]], of the independent Sardinian [[Giudicato of Arborea]], of which it became the last capital.<ref name=Catholic/>

However, in 1420, the city was sold along with the remaining territory for 100,000 [[Florin (Aragonese coin)|florins]] to the Crown of Aragon, replaced by Spain after 1479 on the joining of the Aragonese and Castilian thrones. During the period of Aragonese and then Spanish domination the city was known as ''Sàsser'' in [[Catalan language]] and ''Saçer'' in old [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

===Renaissance===
{{unreferencedsect|date=August 2024}}
The city alternated years of crisis, featuring economic exploitation, the decrease of the [[maritime trade]], made unsafe by the daily raids of [[Saracen]] pirates, political corruption of its rulers, the sacking of Sassari in 1527 by the French, and two plagues in 1528 and 1652, with periods of cultural and economic prosperity. The [[Jesuits]] founded the first Sardinian [[university]] in Sassari in 1562. In the same year, the first [[printing press]] was introduced and the ideals of [[Renaissance humanism]] became more widely known. Several artists of the [[Mannerist]] and [[Flanders|Flemish]] schools practiced their art in the city.

[[File:Sassari carmona 2.jpg|thumb|Sassari view in 16th century]]
[[File:Ingresso a Sassari.jpg|thumb|[[Giovanni Maria Angioy]], the Emissary of the [[List of viceroys of Sardinia|Viceroy]] enters Sassari (1795).]]
After the end of the Spanish period following the European wars of the early 18th century, the brief period of [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] rule (1708–1717) was succeeded by domination by the Piedmontese, who then took over the title of [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1720–1861). In 1795 an anti-feudal uprising broke out in the town, led by the Emissary of the [[List of viceroys of Sardinia|Viceroy]] [[Giovanni Maria Angioy]], a Sardinian civil servant, who later fought unsuccessfully against the [[house of Savoy]]. The city was occupied by troops at the time.  The dynasty of the Piedmontese King of Sardinia went on to the monarchs of Italy. Sassari, along with the rest of Italy, became part of the newly created [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].

At the end of the 18th century, the [[University of Sassari|university]]  was restored. In 1836, after six hundred years, the [[city wall|medieval walls]] were partially demolished, allowing the town to expand. New urban plans were developed, on the model of the capital of the new regime ([[Turin]]), with geometric streets and squares.

Sassari became an important industrial center. In the 19th century, it was the second most important town in what was to become the future Italy for the production of [[leather]], and in 1848 the Sassarese entrepreneur [[Giovanni Antonio Sanna]] gained control of the mine at [[Montevecchio]], becoming the third richest man in the new Kingdom of Italy. The first railway was opened in 1872.

In 1877, the old [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] castle was demolished, and on the site the "Caserma La Marmora" was built, where the headquarters of "[[Sassari Mechanized Brigade|Brigata Sassari]]" is still located. Founded in 1915, it still consists mainly of Sardinian soldiers.

At the end of the 19th century, new urban developments grew on Cappuccini Hill and to the south of the city,  architecturally dominated by [[Eclecticism]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] styles, which created a movement towards the hybrid experimentation of new local architectural styles, known as the ''Sassarese Liberty''.

During the Fascist dictatorship, the town had over fifty thousand inhabitants and new neighbourhoods were built, the most important of these being Monte Rosello and Porcellana, typical examples of [[Fascist architecture|Rationalist Architecture]]. On the other hand, the newspaper ''[[La Nuova Sardegna]]'', considered subversive, was closed down. During the [[Second World War]] three Allied attempts to bomb the town failed: only the railway station was damaged, and there was only one casualty.

The 8th Stage of the [[2023 Giro Donne]] finished at Salassa on 8 July.{{Historical populations|1861|25594|1871|32315|1881|34540|1901|37746|1911|43028|1921|43792|1931|51283|1936|54926|1951|69449|1961|89107|1971|106175|1981|118631|1991|122339|2001|120729|2011|123782|2021|122159|type=|footnote=Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]}}

==Geography==
Sassari is located in north-western Sardinia, at {{convert|225|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].  The area rises up on a wide [[karst]]ic plateau that slopes gently down towards the Gulf of [[Asinara]] and the [[Nurra]] plain. The city is surrounded by a [[green belt]] of thousands of hectares of [[olive]] [[plantation]]s, which from the 19th century have partly replaced the mixed woodlands of [[oak]] and other Mediterranean trees as well as the [[maquis shrubland]]. The thinly populated Nurra Plain, located to the west, occupies the main part of the region of Sassari, while the [[urban agglomeration]], with a population of about 275,000 inhabitants, is located to the south east. The abundance of water, with about 400 springs and [[artesian wells]], has made for much development of [[horticulture]] over the centuries.

== Culture ==
[[File:Université de Sassari.JPG|thumb|right|University of Sassari]]

===Language===
[[File:Maps of Corsican Dialects.svg|thumb|right|The Sassarese compared to Corsican dialects]]
{{see also|Sassarese language}}
{{Unreferencedsect|date=September 2024}}
[[Sassarese]] (''Sassaresu'' or ''Turritanu'') is much closer to [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Tuscan language]] than it is to [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], although this fact has caused some political controversy. It originated as a [[lingua franca]] between the first [[Sardinians]], [[Corsicans]], [[Toscana|Tuscans]] and [[Liguria]]n people, during the period of the [[maritime republics]]. The original [[Tuscan language|Tuscan structure]] was influenced by the [[Logudorese dialect|Sardinian Logudorese]] spoken in the area, with a strong influence that can be felt in its phonetics and vocabulary, and by [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in vocabulary.

Sassarese is spoken in Sassari and its immediate area by approximately 120,000 people out a total population of 175,000 inhabitants; it is also the language of the north-west of Sardinia, including [[Stintino]], [[Sorso]] and [[Porto Torres]]; in the mid-northern areas of Sardinia, its ''Castellanesi'' dialects of [[Castelsardo]], [[Tergu]] and [[Sedini]] are more similar to the [[Gallurese]].
