'''Maringá''' ({{IPA|pt|mɐɾĩˈɡa}}) is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in southern Brazil founded on 10 May 1947 as a planned urban area. It is the third largest city in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], with 385,753 inhabitants in the city proper, and 764,906 in the metropolitan area ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] 2013). Located in northwestern Paraná, and crossed by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], it is a regional centre for commerce, services, agro-industries, and universities, including the [[State University of Maringá]].

==History==
===Toponymy===
Maringá takes its name from a song by [[Joubert de Carvalho]] in honour of his great love, Maria do Ingá, later shortened to Maringá. As a result, the city is nicknamed "Song City".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brol.com/brazil-destinations/maringa-parana/|title=Maringa, Parana - brol.com|website=Brol.com|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> At the time the settlement was established, the song was very popular in the media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lyricalbrazil.com/2013/11/19/maringa/|title=Maringá|website=Lyricalbrazil.com|date=19 November 2013|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref>

===Settlement===
In 1925, the Northern Paraná Land Company was established in [[London]], England and was responsible for the management of more than {{convert|500000|acre|km2}} in the northern part of the State, which today contains some of the largest cities in Paraná.

The region's fertile land encouraged [[São Paulo]] colonists to move in and acquire new areas for production of coffee beans, an important product for exportation.
The northern region of Paraná encloses nearly 100 thousand km<sup>2</sup>. It is watered by the Rivers Paranapanema, Paraná, Ivaí and Piquiri.
The urban project requested by the British Company Improvements North of the Paraná (Melhoramentos Co.) and elaborated by the city planner Jorge Macedo Vieira, defined the outlines of the new city. Maringá received the status of municipality on 14 November 1951.

The company, worried about deforestation proceeding from the occupation foreseen in the urbanistics projects, reserved three great ecological areas within the urban limits: the Forest Horto, the Park of the Ingá and Forest II and the city was planned as a "[[garden city movement|garden city]]" from the beginning.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Macedo|first=Joseli|title=Maringá: A British Garden City in the tropics|journal=Cities|date=August 2011|volume=28|issue=4|pages=347–359|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2010.11.003 }}</ref>
==Demography==
[[File:By_robertoserviço_-_panoramio_-_robertografiteiro_(4).jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Maringá]], the city's most famous landmark, was completed in 1972. At {{convert|124|m}}, it is the tallest church building in South America.]]

===Ethnicity===
The region of Maringá has been greatly influenced by Japanese immigrants, alongside Italian and German immigrants. Portuguese descendants also have a considerable presence in the city. Other prevalent ethnic groups are African and Amerindian descendants, Poles, Spaniards, Ukrainians, Arabs, Jews, Russians, and a small group of British descendants.<ref name="observatoriodasmetropoles.ufrj.br">{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoriodasmetropoles.ufrj.br/como_anda/como_anda_RM_maringa.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304083646/http://www.observatoriodasmetropoles.ufrj.br/como_anda/como_anda_RM_maringa.pdf |archive-date=2011-03-04 }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Maringa 02 2016 1512.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of Maringá.]]

===Climate===
Maringá experiences a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af'', according to [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]) bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''). It has well distributed rainfall, where the average temperature of the coldest month is around 17.8&nbsp;°C (64&nbsp;°F) and average annual temperatures around 21.95&nbsp;°C (71.51&nbsp;°F).
Because of its location, situated in southern Brazil and crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn, the region of Maringá is influenced by several macro-climatic factors caused by migration of air masses from the Atlantic Ocean and from the Tropical zone.
In the winter the infiltration of cold air from the polar front is relatively common, and frosts can occur.

===Flora===
[[Image:Ipe amarelo uem.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''[[Handroanthus serratifolius]]'']]

[[Image:Mga minha.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ingá Lake]]

Maringá has a high rate of concentration of green area per capita, there are {{convert|90|acre|m2}} of native forest on 17 preserved areas.

The city preserves within its limits large areas of native forest in the Horto Florestal, Parque dos Pioneiros (Bosque II) and Parque do Inga, this being open to the public. It also includes smaller preserved areas as the Parque do Cinquentenário, private areas and so on.

Throughout the year it is possible to observe its tree-lined streets that produce a good air to breathe, but especially in the passage from winter to spring, many trees explode in flowers.

Maringá has one of the highest concentration rates of green area, {{cvt|26.65|m2}} per inhabitant, 90 bushels of native forest in 17 forests.

===Pollution===
Even with the normal problems of urban centers, Maringá preserves its reputation as a green city, ecologically well cared for. Its origin had planning, urban planning - forest reserves, central construction site, wide avenues, several species of trees that follow a Master Plan

Maringá's largest (76,74%), followed by industrial (22,29%) and farming (0,97%). Within industry, the food-processing, chemical and textile sectors predominate.

===Agriculture===
The agriculture still is fundamental for Maringá, although its importance has declined in recent years. Farming is diversified, and besides coffee, today are produced corn, wheat, cotton, ramie, beans, peanuts, rice, sugar cane, and especially soybeans.
