==Etymology==
The name of the region is an acronym of its five component provinces: [[Cavite|'''Ca'''vite]], [[Laguna (province)|'''La'''guna]], [[Batangas|'''Ba'''tangas]], [[Rizal (province)|'''R'''izal]] and [[Quezon (province)|Que'''zon''']].

==History==
On June 5, 1901, a convention was called on whether or not the province of [[Manila]] should annex the [[Morong (district)|district of Morong]], which was found to be unable to be self-sufficient as a province. Eventually, on June 11, ''Act No. 137'' of the [[First Philippine Commission]] abolished Morong and created a new province, named after the Philippines' national hero, Jose Rizal, who, coincidentally, was a native of Laguna. The new province comprised 29 municipalities, 17 from Manila and 12 from Morong. In 1902, [[Macario Sakay]], a veteran [[Katipunan]] member, established the [[Tagalog Republic]] in the mountains of Rizal. Ultimately, Sakay's Tagalog Republic ended in 1906 when he and his men were betrayed under the guise of holding a national assembly aimed at the self-determination of the Filipino people.<ref>[http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/398993/mark-sakay-vilified-hero-our-war-americaPhilippine Star: The mark of Sakay: The vilified hero of our war with America], retrieved March 9, 2013</ref>

On September 7, 1946, the [[Third Philippine Republic]] enacted ''Republic Act No. 14'', which renamed the province of Tayabas to ''Quezon'', in honor of [[Manuel Quezon]],<ref name="RA14">{{cite act |date=September 7, 1946 |title=An Act to Change the Name of the Province of Tayabas to Quezon |type=Republic Act |number=14 |url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/1_republicacts.php?id=14 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> the second [[President of the Philippines]] and elected governor of Tayabas in 1906 and congressman of 1st district of Tayabas in 1907 and a native of [[Baler, Aurora|Baler]] (now part of [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]]), formerly one of the towns of Quezon Province.

In 1979, Aurora formally became a province independent of Quezon and was also included in Region IV.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

On May 17, 2002, President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] signed ''Executive Order No. 103'', which reorganized the Southern Tagalog region.

The region is the 12th largest region in the Philippines, with an area of {{convert|16873.31|km2|abbr=on}}. The region itself is relatively flat, but also consists of coastal areas and highlands.<ref name="DENR">{{Cite web |title=CALABARZON Region and Socio-Economic Profile |url=http://calabarzon.denr.gov.ph/index.php/about-us/regional-profile/reg-profile-physical-socio-eco |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518144024/http://calabarzon.denr.gov.ph/index.php/about-us/regional-profile/reg-profile-physical-socio-eco |archive-date=May 18, 2017 |access-date=April 12, 2017 |publisher=Department of Environment and Natural Resources}}</ref> It is bordered by [[Manila Bay]] in the west, [[Metro Manila]], [[Bulacan]], and [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] in the north, [[Lamon Bay]] and [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] in the east, and the [[Isla Verde Passage]] in the south. Each province in the region is composed of different environments, ranging from low coastal areas to rugged mountainous ones.

Cavite is characterized by rolling hinterlands punctured by hills, with a shoreline bordering [[Manila Bay]] and a rugged portion bordering Batangas near [[Mount Pico de Loro]]. [[Tagaytay Ridge|Tagaytay]] is located in Cavite, bordering [[Alfonso, Cavite|Alfonso]], [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]], [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]]. [[Mount Sungay]] is the highest peak in the province and can be found in Tagaytay. There are nine islands in Cavite, most notable of which is the island of [[Corregidor]]. Historically a site of great strategic importance, Corregidor is found at the mouth of Manila Bay and is under the jurisdiction of [[Cavite City]].

Laguna has rugged terrain, with narrow plains near the shores of [[Laguna de Bay]] and mountainous ranges further inland. Laguna de Bay is the largest lake in the Philippines, and is named after the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]]. Laguna is also home to [[Mount Makiling]], a [[dormant volcano]] near [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] reputed for its mystical properties. There are also a lot of [[hot spring]]s near the Makiling area, especially in [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]]. Another famous landmark in Laguna are the [[Pagsanjan Falls]], in [[Cavinti, Laguna|Cavinti]]. The water from the Pagsanjan Falls comes from the [[Bumbungan River]]. [[Mount Banahaw]] borders Laguna and Quezon, and is similarly considered to be a [[Sacred mountains|holy mountain]] like Makiling.

[[File:Taal Volcano aerial 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the Taal Volcano]]
The Batangas area is mostly elevated, with small low flat lands and scattered mountain areas. Batangas is also home to the [[Taal Volcano]], a [[complex volcano]] and one of the 16 [[Decade Volcanoes]]. The Taal Volcano is situated within [[Taal Lake]], making Taal a third-order island, and possibly one of the largest in the world. Other islands in Batangas are [[Verde Island]], near the Isla Verde Passage, and [[Fortune Island (Philippines)|Fortune Island]] in [[Nasugbu, Batangas|Nasugbu]]. Batangas borders Cavite via Mount Pico de Loro, known for the views that could be found in its summit. [[Mount Macolod]] and [[Mount Batulao]] can also be found in Batangas.

Rizal is situated north of Laguna de Bay, and consists of a mixture of valleys and mountain ranges, with flat low-lying areas in the western portion of the province near Manila. The eastern portion of Rizal has hills and ridges which form part of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] range. [[Talim Island]], the largest island in Laguna de Bay, is under the jurisdiction of the province of Rizal.

Quezon province is mountainous, with few plains and swamps, and the tail-end of the Sierra Madre running through it. Quezon is a narrow province, with the [[Tayabas Isthmus]] comprising the southern part of the province and connecting it to the [[Bicol Peninsula]]. The southern part also consists of the [[Bondoc Peninsula]], sandwiched between the [[Tayabas Bay]] and [[Ragay Gulf]]. 
{{Further|Mount Maburgos}}

The largest islands in Quezon are the [[Alabat Island|Alabat]] and [[Polillo Island|Polillo]] islands, which are both located in [[Lamon Bay]], connecting to [[Calauag Bay]] of the town of [[Calauag]]. Laguna shares a border with Quezon via Mount Banahaw.

Calabarzon is also home to a sizable number of people with [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry on account of Chinese immigration and Spanish colonization, respectively. Because of the large majority of Tagalog natives, the majority of people living in Calabarzon speak the Tagalog language. [[Filipino language|Filipino]], being a version of Tagalog, is predominant in the region, which is spoken as a lingua franca of Tagalog speakers of different dialects.

==Economy==
{{Stack|float=left|{{PH poverty incidence}}}}
Calabarzon is the second largest contributor to the national GDP, accounting for 17% of the gross domestic product. The region boasts a 2.1% inflation rate, lower than the national average of 3%. The region has a 9.2% unemployment rate which is higher than the national average of 7%. Calabarzon, much like the rest of the country, is caught in the middle of being an industrial and an agricultural economy.

Due to the region's proximity to [[Metro Manila]], a large amount of urbanization has taken place over the years. Cavite and Laguna in particular are sites of manufacturing and high-tech industries, with companies like [[Intel]] and [[Panasonic]] setting up plants in the region. Santa Rosa, Laguna, is home to a host of semi-conductor and automotive companies such as [[Amkor]] and [[Toyota]], while [[General Trias]] is home to Cavite's largest economic development zone, the PEC Industrial Park.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The region still has a large agricultural base. As of 2002, the region had 282,700 farms, covering {{convert|588500|ha}}, or 36.3% of the region's total land area.<ref>[https://www.census.gov.ph/content/review-agriculture-sector-calabarzon A Review of the Agriculture Sector in CALABARZON] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410172726/http://www.census.gov.ph/content/review-agriculture-sector-calabarzon |date=April 10, 2016 }} Philippine Statistics Authority, Retrieved March 11, 2013</ref> Cavite alone has almost {{convert|70500|ha}} of agricultural land. Laguna is home to the [[International Rice Research Institute]], which can be found within the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]], whose main goal is to find sustainable ways to help rice farmers. Batangas, meanwhile, is home to a large pineapple and coconut industry, which is used to make [[barong tagalog]]s and [[lambanog]]. Quezon is the country's leader in coconut products such as [[coconut oil]] and [[copra]]. Quezon's towns such as [[Tayabas City]], [[Mauban]] and [[Infanta, Quezon|Infanta]] are also known producers of commercialized native [[liqueur]]s such as [[Arrack#Philippines|lambanog]] and tuba. Rizal is known for its piggeries. Region IV-A's agricultural base, however, is slowly decreasing. Due to their proximity to large bodies of water, Laguna and Batangas also have sizable fishing industries. [[Taal Lake]] is a large source of fresh water fishes for the country.

Local festivals include the Taytsinoy Festival, Mayohan Festival, Pa'yas Festival Hagisan Festival, Baliskog Festival, Angel Festival, Aguyod Festival and the Turumba Festival every Holy Week.

[[Lucban]] is most famous for its annual [[Pahiyas Festival]] or locally known as Pahiyas, an event not only visited by local tourists but also by international tourists as well. Devotees and pilgrims also visit Lucban's [[Kamay ni Hesus Healing Church (Lucban)|Kamay ni Hesus Shrine]], which has a 50-foot statue of the Ascending Christ on top of a hill.<ref name="Mallari2018">{{cite news |first=Delfin Jr. |last=Mallari |title=3 million devotees, pilgrims visit Kamay ni Hesus Shrine in Lucban |date=March 31, 2018 |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/979313/3-million-devotees-pilgrims-visit-kamay-ni-hesus-shrine-in-lucban |url-status=live |work=[[Inquirer Group of Companies#Inquirer.net|Inquirer.net]] |publisher=Inquirer Interactive Inc. |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230624154751/https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/979313/3-million-devotees-pilgrims-visit-kamay-ni-hesus-shrine-in-lucban |archive-date=June 24, 2023 |access-date=June 25, 2023 |quote=[...] 50-foot concrete icon of the Risen Christ at the summit of the hill [...]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Batangas is also famous for its scenic beaches in [[Nasugbu, Batangas|Nasugbu]] and [[Calatagan, Batangas|Calatagan]].

==Infrastructure==
===Roads and bridges===
Being an industrialized region, Calabarzon is dotted with expressways and highways to serve the people traveling to factories and industries, as well as to accommodate traffic that comes to and from Metro Manila, as it is located just east and south of the region. The [[Pan-Philippine Highway]] is an important road that crosses through Laguna, Cavite, Batangas, and Quezon, serving as a gateway to the southern parts of Luzon.

The [[South Luzon Expressway]] and [[Southern Tagalog Arterial Road]] link the port of Batangas to Metro Manila, while the [[Cavite–Laguna Expressway]] and [[Manila–Cavite Expressway]] (also known as CAVITEX) seamlessly link industrial towns and cities that dot around Cavite and Laguna. All the aforementioned expressways also help accommodate the inter-modal traffic between Calabarzon and Metro Manila, serving as a faster, more viable alternative compared to primary highways that directly cross municipal and city centers.

The Laguna Lake Highway, a joint project of DPWH NCR and Region IV-A, is the widening/rehabilitation at Taytay, Rizal segment, a 3.34-kilometer road.

Currently, there are two more bridges being built - Barkadahan Bridge and Napindan Bridge - which will provide additional 2 lanes crossing over Manggahan Floodway and Pasig River, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Laguna Lake Highway |url=http://www.build.gov.ph/Home/Project_Details/74?Agency=DPWH |access-date=August 7, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220620030831/http://build.gov.ph/Home/Project_Details/74?Agency=DPWH |url-status=dead }}</ref>
