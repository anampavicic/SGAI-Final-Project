'''Gorontalo''' ([[Gorontalo language|Gorontaloan]]: ''Hulontalo'') is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]] on the island of [[Sulawesi]]. Located on the [[Minahasa Peninsula]], Gorontalo was formerly part of the province of [[North Sulawesi]] until its inauguration as a separate province on 5 December 2000. The province is bordered by the provinces of [[North Sulawesi]] to the east and [[Central Sulawesi]] to the west, as well sharing a maritime border with the [[Philippines]] in the [[Sulawesi Sea]] to the north, and a coastline on the [[Gulf of Tomini]] to the south.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gorontalo|first1=Pemprov|title=HUT Provinsi Gorontalo|url=https://gorontaloprov.go.id/informasi/berita/prov-gorontalo/5-desember-hut-provinsi-gorontalo|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-date=27 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527135416/https://gorontaloprov.go.id/informasi/berita/prov-gorontalo/5-desember-hut-provinsi-gorontalo|url-status=dead}}</ref> The provincial capital, as well as the main gateway to the province and its most populated city, is [[Gorontalo (city)|Gorontalo]] (also often called Hulontalo). The size is comparable to [[Vanuatu]].

The province covers a total land area of {{convert|12,025.15|km2}} and had a population of 1,040,164 at the 2010 Census,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 1,171,681 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,213,180 (comprising 611,780 males and 601,400 females), resulting in a population density of {{convert|100.887|PD/km2}}.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2023, ''Provinsi Gorontalo Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.75)</ref>

The province is known by the nicknames "Porch of [[Medina]]" ({{langx|id|Bumi Serambi Madinah}}), an allusion to the cradle of Islamic civilisation used because the pre-colonial kingdoms of Gorontalo applied Islamic law as a basis for implementing the law, in the fields of government, society and the courts,<ref>Perdana, D.

== Etymology ==
{{also|Gorontalo people#Etymology}}
The word ''Gorontalo'' comes from the word ''Hulontalo'' in the Gorontalo language. ''Hulontalo'' is derived from the word ''Hulontalangi'', a name of one of the Kingdoms in Gorontalo. In addition, there are several historical records regarding the origin of the name Gorontalo, including:<ref>Badudu, Y., 1982. Morfologi Bahasa Gorontalo. Djambatan.</ref>

#Gorontalo comes from the word "Hulontalangi", which means "Valley of the Noble". Hulontalangi comes from two syllables, namely "Huluntu" which means "Valley" and "Langi" which means "Noble".
#Gorontalo comes from the word "Hulontalangi", which means "Inundated Land". The word "Hulontalangi" in other translations comes from two syllables, namely "Huntu" which means "Piles of Soils" or "Mainland", and "Langi-Langi" which means "Flooded". Then the word "Hulontalangi" can also be interpreted as "Flooded Land" according to the story of the people of Gorontalo.
#Gorontalo comes from the word "Huidu Totolu", which means "Three Mountains". If traced its history, there are three ancient mountains on the Gorontalo peninsula, namely Mount Malenggalila, Mount Tilonggabila (changed to Tilongkabila) and another Mountain which is not named.
#Gorontalo comes from the word "Pogulatalo", which means "Place of Waiting". The word "Pogulatalo" gradually changed in the words of the community to "Hulatalo"
#Gorontalo comes from the word "Hulontalo". However, due to difficulties in pronunciation, the Dutch colonizers referred to "Hulontalo" as "Gorontalo".

Gorontalo people sometime refer themselves as ''Hulandalo'' or ''Hulantalo'', a well-known term in Gorontalo and North Sulawesi, which usually refers to the region of Gorontalo or the native people from Gorontalo.

== History ==
Historically, Gorontalo has been the centre for the spread of [[Islam]] in Eastern Indonesia, dating back to the pre-colonial era. The province also was the seat of many independent Gorontaloan kingdoms. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] arrived in the beginning of the 17th century, subjugating the local kingdoms and finally annexed the area into the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Gorontalo was briefly occupied by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]], before finally becoming part of the independent Republic of Indonesia. 

Gorontalo was incorporated into the province of North Sulawesi, but after the [[Fall of Suharto]], the government decided to create a new province, owing to the cultural and religious differences to the Christian-majority province of North Sulawesi and also as part of the country's decentralization program. Hence, the new province was created on 5 December 2000.

Compared to other provinces of Indonesia, Gorontalo is one of the least developed provinces. As of 2017, Gorontalo scores 0.670 in [[Human Development Index]], one of the lowest in Indonesia. It ranks 28th out of the 34 provinces. Compared to the neighbouring provinces such as North Sulawesi, Gorontalo's infrastructure is very poorly developed. The province has often suffered from electricity crises as well as water shortages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20150223165155-85-34205/provinsi-gorontalo-krisis-listrik|title=Provinsi Gorontalo Krisis Listrik|last=Duta|first=Diemas Kresna|work=ekonomi|access-date=16 November 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.beritasatu.com/nasional/269040-68-desa-di-gorontalo-krisis-air-bersih-dan-sanitasi.html|title=68 Desa di Gorontalo Krisis Air Bersih dan Sanitasi|work=beritasatu.com|access-date=16 November 2018|language=id}}</ref> Nevertheless, the government is currently attempting to improve Gorontalo's infrastructure, with construction projects such as the Gorontalo Outer Ring Road, Randangan Dam and the Anggrek Power Plant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wartaekonomi.co.id/read188004/jokowi-akan-resmikan-sejumlah-infrastruktur-di-gorontalo.html|title=Jokowi Akan Resmikan Sejumlah Infrastruktur di Gorontalo|date=20 July 2018|work=Warta Ekonomi|access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Pre-Colonial era ===
The peninsula which includes Gorontalo has had some type of human civilization since approximately 1300 years ago.{{clarify|date=April 2019}} Historical records show a Kingdom of [[Suwawa]] as existing in 8th century CE.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Suwawa|first1=Kerajaan|title=suwawa kingdom|url=http://www.gimonca.com/sejarah/sejarah01.shtml|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This is reinforced by the discovery of the tomb of their king, Moluadu, on the banks of the river Bulawa along with his wife and child.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bahasa Bonda dan Kubur Keramat|date=7 June 2012|url=https://gorontaloholiday.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/bahasa-bonda-bahasa-tertua-di-gorontalo-yang-terancam-punah/|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>

However, Gorontalo Peninsula did not just have historical records on the inscription King ancient tombs, but it also has prehistoric sites. Oluhuta sites, is a prehistoric site and has a prehistoric tomb in it. This may be evidence that Gorontalo has had very ancient civilization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Situs Oluhuta|date=15 February 2016 |url=http://regional.kompas.com/read/2016/02/15/13102291/Ditemukan.Kerangka.Manusia.Berumur.700.Tahun.di.Gorontalo|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the city of Gorontalo is one of the oldest cities on Sulawesi in addition to the city of [[Makassar]] and [[Manado]]. It is estimated, Gorontalo has been around since approximately 400 years ago or around the 1500s in the 16th century. Previously Gorontalo City became one of the centers of Islamic religion in Eastern Indonesia, in addition to Ternate (now part of North Maluku Province).<ref>{{cite news|title=Kota Tua Gorontalo|url=http://www.kompasiana.com/300387helman/kota-gorontalo-entrepreneur-wisata-dan-historis_5500af82a333111e73511b3e|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>

Along with the spread of the religion, Gorontalo city eventually became the centre of education and commerce for the surrounding regions such as [[Bolaang Mongondow Regency|Bolaang Mongondow]] ([[North Sulawesi]]), [[Buol Regency|Buol]], [[Luwuk]], [[Banggai fruit dove|Banggai]], [[Donggala Regency|Donggala]] ([[Central Sulawesi]]) and even further towards [[Southeast Sulawesi]]. This is because of its strategic location, its position facing directly into the [[Gulf of Tomini]] (south) and the [[Celebes Sea|Sulawesi Sea]] (north).

Before the colonial period Gorontalo was governed under customary law. Kingdoms were united in a bond of kinship called "Pohala'a". According to Haga (1931) there are five pohala'a Gorontalo area:<ref>{{cite web|title=Sejarah Gorontalo|url=http://www.pn-gorontalo.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=34|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>
*Pohala'a Gorontalo
*Pohala'a Limboto
*Pohala'a Suwawa
*Pohala'a Bolango then be Pohala'a Boalemo
*Pohala'a Atinggola

Based on the classification made by the Mr. C. Vollenhoven, the Gorontalo peninsula was included among the 19 indigenous areas in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daerah Adat Indonesia|url=http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbgorontalo/2014/05/09/sejarah-gorontalo_indonesia/|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075922/http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbgorontalo/2014/05/09/sejarah-gorontalo_indonesia/|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Between religion and customs in Gorontalo was fused with the term "Adat bersendikan Syara 'and Syara' bersendikan Kitabullah". Pohalaa Gorontalo is the most prominent among the five Pohalaa. That is why Gorontalo is more widely known.

=== Colonial era ===
Westerners began arriving in the Indonesian archipelago starting in the 16th century because of interest in spices from Indonesia, especially spices from the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku islands]]. The first Westerners to come to Indonesia were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], who sailed from [[Malacca City|Malacca]] to [[Gresik Regency|Gresik]] in [[East Java]] and then to the Moluccas, where spices were collected. Then followed the [[Spaniards]], who arrived in 1521 with two ships through the [[Philippines]], [[Borneo]], [[Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]], and [[Jailolo (town)|Jailolo]], until they sailed to Maluku until 1534.

Then the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] came to Indonesia and arrived in Banten in 1596, which was also a place for trading spices from the surrounding area. In 1607, the Dutch visited the [[Minahasa Peninsula]], with the approval of the Sultan of Ternate. As the peninsula at that time was part of the [[Sultanate of Ternate]], the Dutch were assigned by the Sultan to order all Ternate people who were in [[Manado]] to return to Ternate. This was done to make it easier for the Dutch to repulse Spain in Manado who came to North Sulawesi through the Philippines. In 1617, the [[Spaniards]] tried to spread [[Catholicism]] to the local people around [[Lake Tondano]] by force, but they were repulsed by the local community. The local chief requested the Dutch for help, and the Spaniards was repulsed from the area.

Since then, in North Sulawesi, the Dutch began to establish its hegemony, then after the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) governor in Ternate, Robertus Padtbrugge, traveled across North Sulawesi to Kwandang to make a contractual decision in 1678. The Gorontaloan and Limbotoan localities could do nothing when the Ternate Sultanate handed over Gorontalo and Limboto regions to the VOC.

Gorontalo was important to the VOC because it contained food ingredients such as rice, chocolate and coconut, besides that in the mountains there are also gold mines, such as in the areas of Samalata, Marisa, Bonepantai, and Bintauna. Seeing these conditions, the VOC established a trading post, through which the trade offices between the Dutch government and Gorontaloan kingdoms were officially started.

Subsequent developments, the political transition of the VOC to the [[Dutch East Indies]] at the turn of the 18th century to the 19th century was marked by VOC bankruptcy caused by various factors, such as accounting fraud, corruption, weak employee capabilities, monopoly systems, and systems forced which brought about the moral deterioration of the rulers and the suffering of the population.

Entering the 19th century as the transition of the government process of centralization of government administration from the central level to the village level was inevitable for the Dutch colonies, especially Gorontalo.

[[File:Monumen Nani Wartabone.JPG|thumb|upright|A monument of [[Nani Wartabone]], a Gorontaloan national hero who resisted both the Dutch and the Japanese.]]

=== Japanese Occupation and Independence ===
The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupied Gorontalo during [[World War II]], ending three centuries of Dutch colonial rule. Gorontalo was subjected to air bombing as well as naval shelling by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] over the course of the war, resulting in severe civilian casualties.

Prior to the onset of [[Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], [[Nani Wartabone]] headed a Gorontalan Independence Movement, declaring itself sovereign on 23 January 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gorontaloprov.go.id/profil/sejarah|title=Sejarah Gorontalo|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> For approximately two years Gorontalo was effectively a self-governing region. This was a milestone in the struggle for independence and inspired similar efforts both on [[Celebes]] and across the Indonesian archipelago. However, this was brutally opposed by the Japanese, and the [[Kenpeitai]] arrested and tortured many pro-Independence advocate, including Wartabone himself. Wartabone was eventually recognized by the [[Indonesian government]] as a [[National Hero of Indonesia]]. Today, he is buried in his hometown of Suwawa, in the eastern part of the province.

After the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the Japanese handed the area to the local pro-Independence militia. However, the Dutch returned to Gorontalo to assume control, resulting in an inevitable [[Indonesian National Revolution|war]] between the Dutch forces and the Indonesian Republicans. After the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] between the Dutch and the Indonesian, Gorontalo was incorporated into the [[State of East Indonesia]], a state of the [[United States of Indonesia]]. In 1950, Gorontalo became part of the province of [[North Sulawesi]] in a now unitary Republic of Indonesia.

In 1957, chaos and lack of attention by the central government in [[Jakarta]] resulted in a rebellion by [[Permesta]] which was based in Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi. However, Gorontalo was not much affected by the rebellion, as the locals still supported the central government. The rebellion was crushed in 1960 after the government assaulted and captured Manado.

In 2000, Gorontalo City and two regencies, with their Muslim-majority communities, were spun off from North Sulawesi into a separate province with Gorontalo as the provincial seat.

==Geography==
[[File:Gorontalo-Kwandangarea-Indonesia-cloudyday.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kwandang]] area.]]
Gorontalo lies on the northern peninsula of [[Sulawesi]], also known as the [[Minahasa Peninsula]]. The province has an elongated shape area, stretching from west to east almost horizontally on a map, with a total area of {{convert|12025.15|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="gorontalogeo">{{cite web |url=http://www.gorontaloprov.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=823&Itemid=51| access-date=27 August 2007| title=Geographical Condition |language=id |work=Gorontalo ~ Provinsi Agropolitan |publisher=Provincial Government of Gorontalo |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716004107/http://www.gorontaloprov.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=823&Itemid=51 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 16 July 2007}}</ref> To the north and the south of the province lies the [[Sulawesi Sea]] and the Gulf of Gorontalo or known as [[Gulf of Tomini]], respectively. Prior to 2000, Gorontalo province was part of [[North Sulawesi]] province which lies on the eastern border. The western border of the province is [[Central Sulawesi]] province.<ref>{{cite web|title=Batas Provinsi Gorontalo|url=http://bonebolangokab.go.id/web/berita-kemendagri-tetapkan-tapal-batas-gorontalosulut-di-gunung-gambuta.html|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-date=1 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801092445/http://www.bonebolangokab.go.id/web/berita-kemendagri-tetapkan-tapal-batas-gorontalosulut-di-gunung-gambuta.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Governor Office of Gorontalo Province.JPG|thumb|Governor's office of Gorontalo Province (2010).]]
The province is divided into five [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] ({{langx|id|kabupaten}}) and only one [[Cities of Indonesia|city]] ({{langx|id|kota}}). When the province was established in 2000, there were only two regencies ('''Gorontalo Regency''' and '''Boalemo Regency''') and the city in the province. Splitting of regencies occurred on 25 February 2003 (when '''Pohuwato Regency''' was created from the western part of Boalemo Regency (itself only created on 4 October 1999 from the western part of Gorontalo Regency), and '''Bone Bolango Regency''' was created from the eastern part of Gorontalo Regency) and on 2 January 2007 (when '''North Gorontalo Regency''' was created from the northern part of Gorontalo Regency). In 2023, Gorontalo Province consisted of 77 districts (''kecamatan'') comprising 734 villages (rural ''desa'' and urban ''kelurahan''). <br />As of 2024, the list of regencies and cities in Gorontalo province is given in the table below with their areas and their populations at the 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2023, ''Provinsi Gorontalo Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.75)</ref>
