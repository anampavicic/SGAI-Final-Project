'''Kota Bharu''' ([[Kelantanese]]: ''Koto Baru''; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{Script/Arabic|كوتبهارو}}), colloquially referred to as '''KB''', is a town in [[Malaysia]] that serves as the state capital and royal seat of [[Kelantan]]. It is situated in the northeastern part of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and lies near the mouth of the [[Kelantan River]].

The town is home to many [[religious building]]s, various museums, the unique architecture of the old royal palaces (still occupied by the [[Sultan of Kelantan|sultan]] and [[sultana (title)|sultanah]] and off-limits to visitors but viewable from outside) and former royal buildings (which can be visited). It is served by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]]'s [[KTM East Coast Line|East Coast Line]] at the nearby Wakaf Bharu Terminal Station, in the town of [[Wakaf Bharu]] across the Kelantan River and [[Sultan Ismail Petra Airport]], located in [[Pengkalan Chepa]].

== Etymology ==
Kota Bharu means "new city" or "new castle/fort" in Malay. Occasionally, the name of the city is written as Kota Baharu. 

==History==
Kota Bharu was founded during the late 19th century. Before the establishment, Kota Bharu was home to Kelantan's Royal Palace, then established by Sultan Muhammad II of Kelantan in 1844 as Kelantan's state capital who wanted the new state capital built in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpkbbri.gov.my/ms/pelawat/info-kota-bharu|title=Kota Bharu Municipal Council official website|access-date=20 May 2016}}</ref> Prior to this, Kota Bharu was known as Kuala Kelantan. Before Kota Bharu assumed the role, the Kelantanese capital was divided into two which were Kota Kubang Labu and Kota Pengkalan Datu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://buluhkubu.pi1m.my/index.php/info-pi1m/penerbitan/26-info-pi1m/51-sejarah|title=Pusat Internet 1 Malaysia|access-date=20 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624041255/http://buluhkubu.pi1m.my/index.php/info-pi1m/penerbitan/26-info-pi1m/51-sejarah|archive-date=24 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the 19th century, Kelantan was a prosperous and populous state with a population of around 30,000 to 50,000 people including a thousand Chinese. Production from within the state include gold, tin ore, black pepper, areca nut, rice, rattan, bamboo, agarwood and songket. Kota Bharu acts as entrepot for goods due to its strategic location beside the Kelantan River.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=The Historical Development of the Malay Peninsula Economic And Malay Society Economic Nature Pre-Colonial Era|url=http://journalarticle.ukm.my/8942/1/Sejarah_perkembangan_ekonomi_....pdf|journal=International Journal of the Malay World and Civilisation|access-date=20 May 2016}}</ref>

During World War II, Pantai Sabak, about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} from Kota Bharu, was the initial landing point of the Japanese invasion forces on 8 December 1941, beginning the [[Battle of Kota Bharu]], the first battle of the [[Japanese Invasion of Malaya|Malayan campaign]]. Japanese forces captured the city and would go on to successfully engage the British in jungle warfare and ultimately capture [[Singapore]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://army.mod.gov.my/perang_dunia_kedua.htm |title=Malaysian Armed Forces Official Website |access-date=4 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120045706/http://army.mod.gov.my/perang_dunia_kedua.htm |archive-date=20 January 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Kota Bharu was declared as the "Cultural City" on 25 July 1991 by the late [[Ismail Petra of Kelantan|Sultan Ismail Petra]] on the basis of two important aspects – the history of Kota Bharu and the uniqueness of its local arts and cultures. Kota Bharu was rebranded as the "Islamic City" ({{lang-ms|Bandar Raya Islam}}) by the Kelantan State Government on 1 October 2005 through its "Developing With Islam" ({{lang-ms|Membangun Bersama Islam}}) policy.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/5950739|title=The Changing Image And Identity Of Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia From Cultural City To Islamic City|journal=International Journal of Social Planning and Development|access-date=5 June 2022|last1=Harun |first1=Siti Norlizaiha }}</ref>
