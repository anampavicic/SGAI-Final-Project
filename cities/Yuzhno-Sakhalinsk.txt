'''Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk''' ({{langx|ru|Ю́жно-Сахали́нск}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈjuʐnə səxɐˈlʲinsk|IPA|Ru-Южно-Сахалинск.ogg}}, {{lit|South Sakhalin city}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Sakhalin Oblast]], [[Russia]]. It is located on [[Sakhalin]] Island in the [[Russian Far East]], north of [[Japan]].<ref name="worldatlas">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/eu/ru/sak/where-is-yuzhno-sakhalinsk.html|title=Where is Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia?|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> Gas and oil extraction as well as processing are amongst the main industries on the island. It was called '''Vladimirovka''' ({{lang|ru|Влади́мировка}}) from 1882 to 1905, then {{nihongo|'''Toyohara'''|豊原市|Toyohara-shi|lead=yes}} during its period of [[Imperial Japan]]ese control from 1905 to 1946. As of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], its population was&nbsp;181,728.<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>

==History==
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk began as a small Russian settlement called '''Vladimirovka''', founded by convicts in 1882.<ref name="endic">[http://endic.ru/history/JUzhno-Sahalinsk-49677.html Южно-сахалинск - Исторический словарь - Словари и Энциклопедии]</ref> The [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] in 1905, which brought an end to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905, awarded the southern half of the [[Sakhalin]] Island to [[Japan]]. Vladimirovka was renamed '''Toyohara''' (meaning "bountiful plain"), and was the prefect capital of the Japanese [[Karafuto Prefecture]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Amano |first1=Naoki |title=Sakhalin/Karafuto |url=https://oxfordre.com/asianhistory/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277727-e-673;jsessionid=BFF794CC16B08764EF292A33CE9E547E?rskey=tAWqhl&result=15#:~:text=From%201905%20to%201945%2C%20the,as%20it%20was%20then%20named.&text=(Photo%20by%20Author%2C%20September%202019%2C%20Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk). |website=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=11 May 2024}}</ref>
During the [[Soviet–Japanese War]] within [[World War II]], the city was recaptured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops. Ownership of the city was transferred to the Soviet Union and it was renamed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Town status was granted to it in 1946.<ref name="endic"/><gallery>

==Administrative and municipal status==
[[File:Location of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk District (Sakhalin Oblast).svg|thumb|left|Administrative borders of the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk District within Sakhalin Oblast]]
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]].<ref name="Ref407">Law #25-ZO</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with ten rural localities, incorporated as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Sakhalin Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref407" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is incorporated as '''Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Urban Okrug'''.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Due to significant investment from oil companies like [[ExxonMobil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk has experienced substantial economic growth. Although this growth has primarily occurred in the northern part of the island, both companies maintain headquarters and residential complexes in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk itself. The demand for natural resources by the [[Japan]]ese, [[China|Chinese]], and [[South Korea]]ns has ensured continued prosperity in the foreseeable future for the entire island.

There has been significant criticism, including from Presidential Envoy [[Kamil Iskhakov]], that Sakhalin is not caring for its citizens. Despite sizable gas deposits and incoming investments from gas companies, the regional administration does not yet have plans for the installation of gas services on the island. However, several improvements in the city have been made in the past 10 years, and it continues to grow in various aspects every year. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

One of the very few remaining Japanese buildings in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk now functions as the [[Sakhalin Regional Museum of Local Lore|local museum]]. The building was designed in the [[Imperial Crown Style|Emperor's Crown Style]] by Japanese architect Yoshio Kaizuka, and completed in 1937.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.russianmuseums.info/M1096|title=Sakhalin Regional Museum}}</ref>

===Transportation===
The city hosts the head office of [[Aurora (airline)|Aurora Airline]], subsidiary of [[Aeroflot]]. It is served by the [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport]]. The city is also the hub for the island's narrow gauge railway network that underwent conversion to Russian broad gauge in August 2019.<ref>"Российская колея по всему Сахалину: движение открыто".</ref> In addition to railways, the town is also a hub for roadways, such as the [[Russian federal highways|A-391]] (which travels south to [[Korsakov (town)|Korsakov]]) and the [[Russian federal highways|A-392]] (which travels west to [[Kholmsk]]).

Due to restrictions, foreigners wishing to leave Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in order to travel to any other part of the Sakhalin Oblast and its internal and territorial waters are required to seek permission from the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] (FSB) and the [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Border Guard]]. Scuba diving and recreating on the seacoast is permitted only in places defined by the Border Guard.<ref>[http://sakhalinindependent.com/ Freedom of movement for foreigners on Sakhalin restricted]</ref>

=== Population ===

Most residents are ethnic [[Russians]], but there also exists a sizable population of [[Koreans|Korean Russians]]. Of the 43,000 [[Sakhalin Koreans]], half are estimated to live in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, comprising roughly 12% of the city's population. Also smaller numbers of indigenous minorities, such as [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]] and [[Orok people|Oroks]] can be found.

=== Religion ===
The majority of the population are [[Russian Orthodoxy|Russian Orthodox]].

==Geography==
The city is located on the [[Susuya River]]. It is the largest city on the island, and the only one with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The straight-line distance to [[Moscow]] is {{convert|6660|km|sp=us}}.

===Climate===
The climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'') with mild summers and cold winters. Maritime influences can be seen in that precipitation is much higher than in interior Russia and that summers are distinctly cooler than in [[Khabarovsk]] or [[Irkutsk]], while winters are much milder. Summers are frequently [[fog]]gy, reducing the amount of sunshine. Considering its southerly maritime position winters are very cold, albeit warmer than expected for surrounding inland areas affected by the [[Siberian High]]. Snowfall is more frequent than in those areas, due to said maritime influence bringing moisture to the coastline. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is relatively sunny compared to [[Hokkaido]] locations, but gloomy by the lower latitudes of the Russian Far East's standards.
