==History==
{{RefImprove|section|date=July 2023}}

=== Imperial era ===
Nanning, an ancient city with a long history and rich culture, was part of [[Baiyue]] ethnic groups in the ancient time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 27, 2013 |title=古代南宁政权更迭史及审判史迹 |trans-title=The history of regime change and trial history in ancient Nanning |url=http://nnzy.chinacourt.gov.cn/article/detail/2013/09/id/1102427.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201224110457/http://nnzy.chinacourt.gov.cn/article/detail/2013/09/id/1102427.shtml |archive-date=24 December 2020 |url-status=live |agency=Nanning Court Network Editorial Board}}</ref> In the first year of Daxing period of [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (AD 318), Jinxing County, established here as one of the county towns, ushered a history of 1700 years of Nanning organizational system. During the Zhenguan period of [[Tang dynasty]] (AD 632), it was renamed Yong prefecture (Yongzhou) and established Yongzhou government seat, which is why it has been called Yong ({{lang|zh|邕}}) for short. In the first year of Taiding period of [[Yuan dynasty]] (AD1318), Yongzhou was renamed Nanning, meaning the Pacified South.

Nanning was once the territory of the Baiyue people and became the capital of Jinxing Prefecture which was separated from [[Yulin Commandery|Yulin Prefecture]] of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In 1076 during the [[Lý–Song War]] Yongshou was besieged by Lý forces. Under the leadership of Su Jian, the garrison held out for forty-two days before succumbing. The city was razed to the ground and its people massacred by [[Lý dynasty]].

In the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1324, it was renamed Nanning Lu (Nanning Circuit) of Yongzhou. Historically, Nanning was famous for trade, and had permanent business offices from other areas in China since the [[Song dynasty]]. In the [[Ming dynasty]] Nanning developed into an economic center of the Zuo River and the You River with the reputation of "Little [[Nanjing]]".

=== People's Republic era ===
On 4 December 1949, Nanning was captured by the Communist Party.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chinese Civil War - Nationalist collapse and the establishment of the People's Republic of China (1949) {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Chinese-Civil-War/Nationalist-collapse-and-the-establishment-of-the-Peoples-Republic-of-China-1949 |access-date=2023-07-09 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}</ref> in January 1950, Nanning municipality was set up, and identified as the capital city of Guangxi on 8 February of the same year; in March 1958, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was established, and Nanning municipality was the capital city.

Nanning served as host for the annual China–[[ASEAN]] Expo (CASEAN Expo) which began in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ASEAN and China Gear Up for CAEXPO |url=https://asean.org/asean-and-china-gear-up-for-caexpo/ |access-date=2023-07-09 |website=asean.org}}</ref> The city was also the venue for the 2006 World Robotics Olympiad.<ref>{{Cite web |last=admin |date=2021-08-18 |title=Previous Challenges |url=https://wro-association.org/competition/previous-challenges/ |access-date=2023-07-09 |website=WRO Association |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Nanning has jurisdiction over 7 [[District (PRC)|districts]], 1 [[county-level city]], 4 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]], and 6 development zones.
