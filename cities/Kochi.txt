In 1947, when India gained independence from the [[British colonial rule]], Cochin was the first [[princely state]] to join India willingly.<ref name="Corporation of Kochi" />
In 1949, [[Travancore–Cochin]] state came into being with the merger of Cochin and [[Travancore]]. The King of Travancore was the [[Rajpramukh]] of the Travancore–Cochin Union from 1949 to 1956. Travancore-Cochin, was in turn merged with the [[Malabar district]] of the [[Madras State]]. Finally, the [[Government of India]]'s [[States Reorganisation Act]] (1956) inaugurated a new state—Kerala—incorporating Travancore-Cochin (excluding the four southern Taluks which were merged with [[Tamil Nadu]]), Malabar District, and the [[tehsil|taluk]] of [[Kasaragod taluk|Kasargod]], [[South Kanara]].<ref name="lonelyplanet">{{Cite book

The government appointed a commission to study the feasibility of the suggested merger. Based on its report, the [[Kerala Legislative Assembly]] approved the corporation's formation. On 1 November 1967, exactly eleven years since the establishment of the state of Kerala, the [[Kochi Municipal Corporation]] came into existence. The merger leading to the establishment of the corporation, was between the [[municipalities]] of Ernakulam, Mattancherry and [[Fort Kochi]], along with that of the [[Willingdon Island]], four [[Panchayati raj in India|panchayats]] ([[Palluruthy]], [[Vennala]], [[Vyttila]] and [[Edappally]]), and the small islands of [[Gundu Island|Gundu]] and [[Ramanthuruth]].{{citation needed |date=August 2023}}
The Kochi and [[Ernakulam]] districts formed on 1 April 1958 carving areas of the erstwhile Travancore-Kochi-Malabar regions. A major portion of the district is from the Kochi kingdom.<ref name="ernakulam.nic.in">{{cite web|url=http://ernakulam.nic.in/history.htm|title=Ernakulam_History|access-date=5 April 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115160050/http://ernakulam.nic.in/history.htm|archive-date=15 November 2007}}</ref>

The city's economic growth gathered momentum after [[economic reforms in India]] introduced by the [[Government of India|central government]] in the early 1990s. Since 2000, the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service sector]] has energised the city's economy. The establishment of several industrial parks based on [[Information technology|IT]] and other port based infrastructure triggered a construction and realty boom in the city. Over the years, Kochi has witnessed rapid commercialisation, and has today grown into the commercial hub of Kerala.<ref name="Trade & Industry in Kochi">{{cite web

Soil consists of [[sediment]]s such as [[alluvium]], teris, brown sands, etc. Hydromorphic [[Soil salinity|saline soils]] are also found in the areas surrounding the backwaters.<ref name="Corporation of Kochi" />

Predominant rock types found here are [[Archean|Archaean]]-basic [[Dike (geology)|dykes]], [[Charnockite]]s and [[Gneiss]]es. An ecologically sensitive area, the [[Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary]] is located in the central part of the city.

=== Climate ===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Kochi features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''). Kochi's proximity to the equator along with its coastal location results in little seasonal temperature variation, with moderate to high levels of humidity. Annual temperatures range between {{convert|23|and|31|C|F}} with the record high being {{convert|36.5|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, and record low {{convert|16.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IMDextremes />
From June to September, the [[monsoon|south-west monsoon]] brings in heavy rains as Kochi lies on the windward side of the [[Western Ghats]]. From October to December, Kochi receives lighter (yet significant) rain from the northeast monsoon, as it lies on the leeward side. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|3014.9|mm|abbr=on}}, with an annual average of 124 rainy days.<ref name=IMDnormals />

[[State Highway 63 (Kerala)|SH 63, Vypeen Pallipuram Road]] and [[State Highway 66 (Kerala)|SH 66, Alappuzha – Thoppumpady road]] are coastal roads that serve the narrow sliver of land between the backwaters and the sea.

The main arterial roads of the city are the [[Mahatma Gandhi Road (Kochi)|Mahatma Gandhi Road]] and [[S.A Road|Sahodaran Ayyappan Road]] in Ernakulam, constructed in 1925 & 1962 respectively which runs parallel & perpendicular to the coast and having the proposed Metro Rail connectivity. The [[Seaport-Airport Road]] is another major road and connects the [[Cochin Port|Cochin Seaport]] to the [[Cochin International Airport]]. The Infopark Expressway in [[Kakkanad]] is connected to the Seaport-Airport Road and stretches all the way to [[Infopark, Kochi|Infopark]]. Other major roads include [[Chittoor Road]], [[Banerji Road]], [[Shanmugham Road]], [[Kochi Bypass]], [[Kaloor-Kadavanthra Road]], [[Park Avenue, Kochi|Park Avenue]] etc. A new ring road is proposed for Kochi city by the state government for which a project study is being currently undertaken by NATPAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mydreamhouse.in/ring-roads-kochi-city |title=Ring roads for Kochi city |publisher=MyDreamHouse.in |date=17 February 2012 |access-date=12 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426000744/http://www.mydreamhouse.in/ring-roads-kochi-city |archive-date=26 April 2013 }}</ref>

=== Public transport ===

==== Road ====
The primary form of public transport within the city is largely dependent on privately owned bus networks. The state-run also operates its services in the city through the Thirukochi service. The major bus terminals in the city are Ernakulam Town, Ernakulam Jetty and the private bus terminal at Kaloor. An integrated transit terminal namely The [[Vyttila Mobility Hub, Kochi|Mobility Hub]] at [[Vytilla]] is under second phase of construction. The terminal acts as a hub for long-distance bus services away from the city centre, and also a converging point for different modes of public transport, namely bus, metro and ferry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vyttilamobilityhub.com |title=Vyttila Mobility Hub |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302091308/http://www.vyttilamobilityhub.com/ |archive-date=2 March 2011 |access-date=3 March 2018 }}</ref>

Kochi is one of the few cities to be granted the new-generation air-conditioned low-floor and non-air-conditioned semi-low-floor buses under the [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission|JNNURM]] city transport development project. KURTC and private buses operate frequent schedules to neighbouring areas of [[Nedumbassery]], [[Perumbavoor]], [[Aluva]], [[Muvattupuzha]], [[Kothamangalam]], [[Cherthala]] and [[Poochakkal]]. Taxis and [[auto rickshaw]]s (called ''autos'') are available for hire throughout the day.

Development of road infrastructure not keeping pace with the increase in traffic is a major problem faced by Kochi, like most other parts of Kerala.<ref name="Traffic">{{cite web|publisher=Kochi Municipal Corporation |url=http://www.corporationofcochin.net/urban_kb/Traffic%20&%20Transportation.pdf |title=Kochi Municipal Corporation – Urban Knowledge Base |access-date=25 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125004643/http://www.corporationofcochin.net/urban_kb/Traffic%20%26%20Transportation.pdf |archive-date=25 January 2011 }}</ref>

==== Rail ====
The city has four major railway stations – [[Ernakulam Junction]], [[Ernakulam Town]] (locally known as the ''South'' and ''North'' railway stations respectively), [[Aluva railway station|Aluva]], and [[Tripunithura railway station|Tripunithura]] followed by smaller stations, [[Edappally railway station|Edapally]] and Kalamassery. There is also the [[Cochin Harbour Terminus railway station|Cochin Harbour Terminus]] providing rail connectivity to the southern segment of the [[Port of Kochi]]. The terminus is currently under renovation for the suburban rail networks in the city. The main rail transport system in Kochi is operated by the [[Southern Railway Zone (India)|Southern Railway Zone]] of [[Indian Railways]], and comes under [[Thiruvananthapuram Railway division]]. The [[Ernakulam Junction|South]] station is one of the busiest railway stations in South India, with more than 128 scheduled train services daily.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://indiarailinfo.com/arrivals/52| title=Ernakulam Junction (South)/ERS Railway Station – Today's Train Arrival Timings – All Trains – India Rail Info – Database of Indian Railways Trains & Stations| publisher=India Rail Info| date=19 June 2010| access-date=14 October 2010| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713025143/http://indiarailinfo.com/arrivals/52| archive-date=13 July 2011}}</ref> The [[Ernakulam Town|North]] station situated on the northern side of the city, caters mostly to long-distance services that bypass the [[Ernakulam Junction|South]] station, and also is an additional halt station for many trains.

There is also a historic station named as [[Ernakulam Terminus]](station code:ERG) situated behind the [[High court of Kerala|High Court]]. Great personalities like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and The [[British Viceroy]] have visited Cochin through this old railway station. Ernakulam Terminus was the first station to serve the city but had to be abandoned in the early 1960s. Now this station operates as a goods depot of Southern Railway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/gallery/Trips/south/csr-erg/ |title=Cochin State Railways |publisher=Irfca.org |access-date=12 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120143755/http://www.irfca.org/gallery/Trips/south/csr-erg/ |archive-date=20 January 2012 }}</ref>

==== Metro ====
{{Main|Kochi Metro}}
The [[Kochi Metro]] is a [[Rapid transit|metro rapid transit system]] serving the city of Kochi, intended to considerably ease traffic congestion in the city and its surrounding metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/07/stories/2010030761160300.htm/ |title=More funds for metro rail; sanction yet to be granted |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805025944/http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/07/stories/2010030761160300.htm |work=[[The Hindu]] |archive-date=5 August 2011 }}</ref> It is being set up at an overall estimated cost of {{INRConvert|5146|c|nolink=nos}}.

It also operates passenger ships to [[Colombo]] and [[Lakshadweep]]. Boat services are operated by [[Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation]], the [[Kerala State Water Transport Department|State Water Transport Department]] and private firms from various [[jetty|boat jetties]] in the city. The ''junkar'' ferry for the transshipment of vehicles and passengers between the islands are operated between Ernakulam and [[Vypin]], and between Vypin and Fort Kochi. However, with the construction of the [[Goshree bridges]] (which links Kochi's islands), ferry transport has become less essential. The main boat jetties are Ernakulam Main Boat Jetty near Park Avenue, High Court Jetty in Banerjee Road, Embarkation Jetty in Willingdon Island and Fort Kochi Jetty.<ref>{{cite news| newspaper=[[The Hindu]]| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ernakulamwest-kochi-circular-ferry-services-from-tomorrow/article5032933.ece| title=Ernakulam-West Kochi circular ferry services from tomorrow| access-date=12 January 2018| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112215256/http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ernakulamwest-kochi-circular-ferry-services-from-tomorrow/article5032933.ece| archive-date=12 January 2018}}</ref> In April 2023, Kochi became India's first city to have a water metro project. The [[Kochi Water Metro]] is the first water metro project in India and the first integrated water transport system of this size in Asia connects 10 islands of Kochi through a network of 15 routes that span 76&nbsp;km and 38 jetties.
