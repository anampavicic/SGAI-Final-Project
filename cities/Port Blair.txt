Port Blair is the entry point for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is connected with [[mainland India]] by both air and sea. It is a two to three-hour flight from mainland India to Port Blair's [[Veer Savarkar International Airport]] and three to four days by sea to reach [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], or [[Visakhapatnam]] from Haddo Wharf in the city.

===Pre-history===
The indigenous inhabitants are the [[Andamanese peoples|Andamanese]].

===Modern history===
In 1789 the Government of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] established a penal colony on [[Chatham Island (Andaman and Nicobar Islands)|Chatham Island]] in the southeast bay of [[Great Andaman]], named Port Blair in the honour of [[Archibald Blair]] of the [[East India Company]]. After two years, the colony moved to the northeast part of Great Andaman and was named [[Port Cornwallis]] after Admiral [[William Cornwallis]]. However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony, and the government ceased operating it in May 1796.

In 1824 Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]] were often attacked and killed by the natives, alarming the [[British Raj|British government]]. In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a convict establishment, but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction.

However, since the rebellion provided the British with a lot of new prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison an urgent necessity. Construction began in November 1857 at the renovated Port Blair, avoiding the vicinity of a saltwater swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the old colony's problems. The penal colony was originally on [[Viper Island]]. The convicts, mostly [[political prisoner]]s, suffered [[life imprisonment]] at [[Penal labour|hard labour]] under cruel and degrading conditions. Many were hanged, while others died of disease and starvation. Between 1864 and 1867 a penal establishment was also built with convict labour on the northern side of Ross Island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/features/andaman/stories/2004081500270300.htm |title=The Hindu : Notorious once, it stands shrouded in silence now |access-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227180955/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/features/andaman/stories/2004081500270300.htm |archive-date=27 December 2008 }} T.

As the [[Indian independence movement]] continued to grow in the late 19th century, the enormous [[Cellular Jail]] was constructed between 1896 and 1906 to house Indian convicts, mostly political prisoners, in [[solitary confinement]]. The Cellular Jail is also known as ''Kala Pani'' (translated as "Black Waters"), a name given to it due to the torture and general ill-treatment of its Indian convicts.

In [[World War II]] the islands were [[Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands|occupied by the Japanese]] on 23 March 1942 without opposition from the garrison. From 1943 to 1944, Port Blair served as the headquarters of the [[Azad Hind]] government under [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. British forces returned to the islands in October 1945.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jayant Dasgupta|title=Japanese in Andaman & Nicobar Islands: red sun over black water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aw5uAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Manas Publications|isbn=978-81-7049-138-5}}</ref>

Although affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], Port Blair survived sufficiently to act as a base for relief efforts in the islands. In 2017 it was selected as one of the cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under the [[Smart Cities Mission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/kMLIQKW3xIqOUzFJ5sZadN/Smart-cities-More-names-of-cities-to-be-announced-today.html|title=13 cities included in Phase 1 of Smart Cities Mission|last=Khanna|first=Pretika|date=24 May 2016|newspaper=[[LiveMint]]|access-date=4 January 2017}}</ref>

==Climate==
Port Blair has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Am''), with little variation in average temperature and large amounts of precipitation throughout the year. All months except January, February, and March receive substantial rainfall.
