==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}

===Pre-Columbian history===
When the Spanish arrived, the region was inhabited by various Caribbean tribes. Among them were the Caracas, the Teques, the Cumanagotos, the Mariches and the Quiriquires. The Teques inhabited the southwestern part of Guaire. The Mariches inhabited the eastern part of the Caracas Valley. They practiced hunting and gathering, while others lived by fishing. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, these tribes were brave enough to fight for their territory, commanded by caciques like Guaicaipuro and Yare.

===Spanish Colonization===
Guaicaipuro was a legendary cacique of the Teques and Caracas Indians who resisted the conquistador Diego de Losada, while cacique Yare was the cumanagoto, quiriquire, charagoto and arauco chief who killed Captain Mendoza, who had murdered the Indian Tamanaco. Once all the tribes were subdued, the Spaniards settled completely on these lands, founding the city of Caracas, and later different towns in the interior of the state of Miranda.
[[File:Izcaragua country club Miranda State Venezuela 5.jpg|thumb|Colonial Hacienda in Izcaragua]]
During the colony this region became part of the Province of Caracas. At the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th century the highlands were used to cultivate, among other products, wheat destined largely for export to Cartagena de Indias and the Caribbean islands. From the second decade of the 17th century, cocoa displaced these crops. In addition, all commercial activities were monopolized by the Royal Guipuzcoa Company, which generated the first discontents and uprisings against the crown. From the beginning of the 17th century, slave labour quickly replaced the Indian labour force, concentrating on the Windward region, which was the largest cocoa producer. It was in this region that the first free blacks rose up against their masters, but were later stifled by Spanish troops.

===19th Century===
After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, Venezuela still used the provinces as a political-territorial organization, which had been used for a long time. Miranda, at that time, was part of a province. Between 1832 and 1855 the use of the province persisted due to the confusion generated by the existence of a state as a political division of the country.

The division by states did not appear in Venezuela in a concrete way until 1864, when about twenty states were founded which, in the following governments, would be reduced to nine, among these, the founded state of Guzmán Blanco, which by 1873 only covered the region of Aragua.
[[File:Miranda in Venezuela (1891).svg|thumb|Miranda in 1889-1898]]
In 1881, the State of Guzmán Blanco expanded its territory to include the region of Miranda, among other nearby regions that were included as part of Guárico.

In 1889, the territory of the Guzmán Blanco State was again modified by the Constitution, and its size was reduced by excluding several regions of the country such as the region of Aragua, but renaming the State as Edo Miranda.

===20th and 21st Centuries===
In 1900, by decree of General Cipriano Castro, the state of Caracas was included in Miranda and Caracas was renamed Miranda State with the provisional capital in Santa Lucia. Then in 1901 the political-territorial space is modified again and the capital of the state becomes Petare, and in 1904 it is changed to Ocumare del Tuy.

In 1909 the last important modification was made, changing the capital to Los Teques.

In 1982, the municipality of Los Salias was founded through the Official Gazette of the State of Miranda.

In 1989, after the decentralization carried out by President Carlos Andrés Perez, Arnaldo Arocha was elected the first governor by popular vote.

By October 15, 2017, Héctor Rodríguez was elected governor of the State of Miranda, after facing Carlos Ocariz in an election.

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}

===Location===
The state of Miranda is located in the north-central part of Venezuela. It is part of the so-called Capital Region together with the Capital District and the state of Vargas. It is located in the central coastal area of the country.

It borders on the north with the Federal District, on the south with the states of Guarico and Aragua, on the east with the Caribbean Sea and on the west with Aragua.
Relief
The relief is predominantly rugged and abrupt, with high slopes and narrow valleys within the mountains. The eastern sector constitutes a depression in the Serranía del Litoral. The Guaire River, which runs through the city of Caracas, divides the sector into two strips that are differentiated by their decline: the Valles del Tuy and La Depresión de Barlovento.

The waters that make up the hydrographic network of the state are mostly short course. The main river basin in the State is that of the River Tuy. The availability of water resources in the state is really precarious, as the state is located in the largest urban conglomerate in the country. The volume of available water is committed to supply almost the entire metropolitan district of Caracas, as well as the entire territory of Mirandina, which is poorly supplied by the reservoirs of La Mariposa, Lagartijo, La Pereza, Ocumarito, Agua Fría, Taguaza, El Guapo and Quebrada Seca. Many of the towns in the state are not frequently supplied with drinking water due to the high consumption of water resources. The Guaire, Tuy and Grande rivers are not used because they are in a state of contamination.

===Hydrography===
The hydrography of Miranda State is characterized by the short course and low flow of its rivers, with the exception of Tuy. This characteristic, combined with the settlement of the largest mass of population in the country, gives its rivers great significance as sources of water for urban consumption. The Tuy River, with a length of 250&nbsp;km, rises at an altitude of 2 100 m, on the southern flank of the Litoral mountain range, flows eastwards through the Abra de Tácata to the Tuy and Barlovento valleys, and flows into the Caribbean Sea through the Paparo mouth. The El Jarillo River and the Aguas Frías and La Negra streams, tributaries of the Tuy on the left bank, have been dammed, near the Teques, in the Agua Fría reservoir, while the Ocumare, was dammed near Ocumare del Tuy, in the Ocumarito reservoir. The best known tributary is the Guaire River. On the right bank, the Tuy receives the Taguaza, Taguacita and Cuira rivers. Other important rivers are the Guarenas, Rio Grande or Caucagua, Capaya, El Guapo, Pacairigua, El Curiepe and Cúpira.
[[File:Tacarigua Lagoon National Park - Parque Nacional Laguna de Tacarigua (10296002123).jpg|thumb|Tacarigua Lagoon National Park]]

===Climate===
The climate of Miranda State is very hot in the low areas with temperatures ranging from 20&nbsp;°C to 42&nbsp;°C with very high humidity in the coastal region of Barlovento. In the Altos Mirandinos region, temperatures vary slightly throughout the year. In the dry season (December–March), temperatures vary between 10&nbsp;°C and 23&nbsp;°C, in the beginning of the wet season (April, May) high temperatures can be registered up to 33&nbsp;°C, the rest of the year it varies between 16&nbsp;°C and 25&nbsp;°C.

===Soil===
The state of Miranda has soils with a high agricultural vocation that have been used since colonial times for the cultivation of cocoa, fruits, vegetables, cereals and other subsistence crops. However, the pressure of urban and industrial activities, especially the settlement of high population concentrations, has meant a loss of very considerable agricultural areas in the Tuy Valleys, in the Guarenas and Guatire area, and in the Barlovento region.

===Fauna===
In mountainous areas, rivers and streams, it is common to see mammals such as the raccoon (''[[Didelphis marsupialis]]'') and the spiny rat (''[[Proechimys]]'' sp.), the squirrel (''[[Sciurus granatensis]]''), the mountain buckthorn (''[[Dasypus novemcinctus]]''), the porcupine (''[[Coendou prehensilis]]''), the agouti (''[[Dasyprocta leporina]]''), the sloth (''[[Bradypus tridactylus]]'') very common in all areas of the municipality, the rabbit (''[[Sylvilagus brasiliensis]]''), and the one that has almost disappeared from the municipal area, the matacan deer (''[[Mazama americana]]'') that was common in the area of Turgua.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} In addition, at night it is common to observe bats, among which the list bat (''[[Saccopteryx bilineata]]''), common fruit bat (''[[Artibeus jamaicensis]]''), common vampire bat (''[[Desmodus rotundus]]''), and house bat (''[[Molossus molossus]]'') stand out. In the area of Los Carraos and Zuloaga caves, the insectivorous bat species ''[[Natalus tumidirostris]]'', ''[[Myotis keaysi]]'' and ''[[Tadarida aurispinosa]]'' have been identified.

===Flora===
Among the common trees to find in the forest are, the ladle or child (''[[Gyranthera caribensis]]''), the bitter cedar (''[[Cedrela mexicana]]''), milky of the genus ''Sapium'' (''[[Sapium stylare]]''), yagrumo (''[[Cecropia peltata]]''), yagrumo male (''[[Didymopanax morototoni]]''), bucare (''[[Erythrina poeppigiana]]''), ceiba (''[[Ceiba pentandra]]''), indio desnudo (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''); in some parts of the state the native flora has been intervened and replaced by fruit trees such as guamo (''[[Inga fastuosa]]''), mango (''[[Mangifera indica]]''), orange (''[[Citrus × sinensis]]''), mandarin (''[[Citrus × tangerina]]''), guava (''[[Psidium guajava]]''), pomarosa (''[[Syzygium jambos]]''), avocado (''[[Persea americana]]'') and cambur (''[[Musa × paradisiaca]]'').

In the urban area it is common to see different types of ornamental trees, among which we can highlight the eucalyptus (''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis]]''), apamates (''[[Tabebuia rosea]]''), araguaneyes (''[[Tabebuia chrysantha]]''), mahoganies (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), soaps (''[[Hura crepitans]]''), kujis (''[[Acacia farnesiana]]''), samans (''[[Pithecellobium saman]]''), bamboos (''[[Bambusa vulgaris]]''), riqui riquis (''[[Heliconia latispatha]]'') and tapir nails (''[[Philodendron]]'')

[[File:Brown Swiss from Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Cattle in Chaguamaral, Miranda State]]
The tertiary sector is extremely important: financial, commercial and service activities are concentrated in the area of Miranda. During the last two decades the tourist activity has grown with the installation of a great hotel infrastructure in the coast of Barlovento.

Cereals are grown in the fertile valleys of Tuy, while the microclimates are used for horticultural and fruit activities whose products are processed in the agro-industries.

In suburban areas, poultry and pig farming are practiced, especially promoted by Portuguese, Spanish and Italian immigrants.

Coffee production has decreased; however, the expansion of sugar cane and cotton crops in the Tuy Valley continues. Since colonial times there have been cocoa plantations in Barlovento combined with cassava, yams, caraotas or beans and bananas.

The industrialization process had an important economic impact, favored by its proximity to the city of Caracas, mainly in the cities of Petare, Guarenas and Guatire and in the valley of Tuy, where manufacturing centers of the metal-mechanical, chemical and food sectors were established. This led to a major urban boom, which caused a decrease in the amount of agricultural land.

===Palmeros de Chacao===
The tradition of the Palmeros de Chacao dates back to the Venezuelan colonial period in 1770, when the parish priest José Antonio Mohedano decided, in the form of a promise, to ask God for mercy due to an epidemic of yellow fever that existed in Caracas at the time. Coming from the haciendas near El Avila National Park, Mohedano sent a group of workers to bring down leaves from the Royal Palm to commemorate Jesus' entry into Jerusalem.

Nowadays, the Palmeros go up every Friday of the Council (the Friday before Palm Sunday) and come down the following Saturday with the palm leaves that will be blessed during the Sunday celebration. The palms are collected from a sector called Cueva de los Palmeros by the entrance of Sabas Nieves. Once blessed, the palms are distributed among the believers, who braid, crush and transform them into crosses that they keep in their homes as a sign of faith.

===Diablos Danzantes de Yare===
The Diablos Danzantes de Yare is a religious festival celebrated in San Francisco de Yare, Miranda State (Venezuela), on Corpus Christi Day, carried out by the "Sociedades del Santísimo Sacramento". The festival is a local version of the dancing devils of Corpus Christi.

Its origin dates back to the 18th century, being this the oldest brotherhood in the American continent and the largest in the world. The fraternity of devils is divided into a hierarchical order, represented in their masks.

Every Thursday of Corpus Christi (9 Thursdays after Holy Thursday) there is a ritual dance of the so-called dancing devils, where they worship the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar and celebrate the triumph of good over evil.
