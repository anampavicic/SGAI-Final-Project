'''Kaifeng''' ({{zh|s=开封|p=Kāifēng}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in east-[[Zhongyuan|central]] [[Henan]] province, China. It is one of the [[Historical capitals of China|Eight Ancient Capitals of China]], having been the capital eight times in history, and is most known for having been the Chinese capital during the [[Song dynasty#Northern Song, 960–1127|Northern Song dynasty]].

As of the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]], 4,824,016 people lived in Kaifeng's Prefecture, of whom 1,735,581 lived in the metropolitan area consisting of Xiangfu, Longting, Shunhe Hui, Gulou and Yuwantai Districts. Located along the [[Yellow River]]'s southern bank, it borders the provincial capital of [[Zhengzhou]] to the west, [[Xinxiang]] to the northwest, [[Shangqiu]] to the east, [[Zhoukou]] to the southeast, [[Xuchang]] to the southwest, and [[Heze]] of [[Shandong]] to the northeast.

Kaifeng is  a major city for scientific research, appearing among the world's top 200 [[List of cities by scientific output|cities by scientific output]] as tracked by the [[Nature Index]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Leading 200 science cities 2023{{!}} {{!}} Supplements {{!}} Nature Index |url=https://www.nature.com/nature-index/supplements/nature-index-2023-science-cities/tables/overall |access-date=2024-01-20 |website=www.nature.com}}</ref> The city is home to a campus of [[Henan University]], one of the national key universities in the [[Double First Class University Plan]].

==Names==
The [[postal romanization]] for the city is "Kaifeng". Its official one-character abbreviation in Chinese is {{lang|zh|汴}} (''Biàn''). Historically it has also been known as:
*''Dàliáng'' ({{zh|c=大梁}})
*''Biànliáng'' ({{zh|labels=no |c=汴梁}})
*''Biànzhōu'' ({{zh|labels=no |c=汴州}})
*''Nánjīng'' ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|南京}}}}), from its status as the [[Jurchen Jin]]'s southern capital and not to be confused with modern-day [[Nanjing]]
*''Dōngjīng'' ({{zh|labels=no |t=[[Dongjing (disambiguation)|東京]]}})
*''Biànjīng'' ({{zh|labels=no |c=汴京}})

The area was named "Kaifeng" after the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]]'s [[Qin's wars of unification|conquest of China]] in the second century BC. The name literally means "opening the border" and figuratively "hidden" and "vengeance".<ref>{{cite book |script-title=zh:中国古今地名大辞典 |year=2005 |location=Shanghai |publisher=[[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] |page=348 |language=zh-hans}}</ref> Its name was originally Qifeng ({{zh|t=啓封}}), but the syllable ''qi'' (Baxter-Sagart: /*kʰˤijʔ/) was changed to the essentially synonymous ''kai'' (/*Nə-[k]ʰˤəj/, /*[k]ʰˤəj/) to avoid the [[naming taboo]] of Liu Qi ([[Emperor Jing of Han]]).

==Administration==
The [[prefecture-level city]] of Kaifeng administers five [[district of China|districts]] and four [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]:
*[[Gulou District, Kaifeng|Gulou District]]
*[[Longting District]]
*[[Yuwangtai District]]
*[[Xiangfu District]]
*[[Shunhe Hui District]]
*[[Weishi County]]
*[[Qi County, Kaifeng|Qi County]]
*[[Tongxu County]]
*[[Lankao County]]

Kaifeng is one of the [[Historical capitals of China|Eight Ancient Capitals of China]]. As with Beijing, there have been many reconstructions during its history.<ref>{{Cite web |last=焦 |first=健 |date= |year=2015 |orig-date=2015年06月18日17:19 |title=中国八大古都_共产党员网 |trans-title=China's eight ancient capitals_Communist Party website |url=https://www.12371.cn/2015/06/18/ARTI1434618611228380.shtml |access-date=2024-05-31 |website=www.12371.cn}}</ref><!--inaccessible Nov 6, 2010<ref>[http://www.kfsy.cn/n544c29.shtml 考古撩开开封"城摞城"神秘面纱]</ref>-->

In 364 BC during the [[Warring States period]], the [[Wei (state)|State of Wei]] founded a city called Daliang ({{lang|zh-hant|大梁}}) as its capital in this area. During this period, the first of many canals in the area was constructed linking a local river to the [[Yellow River]]. When the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] conquered the State of Wei, Kaifeng was destroyed and abandoned except for a mid-sized market town, which remained in place.<ref>{{Cite web |last=陈 |first=玥 |year=2024 |orig-date=02.07 09:10 |title=地上有“地下悬河” 地下“城摞城”：开封“城摞城”揭秘 |trans-title=Underground Hanging River’ Underground “City Stacked on City”: Kaifeng “City Stacked on City” Uncovered |url=https://www.cctv.com/geography/news/20020207/6.html |access-date=2024-05-31 |website=www.cctv.com |publisher=新华社 |language=zh |via=国家地理}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=李晨翀 |first=晨翀 |year=2019 |orig-date=2019-10-10 22:01:14 |title=【寻访大运河文化带开封篇一】一城宋韵半城水 |trans-title=The Grand Canal Cultural Belt in Kaifeng: A City of Song Rhythm and Half a City of Water |url=http://yunhe.china.com.cn/2019-10/10/content_40916547.htm |access-date=2024-05-31 |website=yunhe.china.com.cn |publisher=开封网 |language=zh}}</ref>

During the [[Han dynasty]], the city underwent some reconstruction. Kaifeng became the capital of [[Liu Wu, Prince of Liang|Liu Wu]] (son of Han emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Wen]]) when he was enfeoffed as Prince of Liang. Liu Wu restored and constructed many buildings and old city walls. Kaifeng became a center of music, art, a refuge for artists, and of splendid gardens despite the trivial political importance of the city at this period.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |year=1996 |isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul |location=Chicago |pages=420|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

Early in the 7th century, Kaifeng was transformed into a major commercial hub when it was connected to the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] as well as through the construction of a canal running to western [[Shandong]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=贾兵强 |first=兵强 |year=2023 |orig-date=2023-01-10 |title=大运河走向与沿河城市的兴衰 |trans-title=The Direction of the Grand Canal and the Rise and Fall of Cities Along the River |url=https://5g.dahe.cn/theory/202301101166308 |access-date=2024-05-31 |website=5g.dahe.cn |publisher=大河网}}</ref>

In 781 during the [[Tang dynasty]], a new city was reconstructed and named Bian ({{lang|zh|汴}}). Bian was the capital of the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]], [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]] (936–946), [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]] (947–950), and [[Later Zhou]] (951–960) of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. The [[Song dynasty]] made Bian its capital when it overthrew the Later Zhou (Chenqiao incident) in 960. Shortly afterwards, the city underwent further expansion.

During the Song, when it was known as Dongjing or Bianjing, Kaifeng, then the largest and most prosperous city in China, was the capital, with a population of over 400,000 living both inside and outside the city wall. [[Typhus]] was an acute problem in the city. The historian [[Jacques Gernet]] provides a lively picture of life in this period in his ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276,'' which often draws on ''[[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu]]'', a nostalgic memoir of the city of Kaifeng.<ref>Jacques Gernet. ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276.'' (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1962). Translated by H. M. Wright. {{ISBN|0804707200}}.</ref>

In 1049, the Youguosi Pagoda ({{lang|zh-hant|佑國寺塔}}) – or [[Iron Pagoda]] as it is called today – was constructed measuring {{cvt|54.7|m|sp=us}} in height. It has survived the vicissitudes of war and floods to become the oldest landmark in this ancient city. Another Song-dynasty pagoda, {{Interlanguage link|Po Tower|zh|3=繁塔}}, dating from 974, has been partially destroyed.
[[File:Song-Imperial-Garden1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Games in the Jinming Pool'', an early 12th-century painting depicting Kaifeng, by [[Zhang Zeduan]].]]

Another well-known sight was the [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[clock tower]] of the engineer, scientist, and statesman [[Su Song]] (1020–1101 AD). It was crowned with a rotating [[armillary sphere]] that was [[hydraulics|hydraulically powered]] (i.e. by [[water wheel]] and a [[water clock]]), yet it incorporated an [[escapement]] mechanism two hundred years before they were found in the clockworks of [[Europe]] and featured the first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]].

Kaifeng reached its peak importance in the 11th century as a commercial and industrial center at the intersection of four major canals. During this time, the city was surrounded by three rings of city walls and probably had a population of between 600,000 and 700,000. It is believed that Kaifeng was the largest city in the world from 1013 to 1127.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zhengzhou & Kaifeng Introduction, Zhengzhou & Kaifeng travel guide - Easy Tour China |url=https://www.easytourchina.com/tip-v581-zhengzhou-kaifeng-introduction |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=www.easytourchina.com}}</ref>

This period ended in 1127 when the city fell to [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] invaders during the [[Jingkang Incident]]. It subsequently came under the rule of the Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], which had conquered most of [[North China]] during the [[Jin–Song Wars]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Lorge |title=War, Politics and Society in Early Modern China, 900–1795 |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-203-96929-8 |pages=52–54}}</ref> While it remained an important administrative center, only the area inside the inner city wall of the early Song remained settled and the two outer rings were abandoned.

As the imperial capital of the Song, Kaifeng was conveniently situated along the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] for logistics supply but militarily vulnerable due to its position on the [[floodplain]]s of the [[Yellow River]].

Kaifeng served as the Jurchen "southern capital" from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time.<!--Ref inaccessible Nov 6 2010[http://www.san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#9]--><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/7345-2-7037.pdf|title=The Eastern Manchurian Woodsmen Replacing the Western Manchurian Nomads|access-date=November 6, 2010|archive-date=2007-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705112718/http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/7345-2-7037.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> The Jurchen kept their main capital further north until 1214 when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee from the onslaught of the [[Mongols]]. In 1232 they succumbed to the combined Mongol and Song forces in the [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng]]. The Mongols captured the city and in 1279 [[Mongol invasion of China|conquered all of China]]. During the Yuan dynasty Bianliang became the capital of [[Henan Jiangbei Province]], which was established in 1277.

In the Mongol siege of Kaifeng, the Mongols and Han Chinese (who defected to the Mongols) slaughtered the male members of the Jin Jurchen Wanyan Imperial family and took the royal women including the Jin concubines and princesses to Mongolia as war booty. Mongols looted the city when it fell, but atypical to most sieges in the time period, they permitted trade. The richest residents of the city sold their luxury belongings to Mongol soldiers for critically needed food supplies. Male members of the Jurchen Jin Wanyan royal family residing in the city were captured and executed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Carter |first=James |date=2022-04-06 |title=A Mongol siege, the Black Death, and the end of two dynasties |url=https://thechinaproject.com/2022/04/06/a-mongol-siege-the-black-death-and-the-end-of-two-dynasties/ |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=The China Project |language=en-US}}</ref> All Jin imperial concubines, including the empress dowager, were captured and taken north.<ref name="liezhuan2">{{cite book |title=金史 |volume=64 |language=zh |trans-title=History of Jin |chapter=列傳第二 后妃下 (Biographies 2, Imperial wives and concubines [lower volume])}}</ref>

In 1260, [[Marco Polo]] arrived at Kaifeng, and wrote about it in his diaries.

The city was briefly captured around the mid-14th century by the [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turban]] rebels who made it their capital for ten years. They were crushed by the newly established Ming forces. At the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368, Kaifeng was made the capital of Henan province.<ref name=":0" />

In 1642, [[1642 Yellow River flood|Kaifeng was flooded]] by the Ming army with water from the Yellow River to prevent the peasant rebel [[Li Zicheng]] from taking over. After this disaster, the city was abandoned again. In 1662, during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], Kaifeng was rebuilt. Another reconstruction in 1843 followed flooding in 1841, shaping Kaifeng as it stands today.

From the 8th to 9th century and up to the 19th century, Kaifeng is known for having the [[History of the Jews in China|oldest extant Jewish community in China]], the [[Kaifeng Jews]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ainslie |first=Mary J. |date=March 2021 |title=Chinese Philosemitism and Historical Statecraft: Incorporating Jews and Israel into Contemporary Chinese Civilizationism |journal=[[The China Quarterly]] |language=en |volume=245 |pages=208–226 |doi=10.1017/S0305741020000302 |issn=0305-7410 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=JTA and Stuart Winer |title=5 Chinese women immigrate to Israel, plan conversion |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/5-chinese-women-immigrate-to-israel-plan-conversion/ |access-date=2022-09-14 |website=www.timesofisrael.com |language=en-US}}</ref> As of 2016, there are 20 Jews still left in the city.<ref name=":1" />
