'''Lamitan''', officially the '''City of Lamitan''' ([[Chavacano language|Chavacano]]: ''Ciudad de Lamitan''; [[Yakan language|Yakan]]: ''Siyudad Lamitanin''; [[Tausūg language|Tausūg]]: ''Dāira sin Lamitan''; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Lamitan}}), is a 6th class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and ''[[de jure]]'' capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Basilan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 100,150 people.{{PH census|current}}

The city is bounded on the east by the municipality of [[Tuburan, Basilan|Tuburan]], on the south by [[Tipo-Tipo, Basilan|Tipo-Tipo]], on the west by [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]] and on the north by [[Basilan Strait]].

==Etymology==
''Lamitan'' is derived from the word ''Lami-Lamihan'', which signifies a combination of Merrymaking and Conference. The town was named after the first [[Spaniards]] from [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]] who blew up the area. When the [[Spaniards]] arrived, the [[Yakan people|Yakans]] were celebrating their national holiday. The explorers asked for the name of the place; the [[Yakan people|Yakans]]  assumed they were asking about the merrymaking and explained that it was the ''Lami-Lamihan'' celebration; the [[Spaniards]] misunderstood their response and later referred to the location as ''Lamitan''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=EXECUTIVE SUMMARY |url=https://www.coa.gov.ph/download/1690/basilan/28620/lamitan-city-executive-summary-2016.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=QRYW25hSpClvmHddtArrE4RgZwq.zeiqFgovXFNYleI-1718834646-0.0.1.1-4244 |access-date=June 20, 2024 |website=Commission on Audit}}</ref>

==History==

===Early history===
According to the city's earliest recorded historical source, the ''Tagihamas'', also known as the ''Land Dyaks of Sarawak'', were the first known settlers to [[Basilan]], later evolving into the [[Yakan people|Yakan]] group. Yakan's home base was in the area that would become known as Lamitan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=HISTORICAL BACKGROUND |url=https://www.lamitancity.gov.ph/lcw/about-lamitan/ |access-date=June 20, 2024 |website=Lamitan City Website: Official Website of Lamitan City}}{{source-attribution}}</ref>

===Colonization era===
During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[American Colonization Society|American]], and [[Philippines campaign (1941–1942)|Japanese]] occupations, the town was designated as one of [[Basilan]]'s municipal districts, which were then part of [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. 

Pedro "''Datu Kalun''" Javier Cuevas is regarded as the founding father of Lamitan. His parents, Sebastian Cuevas and Gregoria Javier, gave birth to him on May 6, 1845, in [[Bacoor]], [[Cavite]]. Pedro was a passionate young man who cherished his hometown and was pious. He was sentenced to death at the age of 27 for his anti-Spanish efforts during the [[1872 Cavite mutiny|Cavite Uprising of 1872]], along with two other comrades. They were accused of causing the death of a Spanish Guardia Civil officer. His sentence was reduced to life in prison due to his indirect involvement in the killing.

In June 1886, a man named Pedro Javier Cuevas, also known as ''Datu Kalun'' in [[Basilan]] history, took over leadership from the native chieftains and founded the settlement of Lamitan. The settlement grew into a town with political boundaries that included the Guiong River in the southeast and the Balagtasan River in the northwest. With the passage of time, an influx of Christian settlers arrived, who, along with their Muslim neighbors, paved the path for agricultural development in the region.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Unson |first=John |date=June 26, 2022 |title=Lamitan honors Caviteño who resisted Spain, became datu, founded city |url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2022/06/26/2191073/lamitan-honors-caviteo-who-resisted-spain-became-datu-founded-city |access-date=June 20, 2024 |work=philstar.com}}</ref>

In 1937, Lamitan became part of [[Zamboanga City]]. [[Basilan]] became a chartered city on July 1, 1948, as a result of ''Republic Act No. 288'', which was sponsored by Congressman Juan S. Alano.

===Establishment===
On December 27, 1973, His Excellency President [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] signed ''Presidential Decree No. 356'', which established [[Basilan]] Province out of Basilan City and included three municipalities: Lamitan, [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]] and [[Maluso]]. The decree reduced Basilan City's territory to less than a square kilometer. On December 2, 1974, ''Presidential No. 593'' revised 356 to increase the territory of Basilan City to nearly three square kilometers and divide the province into ten municipalities: Lamitan, [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]], [[Maluso]], [[Sumisip]], [[Lantawan]], [[Tuburan, Basilan|Tuburan]], [[Tipo-Tipo]], Tapiantana, Malamawi, and Pilas.

Col. Tomas G. Naquil, commander of the 2/1 Brigade stationed in Basilan at the time, was named the first Military Governor. After nearly two years, Rear Admiral Romulo Espaldon, commander of the South West Command (SOWESCOM), took over as Military Governor, but the affairs of government were managed by a military caretaker, Col. Florencio E. Magsino, who was succeeded by Col. Alfeo Rillera, all Brigade Commanders. This was the situation before His Excellency President Marcos appointed Hon. Asan Camlian, the then-vice governor, was appointed Governor of Basilan Province.

Basilan City was disbanded on December 11, 1975, by virtue of the ''Presidential Decree No. 840'' reduced the number of municipalities of Basilan Province from ten to seven, removing Tapiantana, Pilas, and Malamawi. Pedro C. Pamaran, a member of the provincial board was appointed in 1975, as Municipal Mayor of Lamitan. Furigay succeeded Pamaran in 1980. Wilfredo C. Furigay was considered the first elected mayor of the municipality of Lamitan.

In 1986, during the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], Ramon F. Garcia Jr. was appointed as Mayor during the interim government. By 1988, Wilfredo C. Furigay had taken the position of mayor by way of election and was succeeded by Inocente J. Ramos in 1995 for three consecutive terms.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
{{Hatnote|For further information, see [[League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC]].}}
[[File:Bulingan Falls Lamitan.jpg|thumb|left|Bulingan Falls]]

In 2004, Roderick H. Furigay, a youthful visionary and dynamic entrepreneur, is the nephew of former mayor Wilfredo C. Furigay. Roderick H. Furigay was elected as the Local Chief Executive and served for two terms. He revived the Lamiteños' desire of converting the municipality into a component city.

On June 18, 2007, electorates in Lamitan ratified ''Republic Act No. 9393'' which seeks to convert the town into a component city. There were a total of 26,636 votes voted ''yes'' while only 177 voted against the move.

The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] declared the cityhood law of Lamitan and 15 other cities unconstitutional after a petition filed by the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] in its ruling on November 18, 2008. On December 22, 2009, the cityhood law of Lamitan and 15 other municipalities regain its status as cities again after the court reversed its ruling on November 18, 2008. On August 23, 2010, the court reinstated its ruling on November 18, 2008, causing Lamitan and 15 cities to become regular municipalities. Finally, on February 15, 2011, Lamitan becomes a city again including the 15 municipalities declaring that the conversion to cityhood met all legal requirements.

After six years of legal battle, in its board resolution, the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Lamitan and 15 other cities.

===Contemporary===
In July 2016, the Basilan provincial government broke ground for the construction of the new provincial capitol inside the defunct {{convert|4,000|ha|adj=on}} [[University of the Philippines]] (UP) Land Grant in Barangay Santa Clara.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2016/02/28/1557698/armm-put-new-basilan-capitol|title=ARMM to put up new Basilan capitol|website=[[The Philippine STAR]] }}</ref>

In July 2022, Lamitan gained national attention when former mayor Rose Furigay, who had served as the city's mayor from 2013 to June 2022, was [[assassinated]] in a [[Ateneo de Manila University shooting|mass shooting]] at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] where two others were killed.<ref>{{Cite news |date=July 24, 2022 |title=Former Lamitan mayor, two others killed in Ateneo shooting |work=GMA News |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/metro/839206/pnp-1-killed-1-injured-in-ateneo-shooting/story/ |url-status=live |access-date=July 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220725072008/https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/metro/839206/pnp-1-killed-1-injured-in-ateneo-shooting/story/ |archive-date=July 25, 2022}}</ref>

On June 18, 2024, during the celebration of the city's 17th anniversary, mayor Roderick Furigay highlighted and declared the city free  from the dreaded [[Abu Sayyaf]] in his State of the City Report (SOCR).<ref>{{Cite news |date=June 19, 2024 |title=Lamitan City in Basilan declared free of Abu Sayyaf |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/regions/910493/lamitan-city-in-basilan-declared-free-of-abu-sayyaf/story/ |access-date=June 20, 2024 |work=GMA Integrated News}}</ref> However, several hours after the declaration, a bomb explosion occurred at a gas station located in [[Barangay]] Matibay.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Garcia |first=Teofilo Jr. |date=June 19, 2024 |title=Bomb goes off in Lamitan hours after mayor declares city Abu Sayyaf-free |url=https://www.rappler.com/philippines/mindanao/bomb-goes-off-lamitan-basilan-after-abu-sayyaf-free-declaration/ |access-date=June 20, 2024 |work=Rappler.com}}</ref>
