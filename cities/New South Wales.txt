'''New South Wales''' (commonly abbreviated as '''NSW''') is a [[States and territories of Australia|state]] on the [[Eastern states of Australia|east coast]] of [[:Australia]]. It borders [[Queensland]] to the north, [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]] to the south, and [[South Australia]] to the west. Its coast borders the [[Coral Sea|Coral]] and [[Tasman Sea]]s to the east. The [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Jervis Bay Territory]] are [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within the state. New South Wales' state capital is [[Sydney]], which is also Australia's most populous city.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=20 April 2023 |title=Regional population |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population/latest-release |access-date=23 April 2023 |website=Australian Bureau of Statistics}}</ref> {{As of|2023|12|alt=In December 2023}}, the population of New South Wales was over 8.3&nbsp;million,<ref name=ABSPop/> making it Australia's most populous state. Almost two-thirds of the state's population, 5.3&nbsp;million, live in the Greater Sydney area.<ref name=":1" />

The [[Colony of New South Wales]] was founded as a British [[penal colony]] in 1788. It originally comprised more than half of the [[Australian mainland]] with its [[Western Australia border|western boundary]] set at [[129th meridian east]] in 1825. The colony then also included the island territories of [[Van Diemen's Land]], [[Lord Howe Island]], and [[Norfolk Island]]. During the 19th century, [[Territorial evolution of Australia|most of the colony's area was detached]] to form separate [[British colonies]] that eventually became the various [[states and territories of Australia]]. The [[Swan River Colony]] (later called the [[Colony of Western Australia]]) was never administered as part of New South Wales.

Lord Howe Island remains part of New South Wales, while Norfolk Island became a [[federal territory]], as have the areas now known as the Australian Capital Territory and the [[Jervis Bay Territory]].

=== Aboriginal Australians ===
{{Main|Prehistory of Australia}}
The original inhabitants of New South Wales were the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|tribes]] who arrived in Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. Before European settlement there were an estimated 250,000 Aboriginal people in the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aboriginal settlement|url=http://about.nsw.gov.au/encyclopedia/article/aboriginal-settlement/|publisher=About NSW|access-date=21 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922194236/http://about.nsw.gov.au/encyclopedia/article/aboriginal-settlement/|archive-date=22 September 2013}}</ref>

The [[Wodiwodi|Wodi wodi]] people, who spoke a variant of the [[Tharawal people|Dharawal]] language, are the original custodians of an area south of Sydney which was approximately bounded by modern [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]], [[Shoalhaven River]] and [[Moss Vale]] and included the [[Illawarra]].<ref name="Illawarra">{{cite book|title=History of Aboriginal People of the Illawarra 1770 to 1970|year=2005|publisher=Department of Environment and Conservation, NSW|page=8}}</ref>

The [[Bundjalung people]] are the original custodians of parts of the [[Northern Rivers|northern coastal areas]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}

There are other Aboriginal peoples whose traditional lands are within what is now New South Wales, including the [[Wiradjuri]], [[Gamilaraay|Gamilaray]], [[Yuin]], [[Ngarigo]], [[Gweagal]], and [[Ngiyampaa]] peoples.

In January 1788 [[Arthur Phillip]] arrived in Botany Bay with the [[First Fleet]] of 11 vessels, which carried over a thousand settlers, including 736 convicts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Karskens|first=Grace|title=The Cambridge History of Australia, Volume 1, Indigenous and Colonial Australia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9781107011533|editor-last=Bashford|editor-first=Alison|location=Cambridge|pages=91|chapter=The early colonial presence, 1788-1822|editor-last2=MacIntyre|editor-first2=Stuart}}</ref> A few days after arrival at [[Botany Bay]], the fleet moved to the more suitable [[Port Jackson]], where Phillip established a settlement at the place he named [[Sydney Cove]] (in honour of the Secretary of State, [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Lord Sydney]]) on 26 January 1788.<ref>Peter Hill (2008) p.141-150; Andrew Tink, ''Lord Sydney: The Life and Times of Tommy Townshend,'' Melbourne, Australian Scholarly Publishing, 2011.</ref> This date later became Australia's national day, [[Australia Day]]. Governor Phillip formally proclaimed the colony on 7&nbsp; February 1788 at Sydney. Phillip, as [[Governor of New South Wales]], exercised nominal authority over all of Australia east of the [[135th meridian east]] between the latitudes of 10°37'S and 43°39'S, and "all the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean". The area included modern New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania.<ref name="NAA1787">{{cite web|title=Governor Phillip's Instructions 25 April 1787 (UK)|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195616/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35|archive-date=15 June 2006|access-date=28 May 2006|work=Documenting a Democracy|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]}} Robert J.

The settlement was initially planned to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture. Trade and shipbuilding were banned to keep the convicts isolated. However, after the departure of Governor Phillip, the colony's military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods obtained from visiting ships. Former convicts also farmed land granted to them and engaged in trade. Farms spread to the more fertile lands surrounding [[Parramatta|Paramatta]], [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] and [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], and by 1803 the colony was self-sufficient in grain. Boat building was developed to make travel easier and exploit the marine resources of the coastal settlements. Sealing and whaling became important industries.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Karskens|first=Grace|title=The Cambridge History of Australia, Volume I, Indigenous and colonial Australia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9781107011533|editor-last=Bashford|editor-first=Alison|location=Cambridge|pages=90–114|chapter=The early colonial presence, 1788-1822|editor-last2=MacIntyre|editor-first2=Stuart}}</ref>

From the 1820s, [[Squatting (Australian history)|squatters]] increasingly established unauthorised cattle and sheep runs beyond the official limits of the settled colony. In 1836, an annual licence was introduced in an attempt to control the pastoral industry, but booming wool prices and the high cost of land in the settled areas encouraged further squatting. The expansion of the pastoral industry led to violent episodes of conflict between settlers and traditional Aboriginal landowners, such as the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of 1838.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 19–21</ref> By 1844 wool accounted for half of the colony's exports and by 1850 most of the eastern third of New South Wales was controlled by fewer than 2,000 pastoralists.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Lisa|title=The Cambridge History of Australia, Volume I|last2=Roberts|first2=David Andrew|year=2013|chapter=Expansion, 1821–1850}}</ref>

The transportation of convicts to New South Wales ended in 1840, and in 1842 a Legislative Council was introduced, with two-thirds of its members elected and one-third appointed by the governor. Former convicts were granted the vote, but a property qualification meant that only one in five adult males were enfranchised.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hirst|first=John|title=Australian History in 7 Questions|publisher=Black Inc.|year=2016|isbn=9781922231703 |location=Victoria|pages=51–54}}</ref>

By 1850 the settler population of New South Wales had grown to 180,000, not including the 70,000 living in the area which became the separate colony of Victoria in 1851.<ref>Ford, Lisa; Roberts, David Andrew (2013). p.138</ref>

In 1856 New South Wales achieved [[responsible government]] with the introduction of a bicameral parliament comprising a directly elected [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] and a nominated [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] was prominent in this process, but his proposal for a hereditary upper house was widely ridiculed and subsequently dropped.<ref name="Tink2">{{Cite book |author1=Tink, Andrew |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/28173894 |title=William Charles Wentworth : Australia's greatest native son |date=2009 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-1-74175-192-5}}</ref><ref>Hirst (2016). pp. 56-57</ref>

The property qualification for voters had been reduced in 1851, and by 1856 95 per cent of adult males in Sydney, and 55 per cent in the colony as a whole, were eligible to vote. Full adult male suffrage was introduced in 1858. In 1859 Queensland became a separate colony.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 36, 55–57</ref>

In 1861 the NSW parliament legislated [[Robertson Land Acts|land reforms]] intended to encourage family farms and mixed farming and grazing ventures. The amount of land under cultivation subsequently increased from 246,000 acres in 1861 to 800,000 acres in the 1880s. Wool production also continued to grow, and by the 1880s New South Wales produced almost half of Australia's wool. Coal had been discovered in the early years of settlement and gold in 1851, and by the 1890s wool, gold and coal were the main exports of the colony.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 57, 62, 64, 67</ref>

The NSW economy also became more diversified. From the 1860s, New South Wales had more people employed in manufacturing than any other Australian colony. The NSW government also invested strongly in infrastructure such as railways, telegraph, roads, ports, water and sewerage. By 1889 it was possible to travel by train from Brisbane to Adelaide via Sydney and Melbourne. The extension of the rail network inland also encouraged regional industries and the development of the [[Wheatbelt (Australia)|wheat belt]].<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 63, 76–77, 104</ref>

In the 1880s trade unions grew and were extended to lower skilled workers. In 1890 a strike in the shipping industry spread to wharves, railways, mines, and shearing sheds. The defeat of the strike was one of the factors leading the [[NSW Trades and Labor Council|Trades and Labor Council]] to form a political party. The [[NSW Labor Party|Labor Electoral League]] won a quarter of seats in the NSW elections of 1891 and held the balance of power between the [[Free Trade Party]] and the [[Protectionist Party]].<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 91–94</ref><ref>Hirst, John (2014). pp. 83–86</ref>

The [[suffragette]] movement was developing at this time. The  [[Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales]] was founded in 1891.<ref>{{Citation |last=Godden |first=Judith |title=Pottie, Eliza (1837–1907) |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |url=https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/pottie-eliza-13155 |access-date=27 February 2021 |place=Canberra |publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University}}</ref>

=== 1901—Federation of Australia ===
A [[Federal Council of Australasia]] was formed in 1885 but New South Wales declined to join. A major obstacle to the federation of the Australian colonies was the [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies of Victoria which conflicted with the free trade policies dominant in New South Wales. Nevertheless, the NSW premier [[Henry Parkes]] was a strong advocate of [[Federation of Australia|federation]] and his [[Tenterfield Oration]] in 1889 was pivotal in gathering support for the cause. Parkes also struck a deal with [[Edmund Barton]], leader of the NSW Protectionist Party, whereby they would work together for federation and leave the question of a protective tariff for a future Australian government to decide.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Irving|first=Helen|title=The Cambridge History of Australia, Volume I|year=2013|pages=249–51|chapter=Making the federal Commonwealth}}</ref>

In early 1893 the first citizens' Federation League was established in the Riverina region of New South Wales and many other leagues were soon formed in the colony. The leagues organised a conference in [[Corowa Conference|Corowa]] in July 1893 which developed a plan for federation. The new NSW premier, [[George Reid]], endorsed the "Corowa plan" and in 1895 convinced the majority of other premiers to adopt it. A constitutional convention held sessions in 1897 and 1898 which resulted in a proposed constitution for a Commonwealth of federated states. However, a referendum on the constitution failed to gain the required majority in New South Wales after that colony's Labor party campaigned against it and premier Reid gave it such qualified support that he earned the nickname "yes-no Reid".<ref>Irving, Helen (2013). pp. 257–62</ref>

The premiers of the other colonies agreed to a number of concessions to New South Wales (particularly that the future Commonwealth capital would be located in NSW), and in 1899 further referendums were held in all the colonies except Western Australia. All resulted in yes votes, with the yes vote in New South Wales meeting the required majority. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial Parliament]] passed the necessary enabling legislation in 1900 and Western Australia subsequently voted to join the new federation. The Commonwealth of Australia was inaugurated on 1 January 1901, and Barton was sworn in as Australia's first prime minister.<ref>Irving, Helen (2013). pp. 263–65</ref>

=== 1901 to 1945 ===
[[File:Depression "bread wars", corner store on Riley and Fitzroy Streets, Surry Hills, Sydney, 21 August 1934 - Sam Hood (3705360895).jpg|thumb|left|A corner grocery store during the Great Depression, Riley & Fitzroy Streets, [[Surry Hills]], Sydney, 21 August 1934]]
The first post-federation NSW governments were [[Progressive Party (1901)|Progressive]] or [[Liberal Reform Party (Australia)|Liberal Reform]] and implemented a range of social reforms with Labor support. Women won the [[Women's suffrage in Australia|right to vote]] in NSW elections in 1902, but were ineligible to stand for parliament until 1918. Labor increased its parliamentary representation in every election from 1904 before coming to power in 1910 with a majority of one seat.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Croucher|first=John S.|title=A Concise History of New South Wales|publisher=Woodslane Press|year=2020|isbn=9781925868395|location=NSW|pages=128}}</ref><ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 110. 118-19</ref>

The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 saw more NSW volunteers for service than the federal authorities could handle, leading to unrest in camps as recruits waited for transfer overseas. In 1916 NSW premier [[William Holman]] and a number of his supporters were expelled from the Labor party over their support for military conscription. Holman subsequently formed a [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist]] government which remained in power until 1920. Despite a huge victory for Holman's pro-conscription Nationalists in the elections of March 1917, a second referendum on conscription held in December that year was defeated in New South Wales and nationally.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 122–25</ref>

Following the war, NSW governments embarked on large public works programs including road building, the extension and electrification of the rail network and the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The works were largely funded by loans from London, leading to a debt crisis after the onset of the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]] in 1929. New South Wales was hit harder by the depression than other states, and by 1932 one third of union members in the state were unemployed, compared with 20 per cent nationally.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 132, 142</ref>

Labor won the November 1930 NSW elections and [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] became premier for the second time. In 1931 Lang proposed a plan to deal with the depression which included a suspension of interest payments to British creditors, diverting the money to unemployment relief. The Commonwealth and state premiers rejected the plan and later that year Lang's supporters in the Commonwealth parliament brought down [[James Scullin|James Scullin's]] federal Labor government. The NSW Lang government subsequently defaulted on overseas interest payments and was dismissed from office in May 1932 by the governor, [[Philip Game|Sir Phillip Game]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bongiorno|first=Frank|title=The Cambridge History of Australia, Volume 2|year=2013|pages=79–81|chapter=Search for a solution, 1923–39}}</ref><ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 148–49</ref>

The following elections were won comfortably by the United Australia Party in coalition with the Country Party. [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]] became premier, remaining in office until 1939, when he was replaced by [[Alexander Mair]].<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 151, 157</ref>

A contemporary study by sociologist A. P. Elkin found that the population of New South Wales responded to the outbreak of war in 1939 with pessimism and apathy. This changed with the threat of invasion by Japan, which entered the war in December 1941. In May 1942 three Japanese midget submarines entered Sydney harbour and sank a naval ship, killing 29 men aboard. The following month Sydney and Newcastle were shelled by Japanese warships. American troops began arriving in the state in large numbers. Manufacturing, steelmaking, shipbuilding and rail transport all grew with the war effort and unemployment virtually disappeared.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 157–58</ref>

A Labor government led by [[William McKell]] was elected in May 1941. The McKell government benefited from full employment, budget surpluses, and a co-operative relationship with John Curtin's federal Labor government. McKell became the first Labor leader to serve a full term and to be re-elected for a second. The Labor party was to govern New South Wales until 1965.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 161–62</ref>

=== Post-war period ===
The Labor government introduced two weeks of annual paid leave for most NSW workers in 1944, and the 40-hour working week was implemented by 1947. The post-war economic boom brought near-full employment and rising living standards, and the government engaged in large spending programs on housing, dams, electricity generation and other infrastructure. In 1954 the government announced a plan for the construction of an opera house on [[Bennelong Point]]. The design competition was won by [[Jørn Utzon]]. Controversy over the cost of the [[Sydney Opera House]] and construction delays became a political issue and was a factor in the eventual defeat of Labor in 1965 by the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] coalition led by [[Robert Askin]].<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 156, 162, 168–75, 184–86</ref>

The Askin government promoted private development, law and order issues and greater state support for non-government schools. However, Askin, a former bookmaker, became increasingly associated with illegal bookmaking, gambling and police corruption.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 188, 193, 196–98</ref>

In the late 1960s, a [[New England New State Movement|secessionist movement]] in the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] region of the state led to a 1967 referendum on the issue which was narrowly defeated. The new state would have consisted of much of northern NSW including [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rhodes|first=Campbell|date=27 October 2017|title=Breaking up is hard to do: secession in Australia|url=https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do-secession-in-australia/|access-date=8 June 2021|website=Museum of Australian Democracy|archive-date=8 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210608035427/https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do-secession-in-australia/|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Sydney_Opera_House_-_Dec_2008.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Sydney Opera House]] was completed in 1973 and has become a World Heritage Site.]]
Askin's resignation in 1975 was followed by a number of short-lived premierships by Liberal Party leaders. When a general election came in 1976, the ALP under [[Neville Wran]] came to power.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Parliament of New South Wales, Legislative Assembly election: Election of 1 May 1976|url=https://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=758|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804190053/https://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=758|archive-date=4 August 2020|access-date=15 May 2020|website=Australian Politics and Elections Archive 1856–2018|publisher=University of Western Australia}}</ref> Wran was able to transform this narrow one seat victory into landslide wins (known as Wranslides) in 1978 and 1981.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Wran era|date=2006|publisher=Federation Press|last=Bramston|first=Troy|isbn=1-86287-600-2|location=Leichhardt, N.S.W.|pages=31|oclc=225332582}}</ref>

After winning a comfortable though reduced majority in 1984, Wran resigned as premier and left parliament. His replacement [[Barrie Unsworth]] struggled to emerge from Wran's shadow and lost a 1988 election against a resurgent Liberal Party led by [[Nick Greiner]]. The Greiner government embarked on an efficiency program involving public sector cost-cutting, the corporatisation of government agencies and the privatisation of some government services. An [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC) was created.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 231–34</ref> Greiner called a snap election in 1991 which the Liberals were expected to win. However the ALP polled extremely well and the Liberals lost their majority and needed the support of independents to retain power.

In 1992, Greiner was investigated by ICAC for possible corruption over the offer of a public service position to a former Liberal MP. Greiner resigned but was later cleared of corruption. His replacement as Liberal leader and Premier was [[John Fahey (politician)|John Fahey]], whose government narrowly lost the 1995 election to the ALP under [[Bob Carr]], who was to become the longest serving premier of the state.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 234–238</ref>

The Carr government (1995–2005) largely continued its predecessors' focus on the efficient delivery of government services such as health, education, transport and electricity. There was an increasing emphasis on public-private partnerships to deliver infrastructure such as freeways, tunnels and rail links. The Carr government gained popularity for its successful organisation of international events, especially the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but Carr himself was critical of the federal government over its high immigration intake, arguing that a disproportionate number of new migrants were settling in Sydney, putting undue pressure on state infrastructure.<ref>Kingston, Beverley (2006). pp. 238, 241–46</ref>

Carr unexpectedly resigned from office in 2005 and was replaced by [[Morris Iemma]], who remained premier after being re-elected in the [[2007 New South Wales state election|March 2007 state election]], until he was replaced by [[Nathan Rees]] in September 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Benson|first1=Simon|last2=Hildebrand|first2=Joe|date=5 September 2008|title=Nathan Rees new NSW premier after Morris Iemma quits|work=[[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24298162-952,00.html|url-status=live|access-date=13 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914081625/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24298162-952,00.html|archive-date=14 September 2008}}</ref> Rees was subsequently replaced by [[Kristina Keneally]] in December 2009, who became the first female premier of New South Wales.<ref name="Herald Sun">{{cite news|date=4 December 2009|title=Keneally sworn in as state's first female premier|work=Herald Sun|location=Australia|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/keneally-sworn-in-as-states-first-female-premier/story-e6frf7jx-1225806991122|url-status=live|access-date=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725114509/https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/keneally-sworn-in-as-states-first-female-premier/story-e6frf7jx-1225806991122?nk=f1a92a0100e75e86eb81a6a8fa0ca23b-1595677509|archive-date=25 July 2020}}</ref> Keneally's government was defeated at the [[2011 New South Wales state election|2011 state election]] and [[Barry O'Farrell]] became Premier on 28 March.

New South Wales is bordered on the north by Queensland, on the west by South Australia, on the south by Victoria and on the east by the [[Coral Sea|Coral]] and [[Tasman Sea]]s. The [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] form a separately administered entity that is bordered entirely by New South Wales. The state can be divided geographically into four areas. New South Wales's three largest cities, [[Sydney]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Wollongong]], lie near the centre of a narrow coastal strip extending from cool temperate areas on the far south coast to [[subtropical]] areas near the Queensland border. [[Gulaga National Park]] in the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]] features the southernmost [[subtropical rainforest]] in the state.<ref>[https://rune.une.edu.au/web/bitstream/1959.11/13719/6/open/SOURCE04.pdf Rainforest In Southern New South Wales] by the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]]. Retrieved 11 August 2023.</ref>

The [[Illawarra]] region is centred on the city of Wollongong, with the [[Shoalhaven]], [[Eurobodalla]] and the [[Sapphire Coast]] to the south. The [[Central Coast, New South Wales|Central Coast]] lies between Sydney and Newcastle, with the [[Mid North Coast]] and [[Northern Rivers]] regions reaching northwards to the Queensland border. Tourism is important to the economies of coastal towns such as [[Coffs Harbour]], [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]] and [[Port Macquarie]], but the region also produces seafood, beef, dairy, fruit, sugar cane and timber.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Agriculture Industry Snapshot for Planning: Illawarra/Shoalhaven Region |url=https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/1260489/Illawarra-Shoalhaven-Snapshot.pdf |website=NSW Department of Primary Industries}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Agricultural adjustments in the Illawarra region |url=https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=wollgeo |website=University of Wollongong}}</ref>

[[File:My Favourite Valley - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]]]]
The [[Great Dividing Range]] extends from Victoria in the south through New South Wales to Queensland, parallel to the narrow coastal plain. This area includes the [[Snowy Mountains]], the [[Northern Tablelands, New South Wales|Northern]], [[Central Tablelands|Central]] and [[Southern Tablelands]], the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] and the [[South West Slopes (New South Wales)|South West Slopes]]. Whilst not particularly steep, many peaks of the range rise above {{Convert|1000|m|ft|0}}, with the highest [[Mount Kosciuszko]] at {{Convert|2229|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. [[Skiing in Australia]] began in this region at [[Kiandra]] around 1861. The relatively short ski season underwrites the tourist industry in the [[Snowy Mountains]]. Agriculture, particularly the wool industry, is important throughout the highlands. Major centres include [[Armidale]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Bowral]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[Inverell]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Queanbeyan]] and [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]].{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

There are numerous forests in New South Wales, with such tree species as Red Gum [[Eucalyptus]] and Crow Ash (''[[Flindersia|Flindersia australis]]''), being represented.<ref>Joseph Henry Maiden. 1908. ''The Forest Flora of New South Wales'', v. 3, Australian Government Printing Office.</ref> Forest floors have a diverse set of understory shrubs and fungi.

The [[Southeast Australia temperate savanna|western slopes and plains]] fill a significant portion of the state's area and have a much sparser population than areas nearer the coast. Agriculture is central to the economy of the western slopes, particularly the [[Riverina]] region and [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]] in the state's south-west. Regional cities such as [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], [[Dubbo]], [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] and [[Wagga Wagga]] and towns such as [[Deniliquin]], [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]] and [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]] exist primarily to service these agricultural regions. The western slopes descend slowly to the western plains that comprise almost two-thirds of the state and are largely arid or semi-arid. The mining town of [[Broken Hill]] is the largest centre in this area.<ref>Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol. 7, Grolier Society.</ref>

One possible definition of the centre for New South Wales is located {{Convert|33|km|mi|0}} west-north-west of [[Tottenham, New South Wales|Tottenham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/centre.htm |title=Geoscience Australia&nbsp;– Center of Australia, States and Territories |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822124000/https://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/centre.htm |archive-date=22 August 2008 }}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:New South Wales Köppen.svg|thumb|left|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in New South Wales]]
A little more than half of the state has an [[arid]] to [[semi arid]] climate, where the rainfall averages from {{convert|150|to|500|mm}} a year throughout most of this climate zone. Summer temperatures can be very hot, while winter nights can be quite cold in this region. Rainfall varies throughout the state. The far north-west receives the least, less than {{Convert|180|mm|abbr=on|0}} annually, while the east receives between {{Convert|700|and|1400|mm|abbr=on|0}} of rain.<ref name="NSWclimate">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/sevwx/facts/stormy-weather.pdf |title=Stormy Weather |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |access-date=16 May 2014 |archive-date=20 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920170035/http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/sevwx/facts/stormy-weather.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The climate along the flat, [[coastal plain]] east of the range varies from [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] in the south to [[humid subtropical]] in the northern half of the state, right above [[Wollongong]]. Rainfall is highest in this area; however, it still varies from around {{convert|800|mm}} to as high as {{convert|3000|mm}} in the wettest areas, for example [[Dorrigo, New South Wales|Dorrigo]]. In the state's south, on the westward side of the [[Great Dividing Range]], rainfall is heaviest in winter due to [[cold front]]s which move across [[southern Australia]], while in the north, around [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], rain is heaviest in summer from tropical systems and occasionally even [[tropical cyclone|cyclones]].<ref name="NSWclimate"/> During late winter, the coastal plain is relatively dry due to [[Southeast Australian foehn|foehn winds]] that originate from the Great Dividing Range;<ref>Sharples, J.J.

The climate in the southern half of the state is generally warm to hot in summer and cool in the winter. The seasons are more defined in the southern half of the state, especially as one moves inland towards [[South West Slopes]], [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]] and the [[Riverina]] region. The climate in the [[Northern Rivers|northeast region]] of the state, or the [[New South Wales North Coast|North Coast]], bordering [[Queensland]], is hot and humid in the summer and mild in winter. The [[Northern Tablelands]], which are also on the North coast, have relatively mild summers and cold winters, due to their high elevation on the Great Dividing Range.

Peaks along the Great Dividing Range vary from {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} to over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0}} above sea level. Temperatures can be cool to cold in winter with frequent [[frost]]s and [[snowfall]], and are rarely hot in summer due to the elevation. [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] has a climate typical of the range, as do the regional cities of [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Cooma]], [[Oberon, New South Wales|Oberon]] and [[Armidale]]. Such places fall within the [[subtropical highland]] (''Cwb'') variety. Rainfall is moderate in this area, ranging from {{convert|600|to|800|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}.

Snowfall is common in the higher parts of the range, sometimes occurring as far north as the [[Queensland]] border. On the highest peaks of the [[Snowy Mountains]], the climate can be [[Oceanic climate#Subpolar variety (Cfc, Cwc)|subpolar oceanic]] and even [[alpine climate|alpine]] on the higher peaks with very cold temperatures and heavy snow. The [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], [[Southern Tablelands]] and [[Central Tablelands]], which are situated on the Great Dividing Range, have mild to warm summers and cold winters, although not as severe as those in the Snowy Mountains.<ref name="NSWclimate"/>

The highest maximum temperature recorded was {{Convert|49.7|°C|°F|0}} at [[Menindee, New South Wales|Menindee]] in the west of the state on 10 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was {{Convert|-23|°C|°F|0}} at [[Charlotte Pass, New South Wales|Charlotte Pass]] in the Snowy Mountains on 29 June 1994. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia excluding the Antarctic Territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf|title=Rainfall and Temperature Records: National|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|access-date=14 November 2009|archive-date=27 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327211715/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Government ==
{{Main|Government of New South Wales}}
[[File:Parliament house sydney nsw..jpg|thumb|New South Wales [[Parliament House, Sydney|Parliament House]] in Sydney, the oldest public building in Australia]]
Executive power is formally exercised by the Executive Council, which consists of the Governor and senior ministers.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Executive Council |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/about/Pages/The-Executive-Council.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201020146/https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/about/Pages/The-Executive-Council.aspx |archive-date=1 February 2018 |access-date=31 January 2018 |work=Parliament of New South Wales}}</ref> The current governor is [[Margaret Beazley]]. The governor commissions as premier the leader of the parliamentary political party that can command a simple majority of votes in the Legislative Assembly. The premier then recommends the appointment of other members of the two Houses to the Ministry, under the principle of responsible or [[Westminster system|Westminster government]]. As in other Westminster systems, there is no constitutional requirement in New South Wales for the government to be formed from the parliament—merely convention. As of early July 2023, the premier is [[Chris Minns]] of the [[Labor Party of Australia|Labor Party]].

=== Constitution ===
{{wikisource|Constitution of New South Wales}}
The form of the Government of New South Wales is prescribed in its Constitution, dating from 1856 and currently the ''[[Constitution Act 1902]]'' (NSW).<ref>{{cite web |title=Constitution Act 1902 No 32 |publisher=NSW Government |url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+32+1902+cd+0+N |access-date=30 December 2013 |archive-date=4 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904005533/http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+32+1902+cd+0+N |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 1901 New South Wales has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth.

In 2006, the Constitution Amendment [[Pledge of Loyalty Act 2006]] No 6,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/caola2006n6460.pdf |website= AustLII |title=New South Wales Constitution Amendment (Pledge of Loyalty) Act 2006 No 6|access-date=15 March 2016 |archive-date=25 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925071147/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/caola2006n6460.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> was enacted to amend the NSW Constitution Act 1902 to require Members of the New South Wales Parliament and its Ministers to take a pledge of loyalty to Australia and to the people of New South Wales instead of swearing allegiance to [[Elizabeth II]] her heirs and successors, and to revise the oaths taken by Executive Councillors. The Pledge of Loyalty Act was officially assented to by the Queen on 3 April 2006. The option to swear allegiance to the Queen was restored as an alternative option in June 2012.

Under the Australian Constitution, New South Wales ceded certain legislative and judicial powers to the Commonwealth, but retained independence in all other areas. The New South Wales Constitution says: "The Legislature shall, subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, have power to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever".<ref>Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), section 5.</ref>

The first [[Responsible government|responsible]] self-government of New South Wales was formed on 6 June 1856 with [[Stuart Donaldson|Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson]] appointed by Governor [[William Denison|Sir William Denison]] as its first [[Chief Secretary (British Empire)|Colonial Secretary]] which in those days accounted also as the [[Premier]].<ref>Government Gazette June 1856</ref> The [[Parliament of New South Wales]] is composed of the Sovereign and two houses: the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] (lower house), and the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (upper house). Elections are held every four years on the fourth Saturday of March, the [[2019 New South Wales state election|most recent]] being on 23 March 2019. At each election one member is elected to the Legislative Assembly from each of 93 [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly electoral districts|electoral districts]] and half of the 42 members of the Legislative Council are elected by a statewide electorate.

=== Local government ===
New South Wales is divided into 128 [[Local government areas of New South Wales|local government areas]]. There is also the [[Unincorporated Far West Region]] which is not part of any local government area, in the sparsely inhabited [[Far West, New South Wales|Far West]], and [[Lord Howe Island]], which is also [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] but self-governed by the Lord Howe Island Board.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

=== Emergency services ===
New South Wales is policed by the [[New South Wales Police Force]], a [[statutory authority]]. Established in 1862, the New South Wales Police Force investigates Summary and Indictable offences throughout the State of New South Wales. The state has two fire services: the volunteer based [[New South Wales Rural Fire Service]], which is responsible for the majority of the state, and the [[Fire and Rescue NSW]], a government agency responsible for protecting urban areas. There is some overlap in due to suburbanisation. Ambulance services are provided through the [[New South Wales Ambulance]]. Rescue services (i.e. vertical, road crash, confinement) are a joint effort by all emergency services, with Ambulance Rescue, Police Rescue Squad and Fire Rescue Units contributing. Volunteer rescue organisations include Marine Rescue New South Wales, [[New South Wales State Emergency Service|State Emergency Service]] (SES), [[Surf Life Saving Australia|Surf Life Saving NSW]] and [[Volunteer Rescue Association]] (VRA).{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

=== Primary and Secondary ===
[[File:St Stanislaus' College-Bathurst NSW.jpg|thumb|[[St Stanislaus' College (Bathurst)|St Stanislaus' College]] is a [[Secondary school|secondary]] [[Day school|day]] and [[boarding school]] in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]]]]
The NSW school system comprises a kindergarten to year 12 system with primary schooling up to year 6 and secondary schooling between years 7 and 12. Schooling is compulsory from before 6 years old until the age of 17 (unless Year 10 is completed earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea1990104/s21b.html|title=EDUCATION ACT 1990 – SECT 21B Compulsory school-age|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=23 November 2017|archive-date=14 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114053718/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea1990104/s21b.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Between 1943 and 2009, schooling was only compulsory in NSW until age 15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-28/not-so-fast-minimum-leaving-age-raised/275344|title=Not so fast: minimum leaving age raised|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=23 November 2017|date=27 January 2009|archive-date=18 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418202934/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-28/not-so-fast-minimum-leaving-age-raised/275344|url-status=live}}</ref>

Primary and secondary schools include government and non-government schools. Government schools are further classified as comprehensive and [[Selective school (New South Wales)|selective schools]]. Non-government schools include Catholic schools, other denominational schools, and non-denominational independent schools.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

Typically, a primary school provides education from kindergarten level to year 6. A secondary school, usually called a "high school", provides education from years 7 to 12. [[College|Secondary colleges]] are secondary schools which only cater for years 11 and 12.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

The [[New South Wales Education Standards Authority|NSW Education Standards Authority]] classifies the 13 years of primary and secondary schooling into six stages, beginning with Early Stage 1 (Kindergarten) and ending with Stage 6 (years 11 and 12).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://syllabus.nesa.nsw.edu.au/stages/|title=STAGES|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=23 November 2017|archive-date=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030619/https://syllabus.nesa.nsw.edu.au/stages/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/parents/parent-guide/schooling-in-nsw|title=Schooling in NSW|website=educationstandards.nsw.edu.au|access-date=23 November 2017|archive-date=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803192308/http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/parents/parent-guide/schooling-in-nsw|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Record of School Achievement ====
{{Main|Record of School Achievement}}

A Record of School Achievement (RoSA) is awarded by the [[New South Wales Education Standards Authority|NSW Education Standards Authority]] to students who have completed at least Year 10 but leave school without completing the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea1990104/s94.html|title=EDUCATION ACT 1990 – SECT 94 Record of School Achievement|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=23 November 2017|archive-date=21 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521010840/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea1990104/s94.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The RoSA was introduced in 2012 to replace the former [[School Certificate (New South Wales)|School Certificate]].

==== Higher School Certificate ====
{{Main|Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)}}
The Higher School Certificate (HSC) is the usual Year 12 leaving certificate in NSW. The HSC is the most popular high school credential in Australia with 75,493 students studying one or more HSC courses in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |date= 3 October 2023|title=2022 HSC students overview |url=https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/hsc/about-HSC/HSC-facts-figures/overview-HSC-students |website=NSW Education Standards Authority}}</ref> Most students complete the HSC prior to entering the workforce or going on to study at university or [[TAFE]] (although the HSC itself can be completed at TAFE). The HSC must be completed for a student to get an [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] (formerly [[Universities Admission Index]]), which determines the student's rank against fellow students who completed the Higher School Certificate.

=== Tertiary ===
[[File:Usydcampuspicture.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[University of Sydney]] is Australia's oldest university.]]
Eleven universities primarily operate in New South Wales. Sydney is home to Australia's first university, the [[University of Sydney]] founded in 1850. Other universities include the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Macquarie University]], [[University of Technology, Sydney]] and [[Western Sydney University]]. The [[Australian Catholic University]] has three of its seven campuses in Sydney, and the private [[University of Notre Dame Australia]] also operates a secondary campus in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dame |first=Notre |date=6 June 2018 |title=Sydney Campus |url=https://www.notredame.edu.au/about/campuses/sydney-campus |access-date=19 June 2023 |website=Notre Dame |language=en}}</ref>

Outside Sydney, the leading universities are the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] and the [[University of Wollongong]]. Armidale is home to the [[University of New England, Australia|University of New England]], and [[Charles Sturt University]].

[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge - December 2018.jpg|thumb|The [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] is an important tourist attraction for New South Wales.]]
NSW is the largest state economy in Australia, with service industries contributing almost 80% of the state's economic activity and 90% of its employment. Business services which includes financial services; professional, scientific and technical services; property services; information media; and telecommunications, account for nearly a third of the state economy. Major merchandise exports include coal, copper, beef and aluminium.

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in New South Wales}}
Passage through New South Wales is vital for cross-continent transport. Rail and road traffic from Brisbane (Queensland) to [[Perth]] (Western Australia), or to Melbourne (Victoria) must pass through New South Wales.

=== Railways ===

The majority of railways in New South Wales are currently operated by the state government. Some lines began as branch-lines of railways starting in other states. For instance, [[Balranald]] near the Victorian border was connected by a rail line coming up from Victoria and into New South Wales. Another line beginning in Adelaide crossed over the border and stopped at Broken Hill.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

Railways management are conducted by [[Sydney Trains]] and [[NSW TrainLink]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/nswtrains |title=Transport for New South Wales |publisher=Transport for New South Wales |access-date=10 July 2013 |archive-date=9 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709050931/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/nswtrains |url-status=live }}</ref> which maintain rolling stock. Sydney Trains operates trains within Sydney while NSW TrainLink operates outside Sydney, intercity, country and interstate services.

Both Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink have their main terminus at Sydney's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]]. NSW TrainLink regional and long-distance services consist of [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] services to [[Grafton railway station, New South Wales|Grafton]], [[Casino railway station|Casino]], [[Roma Street railway station|Brisbane]], [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]] and [[Dubbo railway station|Dubbo]], as well as [[New South Wales Xplorer|Xplorer]] services to [[Canberra railway station|Canberra]], [[Griffith railway station|Griffith]], [[Broken Hill railway station|Broken Hill]], [[Armidale railway station|Armidale]] and [[Moree railway station|Moree]].

Major roads are the concern of both federal and state governments. The latter maintains these through the [[Transport for NSW]] agency.

The main roads in New South Wales are
* [[Hume Highway]] linking Sydney to [[Melbourne]], Victoria
* [[Princes Highway]] linking Sydney to Melbourne via the Tasman Sea coast
* [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]] linking Sydney to [[Brisbane]], Queensland via the Pacific coast
* [[New England Highway]] running from the Pacific Highway, at Newcastle to Brisbane by an inland route
* [[Federal Highway, Australia|Federal Highway]] running from the Hume Highway south of [[Goulburn]] to [[Canberra]], Australian Capital Territory
* [[Sturt Highway]] running from the Hume Highway near [[Gundagai]] to [[Adelaide]], South Australia
* [[Newell Highway]] linking rural Victoria with Queensland, passing through the centre of New South Wales
* [[Great Western Highway]] linking Sydney with [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], as Route 32 it continues west as the [[Mitchell Highway]] then as the [[Barrier Highway]] to Adelaide via [[Broken Hill]]

Other roads are usually the concern of the TfNSW or the [[Local government in New South Wales|local government authority]].
