'''Waterloo''' is a city in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]]. It is one of three cities in the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo]] (formerly [[Waterloo County, Ontario|Waterloo County]]). Waterloo is situated about {{convert|94|km|abbr=on}} west-southwest of [[Toronto]], but it is not considered to be part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA). Due to the close proximity of the city of [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] to Waterloo, the two together are often referred to as "Kitchener–Waterloo", "K-W", or "The Twin Cities".

While several unsuccessful attempts to combine the municipalities of Kitchener and Waterloo have been made, following the 1973 establishment of the Region of Waterloo, less motivation to do so existed, and as a result, Waterloo remains an independent city. At the time of the [[Canada 2021 Census|2021 census]], the population of Waterloo was 121,436.<ref name="CensusProfile2021CompareCMA" />

==History==
=== Indigenous peoples and settlement ===
[[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] such as the [[Haudenosaunee|Iroquois]], [[Anishinaabe]] and [[Neutral Nation|Chonnonton]] lived in the area.<ref name=WaterlooHistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.waterloo.ca/en/things-to-do/waterloo_s-history.aspx|title=Waterloo's history|date=March 8, 2021 |access-date=29 March 2021|archive-date=April 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429090948/https://www.waterloo.ca/en/things-to-do/waterloo_s-history.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the end of the [[American Revolution]], [[Joseph Brant]], a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] war chief, wanted [[Frederick Haldimand]] to give the Mohawk and [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Six Nations]] a tract of land surrounding the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], in return for their loyalty to the British in the war.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=18–19}}<ref name=":11">{{cite web |title=Haldimand Proclamation, The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/haldimand-proclamation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805214208/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/haldimand-proclamation |archive-date=August 5, 2019 |access-date=August 27, 2019}}</ref> Haldimand's 1784 ''[[Haldimand Proclamation]]'' granted the land "six miles deep from either side of the [Grand River] beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the very head of the said river."{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=18–19}}<ref name=":11" /> Haldimand, who had previously ordered for potential mill sites to be identified in the region, decreed in 1788 that mill sites would be included in the grant (which would not have been included otherwise).{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=15}} In 1796, [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]] purchased Block Number 2 of the grant from [[Joseph Brant]] (on behalf of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Six Nations]]) with a mortgage held by the Six Nations.<ref name=":12" /> Block 2, 94,012 acres in size, was situated in the District of Gore.

Many of the pioneers who arrived from Pennsylvania after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre tract of Block 2 from the German Company of Pennsylvania. The tract included almost two-thirds of Block 2. Many of the first farms were least 400 acres in size.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1930 |website=Waterloo Historical Society 1930 Annual Meeting |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society |access-date=13 March 2017 |archive-date=February 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233215/http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Development (19th century) ===
The Mennonites divided the land into smaller lots; two lots owned by [[Abraham Erb]]—who is often called the founder of the Village of Waterloo{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=16}}—became the central core of Waterloo. Erb had come to the area in 1806 from Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=15}} He had bought {{Convert|4000|acre}} from the German Company Tract and settled where there was enough water power to operate mills.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=15}} He founded a [[sawmill]] in 1808 and [[Gristmill|grist mill]] in 1816; they saw business flourish.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=16}} Other early settlers of what would become Waterloo included Samuel and Elia Schneider, who arrived in 1816.

[[File:First School in Waterloo, Ontario (1820).jpg|thumb|The first schoolhouse in Waterloo, built in 1820]]

The first school in what is now the City of Waterloo was built on land donated by Erb; the log building was constructed in 1820. A larger school house of stone was built in 1842 and was replaced with a brick school building in 1852. Over the decades, the log building was moved, eventually to [[Waterloo Park]], where it still stands.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://waterlooheritage.com/2014/06/01/the-legacy-of-the-1820-log-schoolhouse-part-ii/ |title=The Legacy of the 1820 Log Schoolhouse: Part II |date=1 June 2014 |work=Waterloo Heritage News |access-date=19 May 2021 |quote= |archive-date=May 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519144811/https://waterlooheritage.com/2014/06/01/the-legacy-of-the-1820-log-schoolhouse-part-ii/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The German spoken in Waterloo County is based upon the 18th century Pennsylvania Dutch dialect.{{sfn|Kraemer|2003|p=36}} In turn, the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect is based upon the dialect of German spoken in southwestern Germany.{{sfn|Kraemer|2003|p=36}}

In 1816, the new Waterloo Township was officially incorporated while being named after [[Waterloo, Belgium]], the site of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815), which had ended the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in Europe.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/en/collections-and-research/waterloo-township.aspx | title=History of Waterloo Township | access-date=August 27, 2019 | archive-date=July 27, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727143149/https://www.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/en/collections-and-research/waterloo-township.aspx | url-status=live }}</ref> After that war, the new township became a popular destination for German immigrants. By the 1840s, German settlers had overtaken the Mennonites as the dominant segment of the population. Many Germans settled in the small hamlet to the southeast of Waterloo. In their honour, the village was named Berlin in 1833 ([[Berlin to Kitchener name change|renamed]] to [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] in 1916). The first Catholic family to arrive were the Spetz family from Alsace who came in 1828.{{sfn|Kraemer|2003|p=76}}

By 1831, Waterloo had a small post office in the King and Erb Street area, operated by Daniel Snyder, some 11 years before one would open in neighbouring Berlin.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/7165738-flash-from-the-past-tracking-waterloo-s-mail/|title=Flash from the Past: Tracking Waterloo's mail|first=Rych|last=Mills|date=March 6, 2017|newspaper=Waterloo Region Record|access-date=June 12, 2017|archive-date=March 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308160603/http://www.therecord.com/living-story/7165738-flash-from-the-past-tracking-waterloo-s-mail/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Bloomfield|1995|p=76}} The ''Smith's Canadian Gazetteer'' of 1846 states that the Township of Waterloo (smaller than Waterloo County) consisted primarily of Pennsylvanian Mennonites and immigrants directly from Germany who had brought money with them. At the time, many did not speak English. There were eight grist and twenty sawmills in the township. In 1841, the population count was 4424. In 1846 the village of Waterloo had a population of 200, "mostly Germans". There was a grist mill and a sawmill and some tradesmen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

McKay company of Australia proposed to open a factory for "one, man, self-propelled combine harvesters".{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=84}} The town provided the land for the factory from the Canada Barrels and Kegs and fixed the tax assessment at $25, 000 per year for the next 10 years in exchange for the factory being built.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=84}}> In 1911, Waterloo Lutheran seminary, which later became Wilfrid Laurier University, was opened.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=61}} On 5 May 1916, a group of soldiers sacked the German Acadian Club in Waterloo.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=63}} In October 1918, Spanish flu reached Waterloo.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=69}} Over 2, 000 people were "down with the malady".{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=69}} By November 1918, the Waterloo Chronicle reported that "twice as many had died from the influenza as had been killed in action in four years of war".{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=69}}

The presence of the [[University of Waterloo]] in the city caused technological and innovative companies to base in Waterloo,{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=171}} especially companies specializing in computing and [[software]]. For example, [[BlackBerry Limited|Research in Motion]] (now BlackBerry Limited), which developed [[BlackBerry]], was started by [[Mike Lazaridis]] and [[Douglas Fregin|Doug Fregin]] in 1984.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=174}} In 1965, the University of Waterloo was the second-largest private sector employer.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=139}} The construction of the buildings for the University of Waterloo made the unemployment rate very low in the 1960s.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=140}} By 1971, the population of Waterloo had grown 424% since 1945.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=140}} Kitchener was a working class city while Waterloo was a middle class city.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=141}} In 1981, the average annual household income in Kitchener was $26, 279 and in Waterloo was $31, 224.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=141}} In 1950, Waterloo had 55 factories that employed 2, 572 people, in 1970 had 79 factories that employed $5, 483 workers, and in 1980 132 factories that employed 7, 314 workers.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=141}} The founding of the universities led to the north-eastern area becoming developed as the new housing subdivisions were built while the area around Weber declined.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|pp=141–143}} The architecture of Waterloo changed from a more traditional [[Victorian architecture]] style to favouring a more streamlined look, incorporating elements from architectural styles such as [[Postmodern architecture]], which ultimately led to a movement to preserve Waterloo's historical core.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=143}} A 1994 issue of the ''[[Financial Post]]'' mentioned Waterloo-based companies [[MKS Inc.|MKS]], [[Watcom|WATCOM]], and [[OpenText|Open Text]] in a list of the top 100 independent software companies in Canada.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=174}} In 1960, a study revealed 50% of the buying by Waterloo consumers was done in Kitchener, leading to the city to develop a retail district.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|pp=109–111}}

In the 1980s, Waterloo came to have the character of a "post-industrial city".{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=144}} Mennonite farmers continued to come to Waterloo in their horse-powered buggies for shopping while the middle class people drove out to eat and drink at the numerous pubs and hotels out in the countryside.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|1990|p=144}}

In June 2011, the Waterloo Region council approved the [[Ion rapid transit|Ion]]: a [[light rail]] transit line connecting Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo and Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener.<ref>{{cite web |date=2011-06-15 |title=Rail plan passes |url=http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312025134/http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |access-date=2012-02-20 |publisher=TheRecord}}</ref> Construction on the Ion began in August 2014.

==Geography==
[[Image:Waterloo uptown.jpg|thumb|right|King Street South in Uptown Waterloo]]Waterloo's city centre is near the intersection of [[King Street (Waterloo Region)|King]] and Erb streets. The city centre was once along Albert Street, near the Marsland Centre and the [[Waterloo Public Library]]. The town hall, fire hall, and farmers' market were located there. Amidst some controversy, all were demolished between 1965 and 1969.

Historically, Waterloo's swamp land near where the village was first developed caused problems for development.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=15}} To mitigate these issues, sand was taken from nearby areas to raise the land; buildings were built on foundations of oak planks; and [[King Street (Waterloo Region)|King Street]] was originally built as a [[corduroy road]].{{Sfn|McLaughlin|Jaeger|2007|pp=16}}

===Waterways===
[[File:Grand River north of Waterloo.png|thumb|The [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], as seen to the north-east of Waterloo]]
The [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] flows southward along the city's east side. Its most significant tributary within the city is Laurel Creek, whose [[Sunfish Lake (Ontario)|source]] lies just to the west of the city limits and its mouth just to the east, and crosses much of the city's central areas, including the University of Waterloo lands and Waterloo Park; it flows under the uptown area in a culvert. In the city's west end, the [[Waterloo Moraine]] provides over 300,000 people in the region with drinking water. Much of the gently hilly Waterloo Moraine underlies existing developed areas. Ongoing urban growth, mostly low-density residential suburbs (in accordance with requests by land developers), will cover increasing amounts of the remaining undeveloped portions of the Waterloo Moraine.

===Climate===
Waterloo has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[Köppen climate classification]])<ref>{{Cite web |title=Interactive Canada Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map |url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-canada.php |access-date=2022-07-18 |website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> with warm, humid summers and cold winters. Compared to other parts of Canada, Waterloo has fairly moderate weather. Winter temperatures usually occur between mid-December and mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May and late September. It is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F) several times each summer. Waterloo has approximately 140 frost-free days per year.

=== Technology ===
The city is part of [[Canada's Technology Triangle]] (CTT), a joint economic development initiative of Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge and the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] that markets the region internationally. Despite its name, CTT does not focus exclusively on promoting technology industries, but on all aspects of economic development.

Waterloo has a strong technology sector with hundreds of high-tech firms.<ref name="riding" /> The dominant technology company in the city is BlackBerry, makers of the [[BlackBerry]], which has its headquarters in the city and owns several office buildings near the University of Waterloo's main campus.

Notable Waterloo-based high-tech companies include:<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->
* [[Aeryon Labs]]
* [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]]
* [[Dalsa]]
* [[Descartes Systems Group]]
* [[Google]] (in neighbouring [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]])
* [[Kik Messenger]] (in neighbouring [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]])
* [[Waterloo Maple|Maplesoft]]
* [[MKS Inc.]]
* [[ON Semiconductor]]
* [[OpenText|OpenText Corporation]]
* [[Sandvine]]
* [[Vidyard]]

Many other high-tech companies, with headquarters elsewhere, take advantage of the concentration of high-tech employees in the Waterloo area, and have research and development centres there. [[Shopify]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], [[Google]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Intel]], [[McAfee]], [[NCR Corporation]], [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Agfa]] are among the large, international technology companies with development offices in Waterloo.

=== Education and research ===
Waterloo is home to two major universities, the [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Wilfrid Laurier University]].

The city is also home to three well-known think tanks – the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]], an advanced centre for the study of foundational, theoretical physics and award-winning educational outreach in science; the [[Institute for Quantum Computing]], based at the University of Waterloo, which carries out innovative research in the computer, engineering, mathematical and physical sciences; and the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]], an independent, nonpartisan think tank that addresses international governance challenges.

=== Distilling and brewing ===
Breweries and distilleries had been a significant industry in the Waterloo area until 1993 when a [[Labatt]]-owned brewery was shut down. The [[Brick Brewing Company]] operated in Waterloo but is now based in Kitchener. Waterloo was the original home of distiller [[Seagram]] (also the home town of many descendants of J.P. Seagram), which closed its Waterloo plant in 1992. Of the remaining Seagram buildings, [[Seagram Museum|one]] became home of the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), while others were converted into condominiums.

=== Other ===
The city encourages location filming of movies and TV series and many have taken advantage of Waterloo locations. Examples include ''[[Downsizing (film)|Downsizing]]'' (released in 2017), ''The Demolisher'' (2015) and ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Waterloo,%20Ontario,%20Canada |title=Waterloo Locations |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=IMDB |access-date=12 March 2017 |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313051058/http://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Waterloo,%20Ontario,%20Canada |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Region of Waterloo Paramedic Service]]s and Waterloo Fire Rescue respond to medical emergencies within the city of Waterloo. Region of Waterloo Paramedic Services may transport patients to either Grand River Hospital or St. Mary's General Hospital [[emergency department]]s, depending on proximity, anticipated wait times and the type of emergency.

Family doctors are often in short supply and a source of great concern among residents. Recruiting efforts over the previous 15 years achieved some success as of September 2018, but needed to be continued.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doctor recruitment an ongoing issue in Waterloo Region|date=18 September 2018|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8910318-doctor-recruitment-an-ongoing-issue-in-waterloo-region/|work=Waterloo Region Record|access-date=30 December 2018|quote=Although recruitment efforts over the past 15 years or so have brought many new physicians to the area, many residents are without a family doctor.|archive-date=June 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220619190738/https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2018/09/18/doctor-recruitment-an-ongoing-issue-in-waterloo-region.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Fire protection===
Fire protection and rescue services are provided by Waterloo Fire Rescue, a service of the City of Waterloo. As of 2020, there are four active fire stations in Waterloo. Waterloo Fire Rescue responds to fires, medical emergencies, car accidents and chemical incidents.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fire and emergency services |date=June 24, 2019 |url=https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/fire-and-emergency-services.aspx |publisher=City of Waterloo |access-date=7 March 2020 |archive-date=March 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326223938/https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/fire-and-emergency-services.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> (Region of Waterloo Paramedic Services also responds to medical emergencies.) When the two-tier regional government system was implemented in the early 1970s, police service was moved to the regional government, but fire service remained at the local municipality (city or township) level. From time to time, the media and interested parties raise the question of whether this service should remain at the city level, or whether there might be cost savings or service improvements if the various fire services were merged into regional fire service. A 2019 newspaper article stated that "there would likely be no cost savings, but service would improve under [a] regionalized system," in the view of some former fire chiefs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Adam |last2=Jackson |first2=Bill |title=Region of Waterloo Fire Department?
