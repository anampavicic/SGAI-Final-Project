The Dutch name of the city is '<nowiki/>'''Pacalongan'''<nowiki/>'.

== History ==
The coastal area around Pekalongan was part of the ancient Holing ([[Kalingga]]) kingdom. The 7th century [[Sojomerto inscription]], discovered in neighboring [[Batang Regency]], Central Java, is linked with Kalingga as well as the ancestor of the [[Sailendra]]s. The exact location of the Kalingga capital is unclear. It has been suggested that it was somewhere between Pekalongan and Jepara; however it is most likely that it was located in Pekalongan, rather than Jepara, since there is similarity of names between Kalingga and Pekalongan. The name probably slightly shifted over centuries, from Kalingga, Kaling, Kalong, and later added with ''pe- -an'' circumfix forming "Pekalongan".

The history of Pekalongan dates back to the early 12th century. A book written in 1178 by a [[Song dynasty]] official already had a record of Pekalongan, then known to Chinese merchants as "Pukalong". It was then a seaport of Java (then known as Dvapa). The king of Java lived at Pukalong - he knotted his hair at the back of his head, while his people had short hair and wrapped their body with colorfully woven cloth. A Chinese merchant ship set sail from [[Guangzhou|Canton]] during November, and with the aid of fair winds sailed nonstop day and night, arriving at Pukalong after about one month. The people made wine from coconuts, and produced delicious red and white cane sugar. The kingdom made coins out of bronze and copper, with 60 copper coins exchanged for one tael of gold. Local produce included [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[clove]], [[sandalwood]], [[eaglewood]] and white round [[cardamom]].<ref>Song dynasty Zhou Qufei: Ling Wai Dai Da (Reports from Beyond the Southern Mountains) in Chinese  {{ISBN|7-101-01665-0}}. Unfortunately no English translation available, the above paragraph is my GFDL translation</ref>

Pekalongan became a part of the empire of the [[Sultanate of Mataram]] through treaties and [[marriage]] alliances by the early 17th century. The area was on the geographic periphery of the empire, which was based in interior central [[Java (island)|Java]]. However, it was a wealthy area, and by the end of the 17th century, the substantial money and produce it sent to the center made it a key part of Mataram's realm. The area went into economic decline during the 18th century, and the [[Dutch East India Company]] began to gain substantial influence over the area's political and economic life. The Dutch built a fort in the city in 1753; this fort still stands.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Pekalongan (1931?).svg|thumb|left|200px|Coat of Arms of Pekalongan during colonial era, this version adopted from 1930s.]]
From the 1830s, the Pekalongan area became a major producer of [[sugar]]. Sugarcane had been grown in the area since the early 12th century, as recorded in Chinese history books, but production expanded substantially during the mid-19th century due to Dutch efforts. Initially, production was boosted through compulsory ''[[corvée]]'' labor. The Dutch colonial government took advantage of longstanding Javanese expectations that the peasantry contribute a part of their labor to the state. Between the 1860s and the 1890s, this system was phased out, and workers were paid directly. The colonial sugar industry collapsed during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but sugar remains a key export of the area in independent Indonesia.

On October 8, 1945, an anti "Swapraja"/anti feudalism movement called Three Regions Movement/"Gerakan Tiga Daerah" was established in Tegal, Pekalongan, and Brebes. The goal of this movement was to replace the blue blood regents (related to the kings from Jogyakarta and Surakarta) with ordinary people. According to the leaders of this movement, the old regents had cooperated with Japanese during World War II and sent people to Japanese slave labor camps.

The main leader of this movement was Sarjiyo, who became the new regent of Pekalongan. Other leaders of this movement were Kutil, K. Mijaya, and Ir. Sakirman. Ir Sakirman was the local leader of Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).

The old regents were arrested, stripped naked, and dragged into the prisons. Other government officials and police officers were kidnapped and massacred at Talang bridge. This movement also started a racial riot against ethnic Chinese in Brebes.

The government of Republic of Indonesia in Jogyakarta disagrees with this movement and declared it was illegal. On November 4, 1945, the movement attacked Indonesian army HQ and the regent's office in Pekalongan. The rebels were defeated by Indonesian army in a fierce battle on December 21, 1945. Most leaders of this movement were arrested and thrown into the prisons. This rebellion is known as the '''Three Regions Affair'''.
