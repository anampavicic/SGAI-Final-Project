[[Maebashi]] is the capital and [[Takasaki]] is the largest city of Gunma Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Ōta, Gunma|Ōta]], [[Isesaki, Gunma|Isesaki]], and [[Kiryū, Gunma|Kiryū]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Maebashi" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 600|page=600}}.</ref> Gunma Prefecture is one of only eight [[landlocked]] prefectures, located on the northwestern corner of the [[Kantō Plain]] with 14% of its total land being designated as [[List of national parks of Japan|natural parks]].

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Gunma Prefecture}}

The ancient province of Gunma was a center of horse breeding and trading activities for the newly immigrated continental peoples (or [[Toraijin]]). The arrival of horses and the remains of horse tackle coincides with the arrival of a large migration from the mainland. From this point forward, the horse became a vital part of Japanese military maneuvers, quickly displacing the older Yayoi tradition of fighting on foot.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

When [[Mount Haruna]] erupted in the late 6th century, Japan was still in the pre-historical phase (prior to the importation of the Chinese writing system during the Nara period). The Gunma Prefectural archaeology unit in 1994 was able to date the eruption through zoological anthropology at the corral sites that were buried in ash.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

In the past, Gunma was joined with [[Tochigi Prefecture]] and called ''[[Kenu Province]]''. This was later divided into ''Kami-tsu-ke'' (Upper Kenu, Gunma) and ''Shimo-tsu-ke'' (Lower Kenu, Tochigi). The area is sometimes referred to as Jomo (上毛, ''Jōmō''). For most of Japanese history, Gunma was known as the province of [[Kozuke Province|Kozuke]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 470|page=470}}.</ref>

In the early period of contact between western nations and Japan, particularly the late Tokugawa, it was referred to by foreigners as the "Joushu States", inside (fudai, or loyalist) Tokugawa retainers and the Tokugawa family symbol is widely seen on public buildings, temples, and shrines.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

The [[Tenmei eruption]] of [[Mount Asama]] occurred in 1783, causing enormous damage.<ref>{{Cite web |title=天明3年（1783年）浅間山噴火 |url=https://www.ktr.mlit.go.jp/tonesui/tonesui00023.html |access-date=2022-04-16 |website=www.ktr.mlit.go.jp |language=ja |archive-date=2022-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120084022/https://www.ktr.mlit.go.jp/tonesui/tonesui00023.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=天明浅間山噴火とは |url=https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%A9%E6%98%8E%E6%B5%85%E9%96%93%E5%B1%B1%E5%99%B4%E7%81%AB-156279 |access-date=2022-04-16 |website=[[Kotobank]] |language=ja |archive-date=2021-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211214164552/https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%A9%E6%98%8E%E6%B5%85%E9%96%93%E5%B1%B1%E5%99%B4%E7%81%AB-156279 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first modern silk factories were built with Italian and French assistance at Annaka in the 1870s.

In the early Meiji period, in what was locally called the Gunma Incident of 1884, a bloody struggle between the idealistic democratic westernizers and the conservative Prussian-model nationalists took place in Gunma and neighboring Nagano. The modern Japanese army gunned down farmers with new repeating rifles built in Japan. The farmers in Gunma were said to be the first victims of the [[Murata rifle]].{{cn|date=August 2022}}

In the twentieth century, the Japanese aviation pioneer Nakajima Chikushi of Oizumi, Gunma Prefecture, founded the [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]]. At first, he produced mostly licensed models of foreign designs, but beginning with the all-Japanese [[Nakajima Type 91 fighter|Nakajima 91]] fighter plane in 1931, his company became a world leader in aeronautical design and manufacture, with its headquarters at Ota, Gunma Ken. The factory now produces [[Subaru]] motorcars and other products under the name of [[Subaru]] née Fuji Heavy Industries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.subaru.co.jp/press/news-en/2017_03_31_3889/ |title=FUJI HEAVY INDUSTRIES LTD.

In the 1930s, German architect [[Bruno Taut|Bruno Julius Florian Taut]] lived and conducted research for a while in Takasaki.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bruno Taut |url=https://architectuul.com/architect/bruno-taut |access-date=2023-03-18 |website=Architectuul |archive-date=2023-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230318075856/https://architectuul.com/architect/bruno-taut |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Girard incident]], which disturbed US-Japanese relations in the 1950s, occurred in Gunma in 1957, at {{ill|Sōmagahara Base|ja|相馬原駐屯地}} near [[Shibukawa, Gunma|Shibukawa]].

Four modern prime ministers are from Gunma, namely, [[Takeo Fukuda]], [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], [[Keizo Obuchi]], and [[Yasuo Fukuda]], the son of Takeo.

One of only eight landlocked prefectures in Japan, Gunma is the northwesternmost prefecture of the Kantō plain. Except for the central and southeast areas, where most of the population is concentrated, it is mostly mountainous. To the north are [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]] and [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] prefectures, while to the east lies [[Tochigi Prefecture]]. To the west lies the [[Nagano Prefecture]], and the [[Saitama Prefecture]] is to the south.

Some of the major mountains in Gunma are [[Mount Akagi]], [[Mount Haruna]], [[Mount Myōgi]], [[Mount Nikkō-Shirane]] and [[Mount Asama]], which is located on the Nagano border. Major rivers include the [[Tone River]], the [[Agatsuma River]], and the [[Karasu River (Gunma)|Karasu River]].

As of 1 April 2012, 14% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely [[Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park|Jōshin'etsu-kōgen]], [[Nikkō National Park|Nikkō]], and [[Oze National Park|Oze]] National Parks and [[Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen Quasi-National Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=1 April 2012 |access-date=3 December 2013 |archive-date=21 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421180819/http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because Gunma is situated in inland Japan, the difference in temperature in the summer compared to the winter is large, and there is less precipitation. This is because of the [[karakkaze]] ("empty wind"), a strong, dry wind that occurs in the winter when the snow falls on the coasts of Niigata. The wind carrying clouds with snow are obstructed by the [[Echigo Mountains]], and it also snows there, although the high peaks do not let the wind go past them. For this reason, the wind changes into the ''kara-kaze''.

*Climate in [[Maebashi]]
**Average yearly precipitation: 1,163&nbsp;mm (approx. 45.8in)
**Average yearly temperature: 14.2 degrees Celsius (approx. 57.6 degrees Fahrenheit)

== Economy ==
[[File:Gunma prefecture population pyramid in 2020.svg|thumb|Gunma prefecture population pyramid in 2020]]
Gunma's modern industries include transport equipment and electrical equipment, concentrated around [[Maebashi, Gunma|Maebashi]] and the eastern region nearest [[Tokyo]]. More traditional industries include [[sericulture]] and [[agriculture]]. Gunma's major agricultural products include [[cabbage]]s and [[konnyaku]]. Gunma produces over 90% of Japan's konnyaku, and two-thirds of the farms in the village of [[Tsumagoi, Gunma|Tsumagoi]] are cabbage farms.<ref>{{cite web |title=こんにゃくをめぐる事情 |url=https://www.maff.go.jp/j/seisan/tokusan/attach/pdf/konnyaku-15.pdf |website=農林水産省の公式HP |publisher=Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries |access-date=8 June 2022 |archive-date=27 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211227045611/https://www.maff.go.jp/j/seisan/tokusan/attach/pdf/konnyaku-15.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also, the city of [[Ōta, Gunma|Ōta]] is famous for the car industry, notably the [[Subaru]] factory.

== Culture ==
There is a [[Gunma dialect|local dialect]], known in Japanese as '<nowiki/>''gunma-ben''<nowiki/>' or '''jōshū-ben''<nowiki/>'.

Gunma has a traditional card game called {{Nihongo|''[[Jomo Karuta]]''|上毛かるた}}. It features people, places, and things of regional and/or cultural importance.

=== Famous foods ===
In 2007, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries held an event to find the top 100 best local dishes across all of Japan. Three dishes were featured from Gunma; yaki-manju, [[okkirikomi]], and [[Konjac|konnyaku]].<ref>{{cite web |title=JAPAN'S TASTY SECRETS |url=https://www.maff.go.jp/j/nousin/kouryu/kyodo_ryouri/190131.html |website=農林水産省の公式HP |publisher=The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries |access-date=8 June 2022 |archive-date=8 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220608071049/https://www.maff.go.jp/j/nousin/kouryu/kyodo_ryouri/190131.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Prefectural symbols ==
The prefectural symbol consists of the first [[kanji]] of the word 'Gunma' surrounded by three stylized mountains symbolizing the three important mountains of Gunma Prefecture: [[Mount Haruna]], [[Mount Akagi]], and [[Mount Myōgi]].

For marketing, the Prefectural Government also uses [[Gunma-chan]], a small [[super deformed]] drawing of a horse character wearing a green cap. It is used on promotional posters, banners, and other notable printed materials from the Prefectural Government. Other agencies and companies formally or informally use variations of its likeness and other horse-shaped characters when making signs or notices for work on buildings, roads, and other public notices.

== In popular culture ==
There are various manga and anime that have based their settings in Gunma, such as:

*''[[A Place Further than the Universe]]''
*''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|The Flowers of Evil]]''
*''[[Initial D]]''
*''[[Nichijou]]''
*''[[You Don't Know Gunma Yet]]''

In ''[[Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead]]'', the main character Akira Tendo is from Gunma Prefecture.
