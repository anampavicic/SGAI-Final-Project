'''North Santander''' (Spanish: '''Norte de Santander''') ({{IPA|es|ˈnoɾte ðe santanˈdeɾ}}) is a [[departments of Colombia|department]] of Northeastern [[Colombia]]. It is in the north of the country, bordering [[Venezuela]]. Its capital is [[Cúcuta]], one of the country's major cities.

North Santander is bordered by Venezuela to the east and north, by [[Santander Department]] and [[Boyacá Department]] to the south, and by [[Santander Department]] and [[Cesar Department]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia-sa.com/departamentos/nsantander/nsantander-in.html |title=Norte de Santander, Colombia – South America |publisher=Colombia-sa.com |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>

The official department name is "''Departamento de Norte de Santander''" (North Santander Department) in honor of Colombian military and political leader [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], who was born and raised near Cúcuta. North Santander Department is located in the northwestern zone of the Colombian [[Andean Region (Colombia)|Andean Region]].

The area of present-day Norte de Santander played an important role in the [[history of Colombia]], during the [[Bolívar's War|War of Independence from Spain]] when Congress gave origin to the [[Greater Colombia]] in [[Villa del Rosario, Norte de Santander|Villa del Rosario]].

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian ===
The jungle zone and the valleys of the department served as the settlement of several indigenous groups, among them the [[Barí people|Barí]] and [[Chitarero|Chitatero]] people.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Guerrero Vargas|first1=José Joaquín|last2=Espinosa|first2=Jhon|date=2017|title=Norte de Santander, Colombia.

=== Spanish conquest and colonization ===
The first European to set foot on the land where the department is located was the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger|Ambrosio Alfinger]] in 1530. Although the colonization process began with the Spaniard [[Pedro de Ursúa]] in 1549. The discovered gold mines attracted a series of conquerors as well as adventurers.<ref name=":1" /> Founded in 1549 as a captaincy, the city of Pamplona served as a strategic expeditionary center where the founding of cities in Colombia and Venezuela was declared, in this city was established the first Catholic archdiocese of Northeastern Colombia. During colonial times, the city of Ocaña, founded in 1570, was used as a connection point between the Colombian Caribbean area and the capital of the province of Pamplona.<ref name=":0" />

=== Independence ===
Pamplona was the site of several independence movements, which is why one of the names the city has been given is "Ciudad Patriota" (Patriot City). Ocaña served as a strategic point for the liberating troops. In Cucutá, it was the place where the [[Admirable Campaign]] began, it was also the first city where Simón Bolívar defeated the royalist troops.<ref name=":0" />

=== Republic ===
In Villa del Rosario, the [[Congress of Cúcuta|Congress of 1821]] was established where the creation of the Republic of Colombia was established.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-16|title=Villa del Rosario: Cuna histórica de Colombia|url=https://caracol.com.co/emisora/2018/11/16/cucuta/1542373781_495983.html|access-date=2022-02-07|website=Caracol Radio|language=es}}</ref>

In April 1850, when the Republic of New Granada was born with 5 departments and 19 provinces. Santander was formed as a province with San José de Cúcuta its capital. In 1857 the sovereign Department of Santander was created and its capital was Pamplona. As of December of that year, the capital was transferred to Bucaramanga.

In May 1858, the Republic of Colombia was denominated Granadina Confederation, including eight Departments, including the one of Santander. In 1863 it was decided in the National Convention of Rio Negro, to change the name of the country to the United States of Colombia.

The Political Constitution of 1886, at the time known as "Regeneration", changed the name of the country and again it was known as the Republic of Colombia.

The area was still known as Santander and was part of the provinces of Cúcuta, Ocaña, Pamplona, Charalá, García Rovira, Guanentá, Soto, Socorro and Vélez. In 1905, the department was divided into two and for a time, Santander had Cúcuta, Ocaña, River of Gold, Pamplona, García Rovira, Santos and Fortúl provinces.

A new political division came in 1908 and as a result of it, the Department of Cúcuta existed for a short period. In April 1910, the political division of Colombia changed again. The 34 departments created in 1908 were suppressed and in 1905, Cúcuta disappeared as department and returns as part of Bucaramanga.

Law 25 July 14, 1910, took effect 20 July of that year. It was signed by the then President of the National Assembly of Colombia, Emilio Ferrero; the Secretary, Marcelino Uribe exequible Arango and declared by President [[Ramon González Valencia]].
