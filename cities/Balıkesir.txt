As of 2022, the population of Balıkesir Province is 1,257,590,<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=19 September 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> of which 314,958 in the city proper (the urban part of the districts [[Altıeylül]] and [[Karesi, Balıkesir|Karesi]]).<ref name=citypop>{{cite web|title=Balıkesir|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/turkey/balikesir/_/1684__bal%C4%B1kesir/ |publisher=citypopulation.de|access-date=16 January 2024}}</ref> Between 1341 and 1922, it was the capital of [[Sanjak of Karasi|Karasi]].

== History ==

Close to modern Balıkesir was the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town of ''[[Hadrianotherae|Hadrianutherae]]'', founded, as its name commemorates, by the emperor [[Hadrian]].<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Balikisri|volume=3|page=256}}</ref> Hadrian came to the region in 124&nbsp;A.D., as a result of a successful bear hunting he had established a city called his name here. It is estimated that the city consisted of the castle, the homestead, the stud and a few homes. It is thought that the small town was where the current stadium is present.<ref>Prof. Dr Bilge Umar, Mysia, İnkılap Yayınevi, 2006, sf. 153</ref>

Members of the Roman and Pre-Byzantine dynasty had used this castle as a vacation area and for hunting. During the [[Byzantine]] period, the small town which had become increasingly neglected was known as ''Palaiokastron'' ({{langx|el|Παλαιόκαστρον}}) meaning Old Castle.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Hadrianutherae, Balukiser|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cyzicus/hadrianutherae-balukiser/36C2D7BAD37F047BFB0C480D700FF1C6|journal=Hasluck, F.

W.|isbn=9780511696978}}</ref>

Also, when the [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]]s came from Middle Asia to Mysia, they called it Balukiser because of the remains of the castle, as ''Hisar'' is the Turkish word for castle. Balıkesir's former name was Karasi because Balıkesir city was founded by [[Karasi Bey]] in the 13th century as using the remains of the small town. 1297 is considered as the date of establishment of the city which was one of the few to be founded by the Turks in [[Anatolia]]. The [[Karasids]] was a Turkic principality in [[Mysia]]. Since the 13th century, Balıkesir city have been the administrative centre of the Mysia region.

In 1345, Balıkesir city was annexed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. In 1898 an earthquake destroyed much of the city. The number of buildings that were not destroyed in the 1898 earthquake was only 51.<ref>Karagöz, Berkan (2020). Kentlerarası Rekabette Balıkesir ve Ekonomisi, Ankara: Gece Yayınları, p. 23, {{ISBN|978-625-7904-97-1}}</ref> In 1914, Turkish students marched through the streets of the city singing a song of hatred against the Greeks.<ref name="Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918">{{cite book| title = Persecution of the Greeks in Turkey, 1914–1918| url = https://archive.org/details/persecutionofgre00consrich| publisher = Constantinople [London, Printed by the Hesperia Press]|date=1919}}</ref> In April 1916, the Christian Greeks of the villages in the vicinity of Balikesser underwent persecution from the Turks. They were refused bread on payment. The women were told that they should become Muslim so as not to die of hunger.

At the beginning of June, many young Greeks were forced by the authorities to convert to Islam at Government headquarters.<ref name="Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918" /> On 30 June 1919 Balıkesir city was occupied by the invading [[Greeks]] but on 6 September 1922, the [[Turkish Army]] took back the city. During the [[Turkish War of Independence]], Balıkesir was the main centre of the [[Kuva-yi Milliye|Turkish militias]] in Western Anatolia against the occupying [[Greek Army]].

On 3 August 1950, a major fire destroyed the centre of the city which was rebuilt later. That fire destroyed an important part of the city. According to estimates, it was the result of the firing of firecrackers belonging to child guns in a shop. According to another opinion, it was caused by the gnawing of the firecrackers of child guns by rats and this fire spread to the electrical contact. 498 shops completely burned.
It is the second biggest disaster to befall in Balıkesir after the 1898 earthquake. Nearly a thousand people were unemployed. The tents were set up by the Turkish Red Crescent and food aid was provided for a long time.<ref>Karagöz, Berkan (2020).
