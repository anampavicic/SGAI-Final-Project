'''Santa Rosa''', officially the '''City of Santa Rosa''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Santa Rosa}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, its population was 414,812 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the second largest local government unit in Laguna after [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]].{{PH census|current}} On August 28, 2019, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed Republic Act No. 11395,<ref>{{cite PH act |title=An Act Separating the City of Santa Rosa from the First Legislative District of the Province of Laguna to Constitute the Lone Legislative District of Santa Rosa |chamber=RA |number=11395 |date=August 28, 2019 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2019/08aug/20190822-RA-11395-RRD.pdf |publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]}}</ref> which separated the city from the [[Laguna's 1st congressional district|province's first district]] and granted the city its [[Santa Rosa's at-large congressional district|own congressional district]] to elect a representative in [[2022 Philippine general election|2022]]. However, for the purposes of electing [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] members, Santa Rosa remains part of the province's [[Laguna Provincial Board#1st District|first Sangguniang Panlalawigan District]].

Santa Rosa was initially known for the [[Coca-Cola]], RC Cola, and [[Toyota]] manufacturing plants in its [[industrial park|industrial estates]]. It later became popular as the site of local [[theme park]] [[Enchanted Kingdom]] and several housing and commercial developments.

==Etymology==
Santa Rosa is derived from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for Saint [[Rose of Lima]], its [[patron saint]] to whom it is consecrated to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://santarosacity.gov.ph/about-us|title=About Us|website=Santa Rosa|accessdate=July 7, 2023}}</ref>

== History ==
{{stack|float=right|[[File:Santa Rosa 2017 stamp of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|2017 stamp of the Philippines dedicated to the 225th anniversary of Santa Rosa]]}}
In 1571, Spanish ''[[conquistador]]'' [[Juan de Salcedo]], the grandson of [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], founded the town of [[Biñan]] which was annexed as a barrio to Tabuco (now [[Cabuyao, Laguna|Cabuyao]]) while exploring the region of [[Laguna de Bay]].

In 1688, Biñan, together with Barrio Bukol, separated from [[Cabuyao, Laguna|Cabuyao]]. After a series of renaming and separating barrios to become independent towns, Barrio Bukol was politically emancipated as the municipality of Santa Rosa, founded on January 18, 1792.

During the revolutionary period in 1898, the town was instrumental in the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|proclamation of Philippine independence]] from [[Spain]] when the country signed the Act of Independence on June 12, 1898. Later on, the town's local revolutionaries fought alongside the forces of [[Pío del Pilar]] during the [[Philippine–American War]].

[[File:Gusaling Museo, Santa Rosa, Laguna, Jul 2024.jpg|thumb|left|The present-day Gusaling Museo served as the municipal hall of Santa Rosa from 1828 to 1954.]]
On February 5, 1945, the town was abandoned by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] soldiers when the local guerrilla resistance movement, with support from the American and [[Philippines|Filipino]] military contingent, entered the town, where skirmishes, torture, and deaths occurred.{{Clarify|reason=Perpetrated by the guerilla movement or the Japanese soldiers?|date=January 2021}}

During the [[World War II|postwar era]] up until the 1970s, the townspeople primarily depended on basic agriculture and family-owned enterprises for their livelihood. The influence of industrialization grew in the 1980s with the entry of local and foreign investors who were responsible for the fast-paced economic and social transformation of the town and the province.

=== Cityhood ===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On July 10, 2004, Santa Rosa was converted into a city by Republic Act No. 9264,<ref name="ra9264">{{cite PH act |title=An Act Converting the Municipality of Santa Rosa in the Province of Laguna into a Component City to be Known as the City of Santa Rosa |chamber=RA |number=9264 |date=March 10, 2004 |url=http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-9264.php|publisher=The Corpus Juris }}</ref> which was approved by voters in the plebiscite. Leon Arcillas, who began his third and final term ten days before, became its first city mayor.

===Contemporary===
Arcillas was assassinated at the former city hall by three assailants.<ref>{{cite PH act |title=People of the Philippines, Plaintiff-appellee, V.

On May 14, 2007, Catindig, who ran for his full term as mayor, was defeated by Arcillas' daughter [[Arlene B. Arcillas|Arlene]].

==Geography==
