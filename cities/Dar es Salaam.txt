Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's most prominent city for arts, fashion, media, film, television, and finance. It is the capital of the co-extensive Dar es Salaam Region, one of Tanzania's [[Regions of Tanzania|31 administrative regions]], and consists of five [[Districts of Tanzania|districts]]: [[Kinondoni District|Kinondoni]] in the north; [[Ilala District|Ilala]] in the centre; [[Ubungo]] and [[Temeke]] in the south; and [[Kigamboni]] in the east across the [[Kurasini]] estuary.

Dar es Salaam remained the administrative and commercial centre. Under British [[indirect rule]], European areas such as [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]] and African areas (e.g., [[Kariakoo]] and [[Ilala District|Ilala]]) developed separately from the city centre. The city's population also included a large number of [[Indians in Tanzania|workers from British India]], many of whom came to take advantage of trade and commercial opportunities. After World War II, Dar es Salaam experienced a period of rapid growth.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Adam Christian |date=2010-10-25 |title=Dar es Salaam (1857- ) |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/dar-es-salaam-1857/ |access-date=2021-05-11 |language=en-US |archive-date=2021-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514234501/https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/dar-es-salaam-1857/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Political developments, including the formation and growth of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]], led to Tanganyika's independence from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, even when Tanganyika and the [[People's Republic of Zanzibar]] merged to form Tanzania in 1964. In 1973, provisions were made to relocate the capital to [[Dodoma]], a more centrally located city in the interior. The relocation process to Dodoma was completed, although Dar es Salaam continued to be the location of most government offices.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Adam Christian |date=2010-10-25 |title=Dar es Salaam (1857- ) |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/dar-es-salaam-1857/ |access-date=2021-05-11 |language=en-US |archive-date=2021-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514234501/https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/dar-es-salaam-1857/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1967, the [[Government of Tanzania|Tanzanian government]] declared the ''[[ujamaa]]'' policy, which made Tanzania lean towards [[socialism]]. The move hampered the potential growth of the city as the government encouraged people not to move into cities and instead remain in Ujamaa socialist villages. By the 1980s, the policy failed to combat the increasing poverty and hunger that Tanzania faced, and had delayed necessary development. This situation led to the liberalization policy of the 1980s that essentially ended socialism and silenced its proponents within Tanzania's government through political repression.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Burton |first=Eric |date=2019-01-02 |title=Navigating global socialism: Tanzanian students in and beyond East Germany |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14682745.2018.1485146 |journal=Cold War History |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=63–83 |doi=10.1080/14682745.2018.1485146 |issn=1468-2745 |pmc=6743719 |pmid=31565067 |access-date=2021-09-13 |archive-date=2022-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705005634/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14682745.2018.1485146 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Ngowi">{{cite journal |last1=Ngowi |first1=Honest |title=Economic development and change in Tanzania since independence: The political leadership factor |journal=African Journal of Political Science and International Relations |date=May 2009 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=259–267 |issn=1996-0832}}</ref>[[File:Dar es Salaam in 1930s.JPG|320x240px|thumbnail|Dar es Salaam in the 1930s, with the [[Old Boma, Dar es Salaam|Old Boma]] and [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Dar es Salaam|St. Joseph's Cathedral]] prominently in view]]

Until the late 1990s, Dar es Salaam was not regarded in the same echelon as Africa's leading cities like [[Cairo]], [[Nairobi]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Lagos]], or [[Addis Ababa]].

The city's skyline features tall buildings, among them the 35-storey PSPF Tower (finished in 2015) and the [[Tanzania Ports Authority]] (TPA) Tower, the tallest in the country (completed in 2016).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/tanzania-ports-authority-headquarters/18275 |title=Tanzania Ports Authority Headquarters |publisher=The Skyscraper Center |access-date=2020-06-02 |archive-date=2020-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729025429/http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/tanzania-ports-authority-headquarters/18275 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A number of historical buildings and elements of urban planning, such as parts of the harbour and streets going back to colonial times, still exist. The [[Old Boma, Dar es Salaam|Old Boma]], one of the city's oldest buildings, was built in 1866–67 by [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]], [[sultan]] of [[Zanzibar]], and enlarged under German rule. The Botanical Gardens now are close to the [[National Museum of Tanzania]]. The present-day [[Ikulu|State House]] goes back to Majid bin Said, and were the seat of the German and later the British colonial governments. Along with the [[Azania Front Lutheran Church]], built between 1899 and 1902,<ref>{{Cite web |title=History {{!}} Azania Front Cathedral |url=https://www.azaniafront.org/history |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=www.azaniafront.org}}</ref> and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Dar es Salaam|St. Joseph's Cathedral]], constructed around the same period,<ref>Michael Hodd, ''East Africa Handbook: The Travel Guide'', p. 344</ref> [[Ocean Road Hospital]] also belongs to a number of early historical buildings in Dar es Salaam.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sutton |first=J.E.G. |year=1970 |title=Dar es Salaam: a sketch of a hundred years |journal=Tanzania Notes and Records |issue=71 |pages=}}</ref>

====Kinondoni====
Kinondoni is the most populated of the districts. It houses half of the city's population and several high-income suburbs.

[[File:Tanzanite Bridge, From Msasani Ward in Kinondoni District to Kivukoni ward in Ilala District.jpg|thumb|Tanzanite Bridge]]
*Masaki, Oyster Bay and [[Ada Estate]] are the high-income suburbs located along the central beach. During the Colonial Era, they were the major European suburbs of the city. Diplomats and expatriates currently reside in these areas. Oyster Bay Beach (also known as Coco Beach) is the only white sandy beach east of Kinondoni.
*Mikocheni and Regent Estate are also suburbs within the district. These are high and middle-income areas with Mikocheni B enjoying a higher population density than Mikocheni A and Regent Estate. According to the 2012 census, the Mikocheni ward had a population of 32,947.<ref name="2012 Census">[http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf Population Distribution by Administrative Units, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230453/http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf |date=May 2, 2013}}</ref>{{rp|page 75}}
[[File:Road in Kinondoni MC, Dar es Salaam.jpg|thumb|Bagamoyo rd, Mwnanyamala, Kinondoni District, Dar es Salaam]]
*[[Msasani]] is a peninsula to the northeast of the city center and home to expatriates from the United Kingdom and other western countries. It contains a mixture of traditional shops and western-oriented resorts and stores including the redevelopment of the former Msani Slipway shipyard by architect [[Antoni Folkers]]
*Mbezi Beach is the beachfront suburb located along the northern Dar es Salaam Beach. It contains several tourist hotels, residences and a kite-surfing area by Upepo Avenue.
*Sinza, Kijitonyama, Magomeni, [[Kinondoni]] and [[Mwenge, Dar es Salaam|Mwenge]] are more ethnically mixed than the areas above and are located west of Dar es Salaam's Central Business District.

====Ilala====
The administrative district of Ilala contains almost all government offices, ministries, and the Central Business District. It is the transportation hub of the city, as the [[Julius Nyerere International Airport]], Central Railway Station and Tazara Railway Station are all within the district's boundaries. The residential areas are mainly middle- to high-income, among them:
[[File:The Askari Monument in Dar es Salaam.jpg|thumb|upright|The Askari Monument along Samora Avenue marks the exact centre of Dar es Salaam, in the [[Ilala district]].]]
*Upanga and [[Kisutu]] have the highest concentration of Asian communities within Dar es Salaam, with residents of Indian and Arabic descent. These areas contain colonial houses and mansions built in Indian, Arabic and European styles. Upanga is divided into [[Upanga East]] and [[Upanga West]].
*[[Kariakoo]] is the shopping district of the city: shops, bazaars, and merchants sell products from foodstuffs to hardware. The Kariakoo Market contains the only underground section of the city. It is the major supply point of the food consumed by all Dar es Salaam residents.
*Tabata, Segerea and Ukonga are located slightly farther west from the city center.
*Ilala, among the middle-income suburbs very near to the city center, is marked by the [[Askari Monument]] and suffers from gang activity.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-07 |title=Police arrests 31 members of 'Panya Road' gang in Dar |url=https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/national/police-arrests-31-members-of-panya-road-gang-in-dar-3807802 |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=The Citizen |language=en}}</ref>

====Temeke====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
Temeke is the main industrial district of the city, where manufacturing (both heavy and light industry) is located. To the east is the Port of Dar es Salaam, the largest port in the country. Temeke is believed to have the largest concentration of low-income residents due to industry. It is home to military and police officers as well as port officials.
*Kurasini, located on the harbour, contains Dar es Salaam Port, the Police College, the Mgulani Police Barracks and the [[Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair]] grounds. The main residents are police officers and port officials.
[[File:BridgeOfLight.jpg|thumb|[[Kigamboni Bridge]] at night]]
*Chang'ombe is one of the few higher-income areas in Temeke. It has maintained this status due to the presence of African high colonial officers and some industry owners from the Colonial Era. Chang'ombe houses the Dar es Salaam University College of Education, the National Stadium and Uhuru Stadium.
*Temeke, Mtoni, Tandika, Kijichi, and Mbagala are middle to low-income suburbs, of which the last is the largest suburb in the entire district.

====Ubungo====

The Ubungo terminal serves as a transportation link to most large Dar es Salaam urban nodes.{{clarify|what exactly is an urban node?|date=April 2018}} The [[narrow-gauge]] commuter rail runs from there to the city centre, with ten [[level crossing]]s along the route.

This district is characterised with a lot of potential social and economic centres such as industries i.e. Urafiki textile industry, bus station and various institutes and universities such as National Institute of Transport(NIT)

====Kigamboni====
[[Kigamboni]] (also known as South Beach), a beachfront suburb on a peninsula, is home to an economically diverse population. Access to the suburb is mainly by ferry, although the [[Kigamboni Bridge]] provides an alternative.

===Climate===
Dar es Salaam experiences tropical climatic conditions, typified by hot and humid weather throughout much of the year due to its proximity to the equator and the warm Indian Ocean. It has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''/''As''). Annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1150|mm|in|0|disp=or}}, and in a normal year there are two rainy seasons: the "long rains" in April and May, and the "short rains" in November and December.

Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Dar es Salaam is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], Dar es Salaam, [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]) which would be the most severely affected by the future [[sea level rise]]. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050.

Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's most important city for both business and government. The city contains high concentrations of trade and other services and manufacturing compared to other parts of the country, which has about 65 percent of its population in rural areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Downtown includes small businesses, many of which are run by traders and proprietors whose families originated in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent—areas of the world with which the settlements of the Tanzanian coast have had long-standing trading relations.

The Dar es Salaam Central Business District is the largest in Tanzania and comprises the [[Kisutu]], [[Kivukoni]], [[Upanga East|Upanga]] and [[Kariakoo]] areas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} The downtown area is located in the [[Ilala District|Ilala]] district. Kivukoni is home to the Tanzania Central Bank, The [[Bank of Tanzania]], the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and the city's important Magogoni fish market.<ref name="allafrica.com"/> With businesses and offices, Kisutu is the location of Dar es Salaam central railway station, the PSPF Towers, and the TPA Tower.

Dar es Salaam is undergoing major construction and development.{{Update inline|date=March 2021}} The 35-storey [[PSPF Twin Towers]] are the second tallest building in the city and the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Dar-s-skyscraper-boom--Watchers-see-signs-of-prosperity-/-/1840392/2412228/-/15fryogz/-/index.html |title=Dar skyscraper boom: Here's the untold story - National |access-date=25 May 2015 |archive-date=22 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022121720/http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Dar-s-skyscraper-boom--Watchers-see-signs-of-prosperity-/-/1840392/2412228/-/15fryogz/-/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has major infrastructural challenges, including an outdated transport system and occasional power rationing.

On a natural harbour on the Indian Ocean, Dar es Salaam is one of the hubs of the [[Transport in Tanzania|Tanzanian transportation system]], as the main railways and several highways originate in or near the city to provide convenient transportation for commuters.

===Local public transport===
Public minibus share taxis (''[[dala dala]]'') are the most common form of transport in Dar es Salaam and are often found at the major bus terminals of [[Makumbusho]], Ubungo and other areas of the city. However, since the introduction of the motorcycle transit business known as "bodaboda", most people prefer it,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-04-29 |title=Government moves to make bodabodas safer in Dar |url=https://www.urbanafrica.net/news/government-moves-make-bodabodas-safer-dar/ |access-date=2020-08-15 |website=UrbanAfrica.Net |language=en-US |archive-date=2020-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803175825/https://www.urbanafrica.net/news/government-moves-make-bodabodas-safer-dar/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The other side of bodaboda 'empire' |url=https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/Study--Why--bodabodas--rule/1840340-2521914-13uggqu/index.html |access-date=2020-08-15 |website=The Citizen |language=en |archive-date=2022-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401033007/https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/Study--Why--bodabodas--rule/1840340-2521914-13uggqu/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> allowing them to get into the city faster as compared with the minibuses, which encounter heavy traffic.

===Music===
[[File:The African tranditional dance in Dar es Salaam..jpg|left|thumb|A traditional African dance in Dar es Salaam]]
The music scene in Dar es Salaam is divided among several styles. The longest-standing style is live dance music ([[muziki wa dansi]]) played by bands such as [[DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra]] and Malaika Musical Band. [[Taarab]], which was traditionally popular in Zanzibar has also found a niche. However, it remains small compared both to dance music and "[[Tanzanian hip hop|Bongo Flava]]", a broad category representing the Tanzanian take on hip hop and rhythm and blues that has quickly become the most popular locally produced music. The rap music scene is also present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanhiphop.com/update/halisi.htm |title=Africanhiphop.com presents: Hali Halisi—the Real Situation |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010455/http://www.africanhiphop.com/update/halisi.htm |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Traditional music, which locally refers to tribal music, is still performed, but typically only on family-oriented occasions such as weddings.

In the 1970s, the Ministry of National Youth Culture aimed to create a national culture stressing the importance of music. Dar es Salaam became the music center in Tanzania, with the local radio showcasing new bands and dominating the music and cultural scene. With this ''ujamaa'' (family) mentality governing culture and music, a unified people's culture was created, leading to the rise of hip hop culture.<ref name=Lemelle/> Throughout the years, the radio in Dar es Salaam has played a major role in the dissemination of music, because many people do not have television; cassettes are more common than CDs.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

[[Internet café]]s are found in the city centre, and free Wi-Fi hotspots are available in various government and nongovernment institutions as well as public transport.

Mobile-telephone access to the Internet via [[4G]] is still relatively expensive, though [[5G]] is making its way through major cities and towns {{As of|2022|lc=y}} with plans to go nationwide in the advanced stages.
