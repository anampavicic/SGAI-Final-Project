'''Moçâmedes''' is a [[List of cities and towns in Angola|city]] in southwestern [[Angola]], capital of [[Namibe Province]]. The city's current population is 255,000 (2014 census).<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/angola/cities/ Population of the major cities in Angola]. ''citypopulation.de''.</ref> Founded in 1840 by the [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese colonial administration]], the city was named '''Namibe''' between 1985 and 2016. Moçâmedes has a cool dry climate and desert vegetation, because it is near the [[Namib Desert]].

== History ==
[[File:1908 Angola Boer Wagon in Mocamedes.jpg|thumb|left|Moçâmedes in 1908.]]
[[File:Paroquia de Santo Adrião (19511529296).jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese colonial architecture]] in the historic centre of Moçâmedes.]]
The area was first explored by the Portuguese in 1785 and claimed for Portugal by [[Luís Cândido Cordeiro Pinheiro Furtado]], who had been sent there in the frigate ''Loanda'' by the then governor-general of Angola, Baron Moçâmedes (Portuguese: ''Barão de Mossâmedes''), who also sent an overland expedition headed by [[Gregório José Mendes]] to rendezvous with Furtado. They renamed the bay Moçâmedes in honour of the baron.

In 1839 the then governor-general of Angola, [[António Manuel de Noronha|Admiral Noronha]], sent a fresh expedition to subdue the local chiefs and make them vassals of Portugal.

Moçâmedes was officially founded in 1840 by the Portuguese colonial administration on a bay that the Portuguese originally called ''Angra do Negro'' by order of Portuguese prime minister, the [[José Travassos Valdez|Count of Bonfim]], who was also head of the Colonial Department.<ref>Francisco Travassos Valdez, ''Six Years of a Traveller's Life in Western Africa'' (London: Hurst & Blackett, 1861), Volume 2, pp.336-338.</ref>

In 1840 a factory was established and in July of the same year a fort was built at Ponta Negra. The area was colonized mainly by Portuguese settlers from [[Madeira]] and [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]; in the 1850s the Portuguese government also gave sea passage and financial assistance to a large number of German colonists.<ref>Francisco Travassos Valdez (1861), Volume 2, pp.346-347.</ref>

The village [[Fishing in Angola|grew as a fishing port]] and by the 1960s it had 143 fishing boats and several fish processing factories. The port soon ranked alongside other important fishing ports such as [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]] and [[Lobito]].

About 200&nbsp;km from the city of Moçâmedes the Portuguese authorities founded the [[Iona National Park]], Angola's oldest and largest national park, proclaimed as a reserve in 1937 and upgraded to a national park covering 15,150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 1964.

==Climate==
Moçâmedes has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Despite being well north of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] on the Atlantic Coast, the climate is subtropical due to the cooling effect of the northward-flowing [[Benguela Current]] causing July and August to be below 18&nbsp;°C.

During 1966-67 a major [[iron ore]] terminal was built at Saco, the bay 12&nbsp;km north of Moçâmedes, to serve the iron ore mine inland at [[Cassinga]]. Construction of the mine installations and a 300&nbsp;km railway were commissioned to [[Krupp]] of Germany and the modern harbour terminal to SETH, a Portuguese company owned by [[MT Højgaard|Højgaard & Schultz]] of Denmark.

Within one year the first 250,000 ton ore carrier docked and loaded with ore in 1967.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://mocamedesregistosefactos.blogspot.com/2008/03/angola-momedes-minha-terra-eu-te-vi.html Angola - Moçâmedes, minha terra, eu te vi crescer...

==Culture==
[[File:Parabolic Shelters (18861902633).jpg|thumb|left|[[Tourism in Angola|Tourism]] is an increasingly important industry in Moçâmedes.]]

===Religion===
The city's Sé Catedral de São Pedro is the [[cathedral]] episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Namibe]], which was established in 2009 on territory split from its Metropolitan's [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lubango]], to which it is a [[suffragan diocese]].

===Sports===
In 2013, Moçâmedes, then called Namibe, and the national capital [[Luanda]] jointly hosted the [[2013 FIRS Men's Roller Hockey World Cup]], the first time that a World Cup of [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] was held in Africa.

== Transport ==
[[File:Cargamento de mineirios, Namibe.JPG|thumb|right|Moçâmedes is a major [[seaport]].]]

=== Rail ===
Moçâmedes is the terminus of the [[Moçâmedes Railway]]. This line was originally 600mm gauge<ref>{{cite EB1922 |wstitle=Angola |volume=30 |page=139 |first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}</ref> but was converted to 1067mm gauge in the 1950s.

=== Sea ===
{{Main|Port of Namibe}}
It has one of Angola's three major [[Port of Namibe|ports]], alongside [[Port of Luanda|Luanda]] and [[Port of Lobito|Lobito]].

=== Air ===
Moçâmedes is served by the [[Namibe Airport]] located about 7&nbsp;km to the south of the city.  The old [[Yuri Gagarin]] airport, only about 1.7&nbsp;km from the city's center, connects the city to the rest of the country.
