==History==
The name Cimahi was taken from the Cimahi river that flows through the city. The word originated from the [[Sundanese language]] and literally means "enough water". Residents of Cimahi get their water supply from the river.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEJARAH|url=http://kpm.cimahikota.go.id/index.php/en/halaman/sejarah|access-date=16 September 2015|language=id|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081044/http://kpm.cimahikota.go.id/index.php/en/halaman/sejarah|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Cimahi's prominence increased in 1811, when [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies|Governor-General]] [[Herman Willem Daendels]] constructed the [[Great Post Road]]. A checkpoint, known as Loji, was built in Cimahi Square. Between 1874 and 1893, the Cimahi rail station and a railroad connecting [[Bandung]] and [[Cianjur]] was built. The building of military training centers and other military buildings was started in 1886. Cimahi was granted [[Districts of Indonesia|district]] status in 1935. In 1975, Cimahi became the first administrative city in [[West Java]] and the third in [[Indonesia]]. Cimahi was then granted full [[city]] status in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sejarah|url=http://www.cimahikota.go.id/page/detail/1|access-date=16 September 2015|language=id|archive-date=22 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822021219/http://www.cimahikota.go.id/page/detail/1|url-status=dead}}</ref>
