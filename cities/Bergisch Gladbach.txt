'''Bergisch Gladbach''' ({{IPA|de|ˌbɛʁɡɪʃ ˈɡlatbax|-|De-Bergisch_Gladbach.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] in the [[Cologne/Bonn Region]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, and capital of the [[Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis]] (district).

==Geography==
Bergisch Gladbach is east of the [[Rhine]] and about 10 km east of [[Cologne]].

==City structure==
The urban area of Bergisch Gladbach is not divided into city districts (''[[Stadtbezirk]]e'') with their own district representation. For statistical purposes, there are six statistical districts (''statistische [[Bezirk]]e''), which are numbered consecutively and are divided into several districts (''[[:de: Stadtteile]]'') with their own names. These are mainly name of former smaller settlements from which today's urban area developed, or new development areas whose names have been memorized over time for better orientation. Bensberg was an independent town until 1975. Before 1975, Schildgen belonged to the municipality of [[Odenthal]].

*Statistical District 1: Schildgen (11), Katterbach (12), Nussbaum (13), Paffrath (14), Hand (15)
*Statistical District 2: City Center (21), Hebborn (22), Heidkamp (23), Gronau (24)
*Statistical District 3: Romaney (31), Herrenstrunden (32), Sand (33)
*Statistical District 4: Herkenrath (41), Asselborn (42), Bärbroich (43)
*Statistical District 5: Lückerath (51), Bensberg (52), Bockenberg (53), Kaule (54), Moitzfeld (55)
*Statistical District 6: Refrath (61), Alt Refrath (62), Kippekausen (63), Frankenforst (64), Lustheide (65)

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Beginning in the north, the neighbouring municipalities and neighbouring towns are clockwise [[Odenthal]], [[Kürten]], [[Overath]], [[Rösrath]], [[Cologne]] and [[Leverkusen]].

==History==
Early settlements existed in the 13th century, but the town was officially founded only in 1856.

[[File:Altes Schloss Bensberg and City Hall, June 2021.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Old [[castle]] and town hall of Bensberg]]
The word ''Bergisch'' in the name does not originate from its location in the county of [[Berg (German region)|Berg]], and it was not added to distinguish it from [[Mönchengladbach]], as is believed by many people, but from the counts who gave their name to the region.

In the early 12th century, the counts of Berg settled in the area, which later became the Duchy of Berg (under Napoleon, it became a grand duchy). That is where the first part of the name (''Bergisch'') comes from, the town being located in the former County of Berg. The town is the administrative headquarters (''Kreisstadt'') of the Rheinish-Bergisch district (''Kreis'').

The second part of the name, ''Gladbach'', originates from [[Low Rhenish]] (''Bergisches Platt'') and means ''canalised stream'' in reference to the small river (the ''Strunde'') that was artificially canalised in early medieval times. In ''Bergisch Platt'', the regional dialect, ''gelaat'' (laid) eventually evolved to ''glad'' (the 'd' is often pronounced as a 't'). The second part of the word, ''Bach'', is the [[Standard German]] word for a small stream and refers to the ''[[Strunde]]''.

In 1975, the town incorporated the neighbouring Bensberg, and when it reached a population of 100,000 in 1977 it was given city status.
