==History==
Khoy was named in ancient times for the salt mines that made it an important spur of the Silk Route.<ref name="Andrew Burke pp. 138"/> 3000 years ago, a city existed on the area where Khoy is located nowadays, but its name became Khoy only in the 14th centuries ago.<ref name="Lida Balilan Asl 2013">Lida Balilan Asl, Elham Jafari. "Khoy's Expansion from Early Islam to Late Qajar According to Historical Documents" published spring 2013. vol 3</ref> In 714 BC, [[Sargon II]] passed the region of which Khoy is part of in a campaign against [[Urartu]].<ref name="Lida Balilan Asl 2013"/>

During the reign of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Greater Armenia]] this city was a part of [[Nor-Shirakan]] province (ashkar). Khoy was mentioned in the 8th century AD and was called ''Her'' by [[Anania Shirakatsi]] in "[[Ashkharatsuyts]]".

In the [[Parthian empire|Parthian]] period, Khoy was the gateway of the Parthian Empire in the Northwest. During the reign of Armenian king [[Tigranes the Great]], Khoy is mentioned as being an important settlement of the [[Silk Route]].<ref name="Lida Balilan Asl 2013"/> Around the year 37 BC, [[Mark Antony]] had crossed the plain that is located between Khoy and [[Marand]] during one of the many and frequent [[Roman-Parthian Wars]].<ref name="Lida Balilan Asl 2013"/>

Scholars such as [[Josef Markwart]] consider Khoy to be the identical to the ''Gobdi'' station mentioned in the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.{{sfn|Manandian|1965|p=113}}

One of the important historic elements of the city is [[Saint Sarkis Church, Khoy|Surp Sarkis Church]]. [[Armenian language|Armenian]] documents wrote that the date of the making has to be either 332 or 333 AD.<ref name="Lida Balilan Asl 2013"/> In the city and its surrounding villages, churches are seen and it is reported that [[Armenians]] have always been comprising a significant amount of the city’s population.<ref name="Lida Balilan Asl 2013"/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}

By the first half of the 11th century the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperors]] were actively trying to round off their eastern territories, in an attempt to absorb the unstable Armenian dynasties. In 1021-2 emperor [[Basil II]] led his army as far as Khoy within 175&nbsp;km of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], and obtained the surrender of royalty from the [[Artsruni|Artsruni dynasty]] of [[Van, Turkey|Van]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Minorsky|first=Vladimir|author-link=Vladimir Minorsky|title=Studies in Caucasian History: I.

In 1210, the city was conquered by the forces of [[Kingdom of Georgia]] sent by [[Tamar the Great]] under the command of Zakaria and Ivane [[Mkhargrdzeli]]. This was a response to the sacking of Georgian-controlled [[Ani]] which occurred in 1208 and left 12,000 Christians dead.<ref>{{cite book |last1=L.

The city was ruled over by Malika, wife of [[Jalal al-Din Mangburni]] after his conquest of the city in the late 1220s.<ref>Tamta's World by Anthony Eastmond, page 108</ref>

===Modern period===
[[File:Gold coin of Karim Khan Zand, minted in Khoy.jpg|thumb|right|Gold coin of [[Karim Khan Zand]], struck at the Khoy mint, dated 1779]]
In the wake of the demise of the [[Safavids]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] took Khoy on 6 May 1724, a territorial gain which was confirmed with [[Imperial Russia]] through the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|date=2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810866065|page=xlvi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGZQL41tg_oC&q=ottomans+khoy}}</ref>

Until 1828, Khoy had a large number of [[Armenians]]; however, the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828), gave the Russians the right to encourage Armenians to immigrate into the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, a small Armenian population remained living in Khoy. This was noted by an American missionary in 1834.<ref name="Eli Smith pp 315">Smith noted that the city had between 4000 and 7000 Muslim families, while only about 100 Armenian families were left. {{Cite book|author=Smith, Eli |author-link=Eli Smith|year=1834 |title=Missionary Researches in Armenia: Including a Journey through Asia Minor, and into Georgia and Persia |publisher=G. Wightmann |page=315}}</ref> He noted further that in the villages around Khoy there were a few more, but the vast majority had migrated to the North of the [[Aras river]] following Russia's victory over Persia in 1828 and the encouraged settling in the newly incorporated Russian regions of [[Eastern Armenia]].<ref name="Eli Smith pp 315"/>

With the advent of the 1910s, Khoy was occupied by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops, but they were completely expelled from the area by the Russians by 1911.{{sfn|Atabaki|2006|page=70}} Khoy was one of the many cities in Iran which garrisoned Russian infantry and [[Cossacks]].{{sfn|Atabaki|2006|page=70}} The Russians retreated at the time of [[Enver Pasha]]'s offensive in the Iran-Caucasus region, but returned in around early 1916, and stayed in the region up to the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]].{{sfn|Atabaki|2006|page=70}} In 1918, for a final brief period, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] took Khoy until the decisive end of [[World War I]] and the [[Armistice of Mudros]].{{sfn|Atabaki|2006|page=70}} In [[World War II]], Khoy was again occupied by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops, who remained until [[Iran crisis of 1946|1946]]. After 1946 the city indefinitely became part of [[Iran]] and is located in the far northwest of the country.
