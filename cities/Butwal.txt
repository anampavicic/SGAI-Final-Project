Geographically, Butwal is at the [[Intersection (road)|intersection]] of Nepal's two different National Highways, [[Mahendra Highway]] and [[Siddhartha Highway]].

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[Fossil]]s of ancient hominoids [[Sivapithecus|Ramapithecus]] were found near the [[Tinau]] (Tilottama) River, also known as paari Butwal, as early as 1932, including a 10.1-million-year-old tooth.<ref>

===Medieval history===
In medieval time Butwal was known as Khasauli as it was believed to be established by Khas king. Later after the collapse of the Khasa empire it was ruled by the Sen kings of Palpa when it developed as a trading point between hilly people and plain people. In the 17th century Palpa with Butwal was annexed by Gorkha Empire. Butwal was also a place where a major battle of the [[Anglo-Nepalese war]] was fought i.e. Battle of [[Jitgadi Fort]] where the Gorkha army led by [[Ujir Singh Thapa]] beat the British forces.

===Modern history===
[[File:Tinau river in butwal.jpg|thumb|As recently as 1950, Butwal was a minor village on the western bank of Tilottama River (also known as Tinau)]]
The area was a loose settlement that acted as a trading post between the hilly districts of the [[Lumbini Zone|Lumbini zone]] and the Indian plains. Thus, historically Butwal connected Nepali Pahari people with their Indian neighbors. As the British [[East India Company]] annexed [[Awadh]] from its [[Nawab of Awadh|hereditary rulers]] while the [[Shah Dynasty]] attempted to annex the [[Terai]], Butwal became one of the bones of contention leading to the [[Gurkha War]] 1814–16 AD.<ref>

When King [[Tribhuvan]] fled to [[India]] in 1950 during the revolt against the [[Rana dynasty]] he traveled through Butwal. Then it was little more than a village on the western bank of Tilottama River (also known as [[Tinau]]).

Butwal is a relatively newly urbanized area, emerging and growing rapidly only since 1960 AD. With the completion of the [[Siddhartha Highway]] ([[File:NPL H10.svg|30px]][[Siddhartha Highway|H10]]) in 1968 AD, starting from the border at Sunauli through Butwal to Pokhara and then in1990s [[Mahendra Highway]]([[File:NPL H01.svg|30px]][[Mahendra Highway|H01]]) across the full east–west expanse of Nepal's [[Terai]]. Butwal has made tremendous progress in the country.

==Demographics==

The population of Butwal is 91,733 (census 2015 AD), according to the present stage the population is rapidly increasing with around 150,000 and above and consists of people of mixed groups and castes; these include [[Pahari people (Nepal)|Pahari]] immigrants from nearby hill districts especially [[Palpa District|Palpa]], [[Arghakhanchi]], [[Parbat]], [[Gulmi]], [[Syangja]] and  also local people from Terai origin.l<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/nepal-population/cities/|title=Population of Cities in Nepal (2021)|access-date=19 January 2018|archive-date=28 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728020537/http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/nepal-population/cities/|url-status=live}}</ref>
