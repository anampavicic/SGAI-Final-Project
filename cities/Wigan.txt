'''Wigan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|ɡ|ən}} {{respell|WIG|ən}}) is a town in [[Greater Manchester]], England, on the [[River Douglas, Lancashire|River Douglas]]. The town is midway between the two cities of [[Manchester]], {{convert|16|mi|km|1}} to the south-east, and [[Liverpool]], {{convert|17|mi|km|0}} to the south-west. It is the largest settlement in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan]] and is its administrative centre. The town has a population of 107,732<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/understandingtownsinenglandandwalespopulationanddemography|title=Understanding towns in England and Wales: population and demography - Office for National Statistics|website=www.ons.gov.uk}}</ref> and the wider borough of 330,714.<ref>{{United Kingdom district population citation}}</ref> Wigan is part of the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Lancashire]].

Wigan was in the territory of the [[Brigantes]], an ancient [[List of ancient Celtic peoples and tribes|Celtic tribe]] that ruled much of what is now [[Northern England]]. The Brigantes were subjugated in the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and the Roman settlement of ''Coccium'' was established where Wigan lies. Wigan was incorporated as a [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] in 1246, following the issue of a [[charter]] by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III of England]]. At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], it was one of four boroughs in Lancashire established by [[royal charter]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] saw a dramatic economic expansion and rapid rise in population. Wigan became a major [[mill town]] and coal mining district; at its peak, there were 1,000 pit shafts within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of the town centre.<ref name="Evo">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Frangopulo|1977|p=139.}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Wigan County Borough Council |title=The County Borough of Wigan: Official Handbook |year=1972 |author-link=County Borough of Wigan}}</ref> Coal mining ceased in the later 20th century.

[[Wigan Pier]], a wharf on the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], was made famous by the writer [[George Orwell]]. In his book ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' (1937), Orwell highlighted the poor working and living conditions of inhabitants in the 1930s. Following the decline of [[heavy industry]], Wigan Pier's warehouses and wharves became a local heritage centre and cultural quarter. The [[Brick Community Stadium|Brick Community Stadium]] (formerly known as DW Stadium) is home to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic Football Club]] and [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan Warriors Rugby League Football Club]].

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
The name of the town has been recorded variously as ''Wigan'' in 1199, ''Wygayn'' in 1240, and ''Wygan'' in numerous historical documents.<ref name="British history">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Farrer|Brownbill|1911|pp=68–78}}</ref>

The name ''Wigan'' is probably a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] place-name : it might be a diminutive form of Brittonic ''*wīg'' "homestead, settlement" (later Welsh ''gwig''), plus the nominal suffix ''-an'' has also been suggested (c.f. numerous places in France named [[Le Vigan (disambiguation)|Le Vigan]]); the place name may refer to a Latin ''viccus''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=James |first=Alan G. |url=http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |title=The Brittonic Language in the Old North: A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence |volume=2: Guide to the Elements |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813011121/http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Newsletter 15: Wigan&nbsp;– What's in a name? |date=15 July 1998 |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/content/News_Letters/news015.htm |access-date=18 November 2008 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Mills |first=A.D. |title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t40.e13974&srn=1&ssid=595401713#FIRSTHIT |year=2003 |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-852758-9}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> It has also been suggested directly a Celtic personal name ''Wigan'', a name corresponding to [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] ''Vicanus'', [[Old Welsh]] ''Uuicant'' or [[Old Breton]] ''Uuicon''.<ref name="pnlanc">{{Cite book |last=Ekwall |first=Eilert |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028039588 |title=The Place Names Of Lancashire |date=1922 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028039588/page/n120 103]}}</ref>

Similar place-names to the English ''Wigan'' exist in France, such as [[Le Vigan, Gard]] (''Avicantus'', Roman inscription ; ''Locus de Vicano'' 1050) of unknown origin<ref>Paul Fabre, ''Dictionnaire des noms de lieux des Cévennes'', éditions Bonneton, 2009, p. 155</ref> and [[Le Vigan, Lot]], from Latin ''vicanum'', derived form of ''vicus'' "town" + suffix ''-anum'',<ref>Gaston Bazalgues, ''À la découverte des noms de lieux du Quercy'' : ''Toponymie lotoise'', Éditions de la Bouriane et du Quercy, Gourdon, 2002, p. 126</ref> and the hamlets in [[Normandy]] such as (Le) Vigan ([[L'Oudon]], Calvados) and Manoir du Vigan that derive from a Celtic given-name ''*Wigan'', found as ''feodum Wigani'' in the 12th century or ''turres Wiguen'' at [[Thaon]] (Calvados) and survives in the Norman surname ''Vigan'' (still in use in Calvados).<ref>François de Beaurepaire, ''Les Noms de lieux du Calvados'' (''annoté par [[Dominique Fournier]]''), Paris, [[Éditions L'Harmattan|L'Harmattan]], 2022, p. 379.</ref>

=== Brigantes ===
There is very little evidence of prehistoric activity in the area, especially pre-Iron Age;<ref>{{Citation |title=Prehistoric Wigan |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#PWigan |access-date=18 November 2008 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref> however, Celtic names in the area around Wigan—such as [[Bryn, Greater Manchester|Bryn]], [[Makerfield]] and [[Ince-in-Makerfield|Ince]]—indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the [[Iron Age]].<ref name="wiganhissocceltic">{{Citation |title=Celtic Wigan |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#Celtic |access-date=18 November 2008 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref>

=== Romans ===
In the 1st century, the area was [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquered by the Romans]].<ref name="wiganhissocceltic" /> The late 2nd-century [[Antonine Itinerary]] mentions a Roman settlement called ''Coccium'' {{convert|17|mi|km}} from the [[castra|Roman fort]] at Manchester ([[Mamucium]]) and {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the fort at [[Ribchester]] ([[Bremetennacum]]). Although the distances are slightly out, it has been assumed that Coccium is Roman Wigan.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Waddelove|2001|p=299.}}</ref> Possible derivations of Coccium include from the Latin ''coccum'', meaning "scarlet in colour, scarlet cloth", or from ''cocus'', meaning "cook".<ref>{{Citation |title=Coccuim: Minor Romano-British Settlement: Wigan, Lancashire |url=http://www.roman-britain.co.uk/places/coccium/ |publisher=Roman-Britain}}</ref> Over the years chance finds (coins and pottery) provided clear indications that a Roman settlement existed at Wigan, although its size and status remained unknown.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Oxford Archaeology North|2011|p=14.}}</ref> In 2005 investigations ahead of the [[Grand Arcade (Wigan)|Grand Arcade development]], and in 2008 at the Joint Service Centre development, have proven that Wigan was a significant Roman site in the late first and second centuries AD.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Oxford Archaeology North|2011|p=2.}}</ref> The excavated remains of ditches at Ship Yard off Millgate were consistent with use by the Roman military and possibly formed part of the defences for a fort or a temporary camp. More remains were excavated to the south, in the area of McEwen's Yard (opposite the baths), where foundations of a large and important building were discovered, together with many other Roman features. The building is {{convert|36|by|18|m|ft}} in size with stone walls and a tiled roof. It contained around nine or ten rooms including three with [[hypocaust]]s. It had a colonnaded [[portico]] on the northern side, which presumably formed the main entrance. The structure's ground-plan and the presence of the hypocausts show it may have been a [[bath-house]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Oxford Archaeology North|2011|p=30.}}</ref> A timber building excavated at the Joint Service Centre (top of the Wiend) has been interpreted as a barrack block. This suggests a [[Roman fort]] occupied the crest of the hill, taking advantage of the strategic position overlooking the River Douglas.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Oxford Archaeology North|2011|page=40}}</ref> The evidence gained from these excavations shows that Wigan was an important Roman settlement, and was almost certainly the place referred to as Coccium in the Antonine Itinerary.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Oxford Archaeology North|2011|page=38}}</ref>

=== Anglo-Saxons ===
In the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period, the area was probably under the control of the [[Northumbria]]ns and later the [[Mercia]]ns.<ref name="medwigan">{{Citation |last=Bill Aldridge |title=Medieval Wigan |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#Medieval |access-date=19 November 2008 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref> In the early 10th century there was an influx of Scandinavians expelled from Ireland. This can be seen in place names such as [[Scholes, Greater Manchester|Scholes]]—now a part of Wigan—which derives from the Scandinavian ''skali'' meaning "hut". Further evidence comes from some street names in Wigan which have Scandinavian origins.<ref name="medwigan" />

=== Domesday Book ===
Wigan is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], possibly because it was included in the Neweton barony (now [[Newton-le-Willows]]). It is likely that the mention of the unnamed church in the [[manorialism|manor]] of Neweton is [[Wigan Parish Church]] and not the church of St.Oswald (Winwick) which is specifically named in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref name="medwigan" /> The rectors of the parish church were [[lord of the manor|lords of the manor]] of Wigan, a [[Subinfeudation|sub-manor]] of Neweton, until the 19th century. Wigan was incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a [[charter]] by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] to [[John Maunsell]], the local church rector and lord of the manor.<ref name="medwigan" /> The borough was later granted another charter in 1257–1258, allowing the lord of the manor to hold a market every Monday and two annual fairs.<ref name="British history" /> The town is recorded on the earliest-surviving map of Britain, the [[Gough Map]] made around 1360, which highlights its position on the main western north–south highway with distance markers to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Warrington]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Full record: Wigan |url=http://www.goughmap.org/settlements/7935/ |access-date=4 July 2013 |publisher=goughmap.org}}</ref>

[[Edward II of England|Edward II]] visited Wigan in 1323 in an effort to stabilise the region which had been the source of the [[Banastre Rebellion]] in 1315. Edward stayed in nearby [[Upholland]] Priory and held court in the town over a period of several days.<ref>{{Citation |title=Newsletter 3: Murder & Mayhem in Medieval Abram |date=April 1997 |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/content/News_Letters/news003.htm |access-date=20 December 2008 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref> During the medieval period Wigan expanded and prospered and in 1536, [[antiquarian]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described the town, saying "Wigan paved; as big as [[Warrington]] and better builded. There is one parish church amid the town. Some merchants, some artificers, some farmers".<ref name="British history" />

=== Civil War ===
In the [[English Civil War]], most people in the town were [[Cavalier|Royalists]] and [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]], a prominent and influential Royalist in the civil war, made Wigan his headquarters. His forces successfully captured Preston but failed in assaults on Manchester and Lancaster and two attempts to capture Bolton. Abandoning attempts to secure Lancashire, he took his forces to the Isle of Man to secure his holdings there. The Earl of Derby was absent when Wigan fell,<ref name="British history" /> despite fortifications built around the town, Wigan was captured by [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces on 1 April 1643, the takeover was complete in two hours and the town was pillaged before the defences were broken down and the Parliamentarians retreated. In 1648, Royalist forces under [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton]], occupied Wigan after they had been defeated by [[Oliver Cromwell]] at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]]. The soldiers looted the town as they retreated to Warrington, and afterwards, it experienced pestilence. Cromwell himself described Wigan as "a great and poor town, and very malignant".<ref name="British history" />

[[File:Tyldesley monument, Wigan.jpg|thumb|180px|Wigan Lane monument]]
The [[Battle of Wigan Lane]] was fought on 25 August 1651 during the [[Third English Civil War]], between 1,500 Royalists under the command of the [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|James Stanley, Earl of Derby]] marching to join the King at Worcester and 3,000 of the [[New Model Army]] under the command of Colonel [[Robert Lilburne]] hunting them. Lilburne arrived at Wigan to find the Royalists leaving to march towards Manchester but with his force consisting mostly of cavalry recognised it would be dangerous to engage in the narrow lanes around the town and decided to wait for his foot soldiers to arrive and flank the town. The Royalists seeing an opportunity to engage the divided force turned around to engage but Lilburne decided to hold his ground deploying cavalry on Wigan Lane and infantry in the hedgerows to the sides, The Royalists made several charges but after two hours were unable to break the Parliamentarian line and were forced to flee after being overwhelmed by superior numbers. Although Stanley was injured he managed to find refuge in the town.<ref name="civilwarwigan">{{Citation |last=Adrian Morris |title=The Battle of Wigan Lane |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#Civil |access-date=20 November 2008 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref> David Craine states, "those who did not fall in the fighting [were] hunted to their death through the countryside".<ref>{{Citation |last=Craine |first=D. |title=Manannan's Isle |year=1956 |publisher=The Manx Museum and National Trust}}</ref> A monument on Wigan Lane marks the place where [[Sir Thomas Tyldesley]] a Major General commanding the Royalist troops fell, it was erected 28 years after the battle in 1679 by Alexander Rigby, Tyldesley's standard bearer.<ref name="civilwarwigan" />

=== Industrial Revolution ===
Wigan was described by [[Celia Fiennes]], a traveller, in 1698 as "a pretty market town built of stone and brick".<ref>{{Citation |last=Morris |first=Adrian |title=The Heritage of Wigan |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html |access-date=1 August 2009 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref> In 1720, the [[moot hall]] was rebuilt, funded by the members of the borough. It was used as the town hall and the earliest reference to it dates from the 15th century.<ref name="British history" /><ref name="mayor's history">{{Citation |last=Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council |title=Mayors Handbook&nbsp;– Looking Back&nbsp;– A Brief History |url=http://www.wigan.gov.uk/Services/CouncilDemocracy/Mayoralty/MayorsHandbook/HandbookLookingBack.htm |access-date=1 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707194106/http://www.wigan.gov.uk/Services/CouncilDemocracy/Mayoralty/MayorsHandbook/HandbookLookingBack.htm |url-status=dead |publisher=Wigan.gov.uk |archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref> Prior to its final destruction in 1869, the hall was rebuilt in 1829.<ref name="mayor's history" /> Wigan's status as a centre for coal production, engineering and textiles in the 18th century led to the [[Douglas Navigation]] in the 1740s, the canalisation of part of the River Douglas and later the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The canal from Liverpool to Leeds was originally to serve Wigan on a spur, transporting cloth and food grown on the West Lancashire Plain to the Port of Liverpool. When construction restarted in the 1790s, after decades pause, as coal was rising in importance due to the progress of the Industrial Revolution. The route was altered at the request of mill owners, with the spur becoming the primary route and Wigan a hub for transport of coal from the Lancashire coal pits to Liverpool and Leeds.

As a [[mill town]], Wigan was an important centre of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]], but it was not until the 1800s that cotton factories began to spread into the town. This was due to a dearth of fast-flowing streams and rivers in the area, but by 1818 there were eight cotton mills in the Wallgate part of Wigan.<ref name="McNeil66">{{Harvard citation no brackets|McNeil|Nevell|2000|p=66.}}</ref> In 1818 William Woods introduced the first power [[loom]]s to the Wigan cotton mills. These mills swiftly became infamous for their dangerous and unbearable conditions, low pay and use of [[child labour]].<ref name="wiganhissoclatetextile">{{Citation |title=Later textiles in Wigan |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#LText |access-date=13 February 2012 |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}}</ref> As well as being a mill town, Wigan was also an important centre for coal production. It was recorded that in 1854 there were 54&nbsp;collieries in and around the town, about a sixth of all collieries in Lancashire.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|McNeil|Nevell|2000|p=65.}}</ref>

In the 1830s Wigan became one of the first towns in Britain to be served by [[Wigan Branch Railway|a railway]]; the line had connections to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and the [[Manchester and Liverpool Railway]].<ref name="McNeil66" /> This was the first in a network of public and [[industrial railway]]s which [[Old railway lines in Wigan|served the town]] during the period, much of which has since closed.<ref name="Thomas1986">{{Cite book |last=David St. John Thomas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8q8SAAAAMAAJ |title=A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: The North West |date=1986 |publisher=David & Charles |isbn=978-0-7153-6208-2}}</ref>  Wigan began to dominate as a cotton town in the late 19th century, and this lasted until the mid-20th century.<ref name="McNeil66" />


===Irish connections===
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2024}}
Wigan, being almost equal distance from Liverpool and Manchester received high immigration rates of Irish people in the 1800s following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)]]. According to ‘Wigan World’ website, Wigan's population (including Ince and Pemberton townships) doubled from 39,000 in 1851 to 77,000 in 1881 with the immigration of Irish to the town the biggest factor. The Irish mainly settled in the central areas of the town such as Scholes and Ince with the area around Belle Green Lane referred to as Irishtown. St Patrick's church in Scholes was built in 1847 on the back of huge swathes of Irish immigration. 

The local amateur rugby league club [[Wigan St Patricks]] has the Irish shamrock on the club badge with green and black being the club colours. 

The Wigan accent has even been affected by the great number of Irish coming to the town. The local word "moidered", known elsewhere as "[[:wikt:mithered#English|mithered]]", is said to have derived from pronouncing the word ''mithered'' in an Irish accent.

The Brian Boru Club in Ashton-in-Makerfield was established in 1889 and is the oldest Irish club in the UK.

=== 20th century ===
In 1911 the town was described as an "industrial town&nbsp;... occupying the greater part of the township, whilst its collieries, factories&nbsp;... fill the atmosphere with smoke".<ref name="British history" /> After the [[Second World War]] there was a boom followed by a slump from which Wigan's textile industry did not recover. While the town's cotton and coal industries declined in the 20th century, the engineering industry did not go into recession.<ref name="McNeil66" /> The last working cotton mill, [[May Mill, Pemberton|May Mill]], closed in 1980.<ref name="wiganhissoclatetextile" />
[[File:Wigan Market (geograph 5781841).jpg|thumb|Wigan Market in 2018]]
In 1937, Wigan was prominently featured in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' which dealt, in large part, with the living conditions of England's [[working poor]]. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Vallely |first=Paul |date=30 April 2003 |title=On the road again |work=The Independent |location=London |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article117176.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930192137/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article117176.ece |archive-date=30 September 2007 |quote=It seems funny to celebrate Orwell for highlighting all our bad points, but Wigan wouldn't be anywhere near as famous without him," says the Wigan Pier Experience's manager, Carole Tyldesley.

== Governance ==
[[File:Wigan Civic Centre.jpg|thumb|Wigan Civic Centre]]
Since 2004, the town of Wigan has been divided between five of the twenty-five [[ward (politics)|wards]] of the metropolitan borough, each returning three councillors to the 75-member borough council. The five wards are: Douglas, Pemberton, Wigan Central, Wigan West and [[Worsley Mesnes]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ward Boundaries |url=http://www.wigan.gov.uk/pub/council/maps/wardmap.htm |access-date=22 February 2009 |publisher=Metropolitan Borough of Wigan}}</ref> The metropolitan council provides the local services.<ref>{{Citation |last=Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council |title=Article 1&nbsp;– The Constitution |url=http://www.wigan.gov.uk/Services/CouncilDemocracy/Constitution/Article1.htm |access-date=1 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113143857/http://www.wigan.gov.uk/Services/CouncilDemocracy/Constitution/Article1.htm |url-status=dead |publisher=Wigan.gov.uk |archive-date=13 November 2007}}</ref>

At the Norman Conquest, the settlement of Wigan was part of the larger parish of Wigan, the majority of which was within the hundred of [[Newton le Willows|Newton]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Farrer|Brownbill|1911|pp=57–68}}</ref> On 26 August 1246, Wigan was granted a Royal Charter, making the town a free borough.<ref name="British history" /> This happened after the granting of royal charters began in the 13th Century as a way of establishing corporations and defining their privileges and purpose. In [[Lancashire]], [[Liverpool]] was granted in 1207, [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] in 1230 followed by Manchester in 1301.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{Citation |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzt2w.htm |df=dmy |access-date=9 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144311/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzt2w.htm |url-status=dead |at=Place Names T to W |publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office |archive-date=18 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Cooper|2005|p=12.}}</ref> As a borough, Wigan was represented in the [[Model Parliament]] from 1295 to 1306 by two [[Burgess (word)|burgesses]]&nbsp;– [[Freedom of the City|freemen]] of the borough.<ref>{{Citation |title=A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons |date=November 2006 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g03.pdf |page=2 |access-date=1 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217192940/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g03.pdf |url-status=dead |publisher=Parliament.uk |archive-date=17 December 2008}}</ref> The Charter allowed taxes to be made on transactions made in the borough by tradesmen and permitted the local burgesses to establish a [[guild]] that would regulate trade in the borough. Non-members of the guild were not allowed to do business in the borough without permission from the burgesses.<ref name="British history" /> It is thought that when the Charter was reconfirmation in 1350 it was changed, allowing the election of a mayor of Wigan for the first time. Three burgesses were elected to be presented to the lord of the manor who would choose one man to be mayor for a year.<ref name="British history" />

There was a rivalry between the lords of the manor and borough. The lord of the manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry continued in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging the right of the burgesses to hold markets, believing it should be the right of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did so because they felt they were fulfilling the duties of the lord: to improve waste and [[common land]] and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing some power between the two parties.<ref name="British history" />

Under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], the town was reformed and was given a [[justice of the peace|commission of the peace]]. The borough was divided into five [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] with a town council of forty members: two [[alderman|aldermen]] and six [[councillor]]s representing each ward. Rectors from the local parish church were the lords of the manor since records began until 2 September 1861. On this date, the borough corporation bought the rights associated with the lordship.<ref name="British history" /> The [[Local Government Act 1888]] constituted all [[municipal borough]]s with a population of 50,000 or more as "[[county borough]]s", exercising both borough and county powers. Wigan accordingly became a county borough on 1 April 1889, giving it independence from Lancashire County Council. Ward boundaries were altered, and the county borough was divided into ten wards, each electing one alderman and three councillors. The former area of [[Pemberton Urban District]] was annexed to the [[County Borough of Wigan]] in 1904, adding four extra wards to the borough.<ref name="British history" /> In 1974 the County Borough of Wigan was abolished and its former area became part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer" /> The current [[Wigan Town Hall]] was opened by the [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] in November 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Royal Visits to Wigan |url=https://www.wigan.gov.uk/Docs/PDF/Resident/Leisure/Museums-and-archives/archives/Royal-visits/Royal-Visits-to-Wigan.pdf |access-date=6 August 2020 |publisher=Wigan Council}}</ref> In April 2011, the borough along with the entirety of the county of Greater Manchester became one of 10 constituent councils of the [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Association of Greater Manchester Authorities |author-link=Association of Greater Manchester Authorities |date=March 2010 |title=Greater Manchester Combined Authority Final Scheme |url=http://www.agma.gov.uk/cms_media/files/greater_manchester_combined_authority_final_scheme.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216012318/http://www.agma.gov.uk/cms_media/files/greater_manchester_combined_authority_final_scheme.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2010 |access-date=30 March 2010 |publisher=agma.gov.uk}}</ref>

In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this slight increase in the middle classes of Wigan was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 38.7% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease in the working class goes against the trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.<ref>{{Citation |title=Wigan social class |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_SOC&data_cube=N_RGSOC_G&u_id=10109206&c_id=10001043&add=Y |access-date=8 December 2008 |publisher=Vision of Britain}}</ref>

At the 2001 UK census, 87.7% of Wigan's residents reported themselves as being Christian, 0.3% Muslim, 0.2% Hindu, and 0.1% Buddhist.

===Road===
Wigan lies on the meeting point of two [[Primary status|primary]] [[A roads in Great Britain|A roads]], the [[A49 road|A49]] and [[A577 road|A577]], which link to the [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[M61 motorway|M61]] and [[M58 motorway]]s. Increased traffic in recent years, encouraged by retail development, has resulted in very congested main roads for most of the day. This situation is linked to the town's geography, with river valleys and railway lines impeding road improvement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Rail===
There are two railway stations in Wigan town centre: [[Wigan North Western]] and [[Wigan Wallgate]]. North Western is on the north–south [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] [[West Coast Main Line]]. [[Avanti West Coast]] provides express trains to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]], [[Lancaster railway station|Lancaster]], [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]], [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow Central station|Glasgow]]. [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] operates trains to [[Preston railway station|Preston]] and [[Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool North]] and a regular local service along the line to [[St Helens Central railway station|St Helens]] and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Station Facilities: Wigan North Western (WGN) |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/wgn/details.html |access-date=15 September 2009 |publisher=[[National Rail]]}}</ref>

Wigan Wallgate serves lines running east and west from Wigan. Northern operate trains to [[Southport railway station|Southport]] and [[Kirkby railway station|Kirkby]], with connections to [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] and the [[Merseyrail]] system. Frequent local services also operate, in co-operation with [[Transport for Greater Manchester|TfGM]], to [[Bolton railway station|Bolton]] and [[Manchester]], with most trains from Wigan continuing through to other destinations such as [[Manchester Airport station|Manchester Airport]], [[Stockport railway station|Stockport]] and [[Rochdale railway station|Rochdale]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Station Facilities: Wigan Wallgate (WGW) |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/WGW/details.html |access-date=15 September 2009 |publisher=[[National Rail]]}}</ref> [[Pemberton railway station|Pemberton station]] serves the Pemberton area of the town.<ref>{{Citation |title=Station Facilities: Pemberton (PEM) |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/pem/details.html |access-date=15 September 2009 |publisher=[[National Rail]]}}</ref>

===Bus and tram===
A [[Horsecar|horse tramway]] was built in 1880 by the ''Wigan Corporation'' and leased to a succession of private companies to operate services to Pemberton, Aspull and towards Standish.<ref>Stretch, E. K. (1978). ''The tramways of Wigan''. MTMS, Manchester</ref> Steam tram operation was introduced quickly, but the network always struggled to pay its way and just after the start of the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric tramcar operation. However, the network was saddled with a mix of [[standard gauge]] and [[narrow gauge]] lines, reducing efficiency and increasing costs; the last of the [[Wigan Corporation Tramways]] were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses, which had begun as 'feeder' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be faster and more flexible. [[Trolleybuses]] were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931.{{Citation needed |date= January 2019}}

[[File:The new 2018 Wigan Bus Station.jpg|thumb|left|The redeveloped [[Wigan bus station]] in 2018]]
The town's tram, trolleybus and bus fleet was always painted in crimson and off-white colours, with ornate gold lining out until the outbreak of World War II. The buses were notable in that they never carried exterior advertisements, with the town's crest occupying the space between decks where other bus operators placed adverts; they carried two green lights on the front, to enable the town's ratepayers to see at night which was one of the town's own buses and not one of those of a competitor.<ref>Leyland Society (2003).
