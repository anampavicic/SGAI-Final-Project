With a documented history of at least 2,500 years, a succession of people and empires have vied for control over all or parts of this territory. The territory came under the rule of the [[Qing dynasty]] in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Since 1949 and the [[Chinese Civil War]], it has been part of the People's Republic of China.

The general region of Xinjiang has been known by many different names throughout time. These names include [[Altishahr]], the historical [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] name for the southern half of the region referring to "the six cities" of the [[Tarim Basin]], as well as Khotan, Khotay, [[Chinese Tartary]], High Tartary, East Chagatay (it was the eastern part of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]), [[Moghulistan]] ("land of the Mongols"), Kashgaria, Little Bokhara, [[Serindia]] (due to Indian cultural influence){{sfnp|Tyler|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEzNwgtiVQ0C&pg=PA3 3]}} and, in Chinese, ''Xiyu'' ({{lang|zh|西域}}), meaning "[[Western Regions]]".{{sfnp|Hill|2009|pp=xviii, 60}}

Between the 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD, the Han Empire established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] or Xiyu Protectorate ({{lang|zh-hant|西域都護府}}) in an effort to secure the profitable routes of the [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{cite book|first = Susan|last = Whitfield|author-link = Susan Whitfield|title = The Silk Road: trade, travel, war and faith|url=https://archive.org/details/aurelsteinonsilk0000whit|url-access = registration|year = 2004|publisher = Serindia Publications|page = [https://archive.org/details/aurelsteinonsilk0000whit/page/27 27]|isbn = 978-1-932476-11-8}}</ref> The Western Regions during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] era were known as ''Qixi'' ({{lang|zh-hant|磧西}}).

The Tang Empire had established the ''[[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]]'' or ''Anxi Protectorate'' ({{lang|zh-hant|安西都護府}}) in 640 to control the region.

During the [[Qing dynasty]], the northern part of Xinjiang, [[Dzungaria]] was known as Zhunbu ({{lang|zh-hant|準部}}, "[[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] region") and the Southern Tarim Basin was known as ''Huijiang'' ({{lang|zh|回疆}}, "Muslim Frontier"). Both regions merged after Qing dynasty suppressed the [[Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas]] in 1759 and became the region of "Xiyu Xinjiang" ({{lang|zh-hant|西域新疆}}, literally "Western Regions' New Frontier"), later simplified as "Xinjiang" ({{lang|zh-hant|新疆}}; [[Chinese postal romanization|formerly romanized]] as "Sinkiang").

In 1955, Xinjiang Province was renamed "Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region". The name that was originally proposed was simply "Xinjiang Autonomous Region" because that was the name for the imperial territory. This proposal was not well-received by Uyghurs in the Communist Party, who found the name colonialist in nature since it meant "new territory". [[Saifuddin Azizi]], the first chairman of Xinjiang, registered his strong objections to the proposed name with [[Mao Zedong]], arguing that "autonomy is not given to mountains and rivers. It is given to particular nationalities." Some Uyghur Communists proposed the name "[[Tian Shan]] Uyghur Autonomous Region" instead. The Han Communists in the central government denied the name Xinjiang was colonialist and denied that the central government could be colonialists both because they were communists and because China was a victim of colonialism. However, due to the Uyghur complaints, the administrative region would be named "Xinjiang ''Uygur'' Autonomous Region".{{sfnp|Bovingdon|2010|p=199}}<ref name="Jacobs">{{cite podcast |url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-39-ethnicity-tibet-and-xinjiang-in-the-prc/id1337064684?i=1000446900247|title= Episode 39: Ethnicity, Tibet, and Xinjiang in the PRC|website=podcasts.apple.com|publisher=Beyond Huaxia: A College History of China and Japan|host=Justin M.

Xinjiang consists of two main geographically, historically and ethnically distinct regions with different historical names, Dzungaria north of the Tianshan Mountains and the Tarim Basin south of the Tianshan Mountains, before Qing China unified them into one political entity called Xinjiang Province in 1884. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling, nomadic [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] Dzungar people, while the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, Turkic-speaking Muslim farmers, now known as the Uyghurs, who were governed separately until 1884. 

The Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tian Shan and the Turkic Muslim area south of the Tian Shan and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69 69]}} However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70 70]}} The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA67 67]}} During the Qing rule, no sense of "regional identity" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA77 77]}}

In the late 19th century, it was still being proposed by some people that two separate regions be created out of Xinjiang, the area north of the Tianshan and the area south of the Tianshan, while it was being argued over whether to turn Xinjiang into a province.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78 78]}}

Xinjiang is a large, sparsely populated area, spanning over 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> (comparable in size to [[Iran]]), which takes up about one sixth of the country's territory. Xinjiang borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and [[India]]'s [[Leh district]] in [[Ladakh]] to the south, [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] provinces to the east, [[Mongolia]] ([[Bayan-Ölgii Province|Bayan-Ölgii]], [[Govi-Altai Province|Govi-Altai]] and [[Khovd Province]]s) to the east, [[Russia]]'s [[Altai Republic]] to the north and [[Kazakhstan]] ([[Almaty Region|Almaty]] and [[East Kazakhstan Region]]s), [[Kyrgyzstan]] ([[Issyk-Kul Region|Issyk-Kul]], [[Naryn Region|Naryn]] and [[Osh Region]]s), [[Tajikistan]]'s [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]], [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Badakhshan Province]] and [[Pakistan]]'s [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] to the west.

The east-west chain of the Tian Shan separate Dzungaria in the north from the Tarim Basin in the south. Dzungaria is a dry steppe and the Tarim Basin contains the massive [[Taklamakan Desert]], surrounded by oases. In the east is the [[Turpan Depression]]. In the west, the Tian Shan split, forming the [[Ili River]] valley.

The earliest inhabitants of the region encompassing modern day Xinjiang were genetically of [[Ancient North Eurasian]] and [[East Asian people|Northeast Asian]] origin, with later geneflow from during the [[Bronze Age]] linked to the expansion of early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-Europeans]]. These population dynamics gave rise to a heterogeneous demographic makeup.

The Tarim population was therefore always notably diverse, reflecting a complex history of admixture between people of [[Ancient North Eurasian]], [[South Asia]]n and [[East Asian people|Northeast Asian]] descent. The [[Tarim mummies]] have been found in various locations in the Western Tarim Basin such as [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], the [[Xiaohe Cemetery|Xiaohe Tomb complex]] and [[Qäwrighul culture|Qäwrighul]]. These mummies have been previously suggested to have been Tocharian or Indo-European speakers, but recent evidence suggest that the earliest mummies belonged to a distinct population unrelated to Indo-European pastoralists and spoke an unknown language, probably a [[language isolate]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Fan|last2=Ning|first2=Chao|last3=Scott|first3=Ashley|last4=Fu|first4=Qiaomei|last5=Bjørn|first5=Rasmus|last6=Li|first6=Wenying|last7=Wei|first7=Dong|last8=Wang|first8=Wenjun|last9=Fan|first9=Linyuan|last10=Abuduresule|first10=Idilisi|last11=Hu|first11=Xingjun|date=November 2021|title=The genomic origins of the Bronze Age Tarim Basin mummies|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=599|issue=7884|pages=256–261|doi=10.1038/s41586-021-04052-7|issn=1476-4687|pmc=8580821|pmid=34707286|bibcode=2021Natur.599..256Z|quote=Using qpAdm, we modelled the Tarim Basin individuals as a mixture of two ancient autochthonous Asian genetic groups: the ANE, represented by an Upper Palaeolithic individual from the Afontova Gora site in the upper Yenisei River region of Siberia (AG3) (about 72%), and ancient Northeast Asians, represented by Baikal_EBA (about 28%) (Supplementary Data 1E and Fig. 3a).

The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Later Liang]] and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liáng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success. After the final reunification of Northern China under the [[Northern Wei]] empire, its protectorate controlled what is now the southeastern region of Xinjiang. Local states such as Shule, [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Guizi]] and [[Qiemo County|Qiemo]] controlled the western region, while the central region around Turpan was controlled by [[Gaochang]], remnants of a state ([[Northern Liang]]) that once ruled part of what is now Gansu province in northwestern China.

After the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia was destroyed by the Kirghiz in 840, branches of the Uyghurs established themselves in [[Gaochang|Qocha]] (Karakhoja) and [[Beshbalik]] (near present-day Turfan and Ürümqi). The Uyghur state remained in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, although it was ruled by foreign overlords. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam. The Uyghur state in Eastern Xinjiang, initially [[Manichaeism|Manichean]], later converted to [[Buddhism]].

Remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]] from [[Manchuria]] entered Xinjiang in 1132, fleeing rebellion by the neighboring [[Jurchens]]. They established a new empire, the [[Qara Khitai]] (Western Liao), which ruled the Kara-Khanid and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although [[Khitan language|Khitan]] and Chinese were the primary administrative languages, Persian and Uyghur were also used.<ref>''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World'', p. 94</ref>

Present-day Xinjiang consisted of the Tarim Basin and Dzungaria and was originally inhabited by Indo-European Tocharians and Iranian Sakas who practiced Buddhism and [[Zoroastrianism]].

After [[Genghis Khan]] unified Mongolia and began his advance west the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi region offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom; Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Qara Khitai]] in 1218. Xinjiang was a stronghold of [[Ögedei Khan]] and later came under the control of his descendant, [[Kaidu]]. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule ended.

During the Mongol Empire era the [[Yuan dynasty]] vied with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] for rule of the region and the latter controlled most of it. After the Chagatai Khanate divided into smaller [[khanate]]s during the mid-14th century, the politically-fractured region was ruled by a number of Persianized Mongol Khans, including those from [[Moghulistan]] (with the assistance of local [[Dughlats|Dughlat]] emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan) and Kashgaria. These leaders warred with each other and the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxiana]] to the west and the [[Oirats]] to the east: the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and China. During the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.

The Mongolian Dzungars were the collective identity of several Oirat tribes which formed and maintained, one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered Dzungaria, extending from the western [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day Eastern Kazakhstan and from present-day Northern Kyrgyzstan to Southern [[Siberia]]. Most of the region was renamed "Xinjiang" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire, which existed from the early 17th to the mid-18th century.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Physical Remains of the Zunghar Legacy in Central Eurasia: Some Notes from the Field |journal=Paper Presented at the Social and Environmental Changes on the Mongolian Plateau Workshop, Canberra, ACT, Australia |last1=Haines |first1=R Spencer |date=2016 |publisher=The Australian National University }}</ref>

The sedentary Turkic Muslims of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the Chagatai Khanate and the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongols in Dzungaria ruled the Dzungar Khanate. The [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of [[Muhammad]], had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as rulers of the Tarim Basin during the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two Khoja factions: the Afaqi (White Mountain) and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain). The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi and the [[Afaq Khoja]] invited the [[5th Dalai Lama]] (the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]) to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The Dalai Lama then called on his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on the invitation. The Dzungar Khanate conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler. After converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously-[[Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] believed that the "infidel Kalmuks" (Dzungars) built Buddhist monuments in their region.<ref name="GibbLewis1998">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers|author4=Charles Pellat|author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677|access-date=10 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101193741/https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and [[Hami|Kumul]] oases then submitted to the Qing dynasty and asked China to free them from the Dzungars; the Qing accepted their rulers as vassals. They warred against the Dzungars for decades before defeating them; Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] then conducted the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly eradicating them and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother, Khoja Jihan, from Dzungar imprisonment and appointed them to rule the Tarim Basin as Qing vassals. The Khoja brothers reneged on the agreement, declaring themselves independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader [[Emin Khoja]] crushed their revolt, and by 1759 China controlled Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin.{{sfnp|Adle|2003|p=203|loc="By the autumn of 1759, the entire periphery of the Tarim basin had been pacified"}}

The [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty gained control of eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar–Qing Wars|long struggle with the Dzungars]] which began during the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate over the next two years, and many Han Chinese and [[Hui people|Hui]] moved into the pacified areas.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=98}}

The native Dzungar Oirat Mongols suffered greatly from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous [[smallpox]] epidemic.

Han and Hui merchants were initially only allowed to trade in the Tarim Basin; their settlement in the Tarim Basin was banned until the 1830 [[Āfāqī Khoja Holy War|Muhammad Yusuf Khoja invasion]], when the Qing rewarded merchants for fighting off Khoja by allowing them to settle in the basin.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA113 113]}} The Uyghur Muslim [[Sayyid]] and [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] rebel of the [[Afaqi]] suborder, [[Jahangir Khoja]] was [[Lingchi|sliced to death (Lingchi)]] in 1828 by the Manchus for [[Āfāqī Khoja Holy War#Military expeditions with the support of Khoqand|leading a rebellion against the Qing]]. According to [[Robert Montgomery Martin]], many Chinese with a variety of occupations were settled in Dzungaria in 1870; in Turkestan (the Tarim Basin), however, only a few Chinese merchants and garrison soldiers were interspersed with the Muslim population.{{sfnp|Martin|1847 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SV9AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA21 21]}}

The 1765 [[Uqturpan County|Ush]] rebellion by the Uyghurs against the Manchu began after Uyghur women were raped by the servants and son of Manchu official Su-cheng.{{sfnp|Millward |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ir2CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA124 124]}} It was said that "Ush Muslims had long wanted to sleep on [Sucheng and son's] hides and eat their flesh" because of the months-long abuse.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA108 108]}} The Manchu emperor ordered the massacre of the Uyghur rebel town; Qing forces enslaved the Uyghur children and women, and killed the Uyghur men.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA109 109]}} Sexual abuse of Uyghur women by Manchu soldiers and officials triggered deep Uyghur hostility against Manchu rule.{{sfnp|Millward |1998 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ir2CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206 206–207]}}

By the 1860s, Xinjiang had been under [[Xinjiang under Qing rule|Qing rule]] for a century. The region was captured in 1759 from the [[Dzungar Khanate]],<ref>Peter Perdue, China marches west: the Qing conquest of Central Eurasia.

Xinjiang was primarily semi-arid or desert and unattractive to non-trading [[Chinese Han|Han]] settlers, and others (including the Uyghurs) settled there.

The [[Dungan Revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan Revolt]] by the Muslim Hui and other [[Muslims|Muslim]] ethnic groups was fought in China's [[Shaanxi]], [[Ningxia]] and Gansu [[Provinces of China|provinces]] and in Xinjiang from 1862 to 1877. The conflict led to a reported 20.77&nbsp;million deaths due to migration and war, with many refugees dying of starvation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gxmzb.net/content/2019-05/16/content_1223.htm|title=回族|access-date=22 January 2021|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122170218/http://www.gxmzb.net/content/2019-05/16/content_1223.htm|archive-date=22 January 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2021}} Thousands of Muslim refugees from Shaanxi fled to Gansu; some formed battalions in eastern Gansu, intending to reconquer their lands in Shaanxi.

Beg settled in Kashgar, and soon controlled Xinjiang. Although he encouraged trade, built [[Caravanserai|caravansareis]], canals and other irrigation systems, his regime was considered harsh.

== Geography and geology ==
[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]
Xinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of China|political subdivision of China]], accounting for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases conducive to habitation accounting for 9.7 percent of Xinjiang's total area by 2015<ref name="oasis"/> at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]], respectively.

=== Mountain systems and basins ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}
Xinjiang is split by the Tian Shan mountain range ({{ug-textonly|تەڭرى تاغ}}, Tengri Tagh, Тәңри Тағ), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].

[[File:Fly over Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]
Other major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the Kunlun Mountains in the south (along the border with Tibet) and the Altai Mountains in the northeast (shared with Mongolia). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], an [[eight-thousander]] located {{convert|8611|m|ft}} above sea level in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].
[[File:Taklamakan desert.jpg|thumb|[[Taklamakan Desert]]]]
Much of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the Taklamakan Desert. North of it is the Turpan Depression, which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at {{convert|155|m|ft}} below sea level.

The Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.

The Tian Shan mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with Kashgar over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].

=== Mountain passes ===
From south to north, the mountain passes bordering Xinjiang are:

=== Geology ===
Xinjiang is geologically young. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the Tian Shan, [[Kunlun Shan]], and Pamir mountain ranges; said tectonics render it a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where [[Kazakhstania]] is geologically part of Kazakhstan, and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Center of the continent===
Xinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.

In 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of Ürümqi, [[Ürümqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the "center point of Asia". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web |title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1) |url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710 |archive-date=2 June 2016 |access-date=13 October 2013 |website=[[Confluence.org]]}}</ref>

=== Rivers and lakes ===
[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]
[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black [[Irtysh]] river in [[Burqin County]] is a famous spot for [[sightseeing]].]]
Having hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh–Karamay–Ürümqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern Dzungarian Basin.

[[File:LakeKanas.jpg|thumb|[[Kanas Lake]]]] 
Elsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the Tarim Basin, the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]]. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into [[Lake Manas]]. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of [[potassium]] fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.

=== Deserts ===
Deserts include:
* [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]], also known as ''Dzoosotoyn Elisen''
* [[Taklamakan Desert]]
* [[Kumtag Desert]], east of Taklamakan

=== Major cities ===
Due to water scarcity, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges in areas conducive to irrigated agriculture. It is in these belts where most of the region's cities are found.

A semiarid or desert climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'' or ''BWk'', respectively) prevails in Xinjiang. The entire region has great seasonal differences in temperature with cold winters. The Turpan Depression often records some of the hottest temperatures nationwide in summer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com.cn/cityintro/101130501.shtml? |script-title=zh:吐鲁番 – 气象数据 – 中国天气网|website=www.weather.com.cn|access-date=30 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172034/http://www.weather.com.cn/html/cityintro/101130501.shtml|archive-date=14 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> with air temperatures easily exceeding {{convert|40|°C}}.

Continuous [[permafrost]] is typically found in the Tian Shan starting at the elevation of about 3,500–3,700 m above sea level. Discontinuous [[alpine permafrost]] usually occurs down to 2,700–3,300 m, but in certain locations, due to the peculiarity of the [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]] and the microclimate, it can be found at elevations as low as 2,000 m.<ref>{{citation |contribution=Geocryology in Mt.

{{main|Xinjiang Time|Time in China#Xinjiang}}
Despite the province's easternmost point being more than {{Convert|1600|km}} west of Beijing, Xinjiang, like the rest of China, is officially in the [[UTC+8]] time zone, known by residents as Beijing Time.

Like all [[Politics of China|governing institutions in mainland China]], Xinjiang has a parallel party-government system. The [[Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Committee of the CCP]] acts as the top policy-formulation body, and exercises control over the Regional People's Government. The CCP Committee Secretary, generally a member of the Han ethnic group, outranks the Government Chairman, always an Uyghur. The Government Chairman typically serves as a Deputy Committee Secretary.<ref name=":42">{{Cite web |title=Decoding Chinese Politics |url=https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/decoding-chinese-politics |access-date=2 October 2023 |website=[[Asia Society]]}}</ref>

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]]; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, [[Taoism|Taoist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]], although many follow Islam as well, such as the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.<ref name=":5" />

Some Uyghur scholars claim descent from both the Turkic Uyghurs and the pre-Turkic Tocharians (or Tokharians, whose language was Indo-European); also, Uyghurs often have relatively-fair skin, hair and eyes and other Caucasoid physical traits.

In 2002, there were 9,632,600 males (growth rate of 1.0 percent) and 9,419,300 females (growth rate of 2.2 percent). The population overall growth rate was 1.09 percent, with 1.63 percent of [[birth rate]] and 0.54 percent [[mortality rate]].

The Qing began a [[migration to Xinjiang|process of settling Han, Hui, and Uyghur settlers into Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria) in the 18th century]]. At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in Southern Xinjiang.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=306}} A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30 percent Han and 60 percent Turkic and it dramatically shifted to 6 percent Han and 75 percent Uyghur in the 1953 census.

In general, Uyghurs are the majority in Southwestern Xinjiang, including the prefectures of Kashgar, Khotan, [[Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture|Kizilsu]] and Aksu (about 80 percent of Xinjiang's Uyghurs live in those four prefectures) as well as [[Turpan|Turpan Prefecture]], in Eastern Xinjiang. The Han are the majority in Eastern and Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria), including the cities of Ürümqi, [[Karamay]], [[Shihezi]] and the prefectures of [[Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Changjyi]], [[Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Bortala]], [[Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Bayin'gholin]], [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] (especially the cities of [[Kuytun|Kuitun]]) and [[Hami|Kumul]]. Kazakhs are mostly concentrated in [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili Prefecture]] in Northern Xinjiang. Kazakhs are the majority in the northernmost part of Xinjiang.

=== Roads ===
[[File:Karakorum-carretera-d08.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karakorum highway]]]]

In 2008, according to the Xinjiang Transportation Network Plan, the government has focused construction on State Road 314, Alar-Hotan Desert Highway, State Road 218, Qingshui River Line-Yining Highway and State Road 217, as well as other roads.

The construction of the first expressway in the mountainous area of Xinjiang began a new stage in its construction on 24 July 2007. The {{convert|56|km|abbr=on}} highway linking [[Sayram Lake]] and Guozi Valley in Northern Xinjiang area had cost 2.39 billion yuan. The expressway is designed to improve the speed of national highway 312 in northern Xinjiang. The project started in August 2006 and several stages have been fully operational since March 2007. Over 3,000 construction workers have been involved. The 700 m-long Guozi Valley Cable Bridge over the expressway is now currently being constructed, with the 24 main pile foundations already completed. Highway 312 national highway Xinjiang section, connects Xinjiang with China's east coast, [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]], plus some parts of [[Europe]]. It is a key factor in Xinjiang's economic development. The population it covers is around 40 percent of the overall in Xinjiang, who contribute half of the GDP in the area.

[[Zulfiya Abdiqadir]], head of the Transport Department was quoted as saying that 24,800,000,000 RMB had been invested into Xinjiang's road network in 2010 alone and, by this time, the roads covered approximately {{convert|152000|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ts">{{cite web |date=3 March 2011 |editor=Su Qingxia ({{lang|zh-hans|苏清霞}}) |title=祖丽菲娅·阿不都卡德尔代表：见证新疆交通事业的日益腾飞 |trans-title=Representative Zulfiya Abdiqadir: evidence that Xinjiang's transport projects are developing more with each passing day |url=http://news.ts.cn/content/2011-03/03/content_5636418.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224215419/http://news.ts.cn/content/2011-03/03/content_5636418.htm |archive-date=24 February 2017 |access-date=24 February 2017 |website=[[Tianshannet]] |language=zh-hans}}</ref>

Xinjiang's rail hub is Ürümqi. To the east, [[Lanzhou–Xinjiang railway|a conventional]] and [[Lanzhou–Xinjiang high-speed railway|a high-speed rail]] line runs through Turpan and Hami to [[Lanzhou]] in Gansu Province. A [[Ejin–Hami railway|third outlet to the east]] connects Hami and Inner Mongolia.

To the west, the [[Northern Xinjiang Railway|Northern Xinjiang]] runs along the northern footslopes of the Tian Shan range through Changji, Shihezi, Kuytun and [[Jinghe County|Jinghe]] to the Kazakh border at Alashankou, where it links up with the [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]]. Together, the Northern Xinjiang and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang lines form part of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge|Trans-Eurasian Continental Railway]], which extends from [[Rotterdam]], on the [[North Sea]], to [[Lianyungang]], on the [[East China Sea]]. The [[Northern Xinjiang railway]] provides additional rail transport capacity to Jinghe, from which the [[Jinghe–Yining–Khorgos railway]] heads into the Ili River Valley to [[Yining]], [[Huocheng County|Huocheng]] and [[Khorgos]], a second rail border crossing with Kazakhstan. The [[Kuytun–Beitun railway]] runs from Kuytun north into the [[Junggar Basin]] to Karamay and Beitun, near Altay.

In the south, the [[Southern Xinjiang railway]] from Turpan runs southwest along the southern footslopes of the Tian Shan into the Tarim Basin, with stops at Yanqi, Korla, [[Kuqa, Xinjiang|Kuqa]], Aksu, [[Maralbexi County|Maralbexi (Bachu)]], Artux and Kashgar. From Kashgar, the [[Kashgar–Hotan railway]], follows the southern rim of the Tarim to Hotan, with stops at [[Shule County|Shule]], [[Akto County|Akto]], [[Yengisar County|Yengisar]], [[Yarkant County|Shache (Yarkant)]], [[Kargilik Town|Yecheng (Karghilik)]], [[Karakax County|Moyu (Karakax)]].
