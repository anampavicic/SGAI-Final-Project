'''Campo Grande''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ˈkɐ̃pu ˈɡɾɐ̃dʒi|lang}}, {{lit|"Great Field"}}) is a city in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|central and western]] [[Regions of Brazil|region of Brazil]], [[Capital city|capital]] of the state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]. Historically a [[Fortification|stronghold]] of [[Separatism|separatists]] from the [[North]] and [[South]], founded by [[José Antônio Pereira]]. The city is planned in the middle of a vast [[Urban green space|green space]], with wide streets and tree-lined avenues with several gardens along the way. It is one of the most wooded cities in [[Brazil]], with 96.3% of houses in shade.<ref name="ibgePop2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2011/POP2011_DOU.pdf |page=120 |date=July 1, 2011 |trans-title=Population estimates in Brazilian municipalities |title=Estimativas demográficas em municipalidades brasileiras |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007090238/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2011/POP2011_DOU.pdf |archive-date=October 7, 2011 }}</ref>

The region where the city is located was in the past a waypoint for travellers who wanted to go from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] or [[Minas Gerais]] to northern [[Mato Grosso]] by land. In the early 1900s, a railway was completed, connecting Campo Grande to [[Corumbá]] on the [[Bolivia]]n border and to [[Bauru]], São Paulo. Also in the beginning of the 20th century, the Western Brazilian Army Headquarters was established in Campo Grande, making it an important military center.

With a [[population growth]] from 140,000 people in 1970 to 750,000 people in 2007, Campo Grande is the third largest [[urban center]] of the Center-West region, and the 17th largest city in the country. In 1977, the State of [[Mato Grosso]] was split into two, and Campo Grande became the capital of the new state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], comprising the southern portion of the former state. By that time, Campo Grande had long surpassed the latter's capital city of [[Cuiabá]] in population, which is unusual in Brazil, where most capitals are also the states' largest cities.

Today, the city has its own culture, which is a mixture of several ethnic groups, most notably immigrants from the [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] [[Okinawa prefecture|prefecture]] of [[Ryukyuans|Okinawa]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.overmundo.com.br/overblog/cultura-de-okinawa-sucursal-campo-grande |title=Japanese Okinawans in Campo Grande |access-date=2009-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210075242/http://www.overmundo.com.br/overblog/cultura-de-okinawa-sucursal-campo-grande |archive-date=2009-02-10 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Arab Brazilian|Middle Easterners]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/turismo/noticias/ult338u4376.shtml |title=Arab descent in Campo Grande |access-date=2009-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606111117/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/turismo/noticias/ult338u4376.shtml |archive-date=2011-06-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Armenian Brazilian|Armenians]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026220018/http://br.geocities.com/serraverde/campogrande/imigrantes.html Armenians in Campo Grande]</ref> [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese people]], [[German Brazilian|Germans]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]], [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spaniards]], and [[Paraguayan Brazilian|Paraguayans]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026220018/http://br.geocities.com/serraverde/campogrande/imigrantes.html  Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Paraguayan immigration to Campo Grande]</ref> finally mixed with [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] and [[White Brazilian|European Brazilian]]s from the Brazilian [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]] and [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] regions, its [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|native Amerindian peoples]] and [[Afro-Brazilian]]s.

==History==
Campo Grande started as a small village founded in 1877 by farmers José Antônio Pereira and Manoel Vieira de Sousa (a.k.a. Manoel Olivério), who came from [[Minas Gerais]] just after the end of the [[Paraguayan War]]. They founded the village, known at that time as Santo Antônio de Campo Grande, near the Serra de Maracaju cliffs, at the confluence of two streams named Prosa and Segredo (Portuguese for "conversation" and "secret," respectively), whose courses now coincide with two of the city's most important avenues. In the end of 1877, the founder built the village's first church. The roughly aligned houses formed the first street, known as Rua Velha (Old Street), today Rua 26 de Agosto (26 August Street). This street ended where today one finds a square in honor of the immigrants that later came to the city. In  1930, the city was the theater of a small conflict involving governmental forces, led by Getulio Vargas, and indigenous groups. The rebels seized large parts of the city until government reinforcement reached and ended the conflict.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026220018/http://br.geocities.com/serraverde/campogrande/imigrantes.html  Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Paraguayan immigration to Campo Grande]</ref>

The city started to develop relatively fast because of its privileged climate and location. These factors drew people from other regions of the country, especially the South, the Southeast and the Northeast regions. The settlement was officially recognized as a municipality by the State Government on August 26, 1899, and renamed Campo Grande.

==Geography==
[[File:Último suspiro do sol.jpg|thumb|Sunset in Campo Grande.]]

=== Vegetation ===
The vegetation in Campo Grande and Central Brazil is a tropical savanna called "[[Cerrado]]" that varies from pure grassland to a nearly closed canopy of medium height trees overlying grass. Since [[forest]] is the expected climax vegetation there, several theories have been given to explain the types of [[grassland]] present.

The most promising of these involve differences in soil properties, but only a few sites have been used for evaluation. The 1960s marked the beginning of the expansion of large-scale [[agriculture]] across the [[Cerrado]]. The state is one of the largest producers of [[soybean]]s in the world.

The municipality contains the {{convert|178|ha}} [[Matas do Segredo State Park]], created in 2000 to protect an area of ''[[cerrado]]'' forest.<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|Parque Estadual Matas do Segredo – IMASUL}}|language=pt|title=Parque Estadual Matas do Segredo|publisher=IMASUL: Instituto de Meio Ambiente de Mato Grosso do Sul|url=http://www.imasul.ms.gov.br/conservacao-ambiental/gestao-de-unidades-de-conservacao/unidades-de-conservacao-estaduais/parque-estadual-matas-do-segredo/|access-date=2016-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130112632/http://www.imasul.ms.gov.br/conservacao-ambiental/gestao-de-unidades-de-conservacao/unidades-de-conservacao-estaduais/parque-estadual-matas-do-segredo/|archive-date=2016-11-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Climate===
Campo Grande has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''), just slightly drier than a [[tropical monsoon climate]], with a mild appearance of cold [[air mass]]es on the southern edge of the [[tropics]]. It has semi-humid, hot summers, and notably seasonal, with a dry winter season from June through September, but without major irregularities in the precipitation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbmet.org.br/cbmet2010/artigos/549_52925.pdf|title=Análise das precipitações em alguns municípios de Mato Grosso do Sul|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219202048/http://www.sbmet.org.br/cbmet2010/artigos/549_52925.pdf|archive-date=2019-02-19|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/south-america/brazil/mato-grosso-do-sul/campo-grande-3912/|title=Campo Grande climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Campo Grande weather averages - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220063220/https://en.climate-data.org/south-america/brazil/mato-grosso-do-sul/campo-grande-3912/|archive-date=2019-02-20|url-status=live}}</ref> Its altitude a few hundred meters higher than in the surrounding [[swamp]]s and its location in the interior of [[South America]], gives a much more extreme climate than several Brazilian cities, although still moderate.

==Economy==
[[File:VA Belmar Campo Grande.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Campo Grande.]]
[[File:Horto_Florestal.jpg|thumb|right|A typical neighborhood in Campo Grande.]]
Most of the city's active economic labor is absorbed by the [[tertiary sector]] (commerce and services). In spite of that, the primary and secondary sectors, especially [[agribusiness]], still play an important role in the local economy. The farming of bovine [[livestock]] supplies local [[slaughterhouse]]s, which in turn allows Campo Grande to export meat to other states in [[Brazil]] and abroad. In addition to food processing and agribusiness, [[construction]] and non-metallic mineral processing are important. The area's most important crops are [[soy]], [[rice]] and [[manioc]]. Recently, [[sugar cane]] is becoming important as well. According to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], Campo Grande has a total of 11,657 commercial and 1,300 industrial enterprises.

The city's [[GDP]] was [[Brazilian real|R$]] 20,7 billion (about [[US$]] 9,59 billions) in 2013,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=500270&idtema=152&search=mato-grosso-do-sul%7Ccampo-grande%7Cproduto-interno-bruto-dos-municipios-2013|title=GDP|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Campo Grande, Brazil|year=2013|language=pt|access-date=2016-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512011937/http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=500270&idtema=152&search=mato-grosso-do-sul%7Ccampo-grande%7Cproduto-interno-bruto-dos-municipios-2013|archive-date=2016-05-12|url-status=live}}</ref> ranks as the richest city in the state, the third in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West region]] of the country, and the 33rd richest in Brazil (2013).

[[Per capita income]] was R$24.839 in 2013 (about US$11,511).<ref>{{cite book|title=IBGE|url=http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=500270&idtema=152&search=mato-grosso-do-sul%7Ccampo-grande%7Cproduto-interno-bruto-dos-municipios-2013|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Campo Grande, Brazil|year=2013|language=pt|access-date=2016-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512011937/http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=500270&idtema=152&search=mato-grosso-do-sul%7Ccampo-grande%7Cproduto-interno-bruto-dos-municipios-2013|archive-date=2016-05-12|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Education==
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. But [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are part of the official [[high school]] curriculum.

===Educational institutions===
The city has several [[University|universities]]. The most notable ones are:
* [[Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul]] (UFMS) (Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul);
* [http://www.uems.br Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul] (UEMS) (State University of Mato Grosso do Sul);
* [http://www.ucdb.br Universidade Católica Dom Bosco] (UCDB) (Dom Bosco Catholic University);
* [http://www.icges.edu.br/ Faculdade Campo Grande] (FCG) (Campo Grande College);
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090813074145/http://www.unaes.br/ Centro Universitário de Campo Grande] (UNAES) (Academic Center of Campo Grande).

==Transportation==

===International Airport===
[[File:Aeroporto_Internacional_de_Campo_Grande_-_panoramio_-_Rodrigo_Santos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Campo Grande International Airport|Campo Grande International Airport (CGR)]].]]
The operation of [[Campo Grande International Airport]] is shared with Campo Grande Air Force Base. The airport has two runways.
The airport can receive medium-sized jets such as the [[Boeing 737]] and the [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], but occasional operations of larger jets have occurred. Operations are mostly domestic, but there are also a few flights to [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]].

[[Campo Grande Air Force Base|Campo Grande Air Force Base - ALA5]], one of their most important bases of the [[Brazilian Air Force]], is located in Campo Grande.

===Railroad===
[[File:VA_Pq_das_Nações_Indígenas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Afonso Pena Avenue.]]
Campo Grande is served by a system of [[railway]] transport under administration of the Novoeste company, interconnecting with other cities in the state, in a line that goes from [[Bauru]] and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]] through Campo Grande all the way to [[Corumbá]] and on to [[Bolivia]]. This mode of transport has had significant effects on the transport infrastructure, allowing the export of products to other centres of production and consumption. Currently, no passenger services are operated, only freight trains.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

===Highways===
Three main federal highways intersect at Campo Grande. BR-262 links Campo Grande to [[Corumbá]] and [[Bolivia]] to the west, and the Brazilian [[State of São Paulo]] to the east. [[BR-163]] connects Campo Grande to Cuiabá and the Amazon region to the north, and to [[Dourados]] (which is {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=off}} from the Paraguayan border) to the south. BR-060 links Campo Grande to the state of [[Goiás]] and the national capital city of [[Brasília]] to the northeast. There are also several state highways converging there.{{cn|date=March 2023}}
