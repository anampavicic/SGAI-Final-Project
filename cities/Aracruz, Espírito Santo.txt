==History==
The [[municipality]]'s history begins in 1556, when two [[Jesuit]] priests (Braz Lourenço and Diogo Jácomo) founded [[Santa Cruz, Espírito Santo|Santa Cruz]], a town then called Aldeia Nova (''New Village''). Aldeia Nova later became known as Aldeia Velha (Old Village), since it didn't prosper as much as its neighbour, which then became known as Aldeia Nova, and is today called [[Nova Almeida, ES, Brazil|Nova Almeida]]. Aldeia Velha became emancipated as a municipality in 1848, and changed its name to Santa Cruz. In 1943, the municipality and its capital were both renamed Aracruz. However, the biggest economic driver at the time was ''[[Jacaranda|jacarandá]]'' wood, and Sauaçu held most of the [[wood processing]] plants (''serrarias''), so in 1948 the capital was moved to Sauaçu (also called Sauassu), and the capital's name went with it. Sauaçu then became known as Aracruz, and Aracruz reverted to its formal and present name, Santa Cruz.

Santa Cruz was founded at the mouth of the Piraquê-mirim and Piraquê-açu Rivers, as were a number of Amerindian tribes. After a visit from the Emperor [[Peter II of Brazil|Peter II]] who slept in Santa Cruz in 1860, he signed permission for 386 Italian families to settle in Santa Cruz, and those families founded Fazenda Nova Trento (New Trento Farm) around 1874. Other groups moved up the Piraquê-açu river to found Palmas Farm (''Fazenda das Palmas'') and [[Santa Teresa, ES, Brazil|Santa Teresa]]. At this time [[coffee]] and [[cassava]] plantations were common.

Another large wave of Italian immigrants began coming around 1872, when a ship called ''Sofia'' arrived bringing 386 Italians from the region of [[Trento]]. Those went on to found Nova Trento Colony.

On November 25, 2022, [[Aracruz school shootings|a shooting spree]] occurred at two schools in Aracruz: the Primo Bitti State Elementary and Middle School, a public school; and the Praia de Coqueiral Educational Center, a private school. Four people were killed, and 12 others were injured. The suspect, a 16-year-old former student at the public school, was arrested approximately four hours later.<ref name=AP.Shooting>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/article/shootings-education-caribbean-brazil-9829399a1b55a1c4f54b00bcd35d80c1|title=Shootings at Brazil schools leave 3 dead, 13 wounded|publisher=Associated Press|last=Bridi|first=Carla|date=November 25, 2022|accessdate=November 25, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/25/americas/brazil-school-shooting-intl-latam/index.html|title=At least 3 people killed and 11 others injured in Brazil school shootings|publisher=CNN|last=Mendonca|first=Duarte|date=November 25, 2022|accessdate=November 25, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Filho de PM, atirador usou armas e carro do pai em Aracruz, diz polícia |url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2022/11/25/quem-e-suspeito-atentado-escolas-de-aracruz-es.htm |access-date=2022-11-26 |website=noticias.uol.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Aracruz: Atentado a tiros em duas escolas no ES deixam ao menos 3 mortos |url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2022/11/25/atiradores-invadem-e-atacam-2-escolas-no-es-policia-confirma-mortes.htm |access-date=2022-11-25 |website=noticias.uol.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref>

==Demographics==
According to the IBGE population estimate for 2016, Aracruz is the tenth most populated municipality in [[Espírito Santo]], with 96.746 residents.

==Population==
Today Aracruz is home to roughly 1500 Native Americans divided into six reservations: Caieiras Velha, Comboios, Irajá, Pau Brasil, Tekoá and Três Palmeiras. Only in the last couple of decades have they been able to secure their land here, as many problems with the local paper industry greatly prolonged their land struggles. Those Amerindians belong to two tribes: the [[Tupiniquim]] and the [[Guarani people|Guarani]]. The Native Americans in Aracruz Municipality no longer speak their native languages, but they hold on to their traditional subsistence farming and handcraft trade.
