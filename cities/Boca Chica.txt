==History==
The community of Boca Chica was founded in 1779 during the government of Brigadier Don Isidro Peralta y Rojas with the name of San José de los Llanos. Boca Chica was later developed by [[List of people from the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] businessman and politician [[Juan Bautista Vicini Burgos]], who established sugar plantations there in the early 1900s. Vicini was very fond of the place but the golden era of Boca Chica came decades later in the 1950s, when dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] ordered the construction of a modern hotel named "Hotel Hamaca", which subsequently became an icon in the area. The hotel became more famous after Trujillo granted [[political asylum]] to the dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]]. During the 1950s and the 1960s, prominent families of the Dominican Republic built several summer properties along the beach only accessible by private transportation.

After the 1970s, the beach became increasingly more popular and public transportation helped to make Boca Chica a very crowded place; it was no longer a secluded beach for the elites as it had been during the '50s and '60s. The Hamaca hotel was closed after [[Hurricane David]] in 1979, and it remained closed and abandoned for years which caused an economic decline in the area. It was later reopened and the public beach remains popular among people of different classes.

==Geography==
Boca Chica's proximity to the city of [[Santo Domingo]], its clear blue waters and white sand have made it one of the busiest beaches in the Dominican Republic, especially on weekends and [[holidays]], because it is 30&nbsp;km away from Santo Domingo. Boca Chica has two small islands Los Pinos, which were made with sand from the dredging of the Andrés port in the 1950s and La Matica and La Piedra, mangrove cays, submerged vascular plants and habitat for various species of birds. The beach has a natural breakwater, as well as a fresh water spring, coming from the Brujuelas underground river.

==Characteristics==

The short distance from the capital city (19 miles), the crystalline waters and the white sands turned Boca Chica into the most crowded beach of the Dominican Republic, especially on weekends and holidays. Boca Chica beach has immaculate fine sand. You can walk in the water and the depth will barely change, the water will be to your waist (or a little bit over) all the time. Boca Chica has two small islands, Los Pinos and La Matica, and two [[marina]]s.

There are several bars, restaurants, pizza stands, souvenirs stalls and loud music throughout most of the day; all this along the beach sand very close to the shore. In the evening, Boca Chica transforms itself into a town of party bars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article1946928.html |title=In Dominican Republic seaside village, a virtual supermarket of sex |access-date=2013-02-03}}</ref>
