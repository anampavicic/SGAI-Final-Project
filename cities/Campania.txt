The Campania's hinterland was inhabited from the beginning of the 1st millennium BC by the [[Osci]], [[Samnites]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], while between the 8th and 7th centuries BC its coastal areas were colonised by the [[ancient Greeks]] ([[Magna Graecia]]). At that time, [[Capua]] was Campania's leading city, while [[Naples]] was an anomaly, being predominantly Greek-speaking.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gradogna|first=Sergio|date=2010-02-10|title=Non solo greci e romani, la Campania degli altri popoli|url=https://www.charmenapoli.it/storia/etruschi-sanniti-lucani-oscii-campania-coloni/|access-date=2022-02-19|website=Charme|language=it-IT|archive-date=19 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220219150547/https://www.charmenapoli.it/storia/etruschi-sanniti-lucani-oscii-campania-coloni/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Campania is rich in culture, especially with regard to food, music, architecture, and archaeological and ancient sites—such as Pompeii, Herculaneum, [[Oplontis]], [[Paestum]], [[Aeclanum]], [[Stabiae]], and [[Velia]]. The name "Campania" is derived from Latin; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew the region as ''Campania felix'' ("fertile countryside" or "happy countryside"). The rich natural beauty of Campania makes it important to the tourism industry: the city of Naples, the Amalfi Coast, Mount Vesuvius, and the islands of Capri and [[Ischia]] have long been major attractions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/campania/|publisher=LifeInItaly.com|title=Campania: Gateway to Southern Italy|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009|archive-date=15 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815013232/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/campania|url-status=live}}</ref>

The region known today as ''Campania'' was inhabited from at least the beginning of the 1st millennium BC by several  [[Oscan language|Oscan-speaking]] [[Italic tribes]]: the [[Osci]], the [[Opici]], the [[Aurunci]], the [[Ausones]], the [[Sidicini]], the [[Hirpini]], the [[Caudini]], the [[Oenotrians]], the [[Campanians]] (after whom the region is named) and the [[Lucanians]] (who inhabited the southernmost part of Campania, known in ancient times as [[Lucania]], roughly where modern-day [[province of Salerno|Salerno]] is).<ref>(Giacomo Devoto, Gli antichi italici, Firenze, Vallecchi, 1931, p.118).</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.instoria.it/home/italia_antiqua_XV.htm|publisher=InStoria.it|title=Italia Antiqua – XV, Campania|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009|archive-date=27 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227225736/http://www.instoria.it/home/italia_antiqua_XV.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Many of these [[tribe]]s lived in [[Subsistence agriculture|simple]] [[agro-town]]s. Not much is known about the [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European tribes]] that had lived in the region earlier; they were probably not as technologically or culturally advanced as the Oscans, and any who still flourished had become fully Oscanised by the middle of the first millennium BC.

Between the 9th and 6th centuries BC, the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] from [[Central Italy]] established [[colony|colonies]] in the Campanian Plains (the inland territories that today are the [[province of Caserta|provinces of Caserta]] and [[province of Naples|Naples]]), as well as in the regions of [[Agro Nocerino-Sarnese]] and Agro Picentino (which today are in the [[province of Salerno]]). There, they essentially replicated their [[Etruscan cities|''Dodecapolis'' (twelve cities)]] political model, founding the cities of ''Hyria'' (modern-day [[Nola]]), ''Irnthi'' or ''Marcina'' (modern-day [[Salerno]]), ''Amina'' (modern-day [[Pontecagnano Faiano]]), ''Velcha'', ''Velsu'' and ''Uri''. In addition to [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] into their [[Urban sociology|urban-political]] domains, the Etruscans also incorporated the pre-existing tribal Oscan agro-towns of ''Capua'' (modern-day [[Santa Maria Capua Vetere]]), ''[[Nuceria]]'' (modern-day ''[[comune|comuni]]'' of [[Nocera Superiore]] and [[Nocera Inferiore]]), [[Suessula]], [[Acerra]], [[Ercolano]], [[Pompeii]], [[Stabiae]] and [[Sorrento]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://spazioinwind.libero.it/popoli_antichi/Etruschi/Etruria%20Campana.html| title = Etruria campana| access-date = 2 September 2019| archive-date = 14 December 2021| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211214214230/http://spazioinwind.libero.it/popoli_antichi/Etruschi/Etruria%20Campana.html| url-status = live}}</ref><ref>[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', V (Italia), 4.3.</ref><ref name = ":0">{{cite book|title=Storia di Nocera.

Meanwhile, during the 8th century BC, [[Ancient Greek language|Greek-speaking people]] from [[Euboea]] (in [[Central Greece (geographic region)|Central Greece]]), known as [[Cumae]]ans, began to establish colonies themselves roughly around the coastal areas of the modern-day [[province of Naples]] and in the [[Phlegraean Islands|nearby islands]] founding, among others, the cities of [[Cumae]], ''Pithekoūsai'' (modern-day [[Ischia]]), [[Paestum]], [[Herculaneum]] and ''Dicaearchia'', later 'Puteoli', in Latin (modern-day [[Pozzuoli]]). The city of [[Naples]] began as a small commercial port called [[History of Naples#Greek birth, Roman acquisition|Parthenope]] (Παρθενόπη, meaning "Pure Eyes", a Siren in [[Greek mythology]]), which was established by Greek colonial sailors from [[Rhodes]].<ref name="campaniahistoryone">{{cite news|url=http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505081832/http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archive-date=5 May 2005|publisher=Interteam.it|title=Campania: History|date=7 October 2007}}</ref> The region thus became one of the centers of [[Magna Graecia]].

At one point in history, a distinct group of Oscan-speaking tribes from [[Samnium]] (in south-central Italy), the [[Samnites]], moved down into Campania.
Since the Samnites were more warlike than the other Oscan populations, they easily took over the cities of [[Capua]] and Cumae, in an area which was one of the most prosperous and fertile in the [[Italian Peninsula]] at the time.<ref name = "samnite wars"/> During the 340s BC, the Samnites were engaged in a war with the [[Roman Republic]] in a dispute known as the [[Samnite Wars]], with Rome claiming the rich pastures of northern Campania during the [[Samnite Wars|First Samnite War]].<ref name = "pirat"/> The First Samnite War was initiated when the Etruscan-influenced Oscan city of Capua (in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Capeva'') was being attacked by the Samnites, and thus appealed to Rome for defensive help.

As the majority of [[Southern Italy]] was under Roman control at the time, the sole major remaining independent settlement in the region was the [[Greeks|Greek]] colony of [[Naples|Neapolis]], and when the city was eventually [[Capture of Neapolis|captured by the Samnites]], the Neapolitan Greeks were left with no option but to call on the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], with whom they established an alliance, setting off the [[Second Samnite War]].<ref name="samnite wars">{{cite news|url=http://www.unrv.com/empire/samnite-wars.php|publisher=UNRV.com|title=The Samnite Wars|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009|archive-date=28 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628093318/http://www.unrv.com/empire/samnite-wars.php|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Consul|Roman consul]] Quintus Publilius Filo recaptured Neapolis by 326 BC and allowed it to remain a Greek city with some autonomy as a ''[[civitas]] foederata'' while strongly aligned with Rome.<ref name="romannaples">{{cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Roman_Naples.html|publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.du|title=Roman Naples|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629003110/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Roman_Naples.html|archive-date=29 June 2009}}</ref> The Second Samnite War ended with the Romans controlling all of southern Campania and additional regions further to the south, such as parts of [[Lucania]].<ref name="pirat">{{cite news|url=http://pirate.shu.edu/~vigorimi/genealogy/first_millenium_BC.html|publisher=Michael Vigorita|title=Ancient Times – 1st millennium B.C.|date=7 October 2007|access-date=22 July 2009|archive-date=7 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007230938/http://pirate.shu.edu/~vigorimi/genealogy/first_millenium_BC.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Campania was a full-fledged part of the [[Roman Republic]] by the end of the 4th century BC, valued for its [[pasture]]s and rich countryside. Naples, with its [[Greek language]] and customs, made it a centre of Hellenistic culture for the Romans, creating the first traces of [[Greco-Roman]] culture.<ref name = "rome"/> During the [[Pyrrhic War]] in 275 BC, the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] took place in Campania in the Samnite city of Maleventum, in which the Romans, led by the consul [[Curius Dentatus]], were victorious.

The area had many [[Duchy|duchies]] and [[principalities]] during the [[Middle Ages]], in the hands of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire) and the [[Lombards]]. Under the [[Normans]], the smaller [[List of sovereign states|independent states]] were brought together as part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], before the mainland broke away to form the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. It was during this period that elements of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]] and [[Aragon]]ese culture were introduced to Campania. Allegiances with the Muslim [[Saracens]] were made in 836, and the Arabs were requested to repel the siege of [[Lombards|Lombard]] troops coming from the neighbouring [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=mag>{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990}}</ref><ref>Hilmar C.

==Geography==

Four other regions border Campania; [[Lazio]] to the northwest, [[Molise]] to the north, [[Apulia]] (Puglia) to the northeast and [[Basilicata]] to the east.

The mountainous interior is fragmented into several [[massif]]s, rarely reaching {{convert|2,000|m|0|abbr=on}} (Miletto of {{convert|2050|m|0|abbr=on}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trekkingfacile.it/da-campitello-matese-a-monte-miletto-2050m/|title=Da Campitello Matese a Monte Miletto|date=20 June 2020|access-date=16 March 2023|language=it|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918215730/https://www.trekkingfacile.it/da-campitello-matese-a-monte-miletto-2050m/|url-status=live}}</ref> whereas close to the coast there are volcanic massifs: [[Vesuvio]] ({{convert|1281|m|0|abbr=on}})<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.campania.info/vesuvio/|title=Vesuvio|access-date=16 March 2023|language=it|archive-date=29 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230129045225/https://www.campania.info/vesuvio/|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Campi Flegrei]].

The climate is typically [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] along the coast with warm, sunny and sultry summers and mild, rainy winters, whereas in the inner zones it is more continental, with lower temperatures in winter and warm summers. Snow is possible at higher elevations but rare at sea level. 51% of the total area is hilly, 34% mountainous and the remaining 15% is made up of plains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.schededigeografia.net/Italia/Regioni/Campania.htm|title=Campania|access-date=16 March 2023|language=it|archive-date=7 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230207202323/https://www.schededigeografia.net/Italia/Regioni/Campania.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> There is a high [[seismic risk]] across the region.

[[File:Forum in Pompeii 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]] of [[Pompeii]] with [[Vesuvius]] in the distance]]

Tourism is supported by the abundant presence of artistic and naturalistic beauty which attract millions of people from all over the world every year. Precisely in this sector the region finds its strong point (through which it was able to react to the recession in 2015), in fact, according to 2018 studies done by [[Eurostat]], Campania is in the top 20 of the most visited regions in Europe and fifth in Italy after [[Lombardy]], [[Lazio]], [[Veneto]] and [[Tuscany]] (in order), as well as first among the southern regions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dario Raffaele|url=http://www.qds.it/index.php?sez=articolo&skip_interstitial=true&id=6823|title=Turismo: Sicilia fuori dalla top 20 europea|access-date=10 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331190022/http://www.qds.it/index.php?id=6823&sez=articolo&skip_interstitial=true|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Decline of heavy industry ===
[[File:Napoli Bagnoli derelict steelworks (31011880362).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Bagnoli derelict steelworks (2016)]]
Campania is traditionally the most industrialized region of southern Italy, particularly the Neapolitan territory was one of the most industrialized areas of Italy until the beginning of the 20th century, preceded only by the provinces of the so-called "industrial triangle" ([[Milan]], [[Turin]] and [[Genoa]]).<ref>[http://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/pubsto/quastoeco/quadsto_04 aspetti provinciali della crescita industriale nell'Italia postunitaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009093210/http://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/pubsto/quastoeco/quadsto_04 |archive-date=9 October 2010}}</ref>

In recent decades, the gap with respect to other regions is no longer as significant as it used to be, given that southern regions such as [[Apulia]] and [[Abruzzo]] have grown considerably economically, while Campania has paradoxically undergone a constant process of de-industrialisation. The symbol of this phenomenon is the reclamation process of the area in [[Bagnoli]] where the former [[Italsider]] and [[Eternit]] operated promoted by the region.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bagnolifutura.it/ |title=Bagnolifutura|access-date=20 May 2011 |archive-date=7 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164104/http://www.bagnolifutura.it/}}</ref>

=== Food and agriculture ===

Over half of the population is resident in the province of Naples, where there is a population density of 2,626 inhabitants per km2. Within the province, the highest density can be found along the coast, where it reaches 13,000 inhabitants per km2 in the city of Portici. The region, which was characterised until recently by an acute economic contrast between internal and coastal areas, has shown an improvement in the last decade thanks to the development of the provinces of Benevento and Avellino. At the same time, the provinces of Naples, Caserta and in part Salerno, have developed a variety of activities connected to advanced types of services.<ref name="regportraits1">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf3_geo.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132137/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf3_geo.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref>

Unlike central and [[northern Italy]], in the first decade of the 2000s the region of Campania has not attracted large numbers of immigrants, despite having increased from approximately 100,000 in 2007 to 240,000 in 2021. The Italian national institute of statistics [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] estimated in December 2022 that 241,008 foreign-born immigrants live in Campania, equal to 4.32% of the total regional population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://demo.istat.it/app/?l=it&a=2022&i=P03 |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |access-date=5 May 2023 |archive-date=30 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230430095145/https://demo.istat.it/app/?l=it&a=2022&i=P03 |url-status=live }}</ref> Part of the reason for this is in recent times, there have been more employment opportunities in northern regions than in the [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] regions.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Campania}}
The [[Politics of Campania]], takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the President of Regional Government is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Regional Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.

The Regional Council of Campania (''Consiglio Regionale della Campania'') is composed of 60 members, of which 47 are elected in provincial constituencies with [[proportional representation]], 12 from the so-called "regional list" of the elected president and the last one is for the candidate for president who comes second, who usually becomes the leader of the opposition in the council. If a coalition wins more than 55% of the vote, only 6 candidates from the "regional list" will be elected and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 53.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PRI.1046.1&p_p_id=20&p_p_action=1&p_p_state=exclusive&p_p_col_id=null&p_p_col_pos=2&p_p_col_count=3&_20_struts_action=%2Fdocument_library%2Fget_file&_20_folderId=69&_20_name=l+cost+199_PDF.pdf |title=Home – Consiglio Regionale della Lombardia |publisher=Consiglio.regione.lombardia.it |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090306051303/http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PRI.1046.1&p_p_id=20&p_p_action=1&p_p_state=exclusive&p_p_col_id=null&p_p_col_pos=2&p_p_col_count=3&_20_struts_action=%2Fdocument_library%2Fget_file&_20_folderId=69&_20_name=l+cost+199_PDF.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Neapolitan cuisine}}
[[File:Eq it-na pizza-margherita sep2005 sml.jpg|thumb|right|An authentic [[Neapolitan pizza]]]]
Campanian cuisine varies within the region. While Neapolitan dishes centre on seafood, Casertan and Aversan ones rely more on fresh vegetables and cheeses. The cuisine from Sorrento combines the culinary traditions from both Naples and Salerno. [[Pizza]] was conceived in Naples.<ref name=Helstosky21>{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|url=https://archive.org/details/pizzaglobalhisto00hels|url-access=limited|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-391-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pizzaglobalhisto00hels/page/n22 21]–22}}</ref> [[Spaghetti]] is also a well-known dish from southern Italy and Campania. 
[[File:Pasta Puttanesca by koishikawagirl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Spaghetti alla puttanesca]], a spicy pasta dish topped with a sauce made of tomatoes, olives, [[anchovies]] and [[capers]]]]

Campania produces wines including [[Lacryma Christi]], [[Fiano (grape)|Fiano]], [[Aglianico]], [[Greco di Tufo]], [[Falerno del Massico]], [[Taburno]], [[Solopaca]], and [[Taurasi DOCG|Taurasi]]. The cheeses of Campania consist of [[Buffalo mozzarella|Mozzarella di Bufala (buffalo mozzarella)]] (mozzarella made from buffalo milk), fiordilatte ("flower of milk") a mozzarella made from cow's [[milk]], [[ricotta]] from [[sheep]] or [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]] milk, [[provolone]] from cow milk, and [[caciotta]] made from goat milk. [[Domestic buffalo|Buffalo]] are bred in the provinces of [[Salerno]] and [[Caserta]].

Several different cakes and pies are made in Campania. [[Pastiera]] pie is made during [[Easter]]. [[Casatiello]] and [[tortano]] are [[Easter bread]]s made by adding lard or oil and various types of cheese to bread dough and garnishing it with slices of [[salami]]. [[Rum baba|Babà]] cake is a well known Neapolitan delicacy, best served with [[rum]] or [[limoncello]] (a liqueur invented in the [[Sorrentine Peninsula|Sorrento peninsula]]). It is an old [[Austria]]n cake, which arrived in Campania during the Austrian domination of the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]] and was modified there to become a "walking cake" for citizens always in a hurry for work and other pursuits. [[Sfogliatella]] is another pastry from the [[Amalfi Coast]], as is [[Zeppole]], traditionally eaten on [[Saint Joseph]]'s day. [[Struffoli]], little balls [[fried dough]] dipped in [[honey]], are enjoyed during the Christmas holidays.

[[File:Amalfi - limoni e peperoncini - "lemons and red dried peppers".jpg|thumb|Dried red peppers and lemons hanging from a shop in [[Amalfi]]]]
Another Campanian dish is the so-called [[Russian salad]], also known as Olivier salad, which is based on similar dishes from [[France]]. It is made of potatoes in [[mayonnaise]] garnished with [[shrimp]] and vegetables in vinegar. Another French-derived dish is "gattò" or "gâteau di patate" (an oven-baked pie made of boiled potatoes). As with the Russian salad, Campania is home to popular seafood-based dishes, such as "insalata di mare" ([[seafood salad]]), "zuppa di polpo" ([[octopus soup]]), and "zuppa di cozze" (mussel soup). Other regional seafood dishes include "frittelle di mare" (fritters with seaweed), made with edible [[poseidonia]] algae, "triglie al cartoccio" (red mullet in the bag), and "alici marinate" (fresh anchovies in olive oil). The island of Ischia is known for its fish dishes, as well as for cooked rabbit. Campania is also home to the lemons of [[Sorrento]]. [[Rapini]] (or Broccoli rabe), known locally as ''friarielli'', are often used in regional cooking. Campania also produces many nuts, especially in the area of Avellino, Salerno and Benevento. [[Hazelnut]] production is especially relevant in the province of Avellino – in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and in [[Occitan language|Occitan]] the hazelnut is respectively called ''avellana'', ''avelã'' and ''avelano'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ansa.it/viaggiart/it/city-411-avella.html|title=Avella|access-date=16 March 2023|language=it|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918215724/https://www.ansa.it/viaggiart/it/city-411-avella.html|url-status=live}}</ref> after the city of [[Avella]]. That is also the case of ancient Italian ''avellana'', which is however not in use anymore.

===Ancient, medieval, and early arts===
[[File:Reggia Caserta parco 03-09-08 f01.jpg|thumb|The grand gardens of the baroque [[Royal Palace of Caserta]]]]

The region of Campania is rich with a vast array of culture and history. Since the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] of [[Velia (town)|Elea]], now [[Velia]], Campania was home to philosophers of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]] school, such as [[Parmenides]] and [[Zeno of Elea]], who came to prominence around 490–480 BC. The [[Latin language|Latin]] poet [[Vergil]] (70 BC–19 BC) settled in Naples in his late-life: parts of his [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] [[Aeneid]] are located in Campania. The ancient scientist [[Pliny the Elder]] studied Mount Vesuvius and died after being poisoned and killed by gas emitted from the volcano during the 79 AD eruption.

[[Romulus Augustus]], the last emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], died as a prisoner of the German general [[Odoacer]] at Naples around 500. In the [[Middle Ages]], the artist [[Giotto]] made some frescoes in [[Castel Nuovo]]. These works of art were subsequently destroyed by an earthquake.

By the end of the Middle Ages, the [[medical school]] of [[Salerno]], which combined ancient Roman and [[Medicine in ancient Greece|Greek medicine]] with Arab medicine, was known throughout Europe and its methods were adopted across the continent. Some have suggested that this may have been one of the first universities in Europe. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], the Tuscan poet, visited Naples on various occasions, and in the [[The Decameron|Decameron]] described it as a dissolute city. He also wrote a love story involving a noblewoman close to the King of Naples.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PulcinellaGuitar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pulcinella]] with a guitar]] -->
In 1570, the Spanish writer [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who wrote the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'', served as a Spanish soldier for a period in Naples. Poet [[Torquato Tasso]] was born in Sorrento in 1575. Years earlier in 1558, the first modern description and studies of the "camera obscura" ("[[dark chamber]]"), were established in Italy by [[Giovanni Battista della Porta]] in his '' [[Magiae Naturalis]]''.

Philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] was born in [[Nola]]. He was the first to theorize infinite suns and infinite worlds in the universe. He was burnt in [[Rome]] by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1600. Later, in {{Circa|1606}}, the Baroque painter [[Caravaggio]] established his studio in Naples. Italian Baroque architect [[Cosimo Fanzago]] from [[Bergamo]] also decided to move to Naples.

In the 18th century, Naples was the last city to be visited by philosophers who created the "Grand Tour" which was the big touring voyage to visit all the important cultural sites of the European continent. Italian architect [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] son of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] architect [[Caspar van Wittel]] built the [[Royal Palace of Caserta|Royal Palace]] in [[Caserta]] in {{circa|1750}}. He contributed to the construction of many [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassic-style]] palaces in which the nobles of Naples spent their holidays. These palaces are now known worldwide as "[[Ville Vesuviane]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=Ville Vesuviane |url=https://www.worldheritagesite.org/tentative/former/Ville+Vesuviane |publisher=World Heritage Site |access-date=6 June 2021 |archive-date=22 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240422235942/https://www.worldheritagesite.org/tentative/former/Ville+Vesuviane |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Overlooking Capri harbour from the rotunda in Villa San Michele Anacapri 2013.jpg|thumb|The island of [[Capri]], often seen as a cultural symbol of Campania]]

[[Raimondo di Sangro]], prince of Sansevero, was a scientist and one of the last alchemists. Around this time, in 1786, German writer [[Goethe]] visited Campania and Naples. German archaeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] also visited Naples, Paestum, Herculaneum and Pompeii in 1748 and later, studying how archaeological surveys were conducted in the kingdom of Naples. He was one of the first to study drawings, statues, stones, and ancient burned scrolls made of papyrus found in the excavations of the city of Herculaneum. Archaeological excavations in Pompeii were initiated by King Charles III of Naples in 1748. He issued the first modern laws in Europe to protect, defend and preserve archaeological sites. Neapolitan musicians of that period include [[Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello]].

Musician [[Gioachino Rossini]] lived for several years in Naples, where he wrote numerous compositions. [[List of Italian language poets|Italian poet]] and writer [[Giacomo Leopardi]] established his home in Naples and [[Torre del Greco]], remaining there at the end of his brief young life. He died at Naples in 1837. The first [[volcano observatory]], the [[Vesuvius Observatory]], was founded in Naples in 1841. Geologist [[Giuseppe Mercalli]], born in [[Milan]] in 1850, was a director of the Vesuvius Observatory.

In February 1851, British statesman [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was allowed to visit the prison where Giacomo Lacaita, legal adviser to the British embassy, was imprisoned by the Neapolitan government, along with other political dissidents.<ref>H. C. G. Matthew, ''Gladstone. 1809–1874'' (Oxford University Press, 1988), p. 80-81.</ref> He deplored their condition, and in April and July, he published two ''Letters to the Earl of Aberdeen'' against the Neapolitan government, followed by ''An Examination of the Official Reply of the Neapolitan Government'' in 1852.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZAOAAAAQAAJ|title=Two Letters to the Earl of Aberdeen: On the State Prosecutions of the Neapolitan Government|first=William Ewart|last=Gladstone|date=15 June 1859|publisher=J.

French writer [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] was directly involved in the process of the Unification of Italy and sojourned two or three years in Naples, where he wrote several [[historical novel]]s regarding that city. He was also a known newspaper correspondent. [[Francesco de Sanctis (critic)|Francesco de Sanctis]], writer, politician and twice Minister of Instruction after the reunification of Italy in 1861, was born in [[Morra De Sanctis]] near Avellino.

German scientist [[Anton Dohrn]] founded in Naples the first public aquarium in the world and laboratory for the study of the sea, known as Maritime Zoological Station. The Astronomic Observatory of Capodimonte was founded by King [[Joachim Murat]], in 1816. The observatory now hosts the Italian Laboratory of Astrophysics. Doctors and surgeons [[Antonio Cardarelli]] and [[Giuseppe Moscati]] were representatives of medical studies in Naples.

===Contemporary and modern arts===
The so-called "[[School of Posillipo]]" and "[[School of Resina]]", dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, included painters, such as [[Giacinto Gigante]], [[Federico Cortese]], [[Domenico Morelli]], [[Saverio Altamura]], [[Giuseppe De Nittis]], [[Vincenzo Gemito]], [[Antonio Mancini]], and [[Raffaello Pagliaccetti]].

Amongst the painters who inspired directly these schools, are [[Salvator Rosa]], [[Pierre-Jacques Volaire]], and [[Antonie Sminck Pitloo|Anton Sminck van Pitloo]], who spent his last years in Naples. Opera singer [[Enrico Caruso]] was also a native of Naples. Russian revolutionary leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] lived for a period in [[Capri]]. In the 20th century, the music genre called [[Neapolitan song]] became popular worldwide, with songs such as "[['O sole mio]]", "[[Funiculì, Funiculà]]", "[['O surdato 'nnammurato]]", "[[Torna a Surriento]]", "[[Santa Lucia (song)|Santa Lucia]]", "[[Malafemmena]]", "[['A vucchella]]", and "[[Passione (song)|Passione]]".

Mathematician [[Renato Caccioppoli]], nephew of the Russian anarchic revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]], was born in [[Naples]]. The first [[President of the Italian Republic]] in 1946 (with a pro-tempore mandate of six months) was [[Enrico De Nicola]] from Torre del Greco. Campania is also home to the former [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] and 6th President of the Republic [[Giovanni Leone]], as well as the 11th President, [[Giorgio Napolitano]].

[[File:Caserta-reggia-15-4-05 063.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Late Baroque art inside the [[Royal Palace of Caserta|Palace of Caserta]]]]
The 20th century's best known philosopher and literate in Naples was [[Benedetto Croce]], known for his studies in [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[logic]], [[economy]], [[history]], [[politics]].

Neapolitan artists, actors, playwrights, and showmen included [[Eduardo De Filippo]] and [[Peppino De Filippo]], and their sister [[Titina De Filippo]]. [[Totò]] (byname of Antonio de Curtis) was one of the most important comedians in Naples in the 20th century. He is also known for the song "Malafemmena".

Pop artist [[Andy Warhol]] created two famous paintings of the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]]: ''[[Fate presto]]'' and ''[[Vesuvius 365]]''. Both originals are hosted in the exhibit [[Terrae Motus]] in the Palace of Caserta.

[[Academy Award|Oscar]]–winning actress [[Sophia Loren]] grew up in [[Pozzuoli]].
