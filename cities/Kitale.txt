The [[Kitale Museum|National Museum of Western Kenya]] is located at Kitale. It is a [[natural history museum]] and was originally created by Lt Col. Hugh Stoneham in 1926.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museums.or.ke/content/blogcategory/19/25/ |title=About Kenyan Museums |publisher=Kenyan Museums |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111021342/http://www.museums.or.ke/content/blogcategory/19/25/ |archive-date=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |access-date=2008-01-05 }}</ref> Just next to the museum there is a demonstration farm with agroforestry practices run by a Swedish non-governmental organisation called Vi Agroforestry.

==Location==
Kitale lies between [[Mount Elgon]] and [[Cherang'any Hills]] is 72.3&nbsp;km (44.9&nbsp;mi) by road north west of [[Eldoret]].

==History==
Establishment and settlement in the present town of Kitale was begun by the colonial district commissioner Arthur Champion and Arthur Cecil Hoey OBE, a farmer who built the Hoey's Bridge (later renamed Moi's Bridge) in order to enable access across the River Nzoia. In 1920 Mr. Champion, who was still administering the District from a site near Hoey’s Bridge, later known as the “Old Boma”, asked Mr. and Mrs. Hoey to help him choose his new headquarters in the Trans Nzoia, and thus the future township of Kitale was brought to life, it is having hitherto been merely a square on the map.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=E.A.W.L |first=Trans Nzoia Branch |date=1969 |title=Mr. and Mrs. A.C. Hoey |journal=Trans–Nzoia Scrap Book 1969}}</ref> The close of the 19th century saw the majority of East Africa come under British protection and this led to the establishment of national and sub-national boundaries. The greater Trans Nzoia area initially included the Uganda portion of what was known as the [[East Africa Protectorate|British East African Protectorate]] though this was annexed to become a part of Kenya during administrative restructuring in 1902. At this time the urban area was non-existent and the undulating grasslands formed part of Maasai grazing fields.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://paukwa.or.ke/kitale-town-kenya/ |title=Kitale Town, Kenya |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 May 2020 |website=paukwa.or.ke |publisher=Paukwa |access-date=21 April 2023 |quote=}}</ref>

Christine Nichols (2014) notes that a 1908 map of the Trans Nzoia area showed numerous potential farms delineated by metal beacons stuck in the ground. A survey had been done to encourage white settlers to come to the area and Kitale appeared as a rectangle three miles by two, but in reality there was nothing there – not even one building.

In 1919, the British Government sent out settlers after the First World War and they found that what was supposed to be Kitale was just grassland and scattered trees, there was still not a single hut or person to be seen. One traveler noted: ‘It was impossible to foresee that this small area was destined to become the commercial center of the 1000 square miles of fertile land. As I moved westwards two huge lions passed me, for this was lion country where game abounded. Kongoni, reedbuck, oribi, topi and waterbuck were plentiful, and leopard well in evidence in the forested areas, their victims wild pig and monkeys.’<ref name="Nicholls">{{cite web |url=https://oldafricamagazine.com/the-founding-of-kitale/ |title=The Founding of Kitale |last=Nicholls |first=Christine |date=4 November 2014 |website=oldafricamagazine.com |publisher=Old Africa Magazine |access-date=21 April 2023 |quote=}}</ref>

In reality the [[Trans Nzoia District|Trans Nzoia district]] was not a popular area. It had a reputation as the home of malaria and blackwater fever and it was removed from civilisation, because the nearest rail-head was at Londiani over 100 miles away and the nearest bank was at [[Eldoret]], 45 miles (72 kilometers) away. But gradually convoys of ox wagons carrying furniture and tools traveled from Londiani and the soldier-settlers sent from England after the First World War began to occupy and develop the farms. A District Commissioner, Mr Champion, was appointed but as there were no buildings in Kitale he took up residence in what became known as the Old Boma not far from [[Moi's Bridge|Hoey’s Bridge]].

Firms began to build temporary premises near the water tank and the Standard Bank, Kitale Stores and Post Office, Howse & McGeorge, the Veterinary Office and Buck’s Hotel and Garage opened up. Permanent buildings were erected for the District Commissioner and the Police, and the Kitale Club was founded in 1924. At first there was no church and services were held in the houses of parishioners, led by the Rev. O.H. Knight, who had arrived in Eldoret in 1920. Saint Luke’s Church was built in Kitale in 1928, with the Rev. F. Tyrie as its incumbent, and the Roman Catholic church was constructed later, early in the Second World War. The hospital, with space for only four patients, was in a private house run by two nursing sisters. There was no permanent water or electricity, no permanent sanitation except pit latrines. Finally, a new hospital was opened in 1936. Water for household use was obtained by donkey transport from the stream below the Kitale Club where a small brick dam held back the water.<ref name="Nicholls"/>

Settlers pressed the government for a railway line but it was not until Sir Edward Grigg became governor that there was a change of policy and it was decided to extend the railway to Jinja in Uganda via Eldoret, and to construct a branch line from Eldoret to Kitale. The railway reach Kitale in 1925 and Governor Grigg visited the district for the opening of the line. He provided funds for building Kitale School which had hitherto occupied a cramped private residence and for a new African hospital.

The prosperity of Kitale depended on the farmers but during the agricultural depression of the 1930 and locust invasions, which caused extensive damage to crops, Kitale foundered. Recovery was slow but progress was made especially when there was a new influx of settlers after the Second World War. Then Kitale achieved full municipal status and a large measure of control over township affairs. The stage was set for it to develop into an important municipality.<ref name="Nicholls"/>

Kitale has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'').
