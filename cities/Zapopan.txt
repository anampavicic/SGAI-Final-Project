The name ''Zapopan'' means "among the [[sapote]] trees". It derives from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''tzapotl'' "sapote" with the addition of the locative suffix ''-pan''.<ref name="encmuc"/> It also has the nickname of “ex Villa Maicera” ("former Corn Village"), as it used to be a major producer of corn.<ref name="breve"/>  Its seal was designed by José Trinidad Laris in 1941 for the 400th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name="encmuc"/>

==History==
[[File:20 de noviembre de zapopan.jpg|alt=November 20th Way in Zapopan, Zapopan Square|thumb|November 20th Way in Zapopan Square]]
From 1160 to 1325 many [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]], [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] and [[Maya peoples|Maya]] families migrated into this area from the south, with many settling in the Profundo Arroyo area. These first settlers eventually mixed among themselves and with newcomers such as [[Aztec]]s and eventually were known as Tecos. Many small shrines called “cues” were built here, mostly to worship the sun, although the primary deity was a god-child called Teopiltzintli or the corn god.<ref name="encmuc"/>

By the time the Spanish arrived, Tzapopan was a fairly large settlement, but it was in decline due to wars with various surrounding nomadic tribes.  It was subject to the dominion of [[Atemajac de Brizuela|Atemajac]], also called Tlatoanazgo, which itself was subject to the Hueytlatoanazgo of Tonalá.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1530, this area was subdued by [[Nuño de Guzmán]], but the establishment of a Spanish settlement of Zapopan did not happen until 1541 due to the [[Mixtón War]]. In that year Francisco de Bobadilla, [[encomendero]] of Tlatltenango moved 130 Indians from his lands to repopulate Zapopan.  Accompanying them was an image of Our Lady of the Conception, which had traveled to areas like [[Zacatecas]] as part of evangelization efforts. This statue would eventually take on the name of Our Lady of Zapopan. The sanctuary for this image was begun in 1689.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1824, Zapopan was named as the seat of one of the 26 departments of the newly created state of Jalisco. When the departments were reorganized in 1837, it retained its status as seat. In 1873, General Ramon Corona fought against rebel forces led by Manuel Lozada “El Tigre de Alica” at Rancho de la Mojonera.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1979, Pope John Paul II visited the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]].<ref name="encmuc" />

In 1991, the town gained city status in a ceremony that took place on 8 December, the 450th anniversary of the city's foundation.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The flag of Zapopan is derived from a Nahuatl pictogram represented by the fruit tree of sapotes with a flag on its side.
The name Zapopan comes from the Nahuatl word ''tzapopan'', "place of sapotes".
 
Zapopan is the second most populous municipality in Jalisco and is the seventh most populous municipality in Mexico.
During the solemn session held on December 8, 1991, in which the 450th anniversary of the repopulation of the Villa Zapopan was celebrated, it was awarded the title of city.
 
The tourist attractions offered by Zapopan are diverse; from important religious points nationwide to world-class shopping malls. It also has different alternatives for ecological tourism such as El Diente, [[Bosque de La Primavera]], among others.
Within this municipality are located the best hotels in the Metropolitan Area, the largest show centers in Jalisco and museums that host exhibitions of local and international significance.
 
One of the most important religious celebrations at the national level, the pilgrimage of the Virgin of Zapopan. takes place in the same municipal seat. On October 12 thousands of Catholic faithful come to witness the return of "La Generala" to its compound, the Basilica of Zapopan.
The typical food is the same as in the other municipalities that make up the Metropolitan Area but it is worth highlighting the elaboration of
cymbals based on the corn, which is the tender corn cob. Zapopan is also known as the "Villa Exmaicera" due to the large amount of expanse planted of this agricultural product.

===Pre-Hispanic epoch===
The existence of a pre-Hispanic town called ''Tzapopan'' located in the current municipal seat is much disputed by various historians, since the locality was never mentioned in documents of the time, unlike other localities of the present day municipality and municipalities adjacent to it, such as: Ixcatán, Tesistán, San Esteban, Copala, Tónala, San Sebastián de Analco, Santa Ana Atista, Juanacatlán, Tala, San Gaspar, etc. This calls into question the existence of ''Tzapopan''.

However, for some experts; Zapopan's history began during the years 1160 to 1325, when many Zapotecs, Nahuas and Mayans, arrived in the present territory of Zapopan near the present Deep Creek, these groups came from the south in search of a settlement. The inhabitants, over the years, were mixed with other tribes, such as the Aztecs heading to the Valley of Mexico; however, it was the [tecuexes] who dominated the terrain over time. Tzapopan was founded by the Aztecs and tecuexes, from the beginning it was a very religious city that had worshippers and shrines to the sun god, but mainly the worship of this city was towards the god Teopiltzintli. The diet of the inhabitants was based on maize, beans and fruits, and they were dedicated to hunting and fishing.

Tzapopan was a city with a large population; Despite this, the constant wars with other nomadic tribes caused a decay of the city until it was turned into a very minor settlement, subjected to the lordship of Atemejac that depended on the Hueytlatonazgo of Tonalá, making it a people insignificant and of little importance to the arrival of the Spaniards.

===Conquest===
The conquest of the village of ''Tzapopan'' began around 1530, when [[Nuño de Guzmán]] conquered the Kingdom of Tonalá (to which "Tzapopan belonged"), although possibly by then the village was insignificant or even depopulated. Finally with the victory by the conquerors in the [[Miztón War]] in 1541 the region is conquered, and licensed by the then viceroy, Francisco de Bobadilla, encomendero of Tlaltenango, who drew from his entruste the Necessary Indians to repopulate Tzapopan, in order to have close people of his who would serve him and help the foundation of Guadalajara, the task of repopulation and refoundation was left to Friar Antonio de Segovia who, together with Friar Angel of Valencia, delivered on 8 December 1541 as patron l in the image of the Tzapopan Conception. This image accompanied Father Segovia for ten years on his coming and going with the eagerness to Christianize Zacatecas and other places. It was this image, according to some historians, that is credited with the successful repopulation and subsequent calm on the part of the Indians. The construction of the current basilica was initiated in 1690 by Juan de Santiago de León Garabito.

In the historiography about the origin of Zapopan appears a legendary and perhaps fictional character named Nicholas of Bobadilla, Lord Encomendero that some sources point out as he who, with Indians from the region of Xalostotitlán, arrived in Zapopan around 1541 or 1543, according to the source to be consulted. However, contrary to what would be expected of a documentalist legal culture such as Spanish, there is no reliable evidence that some character with that name has benefited from some Indian mercy; if it actually existed, the testimonies of his time in these lands were simply lost in the sea of the bureaucracy of Seville, Cadiz or Madrid.

On the other hand, in order for there to be a repopulation, there must have been an abandonment of that population first; but, as settled in the different chronicles, the peoples of the eastern side of the San Juan de Dios River did not insubordinate themselves, moreover, it is mentioned for example, that Indians of Atemajac participated in the site of the endeavors in the Mixtón, under the viceroy of Mendoza, that is, none of the towns mentioned by Mata Torres, was razed during the War, so they were not repopulated, in any case, they were assigned to an encomendero, according to the forms of dominance indicated by the Spanish crown.

The key to the foundation of Zapopan is linked to the image of the Virgin. The Spaniards, since the time of the conquest of Tenochtitlán, had ordered the images of their gods replaced by images of the Virgin in the worshippers of the indigenous people; as was the case in all the worshippers of the center of the country, of Michoacán and during the conquest of the north and northwest. Although legend recalls the Virgin of Zapopan as "peacemaker in the wars against the indigenous people, Zapopan, indigenous people, was the headquarters of its most celebrated shrine in the whole of the West".<ref>Moreno, H. (1995). Jalisco pearl on the sand. (Second ed.) Mexico: SEP</ref>

Friar Antonio de Segovia does not give the image to the Indians of Zapopan, it deposits it there because this is the place of worship that all the lords of these lands had in common, following the custom of spiritual conquest. If the delivery had been linked to valuations relating to the population, the image would have remained in another population of the region.

In conclusion, Zapopan was before the conquest a center of worship, continued to be so after that, as a center of veneration of a Christian image and it was subsequently that a population emerged, with Indians owned by Francisco de Bobadilla, encomendero of the region of Tlaltenango, not of Xalostotitlán, around 1570.

This Francisco de Bobadilla is a descendant of Pedro de Bobadilla, who belonged to the hosts of Nuño de Guzmán during the conquest; Peter Gerard has conducted the most comprehensive study on the institution of the encomienda in the seventeenth century in Mexico and identifies a Pedro de Bobadilla as encomendero of the Tlaltenango region based in Tepechitlán around 1608.

===Nineteenth century: after independence===
[[File:Basílica de Zapopan.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Basílica de Zapopan.|Basílica de Zapopan]]
After the brief and failed imperial attempt with which the newly independent viceroyalty of New Spain had attempted to organize, on 21 June 1823 the territory of the former Province of Guadalajara was proclaimed as the Free State of Jalisco, the first of those who would make up the Federal Republic. The nascent state of Jalisco changed the scheme of Parties with which the territory of its jurisdiction - which had been used since the Bourbon reforms - was divided into the models of Departments, which in turn were subject to another larger unit: the Canton. Each Canton had a headline with a political chief who depended, in turn, on the Governor of the State. It concentrated political, military and fiscal decision-making.
In the first model of territorial organization of the State of Jalisco, of March 27, 1824, named as the Political Division Plan of the Territory of the State of Jalisco, Zapopan is a State Department and the town of Zapopan was proclaimed head of Apartment and named Villa. On November 18 of the same year, once the Political Constitution of the Free and Sovereign State of Jalisco was promulgated, Zapopan was ratified as a Department and attached to the first Canton of the State, with the head office in Guadalajara.
The Villa de Zapopan was located (and located) to the northwest of the city of Guadalajara, communicated with it by two paths: the first of them ran to the south-east of Zapopan, crossed the colomo{{Verify spelling|date=June 2022}} stream and entered the west part of Guadalajara; the second exited to the east of Zapopan, passing through Zoquipan and Atemajac and then entering through the northern part of Guadalajara through the neighborhood of Mezquitán.

In 1857, with the liberal republicans in power, Jalisco is a state and Zapopan a Department attached to the first Canton of Jalisco and the main populations besides Zapopan were: Tesistan, which is located {{cvt|10|km}} north-west of the head; Santa Ana Tepetitlán, located {{cvt|15|km}} south of the headwaters; Atemajac {{cvt|5|km}} east of the Villa; San Cristobal, {{cvt|40|km}} northwest. Other locations were [San Juan de Ocotán], {{cvt|5|km}} to the southwest; Jocotán, {{cvt|5|km}} south; Nextipac, {{cvt|12|km}} to the west; Zoquipan, {{cvt|2|km}} to the east; Sale of the Shipyard, {{cvt|17|km}} southwest; and San Esteban and Huaxtla located {{cvt|10|km}} northeast above the Oblate Canyon.

On April 6, 1837, he changed the model of territorial organization and Zapopan became a Guadalajara District Party. In 1846 another reorganization converted Zapopan back into an apartment of the first Canton of Jalisco whose head was Guadalajara. The model, with some minimal variations, is maintained until 1914 when the category of Municipality becomes the basis of the territorial division of the Republic. On April 6, 1917, the Political Constitution of the State of Jalisco recognized Zapopan as a Free Municipality.

The category of municipal headland remained unchanged until December 7, 1994, when, by decree 14358 the Congress of the State of Jalisco, changed the category of Villa that had since the beginning of the nineteenth century to that of Ciudad.

[[File:Basílica de Nuestra Señora de Zapopan (Jalisco, Mexico) - statue, Sacred Heart of Jesus.jpg|alt=statue, Sacred Heart of Jesus.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sacred Heart of Jesus]]
The Virgin of Zapopan is an image of Our Lady of the Conception which was made in Michoacán by native artisans in the early 16th century.<ref name="breve"/>  The statue is {{cvt|34|cm}} tall and made with corn stalks (''caña de maiz''), except for her hands which are made of wood. It was donated for evangelization efforts by Antonio de Segova, and carried to Zapopan by Miguel de Bolonia, who had the image tied to his body. Legend credits it with bringing an end to the Mixtón War in the 16th century as well as relief from epidemics that plagued Guadalajara in the 17th century, a “miracle” that was affirmed by the bishop of the area. It was named the “General” (La Generela) of the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] in 1821, with the military title ratified in 1852 and 1894 by elements of the federal and state governments.  It is still called by this alternate name. In 1919, it was crowned Queen of Jalisco by the Pope Benedict XV.<ref name="breve"/><ref name="senorades">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1849-Nuestra-Se%F1ora-de-Zapopan,-Jalisco |title= Nuestra Señora de Zapopan, Jalisco |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=Our Lady of Zapopan, Jalisco |access-date=January 19, 2010 }}</ref>

===Zapopum===
The Zapopum Festival started out as the municipal fair of Zapopan in 2005. Since, it has morphed into a major cultural event. It aims to be “a cultural reference point, whose purpose is to spread culture and bring it to the public who is accustomed to other types of shows.”  The 2009 event featured acrobats and circus acts from Spain, England, Germany and Italy. Some of these were “Alicia en los cielos” y the Spanish group Puja!, “Cupidos” and “Esferas” by Australian group Strange Fruit and performances by French mime Jerôme Murat. There are also workshops, themed pavilions and shows by popular Mexican artists such as [[Marco Antonio Muñiz]], [[Gloria Trevi]] and [[Ricardo Montaner]].
