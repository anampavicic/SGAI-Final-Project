==Etymology==
[[File:Kusadasisign cropped.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Sign on Kuşadası]]
[[File:Kuşadası_Coast_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Güvercinada]] ("Pigeon Island") derives its name in a similar fashion to ''Kuşadası'' ("Bird Island").]]

The name ''Kuşadası'' comes from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words ''kuş'' (bird) and ''ada'' (island), as [[Güvercin Island|the island]] has the shape of a bird's head (when seen from the sea).<ref name="kguidecom">{{Cite web| url=http://www.aboutkusadasi.com/kusadasi-guide/| title=Kusadasi Guide}}</ref> It was known as ''Ephesus Neopolis'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|el|Ἔφεσος Νεόπολις}}) during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era, and later as ''Scala Nova'' or ''Scala Nuova'' under the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]].<ref>[http://www.artofilo.info/filecat/filecat_downloader.php?id=0008 artofilo.info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515204813/http://www.artofilo.info/filecat/filecat_downloader.php?id=0008 |date=2011-05-15 }}</ref> ''Kuş Adası'' was adopted in its place during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the citizens of Kuşadası often shorten the town's name to ''Ada''.

==History==
===Antiquity===
The area has been a centre of art and culture since some of the earliest recorded history, and has been settled by many civilizations since being founded by the [[Leleges]] people in 3000 BC. Later settlers include the [[Aeolians]] in the 11th century BC and [[Ionians]] in the 9th. Originally, seamen and traders built a number of settlements along the coastline, including Neopolis.

An outpost of [[Ephesus]] in ancient [[Ionia]], known as [[Pygela]] (Πύγελα) was located in the area between the [[Büyük Menderes]] (Maeander) and [[Gediz River|Gediz]] (Hermos) rivers. The original Neopolis, is thought to have been founded on the nearby point of Yılancı Burnu. Later settlements were probably built on the hillside of Pilavtepe, in the district called Andızkulesi today. Kuşadası was a minor port frequented by vessels trading along the Aegean coast. In antiquity it was overshadowed by [[Ephesus]], until Ephesus' harbor silted up. From the 7th century BC onwards the coast was ruled by [[Lydians]] from their capital at [[Sardis]], then from 546 BC the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], and from 334 BC, along with all of Anatolia, the coast was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. From that point on the coastal cities in [[Anatolia]] became a centre of [[Hellenistic]] culture.

===Rome and Christianity===
The [[Roman Empire]] took possession of the coast in the 2nd century BC and made it their provincial capital<ref>[http://www.aboutkusadasi.com/ephesus/st-john.html St. John - History]</ref> in the early years of [[Christianity]].  [[Saint John the Evangelist]] and (according to Roman Catholic<!--and probably Islam, but NOT Orthodox Christians--> [[sacred tradition]]) the [[Virgin Mary]] both came to live in the area, which in the Christian era became known as "Ania".

As [[Byzantine]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] shippers began to trade along the coast, the port was re-founded (by the name of ''Scala Nova'' or ''Scala Nuova'', meaning "New Port"), a garrison was placed on the island, and the town centre shifted from the hillside to the coast.

The city had a [[Judaism|Jewish]] population as early as 1307, when a number of Jews were expelled from Scala Nova to [[Smyrna]].<ref name="je">{{cite web |last1=Deutsch |first1=Gotthard |last2=Galante |first2=Abraham |title=SCALA NOVA - JewishEncyclopedia.com |url=https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13243-scala-nova |website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com |publisher=[[The Jewish Encyclopedia]] |access-date=1 October 2024}}</ref> Following the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain]], 250 Jewish families went to Scala Nova. Plague and cholera epidemics in the 18th and 19th centuries drastically reduced the population to around 65 families by 1865.<ref name="je"/> In 1905, the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] indicated that there were 33 families living in the city, some of them immigrants from [[Morea expedition|Morea]] following the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]].
<ref name="je" />

===The Turkish era===
[[File:Kusadasi - Atatürk-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] Memorial in Kuşadası]]
Long afterwards, in 1834, the castle and garrison on the island were rebuilt and expanded, becoming the focus of the town. This was to such an extent that people began to refer to the whole town as Kuşadası (bird island).  However, in the 19th century, trade began to decline in favor of other nearby cities with the opening of the [[İzmir]]-[[Selçuk]]-[[Aydın]] railway, which bypassed Kuşadası.<ref>[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref><!---this has the advantage of being in English, but strictly speaking not an allowable reference. It is derivative, as is Wikipedia.----> From 1867 until 1922, Kuşadası was part of [[Aidin Vilayet]].

During the [[Turkish War of Independence]], Kuşadası was occupied from 1919-1922, first by Italian troops between 14 May 1919 and 24 May 1922, and then by Greek troops. The Turkish forces led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] eventually gained control of the city on September 7, 1922.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.haberkapisi.com/haber/kusadasinda-kurtulus-coskusu-205348.htm| title=Kuşadası'nda Kurtuluş Coşkusu| language=tr| publisher=Haberkapısı| date=7 September 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181319/http://www.haberkapisi.com/haber/kusadasinda-kurtulus-coskusu-205348.htm| archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>

After the establishment of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]], the Greek population was exchanged for Turks as part of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/books/review/Cooper.t.html?_r=0|title=Twice a Stranger: The Mass Expulsions That Forged Modern Greece and Turkey}}</ref> The Greeks founded new settlements such as [[Nea Efesos]] in [[Greece]]. Kusadasi remained a district in [[İzmir Province]] until its transfer to [[Aydın Province]] in 1957.

==Geography==
The&nbsp;city&nbsp;is situated along a [[Gulf of Kuşadası|gulf of the same name]] in the Aegean. The island of [[Güvercinada]] (in English: ''Pigeon Island'') is connected to mainland Kuşadası by a [[causeway]], and is situated adjacent to the large hill of Kese Dağı near the [[town centre|center of town]].

It is located {{convert|95|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[İzmir]], the area's metropolitan centre, and approximately {{convert|60-70|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in driving distance from the provincial seat of [[Aydın]], depending on the route taken. Its neighbours are [[Selçuk]] to the north, [[Germencik]] to the north-east, and [[Söke]] to the east and south.

==Demographics==
The district of Kuşadası had a total resident population of 130,835 in 2022, though the actual population is thought to rise to well over half a million in the summer months due to a significant influx of both domestic and international [[tourists]] as well as those visiting family or returning to their summer residence. This also includes the hotel and bar staff, construction workers, and drivers who are required to work in/for the restaurants and other services accommodating these visitors. In addition to tourists from overseas, there is also a substantial community of foreigners that have permanently settled in the area.

Kuşadası caters to tourists arriving by land, or from the port for [[cruise ship]] passengers heading to [[Ephesus]].  In a controversial deal in 2003{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}, the previously public-owned port was leased to a private company and renovated to attract luxury cruise liners.

The area features several well-known local beaches, including [[Ladies Beach, Kuşadası|Ladies Beach]], the beach at the centrum, the beaches between the Batıhan Hotel and the Nazilli Site, the beach at [[Güzelçamlı]], and the [[Dilek Peninsula-Büyük Menderes Delta National Park]] beach, referred to by locals as simply ''Milli Park''.<ref name="kguidecom"/>
