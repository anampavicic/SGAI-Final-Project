== History ==
In 1524, the Spanish conquered and colonized the territory of Cuscatlán, now El Salvador. Indigenous allies and aborigines ([[Tlaxcaltecas]], [[Aztecs]], and Acolhuas) from the valley of [[Valley of Mexico|Anahuac]], a Mexican territory, arrived with them. After conquering the land, they settled north of the capital, were known as "Mexicans” and founded three core groups: one group was to the north, which is now [[San Salvador]], where the City of Mejicanos is located; the second was in Barrio de Sonsonate; and the third was Usulután, today Canton Santa Maria.

The city’s first named was "Villa of Mejicanos", and it later became the "City of Mejicanos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alcaldiamunicipalmejicanos.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/mejicanos-su-historia-2/|title=alcaldiamunicipal|website=alcaldiamunicipal|date=7 July 2011 |language=es-ES|access-date=2016-04-28}}</ref> On 7 February 1823, General [[Vicente Filísola]] following orders of the Mexican Imperial Army, [[Battle of the Mejicanos (1823)|battled]] against Salvadoran Republic Army of Colonel [[Antonio José Cañas]], substitute for Commander [[Manuel José Arce]], who became ill.
