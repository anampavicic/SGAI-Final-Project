The area of modern Tripura — ruled for several centuries by the [[Manikya Dynasty]] — was part of the [[Tripuri Kingdom]] (also known as Hill Tippera). It became a [[princely state]] under the [[British Raj]] during its tenure, and acceded to independent India in 1947. It merged with India in 1949 and was designated as a 'Part C State' ([[union territory]]).<ref name="Sajal Nag">{{citation |editor1=Sajal Nag |editor2=Tejimal Gurung |editor3=Abhijit Choudhury |title=Making of the Indian Union: Merger of princely states and excluded areas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3UMAQAAMAAJ |year=2007 |publisher=Akansha Pub.

Tripura lies in a geographically isolated location in India, as only one major highway, [[National Highway 8 (India)|National Highway 8]], connects it with the rest of the country. Five mountain ranges — [[Baramura]], [[Atharamura]], [[Longtharai]], [[Shakhan]] and [[Jampui Hills]] — run north to south, with intervening valleys; [[Agartala]], the capital, is located on a plain to the west. The state has a [[tropical savanna climate]], and receives seasonal heavy rains from the [[southwest monsoon|south west monsoon]].

Forests cover more than half of the area, in which [[bamboo]] and [[cane (grass)|cane]] tracts are common. Tripura has the highest number of [[primate]] species found in any Indian state. Due to its geographical isolation, economic progress in the state is hindered. Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura, which has a limited infrastructure. Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities, although the service sector is the largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product.

According to the 2011 census, Tripura is one of the most literate states in India, with a literacy rate of 87.75%. Mainstream Indian cultural elements coexist with traditional practices of the ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities. The sculptures at the archaeological sites [[Unakoti]], [[Pilak, Tripura|Pilak]] and [[Devtamura]] provide historical evidence of artistic fusion between organised and indigenous religions.

==Etymology==
[[File:Tripura Sundari Temple, Udaipur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tripura Sundari Temple]] in [[Udaipur, Tripura|Udaipur]].]]
The name Tripura is linked to the Hindu goddess [[Tripura Sundari]], the presiding deity of the [[Tripura Sundari Temple]] at [[Udaipur, Tripura|Udaipur]], one of the 51 ''[[Shakti Peethas]]'' (pilgrimage centres of ''[[Shaktism]]''),<ref name="hr name"/><ref name="Debbarma1996"/> and to the legendary tyrant king Tripur, who reigned in the region. Tripur was the 39th descendant of [[Druhyu]], who belonged to the lineage of [[Yayati]], a king of the [[Lunar Dynasty]].<ref name="Acharjya1979">{{cite book|last=Acharjya|first=Phanibhushan|title=Tripura|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.489119|year=1979|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|page=1|asin=B0006E4EQ6}}</ref>

There are alternative theories regarding the origin of the name Tripura, such as a possible [[folk etymology|etymological reinterpretation]] to [[Sanskrit]] of a Tibeto-Burman ([[Kokborok]]) name. Variants of the name include ''Tipra'', ''Tuipura'' and ''Tippera'', which can all denote the  indigenous people inhabiting the area.<ref name="hr name"/> A Kokborok etymology from  ''tüi'' (water) and ''pra'' (near) has been suggested; the boundaries of Tripura extended to the [[Bay of Bengal]] when the kings of the Tipra Kingdom held sway from the [[Garo Hills]] of [[Meghalaya]] to [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], the present Rakhine State of [[Burma]]; so the name may reflect vicinity to the sea.<ref name="hr name">{{cite book|title=Human rights and indigenous peoples|last=Das|first=J.K.|pages=208–9|publisher=APH Publishing|year=2001|isbn=978-81-7648-243-1|chapter=Chapter 5: old and new political process in realization of the rights of indigenous peoples (regarded as Tribals) in Tripura}}</ref><ref name="Debbarma1996">{{cite book|last=Debbarma|first=Sukhendu|title=Origin and growth of Christianity in Tripura: with special reference to the New Zealand Baptist Missionary Society, 1938–1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyfrzVvJNxUC&pg=PA20|year=1996|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-038-5|page=20|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429233857/https://books.google.com/books?id=vyfrzVvJNxUC&pg=PA20|archive-date=29 April 2016}}</ref><ref>Prakash (ed.), ''Encyclopaedia of North-east India'', vol. 5, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ixSANFgMjW0C&pg=PA2272 p. 2272] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424123659/https://books.google.com/books?id=ixSANFgMjW0C&pg=PA2272 |date=24 April 2016 }}</ref>

===Topography===
The physiography is characterised by hill ranges, valleys and plains. The state has five [[anticline|anticlinal]] ranges of hills running north to south, from [[Baramura]] in the west, through [[Atharamura]], [[Longtharai]] and [[Shakhan]], to the [[Jampui Hills]] in the east.<ref name="gsi report">{{Cite report| title= Geology and mineral resources of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura| url= http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/gsiImages/information/miscpub30-4-2_man-mizo-naga-tripura.pdf| publisher= Geological Survey of India, Government of India| series= Miscellaneous publication No. 30 Part IV| volume= 1| year= 2011| issue= 2| access-date= 10 July 2012| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510091749/http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/gsiImages/information/miscpub30-4-2_man-mizo-naga-tripura.pdf| archive-date= 10 May 2013}}</ref>{{rp|4}} The intervening [[syncline]]s are the Agartala–Udaipur, Khowai–Teliamura, Kamalpur–Ambasa, Kailasahar–Manu and Dharmanagar–Kanchanpur valleys.<ref name="gsi report"/>{{rp|4}} At an altitude of {{convert|939|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Betlingchhip|Betling Shib]] in the Jampui range is the state's highest point.<ref name="hdrchap1"/>{{rp|4}}  The small isolated hillocks interspersed throughout the state are known as ''tillas'', and the narrow fertile alluvial valleys, mostly present in the west, are called ''Doóng/lungas''.<ref name="hdrchap1"/>{{rp|4}} A number of rivers originate in the hills of Tripura and flow into Bangladesh.<ref name="hdrchap1"/>{{rp|4}}  The Khowai, [[Dhalai River|Dhalai]], [[Manu River, Tripura|Manu]], [[Juri River|Juri]] and [[Longai River|Longai]] flow towards the north; the [[Gumti River (Tripura)|Gumti]] to the west; and the [[Muhuri River|Muhuri]] and [[Feni River|Feni]] to the south west.<ref name="gsi report"/>{{rp|73}}

The [[lithostratigraphy]] data published by the [[Geological Survey of India]] dates the rocks, on the [[geologic time scale]], between the [[Oligocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], approximately 34 to 23&nbsp;million [[Before Present|years ago]], and the [[Holocene]] epoch, which started 12,000 years ago.<ref name="gsi report"/>{{rp|73–4}} The hills have red [[laterite]] soil that is porous.

The economy of Tripura can be characterised by the high rate of poverty, low capital formation, inadequate infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tripurainfo.com/info/ | title=tripurainfo | access-date=20 June 2015 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619002557/http://www.tripurainfo.com/Info/ | archive-date=19 June 2015}}</ref> However agriculture and allied activities contribution to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resource shortages for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistent progress in the quality of life and income of people across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has not been much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the [[Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tidc.in/G_introduction.html|title=Industrial Growth Centers|publisher=Tripura Industrial Development Corporation Limited, Government of Tripura|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101061459/http://www.tidc.in/G_introduction.html|archive-date=1 January 2014|access-date=27 June 2015}}</ref>

The [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] estimates the poverty rate of all North East Indian states by using headcount ratio of Assam (the second largest state in North East India after Arunachal Pradesh). According to 2001 Planning Commission assessment, 22 per cent of Tripura's rural residents were below the poverty line. However, the Tripura government's independent assessment, based on consumption distribution data, reported that, in 2001, 55 per cent of the rural population was below the poverty line.<ref name="ecorev 2011 77-82"/> Geographic isolation and communication bottlenecks coupled with insufficient infrastructure have restricted economic growth of the state.<ref name="ecorev 2011 8-10"/> High rate of poverty and unemployment continues to be prevalent.<ref name="ecorev 2011 8-10"/>

'''Railway'''<br />
[[File:AGARTALA MAIN STATION.jpg|thumb|left|[[Agartala Railway Station]]]]
Agartala was connected to India's railway network with the advent of the railways in the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] in 1853 but the link was broken when India was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] in 1947. Railway services were established in Tripura in 1964 by constructing {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} track from [[Lumding]] in Assam to [[Dharmanagar]] and [[Kailasahar]] in Tripura but the track did not reach Agartala. Rail transport was absent in the state until 2008–09 when the railway track was extended to the capital Agartala.<ref name="ecorev 2011 195-201"/> The metre gauge rail track was connected to {{Track gauge|5ft6in|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]] at Lumding. The major railway stations in this line are in Agartala, [[Dharmanagar]], and [[Kumarghat]]. This metre gauge track was converted to {{RailGauge|1676mm}} broad gauge in 2016 and now trains run from Agartala to [[Kolkata]] and [[Delhi]]. The total length of this railway track in Tripura state is 153&nbsp;km. It is a single line without electrification. The Agartala sabroom line was coupled and became fully operational from 2019.

A new railway line is being laid westwards from [[Agartala]] to [[Akhaura]] in [[Bangladesh]]. This will reduce the distance between [[Agartala]] and [[Kolkata]] by over 1000&nbsp;km and provide rail access to [[Chittagong]] port.

Some major Express trains that operate from [[Agartala]] are –

{{See also|Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council}}
Most of the area of Tripura is part of the [[Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council|TTAADC]] area, which is an Autonomous Region within Tripura under [[Autonomous administrative divisions of India|6th schedule of the Indian Constitution]] and the western part of Tripura is called the General ward area, where [[Bengalis]] formed the overwhelming majority of the population.<ref name="TTAADC Basic Statistics">{{Cite web |url=http://ttaadc.gov.in/Basic-Statistic |title=TTAADC Basic Statistics |access-date=7 January 2023 |archive-date=7 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230107154055/https://ttaadc.gov.in/Basic-Statistic |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:NE Autonomous divisions of India.svg|266x266px|right|thumb|Autonomous councils in North East India]]
The total area of the TTAADC is about 7,132.56&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, which covers about 68% of the total area (10,491&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of Tripura respectively. It's a thinly populated area of the state with vast area.<ref name="TTAADC Basic Statistics"/>

===Arrival of Bengali refugees===
[[File:Bangladeshi.refugee.jpg|thumb|[[East Bengali refugees]] coming to Tripura during [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh liberation war]].]]
 
During the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]] in 1947, hundreds of thousands of [[East Bengali refugees|Bengali refugees]] fled from [[East Bengal]] into India's Tripura following the Partition of India. It is estimated that between the years 1947–51, around 610,000 [[Bengali Hindus|Bengalis]] — a figure almost equal to the state's total population poured into the state leading to a profound demographic change during this first phase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tripura-where-demand-for-assam-like-nrc-widens-gap-between-indigenous-people-and-non-tribal-settlers/article25348269.ece|title=Tripura, where demand for Assam-like NRC widens gap between indigenous people and non-tribal settlers|first=Rahul|last=Karmakar|date=27 October 2018|access-date=11 November 2021|website=Thehindu.com|archive-date=9 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109040851/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tripura-where-demand-for-assam-like-nrc-widens-gap-between-indigenous-people-and-non-tribal-settlers/article25348269.ece|url-status=live}}</ref> Again during the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] of 1971, in the second phase of migration, around 1.038 million [[Bengalis]] (most being [[Bengali Hindus|Hindus]]) moved into various parts of Tripura as refugees with most of them settling down permanently afterwards.<ref>{{Cite web|title=When Indira Gandhi said: Refugees of all religions must go back – Watch video|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/indira-gandhi-rahul-gandhi-rajiv-gandhi-east-pakistan-pakistan-assam-accord-national-register-of-citizens-congress-bharatiya-janata-party-tripura/264462|access-date=27 October 2021|website=Timesnownews.com|language=en|archive-date=23 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210123092721/https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/indira-gandhi-rahul-gandhi-rajiv-gandhi-east-pakistan-pakistan-assam-accord-national-register-of-citizens-congress-bharatiya-janata-party-tripura/264462|url-status=dead}}</ref> Until Bangladesh liberation war, Tripura had sheltered around 1.3 million refugees.
