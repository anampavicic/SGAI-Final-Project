'''Kragujevac''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Крагујевац}}, {{IPA|sh|krǎɡujeʋats|pron|Kragujevac.ogg}}) is the [[List of cities in Serbia|fourth largest city]] in [[Serbia]] and the administrative centre of the [[Šumadija District]]. It is the historical centre of the geographical region of [[Šumadija]] in central Serbia, and is situated on the banks of the [[Lepenica (Great Morava)|Lepenica River]]. According to the 2022 census, City of Kragujevac has 171,186 inhabitants.

Kragujevac was the first capital of modern Serbia and the first constitution in the [[Balkans]], the [[Sretenje Constitution]], was proclaimed in the city in 1835. A unit of the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]] was located there in World War I. During the Second World War, Kragujevac was the site of a [[Kragujevac massacre|massacre by the Nazis]] in which 2,778 Serb men and boys were killed.

Modern Kragujevac is known for its large munitions ([[Zastava Arms]]) and automobile ([[Fiat Serbia]]) industries, as well as its status as an education centre housing the [[University of Kragujevac]], one of the region's largest higher education institutions.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Kragujevac'' comes from 'kraguj' the Serbian name for [[cinereous vulture]]. In the Middle Ages, this bird was common in the woods of the area, and was used for hunting. The city's name means 'kraguj's tower', and the bird is represented on the city's coat of arms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bakić |first1=Dragoljub |title=Pet vekova Kragujevca |publisher=N.B. Vuk Karadzic Kragujevac |pages=39–40 |language=sh |date=1972}}</ref>

==History==
===Early and medieval===
Over 200 archaeological sites in Šumadija confirm that the region's first human settlement took place around 40,000 years ago during the [[Paleolithic]] era. The Jerina cave, located near the village of [[Gradac, Batočina|Gradac]] in the direction of [[Batočina]], is dated to have been inhabited from around 37,000 [[Before present|BP]] to 27,000 BP. [[Dugout (shelter)|Dugouts]] dated to 5,000 BC have been found in the city's vicinity, in the localities of [[Grivac (Knić)|Grivac]], [[Kusovac]], [[Divostin]], [[Donje Grbice]] and [[Dobrovodica]].<ref name="Politika">{{Citation|author=Brane Kartalović|title=Kragujevac od paleolita do oslobođenja|newspaper=[[Politika]]|page=14|language=sr|date=22 August 2017|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/387370/Kragujevac-od-paleolita-do-oslobodenja|access-date=23 August 2017|archive-date=23 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823162142/http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/387370/Kragujevac-od-paleolita-do-oslobodenja|url-status=live}}</ref> These remains belong to the [[Neolithic]] [[Starčevo culture]], which, in this area, spread along the river valleys of Lepenica and [[Gruža (river)|Gruža]]. The best known artifacts are the fertility figurines called ''Divostinke'' ("Girls from Divostin").<ref>{{cite news | author = Brane Kartalović | title = Neolit u srcu Šumadije | trans-title = Neolithic in the heart of Šumadija | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = sr | date = 29 June 2021 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/482278/Neolit-u-srcu-Sumadije | access-date = 6 July 2021 | archive-date = 4 July 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210704043324/https://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/482278/Neolit-u-srcu-Sumadije | url-status = live }}</ref>

At the time of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest in 9 AD, the territory of the present-day city was largely inhabited by [[Illyrians]] (mainly the [[Dardani]]) and [[Celts]] (the [[Scordisci]]).<ref name="Politika" /> By the late 6th and early 7th centuries, large-scale Slavic raids and settlement began, along with invasions from [[Huns|Hunnic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes. Later, the area would become part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. With the weakening of both the Bulgarian and [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] empires, [[Stefan Nemanja]], Grand Prince of the consolidated [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|medieval Serbian state]], captured the territory between 1198 and 1199. Although it is hypothesized that the current area of the city was densely settled by the time of Stefan Nemanja's conquest, it does not appear in medieval Serbian documents.<ref name="Politika" />

The first written mention of the city was in an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Cadastral surveying|cadastral survey]] (''[[defter]]'') in 1476 after the city's incorporation into the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/TapuTahrirDefteri491|title=Tapu Tahrir Defteri 491: Ottoman government: Free Download & Streaming Internet Archive|year=1569|access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref> Referred to as 'Kraguyfoça', the settlement, after Ottoman conquest, consisted of a square formerly used as a market with 32 houses. The surrounding region was largely empty; even the forests that once dominated the region had been burned. By the end of the same century, however, the Ottoman administration began to slowly resettle the city's area; by the 1536 cadastral survey, the town had 7 Muslim neighborhoods ([[Mahala|''mahalas'']]) with 56 houses in total, along with a Christian community of 29 houses. On the left bank of the Lepenica, a mosque was erected.<ref name="Politika" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/51.gif|format=GIF|title=Map of the Belgrade Pashaluk|publisher=Terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-date=29 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929230342/http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/51.gif|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Habsburg-Ottoman conflict and major revolts===
In spite of its newfound consolidation under Turkish rule, the town's location in strategic borderland between the [[Habsburg monarchy]] and the Ottoman Empire made it an area of frequent conflict in the modern era. During the [[Great Turkish War]], the Austrians, under [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis of Baden]], pushed the Turks far to the south of the city. Although this occupation was short-lived, it spelled an end to consolidated Ottoman rule in the region. Soon after, in 1718, Kragujevac became a part of the [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686–91)|Habsburg Kingdom of Serbia]] following conquest by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and the signing of [[Treaty of Passarowitz]].

Under Austrian occupation, Kragujevac was fortified, the Muslim population was driven out and it became an uskok town. It was exclusively inhabited by Serbian Orthodox members of the national militia with their families. As one of the districts lying right on the Ottoman border, moreover, it was controlled by an [[Uskoks|uskok]] company (of the fourteen that guarded the frontier) and found itself under military jurisdiction.  Accordingly, its chief was a Serbian military officer, First Captain [[Staniša Marković Mlatišuma]], the second highest authority of the [[Serbian Militia (1718–1739)|Serbian militia]]. In 1725 the first officially recorded cases of [[vampirism]] occurred in Kragujevac, in which two alleged vampires were accused of murdering 42 people.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Marín |first=Álvaro García |date=2021-01-01 |title=Analysis of a 1725 Report of Vampirism in Kragujevac |url=https://www.academia.edu/53330102 |journal=Journal of Vampire Studies |access-date=8 July 2023 |archive-date=6 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231006195022/https://www.academia.edu/53330102 |url-status=live }}</ref> In other parts of Habsburg ruled Kingdom of Serbia similar cases followed after which the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] word vampir entered [[German language|German]] and later other world languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.glassumadije.rs/prvi-i-najkrvaviviji-vampiri-u-istoriji-bili-su-iz-kragujevca/|title = Prvi i najkrvaviviji vampiri u istoriji bili su iz Kragujevca|date = 20 September 2020|access-date = 27 April 2021|archive-date = 27 April 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210427111841/http://www.glassumadije.rs/prvi-i-najkrvaviviji-vampiri-u-istoriji-bili-su-iz-kragujevca/|url-status = live}}</ref> As the Ottomans retook the town in 1739, and lost it again in 1789 to the same enemy, the town was ripe for new rule—this time under Serbian rebels.<ref name="Politika" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/6_15_l.html|title=Kočina Krajina|publisher=Projekat Rastko|access-date=6 January 2016|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064622/http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/6_15_l.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Wiki Šumadija XVI National Museum of Kragujevac 843.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A scale model of royal complex founded by [[Miloš Obrenović]]]]

As a settlement central to the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] under Ottoman rule, Kragujevac was of utmost strategic importance to its agitating, largely rural Serb inhabitants. Therefore, it became a centre of the [[Serbian Revolution]], a national awakening of Serbs led by the grand ''[[vožd]]'', [[Karađorđe]]. First liberated on 5 April 1804 during the [[First Serbian Uprising]], the city was finally freed from imperial rule during the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] in 1815.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

In 1818, Kragujevac, though largely depopulated following the conflicts of the preceding centuries, was proclaimed capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] on 6 May 1818 by [[Miloš Obrenović]] in the medieval [[Vraćevšnica monastery]]. To mark the occasion, he built the Royal residence on the left bank of the Lepenica river. [[Amidža Konak]] is the only remaining building from the complex and the only landmark of 19th century Ottoman architecture in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/p/m/170468/b|title=Photos of San Antonio – Images of San Antonio, Texas, USA|publisher=Members.virtualtourist.com|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630150212/http://members.virtualtourist.com//m/p/m/170468/b|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first institutions of the Principality of Serbia were founded in Kragujevac including the first courthouse, [[First Kragujevac Gymnasium|First gymnasium]] (grammar school) and the [[Princely Serbian Theatre|Princely Serbian theatre]]. The first Serbian constitution, the [[Sretenje Constitution]], was proclaimed in the city on 15 September 1835. It was one of the most liberal European constitutions of its time, modeled on the French and Belgian constitutions.

=== Industrial development ===
Although the capital was moved from Kragujevac to [[Belgrade]] in 1841, the importance of Kragujevac only increased during the remainder of the 19th century as it grew into a city marked by its industry. Following centuries of economic underdevelopment, the underpinnings of the city's modernization—and Serbia's main munitions manufacturer, [[Zastava Arms]]—were laid in the commissioning of the city's foundry complex in 1835. Known under its Serbian acronym VTZ, the complex was completed in 1850, and the first cannon was cast in 1853. Colloquially styled the 'Knez's arsenal', its first director, Charles Loubry, was a French engineer authorized to take over this duty by the Emperor of France, Napoleon III.<ref name="leva">{{cite news|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/395463/Kragujevac-se-seli-na-desnu-obalu-Lepenice|title=Kragujevac se seli na desnu obalu Lepenice|author=Brane Kartalović|date=29 December 2017|newspaper=Politika|language=sr|trans-title=Kragujevac moves over to the right bank of the Lepenica|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-date=3 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103011626/http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/395463/Kragujevac-se-seli-na-desnu-obalu-Lepenice|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Topolivnica_1856.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Kragujevac cannon foundry in its working days as part of the VTZ]]

Following the creation of the VTZ, industrial development continued at an unprecedented pace. The first [[telephone exchange]] was installed in 1858, and in 1868 the first industrial brewery was opened by Nikola Mesarović. The first printing press was founded in 1870. To connect the city's burgeoning military industry as well as its production of iron ploughs to the rest of Serbia's regions, the [[Belgrade]]–[[Niš]] railroad was built in 1886. To serve its industrial population, Serbia's first grammar school (''gimnazija)'', the city's first pharmacy, and its first cinema, located in a local ''kafana'', were all built during the remainder of the 19th century, along with Kragujevac's Great (or Upper) Park and, in 1891, its first regulatory urban plan.<ref name="Politika" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceofserbia.org/serbia/node/152|title=Kragujevac &#124; Beautiful Serbia|publisher=Voiceofserbia.org|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112730/http://voiceofserbia.org/serbia/node/152|url-status=live}}</ref> The city's industrialism characterized it among its European peers, along with its workers' demonstrations, known as the ''Crveni barjak'' ('Red banner') demonstrations, first held on 27 February 1876.<ref name="leva" />
Today, the beginnings of the town's industry, the now-defunct VTZ, have been recognized by the Serbian government as vital to Serbia's cultural heritage and, as of 2017, consists of 151 individual objects, of which 31 are protected as unique heritage, including the old foundry, the machine workshop, the chimney, the [[fire lookout tower]], the railroad bridge over the Lepenica River, and the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] factory. Once known by its non-industrial residents as the 'Forbidden City' (''Zabranjeni Grad),'' the complex is now open to the public.<ref name="leva" />

=== World War I ===
During [[World War I]], Kragujevac again became the capital of Serbia (1914–1915), and the seat of many state institutions—the Supreme Army Command was housed within the courthouse building.<ref name="Politika" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/kragujevac-stadt_44145.html|title=Kragujevac (Stadt)|publisher=En.europeonline-magazine.eu|date=21 October 1941|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-date=23 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823165258/http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/kragujevac-stadt_44145.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital for Women's Service was based there from  December 1914 to November 1915. A list of those working in the hospital can be viewed on the website "Imperial War Museum: Lives of the First World War " and more information on these units is below.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scottish Women's Hospitals - Unit at Kraguievatz, Serbia|url=https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/community/3702/?page=2|access-date=13 October 2021|website=Imperial War Museum: Lives of the First World War|archive-date=17 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230717084940/https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/community/3702/?page=2|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the war, Kragujevac lost around 15% of its population. On the night of 2 June 1918, a group of occupying Slovak soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian 71st infantry regiment mutinied in the city centre. The soldiers, led by Viktor Kolibík, had recently returned from captivity in Russia and were to be immediately deployed to the Italian Front. The mutiny failed, and 44 mutineers were executed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telecom.gov.sk/externe/znamky/1998/98152e.html|title=Kragujevac 1918|website=telecom.gov.sk|access-date=4 August 2016|archive-date=24 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524212603/http://www.telecom.gov.sk/externe/znamky/1998/98152e.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Yugoslavia===
{{Main|Kragujevac massacre|Zastava Automobiles}}
Following World War I, Kragujevac became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. In the period before the Second World War, the city continued its cultural and economic development with the founding of the Gundulić Theatre and the Kragujevac Academic Theatre as well as a number of new factories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joakimvujic.com/english.php|title=Knjaževsko-Srpski Teatar|publisher=Joakimvujic.com|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008095136/http://www.joakimvujic.com/english.php|archive-date=8 October 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:King-Peter's-street.jpg|thumb|right|King Peter's Street]]
Following the Nazi [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], the city came under [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|direct Nazi occupation]]. After a joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]]-[[Chetniks|Chetnik]] attack on German forces in nearby [[Gornji Milanovac]], ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]] calculated that 50 people were to be shot for every German soldier wounded and 100 people were to be shot for every German soldier killed. [[Franz Böhme]] therefore ordered the deaths of nearly 2,800 men and boys between 19 and 21 October 1941 in the [[Kragujevac massacre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.co.rs/srbija.php?id=16913|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730223552/http://www.blic.co.rs/srbija.php?id=16913|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 July 2012|title=Blic Online: "Engleska krvava bajka" u Kragujevcu|publisher=Blic.co.rs|access-date=16 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hitler's new disorder: the Second World War in Yugoslavia|author=Stevan K.

The city was liberated from Nazi Germany on 21 October 1944.<ref name="Politika" />

In the post-war period, Kragujevac continued to develop its industry. Its main products were passenger cars, trucks and industrial vehicles, hunting arms, industrial chains, leather, and textiles. The biggest industry was [[Zastava Automobiles]], which at one point employed tens of thousands people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceofserbia.org/serbia/node/152|title=About Zastava Kragujevac|publisher=Voice of Serbia|access-date=6 January 2016|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112730/http://voiceofserbia.org/serbia/node/152|url-status=live}}</ref>

The first product of the [[Zastava Automobiles]] car company, the FIAT 750, was manufactured in 1955 under a licence to [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat Automobiles (now Fiat Serbia)]]. In the following three decades, more than five million passenger cars (FIAT 750, Zastava 1300, Zastava 101, Zastava 128, Zastava Yugo, Yugo Florida, [[Fiat 500L]]) were manufactured and marketed in 74 countries worldwide.<ref name="Welcome to Zastava-arms">{{cite web|url=http://www.zastava-arms.rs/|title=Welcome to Zastava-arms|publisher=Zastava-arms.rs|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-date=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701085041/http://www.zastava-arms.rs/|url-status=live}}</ref> Perhaps most famous among the automobiles produced is the [[Yugo]], also marketed as the Zastava Korral.

The city's industry greatly suffered under [[Sanctions against Yugoslavia|international economic sanctions]] during the [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]] era in the 1990s, and some parts were reduced to rubble in the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO aggression against FR Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/Europe-old/zastava.html|title="Collateral damage" and the workers of the Zastava factory|publisher=Marxist.com|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202917/http://www.marxist.com/Europe-old/zastava.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city today remains an industrial heart of Serbia, and has grown with the influx of students and refugees from the Yugoslav wars. In 2010, the city government signed a memorandum with the German development agency [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]] and in 2012 city hall adopted a strategy of urban development of the central city zone to be completed by 2030. As of December 2017, many objects within the complex deteriorated and the right bank of the Lepenica is urbanistically neglected. The authenticity and representative values of the complex must be preserved, but where it is allowed, the industrial and workers quarters will be transformed into the residential and commercial areas, traffic corridors and used for the numerous educational and cultural institutions Serbia's industrial city continues to cherish.<ref name=leva/>

===Cityscape===
The architecture of Kragujevac displays a fusion of many different styles. Historically, Ottoman (nowadays almost completely gone) and 19th century [[Vienna Secession]] style architecture have played an important role in the city's landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kucacolovica.com/en/kragujevac-city-tour.html|title=Kragujevac-City Tour – Kuća Čolovića|publisher=Kucacolovica.com|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310204632/http://kucacolovica.com/en/kragujevac-city-tour.html|archive-date=10 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Newer architecture dominates the city's panorama. A blend of Viennese, Balkan as well as [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalism]] is present, as showcased in the monuments to the Kragujevac massacre.<ref name="explanders">{{cite web |last1=Westmark |first1=Omri |title=A Glimpse of Kragujevac (Photography & Impressions) |url=https://explanders.com/europe-arctic-circle/serbia/kragujevac/ |website=explanders.com |date=29 October 2020 |access-date=18 May 2022 |archive-date=11 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220811210302/https://explanders.com/europe-arctic-circle/serbia/kragujevac/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Post-war concrete apartment blocks built during the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] period are prominent.<ref name="explanders" /> Today, glass office buildings reflect the ambitious business aspirations of the city.
