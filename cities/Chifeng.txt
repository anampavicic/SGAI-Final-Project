==History==
[[Image:C-shaped jade dragon.jpg|thumb|left|The C-shaped jade dragon of the Hongshan Culture|151x151px]]
According to archeological studies, human occupation of the Chifeng area can be traced back at least ten thousand years, and [[Neolithic]] cultural history can be traced back nearly eight thousand years. Representative ruins and relics of [[Hongshan Culture]], Grassland Bronze Culture, [[Khitan people|Khitan]] Liao Culture and [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol-Yuan]] Culture have been discovered in Chifeng. The ruins of an ancient village, named [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]], and the biggest jade dragon unearthed in the area are noted as "the first village" and "the first dragon" by some. The discovery of ruins and relics of ancient cultures have come from more than 6,800 sites. Named after Chifeng's [[Hongshan District, Chifeng|Hongshan District]], [[Hongshan culture|Hongshan Culture]] was a Neolithic culture in northeastern China, whose sites have been found mainly in Chifeng, and dated from about 4700 to 2900 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_chron.shtm |title=The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology - NGA |access-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408032920/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_chron.shtm |archive-date=8 April 2014}} Timeline posted by National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.</ref>

The area surrounding Chifeng was the political center of the [[Liao dynasty]], and home to the Liao capital [[Shangjing Linhuangfu]]. Therefore, the amount of ruins and relics of the [[Liao dynasty|Liao Dynasty]] in Chifeng is ranked the most important in China. During the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], today's Chifeng region was under the administration of 'Ju Ud League', one of the six original Leagues in Inner Mongolia. Mongolian [[Banner (Inner Mongolia)|Banners (county level regions)]] were organized into conventional assemblies at the league level. In republican era, Chifeng was under the administration of [[Rehe Province]], along with parts of today's Liaoning and Hebei including [[Chaoyang, Liaoning|Chaoyang]] and [[Chengde]]. After the Mukden Incident in 1931, the Japanese puppet state [[Manchukuo]] was established in [[Changchun|Xinjing]] (today's Jilin provincial capital Changchun), and Ju Ud League was captured by Manchukuo in 1933.<ref name="Zhang敏昶2005">{{cite book |author=德力格尔玛 |script-title=zh:伪满洲国统治内蒙古东部地区的行政机构及其演变 |url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/ZWDM200606010.htm |access-date=9 September 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143220/http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/ZWDM200606010.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref> Chifeng was established as the third largest city of Rehe Province after Chengde and Chaoyang. After [[Operation August Storm]], the Soviet-Mongolian Cavalry-Mechanized Group entered Chifeng. After Rehe Province was rendered defunct in 1955, Chifeng was placed administratively under the newly established Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region under [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] rule, whose provincial seat was previously at [[Ulanhot]] and transferred to Zhangjiakou and then Hohhot in the 1950s. In the 1970s, going by the name Juud League, Chifeng was under the administration of Liaoning province. After 1979, Chifeng was under Inner Mongolian rule, and Ju Ud League was dissolved on 10 October 1983.

==Geography==
[[File:红山 - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|left|Hongshan, the "Red Hill", from which Chifeng received its name.]]
Chifeng is situated along the upper reaches of the [[Xiliao River]]. Within its area are the southwesternmost extension of the [[Greater Khingan]], the [[:zh:内蒙古高原|Inner Mongolia Plateau]] as well as the Xiliao River Plain, and finally the northernmost extent of the [[Yan Mountains]]. Bordering prefecture-level divisions are [[Tongliao]] to the northeast, [[Chaoyang, Liaoning|Chaoyang]] ([[Liaoning]]) to the southeast, [[Chengde]] ([[Hebei]]) to the south, and the [[Xilingol League]] and to the west. From north to south Chifeng City stretches {{cvt|457.5|km}}, while from east to west it stretches {{cvt|375|km}}. Elevations decrease from a high of {{cvt|2067|m}} in the west to less than {{cvt|300|m|sigfig=2}} in the east.
