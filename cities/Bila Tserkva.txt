'''Bila Tserkva''' ({{langx|uk|Біла Церква}} {{IPA|uk|ˈbilɐ ˈtsɛrkwɐ||audio=Uk-Біла Церква.ogg}}; {{literally|'White Church'}}, {{langx|pl|Biała Cerkiew}}) is a city in central [[Ukraine]]. It is situated on the [[Ros (river)|Ros River]] in the historical region of [[right-bank Ukraine]]. It is the largest city in [[Kyiv Oblast]] (which does not include the city of [[Kyiv]]) and serves as the administrative centre of [[Bila Tserkva Raion]] and Bila Tserkva urban [[Hromadas of Ukraine|hromada]],<ref name="admreform_2020_bila_tserkva">{{cite web |title=Белоцерковская городская громада |url=https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/bila-cerkva/ |publisher=Портал об'єднаних громад України |language=ru}}</ref> and has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|207,273|.}}, 205,000 (2024 estimate).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Візіком карти |url=https://maps.visicom.ua/c/30.11267,49.80039,17?lang=uk |access-date=2024-10-28 |website=maps.visicom.ua |language=uk}}</ref> 

The oldest preserved document that mentions the city, at that time called ''Yuryiv'', is the ''[[Hypatian Codex]]'' (1115). Historically, the city has been at the centre of the ''Porossia'' (River Ros) region. Founded as a border fortification of [[Kievan Rus']], Bila Tserkva later became property of [[Polish nobility]] and served as a prominent commercial centre. Since the 19th century, industry and tourism have been important elements of the city's economy. Under [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet rule]], Bila Tserkva became a centre of agricultural education. During the [[Cold War]], a major [[Soviet Air Force]] base was located near the city.

As part of independent Ukraine, Bila Tserkva served as a city of regional significance until 2020. In the aftermath of the administrative reform, it became the centre of one of ''hromadas'' (communities) of Kyiv Oblast.

==History==

Founded in 1032, the city was originally named [[:uk:Юр'їв|Yuriiv]] by [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav the Wise]], whose Christian name was Yuri. The contemporary name of the city, literally translated, is "White Church" and may refer to the white-painted cathedral (no longer extant) of medieval Yuriiv.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bila Tserkva|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CB%5CI%5CBilaTserkva.htm|access-date=2022-01-17|website=encyclopediaofukraine.com}}</ref> In its long history, Bila Tserkva spent its first few hundred years privately owned, later, though the owner was typically a citizen of the ruling empire, it was organized as a [[Fief|fiefdom]], with important trade routes to Kyiv, Hungary, the Middle East and India, passing through it.

From its earliest incarnation, Bila Tserkva was considered to provide important defense against nomadic tribes that included both the [[Cumans]] and the [[Tatars]]. However, a 13th century invasion by the [[Mongols]] devastated the city, and illustrated the fallibility of its defense.<ref name=":4">Kohut, Zenon E. "Mazepa's Ukraine: Understanding Cossack Territorial Vistas." ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 31, no. 1/4 (2009): 1–28. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/41756495].</ref>

=== Lithuanian and Polish rule ===
From 1363, Bila Tserkva belonged to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and from 1569 to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] within the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], administratively in the [[Kijów Voivodeship]], part of [[Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Lesser Poland Province]]. It was crown property, but in recognition of his great service, it was granted to the [[Castellan]] of [[Kraków]], [[Janusz Ostrogski]]. The next owner was [[Stanisław Lubomirski (1583–1649)]] and during his time the town was granted [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg Rights]] by [[Sigismund III Vasa]] in 1620.

[[File:Battle of the Bila Tserkva by Westerveld.jpg|thumb|Battle of Biała Cerkiew, 1651]]
After subduing the rebellious [[Cossack uprisings|Cossacks]] in the 1626 [[Battle of Bila Tserkva (1626)|Battle of Bila Tserkva]], the next owner of the estate was Prince Jerzy Dymitr Wiśniowiecki. The castle was successfully taken by [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] in 1648. In 1651, it was also the site of the [[Battle of Bila Tserkva (1651)|Battle of Bila Tserkva]] between the warring [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Cossack Army]] (and their [[Crimean Khanate|Tatar allies]]) and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but Bila Tserkva was also where they made peace, and signed a [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva|Treaty]].<ref name=":5" /><ref>[[Paul Robert Magocsi]], ''A history of Ukraine'', University of Toronto Press, 1996, p. 205</ref> It was also where peace was achieved with the signing of the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]].<ref name=":5">PERNAL, A. B. "The Expenditures of the Crown Treasury for the Financing of Diplomacy between Poland and the Ukraine during the Reign of Jan Kazimierz." ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 5, no. 1 (1981): 102–20. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/41035895].</ref> In 1666, six-thousand Muscovite troops laid siege to Bila Tserkva. The standoff lasted until the following year when Polish reinforcements led by Jan Stachurski with the aid of allied Cossacks and [[Iwan Brzuchowiecki]] smashed [[Petro Doroshenko]]'s stranglehold.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

The next owner was [[Great Crown Hetman]] [[Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski|Stanislaw Jan Jabłonowski.]] In 1702, the castle was taken by the Cossack leader, [[Semen Paliy]] who made it his domain. In 1708, the town was overrun by prince [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Golitsyn|Golitsyn]]'s Russian army. The next owner of the town was [[Jan Stanisław Jabłonowski|Jan Stanislaw Jabłonowski]], then Stanisław Wincenty Jabłonowski who erected a catholic church. After him ownership passed to Jerzy August Mniszech. The town was substantially refortified.

In 1774, Bila Tserkva (Biała Cerkiew), then the seat of the sub-prefecture ([[Starostwo]]), came into the possession of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] who that same year granted the property to [[Franciszek Ksawery Branicki]], [[Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland's Grand Hetman]] who then built his urban residence, the [[:uk:Зимовий палац (Біла Церква)|Winter Palace]] complex and a country residence with the [[Arboretum Oleksandriya|"Oleksandriia"]] Arboretum (named after his wife [[:pl:Aleksandra Branicka|Aleksandra Branicka]]). He founded the Catholic Church of John the Baptist, and started construction of the Orthodox church, which was completed by his successor, his son Count [[Władysław Grzegorz Branicki]]. The latter also built the gymnasium-school complex in Bila Tserkva. Aleksander Branicki, the youngest grandson of the hetman, renovated and finished Mazepa's Orthodox church. Under the rule of count Władysław Michał Branicki, Bila Tserkva developed into a regional commercial and manufacturing centre.<ref>E. A. Chernecki, L. P. Mordatenko, ''Bila Tserkva. Branicki family.

Various Polish [[Crown Army]] units were stationed in the city at various times, including the 5th and 6th National Cavalry Brigades and 4th Infantry Regiment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gembarzewski|first=Bronisław|title=Rodowody pułków polskich i oddziałów równorzędnych od r. 1717 do r. 1831|year=1925|language=pl|publisher=Towarzystwo Wiedzy Wojskowej|location=Warszawa|pages=8–9, 27}}</ref>

=== The Russian Empire ===
[[File:Bila Tserkva, synagogue.jpg|thumb|Bila Tserkva in 1915]]
In 1791, Russia's [[Catherine II]], included Bila Tserkva in the region that came to be known as the [[Pale of Settlement]], which encompassed parts of seven contemporary nations, including large swaths of modern-day Ukraine.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web |title=The Pale of Settlement |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/image/pale-settlement |access-date=2022-04-01 |website=Facing History and Ourselves |archive-date=18 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318225615/https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/image/pale-settlement |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bila Tserkva was formally annexed into the [[Russian Empire]] as a result of the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ukraine's fraught relationship with Russia: A brief history |url=https://theweek.com/articles/449691/ukraines-fraught-relationship-russia-brief-history |access-date=2022-01-17 |website=The Week |date=8 March 2014 |language=en}}</ref> Meanwhile, after 1861, the Czarist authorities converted Roman Catholic churches into Orthodox Churches.<ref>Lucjan Blit, The origins of Polish socialism: the history and ideas of the first Polish Socialist Party 1878–1886, Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 21</ref> By the late 18th century, however, Jews were already living in the region, and within a century they would comprise nearly half the population of the city.<ref name=":10" /> An important Jewish city, as a result, by the early 1900s it was a fount of idea about politics, religion, art, and culture, with an active [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, an active branch of the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist]] movement and a branch of the Society of United Slavs formulating"plans to assassinate Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] by Sergei Muravev-Apostol and his co-conspirators."<ref name=":3" /> Home to many artists and writers, [[Sholem Aleichem]] and [[Shaye Shkarovsky]] were both writing in Yiddish, with [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]] writing in Ukrainian.

=== Soviet rule and Nazi occupation ===
During the first two decades of the 20th century, the city's Jewish residents were subject to multiple pogroms. In 1919 and 1920 alone, pogroms were responsible for the deaths of 850 Jews.<ref name=":14" /> In 1932–1933, as many as 22,000 of greater Bila Tserkva's residents died in the [[Holodomor]].<ref name=":6">Boryssenko, Valentyna, Lisa Vapné, and Anne Coldefy-Faucart.

===Independent Ukraine===
Until 18 July 2020, Bila Tserkva was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and served as the administrative center of Bila Tserkva Raion even though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven, the city of Bila Tserkva was merged into Bila Tserkva Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.
