== History ==

=== Early history ===
The history of Cherkasy has not been thoroughly explored. The year of establishment is considered by historians to be 1286 on the [[Kievan Rus']] territory. There are few facts about the beginning of the city, but it is documented that Cherkasy existed in the 14th century. The first record about Cherkasy dates from 1305 in the ''[[Gustynskiy Chronicle]]'', which is the Kievan Rus' chronicle. The city is mentioned as an existing city among other Kievan Rus' cities, including [[Kiev]], [[Kaniv]], [[Zhytomyr]] and [[Ovruch]].

The city became one of the centres of the [[Cossacks#Ukrainian Cossacks|Cossack movement]]. Citizens took part in the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Khmelnychchyna]] of 1648-1657 and in the [[Koliivshchyna|Koliivschyna]] of 1768–1769. The city was influenced by the cruel social and economical experiments of [[Soviet]] authorities and by [[World War II]]. In 1954 Cherkasy became the administrative centre of [[Cherkasy Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]), the youngest oblast of Ukraine.

=== Under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===
[[File:Dymitr Wiśniowiecki Bajda.PNG|left|thumb|150px|[[Dmytro Vyshnevetsky|Dmytro Baida-Vyshnevetskiy]], Cherkasy headman]]
[[File:Dashkevich.PNG|right|thumb|150px|[[Ostap Dashkevych]], Cherkasy headman]]

In the 1360s the city entered a new period in its development, becoming a part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Cherkasy became an important defender of the southern borders of the Grand Duchy. In 1384 the city was recognized as a fortified town on the southern edge (of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), forming along with [[Vinnytsia]], Bratslav and [[Kaniv]] part of a defensive line against [[Crimean Tatars]]. The city started to be ruled by a headman (starosta).

From the end of the 15th until the beginning of the 16th centuries, the post of {{ill|Cherkasy headman|uk|Черкаське староство}} was held by the prominent persons of that time&nbsp;– {{ill|Bogdan Glinskiy|ru|Глинский, Богдан Фёдорович}} (in office: 1488–1495), {{ill|Kmyta Oleksandrovych|uk|Кміта Олександрович}} (in office: 1494–1500), Vasyl Dashkevych ({{langx |uk| Василь Дашкович Глинський }}, in office: 1504–1507), [[Andrzej Niemirowicz|Andriy Nemyrovych]] (in office: 1511–1514), [[Ostap Dashkevych|Ostafiy Dashkevych]] (in office: 1514–1535), Vasyl Tyshkevych, [[Dmytro Vyshnevetsky|Dmytro Baida-Vyshnevetskiy]] (in office: 1550–1553) etc.

During the 15th and 16th centuries Cherkasy was one of the main centres that helped the Cossacks in the peopling of the Ukrainian south. Citizens took part in military campaigns against Tatars and Turks, including operations led by [[Ivan Pidkova]] (died 1578). New Cherkasy Castle, built in 1549–52 on the place of the old one, was the centre of city life.

=== Under Polish rule, Khmelnytsky Uprising ===
[[File:BChmielnicki.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]]]
After the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 Cherkasy became a part of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]]. Cherkasy Regiment, which was created in 1625, played a big role in history of the city. During the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] the regiment became administrative-territorial subdivision (until 1686). During that time Cherkasy's Regiment was one of the most powerful military units and took part in all of the battles for Bohdan Khmelnytsky army. After a successful campaign, Khmelnytsky in 1654 signed an alliance with Muscovy at Pereyaslav. The war ended in 1667 with the [[Truce of Andrusovo]]. Cherkasy remained part of Poland, but territories east of the Dnieper River including [[left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Zaporizhia (region)|Zaporizhia]] were secured for Muscovy.
While in the Polish Kingdom the city was a seat of the county (powiat) which belonged to a greater unit – the [[Kyiv Voivodeship]] of the [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown|Lesser Poland Province]] until 1793. In 1768 during the [[Koliyivshchyna]] turmoils the city was severely damaged and pillaged. In 1791 the city gained [[Magdeburg rights]]. It was a [[royal city]] of Poland. After the [[Second Partition of Poland]] the city was incorporated into the Kievan Guberniya of [[Imperial Russia]].

=== 19th – early 20th centuries ===
[[File:Cherkasy plan 1826.PNG|thumb|right|City plan as of 1826]]
Since the beginning of the 19th century the city was planned by Russian architect, civil engineer and town planner of Scottish descent, William Heste. After the second division of Poland in 1793, Cherkasy became part of the Russian Empire. From 1797 it was a {{transl|uk|[[Uyezd|povitove]]}} town of [[Kyiv Governorate]]. In the second half of the 19th century the city experienced a great economical growth. After the railroad appeared in the city, a lot of new industrial enterprises were built. Sugar, tobacco, metalwork, mechanical engineering and trade industries were at peak development at that time. Architect [[William Heste]] made a general development plan for the city, which involved building square blocks with straight streets.

=== [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], Second World War and Soviet period ===
[[File:Holodomor Monument in Cherkasy.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Monument to [[Holodomor]] victims]]
After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917 Cherkasy fell under [[Bolshevik]] control. After that, however, the city changed its ruler at least 18 times&nbsp;– during the civil war it was conquered by hetman [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], then again by Bolsheviks, later by [[Nykyfor Hryhoriv]]. On 1 January 1920, the city finally and for a long period fell under Soviet rule. As with all villages and towns in the area, it was a victim of man-made famine in 1932–1933 ([[Holodomor]]) and a [[Great Purge]] (a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union organised by Joseph Stalin in 1936–1938).
[[File:war monument in cherkasy.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to the Warriors of the 254th Infantry Division, Liberators of Cherkasy]]
[[World War II|The Second World War]] damaged the city greatly. On [[Operation Barbarossa|22 June 1941]], German bombers attacked Cherkasy. For two months soldiers defended the city, but on 22 August, the invaders took the city. On 14 December 1943, Cherkasy was liberated from the German invaders. After the end of the war, the city began to recover after being almost obliterated. According to [[Five-year plans of the Soviet Union|5-year plans]], the city began to re-develop its economy, infrastructure and socio-cultural sphere. In 1954 the city became the administrative centre of [[Cherkasy Oblast]] (province), the youngest among other oblasts in [[Ukraine]]. In the 1960s Cherkasy became the chemical giant of the [[Ukrainian SSR]], after "Azot" (the biggest nitrogen fertilizer producing plant), "Khimvolokno" (artificial fiber manufacturing plant), "Khimreaktyv" (chemical reagents for military purposes) and many others were built in the city. In 1961 a Kremenchuk hydro power plant was built, forming the Kremenchuk Water Reservoir, which Cherkasy is now standing on. This makes the city a big transport hub, serving the longest [[Levee|dyke]] in Ukraine (15&nbsp;km) with rail and road on it.

=== Independence from the Soviet Union ===
Since gaining independence, industry in the city has declined, along with the number of citizens and living standards. A lot of big and powerful factories and plants were privatized but couldn't survive in a competitive market. Some enterprises changed their profile&nbsp;– several (3) factories and plants around the city were united under the "[[Bogdan Corporation]]" and started production of buses and cars. Some of the companies remained working and became successful, like [[Azot (Cherkasy)|"Azot"]].
On 28 November 2008, the monument of Lenin was removed from the central square. This caused different reactions in different people. Now the central square, formerly called "Lenin Square", is called "Soborna Square" (Cathedral Square). The square was recently renovated.
In 2009, Cherkasy airport received International Airport status ([[IATA]]: CKC&nbsp;– [[ICAO]]: UKKE).

Until 18 July 2020, Cherkasy was designated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and belonged to [[Cherkasy Municipality]] but not to Cherkasy Raion even though it was the centre of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Cherkasy Oblast to four, the city was merged into Cherkasy Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів. Постанова Верховної Ради України № 807-ІХ.|url=http://www.golos.com.ua/article/333466|access-date=2020-10-03|date=2020-07-18|website=Голос України|language=uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Нові райони: карти + склад |url=https://www.minregion.gov.ua/press/news/novi-rajony-karty-sklad/ |publisher=Міністерство розвитку громад та територій України |language=uk}}</ref>

The city has occasionally seen Russian air strikes and missile attacks as a result of the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], but has so far been untouched by ground-based warfare.

== Transportation ==

=== Public transportation ===
[[Public transportation]] is represented by [[List of trolleybus systems in Ukraine#Cherkasy Oblast|trolleybuses]] and [[bus]]es. Trolleybuses started serving the city in 1965, and now are operating on 10 routes, from approximately 6 am till 11 pm. The fleet is old, and mostly consists of [[ZiU-9]] and [[ZiU-10]] vehicles. Recently, 3 new trolleybuses (manufactured by [[Lviv Bus Factory|LAZ]]) appeared in the city. Buses are mostly represented with "Etalon", [[Bogdan (bus)|"Bohdan"]], and [[Pavlovo Bus Factory|"PAZ"]] buses.

=== Roads ===
[[File:From bridge at Cherkasy, 2006.5.JPG|thumb|left|View from bridge (P10) over railway and H16]]
Cherkasy is a big [[transport hub]] due to its location in the centre of the country.
Two major automobile routes go through the city – <span style="background:blue; color:white">&nbsp;H16&nbsp;</span> ([[Uman]]-[[Zolotonosha]], national route) and <span style="background:grey; color:white">&nbsp;P10&nbsp;</span> ([[Kaniv]]-[[Kremenchuk]], regional route). There is a 4-lane highway between Cherkasy and [[Smila, Ukraine|Smila]] (which is a part of Cherkasy Urban Agglomeration). The roads are in poor technical condition and road maintenance is poor.
