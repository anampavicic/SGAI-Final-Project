'''Sunderland''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Sunderland.ogg|ˈ|s|ʌ|n|d|ər|l|ə|n|d}}) is a [[port city]]{{efn|This article is primarily about the built-up area, which does not have legal city status of itself, but is widely regarded as a city since it is the main and nominate settlement in the City of Sunderland local government area, which is the area which formally holds city status.}} in [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]]. It is a port at the mouth of the [[River Wear]] on the [[North Sea]], approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} south-east of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. The built-up area had a population of 168,277 at the 2021 census, making it the second largest settlement in North East England after Newcastle. It is the administrative centre of the [[metropolitan borough]] of [[City of Sunderland|the same name]].

Sunderland was once known as 'the largest shipbuilding town in the world' and once made a quarter of all of the world's ships from its famous yards, which date back to 1346 on the River Wear.

The centre of the modern city is an amalgamation of three settlements founded in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon era]]: [[Monkwearmouth]], on the north bank of the Wear, and Sunderland and [[Bishopwearmouth]] on the south bank. Monkwearmouth contains [[St Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth|St Peter's Church]], which was founded in 674 and formed part of [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey]], a significant centre of learning in the seventh and eighth centuries. Sunderland was a fishing settlement and later a port, being granted a town charter in 1179. The city traded in [[coal]] and [[salt]], also developing shipbuilding industry in the fourteenth century and glassmaking industry in the seventeenth century. Following the decline of its traditional industries in the late 20th century, the area became an [[automotive industry in the United Kingdom|automotive building centre]]. In 1992, the borough of Sunderland was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. Sunderland is historically part of [[County Durham]], being incorporated  to the ceremonial county of Tyne and Wear in 1974.

Locals are sometimes known as [[Mackems]], a term which came into common use in the 1970s. Its use and acceptance by residents, particularly among the older generations, is not universal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/SunderlandMackems.html|title=Sunderland Mackem Origin|access-date=19 August 2017|publisher=englandsnortheast.co.uk|year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wp.sunderland.ac.uk/seagullcity/mackem/|title=Mackem|access-date=19 August 2017|publisher=Seagull City|year=2017}}</ref> The term is also applied to the Sunderland dialect, which shares similarities with the other North East England dialects.

==Toponymy==
In {{circa|674}}, [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|King Ecgfrith]] granted [[Benedict Biscop]] a "sunder-land". In 685 [[Bede|The Venerable Bede]] moved to the newly founded [[Jarrow]] monastery. He had started his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery and later wrote that he was "ácenned on ''sundorlande'' þæs ylcan mynstres" (born in a ''separate land'' of this same monastery). This can be taken as "sundorlande" (being Old English for "separate land") or the settlement of Sunderland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/058721|title=Sundor-land (supplementary)|last=Bosworth|first=Joseph|author-link=Joseph Bosworth|editor-last=Toller|editor-first=Thomas Northcote|editor-link=Thomas Northcote Toller|editor2-last=Christ|editor2-first=Sean|editor3-last=Tichý|editor3-first=Ondřej|publisher=Faculty of Arts, [[Charles University in Prague]]|date=21 March 2010|website=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] Online.|access-date=22 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/029360|title=Sundor-land|last=Bosworth|first=Joseph|author-link=Joseph Bosworth|editor-last=Toller|editor-first=Thomas Northcote|editor-link=Thomas Northcote Toller|editor2-last=Christ|editor2-first=Sean|editor3-last=Tichý|editor3-first=Ondřej|publisher=Faculty of Arts, [[Charles University in Prague]]|date=21 March 2010|website=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] Online.|access-date=22 December 2018}}</ref> The name may also be descriptive of the original settlement's location, being almost cut off (sundered) from the rest of the mainland by creeks and gullies from both the sea and the River Wear.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Garbutt |first1=George |title=A Historical and Descriptive View of the Parishes of Monkwearmouth and Bishopwearmouth and the Port and Borough of Sunderland |date=1819 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhwwAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA118 |access-date=3 April 2024}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Sunderland}}

===Early, ancient and Medieval===
{{see also|Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey}}
The earliest [[inhabitants]] of the Sunderland area were [[Stone Age]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s and artifacts from this era have been discovered, including [[microliths]] found during excavations at [[St Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Sunderland |edition=2nd |year=2001 |isbn=0-9525122-6-2 |author=Glen Lyndon Dodds |page=5|publisher=Albion }}</ref> During the final phase of the Stone Age, the [[Neolithic period]] ({{circa|4000|2000}} BC), [[Hastings Hill]], on the western outskirts of Sunderland, was a focal point of activity and a place of burial and ritual significance. Evidence includes the former presence of a [[cursus]] monument.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Sunderland |edition=2nd |year=2001 |isbn=0-9525122-6-2 |author=Glen Lyndon Dodds |page=6|publisher=Albion }}</ref>

It is believed the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]]-speaking [[Brigantes]] inhabited the area around the [[River Wear]] in pre-[[Roman Britain]]. There is a long-standing local legend that there was a Roman settlement on the south bank of the River Wear on what is the site of the former Vaux Brewery, although no archaeological investigation has taken place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/3200659.stm|title=Brewery may hold Roman answers|access-date=22 July 2009 |work=BBC News|date=2 September 2003}}</ref>

Roman artefacts have been recovered in the River Wear at [[North Hylton]], including four stone anchors, which may support the theory that there was a Roman dam or port on the River Wear.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-56468718|title=Stone anchors found in River Wear could reveal Roman port|access-date=20 March 2020|work=BBC News|date=21 March 2021}}</ref>

Recorded settlements at the mouth of the Wear date to {{circa|674}}, when an [[Anglo-Saxon]] nobleman, Benedict Biscop, was granted land by King Ecgfrith, founded the Wearmouth–Jarrow (''St Peter's'') [[monastery]] on the north bank of the river—an area that became known as Monkwearmouth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Garbutt |first1=George |title=A Historical and Descriptive View of the Parishes of Monkwearmouth and Bishopwearmouth and the Port and Borough of Sunderland |date=1819 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhwwAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA39 |access-date=3 April 2024}}</ref> Biscop's monastery was the first built of stone in [[Northumbria]].

In the late 8th century the [[Vikings]] raided the coast, and by the middle of the 9th century the monastery had been abandoned. Lands on the south side of the river were granted to the [[Bishop of Durham]] by [[Athelstan|Athelstan of England]] in 930; these became known as Bishopwearmouth and included settlements such as [[Ryhope]] which fall within the modern boundary of Sunderland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/implementation/conservation/conservationwalks/bishopwearmouth/bishop.origins.asp |title=Origins of Bishopwearmouth |access-date=23 January 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201702/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/implementation/conservation/conservationwalks/bishopwearmouth/bishop.origins.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 27 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wearsideonline.com/ryhope_village.html|title=Ryhope Village|access-date=3 April 2008|publisher=Wearsideonline website|year=2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316021942/http://www.wearsideonline.com/ryhope_village.html|archive-date=16 March 2008}}</ref>

===Jamies and Black Cats===
Rapid growth of the port was prompted by the salt trade.<ref name="Pevsner1983" /> Salt exports from Sunderland are recorded from as early as the 13th century, by 1589 [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] were laid at Bishopwearmouth Panns (the modern-day name of the area the pans occupied is Pann's Bank, on the river bank between the city centre and the East End).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/sunderland.html|title=A Brief History of Sunderland|access-date=3 April 2008 |author=Tim Lambert|year=2008}}</ref> Large vats of [[seawater]] were heated using coal; as the water evaporated, the salt remained. As coal was required to heat the salt pans, a [[coal mining]] community began to emerge. Only poor-quality coal was used in salt panning; better-quality coal was traded via the port, which subsequently began to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northeasthistory.co.uk/the_north_east/history/coal/1100_1500/index.html |title=North East History, Early Coal Mining |access-date=3 April 2008 |work=The Northern Echo |year=2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173408/http://www.northeasthistory.co.uk/the_north_east/history/coal/1100_1500/index.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

Both salt and coal continued to be exported through the 17th century, with the coal trade growing significantly (2–3,000 tons of coal were exported from Sunderland in the year 1600; by 1680 this had increased to 180,000 tons).<ref name="Pevsner1983" /> Difficulty for colliers trying to navigate the Wear’s shallow waters meant coal mined further inland was loaded onto [[Keelboat|keels]] (large, flat-bottomed boats) and taken downriver to the waiting colliers.

Before the [[English Civil War|civil war]] and with the exception of [[Kingston upon Hull]], the North declared for the King. In 1644 the North was captured by the Roundheads (Parliamentarians), the area itself taken in March of that year. One artefact of the civil war in the area was the long trench; a tactic of later warfare. In the village of [[Offerton, Tyne and Wear|Offerton]] roughly three miles inland from the present city centre, skirmishes occurred. The Roundheads blockaded the [[River Tyne]], crippling the Newcastle coal trade, which allowed a short period of flourishing coal trade on the Wear.<ref name=civilwar>{{cite web | last = History.com Staff | title = English civil wars | website = history.com | publisher = A+E Networks | year = 2009 | url = http://www.history.com/topics/british-history/english-civil-wars | access-date = 29 July 2015 }}</ref><ref name="civWar1644">{{cite book | last = Dodds | first = Derek | title = Northumbia… (Battlefield Britain) | publisher = Leo Cooper Ltd (20 Oct 2005) | date = 20 October 2005 | location = England | page = 139 | isbn = 1844151492}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=''A History of Sunderland'' (second edition, 2001), Glen Lyndon Dodds, pp. 46–48}}</ref><ref name=tren>{{cite web | title = Offerton, site of Civil War skirmish – Details| website = twsitelines.info| date = 14 October 2015| url = http://www.twsitelines.info/SMR/25| access-date = 19 August 2016 }}</ref>

In 1669, after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted [[letters patent]] to one Edward Andrew, [[Esq.]] to 'build a pier and erect a lighthouse or lighthouses and cleanse the harbour of Sunderland'.

The [[Durham & Sunderland Railway]] Co. built a railway line across the Town Moor and established a passenger terminus there in 1836. In 1847 the line was bought by [[George Hudson]]'s [[York and Newcastle Railway]]. Hudson, nicknamed 'The Railway King', was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Sunderland (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland]] and was already involved in a scheme to build a dock in the area. In 1846 he had formed the [[Sunderland Docks|Sunderland Dock Company]], which received parliamentary approval for the construction of a dock between the South Pier and Hendon Bay.<ref name="SundEcho16.3.17">{{cite web |title=On the waterfront: First sea link with the docks |url=https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/on-the-waterfront-first-sea-link-with-the-docks-357798 |website=Sunderland Echo |date=16 March 2017 |access-date=31 August 2019}}</ref>

Increasing industrialisation had prompted residential expansion away from the old port area in the suburban terraces of the Fawcett Estate and [[Mowbray Park]]. The area around Fawcett Street itself increasingly functioned as the civic and commercial town centre.

Marine engineering works were established from the 1820s onwards, initially providing engines for [[paddle steamers]]; in 1845 a ship named ''Experiment'' was the first of many to be converted to [[screw steamer|steam screw propulsion]].<ref name="JAMarr" /> Demand for steam-powered vessels increased during the [[Crimean War]]; nonetheless, sailing ships continued to be built, including fast [[fully-rigged]] [[composite ship|composite]]-built [[clipper]]s, including the [[City of Adelaide (1864)|''City of Adelaide'']] in 1864 and [[Torrens (clipper ship)|''Torrens'']] (the last such vessel ever built), in 1875.<ref name="ShipbuildingFS2" />

By the middle of the century glassmaking was at its height on Wearside. [[Hartley Wood and Co|James Hartley & Co.]], established in Sunderland in 1836, grew to be the largest glassworks in the country and (having patented an innovative production technique for [[rolled plate glass]]) produced much of the glass used in the construction of [[the Crystal Palace]] in 1851.<ref name="SundIndust">{{cite web |title=Sunderland Industries |url=https://englandsnortheast.co.uk/sunderland-industries/ |website=England's North East |access-date=5 September 2019}}</ref> A third of all UK-manufactured plate glass was produced at Hartley's by this time.<ref name="JohnsonPotts2013" /> Other manufacturers included the Cornhill Flint Glassworks (established at Southwick in 1865), which went on to specialise in [[pressed glass]], as did the Wear Flint Glassworks (which had originally been established in 1697).<ref name="BBCGlassmaking" /> In addition to the plate glass and pressed glass manufacturers there were 16 bottle works on the Wear in the 1850s, with the capacity to produce between 60 and 70,000 bottles a day.<ref name="SundIndust" />

In 1848 George Hudson's [[York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway]] built a passenger terminus, [[Monkwearmouth Station Museum|Monkwearmouth Station]], just north of Wearmouth Bridge; and south of the river another passenger terminus, in Fawcett Street, in 1853. Later, [[Thomas Elliot Harrison]] (chief engineer to the [[North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)|North Eastern Railway]]) made plans to carry the railway across the river; the [[Wearmouth Railway Bridge]] (reputedly 'the largest Hog-Back iron girder bridge in the world') opened in 1879.<ref name="JohnsonPotts2013" />

===Administrative history===
The original settlement of Sunderland was historically part of the [[ancient parish]] of Bishopwearmouth in County Durham. It was an [[ancient borough]], having been granted a charter in 1179 under the name of 'Wearmouth'.<ref name=Simpson1999/> The original borough covered a relatively small area in the north-east corner of the old Bishopwearmouth parish, lying on the south side of the mouth of the River Wear. The borough was granted a further charter in 1634 which gave it the right to appoint a mayor and incorporated the town under the name of Sunderland rather than Wearmouth.<ref name=Morton1634/><ref name=commissioners>{{cite book |title=Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Municipal Corporations in England and Wales: Appendix 3 |date=1835 |page=1734 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3FTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1734 |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref> The area of the borough was made a separate parish from Bishopwearmouth by an act of parliament in 1719.<ref name=1719act>{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Henry D. |title=The Law Journal Reports |date=1859 |page=234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RMtAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA234 |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref>

The ancient borough's powers were relatively modest. Unlike most such boroughs, it did not hold its own courts, nor did it have any meaningful municipal functions.<ref name=commissioners/> A separate body of [[improvement commissioners]] was established in 1810 with responsibilities to pave, light and clean the streets, provide a [[watchman (law enforcement)|watch]], and improve the market.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sunderland Improvement, Market and River Wear Watch Act 1810 |url=https://vlex.co.uk/vid/sunderland-improvement-market-and-808199881 |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref> In 1832 a [[parliamentary borough]] (constitutency) of [[Sunderland (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland]] was created, covering the parishes or townships of Sunderland, Bishopwearmouth, Bishopwearmouth Panns, Monkwearmouth, Monkwearmouth Shore and Southwick.<ref>{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Boundaries Act |date=1832 |page=343 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq0uAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA343 |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref>

In 1836 Sunderland was reformed to become a [[municipal borough]] under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.<ref>{{cite book |title=Municipal Corporations Act |date=1835 |page=458 |url=https://archive.org/details/statutesunitedk35britgoog/page/458/mode/2up |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref> The municipal boundaries were enlarged at the same time to match the constituency, although later that year the municipal boundaries were reduced to remove Southwick and the parts of Bishopwearmouth and Bishopwearmouth Panns which fell more than one mile from the centre of Wearmouth Bridge.<ref>{{cite book |title=An Act to make temporary provision for the boundaries of certain boroughs |date=1836 |page=1146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqoNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1146 |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref> The improvement commissioners were wound up in 1851 and their functions transferred to the council.<ref name=1867act/>

When elected county councils were established in 1889, Sunderland was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a [[county borough]], independent from the new [[Durham County Council]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1888|year=1888|chapter=41}}</ref> The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1867,<ref name=1867act>{{cite web |title=Sunderland Extension and Improvement Act 1867 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/30-31/117/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref> 1928 (when it gained areas including [[Fulwell, Sunderland|Fulwell]], [[Southwick, Sunderland|Southwick]] and the remainder of the old Bishopwearmouth parish), 1936, 1951, and 1967 (when it gained [[North Hylton]], [[South Hylton]], [[Ryhope]], [[Silksworth]], and [[Tunstall, Sunderland|Tunstall]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Sunderland Municipal Borough / County Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10136830#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref>

In 1974 the county borough was replaced by a larger metropolitan borough within the new county of Tyne and Wear. The borough gained [[Hetton-le-Hole]], [[Houghton-le-Spring]], [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], [[Burdon]], and [[Warden Law]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1972|year=1972|chapter=70|schedule=1|access-date=25 March 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Metropolitan Districts (Names) Order 1973|year=1973|number=137}}</ref>

From 1974 until 1986 the borough council was a lower-tier district authority, with [[Tyne and Wear County Council]] providing county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1986, with the borough council taking on county-level functions. Some functions are provided across Tyne and Wear by joint committees with the other districts. The county of Tyne and Wear continues to exist as a [[ceremonial county]] for the purposes of lieutenancy, but has had no administrative functions since 1986.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1985|year=1985|chapter=51|access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref> The borough of Sunderland was awarded city status in 1992.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52874|page=5413|date=26 March 1992}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{wide image|Sunderland panoramic riverside.jpg|1200px|Sunderland riverside at sunset}}
{{See also|List of places in Sunderland}}
[[File:Wearmouth Bridge, Sunderland.jpg|thumb|right|The Wearmouth Bridge (right) and railway bridge (left). This road was the route of the old A19, now it is the A1018.]]
Much of the city is located on a low range of hills running parallel to the coast. On average, it is around 80 metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Sunderland is divided by the River Wear which passes through the middle of the city in a deeply incised valley, part of which is known as the Hylton gorge. Several smaller bodies of water, such as [[Hendon Burn]] and the Barnes Burn, run through the suburbs. The three road bridges connecting the north and south portions of the city are the [[Queen Alexandra Bridge]] at Pallion, the [[Wearmouth Bridge]] just to the north of the city centre and most recently the [[Northern Spire Bridge]] between Castletown and Pallion. To the west of the city, the [[Hylton Viaduct]] carries the [[A19 road|A19]] dual-carriageway over the Wear (see map below).

The city has a number of public parks. Several of these are historic, including [[Mowbray Park]], [[Roker Park (park)|Roker Park]] and [[Barnes Park]]. In the early 2000s, [[Herrington Country Park]] was opened opposite [[Penshaw Monument]]. The city's parks have secured several awards for its commitment to preserving natural facilities, receiving the [[Britain in Bloom]] collective in 1993, 1997 and 2000.

Approximately 70% of the population of the built-up area lives on the south side of the river and 30% on the north side. The built-up area extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope in the south and [[Seaburn]] in the north.

===Green belt===
{{main|North East Green Belt}}
The built-up area is surrounded by the Tyne and Wear Green Belt,<ref name="sunderland-belt">{{cite web|title=GREEN BELT REVIEW STAGE 1 – CORE STRATEGY GROWTH OPTIONS STAGE, MARCH 2016 |url=https://www.sunderland.gov.uk/media/18571/SD43-Sunderland-Green-Belt-Review-Stage-1-Core-Strategy-Growth-Options-Stge-March-2016-/pdf/SD43_Sunderland_Green_Belt_Review_Stage_1_-_Core_Strategy_Growth_Options_Stage_March_2016.pdf|website=www.sunderland.gov.uk}}</ref> with its portion in much of its surrounding rural area of the borough. It is a part of the local [[development plan]], of which its stated aims<ref name="sunderland-belt"/> are as follows:

{{blockquote|A Green Belt will be maintained which will:-

(i) Check the unrestricted sprawl of the built up area of Sunderland;<br />
(ii) Assist in safeguarding the city's countryside from further encroachment;<br />
(iii) Assist in the regeneration of the urban area of the city;<br />
(iv) Preserve the setting and special character of Springwell Village;<br />
(iv) Prevent the merging of Sunderland with Tyneside, Washington, Houghton-le-Spring and Seaham, and the merging of Shiney Row with Washington, Chester-le-Street and Bournmoor.}}

In the Sunderland borough boundary, as well as the aforementioned areas, landscape features and facilities such as much of the River Don and Wear basins, the George Washington Hotel Golf and Spa complex, Sharpley Golf Course, Herrington Country Park, Houghton Quarry and Penshaw Hill are within the green belt area.

===Climate===
Sunderland has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''). Its location in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Pennines]], as well as other mountain ranges to the west, such as those of the [[Lake District]] and southwestern Scotland, make Sunderland one of the least rainy cities of Northern England. The climate is heavily moderated by the adjacent [[North Sea]], giving it cool summers, and winters that are mild considering its latitude.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} The closest weather station is in [[Tynemouth]], about {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of Sunderland. As a result, Sunderland's coastline is likely slightly milder given the more southerly position. Another relatively nearby weather station in [[Durham, England#Climate|Durham]] has warmer summer days and colder winter nights courtesy of its inland position.

The majority of the [[BAME]] population live in Sunderland East – more specifically Hendon and Millfield where there is a larger population of Bangladeshi/Bangladeshi British and Indian/Indian British than elsewhere. There is also a significant Chinese population in these areas. Sunderland West has a population of Indian, Pakistani and other Asian ethnicities. Sunderland North has a substantial Chinese population, notably in St.Peter’s. This is believed to be influenced by the student
population in which:
* 147 nationalities are represented
* 51.27% students are White, 13.92% Asian, 12.78% Asian Other and 5.12% Black African, with other ethnicities in much smaller numbers

While BAME populations are more concentrated in some areas within Sunderland, ethnic diversity is too low in the city to determine if any groups are particularly segregated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Inequalities and Integration |url=https://www.sunderland.gov.uk/media/21082/Understanding-inequalities-and-integration/pdf/Understanding_inequalities_and_integration.pdf?m=1547214630037 |website=Sunderland Council |access-date=30 December 2023}}</ref>

The Stake Center for the Sunderland Stake of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] is in Sunderland.

Jewish heritage in the city, once part of a thriving community, can be dated back to around 1750, when a number of Jewish merchants from across the UK and Europe settled in Sunderland,<ref name=":1" /> eventually forming a congregation in 1768. A [[rabbi]] from [[Holland]] was established in the city in 1790. After a rapid growth in numbers during the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Jewish community in Sunderland reached its height in the mid 1930s, when around 2,000 Jews were recorded to be living in the town.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.seligman.org.il/sunderland_jews.html|title=Sunderland Jews|last=Seligman|first=Jon|website=www.seligman.org.il|access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref> The community has been in slow decline since the mid-20th century.

In 1998, following the grant of city status to Sunderland, the erstwhile [[parish church]] of Bishopwearmouth (St Michael's) was redesignated as [[Sunderland Minster]] with a city-wide role. It was believed to have been the first creation of a [[Minster (church)|minster church]] in England since the [[Reformation in England|Reformation]].<ref name="JohnsonPotts2013" />

====Pentecostalism====
The Reverend [[Alexander Boddy]] (1854–1930) was appointed vicar of [[All Saints' Church, Monkwearmouth]] in 1884. During his ministry at Monkwearmouth, Boddy was influenced by the [[1904–1905 Welsh revival]] and also by the British-born Norwegian preacher [[Thomas Ball Barratt]]. In the early years of the 20th century All Saints, Monkwearmouth became an important centre for the development of the Pentecostal Movement in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anglicannews.org/news/2014/04/historic-anglican,-pentecostal-consultation-a-flying-start.aspx |title=Historic Anglican, Pentecostal consultation "a flying start" |publisher=Anglicannews.org |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2022-02-27}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{Further|List of companies in the City of Sunderland}}
Following the industrial decline of the 1970s to early 1980s and collapse of the local shipbuilding industry, Sunderland's mid-1980s economic situation began to improve. Japanese car manufacturer [[Nissan]] opened the [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK]] factory in 1986, and the first [[Nissan Bluebird]] car was produced later that year.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> The factory and its supplier companies remain the largest employers in the region, with current cars produced there including the [[Nissan Qashqai]], the [[Nissan Juke]] and the electric [[Nissan Leaf|Nissan LEAF]]. As of 2012 over 500,000 cars are produced annually, and it is the UK's largest car factory.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/>

Also in the late 1980s, new [[Service industry|service industries]] moved into sites such as the [[Doxford International Business Park]] in the south west of the city, attracting national and international companies. Sunderland was named in the shortlist of the top seven "intelligent cities" in the world for the use of [[information technology]], in 2004 and 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Pages/press/pritem.asp?Id=1021 |title=Top of the World |publisher=Sunderland City Council |date=20 January 2005 |access-date=9 December 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312062944/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Pages/press/pritem.asp?Id=1021 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 12 March 2007}}</ref>

===Regeneration===
Since the mid-1980s Sunderland has undergone massive regeneration,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} particularly around the [[Sunderland City Centre|City Centre]] and the river corridor.

In 2000, [[the Bridges]] [[shopping mall|shopping centre]] was extended towards Crowtree Road and the former Central [[Bus station|Bus Station]], attracting national [[chain store]]s. This was followed by adjacent redevelopments on Park Lane.

The former shipyards along the Wear were transformed with a mixture of residential, commercial and leisure facilities including St Peter's Campus of the University of Sunderland, University accommodation along the Fish Quay on the South side of the river, the North Haven housing and marina development, the [[National Glass Centre]], the [[Stadium of Light]] and Hylton Riverside Retail Park. Also in 2007, the Echo 24 luxury apartments opened on Pann's Bank overlooking the river. 

Sunderland Corporation's massive post-war housing estate developments at [[Farringdon, Sunderland|Farringdon]], [[Pennywell]] and [[Grindon, Sunderland|Grindon]] have all passed into the ownership of Gentoo Group (previously 'Sunderland Housing Group'), a private company and a [[Registered Social Landlord]].

The Port of Sunderland, owned by the city council, has been allocated for medium-term redevelopment with a focus on mixed-use industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/portofsunderland/ |title=Port of Sunderland |date=1 January 2006 |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227122242/http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/portofsunderland/ |archive-date=27 February 2009 }}</ref>

Sunderland City Council's Unitary Development Plan (UDP) outlines a number of sites around the city for regeneration.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/planningandenvironment/planningpolicy/udp/udp/udphome-page.asp |title=Sunderland Unitary Development Plan |date=6 January 2009 |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330043523/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/Environment/PlanningandEnvironment/PlanningPolicy/UDP/UDP/udphome-page.asp |archive-date=30 March 2009 }}</ref> The plans are supported by [[Sunderland Arc]], an urban regeneration company funded by the City council, [[One NorthEast]] (defunct) and the [[Homes and Communities Agency]].

In 2004, redevelopment work began in the Sunniside area in the east-end of the city centre, including a [[multiplex cinema]], a [[multi-storey car park]], restaurants, a [[casino]] and [[tenpin bowling]]. Originally the River Quarter, the site was renamed Limelight in 2005, and renamed in 2008, when it became Sunniside Leisure. Sunniside Gardens were landscaped, and a number of new cafes, bars and restaurants were opened. Up-market residential apartments were developed, including the Echo 24 building.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/sunniside/ |title=Sunniside |publisher=[[Sunderland arc]]|date=6 January 2009 |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226232909/http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/sunniside/ |archive-date=26 February 2009 }}</ref>

;Stadium Village

[[Sunderland A.F.C.]] has been a major symbol of the area and a contributor to the local economy since the late 19th century. The club was one of the most successful and best supported clubs in the English game during this era, with its home at [[Roker Park]] holding more than 70,000 spectators at its peak. However, the [[FA Cup]] triumph of 1973 would prove to be the club's only postwar major trophy to date, and after its relegation in 1958 the club frequently bounced between the top two divisions of English football, and in 1987 and again in 2018 suffered relegation to the third tier of English football. The club played at Roker Park for 99 years until the completion of the new [[Stadium of Light]] at [[Monkwearmouth]] on the banks of the [[River Wear]] in 1997. The new stadium seated more than 42,000 on its completion, and has since been expanded to hold some 49,000 spectators. Sunderland's relatively high attendances have been a major boost to the local economy – averaging at more than 30,000 even during the club's most recent spell in the third tier of English football.

Redevelopment of the Monkwearmouth Colliery site, which sits on the north bank of the river Wear opposite the Vaux site, began in the mid-1990s with the creation of the [[Stadium of Light]]. In 2008 the [[Sunderland Aquatic Centre]] opened adjacent to the Stadium of Light, containing the only [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] between [[Leeds]] and [[Edinburgh]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}  The Sheepfolds industrial estate occupies a large area of land between the Stadium and the [[Wearmouth Bridge]]. [[Sunderland Arc]] were in the process of purchasing land in the Sheepfolds, with a view to relocate the businesses and redevelop the site. The emphasis of development plans included further sporting facilities, in order to create a ''Sports Village''. Other plans included a hotel, residential accommodation, and a [[footbridge]] linking the site with the Vaux development.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/stadiumVillage/sheepfolds/index.aspx |title=Stadium Park Development |date=1 January 2006 |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025004930/http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/stadiumVillage/sheepfolds/index.aspx |archive-date=25 October 2007 }}</ref>

;Grove and Transport Corridor
The Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor (SSTC) is a proposed transport link from the A19, through the city centre, to the port. A major phase of the plan was the creation of a new bridge, the [[Northern Spire Bridge]], which links the [[A1231 road|A1231]] Wessington Way on the north of the river with the Grove site in Pallion, on the south of the river. In 2008, Sunderland City Council offered the residents of Sunderland the opportunity to vote on the design of the bridge. The choices were a {{Convert|180|m|ft|-1|adj=on}} iconic [[cable-stayed bridge]], which would result in a temporary increase in [[council tax]], or a simple [[road bridge|box structure]] which would be within the council's budget.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/newbridge/ |title=New Bridge |date=10 March 2008 |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118050641/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/newbridge/ |archive-date=18 November 2009 }}</ref> The results of the consultation were inconclusive, with residents keen to have an iconic bridge, but reluctant to have a subsequent increase in tax to fund it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Next-step-in-road-to.4747133.jp |title=Next step in road to iconic Wear bridge|date=1 December 2008 |access-date=10 March 2009}}</ref> Regardless of the ultimate design of the new bridge, the landing point will be the former Grove Cranes site in [[Pallion]].

Sunderland, part of the Durham coalfield, has a coal-mining heritage that dates back centuries.

However, there has been a modest rejuvenation with the opening of the [[National Glass Centre]] which, amongst other things, provides international glass makers with working facilities and a shop to showcase their work, predominantly in the artistic rather than functional field.

In 1855, [[John Candlish]] opened a bottleworks, producing glass bottles, with 6 sites at nearby [[Seaham]] and at Diamond Hall, Sunderland.

[[Vaux Breweries]] was established in the town centre in the 1880s and for 110 years was a major employer.

*The [[A1018 road|A1018]] and [[A183 road (England)|A183]] roads both start in the centre of South Shields and enter Sunderland from the north, before merging to cross the Wearmouth Bridge. The A1018 follows a direct route from Shields to Sunderland, the A183 follows the coast. After crossing the bridge, the A1018 follows a relatively straight path to the south of Sunderland where it merges with the A19. The A183 becomes ''Chester Road'' and heads west out of the city to the A1 at [[Chester-le-Street]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In Autumn 2007, the ''Southern Radial Route'' was opened. This is a bypass of the A1018 through Grangetown and Ryhope – a stretch that commonly suffered from [[traffic congestion|congestion]], especially during [[rush hour]]. The bypass starts just south of Ryhope and runs parallel to the cliff tops into Hendon, largely avoiding residential areas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The Sunderland strategic transport corridor project is an ongoing investment to the city's road infrastructure. The scheme improves transport links around the city, ensuring continuous dual carriageway between the A19 road and the port of Sunderland, as well as the [[Northern Spire]] bridge built over the Wear between Pallion (south) and Castletown (north).

{{Main|Mackem}}
The dialect of Sunderland is known as [[Mackem]], and contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive words and pronunciations not used in other parts of the United Kingdom.

A few Sunderland dialect words:
*Nee – No
*Bosh – Problem
*Marra – Mate
*Ha'way – Come on (Not to be confused with Geordie's Howay)
*Knack – Hurt
*Git – Very (Used to emphasize something so 'very good' becomes 'git good')
*Claes – Clothes
