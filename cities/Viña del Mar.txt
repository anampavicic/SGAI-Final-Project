'''Viña del Mar''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbiɲa ðel ˈmaɾ}}; meaning "Vineyard of the Sea") is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] on [[Zona Central, Chile|central Chile]]'s Pacific coast. Often referred to as {{lang|es|La Ciudad Jardín}} ("The Garden City"), Viña del Mar is located within the [[Valparaíso Region]], and it is [[List of cities in Chile#Largest urban agglomerations|Chile's fourth largest city]] with a population of 324,836 (according to the 2008 census). Viña del Mar is also part of the [[Greater Valparaíso]] area, the country's second largest metropolitan area (pop. 935,602, 2017 census), after the Metropolitan area of [[Greater Santiago|Santiago]]. The Greater Valparaíso Area is home to five municipalities: [[Valparaíso]], Viña del Mar, [[Concon, Chile|Concon]], [[Quilpue]] and [[Villa Alemana]].<ref>[http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/demografia/pdf/cdpubaldcasjunio2005.zip Chile: Ciudades, Pueblos, Aldeas y Caseríos 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417104104/http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/demografia/pdf/cdpubaldcasjunio2005.zip |date=17 April 2012 }}, Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas – June 2005.</ref>

==History==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Viña Del Mar Clock.jpg|thumbnail|View from [[floral clock|Flower Clock]], one of the main tourist landmarks of the city]]
The valley where Viña del Mar was founded was known as the valley of Peuco by the [[Chango people|Changos]], native inhabitants of the area dedicated to fishing. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} With the arrival of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es the valley was divided into two large [[hacienda]]s. North of the Marga Marga creek up to the current location of Reñaca, Viña del Mar, and to the south up to the current Cerro Barón (Baron Hill), the Hacienda Las Siete Hermanas (The Seven Sisters).

[[Francisco Javier Alvares]] authorized the construction of a railroad through his lands to join Santiago and the port of Valparaíso. The arrival of the railroad brought a young engineer Jose Francisco Vergara who married Francisco Javier Alvares's granddaughter, Mercedes Alvares. It was José Francisco Vergara who instigated the idea of the creation of a new city independent of Valparaíso. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Arrival of the railroad and founding ===
[[File:Castillo Wulff1.JPG|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Wulff Castle]]]]
[[File:Viña del Mar Santander.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|High-rise buildings by the shore]]

The establishment of Refinadora de Azúcar de Viña del Mar (Sugar Refining Company), CRAV in 1873 and the foundation of the [[:es:Lever, Murphy %26 Co.|Lever, Murphy & Co.]] by the British Richard Lever and William Murphy in 1883, that gave the necessary economic impulse to transform the young city into one of the most important cities of Chile. The building of a military installation, Regimiento Coraceros in 1917, naval facilities in Las Salinas, and the housing of military and naval personnel furthered the city's growth. That year, also, a seaside villa was rebuilt as what is known today as [[Wulff Castle]].<ref>http://www.patrimoniovina.cl/index.php?ir=pags/det_nuestracasa.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831205541/http://www.patrimoniovina.cl/index.php?ir=pags/det_nuestracasa.php |date=31 August 2009 }} paragraphs under Historia. Spanish only</ref>

In 1925, the Teatro Municipal was opened in its current location in the eastern front of the city's downtown square, Plaza de Viña del Mar. In 1928 president [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] authorized the creation of a casino, securing the future and the touristy character of the city. The Casino Municipal de Viña del Mar was opened on December 31, 1930.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crónicas históricas de Viña del Mar: Memorias de una Ciudad Joven|last1=Hurtado|first1=Julio|last2=Larreta|first2=Alfredo|publisher=RIL editores|year=2013|isbn=978-956-284-985-2|location=Santiago de Chile|pages=150}}</ref>  On January 31, 1931, [[Palace of Cerro Castillo|the Presidential Palace was inaugurated in Cerro Castillo (Castle Hill)]] as a summer residence for the Chilean President. The touristy character of the city was furthered with the inauguration of the O'Higgins Hotel in 1936 and the inauguration of the Miramar Hotel by Caleta Abarca Beach in 1945.  For a few years in the early 1960s, a [[Trolleybuses in Valparaíso|trolleybus line]] connected the city with Valparaíso, and the electric route network included three branches within Viña.<ref name=morr-hist1>[http://www.tramz.com/cl/v/vae.html The Trolleybuses of Valparaíso, Chile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412085143/http://www.tramz.com/cl/v/vae.html |date=12 April 2019 }} (detailed history). Allen Morrison. 2006. Retrieved 2011-03-14.</ref>

Viña del Mar was one of the four host cities of the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 football (soccer) World Cup]].  It is now home to [[Corporación Deportiva Everton de Viña del Mar|CD Everton]], a soccer team in the Chilean Premier division, which took its name from the [[Everton F.C.|English team]].

According to the 1982 movie, [[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]] and other sources, Vina Del Mar was focal point for the plotters of the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/ap/december/352534/Wife:-US-official-accused-in-Chile-has-Alzheimers|title=www.cfnews13.com|website=cfnews13.com}}</ref>

Viña del Mar was declared a [[sister city]] of [[Sausalito, California]] (a city north of San Francisco), in 1971. To demonstrate the sister city relationship, you can find a square (plaza) called "Viña del Mar" in downtown Sausalito, and a "Sausalito" stadium and "Sausalito" lagoon in Viña del Mar. Viña del Mar is also a sister city of [[Mar del Plata, Argentina]] since 1993. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

During the 1980s, a global economic downturn seriously affected the city, a number of small and medium-sized factories went bankrupt, including the stationery manufacturer Coda, and most importantly, CRAV, and Textiles Viña, two of the biggest employers in the city. [[Unemployment]] rose to alarmingly high rates. Many factories started to consolidate their operations in Santiago making the situation even worse. The city has failed to fully recover from the blows inflicted by the economic downturn of 1982, but an increase in the number of international tourists visiting the city, and the recent high prices of copper in world markets have promoted an economic recovery. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Extensive commercial redevelopment in the 15 Norte Avenue area, previously an abandoned industrial area, has seen most of the large Chilean retail chains settling in the area, which is now covered with large shopping malls, like Marina Arauco, cinemas, fast food stores, and supermarkets.

The city has benefitted from major investments in infrastructure that have greatly improved the traffic flow in the downtown area,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} especially in routes connecting Viña del Mar with [[Santiago]], Valparaíso and [[Quilpué]]. A modern and efficient subway [[Valparaíso Metro]] connects Viña del Mar with the cities of [[Limache]] and Valparaíso, following the original railroad tracks between Valparaíso and Santiago.

The city was affected by the [[2010 Chile earthquake|February 27, 2010 earthquake]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Easy Voyage, [http://www.easyvoyage.com/infos-voyageur/le-chili-5-jours-apres-le-seisme-3451 "Le Chili 5 jours après le séisme"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725125650/http://www.easyvoyage.com/infos-voyageur/le-chili-5-jours-apres-le-seisme-3451 |date=25 July 2011 }}, ''March 4, 2010'' (accessed March 4, 2010)</ref>

==City landmarks==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}

Visitors and locals enjoy the parks and water fountains of the city, including a large flower clock (Reloj de Flores) with its numbers made up of flowering plants, near Caleta Abarca beach. The [[Valparaiso Sporting Club]] horse racing track is another major landmark. Jardín Botánico or Parque del Salitre, a large botanical garden on the outskirts of the city, was originally designed and built by an entrepreneur who became wealthy from exploiting [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] resources in northern Chile.

A few buildings from the 19th century still remain after multiple [[earthquake]]s that have destroyed most of the old areas of the city. Most of the older buildings that remain are located along Avenida Libertad (Liberty Avenue), Quillota Street and [[Quinta Vergara]], a large park in the middle of the city. The presidential summer residence, Palacio Presidencial (Presidential Palace) is located on Cerro Castillo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.patrimoniovina.cl/articulo/monumentos-historicos/8/15/palacio-presidencial.html|title=Palacio Presidencial - Patrimonio &#124; Sitio Patrimonial de Viña del Mar|access-date=20 May 2024|archive-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530020853/http://www.patrimoniovina.cl/articulo/monumentos-historicos/8/15/palacio-presidencial.html|url-status=live}}</ref> (Castle Hill).

The city's casino was designed in [[art deco]] style and is surrounded by well-tended gardens (hence the city's nickname). In 2004, a hotel (Hotel del Mar) was added to the 1931s building, resembling the architectural features of the original building.

Palacio Rioja, a mansion built by Fernando Rioja in 1907, located on Quillota Street, houses an environmental museum. The [[Fonck Museum]], located in Cuatro Norte Street, has a large exhibition of pre-Columbian articles, and a large [[moai]] ([[Easter Island]] statue made of volcanic rock), the only one in mainland Chile, is also on display. Palacio Carrasco, built by Emilio Carrasco in 1912, now houses the Municipal Library and also is used for arts exhibitions. The building is also surrounded by nice gardens adorned with fine sculptures including a Rodin. Palacio Vergara located in Quinta Vergara was built by Blanca Vergara (daughter of José Francisco) in 1906 and it is now owned by the municipality. It currently houses the School of Fine Arts and has produced important Chilean artists like the painter [[Giancarlo Bertini]].

[[Brunet Castle]] (also known as "Castillo Yarur") was built in 1923 by Adolfo Brunet on Cerro Castillo, close to the presidential mansion. Currently it is owned by [[Carabineros de Chile]] (Chilean police) and is used as a reception center for important visitors. It was declared a national monument in 2005.

Palacio Carrasco and its surrounding park, located on Liberty Avenue #250, between 3 and 4 Norte, was completed in 1923. For years it was a private residence until it moved to the Municipality of Viña del Mar. After moving it to its current location in Arlegui street, the Palacio Carrasco became a Library Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna, public library of the commune, while working as center for events, art exhibitions, and cultural workshops. It is very important to stress that the building is totally unsuitable for use as a public library and the community needs a new building for this purpose. Outside the entrance to the Palacio Carrasco there is a sculpture by Auguste Rodin called "La Defensa." It was declared a national historic monument on September 8, 1986 under Supreme Decree No. 791.

[[Castillo Wulff]], is an iconic building of the commune of neo-Tudor style, built in 1906. Strategically located in the coastal border between the mouth of Marga Marga and Caleta Abarca (Avenida Marina N° 37). It was built by Don Gustavo Wulff Mowle (1862–1946) a businessman and philanthropist of [[Valparaíso]]. The building was designed in two floors connected to a torreón through a medieval-style bridge. In 1995 it was declared a national monument, but today houses the offices of the headquarters of the Heritage Unit of the Municipality of Viña del Mar. It is also the location of the distinguished Castillo del Mar (Club Árabe, a seafood restaurant).

Numerous bars and restaurants have recently opened in the area around Plaza México and Avenida San Martín, offering Chilean and international cuisine. Seafood restaurants are located on the Camino Costero (Coast Roadway) that joins Viña del Mar and Concón, a coastal town to the north.

The Yacht Club de Chile is a [[yacht club]] located in Caleta Higuerillas. This club was established in Viña del Mar in 1955, though it is now part of the Concón municipality.

The [[VTR Open]] was a professional men's tennis tournament played yearly on outdoor red clay courts at the Club Naval de Campo Las Salinas.

The [[Viña del Mar International Film Festival]] is considered among the most important film festivals in Chile and Latin America. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Another important event is the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]], held at the amphitheater located in the [[Quinta Vergara]], one of the largest green areas of the city. The amphitheater of the Quinta Vergara was built in the 1960s. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

There is also the Palacio Vergara, home to Viña's fine arts museum.

The Municipal Theatre of Viña del Mar, located in front of Plaza de Viña, is a center of cultural and artistic events of first importance in Chile. In the neighboring block is also the traditional and elegant Club de Viña, with its classical facade.

The Museum of Naval Canons is an outdoor museum, located on the road Jorge Montt (connecting Viña del Mar with the beaches of Las Salinas and Reñaca), whose beach exhibits several pieces of artillery in front of the facilities of the [[Chilean Navy]].

The '''Fonk Museum'''  founded in 1937, is a varied and complete museum that shows objects from native villages from cultures such as [[Rapanui]], [[atacameños]], [[Diaguitas]] and [[Mapuches]], in addition to a wide collection of Peruvian pre-Columbian jars. In the area of natural sciences there is a sample of [[arthropods]] and animals of different zones of the country.

==Climate==

Viña del Mar has a warm-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] influenced on the coast by the [[Humboldt Current]]. As in any Mediterranean climate, the city experiences a dry, warm summer but temperatures rarely exceed {{convert|30|°C|F|abbr=on|lk=out}} due to the influence of the maritime current offshore. Summer nights are cool with temperatures around {{convert|16|°C|F|abbr=on|lk=out}}. Winters are damp and cool with daily high temperatures ranging from {{convert|13|to|17|C|F|abbr=on}} and from {{convert|5|to|9|C|F|abbr=on}} at night, rarely falling below freezing. Spring and autumn can vary from mild to cool. The rain falls mainly in autumn and winter, with July being the rainiest (107&nbsp;mm).  The average annual rainfall totals 480&nbsp;mm.
