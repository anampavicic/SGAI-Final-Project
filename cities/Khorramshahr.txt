Khorramshahr is an [[inland port]] city located approximately {{convert|10|km}} north of [[Abadan, Iran|Abadan]]. The city extends to the right bank of the [[Shatt Al Arab]] waterway near its confluence with the [[Haffar]] arm of the [[Karun]] river. The city was destroyed in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], with the 1986 census recording a population of zero. However, Khorramshahr was rebuilt after the war, and more recent censuses show that the population has returned to the pre-war level.

==History==
The area where the city exists today was originally under the waters of the [[Persian Gulf]]. It later became part of the vast marshlands and the tidal flats at the mouth of the [[Karun River]]. The small town known as ''Piyan'', and later ''Bayan'' appeared in the area no sooner than the late [[Parthia]]n time in the first century AD. Whether or not this was located at the same spot where Khurramshahr is today, is highly debatable.

During the Islamic centuries, the [[Daylamite]] [[Buwayhid]] king, Panah Khusraw [[Adud ad-Dawlah]] ordered the digging of a canal to join the Karun River (which at the time emptied independently into the Persian Gulf through the [[Bahmanshir]] channel) to the [[Shatt al-Arab]] (the joint estuary of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers, known in Iran as ''Arvand Rud''). The extra water made the joint estuary more reliably navigable. The channel thus created was known as the [[Haffar]], [[Arabic]] for "excavated," "dugout," which exactly described what the channel was. The Haffar soon became the main channel of the [[Karun]], as it is in the present day.

It was the capital of the [[Emirate of Muhammara|Sheikdom of Muhammara]], and until 1847, at which time it became Persian territory (according to Article II of the [[Treaty of Erzurum]]), Khorramshahr was alternately claimed and occupied by [[Iran|Persia]] and Turkey. Its [[Jabir Ibn Merdaw|ruler]] at the time was an Arab [[sheikh]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Muhamrah|volume=18|page=956}}</ref>

===Iran–Iraq War===
{{Main|Battle of Khorramshahr (1980)|Battle of Khorramshahr (1982)}}
Because of the war, the population of Khorramshahr dropped from 146,706 in the 1976 census to 0 in the 1986 census. The population reached 34,750 in the 1991 census and by the 2006 census it reached 123,866, and according to World Gazetteer its population as of 2012 is 138,398, making the population close to what it was before the war.<ref>{{IranCensus2006|06}}</ref>
