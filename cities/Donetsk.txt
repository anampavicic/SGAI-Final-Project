The population was estimated at {{Ua-pop-est2022|901645}} in the city core, with over 2 million in the [[metropolitan area]] (2011). According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]], Donetsk was the fifth-largest city in Ukraine.<ref name="ukrcensus1">{{cite web |title= Results / General results of the census / Number of cities |work= [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] |url= http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/city/ |access-date = 28 August 2006 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060109012020/http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/city/ |archive-date= 9 January 2006}}</ref>

Administratively, Donetsk has been the centre of Donetsk Oblast, while historically, it is the unofficial capital and largest city of the larger economic and cultural [[Donbas|Donets Basin]] (''Donbas'') region. Donetsk is adjacent to another major city, [[Makiivka]], and along with other surrounding cities forms a major [[urban sprawl]] and [[conurbation]] in the region. Donetsk has been a major economic, industrial and scientific centre of Ukraine with a high concentration of heavy industries and a skilled workforce. The density of heavy industries (predominantly steel production, chemical industry, and coal mining) determined the city's challenging ecological situation. In 2012, a UN report ranked Donetsk among the world's fastest depopulating cities.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-that-are-shrinking-2012-10?r=US&IR=T The 28 Fastest-Shrinking Cities In The World]</ref>

The original settlement in the south of the European part of the [[Russian Empire]] was first mentioned as Aleksandrovka in 1779, during the reign of the Empress [[Catherine the Great]]. In 1869, the Welsh businessman [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] founded a steel plant and several [[coal mining|coal mines]] in the region, and the town was named Hughesovka or Yuzovka (Юзовка) in recognition of his role ("Yuz" being a Russian-language approximation of ''Hughes''). During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the city's steel industry expanded. In 1924, Yuzovka was renamed Stalin. In 1929, Stalin was renamed Stalino, and in 1932, the city became the centre of the Donetsk region. Renamed Donetsk in 1961, the city today remains a centre for [[coal mining]] and for the [[steel industry]].

Since April 2014, Donetsk and its surrounding areas have been one of the major sites of fighting in the ongoing [[Russo-Ukrainian War]], as pro-Russian separatist forces battle against Ukrainian military forces for control of the city and surrounding areas. Throughout the war, the city of Donetsk has been administered by the pro-Russian separatist forces as the center of the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] (DPR), with outlying territories of the Donetsk region divided between the two sides.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Weaver |first1= Matthew |last2= Luhn |first2= Alec |date= 13 February 2015 |title= Ukraine ceasefire deal agreed at Minsk talks |work= The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-reports-emerge-of-agreement-in-minsk-talks |access-date= 16 December 2016}}</ref> [[Donetsk International Airport]] became the epicenter of the war in 2014 with almost a year-long battle.

== History ==

===Foundation===
One of the early mining settlements in the territory of Donetsk was {{ill|lt=Alexandrovka (Oleksandrivka)|Oleksandrivka, Donetsk|ru|Александровка (Донецк)|uk|Олександрівка (Донецьк)}}. The existence of Aleksandrovskaya (Oleksandrivska) Cossack ''[[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]]'' in its place is attested by 1779,<ref>[https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/donbass-realii/30148510.html "Дату основания Донецка нужно вести минимум с 1779 года – историк"], ''[[Radio Liberty]]'' {{in lang|ru}}</ref> with the {{ill|Aleksandrovsky coal mine|lt=Aleksandrovsky (Oleksandrivska) coal mine|ru|Александровский рудник (Донецк)|uk|Олександрівська копальня (Юзівка)}} eventually being opened there.

The city of Donetsk was founded in 1869 by [[Wales|Welsh]] businessman [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]], who operated a steel plant and several coal mines at Aleksandrovka. The worker's settlement at the plant merged with Aleksandrovka and the place was named Yuzovo/Yuzove, later Yuzovka/Yuzivka ({{langx|ru|Юзово, Юзовка}}, {{Langx|uk|Юзове, Юзівка}}), after Hughes.<ref>''Yuz'' is a Russian or Ukrainian approximation of Hughes</ref><ref>{{cite Efron|Юзово}}</ref> In its early period, it received immigrants from Wales, especially from the town of [[Merthyr Tydfil]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Martin |date=June 11, 2012 |title=Euro 2012: Donetsk's roots have more in common with Merthyr Tydfil than Moscow |publisher=Telegraph  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9323465/Euro-2012-Donetsks-roots-have-more-in-common-with-Merthyr-Tydfil-than-Moscow.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9323465/Euro-2012-Donetsks-roots-have-more-in-common-with-Merthyr-Tydfil-than-Moscow.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=2014-08-09}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="BBC220320">{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Ukraine: Fear for Donetsk after eight-year war escalates|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-60738988|date=20 March 2022|access-date=20 March 2022}}</ref> By the beginning of the 20th century, Yuzovka had approximately 50,000 inhabitants,<ref>The population included mostly migrants from neighbouring Russian territories</ref> and attained the status of a city in 1917.<ref name="mayor">{{cite web |date=19 November 2004 |title=From the history of the city |url=http://lukyanchenko.dn.ua/today/view.php?cat=7&subcat=7&type=1&lang=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050521150625/http://lukyanchenko.dn.ua/today/view.php?cat=7&subcat=7&type=1&lang=en |archive-date=21 May 2005 |website=Official site of the Head of Donetsk City}}</ref> The main district of Yuzovka is named English Colony, and the British origin of the city is reflected in its layout and architecture.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

When the [[Russian Civil War]] broke out, Yuzivka became a part of [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] as per the [[Third Universal of the Ukrainian Central Council|Third Universal]]. It became a part of [[Administrative division of Ukraine (1918)|Cuman Zemlia]], the administrative center of which was [[Bakhmut]]. During the First [[Ukrainian–Soviet War]], Yuzivka was captured by the Bolshevik forces on 5 January 1918, but then recaptured by Ukraine in April.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-30 |title= |script-title=uk:30 квітня – 105 років з дня звільнення Донбасу від більшовиків |trans-title=April 30 – 105 years since the liberation of Donbas from the Bolsheviks |url=https://dn.gov.ua/news/30-kvitnya-105-rokiv-z-dnya-zvilnennya-donbasu-vid-bilshovikiv |website=Donetsk Oblast state administration |language=uk}}</ref> Soviet forces captured Yuzivka again during the Second Ukrainian–Soviet War. Donetsk became a part of [[Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic|Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic]] from its declaration of independence on 12 February 1918. The Republic was disbanded at the [[Second All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets|2nd All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets]] on 20 March 1918, when the independence of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic]] was declared. It failed to achieve recognition, either internationally or by the [[Russian SFSR]], and was abolished under the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].

In 1924, under [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet rule]], the city's name was changed to Stalin. In that year, the city's population totaled 63,708, and in the next year, 80,085. In 1929–31 the city's name was changed to Stalino.<ref name="alldonetsk.info">http://alldonetsk.info/en/history-city-donetsk {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721183935/http://alldonetsk.info/en/history-city-donetsk |date=21 July 2011 }} The history of the city of Donetsk</ref> The city did not have a drinking water system until 1931, when a {{convert|55.3|km|1|abbr=on}} system was laid underground.

Some sources{{Which|date=March 2012}} state that the city was briefly called Trotsk—after [[Leon Trotsky]]—for a few months in late 1923.

At the start of [[World War II]], the population of Stalino was 507,000. After the war, the population was 175,000. The [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] by [[Nazi Germany]] almost completely destroyed the city. It was occupied by German and Italian forces as part of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] between 16 October 1941 and 5 September 1943. It was mostly rebuilt on a large scale after the war.

In 1945, young men and women aged 17 to 35, from the [[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian ''(Schwowe)'']] communities of [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] (the [[Batschka]] and [[Banat]]), were forcibly sent to Russia as Allied "war reparations", being put to work as slave labour to rebuild Stalino and to work in its mines. The conditions were so poor that many died from disease and malnutrition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Das politische Bewusstsein |url=http://www.hog-kernei.de/PDF/Internierung%20und%20Vertreibung.pdf |access-date=2013-03-26}}</ref>

During [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s second wave of [[destalinization]] in November 1961, the city was renamed Donetsk, after the [[Seversky Donets]] River, a tributary of the [[Don (Russia)|Don]]<ref name="lukianchenko" /> in order to distance it from the former leader [[Joseph Stalin]].

In 1965, the Donetsk Academy of Sciences was established as part of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR]].

===Independent Ukraine===
After the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declaration of independence]] made by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on 24 August 1991 the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum]] was held on 1 December 1991. In this referendum 83.90% of Donetsk's voters voted in favour of independence.<ref name="independence referendum Donetsk">{{cite book |editor1=Andreas Klinke |editor2=Ortwin Renn |editor3=Jean-Paul Lehners |title=Ethnic Conflicts and Civil Society: Proposals for a New Era in Eastern Europe|year=2020 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781138935525|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMVKDwAAQBAJ&dq=dnipropetrovsk+1990%27s+%22Ukrainian+language%22&pg=PT122}}</ref>

After experiencing a tough time in the 1990s, when it was the center of gang wars for control over industrial enterprises, Donetsk modernised quickly, largely under the influence of big companies.

In 1994 a consultative referendum was held in [[Donetsk Oblast]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]], with around 90% supporting recognition of [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian]] as an official language alongside [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and for [[Russian language|Russian]] to be an official language on a regional level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flynn |first1=M.

In the 1990s and the 2000s, hundreds were killed in coal mine collapses in Donetsk and the region. These included the [[2008 Ukraine coal mine collapse]], the [[2007 Zasyadko mine disaster]], and the [[2015 Zasyadko mine disaster]]. Ukraine has had many mining accidents since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with one reason cited as the linking of miners' pay to production, which is an incentive to ignore safety procedures that slow production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7103086.stm|title=Ukraine's mine death toll rises|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=20 November 2007|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>

Starting on 7 April 2014, Donetsk was ''[[de facto]]'' governed by the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] as its capital city. The Donetsk People's Republic was at that time [[International recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic|not recognized internationally]], and all [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]] recognized the city as Ukrainian. However, in February 2022, [[Russia]] recognized the DPR and the neighboring [[Luhansk People's Republic]] as sovereign states, and later that year officially annexed them (along with various other parts of Ukraine that were then at least partially under Russian military occupation). The member states of the United Nations still overwhelmingly considered the areas to be Ukrainian, with only [[Syria]], [[North Korea]], and Russia itself considering them to be Russian.

The territory of Donetsk is divided into 9 administrative [[Urban districts of Ukraine|districts]], whose local government is administered by ''district councils'', which are subordinate to the Donetsk City Council.

After playing a single season in the [[Russian Major League]], the club upgraded its arena to [[Kontinental Hockey League]] regulations, and joined the league in 2012. When moving to the KHL, the club created a local farm club to play in the Ukrainian Championship under the name [[HC Donbass-2]], which won the 2012 and 2013 national titles.

Donetsk was also home to the basketball club [[BC Donetsk]], which played in the [[Ukrainian Basketball Super League]], and won the 2012 champion title. The club played at the [[Druzhba Arena]], and Donetsk had been chosen as one of the 6 Ukrainian cities to host the [[FIBA EuroBasket 2015]]. However, the club discontinued play after 2014 due to the ongoing war, and the 2015 FIBA tournament had to be moved out of the country.

[[Sergey Bubka|Serhii Bubka]], regarded by many as the greatest pole vaulter in history, grew up in the city, and also started in 1992 an annual pole vaulting event in Donetsk, called [[Pole Vault Stars]]. Bubka himself set the [[Men's pole vault indoor world record progression|world indoor record]] at the event three times (1990, 1991, 1993). His indoor world pole vault record of 6.15m, set in the Donetsk Olympic Stadium on 21 February 1993, was not broken until 2014. The [[Russia]]n female pole vaulter [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] set a new world record at the event every year between 2004 and 2009.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Donetsk britania 02.jpg|thumb|The ''Velikobritaniya'' ({{langx|en|Great Britain}}) hotel is one of the oldest buildings in Donetsk, constructed in 1883.]]

Donetsk, at the time ''Yuzovka'', was divided into two parts: north and south. In the southern part were the city's factories, railway stations, telegraph buildings, hospitals and schools. Not far from the factories was the ''English colony'' where the engineers and the management lived. After the construction of the residence of [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] and the various complexes for the foreign workers, the city's southern portion was constructed mainly in the English style. 

These buildings used rectangular and triangular shaped façades, green rooftops, large windows, which occupied a large portion of the building, and balconies. In this part of the town, the streets were large and had pavements. A major influence on the formation of architecture in Donetsk was the ''official architect'' of a [[Novorossiya]] company — ''Moldingauyer''. Preserved buildings of the southern part of Yuzovka consisted of the residences of John Hughes (''1891, partially preserved''), Bolfur (''1889'') and Bosse.

In the northern part of Yuzovka, ''Novyi Svet'', lived traders, craftsmen and bureaucrats. Here were located the market hall, the police headquarters and the [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Donetsk|Transfiguration Cathedral]]. The central street of Novyi Svet and the neighbouring streets were mainly edged by one- or two-story residential buildings, as well as markets, restaurants, hotels, offices and banks. A famous preserved building in the northern part of Yuzovka was the Hotel Great Britain.

The first general plan of Stalino was made in 1932 in [[Odesa]] by the architect P. Golovchenko. In 1937, the project was partly reworked. These projects were the first in the city's construction bureau's history.

A large portion of the city's buildings from the second half of the 20th century were designed by the architect Pavel Vigdergauz, which was given the [[USSR State Prize|Government award of the USSR]] for architecture in the city of Donetsk in 1978.

In 2014, a leaflet carrying the signature of the "Chairman of Donetsk's temporary government Denis Pushilin" was distributed to Jews on the festival of Passover. The leaflet asked Donetsk's Jewish citizens to register themselves, their property, and their families to the pro-Russian authorities. The leaflet claimed that failure to comply with its demands would result in the revocation of citizenship and confiscation of property.

== Museums ==
[[File:2012. Презентация каталога 100 икон 007.jpg|thumb|Donetsk Regional Museum of Art]]
Donetsk is home to about 140 museums. Among them, two large regional museums – Donetsk Region History Museum and Donetsk Regional Art Museum.

Donetsk Region History Museum reveals the city's true identity and covers to the entire local community, diverse as it is. Set up in 1924, it offers an extensive expo with 120,000 exhibits: from archeological findings dating back to pre-historic times to the founding of the city by John Hughes, development of industry and coal mining, World War II and the Soviet times. On 21 August 2014, the mayor of Donetsk reported that the roof and walls of the Donetsk Regional History Museum had been destroyed by shellfire early that morning.<ref>{{cite web|first=Sophia|last=Kishkovsky|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Eastern-Ukraines-museums-told-to-hide-their-collections/33387|title=Eastern Ukraine's museums told to hide their collections|publisher=theartnewspaper.com|date=14 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816225843/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Eastern-Ukraines-museums-told-to-hide-their-collections/33387|archive-date=16 August 2014}}</ref>

FC Shaktar Museum was opened in 2010. This museum was the first Ukrainian museum to be nominated for a [[European Museum of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://donbass-arena.com/en/news/20139 |title=FC Shakhtar Museum nominated for an 'Oscar' |publisher=Donbass-arena.com |date=19 May 2012 |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502022533/http://donbass-arena.com/en/news/20139 |archive-date=2 May 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

== Transport ==

=== Local transport ===
[[File:Trolleybus Donezk.jpg|thumb|A Donetsk trolleybus with the Transfiguration Cathedral in the background]]
[[File:TramLM2008.jpg|thumb|Tram LM-2008]]

The main forms of transport within Donetsk are: [[Trams in Donetsk|trams]], electric [[trolley bus]]es, buses and [[marshrutka]]s (private [[minibus]]ses). The city's public transport system is controlled by the united ''Dongorpastrans'' [[municipal]] company. The city has 12 tram lines (~130&nbsp;km), 17 trolley bus lines (~188&nbsp;km), and about 115 bus lines.<ref name="transport">{{cite web|url=http://www.partner.donetsk.ua/transport/|script-title=ru:Транспорт|trans-title=Transport|work=Partner-Portal|access-date=11 May 2007|language=ru|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510133417/http://www.partner.donetsk.ua/transport/|archive-date=10 May 2007}}</ref> Both the tram and trolley bus systems in the city are served by 2 [[Bus station|depots]] each.<ref name="transport" /> Another method of transport within the city is [[taxicab]] service, of which there are 32 in Donetsk.

The city also contains railway stations located within the city and its suburbs: railway station ''Yuzhny'' (South), which serves mainly transport lines to the south, hence its name; railway station ''Tsentr'' (Centre), which serves transport in the direction of [[Marinka, Ukraine|Marinka]] and [[Vuhledar]] as well as intercity transport; the railway station ''Krytyi rynok'' (Indoor market), which serves mainly transport in the north and east directions; and the railway station ''Putilovsky'', which serves mainly the north and northwest transport directions.

The construction of the [[Donetsk Metro|metro]] system in the city, begun in 1992, was abandoned in 2012 due to the lack of funding. No lines or stations have been finished.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=uk:У Донецьку припиняють зводити метро|trans-title=Metro construction in Donetsk is stopping|work=1tv.com.ua |date=18 January 2012|language=uk|url=http://1tv.com.ua/uk/news/2012/01/18/14506|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502190006/http://1tv.com.ua/uk/news/2012/01/18/14506|archive-date=2 May 2013}}</ref>

=== Railways ===
[[File:Donezk Bahnhof 2.JPG|thumb|[[Donetsk railway station|Donetsk's main railway station]], located in the north of the city|left]]

[[Donetsk railway station|Donetsk's main railway station]], which at the  beginning of the 21st century served about 7 million passengers annually,<ref name="transport" /> is located in the northern part of the city. There is a museum near the main station, dealing with the history of the region's railways. Other railway stations are: ''Rutchenkovo'', located in the Kyivskyi District; ''Mandrykino'' (Petrovskyi District), and ''Mushketovo'' (Budionnivskyi District). Some passenger trains avoid Donetsk station and serve the [[Yasynuvata]] station, located outside the city limits. Although not used for regular transport, the city also has a children's railway. As of September 2009, a new railway terminal facility to comply with [[UEFA]] requirements (since Donetsk was one of the host cities for [[UEFA EURO 2012]]) was planned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/order/?id=170301|title=Construction of railway terminal in Donetsk for UEFA EURO 2012 worth UAH 414mln|work=[[Ukrinform]]|date=23 September 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162528/http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/order/?id=170301|archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref>

The Donetsk Oblast was an important transport hub in Ukraine, so was its centre Donetsk. The ''[[Donets Railway|Donetsk Railways]]'', based in Donetsk, was the largest railway division in the region.

=== Road transport ===
The [[File:Tabliczka E50.svg|25px|link=European route E50]] highway, part of the [[International E-road network]], runs through the city ''en route'' to [[Rostov-on-Don]] in [[Russia]].

In addition, another international road runs through the city: the [[Highway M04 (Ukraine)|M 04]]. Also, three national Ukrainian roads (N 15, N 20, and N 21) pass through the city.

The construction of the fourth stage of a circular road bypassing Donetsk was to be completed in 2014.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/185414.html Building of fourth stage of Donetsk ring road to end in 2014], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 January 2014)</ref>

=== Air travel ===
In addition to public and rail transport, Donetsk used to have an [[Donetsk Airport|international airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vip-terminal.dn.ua/|title=Service Center, International Airport 'Donetsk' |access-date=6 March 2007|work=VIP-Terminal|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615231005/http://www.vip-terminal.dn.ua/eng/index.htm}}</ref> It was constructed during the early 1940s and early 1950s. It was rebuilt in 1973 and again from 2011 to 2012. Because of fighting the airport has been closed as of 26 May 2014 and the airport has since then largely been destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loiko|first=Sergei L. |url=https://www.latimes.com/world/great-reads/la-fg-c1-ukraine-airport-20141028-story.html|title=Ukraine fighters, surrounded at wrecked airport, refuse to give up|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Donetsk|date=28 October 2014 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028102545/http://www.latimes.com/world/great-reads/la-fg-c1-ukraine-airport-20141028-story.html|archive-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> The airspace above Donetsk has also been closed since the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|MH17]] disaster.

== Education ==
[[File:Donetsk df 2006 01.jpg|thumb|Physics Day in Donetsk National University, 2006]]
Donetsk has several universities, which include five state [[university|universities]], 11 [[institute]]s, three [[academy|academies]], 14 [[tekhnikum]]s, five [[private university|private universities]], and six [[college]]s.

The National Technical University held close contacts with the university in Magdeburg. Since 1970, more than 100 students from Germany (''[[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]]'') have completed their higher education at either one of the two main universities in Donetsk. Donetsk is also the home of the [[Donetsk National Medical University]], which was founded in 1930 and became one of the largest medical universities in the [[Soviet Union]]. There are also several scientific research institutes and an [[Islam]]ic University within Donetsk.
