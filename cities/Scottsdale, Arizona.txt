==History==
===Early history===
Scottsdale was originally a [[Akimel O'odham|Pima]] village known as {{lang|ood|Vaṣai S-vaṣonĭ}}, meaning {{gloss|rotting hay}}.<ref>Saxton, Dean, Saxton, Lucille, & Enos, Susie. (1983). ''Dictionary: Tohono O'odham/Pima to English, English to Tohono O'odham/Pima''. Tucson, Arizona: The University of Arizona Press</ref> Some Pima people remain there today. Until the late 1960s, there was a still-occupied traditional dwelling on the southeast corner of Indian Bend Road and Hayden Road. The Pima who live in Scottsdale today reside in modern houses, not traditional dwellings. Many Pima and Maricopa people live in the [[Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community]], which borders Scottsdale to the south and east.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thebestofscottsdale.org/anoceanofsky/About.html|title=The Best of Scottsdale|access-date=January 5, 2014|archive-date=January 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106034526/http://thebestofscottsdale.org/anoceanofsky/About.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Early history and establishment===
[[File:Winfield & Helen Scott, 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Winfield & Helen Scott, 1900]]
In the early to mid-1880s, [[U.S. Army]] Chaplain [[Winfield Scott (chaplain)|Winfield Scott]] visited the Salt River Valley and was impressed with it and its potential for agriculture.<ref name=ScotHist>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/about/history|title=The West's Most Western Town|publisher=Scottsdaleaz.gov}}</ref> Returning in 1888 with his wife, Helen, he purchased {{cvt|640|acre}} where historic Old Town is now, for $3.50 an acre (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3.5|1888|2015|r=0}}}} as of 2015) {{Inflation-fn|US}}.  Another landowner in the Southern part of town, Albert G. Utley, filed plans with Maricopa County for a city named "Orangedale," using Scott's Field as a border.  When the newspaper, then called the ''Arizona Republican'', published an article about the plan, they erroneously called the town "Scottsdale."  The article drew some publicity for the town, and ultimately this convinced Utley to change his filing and officially name the town "Scottsdale."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Messinger |first=Paul |title=Scottsdale got its name through newspaper error |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale/2014/08/01/scottsdale-got-name-newspaper-error/13462809/ |access-date=February 7, 2023 |website=The Arizona Republic}}</ref>

[[File:First Schoolhouse 1896.jpg|thumb|First schoolhouse in Scottsdale]]
In 1896, the Scottsdale Public School system was established,<ref name=ScotHist /> and opened the first schoolhouse, which was followed by the opening of the first general store by J.&nbsp;L. Davis, which also housed the first post office for Scottsdale in 1897.<ref name="Exp">{{cite web |title=History of Scottsdale |url=http://www.experiencescottsdale.com/history-of-scottsdale/ |publisher=Scottsdale Convention & Visitor's Bureau}}</ref><ref name="Insider">{{cite web |title=About Scottsdale |url=http://www.insider-scottsdale.com/Scottsdale_History.htm |publisher=InSider Scottsdale}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Scottsdale's History in Pictures |url=http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/singleitem/collection/splimage/id/25/rec/26 |url-status=dead |publisher=Scottsdale Public Library |access-date=January 5, 2014 |archive-date=January 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031624/http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/singleitem/collection/splimage/id/25/rec/26 }}</ref> In the early 1900s the community supported an artists and writers culture,<ref name=ScotHist /> culminating in the opening of the region's first resort in 1909, the Ingleside Inn, just south of the Arizona Canal and west of the Crosscut Canal (Indian School Road at about 64th Street) in what is today Scottsdale.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Phoenix City Directory| publisher = Arizona Directory Company| page = 3| year = 1912}}<br>- {{cite web|url=http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/ref/collection/splimage/id/41|title=Scottsdale's History in Images|publisher=Scottsdale Public Library}}</ref> Also in 1909, Cavalliere's Blacksmith Shop opened in downtown Scottsdale, and the original schoolhouse was replaced by the much more expansive Little Red Schoolhouse, which stands to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/singleitem/collection/splimage/id/19/rec/20|title=Scottsdale's History in Images|publisher=Scottsdale Public Library}}</ref> While not in its original building, Cavalliere's has been in continuous operation since that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Assets/Public+Website/historiczoning/SHRrptCavalliersI.pdf |title=Scottsdale Historic Register |publisher=Scottsdale |access-date=January 5, 2014 |archive-date=July 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702151333/http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Assets/Public+Website/historiczoning/SHRrptCavalliersI.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1912, both the [[Phoenix Street Railway]] Company and a competitor, the Salt River Valley Electric Railway Company, proposed building [[streetcar]] lines to Scottsdale,<ref>{{Cite web| title = Electric Railway Journal articles archived by the Phoenix Trolley Museum| url = http://phoenixtrolley.com/2010/06/09/the-salt-river-valley-electric-railway/| access-date = July 11, 2011}}</ref> but due to an economic downturn, neither was built. Between 1908 and 1933, due to the construction of the Granite Reef and Roosevelt dams (in 1908 and 1911, respectively), Scottsdale's population experienced a boom, growing steadily during those years. It became a small market town providing services for families involved in the agricultural industry.<ref name=ScotHist />

During the [[First World War]], Scottsdale and its environs supported a large cotton farming industry, due to the creation of Long Staple Egyptian Cotton, developed by the [[US Department of Agriculture]]. Cotton is still grown in southern Arizona, but Scottsdale's cotton boom ended with the loss of government contracts at the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jandatri.com/pdfs/history-of-cotton-in-arizona.pdf | publisher=Jandatri.com | title=History of Cotton in Arizona: A Timeline | access-date=January 27, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127114811/http://www.jandatri.com/pdfs/history-of-cotton-in-arizona.pdf | archive-date=January 27, 2015}}</ref>
[[File:Jokake Inn 1926.jpg|thumb|right|Jokake Inn, Scottsdale]]

In 1920, a second resort was opened on {{cvt|12|acre}} of property owned by the artist [[Jessie Benton Evans]].

[[Great Depression in the United States|The Depression]] years saw an influx of artists and architects to Scottsdale, which included, in 1937, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Wright and his wife purchased {{cvt|600|acre}} acres of desert at the foot of the [[McDowell Mountains]] and established [[Taliesin West]], his winter home and his architectural firm's southwestern headquarters.<ref name=ScotHist /><ref name=Exp /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taliesin.edu/history.html|title=Taliesin Historical Legacy|publisher=Taliesin}}</ref> Scottsdale and the rest of Phoenix have seen an everlasting influence from Wright.

===World War II===
Among the more significant events during the years of World War II was the opening of Thunderbird II Airfield in 1942 (it later became Scottsdale Airport),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/airport/history|title=Scottsdale Airport History|publisher=Scottsdaleaz.gov}}</ref> where 5,500 pilot cadets received their primary flight training before the war's end.

===Development of Indian Bend Wash, 1950s–1970s===
In 1950, the town continued to grow as [[Motorola]] became the first of many technology companies to build a plant in Scottsdale. It built a second plant in 1956.<ref name=ScotHist /> With a population of approximately 2,000, the city was incorporated on June 25, 1951. It appointed its [[List of mayors of Scottsdale|first mayor]], Malcolm White, and adopted the motto "The West's Most Western Town".<ref name=ScotHist /> The seal, depicting a mounted cowboy surrounded by a 64-pointed starburst, was designed by Mrs. Gene Brown Pennington.<ref>{{Cite journal| first = Patricia Seitters | last = Myers| title = Scottsdale: Jewel in the Desert}}</ref> The city also became a tourist destination with the opening of the city's first modern resorts, the [[Hotel Valley Ho]] and the [[Safari Hotel]], in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/126125382/ |title=Swinging Safari, Valley Ho were happening in the 1950s |first=Dan|last=Nowicki|date=July 26, 2004 |website=Arizona Republic}}</ref>

The town began a period of rapid population growth after its incorporation in 1951, growing from 2,000 to 10,000 residents during the 1950s.<ref name=ScotHist /> This growth necessitated development into the floodplain known as the [[Indian Bend Wash]]. Floodplains throughout history have been enticing locations for development due to their flatness, ease of building and inexpensiveness. This is even more tempting in a desert, where flooding so rarely happens. As Scottsdale expanded, the north-south Indian Bend Wash virtually bisected the city. In the late 1950s, the problem became more and more pronounced, until in 1959 the Arizona State Legislature formed the Maricopa County Flood Control District (MCFCD). The MCFCD became the lead player in developing a comprehensive flood plan for the entire county.<ref name=IBW>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Assets/Public+Website/parks/IndianBendWashBook.pdf |title=Indian Bend Wash Book |publisher=Scottsdale |access-date=January 5, 2014 |archive-date=July 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702141821/http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Assets/Public+Website/parks/IndianBendWashBook.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

At the same time, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] began to look into flooding in Maricopa County. Over the next several years, it presented several plans, which all revolved around constructing concrete canals and levees to channel and divert the floodwaters, as well as building bridges over the canal, similar to the storm drains of Los Angeles. But during MCFCD meetings between 1961 and 1963, a different course of action was developed. This plan became known as the multi-use, or Greenbelt, concept. The two concepts were at odds with one another until the canal plan was defeated in a bond referendum in 1965. In 1966, a study was commissioned that validated the Greenbelt concept as a way to prevent flood damage. After a major flood in 1972, work on the Greenbelt project began in earnest. It was completed in 1984, although minor projects continue.<ref name=IBW /> Today, the {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} Scottsdale Greenbelt<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scottsdaletrails.com/2011/11/14/from-ditch-to-diamonds/ | title=From Ditch to Diamonds |website= Scottsdale Trails | date=November 14, 2011 }}</ref> connects four city parks—Vista del Camino Park, Eldorado Park, Indian School Park and Chaparral Park—through a {{convert|25|mi|adj=on}} bike path.

===Further expansion and development, 1970s–1980s===
[[File:Scottsdale-Scottsdale Spire-1957-2007.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Scottsdale Spire]]
The city continued to grow in the 1960s and 1970s, the population reaching almost 68,000 by 1970.<ref name=Museum>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsdalemuseum.com/index.php/history/key-events-in-the-history-of-scottsdale |title=Key Events in the History of Scottsdale |publisher=Scottsdale Museum}}</ref> Most of the unused property within the city limits was to the north, so that was the direction in which the city expanded. The city, which in 1959 had spanned {{cvt|5|sqmi}}, expanded its borders to encompass {{cvt|62|sqmi}}.<ref name=ScotHist /> Large ranch tracts covered huge areas in the northern part of the city. One of the largest of these was the McCormick ranch, a {{cvt|4236|acre|adj=on}} ranch serving much of the eastern boundary of Scottsdale owned by Fowler and Anne McCormick. Fowler's paternal grandfather was [[Cyrus McCormick]], the inventor of the grain reaper, and his maternal grandfather was [[John D. Rockefeller]].<ref name=AZOdd>{{cite web|url=http://arizonaoddities.com/2009/12/the-stories-behind-scottsdales-mccormick-ranch-gainey-ranch/|title=The Story Behind Scottsdale's McCormick Ranch|date=December 22, 2009|publisher=Arizona Oddities}}</ref> When Anne died in 1970, the property was sold to Kaiser-Aetna for $12.1&nbsp;million.<ref name=RR>{{cite web|url=http://www.therailroadpark.com/history-ranch|title=History of McCormick Ranch|publisher=McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park}}</ref> This started a series of large-scale, master-planned communities within Scottsdale's borders, including Scottsdale Ranch (1978),<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.scottsdaleranch.org/history-summary| title=Scottsdale Ranch History| access-date=January 5, 2014| archive-date=January 6, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032820/http://www.scottsdaleranch.org/history-summary| url-status=dead}}</ref> Gainey Ranch (1980),<ref name=AZOdd /> McDowell Mountain Ranch (1992),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://scottsdaleindeed.com/MMR_History.html|title=McDowell Mountain Ranch History}}</ref> Desert Mountain (1986),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://desertmountain.com/become-a-member/history/|title=Desert Mountain History}}</ref> and DC Ranch (1990s).<ref name=DCR>{{cite web | url=http://www.dcranch.com/For_Residents/Community_Overview/DCRanchHistory.htm|title=History |publisher=DC Ranch }}</ref>

In 1975, the city annexed the "east Shea" section, bordering [[Fountain Hills]], expanding its area from {{cvt|62.2 to 88.6|sqmi}}. This was followed by a four-year period from 1981 to 1984 during which the city annexed an additional (almost) {{cvt|80|sqmi}}.<ref name=Museum />

Faced with this rapid expansion and growth, many residents became concerned about losing their southwestern scenery. The McDowell Sonoran Conservancy was born in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdowellsonoran.org/content/pages/history#sthash.o3BD6SOK.dpbs|title=What Trail Led Us Here|publisher=McDowell Sonoran Conservancy|access-date=January 5, 2014|archive-date=January 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032135/http://www.mcdowellsonoran.org/content/pages/history#sthash.o3BD6SOK.dpbs|url-status=dead}}</ref> Teaming with developers, a plan was developed to set aside the McDowell Mountains and adjoining areas in a huge preserve. In 1995, Scottsdale's citizens voted to implement a sales tax to purchase acreage for this purpose. When completed, the {{cvt|36,000|acre}} planned for the McDowell Sonoran Preserve will be nearly one-third of Scottsdale's land area, equal in size to [[Bryce Canyon National Park]].<ref name=ScotHist /><ref name=DCR />

===Modern===
From its official incorporation in 1951 with a population of 2,000, Scottsdale has grown to a 2020 census count of 241,361. It is now the state's seventh-largest city. Scottsdale is commonly defined by its high quality of life, and in 1993 was one of several cities to receive a "Most Livable City" award from the [[United States Conference of Mayors]].<ref>"[http://www.scottsdalecvb.com/about/index.cfm?action=history Scottsdale History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427053122/http://www.scottsdalecvb.com/about/index.cfm?action=history |date=April 27, 2006 }}."

===Religion===
Scottsdale is home to a large number of [[church (building)|churches]], [[chapels]], [[temples]], [[synagogues]], [[mosques]] and other places of religious worship. Though the majority of Scottsdale residents consider themselves of, or practicing of, the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith(s) – including [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] – the city's high population growth over the years has resulted in a more diverse population. Most notably, greater numbers of [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Jews]] have been added to the population. Though smaller in number, [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]] and [[Buddhist]] communities also exist within the city of Scottsdale. There is also a small population of members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], as is common throughout Phoenix, Arizona, and the Western United States.

The first church founded in Scottsdale was the First Baptist Church of Scottsdale, which was built by Scott and his family. The church has named a small non-profit coffee shop on the corner of their campus after Scott, called Winfield's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fbcscottsdale.church/media/tell-the-story|title=First Church{{!}} First Scottsdale Church|website=www.fbcscottsdale.church/ |access-date=June 12, 2020}}</ref>

The [[tourism]] industry is Scottsdale's primary employer, accounting for 39% of the city's workforce. In 2005, Scottsdale attracted over 7.5&nbsp;million visitors to the city, providing an economic impact of over $3.1&nbsp;billion.<ref name="tourism_numbers">"[http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/listserve/ViewMessage.asp?MsgID=41814 Headline News]."

The city of Scottsdale is tied with Atlanta for fourth, after New York City, Las Vegas, and Chicago respectively, as having the most [[American Automobile Association|AAA Five-Diamond]] hotels and resorts in the United States. In 2015, AAA bestowed four such properties in Scottsdale with the highest honor: The Phoenician and The Canyon Suites, part of [[The Luxury Collection]], [[Four Seasons Hotels]] Scottsdale at Troon North, and the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts]] Princess Resort and Spa.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aaa.biz/Travel_Information/Diamonds/Awards/2015/January%202015%20-%205D%20Hotels.pdf | publisher=AAA | title=AAA/CAA Five Diamond Hotels – January 16, 2015 | access-date=February 27, 2015 | date=January 16, 2015 | archive-date=January 19, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119082845/http://www.aaa.biz/Travel_Information/Diamonds/Awards/2015/January%202015%20-%205D%20Hotels.pdf | url-status=dead }}</ref>

The region's year-round warm weather and abundant sunshine is a major factor in Scottsdale's tourism appeal. In particular, during the winter, thousands of tourists and retirees from the midwest, the northeast, and as far away as Canada (known locally as "[[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]]") flood the area with visits from brief to long term. Those who practice the same migration routine annually often end up purchasing winter homes in the area.<ref name="snowbirds">Roxborough, Shannon.

The [[aviation]] industry has also grown in Scottsdale, with the construction of [[Scottsdale Airport]] in North Scottsdale, in the 1960s. Today, it is one of the busiest single-runway airports in the United States in terms of aircraft operations. However, there is little to no commercial air service; nearly all operations are corporate or [[general aviation]].

The immediate area surrounding the Scottsdale Airport, known locally as the Airpark, has developed rapidly as a regional center of commerce. By 2004, the Airpark had grown to become the second-largest employment center in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]], with over 50,000 people being employed within a few-mile radius of the airport itself&nbsp;– notably in financial, retail, service, technological, design and manufacturing fields.

===Nightlife===
[[File:HotelValleyHo-at-dawn.jpg|thumb|The [[Hotel Valley Ho]] caters to both day and night entertainment.]]

Scottsdale is home to a variety of nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, lounges and bars most notably in the Old-Town district.
This is evident by the growing number of style-conscious hotels that have opened up throughout Downtown Scottsdale which equally cater to the nightlife crowds.

The majority of nightlife is concentrated in Downtown Scottsdale, between Camelback and Osborn roads. This is the most active and popular nightlife destination in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Similar to well-known nightclub districts in other major cities, much like [[Atlanta]]'s [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] district and [[Miami]]'s [[South Beach]], most of Downtown Scottsdale's major bars and clubs are generally within walking distance. Crowds of over 40,000-strong are known to congregate to this area.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-12-13-scottsdale_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Old West meets New West in Scottsdale, Ariz. | first=Jayne | last=Clark | date=December 20, 2007 | access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Old Town Scottsdale consists of active night clubs, dive bars, entertainment restaurants and shopping around every corner.

The [[Talking Stick Resort]] is an attraction and a part of the Scottsdale night life with their 98,000 square feet casino. Within the same vicinity are the Butterfly Wonderland, [[OdySea Aquarium]] that holds over 6,000 animals in 2,000,000 gallons of water, iFly Zone and many shopping centers including Fashion Square, just north of Old Town Scottsdale.

===Indian gaming===
Southeast Scottsdale borders the [[Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community]]. For several years, the Scottsdale Pavilions, a major outdoor [[shopping center]], marked the only commercial property operating on tribal lands. In 1998, the tribe opened the first permanent casino in the Scottsdale area, [[Casino Arizona]], at [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]] and McKellips Road. The success of Casino Arizona led to the construction of a second location, [[Talking Stick Resort|Casino Arizona at Indian Bend]], in a temporary facility less than {{convert|8|mi|km}} north.

The passage of Proposition 202 in November 2002 redefined casino gaming in Arizona, permitting "Vegas-style" blackjack and poker, expanded number of slot machines and wider food and beverage service options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cardplayer.com/cardplayer-poker-magazines/47-casino-arizona-15-25|title=Casino Arizona Vol. 15, No. 25 Card Player Magazine|website=www.cardplayer.com}}</ref> Both casinos underwent significant expansions following the passage of Proposition 202, with Casino Arizona at Indian Bend more than doubling in size.

In 2010, the temporary tent facilities hosting the {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Casino Arizona at Indian Bend were deconstructed following the opening of Casino Arizona at Talking Stick Resort. The {{convert|240000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} casino is adjoined to the newly constructed 15-story Talking Stick Resort & Spa, which features the Talking Stick golf course, a 36-hole [[golf course]] designed by [[Ben Crenshaw]] and [[Bill Coore]].

Scottsdale is governed by a [[List of mayors of Scottsdale|mayor]] and [[city council]], all of whom are elected "at large" to represent the entire city rather than districts within the city. A [[city manager]] is responsible for the executive leadership of the city staff, as well as implementing council policies, developing programs and budgets to respond to council goals, and ensuring citizens receive effective and efficient city services. The city manager also serves as the city treasurer.

{{As of|2021|}}, the current mayor is David Ortega.<ref>{{cite web |title= Mayor David Ortega |url=https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/council/mayor-david-ortega |website=City of Scottsdale website |access-date=January 29, 2021}}</ref>

Scottsdale is part of [[Arizona's 1st congressional district]].

The distinctive Scottsdale City Hall was designed by architect [[Bennie Gonzales]] in 1968, and was designed with an interior [[kiva]] for community meetings.<ref name=evt>{{cite news |first=Mark|last=Scarp|title=Gonzales left his creative imprint on Scottsdale |url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/article_316c4db2-da60-5305-bd60-b466349b59af.html?login_success=true |work=[[East Valley Tribune]]|date=December 4, 2008 |access-date=January 4, 2009}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Freeways====
[[Arizona State Route 101|State Route 101]]&nbsp;– locally known as Loop 101&nbsp;– provides convenient [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Phoenix|Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways]] access.

====Air====
The city is home to [[Scottsdale Municipal Airport]] {{Airport codes|SCF|KSDL}}, a single-runway airport in North Scottsdale. While the airport serves some tour and commuter flights, the plurality of aircraft operations are corporate and transient general aviation traffic.

[[File:Autocarro em Scottsdale.jpg|thumb|right|Scottsdale Trolley]]

====Public transit====
Public bus service for Scottsdale and the Phoenix Metropolitan Area is provided by [[Valley Metro]].

The city of Scottsdale runs a network of local neighborhood circulators, labeled the "Scottsdale Trolley." Using [[Tourist trolley|trolley-replica bus]]es, the public service is free to riders. {{As of|2021|}}, there are two circulating "routes," known individually as the Downtown Trolley and the Neighborhood Trolley. These connect at the Loloma Station transit center in downtown Scottsdale.

The Downtown Trolley circulates through downtown Scottsdale, and the Neighborhood Trolley circulates from downtown Scottsdale to neighborhoods throughout South Scottsdale, connecting with the city of Tempe's own free public circulator, the Tempe Orbit at Roosevelt and Scottsdale Road. From there, riders can transfer onto the Tempe Orbit, and travel to Tempe, including Arizona State University's main campus, and the downtown Tempe, or [[Mill Avenue]], area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/trolley.asp|title=City of Scottsdale - Trolley|website=www.scottsdaleaz.gov}}</ref>

Between December 2007 and 2009, Scottsdale was a member of the board of [[Valley Metro Rail]] line which connects the neighboring cities of Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa.<ref>{{cite news|last=Powell |first=Brian |title=City opts for seat at Valley light-rail planning table |work=East Valley Tribune |date=December 13, 2007 |url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/104382 |access-date=February 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727021549/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/104382 |archive-date=July 27, 2009 }}</ref> There was a study in 2001, and some discussion since, of extending the light rail line into Scottsdale.
