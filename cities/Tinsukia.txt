It is situated {{convert|480|km|mi|0}} north-east of [[Guwahati]] and {{convert|84|km|mi|0}} away from the border with [[Arunachal Pradesh]].Tinsukia serves as the headquarters of the [[Moran Autonomous Council]], which is the governing council of the [[Moran people|Morans]] (an indigenous tribal group found predominantly in the Tinsukia district and neighbouring Arunachal pradesh).

== History ==
During the reign of [[Sudangphaa]] (1397-1407), the relatively small [[Ahom kingdom]] was attacked by [[Mongkawng|Mong Kawng]], a [[Shan State|Shan state]] in what is today [[Upper Myanmar|Upper Burma]]. A Mong Kwang army sent under General Ta-chin-Pao advanced up to Tipam but was subsequently defeated and pushed back as far as the [[Kachin state|Kham Jang]] territory.{{sfn|Phukan|1991|p=891}} The generals of the two armies conducted a peace treaty on the shore of the [[Lake of No Return|Nong Jake lake]] and in accordance with the Tai custom dipped their hands in the lake, fixing the boundary of the two kingdoms at [[Patkai|Patkai hills]].{{sfn|Phukan|1991|p=891}}

Tinsukia is the site of ''Bengmara'', which was originally known as ''Changmai Pathar''. It was the capital of the [[Matak rajya|Matak kingdom]] which was founded by Swargadeo [[Sarbananada Singha|Sarbananda Singha]].<ref name=NIC>{{cite web|title=Tinsukia|url=http://www.tinsukia.nic.in/bangmara.asp|access-date=2 May 2012}}</ref>
