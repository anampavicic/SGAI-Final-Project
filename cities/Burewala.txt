'''Burewala''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: [[Burewala Tehsil|بورے والہ]]), is a city of [[Vehari District]] in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. The city of Burewala is the headquarters of [[Burewala Tehsil]], an administrative subdivision of the district.<ref name=NRB>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=34&dn=Vehari|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805121037/http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=34&dn=Vehari|title= Tehsils & Unions in the District of Vehari|website=National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan website|archive-date= 5 August 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=31 May 2023}}</ref> It is the [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|27th largest city of Pakistan]] by population.

==History==
Burewala is situated on the [[Dehli Multan Road]]. [[Sutlej|Sutlej River]] crosses Burewala near the towns Kachi Pakki, Jamlera and Sahuka. ''Shrine of Haji Sher Dewan Chawli Mashaikh'' is also situated in Dewan Sahib at a distance of 18&nbsp;km. from Burewala. Prior to its settlement, the area was a jungle which was later populated by the Dhuddi tribe of Rajput.<ref name="World66">{{cite web|url=http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/pakistan/burewala|title= Burewala Travel Guide and City History| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531115316/http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/pakistan/burewala |archive-date=31 May 2018|website= world66.com website|access-date=31 May 2023|url-status=dead}}</ref> When the [[Pakpattan]] canal started operating in this area, people started to settle in villages as agriculture developed, resulting in jungles being cut to make way for cultivation fields. As this area was in 'Eastern Canal Division' so it was named village no. 118/EB (EB = Eastern Barr). In the northern side of Burewala tehsil, there are still signs of an old water canal which is now called Sukh Bias.<ref name=World66/>

==Etymology==
[[File:Major Tufail Muhammad Shaheed - The Tomb (7594762844).jpg|thumb|300x300px|'''The tomb of [[Tufail Mohammad|Major Tufail Muhammad Shaheed]] (Nishan e Haider)''']]
The exact origin of Burewala's name is unknown; however, there are different theories. One theory is that the city is named after a person named "Burha." He was, according to some people, 'Sikh'. The village is also called "Old Bura" or "Purana Boora." The people of this village constructed a well with a diameter of 8 feet and named it after their ancestor so it was called "Chah Boorhay wala" (Well of Burha). This well is now included in the P.I. Link canal. Due to this well the new city was named Burewala. In July 1976, Burewala was upgraded as a subdivision. The areas of Gaggo Mandi, Shaikh Fazal, Sahuka and Jamlera, Chak No.118/E.B were included in the subdivision.<ref name=NRB/>
