'''Agadir''' ({{langx|ar|أكادير|ʾagādīr}}, {{IPA|ar|ʔaɡaːdiːr|pron}}; {{langx|shi|ⴰⴳⴰⴷⵉⵔ}}) is a major [[List of cities in Morocco|city]] in [[Morocco]], on the shore of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the foot of the [[Atlas Mountains]], just north of the point where the [[Sous River|Souss River]] flows into the ocean, and {{convert|316|mi|km|order=flip}} south of [[Casablanca]]. Agadir is the capital of the [[Agadir-Ida Ou Tanane Prefecture|Agadir Ida-U-Tanan Prefecture]] and of the [[Souss-Massa]] economic region.

Agadir is one of the major urban centres of Morocco.

It was the site of the 1911 [[Agadir Crisis]] that exposed tensions between France and Germany, foreshadowing World War I. The city was destroyed by [[1960 Agadir earthquake|an earthquake]] in 1960; it has been completely rebuilt with mandatory seismic standards. It is now the largest [[seaside resort]] in Morocco, where foreign tourists and many residents are attracted by an unusually mild year-round climate. Since 2010 it has been well served by low-cost flights and a motorway from [[Tangier]].

==Etymology==
The name ''[[Agadir (granary)|Agadir]]'' is a common Berber noun, meaning 'wall, enclosure, fortified building, citadel'. This noun is attested in most Berber languages.<ref>See K. Naït-Zerrad, ''Dictionnaire des racines berbères, Ḍ-G'', Louvain: Peeters, 2002, p. 734.</ref> It may come from the [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] word ''aǧādir'' ('wall' or 'bank')<ref name="Ad01">{{Cite book |last=Room |first=Adrian |url=http://archive.org/details/africanplacename0000room |title=African placenames : origins and meanings of the names for natural features, towns, cities, provinces, and counties |date=2008 |publisher=Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland & Co. |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-7864-3546-3 |pages=17–18}}</ref> or from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] {{Transliteration|phn|gadir}} ('wall' or 'fortress').<ref name="Ad01" /> The former word may also be a loanword from the latter.<ref>Compare Hebrew ''gādēr'' 'wall, place fortified with a wall' (see S.P. Tregelles, ''Gesenius' Hebrew-Chaldee lexicon'', Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1949, p. 160, which also mentions Classical Arabic ''jadīr'' 'a place surrounded by a wall').</ref> The Phoenician etymology, if correct, would be the same as that of [[Cádiz]] in Spain.<ref name="Ad01" />

==History==
=== Early occupation ===
The oldest known map that includes an indication of Agadir is from 1325: at the approximate location of the modern city, it names a place it calls ''Porto Mesegina'', after a Berber tribe name that had been recorded as early as the 12th century, the ''Mesguina'' (also known as the ''Ksima'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}} At the end of the medieval period, Agadir was a town of some renown. The first known mention of its name, ''Agadir al-harba'', was recorded in 1510.{{Efn|The name suggests that there was a Wednesday market – the ''souk el-arba'' close to a collective granary.

Please add clear and precise citations.}}

=== Portuguese occupation ===
In the late 15th century the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] began to occupy positions along the Moroccan coast. In 1505 the Portuguese nobleman João Lopes de Sequeira occupied the area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Agadir {{!}} Morocco {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Agadir-Morocco |access-date=18 December 2022 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=18 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221218230423/https://www.britannica.com/place/Agadir-Morocco |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":02">{{EI2|title=Agadir-Ighir|last=Tourneau|first=Roger le|volume=1|pages=244–245}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NDLCgAAQBAJ&dq=agadir+history+portuguese&pg=PA211 |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1987 |isbn=978-1-316-58334-0 |pages=207–208 |language=en |access-date=29 January 2023 |archive-date=11 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230511194619/https://books.google.com/books?id=_NDLCgAAQBAJ&dq=agadir+history+portuguese&pg=PA211 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Newitt |first=Malyn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDODAgAAQBAJ&dq=agadir+history+portuguese+santa+cruz&pg=PA66 |title=A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668 |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-134-55304-4 |pages=35–36, 66 |language=en |access-date=29 January 2023 |archive-date=21 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230421053001/https://books.google.com/books?id=HDODAgAAQBAJ&dq=agadir+history+portuguese+santa+cruz&pg=PA66 |url-status=live }}</ref> He built a wooden castle at the foot of a hill, near a [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]],<ref name=":02" /> and a Portuguese colony named ''Santa Cruz do Cabo do Gué'' was created.<ref name=":12" /> The site still bears the name of Funti<ref name=":02" /> or Founti (from the Portuguese word ''fonte,'' meaning "fountain"). The castle was later bought by the King of Portugal on 25 January 1513.<ref name=":02" />

The Portuguese presence elicited growing hostility from the local population of the [[Sous]] region, who initiated a years-long economic and military blockade of the port. In 1510 [[Abu Abdallah al-Qaim|Muhammad al-Qa'im]], the leader of a Sharifian family in that had established themselves in the Sous, was declared leader of the local military efforts against the Sous.<ref name=":02" /> His descendants went on to found the [[Saadi Sultanate|Sa'di dynasty]] which rose to power over the following decades and eventually established their capital at [[Marrakesh]]. In 1540 the Sa'di sultan [[Mohammed al-Shaykh|Muhammad al-Shaykh]] occupied the main hill (now [[Agadir Oufla]]) above the Portuguese and installed [[artillery]] to prepare an attack on the fortress below. The [[Fall of Agadir|siege of the colony]] began on 16 February 1541 and was successfully concluded on 12 March of the same year.<ref name=":02" />

Six hundred Portuguese survivors were taken prisoner, including the governor, [[Guterre de Monroy]], and his daughter, [[Dona Mecia]]. The captives were redeemed by the holy men, who were mostly from Portugal. Dona Mecia, whose husband was killed during the battle, became the wife of Sheikh Mohammed ash-Sheikh but died in childbirth in 1544. In the same year, Mohammed ash-Sheikh released Guterre de Monroy, whom he had befriended.<ref>''Chronique de Santa-Cruz du Cap de Gué'', Paris, 1934 (Fr)</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=December 2022}} After this, the Portuguese were forced to abandon most of the Moroccan areas that they had acquired control of between 1505 and 1520, including Agadir, [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] and [[Azemmour]]. By 1550, Portugal's only holding in Morocco was Mazagan (now [[El Jadida]]), [[Tangier]] and [[Ceuta]]. As Morocco became less important to the Portuguese, they turned their attention to India and Brazil.

The story of the Portuguese presence (from the installation in 1505 until their defeat on 12 March 1541) is described in a manuscript (published for the first time, with a French translation by [[Pierre de Cenival]], in 1934) entitled "Este He O Origem e Comeco e Cabo da Villa de Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gue D'Agoa de Narba", written by an anonymous author who was captured in 1934{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} and was imprisoned for five years in [[Taroudannt]] (cf. "Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gue d'Agoa de Narba – Estudo e Crónica", Joao Marinho e Santos, José Manuel Azevedo e Silva e Mohammed Nadir, bilingual edition, Viseu 2007{{Full citation needed|date=December 2022}}).

=== Moroccan rule ===
After the Sa'di victory the site was then left unoccupied for years until Muhammad al-Shaykh's successor, [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] (r. 1557–1574), built a new fortress (or [[kasbah]]) on the hilltop.<ref name=":02" /> It was now called ''Agadir N'Ighir'' (literally: "fortified granary of the hill" in [[Shilha language|Tachelhit]].{{Efn|''Ighir'' (pronounced ''irrhir'') later meaning shoulder or height.}}

In the 17th century, during the reign of the Berber dynasty of [[Tazerwalt]], Agadir was a harbour of some importance, expanding its trade with Europe. There was, however, neither a real port nor a wharf. Agadir traded mainly in sugar, wax, copper, hides and skins.<ref>Charles-André Julien, ''History of North Africa'', Paris, 1994 (Fr)</ref> In exchange, Europeans sold their manufactured goods there, particularly weapons and textiles. Under the reign of Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]] (1645–1727) and his successors, the trade with France, which had previously been an active partner, diminished, and trade with the English and Dutch increased.

[[Image:Agadir porte Kasbah 0085.JPG|thumb|The entrance of the Kasbah]]
In 1731, the town was completely destroyed by an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_02_29.php |title=Historic Earthquakes |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |access-date=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508031843/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_02_29.php |archive-date=8 May 2012}}</ref> After that, Agadir's harbour was ordered to be closed, and an alternative, [[Essaouira]], was established farther north.

After a long period of prosperity during the reigns of the Saadian and Alawite dynasties, Agadir declined from 1760 because of the pre-eminence given to the competing port of Essaouira by the Alawite Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] who wanted to punish the Souss for rebelling against his authority. This decline lasted a century and a half. In 1789, a European traveler gave a brief description of Agadir: "It is now a ghost town, there are no more than a few houses and these are crumbling into ruins".

In 1881, Sultan [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hassan]] reopened the harbour to trade in order to supply the expeditions he planned in the south. These expeditions, which were to reassert his authority over the Souss tribes and counter the plans of English and Spanish, were held in 1882 and 1886.<ref>{{cite book |author=Maurice Barbier |title=Le conflit du Sahara occidental |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gyx8UA0oRfoC&pg=PA48 |year=1982 |publisher=Harmattan |language=fr |isbn=978-2-85802-197-0 |page=48}}</ref>

In 1884, [[Charles de Foucauld]] described in ''Reconnaissance au Maroc'' (Reconnaissance in Morocco) his rapid passage to Agadir from the east:

{{blockquote|I walk along the shore to Agadir Irir. The road passes below the city, half-way between it and Founti: Founti is a miserable hamlet, a few fishermen's huts; Agadir, despite its white enclosure which gives it the air of a city is, I am told, a poor village depopulated and without trade.<ref>Charles de Foucauld, ''Reconnaissance au Maroc,(1883–1884)'', éd. L'Harmattan, coll. "Les Introuvables", Paris, (réimp. 2000) {{ISBN|978-2-7384-6645-7}} (in French)</ref>}}

On the pretext of a call for help from German companies in the valley of the Souss, Germany decided on 1 July 1911, to extend its interests in Morocco and assert a claim on the country. It sent to the bay of Agadir, (which harbour was, until 1881, closed to foreign trade) the {{SMS|Panther}} which was quickly joined by the cruiser ''Berlin''. Very strong international reaction, particularly from Great Britain, surprised Germany and triggered the [[Agadir Crisis]] between France and Germany. War threatened. After tough negotiations, a Franco-German treaty was finally signed on 4 November 1911, giving a free hand to France, who would be able to establish its [[protectorate]] over Morocco in return for giving up some colonies in Africa. It was only then that the gunboat ''Panther'' and the cruiser ''Berlin'' left the bay of Agadir. Due to a miscalculation, the German sales representative [[Hermann Wilberg]], who was sent to provide the pretext for the intervention, only arrived at Agadir three days after the ''Panther'' arrived.

In 1913, the cities (Agadir N'Ighir and Founti) totaled less than a thousand inhabitants. On 15 June 1913 French troops landed in Agadir. In 1916, the first pier was built near Founti – a simple jetty, later known as the "Portuguese jetty", which remained until the end of the 20th century. After 1920, under the French protectorate, a port was built and the city saw its first development with the construction of the old Talborjt district located on the plateau at the foot of the hill. Two years later, beside Talborjt along the faultline of the river Tildi construction of the popular district of Yahchech began.

Around 1930, Agadir was an important stop for the French airmail service [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]] and was frequented by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|Saint-Exupéry]] and [[Jean Mermoz|Mermoz]].

In the years from 1930, a modern central city began to be built according to the plans of the urban planner [[Henri Prost]], director of the Urban Planning Department of the Protectorate, and his deputy [[Albert Laprade]]: a horseshoe layout based on the waterfront<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k377753/f369.r=tome+39.langEN Scheme of the Future City] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726194000/https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k377753/f369.r=tome+39.langEN |date=26 July 2020 }} in the magazine ''La Géographie'' on Gallica</ref> around a large avenue perpendicular to the waterfront – the Avenue Lyautey, since renamed Avenue du Général Kettani. In the 1950s, urban development continued under the direction of the Director of Urban Planning Morocco, Michel Ecochard.

After 1950 and the opening of the new commercial port, the city grew with fishing, canning, agriculture, and mining. It also began to open up to tourism due to its climate and hotel infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} Several years later from 1950 to 1956 Agadir organized the {{ill|Grand Prix of Agadir|fr|Grand Prix automobile d'Agadir}} and, from 1954 to 1956, the [[Moroccan Grand Prix]].

In 1959, the port was visited by the yacht of the Greek shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]] and his guest, [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>[http://www.communautejuiveagadir.com/index.php?page=la-visite-de-churchill-a-agadir The visit of Winston Churchill to Agadir] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630014543/http://www.communautejuiveagadir.com/index.php?page=la-visite-de-churchill-a-agadir |date=30 June 2013 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

By 1960, Agadir numbered over 40,000 residents when at 15 minutes to midnight on 29 February 1960, it was again almost totally destroyed by an [[1960 Agadir earthquake|earthquake]] of magnitude 5.7 on the Richter scale that lasted 15 seconds, burying the city and killing more than a third of the population.<ref name="bensimon">[http://www.nfb.ca/film/once_agadir Documentary film, Jacques Bensimon, Once Agadir] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107051142/http://www.nfb.ca/film/once_agadir/ |date=7 November 2010 }}, [[National Film Board of Canada]], consulted 1 November 2010</ref> The death toll was estimated at 15,000.<ref>[http://www.agadir1960.com/ Website dedicated to the Earthquake at Agadir in 1960] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825162442/http://www.agadir1960.com/ |date=25 August 2006 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The earthquake destroyed the old Kasbah.

Agadir was the premier sardine port in the world in the 1980s and has a beach stretching over 10&nbsp;km with fine seafront promenades. Its climate has 340 days of sunshine per year which allows for swimming all year round. The winter is warm and in summer, haze is common.

With Marrakech, Agadir is a very important centre for tourism to Morocco, and the city is the most important fishing port in the country. Business is also booming with the export of citrus fruit and vegetables produced in the fertile valley of [[Souss]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

===New Talborjt===
This area is named after the old district of Talborjt (meaning "small fort" in local Berber, in remembrance of the [[water tower]] which was first built on the plateau in the former Talborjt). Lively, the New Talborjt which has been rebuilt away from the Old Talborjt, has as the main artery the Boulevard Mohammed Sheikh Saadi, named after the victor against the Portuguese in 1541. Other major avenues are the Avenue President Kennedy and the Avenue 29 February. There is also the Mohammed V mosque, the [[Olhão Garden|Olhão garden]] ([[Olhão]] is a coastal city in southern Portugal that is twinned with Agadir), and its memorial museum and the Garden Ibn Zaydoun. Some good hotels and restaurants have been built on the main arteries.

===Residential districts===
* '''Swiss Village''': the oldest district of villas bordered by the Avenue of FAR (Royal Armed Forces), Avenue Mokhtar Soussi, Cairo Avenue, and the Avenue of the United Nations.
* '''Mixed Sector District (THE NEW IHCHACH)''': the French and Spanish Consulates are in this district.
* '''Founty''' or "Bay of palm trees": a seaside area with residential villas, large hotels, holiday homes, and the royal palace.
* '''High Founty''': a new district of buildings and residential villas, located in the new city centre between the new Court of Appeal and the Marjane supermarket.
* '''Illigh''': to the east in front of the Hassan II hospital, is a residential area of large villas, housing the "new bourgeoisie".
* '''Charaf''': The Hassan II hospital is in this district.
* '''Les Amicales''': also known as the "city of government employees"
* '''Dakhla''': close to the [[Ibn Zohr University]], it has a mix between modern buildings, ordinary villas, and studio apartments. This new town created in 1979 was the last work before his death of the renowned French urbanist, Gérald Hanning.
* '''Hay Mohammadi''': a new urbanization zone in Agadir with a villa zone and a zone for large groups of buildings to frame the extension of the Avenue des FAR in the northwest.
* '''Adrar City''': a new district next to the Metro hypermarket.
* '''Other neighbourhoods''': Amsernat, Lakhyam, Erac Bouargane, Massira , Essalam, Tilila, Tassila, Bensergao, Riad Assalam, Islane, Ihchach (Yachech) Nahda, Anza, Assaka, Bir Anzarane, Tikouine, Zaitoune, Taddart and El Houda.

===The Casbah===
[[File:Agadir Kasbah 1000.JPG|thumb|Hill of the old Casbah of [[Agadir Oufla]]]]
[[File:Agadir Casbah Oufella nuit.JPG|thumb|[[Agadir Oufla]] at Night]]

The ''Casbah'' (''[[Agadir Oufla]]'', ''Agadir le haut'', ''Agadir N'Ighir'', or ''Agadir de la colline'') was, along with Founti by the sea, the oldest district of Agadir. An authentic fortress with winding streets and lively, the Casbah was built in 1572 by [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]]. Above the front door; today, the original inscription in Arabic and in English reads: "God, the Nation, the King."

Of this fortress there remains, after the earthquake of 29 February 1960, a restored long high wall that surrounds land that is not buildable. There is, however, a view over the bay of Agadir and the ports. The old people of Agadir remember the "Moorish café" of the Casbah and its panoramic view.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The hill bears the inscription in Arabic: "God, Country, King" which, like the walls, is illuminated at night.

===Old Talborjt===
Overlooking the waterfront and Wadi Tildi, this old district (whose name is sometimes spelled ''Talbordjt'') was once a shopping area and very lively with its large square where there was a weekly market, hotels, schools, mosque.<ref>[http://talborjt1930-1960.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.html Talborjt 1930–1960] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112030610/http://talborjt1930-1960.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.html |date=12 January 2014 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> 90% of the buildings in Old Talborjt were destroyed or severely damaged by the earthquake in 1960. Razed to the ground after the earthquake and now overgrown, it is classified as non-buildable area. Its main thoroughfare, the Avenue El Moun stretches over {{convert|2|km|mi}} and serves only for driving schools that teach their students to drive.

===Souk El Had===
This is the largest market in the region. It has about 6,000 small shops. It is surrounded by walls and has several entrances. It is organized into different sectors: furniture, crafts, clothing, vegetables, meat, spices etc. It is possible to find all kinds of handicrafts and traditional decorations.

The walls have been restored and the interior design is being finished.

===La Médina===
[[File:Medina Agadir2.jpg|thumb|La Médina.]]

''La Médina'' is a handicrafts space created in 1992 by the Italian artist Coco Polizzi, at Ben Sergao, a district close to Agadir {{convert|4.5|km|mi}} from the city centre. Built using techniques of traditional Berber construction, it is a kind of small open-air museum, on five hectares and home to artisan workshops, a museum, individual residences, a small hotel, and an exotic garden.

===Subdivisions===
The prefecture is divided administratively into communes.<ref name="Pop">{{cite web |url=http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 2004 |publisher=Haut-commissariat au Plan, Lavieeco.com |access-date=22 April 2012 |language=Fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724191316/http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2012}} {{in lang|ar}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Agadir coucher soleil 0992.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset in Agadir]]
Agadir has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh'') with warm summers and mild winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Agadir has a very mild climate. The daytime temperature generally stays in the 20s °C (70s&nbsp;°F) every day with averages around {{convert|27|C|F}}, with the winter highs typically reaching {{convert|21|C|F}} in January.

Rainfall is almost entirely confined to the winter months and is heavily influenced by [[North Atlantic Oscillation|the NAO]], with negative NAO indices producing wet winters and positive NAO correlating with drought. For instance, in the wettest month on record of December 1963, as much as {{convert|314.7|mm|inch|2|disp=or}} fell, whereas in the positive NAO year from July 1960 to June 1961 a mere {{convert|46.7|mm|inch|2|disp=or}} occurred over the twelve months.<ref name="Explorer">Climate Explorer; [http://climexp.knmi.nl/data/tspa60250.txt AGADIR monthly precipitation]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The wettest year has been from July 1955 to June 1956 with {{convert|455.5|mm|inch|2|disp=or}}.<ref name="Explorer"/>

Occasionally however, the region experiences winds from the Sahara called ''[[Chergui (wind)|Chergui]]'', which may exceptionally and for two to five days raise the heat above {{convert|40|C}}. The confirmed record high temperature was {{convert|50.4|C|F}} set on 12 August 2023.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?lang=en&ind=60250&ndays=31&ano=2023&mes=08&day=31&hora=00&ord=REV&Send=Send |title=Synop report summary - 60250: Agadir (Morocco) |publisher=Ogimet |access-date=7 October 2023 |archive-date=12 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231012120910/https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?lang=en&ind=60250&ndays=31&ano=2023&mes=08&day=31&hora=00&ord=REV&Send=Send |url-status=live }}</ref> This makes Agadir one of few coastal locations in the world to have recorded a temperature above 50&nbsp;°C. The record of 51.7&nbsp;°C degrees, which was on 19 August 1940, is disputed.

In 1950, a poster from the Navigation Company Pacquet proclaimed: "Winter or summer, I bathe in Agadir".<ref>[http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj9ogzhbvd1qz5q5oo1_500.jpg "Winter or summer, I bathe in Agadir"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026063327/http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj9ogzhbvd1qz5q5oo1_500.jpg |date=26 October 2014 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>
