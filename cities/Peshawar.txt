Peshawar was then ruled by the [[Hephthalites]], followed by the [[Hindu Shahis]], before the arrival of a variety of [[Islamic rulers in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim empires]]. The city was an important trading Centre of the [[Mughal Empire]] before becoming part of the [[Durrani Empire]] in 1747, after which it served as the Durrani winter capital from 1776 until the capture of the city by the [[Sikh Empire]] in 1823. In 1849, the city was captured by the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and subsequently became part of [[British Raj]], under whose rule it remained until the [[Partition of British India]] and subsequent independence of Pakistan in 1947.

Islam is believed to have been first introduced to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and other indigenous inhabitants of Puruṣapura in the later seventh century.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Peshawar}}
With an influence from the local steppe climate, Peshawar features a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh''), with very hot, prolonged summers and brief, mild to cool winters. Winter in Peshawar starts in November and ends in late March, though it sometimes extends into mid-April, while the summer months are from mid-May to mid-September. The mean maximum summer temperature surpasses {{cvt|40|C|F}} during the hottest month, and the mean minimum temperature is {{cvt|25|C|F}}. The mean minimum temperature during the coolest month is {{cvt|4|C|F}}, while the maximum is {{cvt|18.3|C|F}}.

Peshawar is not a [[monsoon]] region, unlike other parts of Pakistan; however, rainfall occurs in both winter and summer. Due to western disturbances, the winter rainfall shows a higher record between the months of February and April. The highest amount of winter rainfall, measuring {{cvt|236|mm|in}}, was recorded in February 2007,<ref name="Peshawar climate data">{{cite web |title=Peshawar Climate Data |url=http://www.pakmet.com.pk:80/cdpc/Climate/Peshawar_Climate_Data.txt |website=PakMet |publisher=Climate Data Processing Centre (CDPC), Pakistan Meteorological Department, Karachi. |access-date=26 June 2016 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613053333/http://www.pakmet.com.pk/cdpc/Climate/Peshawar_Climate_Data.txt |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref> while the highest summer rainfall of {{cvt|402|mm|in}} was recorded in July 2010;<ref name="Pakistan Rainfall july 2010">{{cite web |title=RAINFALL STATEMENT JULY-2010 |url=http://www.pakmet.com.pk:80/FFD/index_files/rainfalljuly10.htm |website=PakMet |publisher=Climate data Processing Centre (CDPC), Pakistan Meteorological Department, Karachi |access-date=26 June 2016 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820185911/http://www.pakmet.com.pk/FFD/index_files/rainfalljuly10.htm |archive-date=20 August 2010}}</ref> during this month, a record-breaking rainfall level of {{cvt|274|mm|in}} fell within a 24-hour period on 29 July 2010<ref name="Pakistan Rainfall july 2010" />—the previous record was {{cvt|187|mm|in}} of rain, recorded in April 2009.<ref name="Peshawar climate data" /> The average winter rainfall levels are higher than those of summer.

=== Cityscape ===
Peshawar's urban typology is similar to other ancient cities in South Asia, such as [[Lahore]], Multan and [[Delhi]] – all of which were founded near a major river, and included an old walled city, as well as a royal citadel.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tahir |first=M. Athar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uHQMAQAAMAAJ&q=peshawar+cityscape |title=Frontier Facets: Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province |date=2007 |publisher=National Book Foundation; Lahore |language=en}}</ref>

Historically, the old city of Peshawar was a heavily guarded citadel that consisted of high walls. In the 21st century, only remnants of the walls remain, but the houses and [[havelis]] continue to be structures of significance. Most of the houses are constructed of unbaked bricks, with the incorporation of wooden structures for protection against earthquakes, with many composed of wooden doors and latticed wooden balconies. Numerous examples of the city's old architecture can still be seen in areas such as [[Sethi Mohallah]]. In the old city, located in inner-Peshawar, many historic monuments and bazaars exist in the 21st century, including the Mohabbat Khan Mosque, [[Kotla Mohsin Khan]], [[Chowk Yadgar]] and the [[Qissa Khawani Bazaar]]. Due to the damage caused by rapid growth and development, the old walled city has been identified as an area that urgently requires restoration and protection.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

The walled city was surrounded by several main gates that served as the main entry points into the city — in January 2012, an announcement was made that the government plans to address the damage that has left the gates largely non-existent over time, with all of the gates targeted for restoration.<ref name="Ali">{{cite news |title=Restoring heritage: Kabuli Gate being rebuilt in old city |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/328577/restoring-heritage-kabuli-gate-being-rebuilt-in-old-city/ |access-date=13 December 2012 |newspaper=The Express Tribune |date=29 January 2012 |author=Manzoor Ali |agency=The Express Tribune News Network |archive-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427105614/http://tribune.com.pk/story/328577/restoring-heritage-kabuli-gate-being-rebuilt-in-old-city/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:City center Peshawar city.jpg|thumb|City Center Road is the major trade zone in Peshawar.]]
Peshawar's economic importance has historically been linked to its privileged position at the entrance to the [[Khyber Pass]] – the ancient travel route by which most trade between Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent passed. Peshawar's economy also benefited from tourism in the mid-20th century, as the city formed a crucial part of the [[Hippie trail]].

Peshawar's estimated monthly per capita income was ₨55,246 in 2015,<ref name="SPDC" /> compared to ₨117,924 in [[Islamabad]],<ref name="SPDC" /> and ₨66,359 in [[Karachi]].<ref name="SPDC" /> Peshawar's surrounding region is also relatively poor − Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's cities on average have an urban per capita income that is 20% less than Pakistan's national average for urban residents.<ref name="SPDC">{{cite web |url=http://www.spdc.org.pk/Data/Publication/PDF/AR2014-15.pdf |title=SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN PAKISTAN ANNUAL REVIEW 2014–15 |year=2016 |publisher=SOCIAL POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT CENTRE |access-date=8 April 2017 |archive-date=5 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200405051228/https://www.spdc.org.pk/Data/Publication/PDF/AR2014-15.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Peshawar was noted by the [[World Bank]] in 2014 to be at the helm of a nationwide movement to create an ecosystem for entrepreneurship, freelance jobs, and technology.<ref>{{cite news |title=Putting Peshawar at the Helm of Digital Change: Youth, Technology, and Innovation |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/05/23/putting-peshawar-at-the-helm-of-digital-change |access-date=7 April 2017 |publisher=World Bank |date=23 May 2014 |archive-date=7 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407144251/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/05/23/putting-peshawar-at-the-helm-of-digital-change |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has been host to the World Bank assisted [http://digitalyouthsummit.pk/ Digital Youth Summit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407144301/http://digitalyouthsummit.pk/ |date=7 April 2017 }} — an annual event to connect the city and province's youths to opportunities in the [[digital economy]].

=== Industry ===
Peshawar's Industrial Estate on Jamrud Road is an industrial zone established in the 1960s on 868 acres. The industrial estate hosts furniture, marble industries, and food processing industries, though many of its plots remain underutilized.<ref>{{cite book |last1=IBP, Inc. |title=Pakistan: Doing Business and Investing in Pakistan: Strategic, Practical Information, Regulations, Contacts |date=1 June 2015 |publisher=Lulu |isbn=978-1-5145-2747-4}}</ref> The Hayatabad Industrial Estate hosts 646 industrial units in Peshawar's western suburbs, though several of the units are no longer in use.<ref name="CPEC-inspired economic zones">{{cite news |title=CPEC-inspired economic zones |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1228970 |access-date=7 April 2017 |work=Dawn |date=28 December 2015 |archive-date=6 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106221227/https://www.dawn.com/news/1228970 |url-status=live }}</ref> As part of the [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]], 4 [[special economic zone]]s are to be established in the province, with roads, electricity, gas, water, and security to be provided by the government.<ref name="CPEC-inspired economic zones" /> The nearby Hattar SEZ is envisioned to provide employment to 30,000 people,<ref name="CPEC-inspired economic zones" /> and is being developed at a cost of approximately $200 million with completion expected in 2017.<ref name="CPEC-inspired economic zones" />

=== Employment ===
As a result of large numbers of displaced persons in the city, only 12% of Peshawar's residents were employed in the formalized economy in 2012.<ref name="tribune.com.pk" /> Approximately 41% of residents in 2012 were employed in personal services,<ref name="tribune.com.pk" /> while 55% of Afghan refugees in the city in 2012 were daily wage earners.<ref name="tribune.com.pk" /> By 2016, Pakistan adopted a policy to repatriate Afghan refugees.

Wages for unskilled workers in Peshawar grew on average 9.1% per year between 2002 and 2008.<ref name="SPDC" /> Following the outbreak of widespread Islamist violence in 2007, wages rose only 1.5% between 2008 and 2014.<ref name="SPDC" /> Real wages dropped for some skilled craftsmen during the period between 2008 and 2014.<ref name="SPDC" />

=== Constraints ===
Peshawar's economy has been negatively impacted by political instability since 1979 resulting from the [[War in Afghanistan]] and subsequent strain on Peshawar's infrastructure from the influx of refugees.<ref name="tribune.com.pk" /> The poor security environment resulting from Islamist violence also impacted the city's economy.

== Transportation ==
=== Road ===

[[File:Phase 3 Chowk.jpg|thumb|New [[Overpass|flyovers]], such as this one near the suburb of [[Hayatabad]], have been constructed in recent years to improve traffic flow.]]
Peshawar's east–west growth axis is centred on the historic [[Grand Trunk Road]] that connects Peshawar to [[Islamabad]] and [[Lahore]]. The road is roughly paralleled by the [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M-1 Motorway]] between Peshawar and Islamabad, while the [[M-2 motorway (Pakistan)|M-2 Motorway]] provides an alternate route to Lahore from Islamabad. The Grand Trunk Road also provides access to the Afghan border via the [[Khyber Pass]], with onwards connections to [[Kabul]] and [[Central Asia]] via the [[Salang Pass]].

Peshawar is to be completely encircled by the [[Peshawar Ring Road]] in order to divert traffic away from the city's congested centre. The road is currently under construction, with some portions open to traffic.

The [[Karakoram Highway]] provides access between the Peshawar region and western China, and an alternate route to Central Asia via [[Kashgar]] in the Chinese region of [[Xinjiang]].

The [[Indus Highway]] provides access to points south of Peshawar, with a terminus in the southern port city of [[Karachi]] via [[Dera Ismail Khan]] and northern [[Sindh]]. The {{cvt|1.9|km|mi|1}} [[Kohat Tunnel]] south of Peshawar provides access to the city of [[Kohat]] along the Indus Highway.

==== Motorways ====

Peshawar is connected to [[Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]] by the 155 kilometre long [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M-1 Motorway]]. The motorway also links Peshawar to major cities in the province, such as [[Charsadda]] and [[Mardan]]. The M-1 motorway continues onwards to [[Lahore]] as part of the [[M-2 motorway (Pakistan)|M-2 motorway]].

Pakistan's motorway network links Peshawar to Faisalabad by the [[M4 motorway (Pakistan)|M-4 Motorway]], while a new motorway network to [[Karachi]] is being built as part of the [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]].

The [[E35 expressway (Pakistan)|Hazara Motorway]] is being constructed as part of CPEC, and is providing control-access motorway travel all the way to [[Mansehra]] and [[Thakot]] via the M-1 and Hazara Motorways.

=== Rail ===
[[Peshawar Cantonment railway station]] serves as the terminus for Pakistan's {{cvt|1687|km|mi}}-long [[Karachi–Peshawar Railway Line|Main Line-1]] railway that connects the city to the port city of [[Karachi]] and passes through the [[Peshawar City railway station]]. The Peshawar to Karachi route is served by the ''[[Awam Express]]'', ''[[Khushhal Khan Khattak Express]]'', and the ''[[Khyber Mail (passenger train)|Khyber Mail]]'' services.

The entire Main Line-1 railway track between Karachi and Peshawar is to be overhauled at a cost of $3.65&nbsp;billion for the first phase of the project,<ref>{{cite web |title=Purchase of power: payments to Chinese companies to be facilitated through revolving fund |website=Business Recorder |access-date=6 December 2015 |date= December 5, 2015 |url=https://www.brecorder.com/news/4356623 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240314195201/https://www.brecorder.com/news/4356623 |archive-date= Mar 14, 2024 }}</ref> with completion by 2021.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pakistan to get Chinese funds for upgrading rail links, building pipeline |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/pakistan-to-get-chinese-funds-for-upgrading-rail-links-building-pipeline/story-pI5fBFrrL6tEuJRe0m3v2O.html |first1=Imtiaz |last1=Ahmad  |access-date=9 August 2016 |work=Hindustan Times |date=10 June 2016 |quote=The project is planned to be completed in two phases in five years by 2021.

Peshawar was also once the terminus of the ''[[Khyber train safari]]'', a tourist-oriented train that provided rail access to [[Landi Kotal]]. The service was discontinued as the security situation west of Peshawar deteriorated with the beginning of the region's Taliban insurgency.

=== Air ===

Peshawar is served by the [[Bacha Khan International Airport]], located in the [[Peshawar Cantonment]]. The airport served 1,255,303 passengers between 2014 and 2015,<ref name="caapakistan.com.pk">"[http://www.caapakistan.com.pk/AT/AT-EO-Stats.aspx Statistical Information of CAA Pakistan]", [[CAA Pakistan]], updated on 14 March 2016. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326084634/http://caapakistan.com.pk/AT/AT-EO-Stats.aspx |date=26 March 2016 }}.</ref> the vast majority of whom were international travelers.<ref name="caapakistan.com.pk" /> The airport offers direct flights throughout Pakistan, as well as to [[Bahrain]], [[Malaysia]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

=== Politics ===
Peshawar has historically served as the political centre of the region, and is currently the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The city and province have been historically regarded to be strongholds of the [[Awami National Party]] – a secular [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing]] and moderate-nationalist party.<ref name="Rug Pandits, Yasir">{{cite web |last1=Sheikh |first1=Yasir |title=Areas of political influence in Pakistan: right-wing vs left-wing |url=http://rugpundits.com/2012/11/05/areas-of-political-influence-in-pakistan-right-wing-vs-left-wing/ |website=rugpundits.com |publisher=Rug Pandits, Yasir |access-date=29 May 2015 |location=Karachi, Sindh |date=5 November 2012 |archive-date=30 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530024013/http://rugpundits.com/2012/11/05/areas-of-political-influence-in-pakistan-right-wing-vs-left-wing/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Rug Pandits, Yasir Sheikh">{{cite web |last1=Sheikh |first1=Yasir |title=Political spectrum of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) – Part I: ANP, PPP & MMA |url=http://rugpundits.com/2013/02/09/political-spectrum-of-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-kp-part-i-anp-ppp-mma/. |website=rugpundits.com |publisher=Rug Pandits, Yasir Sheikh |access-date=29 May 2015 |location=Islamabad |date=9 February 2013 |archive-date=30 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530053654/http://rugpundits.com/2013/02/09/political-spectrum-of-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-kp-part-i-anp-ppp-mma/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] had also enjoyed considerable support in the province due to its [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialist agenda]].<ref name="Rug Pandits, Yasir" />
