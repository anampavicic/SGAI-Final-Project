Krajewski, ''Opole: Urząd Miasta Opola'', ISBN 978-83-87401-04-7</ref>}} is a city located in southern [[Poland]] on the [[Oder River]] and the historical capital of [[Upper Silesia]]. With a population of approximately 127,387 as of the 2021 census,<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{cite web | url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/poland/opolskie/admin/ | title=Poland: Opole Voivodeship (Counties and Communes) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map }}</ref> it is the capital of [[Opole Voivodeship]] (province) and the seat of [[Opole County]]. Its built-up (or metro area) was home to 146,522 inhabitants. It is the largest city in its province.

Its history dates to the 8th century, and Opole is one of the oldest cities in Poland. An important stronghold in Poland, it became a capital of a [[Duchy of Opole|duchy]] within medieval Poland in 1172, and in 1217 it was granted [[city rights]] by Duke [[Casimir I of Opole]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapofpoland.net/Opole,description.html|title=Opole - description, location, history|website=Mapofpoland.net|access-date=26 October 2017}}</ref> the great-grandson of Polish Duke [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]]. During the [[Medieval Period]] and the [[Renaissance]], the city was known as a centre of commerce; several main trade routes intersected here, which helped to generate steady profits from transit trade. The rapid development of the town was also caused by the establishment of a seat of regency in Opole in 1816. The first railway connection between Opole, [[Brzeg]] and [[Wrocław]] was opened in 1843 and the first manufacturing plants were constructed in 1859, which greatly contributed to the city's regional significance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/opole/3,local-history/ |title=Local history - Information about the town - Opole - Virtual Shtetl |access-date=2016-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009174246/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/opole/3,local-history/ |archive-date=2016-10-09 }}</ref>

The city's extensive heritage entails several cultures of Central Europe, as it was under periods of Polish, [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian (Czech)]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]], and German rule. Opole formally became part of Poland again in 1945 after the end of World War II. Many [[Germans|German]] Upper Silesians and Poles of ethnic [[Germany|German]] ancestry still reside in the Opole region; but, following the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|1945–46 expulsions]], in the city of the 21st century, ethnic Germans make up less than 3% of the population.

There are four higher education establishments in the city: the [[Opole University]], [[Opole University of Technology]], a Medical College and the private Higher College of Management and Administration. [[National Festival of Polish Song in Opole|The National Festival of Polish Song]] has been held here annually since 1963. Each year new regular events, fairs, shows and competitions take place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poland.travel/en-gb/cities/opole-history-and-song-festivals |title=Opole – history and song festivals |first=Agata |last=Witosławska |website=Poland.travel |access-date=26 October 2017}}</ref>

Opole is sometimes referred to as "Polish Venice",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studiowac.pl/2235/studia-w-opolu-polska-wenecja-moze-zaoferowac-wam-nie-tylko-wspaniale-widoki-ale-takze-cudowna-atmosfere/|title=Studia w Opolu.

==Names and etymology==
The name ''Opole'' likely originated from [[Opole (administrative)|the medieval Slavic term for a group of settlements]].<ref name=slowgeo>[http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_VII/560 Opole], ''Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich'', Tom VII, nakł.

==History==
===In Medieval Poland===
[[File:Opole, rokonstrukcja grodu X-XII w.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary model of the early medieval Polish stronghold in Opole]]
[[File:Opole 0011 - mury przy Katedrze Świętego Krzyża.jpg|thumb|left|A fragment of [[medieval]] defensive walls that once surrounded Opole]]
Opole's history begins in the 8th century. At this time, according to the archeological excavations,<ref>B. Gediga, ''Początki i rozwój wczesnośredniowiecznego ośrodka miejskiego na Ostrówku w Opolu'', [[Slavia Antiqua]] t. 16, Wrocław 1970.</ref> the first settlement was founded on the Ostrówek – the northern part of the Pasieka Island in the middle of the [[Oder River|Oder river]]. In the early 10th century it developed into one of the main "[[Gord (archaeology)|gords]]" of the [[Lechites|Lechitic]] (Polish) [[Opolans]] tribe.

At the end of the century [[Silesia]] became part of Poland and was ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]]; the land of the pagan Opolanie was conquered by Duke [[Mieszko I]] in 992. From the 11th–12th centuries it was also a [[castellany]]. After the death of Duke [[Władysław II the Exile]], Silesia was divided in 1163 between two Piast lines – the [[Wrocław]] line in [[Lower Silesia]] and the Opole-[[Racibórz]] of Upper Silesia. Opole would [[Duchy of Opole|become a duchy]] in 1172 and would share much in common with the [[Duchy of Racibórz]], with which it was often combined. In 1281 Upper Silesia was divided further between the heirs of the dukes. The Duchy of Opole was temporarily reestablished in 1290.

In the early 13th century, Duke [[Casimir I of Opole]] decided to move the settlement from the Pasieka Island to the right shore of the Oder river (since the 17th century, the old [[stream bed]] of the Oder, known as the Młynówka). All of the inhabitants had to be moved in order to accommodate the castle that was built in place of the old city.<ref name="Opole - Monografia miasta">W. Dziewulski, F. Hawranek, ''Opole - Monografia miasta'', [[Silesian Institute in Opole|Instytut Śląski]] Opole 1975, p. 57.</ref> Former inhabitants of Ostrówek, together with German merchants that immigrated from the West, received the first town rights probably as early as around 1217, although this date is disputed.<ref>This opinion is shared i.e. by W. Dziewulski, F. Hawranek, ''Opole - Monografia miasta'', [[Silesian Institute in Opole|Instytut Śląski]] Opole 1975, p. 57 and G. A. Stenzel, ''Geschichte Schlesiens'', T1. 1, Breslau 1853, p. 41. The opposite opinion is presented i.e. by K. Buczek, ''Targi i miasta na prawie polskim (okres wczesnośredniowieczny)'', Wrocław 1964, p. 114.</ref> Opole received [[German town law]] in 1254, which was expanded with Neumarkt law in 1327. Opole developed during the rule of duke [[Bolko I of Opole]]. The castle was finally completed around this time and new buildings, including the [[city walls]] and the Holy Cross Church, were constructed.

[[File:Oppeln 1535.jpg|thumb|The oldest known view of Opole seen from southeast, circa 1535]]

Along with most of [[Silesia]], in 1327 the Duchy of Opole came under the sovereignty of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], itself part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1521 the Duchy of Opole inherited the Duchy of [[Racibórz]] (''Ratibor''), by then also known by its German equivalent – Oppeln. The second castle of Opole was probably founded in the 14th century by duke [[Vladislaus II of Opole|Vladislaus II]], though some sources claim that it was originally a wooden stronghold of Opole's [[castellan]] dating into 12th century.<ref name="Opole - Monografia miasta p. 58–60">W. Dziewulski, F. Hawranek, ''Opole - Monografia miasta'', [[Silesian Institute in Opole|Instytut Śląski]] Opole 1975, pp. 58–60.</ref>

===Austrian Habsburgs and Polish Vasas rule===
With the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Ludvík II]] of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] at the [[Battle of Mohács]], Silesia was inherited by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], placing Opole under the sovereignty of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] of [[Austria]]. The Habsburgs took control of the region in 1532 after the last Piast duke of Opole, [[Jan II the Good]], died. At that time the city was still mainly Polish-speaking (around 63%), with other nationalities represented mainly by Germans, Czechs and Jews.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} The last two dukes of Opole, [[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]] and Janusz II the Good, did not master the German language.<ref name="Opole - Monografia miasta p.78">W. Dziewulski, F. Hawranek, ''Opole - Monografia miasta'', [[Silesian Institute in Opole|Instytut Śląski]] Opole 1975, p.78.</ref>

Beginning in 1532 the Habsburgs pawned the duchy to different rulers including several [[monarchs of Poland]] (see [[Dukes of Opole]]). After the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]], in 1655 the King of Poland, [[John II Casimir Vasa]], stayed with his entire court in Opole. In Opole in November 1655, the [[Universal (act)|Universal]] of Opole (''Uniwersał opolski'') was issued by the King, calling for Poles to rise against the Swedes, who at that time occupied a large part of Poland.
[[File:Oppeln F.B. Werner.png|thumb|18th-century view of Opole]]
With the abdication of King [[John II Casimir]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] as the last Duke of Opole in 1668, the region passed to the direct control of the Habsburgs. At the beginning of the 18th century, the German population of Opole was estimated at 20%.<ref name="Opole - Monografia miasta p.159">W. Dziewulski, F. Hawranek, ''Opole - Monografia miasta'', [[Silesian Institute in Opole|Instytut Śląski]] Opole 1975, p.159.</ref>

===In Prussian Silesia===
King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] conquered most of Silesia from Austria in 1740 during the [[Silesian Wars]]; Prussian control was confirmed in the [[Peace of Breslau]] in 1742. In the 18th century, Opole belonged to the tax inspection region of [[Prudnik]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-16 |title=Historia Powiatu Prudnickiego - Starostwo Powiatowe w Prudniku |url=http://www.powiatprudnicki.pl/powiatprudnicki-historiapowiatu.html |access-date=2021-12-07 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116133028/http://www.powiatprudnicki.pl/powiatprudnicki-historiapowiatu.html |archive-date=16 November 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Under Prussian rule the ethnic structure of the city began to change. In the early 20th century the number of Polish and bilingual citizens of Opole, according to the official German statistics, varied between 25% and 31%.<ref name="Opole - Monografia miasta p. 263–268">W. Dziewulski, F. Hawranek, ''Opole - Monografia miasta'', [[Silesian Institute in Opole|Instytut Śląski]] Opole 1975, p. 263–268".</ref> Nonetheless, Opole remained an important cultural, social and political center for the Poles of Upper Silesia. From 1849 the Polish newspaper ''Gazeta Wiejska dla Górnego Śląska'' was published in Opole. Polish reporter and opponent of [[Germanisation]] [[Bronisław Koraszewski]] founded the newspaper ''Gazeta Opolska'' in 1890 and the People's Bank in Opole (''Opolski Bank Ludowy'') in 1897.<ref>T. Hunt Tooley, ''National Identity and Weimar Germany. Upper Silesia and the Eastern Border, 1918–1922'', University of Nebraska Press, 1997, p. 15</ref> Another Polish newspaper, the ''Nowiny'' was founded by Franciszek Kurpierz in 1911.

From 1816–1945 Opole was the capital of [[Regierungsbezirk]] Oppeln within Prussia. The city became part of the [[German Empire]] during the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.

===After World War I===
[[File:1921 UpperSilesia 15 25Pfg Oppeln Opole Poland.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Stamps after the plebiscite in August 1921 featured the German name of ''Oppeln'']]
After the defeat of Imperial Germany in [[World War I]], a [[Silesian Plebiscite|plebiscite]] was held on 20 March 1921 in Oppeln to determine if the city would be in the [[Weimar Republic]] or become part of the [[Second Polish Republic]], which just regained independence. 20,816 (94.7%) votes were cast for Germany, 1,098 (5.0%) for Poland, and 70 (0.3%) votes were declared invalid. Voter participation was 95.9%. Results of the plebiscite in the Oppeln-Land county were different, with 30% of the population voting for Poland. The local newspaper ''Oppelner Nachrichten'' was published in Oppeln.

Oppeln was the administrative seat of the [[Province of Upper Silesia]] from 1919–1939. In the years 1928–1931, by the decision of the German regional administration, the Piast Castle was demolished. Thanks to the strong opposition of the local Polish community and protests of the [[Union of Poles in Germany]], the castle tower was saved from demolition.<ref>''Spotkania z Zabytkami''. 6, 2005, p. 21. (in Polish)</ref> Nowadays called the ''Piast Tower'' it is one of the city's landmarks. In 1929, a Polish theatre from [[Katowice]] came to Opole to perform the opera ''[[Halka]]'' by [[Stanisław Moniuszko]]. After the performance, the actors were brutally beaten by a German militia with the silent consent of the German police.<ref>Dorota Simonides, Jan Zaremba, ''Śląskie miscellanea: literatura-folklor'', 2006, p. 82 (in Polish)</ref>

=== World War II ===

===In modern Poland===
After the end of the Second World War in 1945, Oppeln was transferred from Germany to Poland, pursuant to the agreements of the [[Potsdam Conference]], and given its original Slavic name of Opole. Opole became part of the [[Katowice Voivodeship]] from 1946–1950, after which it became part of the [[Opole Voivodeship]]. Unlike other parts of the so-called [[Recovered Territories]], Opole and the surrounding region's indigenous population partly remained and was only partly [[expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled as elsewhere]]. Over 1 million Silesians who considered themselves Poles or were treated as such by the authorities due to their language and customs were allowed to stay after they were verified as Poles in a special verification process. It involved declaring [[Polish people|Polish nationality]] and an oath of allegiance to the Polish nation. Additionally, many Poles displaced from the former Polish [[Kresy]] annexed by the USSR (for example [[Lviv|Lwów]]) came to Opole and the surrounding area and settled here after the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/opolscy-kresowianie-wciaz-zyja-wspomnieniami-o-rodzinnych-stronach | title=Opolscy Kresowianie wciąż żyją wspomnieniami o rodzinnych stronach }}</ref> 

In the later years however many Germans (and German Silesians) left to [[West Germany]] to flee the communist [[Eastern Bloc]] (see [[Emigration from Poland to Germany after World War II]]). Today Opole, along with the surrounding region, is known as a centre of the [[German minority in Poland]] that recruits mainly from the descendants of the positively verified autochthons. In the city itself however only 2.46% of the inhabitants declared German nationality according to the last national census of 2002.

===German minority===
Alongside [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], many citizens of the city before 1945 used a strongly German-influenced [[Silesian language|Silesian]] dialect (sometimes called ''wasserpolnisch'' or ''wasserpolak''). Because of this, the post-war [[Polish People's Republic|Polish state]] administration after the annexation of Silesia in 1945 did not initiate a general [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion of all former inhabitants]] of Opole, as was done in Lower Silesia, for instance, where the population almost exclusively spoke the German language. Because they were considered "[[Autochthonous language|autochthonous]]" (Polish), the Wasserpolak-speakers instead received the right to remain in their homeland after declaring themselves as Poles. Some German speakers took advantage of this decision, allowing them to remain in Opole, even when they considered themselves to be of German nationality. The city surroundings currently contain the largest German and Upper Silesian minorities in Poland. However, Opole itself is only 2.46% German.<ref name="www2.mswia.gov.pl">{{cite web|url=http://www2.mswia.gov.pl/portal.php?serwis=pl&dzial=61&id=37#niemcy|title=German minority in Poland on the Ministry of Interior and Administration webpage|website=2.mswia.gov.pl|access-date=26 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225161545/http://www2.mswia.gov.pl/portal.php?serwis=pl&dzial=61&id=37#niemcy|archive-date=25 February 2012}}</ref> (See also [[Germans of Poland]].)
