'''Kanchipuram''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''{{transliteration|ta|ISO|kāñcipuram}}''; {{IPA-ta|kaːɲdʑipuɾam|}}){{sfn|Malalasekera| 1973| pp= 112–13}} also known as '''''Kanjeevaram''','' is a stand alone city corporation, satellite nodal city of Chennai in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]] in the [[Tondaimandalam]] region, {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} from [[Chennai]]{{spaced ndash}}the capital of Tamil Nadu. Known as the ''City of Thousand Temples'', Kanchipuram is known for its temple architectures, 1000-pillared halls, huge temple towers and [[silk]] saris. Kanchipuram serves as one of the most important inland tourist destinations in India. Kanchipuram has become a centre of attraction for foreign tourists as well. The city covers an area of {{convert|36.14|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and an estimated population of more than 13,00,000 in 2021.{{sfn|Kanchipuram : Census 2011}} It is the administrative headquarters of [[Kanchipuram District]]. Kanchipuram is well-connected by road and rail.

Kanchipuram is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name formed by combining two words, "[[Mallotus (plant)|kanchi]]" and "puram," together meaning "the city of kaanchi flowers" (due to the abundance of kaanchi flowers in those regions). The city is located on the banks of the Vegavathy and [[Palar River|Palar Rivers]]. Kanchipuram has been ruled by the [[Pallavas]], the [[Medieval Cholas]],<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Conjeeveram|volume=6|page=943}}</ref> the [[Later Cholas]], the Later [[Pandya]]s, the [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagara Empire]], the [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic kingdom]], and the [[British Raj|British]], who called the city "Conjeeveram".<ref name=EB1911/> The city's historical monuments include the [[Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasanathar Temple]] and the [[Tiru Parameswara Vinnagaram|Vaikunta Perumal Temple]]. Historically, Kanchipuram was a centre of education{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=xviii}} and was known as the ''ghatikasthanam'', or "place of learning".{{sfn|K.V.|1975|p=80}} The city was also a religious centre of advanced education for [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] between the 1st and 5th centuries.{{sfn|Thapar| 2001| pp= 344–345}}

In the [[Vaishnavism]] Hindu theology, Kanchipuram is one of the seven [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|Tirtha]] (pilgrimage) sites, for spiritual release.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jean Holm|author2=John Bowker|title=Sacred Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xlfCgAAQBAJ |year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-62356-623-4|page=70}}</ref> The city houses the [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadharaja Perumal Temple]], [[Ekambareswarar Temple (Kanchipuram)|Ekambareswarar Temple]], [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]], and [[Kumarakottam Temple]], which are some of the major Hindu temples in the state. Of the 108 holy temples of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]], 15 are located in Kanchipuram.{{sfn|Gupta|2001|p=51}}

The city is most important to [[Sri Vaishnavism]], [[Shaktism]] and then [[Shaivism]]. Most of the city's workforce is involved in the weaving industry.{{sfn|Kanchipuram Industrial profile|2012}}

Kanchipuram is administered by a Special grade municipality constituted in 1947. It is the headquarters of the [[Kanchi matha]], a Hindu monastic institution believed to have been founded by the Hindu saint and commentator [[Adi Sankaracharya]], and was the capital city of the [[Pallava Kingdom]] between the 4th and 9th centuries.

Kanchipuram has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for [[HRIDAY - Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana]] scheme of Government of India.

==Etymology==
Kanchipuram was known in early [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and Sanskrit literature as ''Kanchi'' or ''Kachipedu''.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|p=6}} In the [[Sanskrit]] the word is split into two: ka and anchi. ''Ka'' means [[Brahma]] and ''anchi'' means worship,{{cn|date=September 2023}} showing that Kanchi stands for the place where [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadharaja Perumal]] was worshipped by Brahma. Brahma has sculpted Athi Varadhar and worshipped here. In [[Sanskrit]] the term Kanci means girdle and explanation is given that the city is like a girdle to the earth.<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/39511/7/07_chapter%202.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717124910/http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/39511/7/07_chapter%202.pdf |date=17 July 2018 }} p.no 7</ref> The earliest Sanskrit inscriptions from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] (early 4th century-CE to late 5th century-CE) denote the city as ''Kanchipuram'', where King Visnugopa was defeated by Samudragupta.{{sfn|Sharma|1978|p=255}} [[Patanjali]] (150 BCE or 2nd century BCE){{cn|date=September 2023}} refers to the city in his ''Mahabhasya'' as ''Kanchipuraka''.{{sfn|Sharma|1978|p=255}} The city was referred to by various names like ''Kanchi'', ''Kanchipedu'' and ''Kanchipuram''.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|p=6}}{{sfn|Sharma|1978|p=255}} The Pallava inscriptions from (250–355) and the inscriptions of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] refer the city as [[Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham|''Kanchipura'']].{{sfn|Sharma|1978|p=255}} ''Jaina Kanchi'' refers to the area around Tiruparutti Kundram.{{sfn|Sharma|1978|p=255}} During the British rule, the city was known as ''Conjeevaram''{{sfn|Malalasekera| 1973| pp= 112–13}} and later as ''Kanchipuram''. The municipal administration was renamed ''Kancheepuram'', while the district and city retains the name ''Kanchipuram''.{{sfn|About municipality|2011}}{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}}

It finds its mention in [[Pāṇini|Pāṇini's]] [[Aṣṭādhyāyī|Ashtadhyayi]] as Kanchi-prastha and in several Puranas. It is also one of the seven cities that provides liberation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The earliest references to Kanchipuram are found in the books of the Sanskrit grammarian [[Patanjali]], who lived between the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE.{{sfn|Iyengar|1929|pp=322–333}} The city was part of the [[Dravida kingdom]] of the [[Mahabharata]]{{sfn|Iyengar|1929|pp=322–333}} and was described as "the best among cities" ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nagareshu Kanchi'') by the 4th-century Sanskrit poet, [[Kalidasa]].{{sfn|Historical Importance of Kanchipuram|2011}} The city finds mention in the classical [[Tamil language]] [[Sangam literature]] dated 300 BCE like [[Manimegalai]] and [[Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai]].<ref name=Diwakar>{{cite book|title=Temples of South India|first=Macherla|last=Diwakar|location=Chennai|year=2011|edition=1st|page=139|isbn=978-93-83440-34-4|publisher=Techno Book House}}</ref> While it is widely accepted that Kanchipuram had served as an [[Early Chola]] capital,{{sfn|Kamath|2000|p=127}}{{sfn|Hoiberg|2000}} the claim has been contested by Indian historian [[P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar]] who wrote that the Tamil culture of the Sangam period did not spread through the Kanchipuram district and cites the Sanskritic origins of its name in support of his claim.{{sfn|Iyengar|1929|pp=322–333}}

Kanchipuram grew in importance when the Pallavas, wary of constant invasions from the north, moved their capital south to the city in the 6th century.{{sfn|Pochhammer|2005|p=99}}{{sfn|Imperial Gazetteer of India|1908|pp=544–546}} The Pallavas fortified the city with ramparts, wide moats, well-laid-out roads, and artistic temples. During the reign of the Pallava King [[Mahendravarman I]], the [[Chalukya]] King [[Pulakesin II]] (610{{ndash}}642) invaded the Pallava kingdom as far as the [[Kaveri River]]. The Pallavas successfully defended Kanchipuram and foiled repeated attempts to capture the city.{{sfn|Keay|2001|p=170}} A second invasion ended disastrously for Pulakesin II, who was forced to retreat to his capital [[Vatapi]] which was besieged and Pulakesin II was killed by [[Narasimhavarman I]] (630{{ndash}}668), son of Mahendravarman I (600{{ndash}}630), at the [[Battle of Vatapi]].{{sfn|Sastri|2008|p=136}}{{sfn|Keay|2001|p=170}} Under the Pallavas, Kanchipuram flourished as a centre of Hindu and Buddhist learning. King [[Narasimhavarman II]] built the city's important Hindu temples, the [[Tiru Parameswara Vinnagaram|Vaikuntha Perumal Temple]], [[Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple]], the [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadharaja Perumal Temple]] and the [[Iravatanesvara Temple, Kanchipuram|Iravatanesvara Temple]].{{sfn|Jouveau-Dubreuil|1994|p=71}} [[Xuanzang]], a Chinese traveller who visited Kanchipuram in 640, recorded that the city was {{convert|6|miles|km}} in circumference and that its people were renowned for their bravery, piety, love of justice and veneration for learning.{{sfn|Imperial Gazetteer of India|1908|pp=544–546}}{{sfn|Smith|1914|p=473}}

The Medieval Chola king [[Aditya I]] conquered the Pallava kingdom, including Kanchipuram, after defeating the Pallava ruler [[Aparajitavarman]] (880{{ndash}}897) in about 890.{{sfn|Sastri|1935|p=113}} Under the Cholas, the city was the headquarters of the northern viceroyalty.{{sfn|Aiyangar|2004|p=60}} The province was renamed ''Jayamkonda Cholamandalam'' during the reign of King [[Raja Raja Chola I]] (985{{ndash}}1014),{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=11–26}}{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=126}} who constructed the [[Karchapeswarar Temple]] and renovated the [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]].{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=126}} His son, [[Rajendra Chola I]] (1012{{ndash}}44) constructed the [[Yathothkari Perumal Temple]].{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=127}} According to the ''Siddhantasaravali'' of Trilocana Sivacharya, Rajendra Chola I brought a band of [[Saivite|Saivas]] with him on his return from the [[Chola expedition to North India]] and settled them in Kanchipuram.{{sfn|Sastri|1935|p=210}} In about 1218, the Pandya king [[Maravarman Sundara Pandyan]] (1216{{ndash}}1238) invaded the Chola country, making deep inroads into the kingdom which was saved by the intervention of the Hoysala king [[Vira Narasimha II]] (1220{{ndash}}1235), who fought on the side of the Chola king [[Kulothunga Chola III]].{{sfn|Sastri|1935|p=420}}{{sfn|Aiyangar|2004|p=34}} Inscriptions indicate the presence of a powerful Hoysala garrison in Kanchipuram, which remained in the city until about 1230.{{sfn|Sastri|1935|p=428}} Shortly afterwards, Kanchipuram was conquered by the [[Cholas]], from whom [[Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I]] took the city in 1258.{{sfn|Aiyangar|2004|p=49}} The city remained with the Pandyas until 1311 when the Sambuvarayars declared independence, taking advantage of the anarchy caused by [[Malik Kafur]]'s invasion.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=11–26}}{{sfn|Aiyangar|2004|p=61}} After short spells of occupation by Ravivarman Kulasekhara of [[Venad]] ([[Quilon]], Kerala) in 1313{{ndash}}1314 and the [[Kakatiya Dynasty|Kakatiya]] ruler [[Prataparudra II]], Kanchipuram was conquered by the Vijayanagara general [[Kumara Kampana]], who defeated the Madurai Sultanate in 1361.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}}

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] ruled Kanchipuram from 1361 to 1645.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} The earliest inscriptions attesting to Vijayanagara rule are those of Kumara Kampanna from 1364 and 1367, which were found in the precincts of the Kailasanathar Temple and Varadharaja Perumal Temple respectively.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} His inscriptions record the re-institution of Hindu rituals in the Kailasanathar Temple that had been abandoned during the Muslim invasions.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} Inscriptions of the Vijayanagara kings [[Harihara II]], [[Deva Raya II]], [[Krishna Deva Raya]], [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], [[Sriranga I]], and [[Venkata II]] are found within the city.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} Harihara II endowed grants in favour of the Varadharaja Perumal Temple.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}}In the 15th century, Kanchipuram was invaded by the [[Velama Nayaks]] in 1437, the [[Gajapati kingdom]] in 1463{{ndash}}1465 and 1474{{ndash}}75 and the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] in about 1480.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} A 1467 inscription of [[Virupaksha Raya II]] mentions a [[cantonment]] in the vicinity of Kanchipuram.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} In 1486, [[Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya]], the governor of the Kanchipuram region, overthrew the [[Sangama Dynasty]] of Vijayanagara and founded the [[Saluva Dynasty]].{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} Like most of his predecessors, Narasimha donated generously to the Varadharaja Perumal Temple.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} Kanchipuram was visited twice by the Vijayanagara king Krishna Deva Raya, considered to be the greatest of the Vijayanagara rulers, and 16 inscriptions of his time are found in the Varadharaja Perumal Temple.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} The inscriptions in four languages{{spaced ndash}}Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Sanskrit{{spaced ndash}}record the genealogy of the [[Tuluva Dynasty|Tuluva]] kings and their contributions, along with those of their nobles, towards the upkeep of the shrine.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} His successor, Achyuta Deva Raya, reportedly had himself weighed against pearls in Kanchipuram and distributed the pearls amongst the poor.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} Throughout the second half of the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the [[Aravidu Dynasty]] tried to maintain a semblance of authority in the southern parts after losing their northern territories in the [[Battle of Talikota]].{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} [[Venkata II]] (1586{{ndash}}1614) tried to revive the Vijayanagara Empire, but the kingdom relapsed into confusion after his death and rapidly fell apart after the Vijayanagara king [[Sriranga III]]'s defeat by the Golconda and Bijapur sultanates in 1646.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}}

After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kanchipuram endured over two decades of political turmoil.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} The Golconda Sultanate gained control of the city in 1672, but lost it to Bijapur three years later.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} In 1676, Shivaji arrived in Kanchipuram at the invitation of the Golconda Sultanate in order to drive out the Bijapur forces.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} His campaign was successful and Kanchipuram was held by the Golconda Sultanate until its conquest by the [[Mughal Empire]] led by [[Aurangazeb]] in October 1687.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}}In the course of their southern campaign, the Mughals defeated the Marathas under [[Sambhaji]], the elder son of Shivaji, in a battle near Kanchipuram in 1688{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} which caused considerable damage to the city but cemented Mughal rule.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} Soon after, the priests at the Varadharaja Perumal, Ekambareshwarar and Kamakshi Amman temples, mindful of Aurangazeb's reputation for [[iconoclasm]], transported the idols to southern Tamil Nadu and did not restore them until after Aurangzeb's death in 1707.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} Under the Mughals, Kanchipuram was part of the viceroyalty of the Carnatic which, in the early 1700s, began to function independently, retaining only a nominal acknowledgement of Mughal rule.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} The Marathas ruled Kanchipuram due to Islamic invasion during the Carnatic period in 1724 and 1740, and the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1742.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|p=48}}

[[File:Rocket warfare.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Battle of Pollilur, fought near Kanchipuram in 1780|alt=painting depicting attack by modern weapon resulting in army getting blasted]]

Kanchipuram was a battlefront for the [[British East India Company]] in the [[Carnatic Wars]] against the [[French East India Company]] and in the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] with the [[Sultanate of Mysore]].{{sfn|Jaques|2007|p=257}}The popular [[Battle of Pollilur (1780)|1780 Battle of Pollilur]] of the Second Anglo-Mysore War, known for the use of rockets by [[Hyder Ali]] of Mysore, was fought in the village of [[Pullalur]] near Kanchipuram.{{sfn|R.G.|2011|p=468}} In 1763, the British East India Company assumed indirect control from the Nawab of the Carnatic over the erstwhile [[Chingleput District (Madras Presidency)|Chingleput District]], comprising the present-day Kanchipuram and [[Tiruvallur district|Tiruvallur]] districts, in order to defray the expenses of the Carnatic wars.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} The Company brought the territory under their direct control during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, and the Collectorate of Chingleput was created in 1794.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} The district was split into two in 1997 and Kanchipuram made the capital of the newly created Kanchipuram district.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}}

It is called the Clive Makarakandi and is still used to decorate the deity on ceremonial occasions.{{sfn|K.V.|1975|pp=26–39}} This temple is the main reason for the city to get its name '''Kanchi'''. In the Sanskrit the word is split into two: ka and anchi. Ka means Brahma and anchi means worship, showing that Kanchi stands for the place where '''Varadharaja Perumal''' was worshipped by Brahma. Brahma has sculpted Athi Varadhar and worshipped here.

[[Ekambareswarar Temple (Kanchipuram)|Ekambareswarar Temple]] in northern Kanchipuram, dedicated to [[Shiva]], is the largest temple in the city.{{sfn|Let's Go |2004| p= 584}} Its gateway tower, or ''gopuram'', is {{convert|59|m|ft}} tall, making it one of the tallest temple towers in India. The temple is one of five called ''[[Pancha Bhoota Stalam]]s'', which represent the manifestation of the five prime elements of nature; namely land, water, air, sky, and fire. There is also a 108 holy site of [[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu temple]] inside the Ekambaranathar temple called Chandrachuda Perumal or [[Nilathingal Thundam Perumal temple]].{{sfn|Ramaswamy| 2007| pp= 301–302}} Ekambareswarar temple represents earth.{{sfn|Ramaswamy| 2007| pp= 301–302}}

In the [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]], goddess [[Parvati]] is depicted in the form of a ''yantra'', ''Chakra'' or ''peetam'' (basement). In this temple, the ''yantra'' is placed in front of the deity.{{sfn|Ayyar| 1991| pp= 70–71}} Adi Sankara is closely associated with this temple and is believed to have established the [[Kanchi matha]] after this temple.{{sfn|Tourist places in Kanchipuram|2012}}

[[Kumarakottam Temple]], dedicated to [[Muruga]], is located between the Ekambareswarar temple and Kamakshi Amman temple, leading to the cult of [[Somaskanda]] (Skanda, the child between Shiva and Parvati). ''Kandapuranam'', the Tamil religious work on Muruga, translated from Sanskrit ''Skandapurana'', was composed in 1625 by Kachiappa Shivacharya in the temple.{{sfn|Rao| 2008| p= 110}}

The [[Kanchi Matha]] is a Hindu monastic institution, whose official history states that it was founded by [[Adi Sankara]] of [[Kaladi]], tracing its history back to the 5th century BCE.{{sfn|Saraswati|2001|p=492}}{{sfn|Dalal|2006|p=186}}{{sfn|Kuttan|Arunachalam|2009|pp=244–245}} A related claim is that Adi Sankara came to Kanchipuram, and that he established the Kanchi matha named "Dakshina Moolamnaya Sarvagnya Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam" in a position of supremacy, namely Sarvagnya Peeta, over the other mathas (religious institutions) of the subcontinent, before his death there.{{sfn|Kuttan|Arunachalam|2009|pp=244–245}}{{sfn|Sharma|1987|pp=44–46}} Other historical accounts state that the matha was established probably in the 18th century in [[Kumbakonam]], as a branch of the [[Sringeri Mutt|Sringeri Matha]], and that it declared itself independent.{{sfn|Dalal|2006|p=186}}

Another matha which was famous in ancient times was the Upanishad Bramham Mutt, located near Kailasanathar temple, Kanchipuram. It has the Mahasamadhi of [[Upanishad Brahmayogin]], a saint who wrote commentaries on all the major [[Upanishads]] in Hinduism. It is said that the great Sage, [[Sadasiva Brahmendra]] took to sanyasa at this matha.

===Buddhism===
[[File:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|200x200px|thumb|right|Bodhidharma is believed to have spread Zen school of Buddhism from India to China|alt=Drawing depicting a saint in a background of trees]]

Buddhism is believed to have flourished in Kanchipuram between the 1st and 5th centuries.{{sfn|Trainor|2001|p=13}} Some notable Buddhists associated with Kanchipuram are [[Aryadeva|Āryadeva]] (2nd–3rd centuries){{spaced ndash}}a successor of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] of [[Nalanda University]], [[Dignaga]] and the Pali commentators [[Buddhaghosa]] and [[Dhammapala]].{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=20}} According to a popular tradition, [[Bodhidharma]], a 5th/6th-century Buddhist monk and founder of [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] was the third son of a Pallava king from Kanchipuram.{{sfn|Zvelebil|1987|p=125-126}} However, other traditions ascribe his origins to other places in Asia.{{sfn|McRae|2000|p=26}} Buddhists institutions from Kanchipuram were instrumental in spreading [[Theravada Buddhism]] to the [[Mon people]] of [[Myanmar]] and Thailand who in return spread the religion to the incoming [[Demographics of Burma|Burmese]] and [[Thai people]].{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=56}}

A number of bronzes unearthed at [[Kurkihar hoard|Kurkihar]] (Apanaka Vihara, near Gaya in Bihar) mention that the majority of the donors were from Kanchi, indicating that Kurkihar was a major center for the visitors from Kanchi during 9th to 11th century,

Kanchipuram had been a major center of Jainism and is associated with several well-known Jain Acharyas like Samantabhadra and [[Akalanka]]. It is thought that Jainism was introduced into Kanchipuram by Kunda Kundacharya (1st century).{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=20}} Jainism spread to the city by [[Akalanka]] (3rd century). [[Kalabhra dynasty|Kalbhras]], the rulers of Kanchipuram before the Pallavas, followed Jainism which gained popularity from royal patronage.{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=20}} The Pallava kings, Simhavishnu, Mahendra Varman and Simhavarman (550{{ndash}}560) followed Jainism, until the advent of ''[[Nayanmars]]'' and ''[[Azhwars|Alvars]]'' during the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=20}} [[Mahendravarman I]] converted from Jainism to Hinduism under the influence of the Naynamar, [[Appar]], was the turning point in the religious geography.{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=20}} The two sects of Hinduism, [[Saivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] were revived under the influence of [[Adi Sankara]] and [[Ramanuja]] respectively.{{sfn|Ayyar|1991|p=69}}{{sfn|Smith|1914|p=468}} Later Cholas and Vijayanagara kings tolerated Jainism, and the religion was still practised in Kanchi.{{sfn|Rao|2008|p=20}}

The original set of the [[Jina Kanchi]] institution Mutt was in Kanchipuram. Its original site is now represented by the
[[Trilokyanatha Temple|Trilokyanatha/Chandraprabha temple]] at Thiruparthikundram. It is a twin Jain temple that has inscriptions from Pallava king, [[Narasimhavarman II]] and the Chola kings [[Rajendra Chola I]], [[Kulothunga Chola I]] and [[Vikrama Chola]], and the Kanarese inscriptions of [[Krishnadevaraya]]. The temple is maintained by Tamil Nadu archaeological department.{{sfn|''The Hindu''|23 June 2011}} The [[Jina Kanchi]] Mutt was later shifted to Melsithamur, near Gingee in the Villupuram district in the 16th century. There exist many historical Jain sites in the vicinity of Kanchipuram in several villages that still have some Jain population.<ref>Tamilnadu Digambar Jain Tirthakshetra Sandarshan, Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain Tirtha Samrakshini MahaSabha, 2001</ref>
