'''Khatlon Region''' ({{lang-tg|Вилояти Хатлон|Viloyati Xatlon}}), one of the four [[provinces of Tajikistan]], is the most populous of the four first-level administrative regions in the country. It is situated in the southwest of the country, between the [[Hisor Range|Hisor (Gissar) Range]] in the north and the river [[Panj (river)|Panj]] in the south and borders on [[Afghanistan]] in the southeast and on [[Uzbekistan]] in the west. During Soviet times, Khatlon was divided into [[Qurghonteppa Oblast|Kurgan-Tyube (Qurghonteppa) Oblast]] (Western Khatlon)&nbsp;– with the [[Kofarnihon]] and [[Vakhsh (river)|Vakhsh]] river valleys&nbsp;– and [[Kulob Oblast]] (Eastern Khatlon)&nbsp;– with the [[Kyzylsu (Panj)|Kyzylsu]] and ''Yakhsu'' river valleys. The two regions were merged in November 1992 into today's Khatlon Region (or ''viloyat''/''oblast''). The capital city is [[Bokhtar]], formerly known as ''Qurghonteppa'' and ''Kurgan-Tyube''.<ref>Borjian, H., “Khatlon”, Encyclopaedia Iranica. Volume 16, Issue 4, 2018, pp. 437-439.

Khatlon has an area of 24,700 square kilometres and consists of 21 districts and 4 district-level cities. The total population of Khatlon in 2020 was 3,348,300,<ref name=pop2020>{{cite web |url=http://stat.ww.tj/posts/July2020/macmua_20201.pdf |title=Population of the Republic of Tajikistan as of 1 January 2020 |publisher=Statistics office of Tajikistan |access-date=12 October 2020 |language=ru |archive-date=1 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210601101228/http://stat.ww.tj/posts/July2020/macmua_20201.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> up from 2,677,251 in the 2010 population census. The population in Khatlon is mainly engaged in [[agriculture]].

==History==
[[File:Kulyab Museum, Kulyab, Tajikistan.JPG|thumb|Tomb of [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani]]]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, Khatlon became one of the two main cotton regions in Tajikistan, along with [[Sughd]] (Leninabad). [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] of agriculture was implemented aggressively in the early 1930s, to expand cotton cultivation in Tajikistan as a whole, with particular emphasis on the southern part of the republic. The process included violations against peasants, substantial expansion of the [[irrigation]] network, and forcible resettlement of mountain peoples and people from [[Uzbekistan]] to the lowlands.<ref name="atkin">[[Muriel Atkin]]. ''Tajikistan'' in: Glenn E. Curtis (ed.): Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, Country Studies, [[Washington D.C.|Washington]]: 1997. pp. 197–290.</ref>

The results of this policy are to be seen in the ethnic composition of Salua oblast as well as in the fact that the Tajik population identifies themselves either as [[Gharmis]] (resettled from the mountains) or [[Kulobis]]. These groups never melted, and fought against each other during the [[Civil War in Tajikistan]]. Khatlon oblast suffered the heaviest damage in Tajikistan.

Since the conflicts leading to the civil war were never really resolved, tensions in the region still exist. The eastern part&nbsp;– [[Kulob]]&nbsp;– is home to the [[President of Tajikistan|president]] and his clan and has thus gained a lot of political influence. During Soviet times, the region cooperated with the then ruling elite from Leninabad, and was responsible for the militia, the army and the security forces. [[Kulob]] is regarded as a very conservative region. In the capital [[Bokhtar]] and parts of Kulob, the [[Islamic]] opposition has a lot of support among the [[Garmis]].<ref>Borjian, Habib, Kurgan Tepe, [http://www.iranica.com ''Encyclopaedia Iranica Online''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416193911/http://www.iranica.com/ |date=2019-04-16 }}</ref>

The Kulyab clan is based in Khatlon.<ref name=OVERVIEW>[http://ismaili.net/mirrors/112_tajik/tajkethn.html Ethnic groups at risk: The status of Tajiks] Heritage Society</ref> In February 1996 Colonel [[Mahmud Khudoiberdiyev]] launched a rebellion, insisting that three officials from the Kulyab clan resign before he ended the rebellion. The government complied. Additionally, [[Prime Minister of Tajikistan|Prime Minister]] [[Dzhamshed Karimov]] and Abudzhalil Khamidov, the Chairman of the Leninabad Oblast executive committee, resigned.<ref name=RESIG>[http://jamestown.org/print_friendly.php?volume_id=3&issue_id=125&article_id=1480 Tajikistan: Central Asian Powderkeg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181236/http://jamestown.org/print_friendly.php?volume_id=3&issue_id=125&article_id=1480 |date=2007-09-30 }} The Jamestown Foundation</ref>
