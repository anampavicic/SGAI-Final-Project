'''Muzaffargarh''' ({{langx|skr|{{unq|مظفر ڳڑھ}}}} and {{langx|ur|{{unq|مظفر گڑھ}}| |Fort of Muzaffar}}) is a city in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Located on the bank of the [[Chenab River]], it is the capital of the [[Muzaffargarh District|eponymous district]]. It is the 39th most populous city of Pakistan.

==History==

The Muzaffargarh region was an agricultural and forested area during the [[Indus Valley civilization]]. Then came the [[Vedic period]], which was characterized by the introduction of Indo-Aryan culture into the Punjab province. Over time, several other civilizations came to power in the ancient town and surrounding district: the Kambojas, the Daradas, the Kekayas, the Madras, the [[Pauravas]], the Yaudheyas, the [[Malavas]] and the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kurus]]. 

After the fall of the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]] in 331 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] marched into the present-day Punjab province with an army of 50,000 men. The Muzaffargarh region was, during different time periods, also ruled by the [[Maurya Empire]], the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], the [[Kushan Empire]], the [[Gupta Empire]], the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], the [[Kushano-Hephthalites]], and the [[Turk Shahi|Turk]] and [[Hindu Shahi]] kingdoms.

In 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]], and, in 1005, conquered the Shahis in [[Kabul]], which granted him power over the Punjab region. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later the [[Mughal Empire]] also ruled the region. The location of the present-day town became predominantly Muslim during this time because of the arrival of [[missionary]] [[Sufi]]s whose [[dargah]]s still persist in the area.

After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]] conquered the Muzaffargarh District. Later, in 1848, the [[British Raj]] assumed control of the area.

'''Foundation as a town'''

In 1794, the town of Muzaffargarh was founded by governor of [[Multan]], [[Nawab Muzaffar Khan]], who was also the Governor of [[Multan]] at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Cotton|first1=James Sutherland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHZDAAAAYAAJ&q=Muzaffargarh+founder&pg=PA77|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India ...|last2=Burn|first2=Sir Richard|last3=Meyer|first3=Sir William Stevenson|date=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref> The meaning of the word is "Fort of Muzaffar" because the "historic district" lies within the walls of a fort built by the governor.  In 1864, it became the capital of the Muzaffargarh District.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/weekly/herald/herald59.htm District Profile: Southern Punjab- Muzaffargarh]</ref>

The place was also referred to as Kala Pani (''Black Water''), as it is located between two rivers: the Indus and the [[Chenab River|Chenab]]. It was linked to the surrounding lands by bridges during the British era.

'''Independence 1947'''

During the independence movement of Pakistan, the Muslim population supported the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and the [[Pakistan Movement|Pakistani Movement]].  In 1947, after Pakistan gained independence, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in Muzaffargarh.
