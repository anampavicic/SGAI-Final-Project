'''Tamil Nadu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|æ|m|ᵻ|l|_|ˈ|n|ɑː|d|uː}}; {{IPA-ta|ˈtamiɻ ˈnaːɽɯ|lang|Tamil Nadu.ogg}}, {{small|abbr.}} '''TN''') is the southernmost [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[India]]. The [[List of states and union territories of India by area|tenth largest Indian state by area]] and the [[List of states and union territories of India by population|sixth largest by population]], Tamil Nadu is the home of the [[Tamil people]], who speak the [[Tamil language]]—the state's official language and one of the longest surviving [[Classical languages of India|classical languages]] of the world. The capital and largest city is [[Chennai]].

Located on the south-eastern coast of the [[Indian peninsula]], Tamil Nadu is straddled by the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Deccan Plateau]] in the west, the [[Eastern Ghats]] in the north, the [[Eastern Coastal Plains]] lining the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and the [[Palk Strait]] to the south-east, the [[Laccadive Sea]] at the southern [[Cape (geography)|cape]] of the peninsula, with the river [[Kaveri]] bisecting the state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Andhra Pradesh]], and encloses a part of the [[union territory]] of [[Puducherry (union territory)|Puducherry]]. It shares an international [[maritime border]] with the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]] of [[Sri Lanka]] at [[Pamban Island]].

[[Archaeological evidence]] points to Tamil Nadu being inhabited for more than 400 millennia, first by [[Archaic humans|hominids]] and then by modern [[human]]s. The state has more than 5,500 years of continuous cultural history. [[History of Tamil Nadu|Historically]], the [[Tamilakam]] region was inhabited by Tamil-speaking [[Dravidian people]], who were ruled by several regimes over centuries such as the [[Sangam era]] [[Three Crowned Kings|triumvirate]] of the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] and [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyas]], the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] (3rd–9th century CE), and the later [[Vijayanagara Empire]] (14th–17th century CE). [[Colonial India|European colonization]] began with establishing trade ports in the 17th century, with the [[British Raj|British controlling]] much of [[South India]] as the [[Madras Presidency]] for two centuries. After the [[India's Independence|Indian Independence]] in 1947, the region became the [[Madras State]] of the Republic of India and was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|1956]] into its current shape. The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil Country", in 1969. Hence, [[Tamil culture|culture]], [[Tamil cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|architecture]] have seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely.

As the most urbanised state of India, Tamil Nadu boasts an [[economy of Tamil Nadu|economy]] with gross state domestic product (GSDP) of {{INRConvert|23.65|t|lk=r}}, making it the [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP|second-largest]] economy amongst the 28 states of India. It has the country's [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP per capita|9th-highest GSDP per capita]] of {{INRConvert|275583|lk=r}} and ranks [[List of Indian states and territories by Human Development Index|11th]] in [[human development index]]. Tamil Nadu is also one of the most industrialised states, with the [[manufacturing sector]] accounting for nearly one-third of the state's GDP. With its diverse culture and architecture, long coastline, forests and mountains, Tamil Nadu is home to a number of ancient relics, historic buildings, religious sites, [[beaches]], [[hill stations]], [[forts]], [[waterfalls]] and four [[World Heritage Site]]s. The state's [[Tourism in Tamil Nadu|tourism industry]] is the largest among the Indian states. The state has three [[biosphere reserves]], [[mangrove]] forests, five [[National Parks]], 18 [[wildlife sanctuaries]] and 17 [[bird sanctuaries]]. The [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film industry]], nicknamed as Kollywood, plays an influential role in the state's popular culture.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from [[Tamil language]] with ''nadu'' meaning "land" and Tamil Nadu meaning "the land of Tamils". The [[Tamil language#Etymology|origin]] and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it.<ref name="Zvelebil">{{cite book|first=Kamil V.|last=Zvelebil|year=1973|title=The smile of Murugan: on Tamil literature of South India|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-3-447-01582-0|pages=11–12}}</ref> In the ancient [[Sangam literature]], [[Tamilakam]] refers to the area of present-day Tamil Nadu, [[Kerala]] and parts of [[Karnataka]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]].
