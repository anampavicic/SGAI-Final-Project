'''Salé''' ({{langx|ar|سلا|salā}}, {{IPA|ar|salaː|}}){{Efn|The city's name is sometimes transliterated as '''Salli''', '''Sallee''', or '''Sala'''.}} is a city in northwestern [[Morocco]], on the right bank of the [[Bou Regreg]] river, opposite the national capital [[Rabat]], for which it serves as a [[commuter town]]. Along with some smaller nearby towns, Rabat and Salé form together a single [[metropolitan area]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cybriwsky |first=Roman Adrian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kzEEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA253 |title=Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-61069-248-9 |pages=253 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Abu-Lughod |first=Janet L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKP_AwAAQBAJ&dq=sala+morocco+rabat+metropolitan+area&pg=PA6 |title=Rabat: Urban Apartheid in Morocco |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4008-5303-8 |pages=6 |language=en}}</ref>

Founded in the 11th century, it later became a haven for pirates in the 17th century as an [[Republic of Salé|independent republic]] before being incorporated into [[Alawi dynasty|Alawi]] Morocco. It recorded a population of 890,403 in the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name="citydefn">{{cite web |url=http://rgph2014.hcp.ma/file/165548/ |title=Note de présentation des premiers résultats du Recensement Général de la Population et de l'Habitat 2014 |language=fr |publisher=[[Haut Commissariat au Plan|High Commission for Planning]] |page=8 |date=20 March 2015 |access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref> The city still preserves its historic [[Medina quarter|medina]] (old town), with many major monuments dating from the [[Marinid Sultanate|Marinid]] period (13th–15th centuries).

The Arab historians [[al-Bakri]] and [[Ibn Hawqal]] mention the existence of a town along the Bou Regreg at an early era, but they may have been referring to Chellah (former Sala Colonia) rather than the present town of Salé.<ref name=":2" /> The town of Salé proper was probably founded in the 11th century by families from [[al-Andalus]] (present-day Spain), most importantly the Banu 'Ashara.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Mouline |first=Saïd |title=The City in the Islamic World |publisher=Brill |year=2008 |isbn=9789004171688 |volume=1 |pages=643–662 |chapter=Rabat.

The Banu 'Ashara reportedly hosted [[Ibn Tumart]], the founder of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] movement, in their palace in 1121, while he was on his way to [[Marrakesh]].<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":3" /> They resisted the Almohad invasion under Ibn Tumart's successor, [[Abd al-Mu'min|'Abd al-Mu'min]] ({{Reign|1130|1163}}). As a result, the latter destroyed the city walls, eliminated the Banu 'Ashara and seized their palace.<ref name=":2" /> When Abd al-Mu'min summoned the rulers of al-Andalus to pledge allegiance to him in 1151, he received them in this palace.<ref name=":3" />

Later in the 12th century, when the Almohad caliph [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] ({{Reign|1184|1199}}) founded Ribat al-Fath (present-day [[Rabat]]) across the river, Salé seems to have remained important and was used as a residence by the Almohad caliphs, who also made various improvements to the city.<ref name=":2">{{Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|volume=8|pages=898–899|first=Halima|last=Ferhat|article=Salā}}</ref> The current [[Great Mosque of Salé]] was built on the order of Yaqub al-Mansur in 1196, over the site of city's former main mosque whose roof had collapsed.<ref name="Abu-Lughod2014">{{cite book |author=Janet L.

During the Marinid period, the city's fortifications continued to be upgraded and a new protected harbour was built. The harbour, located on the south side of the city, was linked to the river by two channels, with Bab el-Mrisa and another monumental gate serving as [[Watergate (architecture)|water gates]] through which boats passed.<ref name=":12" /> The Marinids added new religious and charitable constructions, including the [[Madrasa of Abu al-Hasan]], the [[Zawiya al-Nussak]], and a [[maristan]] (hospital for the [[mentally ill]]).<ref name=":12" />

In the 14th century, Ibn 'Ashir (d. 1362 or 1363), a [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic from al-Andalus, moved to Salé and attracted other Sufis to him, including [[Ibn Abbad al-Rundi]].<ref>{{Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|volume=3|pages=719–720|first=A.|last=Faure|article=Ibn ʿĀs̲h̲ir}}</ref> Ibn Ashir later became the patron saint of the city<ref name=":2" /> and his mausoleum dominates the large seaside cemetery of the medina.<ref name=":12" />

European powers took action to try to eliminate the threat from the Barbary Coast. On 20 July 1629, the city of Salé was bombarded by French Admiral [[Isaac de Razilly]] with a fleet composed of the ships ''Licorne'', ''Saint-Louis'', ''Griffon'', ''Catherine'', ''Hambourg'', ''Sainte-Anne'', ''Saint-Jean''; his forces destroyed three corsair ships.<ref>Coindreau 2006. p. 192</ref><ref>Jamieson 2013, p. 109</ref>

===20th century===
{{Unsourced section|date=September 2023}}
During the decades preceding the independence of Morocco, Salé was the stronghold of some "national movement" activists. The reading of the "Latif" (a politically charged prayer to God, read in mosques in loud unison) was launched in Salé and became popular in some cities of Morocco.

A petition against the so-called "[[Berber Dahir]]" (a decree that allowed some Berber-speaking areas of Morocco to continue using Berber Law, as opposed to Sharia Law) was given to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Sultan Mohamed V]] and the Resident General of France. The petition and the "Latif" prayer led to the withdrawal and adjustment of the so-called "Berber Decree" of May 1930. The activists who opposed the "Berber Decree" apparently feared that the explicit recognition of the Berber Customary Law (a very secular-minded Berber tradition) would threaten the position of Islam and its Sharia law system. Others believed that opposing the French-engineered "Berber Decree" was a means to turn the table against the French occupation of Morocco.

The widespread storm that was created by the "Berber Dahir" controversy created a somewhat popular Moroccan nationalist elite based in Salé and [[Fes|Fez]]; it had strong anti-Berber, anti-West, anti-secular, and pro  Arab-Islamic inclinations. This period helped develop the political awareness and activism that would lead fourteen years later to the signing of the [[Manifest of Independence of Morocco]] on 11 January 1944 by many "Slawi" activists and leaders. Salé has been deemed to have been the stronghold of the Moroccan left for many decades, where many leaders have resided.

Salé, like many other Moroccan cities, had its own [[mellah]], where the Jewish community resided. Raphael Encaoua, a famous rabbi born in Salé is buried in the Jewish cemetery nearby.<ref>{{cite web |title=Salé |url=https://moroccanjews.org/home/sites-of-jewish-interest/coastal-cities-and-towns/sale-2/ |website=Visiting Jewish Morocco |access-date=18 June 2024}}</ref>

==Climate==

Salé has a [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') with warm to hot dry summers and mild damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Salé has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach Sub {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about {{convert|7|to|8|C}}. The winter highs typically reach only {{convert|17.2|°C|1|abbr=on}} in December–February. Summer daytime highs usually hover around {{convert|25|°C|1|abbr=on}}, but may occasionally exceed {{convert|30|°C|1|abbr=on}}, especially during heat waves. Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between {{convert|11|°C|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19|°C|1|abbr=on}} and rarely exceeding {{convert|20|°C|1|abbr=on}}. Rabat belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 560&nbsp;mm.

Salé's climate resembles that of the southwest coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the coast of [[Southern California]].

== Landmarks ==
The historic old city ([[Medina quarter|medina]]) of Salé occupies a large area near the mouth of the Bou Regreg river. It is enclosed by defensive walls pierced with several entrances, the most notable of which is [[Bab el-Mrissa|Bab el-Mrisa]] ('Gate of the Little Port'), a monumental gate on the southeast side of the city, dating to the 1270s.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":123">{{Cite book |last=Parker |first=Richard |url=https://archive.org/details/practicalguideto0000rich_l1s6 |title=A practical guide to Islamic Monuments in Morocco |publisher=The Baraka Press |year=1981 |isbn= |location=Charlottesville, VA |pages=93–101 |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Marinid Madrasa of Salé (87761966).jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Madrasa of Abu al-Hasan]], a 14th-century [[madrasa]] located next to the Great Mosque]]
The religious center of the city is the [[Great Mosque of Salé|Great Mosque]], located in the western half of the medina. Next to the mosque is the [[Madrasa of Abu al-Hasan]], a [[madrasa]] building dating to 1342,<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":123" /> which is one of the architectural highlights of the city.<ref name="Abu-Lughod20142">{{cite book |author=Janet L.

The mausoleum complex of Sidi Abdallah ibn Hassun, one of the two patron saints of the city, is located just west of the mosque. The other patron saint of the city, Ibn Athir, is buried in a prominent mausoleum further west, near the shore.<ref name=":123" />

One of the other historic landmarks of the city is the [[Funduq Askour]], the former [[maristan]] (hospital).<ref name=":12" /> It was originally built by the Marinid sultan [[Abu Inan Faris|Abu Inan]] towards 1350. All that remains of the original building today is a highly-decorated entrance portal.<ref name=":123" />

A short distance east of the city walls is the [[Zawiya al-Nussak]], originally built in 1356 by Abu Inan, most likely as a lodge for [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=":022">{{Cite book |last=Marçais |first=Georges |title=L'architecture musulmane d'Occident |publisher=Arts et métiers graphiques |year=1954 |location=Paris |pages=284}}</ref> By the 20th century it had fallen into ruin but it has recently been restored.

Another landmark outside the city walls is the 14th-century aqueduct built by the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan to improve the city's water supply. A preserved section roughly {{Convert|2.5|km|mi}} long can be found to the north of the medina, at one point straddling the modern road that leads north to Kenitra.<ref name=":123" />

=== Transport ===

==== Air ====
[[File:Rabat-Salé airport.jpg|thumb|[[Rabat-Salé Airport]]]]
Salé's main airport is [[Rabat–Salé Airport]], which is located in Salé but also serves [[Rabat]], the capital city of [[Morocco]].

==== Trains ====
Salé is served by two principal railway stations run by the national rail service, the [[ONCF]]. These stations are [[Salé-Tabriquet Railway Station|Salé-Tabriquet]] and [[Salé-City railway station|Salé-Ville]].

Salé-Ville is the main inter-city station, from which trains run south to [[Rabat]], [[Casablanca]], [[Marrakech]] and [[El Jadida]], north to [[Tanger]], or east to [[Meknes]], [[Fes]], Taza and [[Oujda]].

==== Tram ====
[[File:Tramway de Salé.jpg|thumb|[[Rabat-Salé tramway]]]]
The [[Rabat–Salé tramway]] was the first tramway network in Morocco and it connects Salé with Rabat across the river. It was opened on 11 May 2011 after a construction cost of 3.6 billion [[Moroccan dirham|MAD]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=L'Opinion |title=Tramway / Rabat-Salé : 7,8 MDH pour la 3ème phase de développement |url=https://www.lopinion.ma/Tramway-Rabat-Sale-78-MDH-pour-la-3eme-phase-de-developpement_a29624.html |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=L'Opinion Maroc |language=fr}}</ref> The network was constructed by [[Alstom Citadis]] and is operated by [[Transdev]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Morocco: Inauguration of tramway line between Rabat and Salé |url=https://www.icafrica.org/en/news-events/infrastructure-news/article/morocco-inauguration-of-tramway-line-between-rabat-and-sale-1965/ |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=ICA |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Qui sommes-nous ? |url=https://www.tram-way.ma/fr/qui-sommes-nous/ |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=Tramway Rabat Salé |language=fr-FR}}</ref> As of February 2022, the network had two lines with a total length of {{convert|26.9|km|0|abbr=in}} and 43 stations.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=MISE EN SERVICE COMMERCIALE DE L'EXTENSION DE LA LIGNE 2 DU RESEAU DU TRAMWAY DE RABAT SALE LE MERCREDI 16 FERVIER 2022 |url=https://www.tram-way.ma/fr/mise-en-service-commerciale-de-lextension-de-la-ligne-2-du-reseau-du-tramway-de-rabat-sale-le-mercredi-16-fervier-2022/ |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=Tramway Rabat Salé |language=fr-FR}}</ref>  In 2023, an extension of the network was being planned and is due to be completed by 2028.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=El Masaiti |first=Amira |date=2023-07-20 |title=Rabat Tramway network extends in the directions of Temara and Sale |url=https://en.hespress.com/67795-rabat-tramway-network-extends-for-kilometers-in-the-directions-of-temara-and-sale.html |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=HESPRESS English - Morocco News |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Water ===
[[Water supply]] and [[wastewater]] collection in Salé was {{when|date=June 2014}} irregular, with poorer and illegal housing units suffering the highest costs and most acute scarcities.<ref name="Benoit">Guillaume Benoit and Aline Comeau, ''A Sustainable Future for the Mediterranean'' (2005) 640 pages</ref> Much of the city used to rely upon communal [[standpipe (street)|standpipes]], which were often shut down, depriving some neighbourhoods of safe [[drinking water]]<ref name="Benoit" /> for indefinite periods of time. Nevertheless, Salé fared better than inland Moroccan locations, where [[water scarcity]] was even more acute.<ref name="Benoit" /> Improvements from the government, local businesses and the water distribution companies of ''Régie de distribution d'Eau & d'Électricité de Rabat-Salé'' (REDAL) {{As of|2010|lc=y}} have meant that this situation has improved drastically.<ref name="Palmer2010">{{cite book|author=Richard N.

==In popular culture==
{{Unsourced section|date=September 2023}}

The film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' was partially filmed in Salé, in particular the wide angle aerial shots with helicopters flying down the coastline.

The character [[Robinson Crusoe]], in the early part of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel by the same name, spends time in captivity of the local pirates, the [[Salé Rovers]], and at last sails off to liberty from the mouth of the Salé river - an adventure less well remembered than the protagonist's later sojourn on the [[desert island]].
