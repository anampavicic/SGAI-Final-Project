===Kingdom of Luzon===

[[Manila]], to the extent that it has this placename, was likely founded in the Middle Ages, or between 400 and 1500s, due to the Sanskrit origin of the component "nila" in its name which refers to "indigo", and the prevalence of the placename during the rule of Raja Matanda, the old King of Luzon, who was born in the early 1500s. The earliest evidence of Hinduism and Sanskrit influence in maritime Southeast Asia is in Sanskrit inscriptions from the late 300s in eastern Kalimantan (or Borneo). This analysis of the placename is supported by many other nearby placenames in the Tagalog region with the prefix "may-". As for Luzon, what is now considered Luzon island, or at least its southern portion, was called "Luzon the greater", while what is now considered Mindoro island was called "Luzon the lesser".

[[Manila]] has historically been a [[global city]] due to its role for international trade. By the 15th and 16th centuries, Manila was a walled and fortified city and was the capital of the Kingdom of Luzon. Its institution, government, and economy were associated with the Tagalogs and the Kapampangans, and the Malay language was extensively used for foreign affairs as customary in much of Southeast Asia at the time. It was also well known by other Southeast Asian kingdoms such as Cebu, Brunei, Melaka, other Malay kingdoms, and Ternate, and may be known in East Asia as far as China and Japan.

In the current territory of Metropolitan Manila, there were several lordships that were either sovereign or tributary such as [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]] (''Tundók''), [[Malate, Manila |Malate]] (''Maalát''), [[Navotas]] (''Nabútas''), [[Malabon|Tambobong]] (''Tambúbong''), [[Taguig]] (''Tagiig''), [[Parañaque]] (''Palanyág''), [[Cainta (historical polity)|Cainta]] (''Kay Intâ''), and Pateros.

Shortly after Raja Matanda's birth, sometime around the early 1500s while he was ''raja muda'' or heir apparent, his father, the King of Luzon, died, leaving his mother as Queen Regent of Luzon. By 1511, Luzonians had been carrying out large-scale trade at least within maritime Southeast Asia with some Luzonians being hired as officials in Melaka and some Luzonian merchants gaining royal favors in Brunei. It was in Melaka that Luzonians met the Portuguese before the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in 1511. In 1521, Raja Matanda, then still a young man, was known in maritime Southeast Asia as the son of the King of Luzon. He married a princess of Brunei and served as an admiral for his grandfather, the Sultan of Brunei, in an attack near Java in exchange for soldiers and a fleet of ships. On the way home, he met and had an encounter with a Castilian fleet.

Some Luzonians in the 1500s had also been taking part in mercenary work in other kingdoms. The Luzonians' commercial influence also reached as far as Butuan. By the 1570s, the ruling class of Manila together with the international Luzonian merchants were Muslim and Islam was spreading through the freemen and the slaves.

On May 24, 1570, the battle of Manila was fought between the Kingdom of Luzon, under the command of the heir apparent Prince Sulayman, and the Kingdom of the Spains and the Indies, under the command of field marshal Martin de Goiti who was aided by some foreign forces. This resulted in the arson and destruction of Manila.

===Spanish rule===

After destroying Manila, the Spanish set up a settlement to secure territory on the same site on the Luzon island for the Spanish ruler. Initially enclosed in wood, much later in stone, a new walled city of Manila became the capital of the Spanish East Indies. After setting up a settlement and consolidating some territorial holdings outwards, the Spanish instituted a province known as [[Manila (province)|Manila]].

Later on, the [[Manila galleon]] continually sailed the Pacific from end-to-end, bringing to [[Mexico]] Asian merchandise and cultural exchange.

===First Philippine Republic===

In the First Philippine Republic, the province included the walled city of Manila and 23 other municipalities. [[Marikina|Mariquina]] also served as the provincial capital from 1898 to 1899. However, despite almost the entirety of the territory being occupied by Philippine forces, the walled city of Manila was occupied by Spanish forces.

In 1939, during the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]], President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] established [[Quezon City]] with the objective of replacing [[Manila]] as the capital city of the Philippines. A design for Quezon City was completed. The establishment of Quezon City meant the abandonment of Burnham's design for Manila, with funds being diverted for the establishment of the new capital

Quezon]] created the [[City of Greater Manila]] as an emergency measure, merging the cities of Manila and Quezon City, along with the municipalities of [[Caloocan]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Parañaque]], [[Pasay]], and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]].<ref name="eo400">{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=400, s. 1942|title=Creating the City of Greater Manila|date=January 1, 1942|accessdate=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1942/01/01/executive-order-no-400-s-1942/|archive-date=July 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220701173652/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1942/01/01/executive-order-no-400-s-1942/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Jorge B.

This was to ensure that Vargas, who was Quezon's principal lieutenant for administrative matters, would have a position of authority recognized under international military law. The City of Greater Manila served as a model for the present-day Metro Manila and the administrative functions of the Governor of Metro Manila that was established during the Marcos administration. 

After World War II, in 1945, President [[Sergio Osmeña]] signed Executive Order No. 58, which dissolved the city of Greater Manila instituted by former President Quezon.<ref name="eo58">{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=58, s. 1945|title=Reducing the Territory of the City of Greater Manila|date=July 25, 1945|accessdate=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/|archive-date=March 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308195829/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Third Philippine Republic===
====Creation of the National Capital Region====
[[World War II]] resulted in the loss of more than 100,000 lives in the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|battle of Manila]] in 1945. Most of the developments in Burnham's design were also destroyed. Later on, Quezon City was eventually declared as the [[national capital]] in 1948 and later expanded to the areas formerly under the jurisdiction of Caloocan, Marikina, and [[San Mateo, Rizal]]. 

====Reinstitution as Metropolitan Manila under martial law====
On November 7, 1975, Metro Manila was formally established through Presidential Decree No. 824. The Metropolitan Manila Commission was also created to manage the region.<ref name="PD824" /> On June 2, 1978, through Presidential Decree No. 1396, the metropolitan area was declared the National Capital Region of the Philippines.<ref name="PD1396">{{cite PH act|url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/26/16961|title=Creating the Department of Human Settlements and the Human Settlements Development Corporation, Appropriating Funds Therefor, and Accordingly Amending Certain Presidential Decrees|chamber=PD|number=1396|date=1978-06-02|publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court E-Library]]|accessdate=2023-07-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20230710122046/https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/26/16961|archivedate=2023-07-10|url-status=live}}</ref> When Metro Manila was established, there were four cities, [[Manila]], [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan]], [[Pasay]] and the thirteen municipalities of [[Las Piñas]], [[Makati]], [[Malabon]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Marikina]], [[Muntinlupa]], [[Navotas]], [[Parañaque]], [[Pasig]], [[Pateros]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Taguig]], and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]]. At present, all but one of these municipalities have become independent chartered cities; only Pateros still remains as a [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]].

President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] appointed his wife, [[First Spouse of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]], as the first [[governor of Metro Manila]]. She launched the [[City of Man]] campaign. The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex]], Metropolitan [[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas|Folk Arts Theater]], [[Philippine International Convention Center]], [[Coconut Palace]] and healthcare facilities such as the [[Lung Center of the Philippines]], [[Philippine Heart Center]], and the [[National Kidney and Transplant Institute|Kidney Center of the Philippines]] are all constructed precisely for this purpose. 

The capital of the Philippines was re-designated to [[Manila]] in 1976 through Presidential Decree No. 940. The decree states that Manila has always been, to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world, the premier city of the Philippines, being the center of trade, commerce, education, and culture. While the then-newly formed region was designated as the [[seat of government]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=PD|number=940|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno940.html#.UXU0i8qwV7k|title=Establishing Manila as the Capital of the Philippines and as the Permanent Seat of the National Government |date=June 24, 1976|publisher=Chan C.

===Fourth Philippine Republic===

President Marcos was overthrown in a [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] revolution along [[EDSA]], which lasted four days in late February 1986.

===Fifth Philippine Republic===
In 1986, President [[Corazon Aquino]] laid down the Executive Order No. 392, reorganizing and changing the structure of the Metropolitan Manila Commission and renamed it to the Metropolitan Manila Authority. [[Mayors of Metro Manila|Mayors]] in the metropolis chose from among themselves the chair of the agency. Later on, it was again reorganized in 1995 through Republic Act No. 7924, creating the present-day [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]]. The chairperson of the agency would be appointed by the President and should not have a concurrent elected position such as mayor. Elfren Cruz was the last to serve as the Officer-In-Charge governor of Metro Manila.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Was Marcos right?

==Geography==
{{See also|Geography of Manila|Land reclamation in Metro Manila}}

[[File:Metro Manila Elevation Map.png|thumb|150px|Metropolitan Manila, or the National Capital Region, is divided morphologically into three major parts. These are the: Central Plateau, Coastal Lowland, and Marikina Valley]]
[[File:Pasig-marikina_river_drainagebasin.png|thumb|150px|Drainage map of the [[Pasig River|Pasig]]-[[Marikina River]] system]]

Metro Manila is located in the southwestern portion of [[Luzon]]. The region lies along the flat [[Alluvium|alluvial]] lands extending from the mouth of the [[Pasig River]] in the west to the higher rugged lands of Marikina Valley in the east. The region is geographically divided into 4 zones: the Coastal Margin, Guadalupe Plateau, Marikina Valley, and the Laguna Lowlands.

The Coastal Margin or Lowland is a flat and low plain that faces [[Manila Bay]]. Located here is [[Manila]], [[Navotas]], parts of [[Malabon]], and the western part and reclaimed areas of [[Pasay]] and [[Parañaque]], where the ground elevation ranges from zero meters on Manila Bay to {{convert|5|m|sp=us|spell=in}} at the west side of the cities of [[Mandaluyong]] and [[Makati]]. The Coastal Lowland possesses resources for offshore fisheries and fishpond development, and various [[land reclamation|reclamation projects]] in the area are meant for mixed-use urban development.

The Central or Guadalupe Plateau is the most adaptable to urban development activities not only because of its solid geographical foundations but also because of its existing infrastructure links with the rest of Luzon. It is mainly residential and includes the densely populated areas of Metro Manila such [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Makati]] and [[Quezon City]], as well as most parts of [[Caloocan]] and [[Mandaluyong]]. The ground elevation ranges from {{convert|20|to|40|m|sp=us}} and gradually becomes lower towards its western side, while ground elevation ranges from {{convert|70|to|100|m|sp=us}} towards the northwestern side of the plateau. The area becomes narrower along the [[Pasig River]].

The Marikina Valley is a [[floodplain]] along the [[Marikina River]] and a delta along [[Laguna de Bay]]. Its elevation ranges from {{convert|2|m|sp=us|spell=in}} on the Laguna de Bay side to {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} on its north side towards Montalban. It is surrounded by the Central Plateau and mountains of Rizal. It has fertile land suitable for crop cultivation while the [[Marikina River]] provides water for industrial uses and discharge.

The Laguna Lowlands is not only suitable for [[agriculture]] and [[aquaculture]] but also for industrial activity.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 2010 |title=Metro Manila and Its 200KM Radius Sphere |url=https://openjicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12001491_02.pdf |access-date=November 13, 2020 |publisher=Japan International Cooperation Agency |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114110845/https://openjicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12001491_02.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Natural hazards===
[[File:ManggahanFloodwayOndoy.jpg|thumb|Flooding brought by [[Typhoon Ketsana]] (Tropical Storm Ondoy) in 2009 caused 484 deaths in Metro Manila alone.]]

Metro Manila is exposed to multiple natural hazards such as [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, and [[typhoon]]s. It is surrounded by active [[Fault (geology)|faults]] including the [[Marikina Valley Fault System]]. Other distant faults such as the [[Philippine Fault System|Philippine Faults]], Lubang Faults, [[Manila Trench]] and Casiguran Faults, are a threat as well.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lila Ramos Shahani |date=May 11, 2015 |title=Living on a Fault Line: Manila in a 7.2 Earthquake |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2015/05/11/1453392/living-fault-line-manila-7.2-earthquake |url-status=dead |access-date=May 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518090248/http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2015/05/11/1453392/living-fault-line-manila-7.2-earthquake |archive-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> Flooding is recurrent every year especially in low-lying areas of [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]], [[Malabon]], [[Caloocan]], [[Navotas]], [[Manila]], [[Pasay]], [[Parañaque]], and [[Las Piñas]], where flood are generally linked with the [[tide|tidal movements]] in [[Manila Bay]]. Meanwhile, [[Marikina]], [[Pasig]], [[Taguig]], and [[Pateros]] are areas inland that are also prone to flooding. These areas are located along the Marikina Valley where there is poor soil drainage and a shallow [[water table]] due to being in proximity to Laguna Bay's shores. Flood risks are generally lower in cities along the Guadalupe Plateau, including [[Quezon City]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]] and [[Muntinlupa]], where volcanic rocks rise up to {{convert|40|to|70|m|sp=us}} above sea level.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pornasdoro |first1=Karlo |last2=Silva |first2=Liz |last3=Munárriz |first3=Maria Lourdes |last4=Estepa |first4=Beau |last5=Capaque |first5=Curtis |title=Flood Risk of Metro Manila Barangays: A GIS Based Risk Assessment Using Multi-Criteria Techniques |url=https://conference.surp.upd.edu.ph/downloads/JURP1/JURP_04_PORNASDORO_arial_lines_05a.pdf |journal=Journal in Urban and Regional Planning |volume=1 |issue=2014 |pages=51–72 |access-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-date=January 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107124213/https://conference.surp.upd.edu.ph/downloads/JURP1/JURP_04_PORNASDORO_arial_lines_05a.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Around five to seven typhoons hit Manila yearly.

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], there are two climates in Metro Manila. Most of the region has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] (Köppen climate classification Aw) while the northeastern part of the region that lies on the foothills of [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] has a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the [[equator]] means that temperatures are hot year-round, rarely going below 15&nbsp;°C or above 39&nbsp;°C. Temperature extremes have ranged from 14.4&nbsp;°C on January 11, 1914,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Temperatures drop further in Baguio, MM |work=[[Philippine Star]] |url=http://www.philstar.com:8080/nation/2014/01/01/1273885/temperatures-drop-further-baguio-mm |url-status=dead |access-date=October 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025102904/http://www.philstar.com:8080/nation/2014/01/01/1273885/temperatures-drop-further-baguio-mm |archive-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref> to 38.8&nbsp;°C on April 27, 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Philippines endure extreme heat until mid May |url=https://qa.philstar.com/headlines/2024/04/28/2351079/philippines-endure-extreme-heat-until-mid-may |access-date=April 28, 2024 |publisher=[[Philstar.com]]}}</ref>

Humidity levels are usually very high all year round. Manila has a distinct [[dry season]] from December through April, and a relatively lengthy [[wet season]] that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures. In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods. [[Typhoon]]s usually occur from June to September.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manila |url=http://jeepneyguide.com/manila/travel-guide |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822140435/http://jeepneyguide.com/manila/travel-guide |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |access-date=March 4, 2014 |publisher=Jeepneyguide}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2019}}

The framework of government and governance in Metro Manila is based on [[Philippine legal codes|Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the "Local Government Code of 1991"]]. This law outlines the powers and responsibilities of all local government units (LGUS) in the Philippines and thus forms the basis of inter-local governmental relations among the area's constituent local governments. The local government code grants these units significant political and administrative autonomy in accordance with the principles of decentralization and devolution of power. This situation presents a challenge to the coordination of policy and service delivery across the multiple autonomous local government units and is thus the underlying dilemma of metropolitan governance in Metro Manila.

The [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA) is the agency responsible for the delivery of public services in Metro Manila. Its services are limited to traffic management and garbage collection. Previously Metro Manila was governed by a regional government authority, the Metro Manila Commission and was [[Governor of Metro Manila|led by a governor]].

A bill was introduced in 2014 proposing the creation of a new governing body in Metro Manila to be known as the Metropolitan Manila Regional Administration (MMRA). Unlike the MMDA which is limited to being an administrative coordinating body, the proposed MMRA will have police and other typical municipal powers and is more akin to the [[Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bill creating new Metro Manila body backed |work=[[Philippine Star]] |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/09/25/1372873/bill-creating-new-metro-manila-body-backed |url-status=live |access-date=September 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006073115/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/09/25/1372873/bill-creating-new-metro-manila-body-backed |archive-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=DOJ backs creation of Metropolitan Manila Regional Administration |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer|Inquirer.net]] |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/640403/doj-backs-creation-of-metropolitan-manila-regional-administration |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125119/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/640403/doj-backs-creation-of-metropolitan-manila-regional-administration |archive-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref>

Metro Manila, the National Capital Region, is the seat of the national government. All the main offices of the [[executive departments of the Philippines|executive departments of the country]] are in Metro Manila. The [[Department of Agrarian Reform]], [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]], [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]], National Housing Authority and [[Philippine Coconut Authority]] has their main offices based around [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in [[Quezon City]].

[[Manila]], the capital city of the country, is the home to [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañan Palace]], the official residence and office of the [[President of the Philippines]]. The city is also the home to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. Other key national institutions based in Manila are the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], and the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Departments]] of [[Department of Budget and Management|Budget and Management]], [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Finance]], [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Health]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]], [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]] and [[Department of Public Works and Highways|Public Works and Highways]]. Meanwhile, the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] is based in [[Taguig]] while the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] has its headquarters in [[Makati]]. Important economic and financial institutions headquartered in the region are the [[Asian Development Bank]], [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], [[Development Bank of the Philippines]], [[Land Bank of the Philippines]] and the [[National Economic and Development Authority]].

The main office of the [[Government Service Insurance System]] in [[Pasay]] serves as home to the [[Senate of the Philippines]]. Meanwhile, the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] is based in the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], [[Quezon City]] along with the [[Sandiganbayan]]. The [[Coconut Palace]] once served as the official office and residence of the [[Vice President of the Philippines]] in 2010–2016 and then the [[Quezon City Reception House]] for 2016-2022.

===Administrative divisions===
The political and administrative boundaries of the National Capital Region has not changed since its formation in 1975 as a public corporation under Presidential Decree No. 824. They are composed of sixteen [[Cities in the Philippines#Independent cities|independent cities]], classified as ''highly urbanized cities'', and one independent municipality: [[Pateros]].

During the American occupation, housing policies in Manila dealt the problem of sanitation and concentration of settlers around business areas. Among those implemented were business codes and sanitation laws in slum areas in the 1930s. During this period and until the 1950s, new communities were opened for relocation. Among these were Projects 1–8 in [[Quezon City]] and the Vitas tenement houses in Tondo. The government implemented the Public Housing Policy in 1947 that established the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). A few years later, it put up the Slum Clearance Committee which, with the help of the PHHC, relocated thousands of families from Tondo and Quezon City to Sapang Palay in [[San Jose del Monte, Bulacan]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hetOAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA36 |title=Report |publisher=Office of Economic Coordination |year=1963 |location=Philippines |pages=36 |language=en}}</ref>

During the time of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]] supported the programs for the "development of relocation" and "on-site development." [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]] and [[Dasmariñas]] in [[Cavite]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] opened as relocation sites. Along with the establishment of the [[National Housing Authority (Philippines)]], Presidential Decree 772 made squatting a crime, making the Philippines one of only two countries (the other is [[South Africa]]) where squatting is a crime. The government formulated the National Shelter Program which became the over-all framework for dealing with housing needs of all income classes.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

[[Imelda Marcos]] held both the position as Governor of Metro Manila and as Minister of Human Settlements and Ecology (MHSE) until the downfall of the dictatorship in 1986. The MHSE, through loans from the World Bank, initiated the Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sites and Services (BLISS) housing projects not only in Metro Manila but also in other provinces.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 9, 1979 |title=Executive Order No. 517, s. 1979 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1979/01/09/executive-order-no-517-s-1979/ |access-date=July 21, 2021 |website=www.officialgazette.gov.ph |archive-date=July 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210721095352/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1979/01/09/executive-order-no-517-s-1979/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |date=November 28, 1983 |title=Proclamation No. 2321, s. 1983 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1983/11/28/proclamation-no-2321-s-1983/ |access-date=July 21, 2021 |website=www.officialgazette.gov.ph |archive-date=July 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210721095353/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1983/11/28/proclamation-no-2321-s-1983/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

From 1960 to 1992, the government transferred some 328,000 families to resettlement sites {{convert|25|to|40|km|abbr=on}} from Metro Manila. According to the Asian Coalition on Housing Rights, during President Corazon C. Aquino's time, the government would bring some 100,000 persons to relocation sites yearly. During the said period, Sapang Palay and Carmona had a 60% abandonment rate. Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7279 or the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA) in 1992. The law gave a new name for the [[Squatting|squatters]]: informal settlers.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=7279|title=An Act to provide for a comprehensive and continuing urban development and housing program, establish the mechanism for its implementation, and for other purposes|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1992/03/24/republic-act-no-7279/|date=March 24, 1992|accessdate=May 26, 2023|archive-date=November 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109053552/http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1992/03/24/republic-act-no-7279/|url-status=live}}</ref> Essentially, UDHA gives protection for big private ownership of land in the urban areas, ensuring that these are protected from illegal occupants. The law also widened the scope of private sector participation in the National Shelter Program (NSP).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In the middle of the presidency of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], infrastructure projects of the government led to the demolition of hundreds of thousands of families (from along railways, [[Circumferential Road 4|C-4 Road]], [[Circumferential Road 5|C-5 Road]], and from [[Fort Bonifacio]]). During the same period, new relocation sites in Bulacan, Valenzuela and Caloocan opened.

Historically, the main business district of the metropolis was [[Binondo]], where commercial trading flourished since the 15th century. By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from Binondo to [[Makati]]. It transformed Makati into one of the leading financial centers in [[Asia]]. Still, Binondo remained as a cultural and financial center because of the vast Chinese population residing and doing business in the area.

The minimum wage of Metro Manila is at {{Philippine peso|645.00}} ([[United States dollars|$]]{{To USD|645.00|round=2|Philippines}}) per-day for non-agricultural workers and at {{Philippine peso|608.00}} (${{To USD|608.00|round=2|Philippines}}) per-day for those working in the agricultural sector,<ref>{{Cite news |date=July 1, 2024|first=Zen|last=Hernandez|title=NCR workers to get P35 daily minimum wage hike|work=[[ABS-CBN News]]|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/2024/7/1/ncr-workers-to-get-p35-daily-minimum-wage-hike-1446|accessdate=August 23, 2024}}</ref> the highest minimum wage among all the [[Regions of the Philippines|17 regions]] of the country.<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 19, 2015 |title=Good news but… Metro Manila minimum pay up by P15 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer|INQUIRER.net]] |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/679890/good-news-but-metro-manila-minimum-pay-up-by-p15 |url-status=live |access-date=March 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319190040/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/679890/good-news-but-metro-manila-minimum-pay-up-by-p15 |archive-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref> However, an increase of ₱25 was made and implemented in November 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |title=P25 wage hike takes effect on November 22, 2018 |url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2018/11/13/1868052/p25-wage-hike-takes-effect-november-22-2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112205522/https://www.philstar.com/nation/2018/11/13/1868052/p25-wage-hike-takes-effect-november-22-2018 |archive-date=November 12, 2018 |access-date=November 15, 2018 |website=philstar.com}}</ref>

Nominal wages are what Metro Manila's current minimum wage rates are known as. The Philippine government has set these wage rates at a fixed amount. 

On the other hand, the amount after [[inflation]] is what is considered the real minimum wage. For instance, the non-agricultural employees of NCR typically receive ₱428.23 (${{To USD|428.23|round=2|Philippines}}) per day as opposed to ₱537 (${{To USD|537|round=2|Philippines}}). The minimum salary for agricultural employees in Manila (including plantation and non-plantation workers) is {{Philippine peso|398.72}} (${{To USD|398.72|round=2|Philippines}}) after accounting for inflation.

===Central business districts===

[[File:Ortigas at Night - Flickr.jpg|thumb|[[Ortigas Center]] in the eastern part of Metro Manila.]]
Metro Manila has many central business districts (CBD), which categorizes it under the [[multiple nuclei model]] in [[human geography]] terms. The most prominent CBDs are the [[Makati Central Business District]], [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Ortigas Center]], [[Binondo]], and [[Filinvest City]]. The region also has plenty of [[mixed-use development]]s owned and developed by private corporations such as the [[Ayala Corporation]], [[LT Group|Eton Properties]], [[Megaworld Corporation]] and [[SM Prime Holdings]].

The [[Makati Central Business District]] is the premier business and commercial center of the Philippines. It is the headquarters to most of the multinational corporations residing in the Philippines as well as the country's biggest commercial firms and BPO companies.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Working in the Philippines |url=http://www.makeitmakati.com/about-the-city/working-in-the-philippines |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427180723/http://www.makeitmakati.com/about-the-city/working-in-the-philippines |archive-date=April 27, 2013 |access-date=March 5, 2015 |publisher=Make it Makati}}</ref> The Central Business District has an office stock of 1.1&nbsp;million square meters of Grade A and premium office space.<ref name="Fort Bonifacio">{{Cite news |last=Roderick T. dela Cruz |date=January 3, 2015 |title=Fort Bonifacio eclipsing Makati CBD |work=Manila Standard Today |url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2015/01/03/fort-bonifacio-eclipsing-makati-cbd/ |url-status=dead |access-date=March 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711091224/http://manilastandardtoday.com/2015/01/03/fort-bonifacio-eclipsing-makati-cbd |archive-date=July 11, 2015}}</ref> It is the home to the [[List of tallest buildings in Metro Manila|tallest skyscrapers in the region]] as well as [[List of tallest buildings in the Philippines|in the country]].

[[Bonifacio Global City]] is the newest business district of Manila and is the premier financial and lifestyle center of the metropolis. It is located in the north-western part of [[Taguig]]. It used to be a military base known as [[Fort Bonifacio]]. The Bases and Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) privatized the property and its income from the sale was intended to be used for the modernization of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. Upon its privatization, the place was transformed into a business hub featuring numerous tourist attractions such as [[The Mind Museum]], high-end shops, towering office skyscrapers, and luxurious lofts and condominiums. Bonifacio Global City will soon overtake the [[Makati Central Business District]] as the premier financial center of the country in the future. One of the reasons for it is that the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] will relocate its headquarters in BGC. Also, it has more spaces and land for future developments. It is also the most active business district, generating over 50 percent of the growth in property market and has more available space for rent or lease and sale than Makati.<ref name="Fort Bonifacio" />

[[Ortigas Center]] is a central business district located in [[Mandaluyong]] and [[Pasig]], with a small portion of it located in [[Quezon City]]. Landmarks in Ortigas include the [[EDSA Shrine]], [[Shangri-La Plaza (shopping mall)|Shangri-La Plaza]] and the [[SM Megamall]]. Furthermore, [[The Medical City]] has its main campus in Ortigas Center. Important financial and national institutions headquartered in Ortigas are the [[Asian Development Bank]], [[Union Bank of the Philippines]] and the [[National Economic and Development Authority]]. Ortigas is also the home to the headquarters of [[San Miguel Corporation]], [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]], [[Lopez Group of Companies]] and [[Meralco|The Manila Electric Company]].

====Roads and highways====
{{Main|List of roads in Metro Manila}}
[[File:EDSA-Kamung Sept 2021.jpg|thumb|A flyover on [[EDSA]] in Quezon City.]]
[[File:SLEX and Elevated Extension Southbound 2023-04-05.jpg|thumb|Southern tip of [[Metro Manila Skyway|Skyway]] at the [[South Luzon Expressway]] in Muntinlupa.]]

The roads of Metro Manila are built around the [[Manila|City of Manila]]. Roads are classified as local, national or subdivision roads. There are ten radial roads branching out from the city. Also there are five circumferential roads forming a series of concentric semi-circular arcs around Manila. The circumferential and radial roads are systems of interconnected roads, bridges and highways. A problem with the circumferential roads are the missing road links. These are the roads that are not yet constructed to give way for development due to Metro Manila's rapid urbanization. The metropolis is resolving this problem through the completion of missing road links or through the construction of connector roads.

The radial and circumferential road system are being supplanted by a new numbered highway system implemented by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]], and new signage are being placed with its implementation. Expressways are being assigned numbers with the E prefix. National roads are assigned 1 to 3 digit numbers, except for those classified as tertiary national roads.

An important circumferential road is the [[Circumferential Road 4]], with the [[EDSA|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] as its major component. It traverses the cities of [[Pasay]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Quezon City]] and [[Caloocan]]. [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|Line 3]] follows the alignment of EDSA, from [[Taft Avenue]] in [[Pasay]] up to [[TriNoma]], terminating before it reaches [[Caloocan]]. [[Circumferential Road 5]] serves the people near the regional limits of Metro Manila and also serves as an alternate route for Circumferential Road 4.

Prominent radial roads include the Radial Road 1, composed of [[Roxas Boulevard]] and the [[Manila–Cavite Expressway]] (Coastal Road) that connects Metro Manila to [[Cavite]], Radial Road 3 or the [[South Luzon Expressway]] that connects Metro Manila to [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], Radial Road 6, composed of [[Aurora Boulevard]] and [[Marikina–Infanta Highway|Marcos Highway]] that runs up to [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] and Radial Road 8 or the [[North Luzon Expressway]] that serves as the gateway to the north.

The [[Skyway (Metro Manila)|Skyway]] serves as the region's main [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]], directly connecting the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway. It also enables access to Ninoy Aquino International Airport via the [[NAIA Expressway]] (NAIAX). The Skyway is the first fully grade-separated highway in the [[Philippines]] and one of the longest elevated highways in the world with a total length of approximately {{convert|42.79|km|mi|sp=us}}. Other expressways such as the Manila–Cavite Expressway and [[Muntinlupa–Cavite Expressway]] also connect Metro Manila to its surrounding areas.

The development of roads, highways and expressways are based on the [[Metro Manila Dream Plan]]. Ongoing projects in the dream plan include the rehabilitation of EDSA, [[CAVITEX–C-5 Link]], [[NLEX Connector]], and the construction of the missing road links for the circumferential roads.

[[File:Metro Manila rail network.svg|thumb|System map of the Metro Manila railway system.]]Rail transportation in the Greater Manila Area is a major part of the [[Transportation in Metro Manila|transportation system]] in Metro Manila and [[Greater Manila Area|its surrounding areas]]. It consists of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System]], [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System]], and the [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]]. As of 2021, the three systems and its four operational lines combined has [[List of rail transit stations in the Greater Manila Area|82 stations]], covering a total of {{convert|113.3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. The network makes up the majority of active railways in the country and bear the brunt of providing the metropolis with rail as a faster alternative mode of transport other than [[bus]]es and [[jeepney]]s. However, these systems are currently insufficient for the rapidly expanding metropolis; to address this, new lines and line extensions are under construction, which will extend the system far out into neighboring regions.<ref name=":23">{{Cite web |last=Times |first=The Manila |date=March 9, 2021 |title=Praiseworthy progress in commuter rail infrastructure |url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/03/09/opinion/editorial/praiseworthy-progress-in-commuter-rail-infrastructure/848945 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210324073538/https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/03/09/opinion/editorial/praiseworthy-progress-in-commuter-rail-infrastructure/848945/ |archive-date=March 24, 2021 |access-date=July 13, 2021 |website=The Manila Times |language=en}}</ref>

Bus franchises in the region are regulated by the [[Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (Philippines)|Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board]]. The [[Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service]] is the express bus system that runs from its dispatch terminal in Fairview up to the central business districts along [[EDSA]]. It aims to cut travel time substantially and provide a faster, safer and more convenient bus service to commuters, who are usually caught at the heavy traffic across the metropolis.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 23, 2015 |title=Express buses get underway on EDSA |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/457517/news/metromanila/express-buses-get-underway-on-edsa |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614191716/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/457517/news/metromanila/express-buses-get-underway-on-edsa |archive-date=June 14, 2015 |access-date=May 22, 2015 |publisher=GMA News Online}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=March 20, 2015 |title=Gov't to launch express bus system in Metro Manila |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Nation&title=govt-to-launch-express-bus-system-in-metro-manila&id=104760 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705130637/http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Nation&title=govt-to-launch-express-bus-system-in-metro-manila&id=104760 |archive-date=July 5, 2018 |access-date=May 22, 2015 |publisher=BusinessWorld Online}}</ref> A second express bus link from SM North EDSA, [[Trinoma]] and SM Megamall to Makati opened in December 2015, and by January 2016 was the line on which, for the first time in nearly three decades, a [[double-decker bus]] traveled on EDSA, to the delight of motorists, followed by a third link, this time from [[Robinsons Galleria]] to the [[Ayala Center]] complex in February 2016 and a fourth in March linking the Ayala Center to the Alabang Town Center in Muntinlupa via the Metro Manila Skyway (and later to Ayala Malls South Park). As of the present express buses also link the Market Market mall and Circuit Makati to both the Nuvali residential township and the Pacita Village complex in San Pedro, both in Laguna, in services launched in 2014 and 2017, respectively (plus additional services to the UP Town Mall in Quezon City and SM Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal), while intercity express buses have been in operation since 2015 to alleviate traffic on EDSA.

{{Main|Pasig River Ferry Service}}

The [[Pasig River Ferry Service]] run by the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] is the principal [[ferry]] shuttle system of Metro Manila. It traverses the [[Pasig River]] from Barangay Pinagbuhatan in [[Pasig]] to Plaza Mexico in [[Intramuros]]. Although it was referred to as a [[ferry]], it is more akin to a [[water taxi|water bus]]. It has 17 stations, but only 14 are operational. Another ferry route called the Manila-Bataan Ferry was launched on May 10, 2017, and traverses [[Manila Bay]] from the Bay Terminal at [[Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex|CCP Complex]] in Manila to [[Orion, Bataan]]. A new ferry route known as the Cavite-Manila Ferry Service that runs between [[Noveleta]], [[Cavite]] and [[Intramuros]] was launched in January 2018.

[[Meralco]] is the sole electric distributor of Metro Manila. It generates its power from the [[National Power Corporation]] and other independent power producers in [[Luzon]]. The [[Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]] (MWSS) was responsible for the supply and delivery of potable water and the sewerage system in Metro Manila. It was [[Water privatization in Metro Manila|privatized in 1997]] and the region and its immediate surrounding areas were split into the east and west concession. The winning corporations provide the same function of MWSS.

The [[Maynilad Water Services]] took over the west zone, which is composed of [[Manila]] (excluding the southeastern part of the city), [[Caloocan]], [[Las Piñas]], [[Malabon]], [[Muntinlupa]], [[Navotas]], [[Parañaque]], [[Pasay]] and [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]]. It also operates in some parts of [[Makati]] and [[Quezon City]]. [[Manila Water]] operates on the east zone, comprising the cities of [[Mandaluyong]], [[Marikina]], [[Pasig]], [[Pateros]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Taguig]]. It also operates in large areas of Makati and Quezon City and the southeastern part of Manila, which was excluded from the west zone.

For garbage hauling, the region spent ₱4.221&nbsp;billion ($93.855&nbsp;million) in 2013. Quezon City spent the most at ₱994.59&nbsp;million ($22.115&nbsp;million) while Pateros, the region's only municipality, spent the least money on garbage at ₱9.478&nbsp;million ($210,747).<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 6, 2014 |title=Metro Manila spent P4.2B to get rid of 2013 garbage |work=Rappler |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/71151-garbage-hauling-expenses-metro-manila |url-status=live |access-date=March 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222221547/http://www.rappler.com/nation/71151-garbage-hauling-expenses-metro-manila |archive-date=December 22, 2014}}</ref>
