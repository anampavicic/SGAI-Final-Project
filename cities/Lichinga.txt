'''Lichinga''' is the capital [[List of cities in Mozambique|city]] of [[Niassa Province]] of [[Mozambique]].  It lies on the [[Lichinga Plateau]] at an altitude of {{Convert|1360|m||abbr=}}, east of [[Lake Niassa]] (Lake Malawi).  The town was founded as '''Vila Cabral''' as a farming and military settlement. It is served by [[Lichinga Airport]]. The province borders [[Ruvuma Region]] in [[Tanzania]].

==History==
===Early history===
The region that is Niassa province is the ancestral homeland of the [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] and [[Makua people|Makua]].  
===Portuguese rule===
Founded by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonial administration in 1931 as Vila Cabral,<ref>[http://www.niassatourism.com/section-uklichinga/ www.niassatourism.com], Retrieved on June 14, 2008</ref> the town was designed to become a fast growth urban centre, its streets and avenues paying attention to a projected future growth. Vila Cabral was upgraded to city status in 1962. In the early 1960s its population was 27,000 inhabitants; by 1970 it had 36,715. The city developed as an agriculture and colonial service centre until the independence of Mozambique from Portugal in 1975. In addition, the town's economy included [[forestry]]-based activities and was surrounded by a [[pine]] [[tree plantation]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Do outro lado do tempo: Moçambique antes de 1975 VERSÂO COMPLETA |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igQEvBShfu0 |access-date=2023-04-08 |language=en}}</ref>

===After independence from Portugal===
After independence the new government renamed the city Lichinga. The effects of 17 years of [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] (1975-1992) spread famine and disease in Mozambique resulting in many deaths and refugees in the region around Lichinga.

==Climate==
Owing to its high altitude location the town experiences a moderate [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with cool weather in the dry season (May to September) and average temperatures of {{Convert|15.5|C||abbr=}} in July. Summertime is October to April with the hottest weather in November: average temperature {{Convert|22|C||abbr=}}. This is also the season of heavy rain especially December to March. The annual rainfall is {{Convert|1171|mm||abbr=on}}.
