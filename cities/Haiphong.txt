Historically, Haiphong is the first place in Vietnam and [[Mainland Southeast Asia]] to get [[electricity]].

In the imperial era of [[Đại Việt]], the [[Bạch Đằng River]] in Haiphong was a place of many legendary victories, led by now-legendary commanders [[Ngô Quyền]] and [[Trần Hưng Đạo]]. In the 16th century, [[Mạc dynasty]] has promoted the coastal settlement as a secondary capital, growing to become an important port town of [[Đàng Ngoài]]. After the [[French conquest of Vietnam]], in 1888, the president of the [[French Third Republic]], [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], promulgated a decree to establish Haiphong as one of the principal cities of the [[French Indochina]]. From 1954 to 1975, Haiphong served as the most important maritime city of [[North Vietnam]]. It was one of directly controlled municipalities of a reunified Vietnam with [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in 1976. In the 21st century, Haiphong is under active [[land reclamation]], the most recent effort being the construction of [[South Đình Vũ dike]] in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-17 |title=Hơn 2.200 tỉ đồng xây dựng đê biển Nam Đình Vũ, Hải Phòng |url=https://tuoitre.vn/hon-2-200-ti-dong-xay-dung-de-bien-nam-dinh-vu-hai-phong-20221117160539958.htm |access-date=2024-01-09 |website=TUOI TRE ONLINE |language=vi}}</ref>

Haiphong is a popular seaside vacation spot and known for biological reservations in [[Cát Bà Island]]. For its extensive port, the city hosts the headquarter of [[Vietnam People's Navy]]. [[Royal poinciana]] are commonly associated with Haiphong in Vietnamese culture.

==History==

===Dynastic Vietnam===
Mordern-day Haiphong was the home of Lê Chân, one of the female generals under the command of the [[Trưng Sisters]] who rose against Chinese domination in 40 AD and ruled until their defeat in 43 AD. Lê Chân was known to have established the ''Hải tần Phòng thủ'' (“Defenced Sea-coast”) during the war against general [[Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)|Ma Yuan]] of the [[Han dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://anhp.vn/nu-tuong-le-chan--va-dau-an-hai-tan-phong-thu-d24921.html | title=Nữ tướng Lê Chân và dấu ấn Hải Tần Phòng Thủ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://haiphong.gov.vn/tin-tuc-su-kien/Chuong-trinh-FamtripHai-tan-Phong-thu---Goc-nhin-moi-tiep-tuc-gioi-thieu-nhieu-dia-danh-lich-su-va-am-thuc-Hai-Phong-87096.html | title=Chương trình Famtrip"Hải tần Phòng thủ - Góc nhìn mới" tiếp tục giới thiệu nhiều địa danh lịch sử và ẩm thực Hải Phòng &#124; Cổng Thông tin điện tử thành phố Hải phòng }}</ref> 
Centuries later under the reign of [[Nguyễn dynasty|Nguyễn]] Emperor [[Tự Đức]], the area earned the appellation: '''''Hải'''-Dương thương-chính quan-'''phòng''''' ("The trading defensive area of [[Hải Dương Province]]").

[[File:Rue chinoise, Haiphong, Tonkin.jpg|thumb|left|A street in the late 19th century]]
By the 19th century, at the end of Tự Đức's reign, the [[Hang Kenh|Hang Kenh Communal House]] in what is now the city's [[Le Chan District]] was made the administrative seat of [[An Dương District]], restoring its regional importance.<ref name="hphtourism-culture">[http://www.haiphongtourism.gov.vn/about-hai-phong/haiphongs-culture/a.html Haiphong's Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629061433/http://www.haiphongtourism.gov.vn/about-hai-phong/haiphongs-culture/a.html |date=2017-06-29 }}. HaiphongTourism.gov.vn</ref> The area by then had developed into a sizable commercial port.

At the eve of the French conquest in 1881, a [[1881 Haiphong typhoon|typhoon]] ravaged the area, killing about 3,000 people in and around Haiphong. Despite the damages, Haiphong was developed by the French to serve as [[French Indochina|Indochina]]'s main naval base over the ensuing decades.

===Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam War===
{{See also|Operation Rolling Thunder|Operation Linebacker |Operation Linebacker II}}

Following the defeat of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in [[World War II]], Vietnamese nationalists agitated for independence against French return. French forces landed in Haiphong and encountered resistance which resulted in the deaths of three French soldiers. In retaliation, the French ships, among them the cruiser [[French cruiser Suffren|''Suffren'']], [[Haiphong incident|shelled the city]], setting it ablaze<ref>''Vietnam'' by [[Spencer C. Tucker]], page 47. "On 23 November DebeS delivered an ultimatum to the Vietnamese at Haiphong, ordering them to withdraw from the French section of the city, the Chinese quarter, and the port. He gave them only two hours to reply. When the time was up the French subjected the Vietnamese positions to air, land, and sea bombardment, the bulk of the firepower coming from the three- and eight-inch guns of the French Navy Cruiser Suffren. Only military targets were destroyed and not the Vietnamese quarter as some have claimed. Estimates of the number killed in the shelling and ensuing panic vary widely. Casualties up to 20,000 have been cited. French Admiral Battet later said that no more than 6,000 Vietnamese had died, but in 1981 [[Vũ Quốc Uy|Vu Quoc Uy]], then chairman of the Haiphong municipal committee, told Stanley Karnow that the figure was only 500 to 1,000 dead. Others have put the figure as low as 200".</ref> and precipitating the [[First Indochina War]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Maurice Vaïsse, ''L'Armée française dans la guerre d'Indochine (1946–1954) : Adaptation ou inadaptation'', 2000, p. 276</ref><ref>Plon, ''Le General de Gaulle et l'Indochine 1940–1946'', page 210. "In connection with the naval bombardment, let us note that only the ships of small tonnage could go up the river of Haiphong. On November 23, two colonial sloops supported for the first time the French troops with their artillery to a limited effect: the Chevreuil with its double turret, with its two pairs of 100mm, Savorgnan de Brazza with its four turrets each of one 138mm. No battleship was present. On November 27 on that the evening, the cruiser Suffren was in the Bay d' Along, its tidal water prohibiting it access of the Cua Cam. It transported troops in reinforcement..."</ref> French infantry forces under the command of [[Jean-Étienne Valluy]] entered the city, fighting [[house-to-house fighting|house to house]] with the support of armored units and airplanes.<ref>Phillippe Devillers, ''Histoire du Viêt-Nam de 1940 à 1952''. Editions du Seuil, Paris. Third edition,1952, pp. 331–340</ref>

Late in the [[Vietnam War]], Haiphong was subjected to heavy bombing by [[US Navy]] and [[US Air Force|Air Force]] [[strike aircraft]] because it was [[North Vietnam]]'s only major port. U.S. Admiral [[Thomas Moorer|Thomas H. Moorer]] ordered the [[Operation Pocket Money|mining of Haiphong harbor]] on 8 May 1972, effectively sealing the port. Until it was lifted, the mining caused no casualty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-59ce8c-interview-with-thomas-h-moorer-1981|title=Vietnam: A Television History; Interview with Thomas H.

==Economy==
Haiphong is a major economic center of the North in particular and Vietnam in general both. Under French domination, Haiphong was level 1 city, equal to Saigon and Hanoi. The last years of the 19th century, the French had proposed to build Haiphong into the economic capital of Indochina.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hoaphuongdo.vn/news/tin-tuc-su-kien/kinh-te-doanh-nghiep/46701-lien-ket-phat-trien-giua-ha-noi-va-hai-phong-dong-vai-tro-quan-trong.html |title=Liên kết phát triển giữa Hà Nội và Hải Phòng đóng vai trò quan trọng |access-date=2016-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905025623/http://www.hoaphuongdo.vn/news/tin-tuc-su-kien/kinh-te-doanh-nghiep/46701-lien-ket-phat-trien-giua-ha-noi-va-hai-phong-dong-vai-tro-quan-trong.html |archive-date=2011-09-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Industry===
Industry is a key sector in Haiphong including food processing, light industries and heavy industries. Major products include fish sauce, beer, cigarettes, textiles, paper, plastic pipes, cement, iron, pharmaceuticals, electric fans, motorbikes, steel pipes and ships and out-sourcing software implementation.<ref name="GSO09"/> Most of these industries have been growing significantly between 2000 and 2007, with the exceptions of the cigarette and pharmaceutical industries. Shipbuilding, steel pipes, plastic pipes and textiles are among the industries with the most rapid growth.<ref name="GSO09"/>

There are also growing industries supplying products used by existing industries in the city. PetroVietnam set up a joint-venture PVTex with textile manufacturer [[Vinatex]] to build Vietnam's first polyester fiber plant in Haiphong. The factory will use by-products from oil-refining and reduce reliance on imported materials.<ref>{{Cite news| title = PVTex to operate first polyester fiber project early 2011| newspaper = The Saigon Times| url = http://english.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/business/other/10257/| date = 2010-05-14| access-date = 2011-07-06| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111006070103/http://english.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/business/other/10257/| archive-date = 2011-10-06| url-status = dead}}</ref> 270,600 people were employed in Haiphong's industry. 112,600 industrial jobs were created between 2000 and 2007.<ref name="GSO09" />

==== Agriculture, forestry and fishery ====

Despite its status as a city, around one third of Haiphong's area or 52,300 ha (as of 2007) are used for agriculture. Rice is the most important crop, taking up around 80% of the agricultural land with an output of 463,100 tons in 2007.<ref name="GSO09">General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities, Vietnam''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Other agricultural products include maize, sugar and peanuts.<ref name="GSO09" />

Haiphong has a relatively large fishing sector with an output of 79,705 tons (2007). Gross output has almost doubled between 2000 and 2007, mostly due to fast growth in aquaculture, which made up 60% of gross output in 2007. Despite its coastal location, sea fish contribute relatively little to the sector (around one fourth). [[Nam Định Province]] and [[Thái Bình Province]] have much larger fishing sectors and even the inland [[Hải Dương Province]] has a larger gross output from fishing than Haiphong.<ref name="GSO09" />

As of 2007, 315,500 were employed in agriculture and fishery, a significant decrease from 396,300 in 2000. However, these sectors still account for almost a third of total employment in Haiphong, a larger share than industry.<ref name="GSO09" /> However, gross output in both agriculture and fishery have been growing significantly between 2000 and 2007.

==Cuisine==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2024}}
Hai Phong cuisine is known throughout Vietnam for seafood dishes. Seafood restaurants in the Do Son area are known for having very fresh and affordable shrimp, crab, fish, and squid. The style of seafood processing in Hai Phong follows a simple style, emphasizing the essence and freshness of ingredients themselves as opposed to the seasoning.

Dishes such as bánh đa cua (red noodle soup with crab), bún cá (fish rice noodle soup), bánh mỳ que cay (spicy stick-bread), cơm cháy hải sản (crispy rice cracker with seafood), nem cua bể (square crab spring rolls) are notable and popular dishes. These dishes can be found on the streets of other places like Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, but enjoying them on the Flamboyant City (the other name of Haiphong City) is still the most ideal because of the choice of raw ingredients and cooking secrets of local chefs. Hai Phong cuisine has been promoted to Europe at the [[Brest Maritime Festival#2008 edition|Brest Maritime Festival 2008]] (France) and resonated greatly.

In addition, Hai Phong also has many other dishes such as mantis shrimp hot pot, bean sprouts salad, sủi dìn, bánh bèo (Haiphong's version, which is different from Hue's version).
