== Etymology ==
[[File:Debret em Ponta Grossa.jpg|thumb|left|Landscape portrayed by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret|Debret]], in the back shows the old village in 1820, it is noted that the referred high hill surrounded by some forest ahead a vast region dominated by fields]]
The place where it is located has a [[Toponymy|toponymia]] related to a hill seen long distance during trips to the Campos Gerais.<ref name=":9" /> The name would have originated from a high hill that stood out before the whole pastures landscape by its prominent height and the capo of bush that covers it. The tropeiros to refer to its location said that they were near Ponta Grossa. But other stories have the same idea, like that of the foreman when he tells the farmer the place chosen to establish his farm, "there at ''Ponta Grossa''". Or even that the name had seen later when the owner ceded the lands for [[Settlement geography|settlement]].<ref name=":1" />

Ponta Grossa was founded on the farm of Miguel da Rocha Ferreira Carvalhaes who chose it as favorable [[agricultural land]]. The farm still exists towards [[Castro, Paraná|Castro]].<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pontagrossa.pr.gov.br/origem|title=Origem do Nome|last=imprensa|website=www.pontagrossa.pr.gov.br|access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> In 1871 the city came to be called Pitangui, but the following year it resumed its original name.

== History ==
According to the historian Paulo Eduardo Dias de Mello the earliest account of European activity in this area is of the ''tropeiros'' who travelled with their wares towards the fair of [[Sorocaba]]. Ponta Grossa served as a resting point since 1703 of the long voyages that left [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. Along the way was commercialized the charque, where the meat was preserved only with salt. Unlike other [[Settlement geography|settlements]], Ponta Grossa was not inhabited, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous groups]] occupied places to the north, with expansion, conflicts later came with [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlers]], such as that of the city of [[Reserva, Paraná|Reserva]], but outside the [[Urban area|urban space]] of the city in question. Another version, but not necessarily contradictory, states that the farmers of the area would launch a couple of pigeons and where these birds would land would mark the beginning of the ''[[Freguesia]]'' with the construction of the chapel Mrs. [[Saint Anne]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.arede.info/ponta-grossa/172659/historiador-conta-sobre-a-origem-de-ponta-grossa|title=Historiador conta sobre a origem de Ponta Grossa|date=15 September 2017|work=A Rede|access-date=2 September 2018|language=pt-BR}}</ref>

=== Colonial Expeditions ===
Ponta Grossa had its territory traversed from the 16th century, when the Campos Gerais were crossed by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] expeditions that demanded of the [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] coast until [[Asunción]], in [[Paraguay]]. Later it was successively moved on account of the ''[[Bandeirantes|seiscentistas bandeirantes]]'', notably for capture of the natives.<ref name=":5" /> [[Bandeirantes|Portuguese bandeirantes]] like [[Aleixo Garcia]] passed in 1525, five years later Peró Lobo and Francisco Chaves. In 1541 passed the Spaniard [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca|Álvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca]] who had some conflicts of tribes not too distant. Also, it is reported the passage of a non-Iberian: [[Ulrich Schmidl|Ulrich Schmidel]], a German mercenary in Spanish service, that during the course of his travels in the region brought 20 Paraguayan [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] and four other mercenary German soldiers in Spanish service from the current paulista coast.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecities.com.br/artigo/Brasil/Paran%C3%A1/Ponta-Grossa/Hist%C3%B3ria/1041/|title=História de Ponta Grossa {{!}} The Cities|website=www.thecities.com.br|language=pt|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>

''Tropeiros'', people who used mules and donkeys to transport goods (normally called muleteers in English) used the region as a route,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.conceitosertanejo.com.br/voce-sabe-o-que-sao-tropeiros-e-a-sua-importancia/|title=Você sabe o que são tropeiros e a sua importância? {{!}} Conceito Sertanejo|date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903173253/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3ArEnlnryrv6IJ%3Awww.conceitosertanejo.com.br%2Fvoce-sabe-o-que-sao-tropeiros-e-a-sua-importancia%2F+&cd=14&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-date=3 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> the landscape in the form of a field became welcome to pass with mules and in the future cattle ranching.

At a later point some former ''tropeiros'' settled in the area and began to farm. Much of the products from these new farms was used for the feeding of animals used by the muleteers. Other muleteers settled down and started farming because events like floods disrupted the distribution of their goods and so they had to take their losses and began new activities.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pontagrossa.pr.gov.br/historia|title=História da Cidade|last=imprensa|website=www.pontagrossa.pr.gov.br|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref> Preferably, the ''tropeiros'' chose to settle near the banks of the Verde and Pitangui River.<ref name=":6" />

These new farmers caused a need for trade which lead to the creation of villages. There were also settlements called  ''[[freguesia]]s''. The later is the word used originally to describe  Ponta Grossa and other cities in the region.<ref name=":7" />

The actual possession of the land, for purposes of occupation and [[colonization]], which resulted in the founding of the city of Ponta Grossa, took place from 1800, about a century or more after the area began having regular visits from muleteers.

===Beginnings of organized settlement===
When the settlement first began the Campos Gerais were under the [[jurisdiction]] of Vila Nova de [[Castro, Paraná|Castro]].<ref name=":5">FERREIRA, João Carlos Vicente (1996). ''O Paraná e seus municípios''. [[Maringá]]: Memória Brasileira Publish Company. 535 pages</ref>

The first settlers who settled here were farmers from the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. They chose this area due to the abundance of natural pastures and the beauty of the Campos Gerais. They settled in the environs of the rivers Verde and Pitangui. Shortly after [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]] of the Monastery of the Saints obtained grant of these fields, that called Santa Bárbara Farm. However, in 1813, the interim governor of the [[São Paulo (state)|Province of São Paulo]], [[D. Matheus Abreu Pereira]], donated these same lands to the lieutenant [[Atanagildo Pinto Martins]], a [[Bandeirantes|bandeirante]] from Paraná who traveled through and surveyed the way of the Fields of [[Palmas, Paraná|Palms]]. The [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]] protested, claiming acquired rights, presenting the Term  of concession, but nothing of value was worth the appeals, finishing the immense area in possession of ''bandeirante'' Atanagildo.<ref name=":5" />

=== Fixed Settlements ===
[[File:Tropeiro.jpg|thumb|[[w:pt:Tropeiro|Tropeirismo]] remained in the early twentieth century]]
It was not long before, and he was lord of the Campos Gerais, the [[Captain general|Captain-General]] José Góes e Moraes. Along with Pedro Taques de Almeida (besides others of noble lineage) that required territories between the left bank of the [[Itararé River|Itarare River]] and the [[River source|headwaters]] of the [[Tibagi River]],<ref name=":7" /> they donated part of his lands to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who in the vicinity of São Miguel Riverside, a tributary of the Pitangui River, erected the Santa Bárbara do Pitangui Chapel. where they established the [[Curate|Curato]] of the [[Society of Jesus|Company of Jesus]] that in no time knew extraordinary progress.<ref name=":5" /> But the route of the main road was diverted, causing a stagnation of the growth of the city where the first built chapel.<ref name=":6" />

At the same time, the fields were systematically occupied, with the emergence of large cattle ranches.

One important project of this time was  the Bom Sucesso Farm. It was established by  [[Sergeant major|sergeant-major]] Miguel da Rocha Ferreira Carvalhães. The farm covered the area that today constitutes the urban perimeter of Ponta Grossa.<ref name=":5" />

Prior to 1750 when the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]] was signed, Ponta Grossa was in theory part of the [[Spanish Empire]], but the Spanish do not seem to have exercised much actual cobtrol in the region.<ref name=":15">{{Cite thesis|last=Kohlrausch|first=Arlindo Jonas Fagundes|title=Introdução à história da arquitetura de Ponta Grossa / PR: as casas de madeira – 1920 a 1950|date=22 March 2007|publisher=Universidade de Sao Paulo Sistema Integrado de Bibliotecas – SIBiUSP|url=http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/16/16133/tde-19052010-102628/pt-br.php|doi=10.11606/D.16.2007.tde-19052010-102628|language=pt-br|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Santa Bárbara chapel, constructed by [[Jesuit reduction]]s to the control of the [[Government of Spain|Spanish government]] was used by oratory by the ''tropeiros'' and travelers of Campos Gerais from 1727 by donation of [[Semaria|sesmaria]] of Itaiacoca or the Pitangui. With the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]], what did not continue with the catechization and [[slavery]], even with religious groups that came later. Not far from the farm, in the 1970s human [[bone]]s were found possibly from the slaves of the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.histedbr.fe.unicamp.br/acer_histedbr/jornada/jornada6/resumos/769.htm|title=MEMÓRIA E HISTÓRIA: CAPELA SANTA BÁRBARA DO PITANGUI|website=www.histedbr.fe.unicamp.br|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref>

Where today is the [[St. Ann Cathedral, Ponta Grossa|Metropolitan Cathedral]], there was a ranch of inn, erected by ''tropeiros'', next to a centenary fig tree, under which they planted a cross. It was there the point of stop of troops and travelers. Another point of reference at this time was the ''Casa de Telhas'' (in English: ''House of Tiles''), constructed by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] for relate with people of the region. In this house were celebrated the offices of the [[sacrament]] and religious festivals. In a short time, around the ''Casa de Telhas'' appeared the first huts.<ref name=":5" /> In addition to serving as Church to hold celebrations was a place of rest. It is believed that the construction of the same was an attempt to press the elevation of Ponta Grossa, until then a neighborhood of [[Castro, Paraná|Castro]] to a ''[[freguesia]]''. A cemetery and a chapel had also been built. It is he historic moment than the version of the pigeons appears for the choice of place due to divergence between the farmers,<ref name=":6" /> described in the sequence.

Domingos Teixeira Lobo, Antonio da Rocha Carvalhães and Benedito Mariano Fernandes Ribas were three early settlers who saw a need to give the settlement a clear legal distinction.

They felt this would solve the difficulties of [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] matters and civil litigation, since they were under the far off jurisdiction to Vila Nova de [[Castro, Paraná|Castro]]. It is reported that Carvalhães would have ordered his foreman, Francisco Mulato, to look for a suitable place in the Boa Vista winter estate to start a new settlement. The place chosen would have been the current suburb of Boa Vista. When fulfilling the mission Francisco Mulato would have said "''Sinhô'' knows well because it is leaning in that capon that has the thick tip".<ref name=":5" />
[[File:Capela Sta Barbara.jpg|left|thumb|Santa Bárbara Chapel, where the settlement would begin before the change of location.]]

Having approved the name but not the location, the group of farmers decided that the place of the future settlement would be where a white pigeon with a red ribbon bow on the neck, loose in the [[prairie]]s, would stay overnight. After many flocks, the bird landed exactly on the cross of the ranch of the ''tropeiros'', under the centenary [[Ficus|fig tree]] existing there, having been interpreted as a good omen and predestination, for the effective settlement of Ponta Grossa.<ref name=":5" /> A chapel was built with the help of the inhabitants there, being here the central focus of growth of the old village.

Although the above account exists in folklore there are no contemporary documents that support this as the actual origin of the city.

The dove is used as a [[symbol]] by the [[Municipality|municipal government]] appearing in the [[anthem]], the [[flag]], the [[coat of arms]] and the march.<ref name=":9" /> Some sources give the name Estrela, as an early name of Ponta Grossa, "because it could be seen of some leagues of distance, situated in the middle of the fields, on an eminence as the present city is still" (Land of the Future – Nestor Victor).<ref name=":5" />

=== Consolidation ===

It was not until after 1800 that Pinta Grossa became a city. Until then it was an agrarian environment inhabited mainly by subsistence farmers. ''Criatório'' (where the cattle are handled) and ''invernagem'' (rest period of animals) stimulated trade. So that the farmer "returns" to becomes ''tropeiro'' again. Through the agriculture do not effective and as consequence the urbanization process is slow.<ref name=":7" />

On 15 September 1823, through the [[Empire of Brazil|Imperial]] license, the ''[[Freguesia]]'' of Estrela was created. The first vicar of the locality was father Joaquim Pereira da Fonseca. In 1840 the patrimony was increased, by area denominated Rincão of the Round and donated by Domingos Ferreira Pinto. By the Provincial Law nº 34, of 7 April 1855, the municipality of Ponta Grossa was created, with territory split out of the municipality of [[Castro, Paraná|Castro]], being duly installed on 6 December of the same year. The Provincial Law nº 82, of 24 March 1862, elevated the town to the category of city.

On 15 April 1871, through Law 281, it was renamed Pitangui. Very shortly after that it was named Ponta Grossa on 5 April 1872. Ponta Grossa passed the seat of [[Comarca]] on 18 April 1876, by Law No. 469, and was installed on 16 December of it, assuming on this date as the first Judge Conrado Ericksen.<ref name=":5" />

=== Ecology ===
[[File:NDVI 2017-09-10.png|left|thumb|[[Normalized difference vegetation index|NDVI]] applied to the urban area during a drought at the end of winter 2017]]
In ecological terms it is diversified. The composition and [[species]] varies according to [[Climate|climatic]], [[Pedology|pedological]] and [[Geological formation|rock formation]]. The [[Biome|biota]] differs from region to region. One of the [[ecosystem]]s found are of field vegetation similar to North American [[prairie]]s. Tree vegetation is rare, usually dominated by [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]]. Sometimes it is interspersed with [[shrub]]s. Covering an area of 22,800 ha in 1996.<ref name=":10" /> The origin goes back to the own sandstone units found in the urban and rural environment.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=http://www.uepg.br/natural/relatoriofinal.pdf|title=Characterization of the natural heritage of the Campos Gerais of Paraná|website=[[State University of Ponta Grossa|UEPG]]|access-date=4 September 2018}}</ref> The trampling of the herds is responsible for the modification of the location and quantity of [[species]] that live in these fields. The renovation of the [[pasture]] is done by the [[slash-and-burn]], a technique used a long time ago. Other paradigms for the original conservation of the vegetation is the inclusion of some species with seeds, decharacterizing the original phytogeographic region. The backing for affirmative is also indicated for the presence of [[Agribusiness|agroindustries]]. Part of the lack of conservation is to for consider the fields as a monotonous vegetation without diversity.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Meneguzzo|first1=Isonel Sandino|last2=Albuquerque|first2=Edu Silvestre|date=3 October 2009|title=A política ambiental para a região dos Campos Gerais do Paraná|journal=Raega – O Espaço Geográfico Em Análise|language=pt|volume=18|doi=10.5380/raega.v18i0.13360|issn=2177-2738|doi-access=free}}</ref> It usually appears in regions of smaller altimetric oscillations (for example: Furnas Formation in Itaiacoca or in the elevated portions of Uvaia with the Itararé Formation).<ref name=":10" /> Or also on poorer soils that do not have a long depth and is sandy, as seen near the ''Escarpa Devoniana'' towards the east of the municipality.<ref name=":11" /> There are two main types of photole vegetation: dry fields, formed in relatively flat places, usually in lithosols and poor cambisols. Among them are the Colchão Glass and the Forquilha Glass. It usually exists where there is no grazing, like east of the host district. The other subcategory, the dirty fields, has a few shrubs dominated by ''vassouras'' and ''maria-moles'' (and/or ''assa-peixes''). There is the wet version with species adapted to humidity that arise in [[Depression (geology)|depressions]].<ref name=":10" />

Tapexengui, fumo bravo, red scarlet and pau cigarra are found below the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]. Wildwood was drastically reduced by [[deforestation]] as well as by the use of wood until around the 1950s. Such use was replaced by [[Introduced species|exotic species]] such as ''[[Pinus elliottii]]''. Over time, there was a feedback policy on the amount spent for replanting forests.<ref name=":12" /> Although [[Araucaria angustifolia|araucarias]] often appear in the [[gallery forest]]s in extremely humid areas the tree does not develop, and then emerges [[Dicksonia sellowiana|xaxins]] and [[Phlebodium aureum|samambais]] as found in the [[Serra do Mar]] among other species. In the district of Itaiacoca there is an influence of the [[Atlantic Forest]], reducing the amount of native conifer in opposition to the increase of sapopema and imbuia, more similar to that found in the vicinity of the [[Curitiba|capital of Paraná]].<ref name=":10" />

[[File:Vila Velha Ponta Grossa3.jpg|thumb|[[Sandstone]] of the [[Vila Velha State Park|Vila Velha Park]], mystically known as the "City of Lost Stones", remembering an ancient city of ruins]]

It is famous the sandstone of the [[Vila Velha State Park|Vila Velha Park]], an example of ruiniform relief. In geological terms the forms visualized are recent, originated during the [[gondwana]] megacontinente, where South America was linked to Africa, Oceania, [[Antarctica]] and India. In which the ruins lie in the [[Carboniferous]] period was a more southern latitude covered by glaciers. The landscape itself was formed after several burials and [[Erosion|erosive]] processes. Different shapes can be found: flutes, dissolution cones, pointed tops, towers and pillars. Although the popular saying has long ago explained that Vila Velha was originated by the action of the wind, geological research however has been stating that it is the fruit of rainwater, action of the [[solar energy]], changes in temperature and activity of living beings on the rock (in [[Discontinuity (geotechnical engineering)|discontinuities]] and [[shear zone]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mineropar.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=14|title=Parque Estadual Vila Velha – Diretoria de Geologia (Mineropar) – Instituto de Terras, Cartografia e Geologia do Paraná|website=www.mineropar.pr.gov.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2 September 2018|archive-date=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224013510/http://www.mineropar.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Graben ====
Graben of Ponta Grossa is a [[Graben|tectonic fossa]] with blocks slaughtered of the NE-SW direction (average values: 3&nbsp;km wide and 10&nbsp;km long), where the city is located in the greater part of the urban perimeter. Caused by the displacement of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], so that the whole block can descend. The spaces in vain are occupied by rocks of the fault, allowing that rocks of the Itararé Group and of the Ponta Grossa Formation, therefore of rocks of very different ages are at the same [[Stratigraphic section|stratigraphic level]]. The geological unit of Furnas has a fractured and karstic [[aquifer]] where it has been receiving innumerable grants in the last decades for the installation of [[Artesian aquifer|tubular wells]] due to water quality. The Itararé Group also has [[aquifer]], although the lower quality is used because it is outcrop, since the Furnas normally be lower. The Ponta Grossa Formation has a good form of water storage but difficult to flow and is usually associated with another two in well records. Being in an [[Urban area|urban environment]] is susceptible of contamination. Other cares refer to the [[karst]] [[relief]] in Furnas that can cause [[landslide]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sérgio de Melo|first1=Mário|last2=César Fonseca Giannini|first2=Paulo|date=2007|title=Sandstone dissolution landforms in the Furnas Formation, southern Brazil|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|language=en|volume=32|issue=14|pages=2149–2164|doi=10.1002/esp.1520|issn=0197-9337|bibcode=2007ESPL...32.2149S|s2cid=247673973|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Melo|first1=Mario Sérgio De|last2=Gomes|first2=Ricardo Marins|last3=Pereira|first3=Gabriela Kostrzewycz|date=13 October 2015|journal=Boletim Paranaense de Geociências|language=pt|volume=72|doi=10.5380/geo.v72i0.35937|issn=0067-964X|title=Água Subterrânea No Gráben de Ponta Grossa, Pr|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitangui.uepg.br/eventos/semanadegeografia/_PDFs/20141/oral/GOMES,%20PEREIRA,%20MELO%20resumo.pdf|title=Hydrogeological Characteristics of Ponta Grossa, PR|website=UEPG|publisher=UEPG Geography Week|language=pt-br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitangui.uepg.br/eventos/semanadegeografia/_PDFs/20141/oral/PEREIRA,%20GOMES,%20MELO%20resumo.pdf|title=Quality of Underground Water in the Ponta Grossa (PR) Graben Region|website=UEPG|publisher=UEPG Geography Week|language=pt-br|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref>

==== Arch of the Ponta Grossa ====
This arch, named after the city, is located on a rise of the Earth's crust on the eastern limit of the [[Paraná Basin]]. It arose about 130 million years ago when the South American and African continents were separating.

=== Hydrography ===
The main [[drainage basin]] that covers Ponta Grossa is the [[Tibagi River]] (original [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] denotation "Tibaji"), tributary of the [[Paranapanema River]]<ref name=":10" /> in a hierarchy with the [[Paraná River]].

Pitangui River, one of the most important rivers of the municipality was dammed in 1939 originating the Dam of the Alagados.

Ponta Grossa grew faster in the late 17th century, though [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] had settled a century earlier. Used as a breeding ground for the troops of [[Viamão]] due to natural [[pasture]], in the ''[[freguesia]]'' in 1853 there were 3,033 people (1652 men and 1381 women). In 1877 by order of the Empire, this city as well as other of the [[South Region, Brazil|south of Brazil]] received immigrants such as: [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Germans]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]] and Italians, generating a cultural broth and increasing population. Demographic growth continued at the end of the same century with the railway under construction. Finalized, it allowed greater interconnection between other regions. In 1890 there were 4,774 inhabitants. Being the population concentrated in rail districts in Uvaranas and Oficinas, accompanying of basic services that were coming up successively. Ponta Grossa lives in a historical context of urbanization seen in the south and southeast of the country.<ref name=":14" /> The construction of the railroad was translated in decadence of the ''tropeirismo''. Several people from other municipalities came to work in Ponta Grossa for the maintenance of the lines. It also marks an advance in the level of schooling, with elite members holding an undergraduate degree in other [[States of Brazil|Brazilian states]].<ref name=":16">{{Cite journal|last=Sopelsa|first=Renata|title=De Colonos Desejados a Moradores Indesejados: Um Estudo Sobre a Identidade e Sociabilidade Entre Imigrantes (Ponta Grossa-Pr, Final do Século Xix)|date=2011|journal=História: Questões & Debates|language=en|volume=54|issue=1|issn=2447-8261|doi=10.5380/his.v54i1.25732|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is in 1940 that it becomes the second largest population contingent of Paraná and consequently reference to the interior of the lost state in the following decade.

In 1969 with fiscal incentives in the government of Cyro Martins was installed of new industries, which generated a "bomm" of factories. In the 1980s there was an expansion of the [[Transport network|urban network]], while the railroad is now located in Uvaranas, accompanied by a better infrastructure and then the growth of the [[Transport network|urban network]] and peripheral [[Neighbourhood|neighborhoods]]. In the later decade there were improvements in other sectors. Other districts have predominantly agrarian characteristics, although Guaragi is closer to an urbanized environment.<ref name=":14" /> Ponta Grossa became predominantly urban in the 1970s, in which 52.9% of people lived in [[Urban area|urbanized areas]]. A period that also declines in the rural population that went from 28.2% to 20.2% between the 1980s and 1990s, explained by the [[Mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]], where the labor force migrated to the city (until the 1960s it was only increasing). "''Princess of fields''" reached a rate of urbanization of 97.5% in the start 2000s. Among the controversial aspects is the intense slump that followed in the last decades of the twentieth century, markedly since 1989 due to rapid urbanization and real estate speculation that generated the "lack" of land (20% were idle). In all, there were 58,730 people living in precarious conditions in 2004. Often residing near urban arroyos sand with buildings in places that should be areas of preservation and inefficient policies for transfer or denial of relocation.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Nascimento|first1=Ederson|last2=Matias|first2=Lindon|date=1 August 2006|title=O Processo de Favelização Na Cidade de Ponta Grossa (PR): Notas Sobre a Dinâmica Recente (1989–2004)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308898175}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.fct.unesp.br/nera/publicacoes/singa2005/Trabalhos/Resumos/Lucas%20Bonatelli%20Malho_2_PT_EN.pdf|title=The Irregular Occupation of the Ronda Little Stream Basin, in Ponta Grossa – PR, As Factor of Influence in Its Ambient Characteristids|website=FCT [[UNESP]]|publisher=II International Symposium on Agrarian Geography – Jornada Ariovaldo Umbelino de Oliveira|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref>

According to the archives of the region (now state) of [[São Paulo]] in 1824 there were 75.1% of whites, together with a small share of pardos (4.8%) and free [[Afro-Brazilians]] (0.1%), reaching 80%. Historical data of the [[St. Ann Cathedral, Ponta Grossa|Sant'Ann Parish]] exposes 92.52% whites, with only 6.66% of pardos and 0.82% of [[Afro-Brazilians]]. The number of natives was not evaluated. For the same year, 76.52% of [[Afro-Brazilians]] and 23.48% of pardos were among slaves. But due to the purchase and sale it is possible to change the values. It is from 1832 that in the maps the natives begin to appear, oscillating to less than 1%.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ponta Grossa: um século de vida|last=Alves Pinto|first=Elisabete|publisher=Kugler Artes Gráficas|year=1983|location=Ponta Grossa|pages=76 and 77}}</ref> Due to the history of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] and [[slavery]] not so present as in other regions, even in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], the population is predominantly white.

At the same time the number of whites is lower in these cities, but in relation to "Princess of the Fields" is proportional to their fourth place by total number of people. The [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous population]] is larger than [[Maringá]], which has a larger population, and Ponta Grossa is behind only the two largest cities in the state.

=== Internal Migration ===

The migration by internal population contingents follows a geographical logic of proximity and flows. The population also underwent changes due to the limit of the municipality that normally went until the [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] border to the south, since the registries was by the area covered by the parish. It is noticed that between 1823 and 1879 of the residents of Ponta Grossa who live in the same country or had origin in some city of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] (305 people or 8.9%) or of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], in a greater number: 462 people (13.5%) Among the [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] cities that contributed most to the population increase were [[Castro, Paraná|Castro]] (for historical and economic reasons), followed by [[Campo Largo, Paraná|Campo Largo]], [[Palmeira, Paraná|Palmeira]], [[Lapa, Paraná|Lapa]], [[São José dos Pinhais]], [[Curitiba]], [[Itapetininga]], [[Itapeva, São Paulo|Itapeva]] and [[Sorocaba]]. But it was not just the two states that made up the population of the city. [[Rio Grande do Sul]] had its participation in consequence of the ''tropeirismo'', mainly with the cities of the north of the state: [[Passo Fundo]], [[Vacaria]] and [[Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul|Cruz Alta]]. Other cities that have emerged along the Way of Viamão as well as Ponta Grossa also appear in the origin of the resident princesinos like [[Lages]] in Santa Catarina (6 men and 4 women).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ponta Grossa: um século de vida|last=Alves Pinto|first=Elisabete|publisher=Kugler Artes Gráficas|year=1983|location=Ponta Grossa|pages=89 and 90}}</ref> In recent history Ponta Grossa has received interstate migrants between 1990 and 2010, as a consequence of the dynamics of flows to the [[Mesoregion (geography)|mesoregion]] centers, as has also been occurring in other attractive urban areas of the state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rodrigues da Costa|first1=Fábio |last2=Rocha|first2=Márcio Mendes|date=15 February 2013|title=A Mobilidade da Populaçao Paranaense a Partir da Reestruturação Produtiva (1970 a 2010)|url=http://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/geografia/article/view/9139|journal=Geografia (Londrina)|language=pt|volume=21|issue=1|pages=125–139|doi=10.5433/2447-1747.2012v21n1p125|issn=2447-1747|doi-broken-date=1 November 2024}}</ref>

=== Immigration ===
[[Russians]], [[Germans]], [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Austrians]] form the largest group of immigrants of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. By the civil registry in the Sant'Ana Registry, one of the principal of the city, the largest registry of grooms between 1889 and 1920 are from the previous three, which proves the affirmative. They are 257 Poles, 102 Germans and 64 Austrians, with booms in different decades according to the biggest waves of immigrants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ponta Grossa: um século de vida|last=Alves Pinto|first=Elisabete|publisher=Kugler Artes Gráficas|year=1983|location=Ponta Grossa|pages=92|language=pt}}</ref> Since 1870, [[Empire of Brazil|Empire]] politicians have encouraged [[European immigration to Brazil|European immigration]] to the country, considering their advanced agricultural techniques and seeking to fill areas.

Ponta Grossa, as well as the southern half of Brazil, live a [[demographic transition]] period, where the largest population is no longer in the children's zone, but has not yet reached the highest peaks in adulthood, a trend of the future. The number of elderly people has been increasing, although in larger proportion in the Female sex. The population over 65 years of age reaches 21416 (2010, 6.87% of [[Ageing|aging index]]). Currently, considering the 2010 census, the largest age group is between 15 and 24 years old, therefore a predominance among adolescents and young people, giving the [[population pyramid]] a "beahive" shape rather than the previous pyramid shape of the previous two decades. There are other phases of higher growth in relation to age bands before or after them, such as 5–9 years (before) and 10–14 years (after). However, the number of inhabitants 80 and older is not so different as the number of 1-year-olds (4109 vs 4376). Over 30 years old there is predominance of female gender, an opposite situation in the infantile-juvenile phase, where the [[Human male sexuality|male sex]] loses only at the age of 7 years. In a total balance, women predominate (51.43%) with 160249 residents of the sex, a proportion similar to 1991. Men corresponded to a figure of 9,000 below the total number of women, altogether 151362 (48.57%). In the last decade the ratio of adolescents' dependence on the financial issue has reduced to less than half, in 1991 it was 60%.<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipardes.gov.br/cadernos/MontaCadPdf1.php?Municipio=84000|title=Caderno Estatístico – Município de Ponta Grossa|website=IPARDES|access-date=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/pt/perfil_m/ponta-grossa_pr#demografia|title=Ponta Grossa, PR – Demografia|website=Atlas de Desenvolvimento Humano do Brasil}}</ref>

Until 1987 it was called the Botuquara Industrial District, but from that year on it became the Industrial District Mayor Cyro Martins. In 1992 the [[planned community]] determined that much of the right bank of the BR-376 towards Curitiba was destined as Industrial Zone.

==== Commerce and services ====
It is the sector that occupies the most labor, due to its own characteristics. This segment occupies more than half of Campos Gerais' [[Value-added tax|VAT]] (largely due to trade and vehicle repair), only with the value of Ponta Grossa, without considering other sectors.<ref name=":24" /> IPARDES data for 2000 showed the low dynamics surrounding commercial and service activity in the city so it's shown in the [[value added]], lower compared to other medium-sized cities in the interior of the state. But it is balanced by the stronger [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] even in relation to larger cities. In 1998 there were only four companies destined to trade among the largest locally, which contributes to the low value that is taxed.<ref name=":25" /> Despite this, trade and repair services together represent 55.83% of the business structure in the municipality in 2004.

==== Vila Velha State Park ====
[[File:Furnas Brasil Parana Ponta Grossa Vila Velha 2010 04 2500.jpg|thumb|Furna that has the panoramic elevator, known as "Furna 1".]]
The [[Vila Velha State Park]] was created on 12 October 1953, being listed as Historical and Artistic Heritage of Paraná on 18 January 1966, remaining closed between 2002 and 2004 for revitalization. Access is via BR-376 and is about 28&nbsp;km from Ponta Grossa and 84&nbsp;km from the [[Curitiba|capital of Paraná]]. The park is a conservation unit under Brazilian law and is administered by the Environmental Institute of Paraná. Much of the route, visitation takes place through [[trail]]s. What most calls the attention of tourists is the features (which often resemble objects) of the exposed [[sandstone]]s that originate from [[erosion]] and [[weathering]], giving off particles during the melting of the rocks. These that formed on the sand deposit in the [[Carboniferous]], 360 million years ago ([[Ice age]]). There is no consensus on which is the main agent, although it certainly involves the action of water. In its area it also has the furnas that are "depressions that resemble craters", there are six furnas in the place, but only two are open to visitation, in one of them there was a panoramic elevator, currently disabled. Also located in the park is Lagoa Dourada, which is also a [[valley]] hat was silted up using the material from the Guabiroba River that it has been receiving for being in its [[floodplain]], similar to what occurs in Lagoa Tarumã. The name is due to the reflection of sunlight on the mineral [[mica]] present in the place.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Menezes|first=Simone|date=June 2008|title=Vila Velha State Park|url=http://festivaldascataratas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/33.-PARQUE-ESTADUAL-DE-VILHA-VELHA.pdf|journal=Fórum Internacional do Turismo do Iguassu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Boratto|first1=Janaínn Valeska|last2=Moreira|first2=Jasmine Cardozo|last3=Stachowiak|first3=Paulo Roberto Batista|date=July 2011|title=Vila Velha State Park: An Analysis Based on Community Input|url=http://www.bibliotecadigital.gpme.org.br/bd/wp-content/uploads/more/pdf/bd-gpme-1268.pdf|journal=Anais do 31º Congresso Brasileiro de Espeleologia|publisher=GMPE Biblioteca}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Análise da Opinião da Comunidade Pontagrossense Sobre o Parque Estadual de Vila Veelha (PR)|url=https://www2.uepg.br//turismo/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/08/JO%c3%83O-PEDRO-MACIEL.pdf|last=Maciel|first=João Pedro|date=13 November 2018|publisher=[[State University of Ponta Grossa]]|access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref>

==== Buraco do Padre ====
[[Buraco do Padre]] is a furna, just like the ones found in the [[Vila Velha State Park]], that is, formed by underground [[erosion]] where the dissolution of [[sandstone]] minerals and the direction of faults and fractures contribute to forming the feature. It is situated on a private property owned by Álvaro Scheffer, 24&nbsp;km from the center of Ponta Grossa and relatively close to the protected area of [[Vila Velha State Park|Vila Velha]]. Access is via the PR-513 connecting Itaiacoca, with part of the road not paved. The name has an uncertain origin, but it must have appeared in the second half of the twentieth century, for being on a high and secluded plateau, religious used it for retreats and thus the most intimate and individual contact with the [[Divinity|divine]]. The attraction is inserted in the Campos Gerais National Park, allowing public use such as contemplation, walking the trails and bathing, just like in the Integral Protection Area of the Devonian Escarpment. Inside there is a 25 m high waterfall, through the flow of the Quebra-Pedra River that follows the NE-SW direction controlled by the Arch of the Ponta Grossa. At 50 m upstream there is another smaller furna.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Parque Estadual de Vila Velha e Buraco do Padre em Ponta Grossa/PR|url=http://www.anppas.org.br/encontro5/cd/artigos/GT1-770-972-20100903182541.pdf|date=30 April 2020|website=archive.vn|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200430194852/http://www.anppas.org.br/encontro5/cd/artigos/GT1-770-972-20100903182541.pdf|archive-date=30 April 2020|access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref><ref>Melo,M.S.; Lopes,M.C.; Boska,M.A. 2005.
