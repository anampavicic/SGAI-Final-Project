The city had a population of 179,147 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |date=11 March 2022 |title=सातारा हद्दवाढ भागात नवे 8 प्रभाग : प्रारुप रचना जाहीर |url=https://pudhari.news/maharashtra/satara/136685/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A2-%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87-8-2/ar}}</ref>

==History==
The first known Muslim rule of the [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan]] took place in 1296. In 1636, the [[Nizam Shahi]] dynasty came to an end. In 1663, [[Shivaji]] conquered Parali and Satara fort. After the death of [[Sambhaji|'''Chhatrapati''' Sambhaji]](Son of [[Shivaji]]) [[Shahu I|Shahu]], heir apparent to the [[Maratha Kingdom]], was captured by Mughals when he was only seven years old. He remained their prisoner until the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707. 

The Dowager Maharani [[Tarabai]] proclaimed his younger half-brother, and her son, Shahu Sambhaji as Chhatrapati Maharaj under her regency. Mughals released Shahu under certain preconditions in 1707, so that Marathas would face an internal war for the throne. Shahu returned to the [[Maratha Kingdom]] and claimed his inheritance. 

[[Aurangzeb]]'s son Muhammad Azam Shah conquered Satara fort [[Ajinkyatara]] after a 6-month siege, later won by Parshuram Pratinidhi in 1706. In 1708, [[Chattrapati Shahu]], the son of Chattrapati [[Sambhaji]], was crowned at the Satara fort. The direct descendants of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj|Shivaji]] continue to live in Satara. Chattrapati [[Udayanraje Bhonsle]] is the 13th descendant of [[Shivaji]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Satara District : Historical reference|url=https://www.satara.gov.in/en/history/|website=www.satara.gov.in}}</ref>

Satara was the first state to be annexed by British Governor-General Dalhousie’s policy of ‘Doctrine of Lapese’ in 1848.
