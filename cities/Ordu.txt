'''Ordu''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈoɾdu}}) or '''Altınordu''' is a port city on the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Turkey]], historically also known as '''Cotyora''' or '''Kotyora''' ({{lang-pnt|Κοτύωρα}}), and the capital of [[Ordu Province]]. The city forms the urban part of the [[Altınordu, Ordu|Altınordu]] district, with a population of 235,096 in 2023.<ref name=citypop/>

==Name==
Kotyora, the original name of the city is a legacy of indigenous [[Colchis|Colchians]]. The name is allegedly composed of an old [[Laz language]] word for pottery ('Koto', similar to [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] 'Koto', [[Georgian language|Georgian]] 'Kotani' and Laz 'Katana') and a common [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] suffix indicating belonging ('Uri'). In [[Zan languages|Zan]] (aka Colchian) Kotyora means a place where pottery is made.<ref>Özhan Öztürk. Pontus, Antikçağ'dan Günümüze Karadeniz'in Etnik ve Siyasi Tarihi, Genesis Yayınları. Ankara 2011, S.492</ref> This point is supported with several other Kartvelian place names existing in the region as well as the region itself historically being known as [[Beyliks of Djanik|Djanik]] (Djani being another name for Laz).<ref>Özhan Öztürk. Pontus, Antikçağ'dan Günümüze Karadeniz'in Etnik ve Siyasi Tarihi. Genesis Yayınları. Ankara 2011. S.566</ref>

The contemporary name of Ordu meaning 'army camp' in [[Ottoman Turkish]] was adopted during the Ottoman Empire because of an army outpost being located near the present day city.

==History==
[[File:Ordu-osmanli-kotyora.jpg|thumb|The city during the Ottoman era]]
[[File:OrduSeaside.jpg|thumb|Ordu coast and ''Boztepe'' hill]]
In the 8th century BC, Cotyora (Κοτύωρα) was founded by the [[Miletus|Miletians]] as one of a string of [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] along the [[Black Sea]] coast. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that it was a colony of the [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinopians]].<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:14.31 Diodorus Siculus, Library, § 14.31.1]</ref>
[[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' relates that the [[Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries)|Ten Thousand]] rested there for 45 days before embarking for home.<ref name="pw">
Olshausen, Eckart, "Cotyora" in ''Brill's New Pauly, Antiquity'' {{doi|10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e621460}}</ref><ref>''Anabasis'' V.5.3f</ref><ref name="eb11">''[[Encyclopedia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', ''s.v.'' Ordu</ref> [[Strabo]] also mentions it.<ref>XII.3.17</ref> Under [[Pharnaces I of Pontus]], Cotyora was united in a ''[[synoikismos]]'' with [[Giresun|Cerasus]].<ref name="pw"/>
[[Arrian]], in the ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' (131 CE), describes it as a village "and not a large one."<ref>16.3 Translated in ''Arrian: Periplus Ponti Euxini'', edited and translated by Aidan Liddle (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2003), p. 75</ref> [[Suda]] mentioned that it was also called Cytora (Κύτωρα).<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/240#al.3917 Suda, ka.2170]</ref>

The area came under the control of the [[Danishmends]], then the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1214 and 1228, and the Hacıemiroğulları Beylik in 1346. Afterwards, it passed to the dominion of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1461 along with the [[Empire of Trabzon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/ordu-tarihi.htm |title=Ordu ili tarihi |website=www.karalahana.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513134407/http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/ordu-tarihi.htm |archive-date=13 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The modern city was founded by the Ottomans as '''Bayramlı''' near Eskipazar as a military outpost {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Ordu.

In 1869, the city's name was changed to Ordu and it was united with the districts of [[Bolaman]], [[Perşembe]], [[Ulubey, Ordu|Ulubey]], Hansamana ([[Gölköy]]), and [[Aybastı]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the city was more than half Christian (Greek and Armenian), and was known for its Greek schools.<ref name="eb11"/>

On 4 April 1921, Ordu province was created by separating from [[Trebizond Vilayet]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/ordu.htm |title=Karadeniz Ansiklopedisi: Ordu maddesi |website=www.karalahana.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507120833/http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/ordu.htm |archive-date=7 May 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2018, at the same site, they also discovered sculptures of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]].<ref>[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/photo-dionysus-pan-sculptures-found-at-site-of-2-100-year-old-goddess-kybele-in-northern-turkey-135243#photo-1 Dionysus, Pan sculptures found at site of 2,100-year-old goddess Kybele in northern Turkey]</ref> In 2021, archaeologists complained because a stone quarry used dynamite destroying some of the rock tombs.<ref>[https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ancient-castle-under-threat-of-quarry-164121 Ancient castle under threat of quarry]</ref>

== Ordu today ==
[[File:Orducitycenter3.jpg|thumb|right|Old houses in Taşbaşı/Altınordu.]]
The ''Sağra'' factory shop, selling many varieties of chocolate-covered hazelnuts, is one of the town's attractions.

The [[Ordu Boztepe Gondola|Boztepe aerial tramway]] is another popular attraction which is set to become a modern symbol for the city.

Local music is typical of the Black Sea region, including the [[Kemençe of the Black Sea|kemençe]]. The cuisine is primarily based on local vegetables and includes both typical Turkish dishes — such as [[Flatbread|pide]] and [[kebab]] — and more interesting fare such as plain or caramel 'burnt ice-cream'.

==Economy==
Ordu is one of the provinces where hazelnuts are grown the most in Turkey.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gazete|first=Banka|date=21 November 2021|title=Döviz düşerken fındık fiyatı da düştü|page=https://gazetebanka.com/|work=Gazetebanka.com|url=https://gazetebanka.com/doviz-duserken-findik-fiyati-da-dustu/11369/|access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref> Ordu is famous for hazelnuts, producing about 25 percent of the worldwide crop.
