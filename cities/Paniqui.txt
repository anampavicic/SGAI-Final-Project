'''Paniqui''' ({{IPA|tl|pɐnɪˈki|}}), officially the '''Municipality of Paniqui''' ({{langx|ilo|Ili ti Paniqui}}; {{langx|pag|Baley na Paniqui}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Paniqui}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Tarlac]], [[Philippines]]. According to the [[2020_Philippine_census|2020 census]], it has a population of 103,003 people.{{PH census|current}} It is the birthplace of the 11th [[President of the Philippines]], [[Corazon Aquino]].

==Etymology==
Paniqui is a [[Hispanicization|Hispanized]] term derived from the Ilocano word "''pampaniki''" which means "[[bat]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paniqui.gov.ph/about-paniqui/history-of-paniqui.html|title=History of Paniqui|publisher=Municipal government of Paniqui|access-date=15 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151926/http://www.paniqui.gov.ph/about-paniqui/history-of-paniqui.html|archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref> since the town has caves that house bats.

==History==
{{Onesource|section|date=November 2022}}
The birth of Paniqui could be traced way back in 1712 when the provincial government of [[Pangasinan]] sent a group of men south of [[Bayambang]], [[Pangasinan]] for the expansion of the Christian faith. The pioneering group was led by two brothers, Raymundo and Manuel Paragas of [[Dagupan]] and established the Local Government in a Sitio called "manggang marikit" (mango of an unmarried woman). Surprisingly, in this sitio, there is a great number of mammals called by Ilocanos "pampaniki" and it was from this term that the name Paniqui was derived.

An uprising led by Caragay during the early part of 1720 forced the Local Government in "manggang marikit" to abandon the place and to evacuate for lowland called "Acocolao", a place {{convert|2|km|sp=us}} west of the present Poblacion. It was a historical sitio where the first Filipino Moro, Sultan Ali Mudin, was [[baptism|baptized]] in 1750.

Paniqui was a sprawling town that covered a wide area that time. Some of the barrios that formerly comprised Paniqui were "San Roque", now [[Cuyapo]]; "Barong", now [[Gerona, Tarlac|Gerona]]; "San Jose De Camiling", now [[Camiling]]; "Bani", now [[Ramos, Tarlac|Ramos]]; "San Ramon", now [[Moncada, Tarlac|Moncada]]; and [[Anao, Tarlac|Anao]].

The period between 1750 and 1896 were painful years of Spanish tyranny and oppression because the insurrectos and sometimes bandits, who are conveniently sprouted among the people, made sporadic attacks upon the [[conquistadores]]. These attacks on the Spaniards, who came on the islands bringing the sword and the cross, were marred by cholera and smallpox epidemics punctuated by floods and typhoons.

However, a group of Paniqui [[Patriotism|patriots]], welded together by a common belief of oneness, unselfish devotion for freedom and who were spurred by ruthless Spanish tyranny, organized a legitimate segment of the [[Katipunan]] on January 12, 1896, which is a far cry from the bandits that used to harass the Spaniards.

These dauntless men made daring exploits, unrecorded in the history of the [[Katipunan]], the most prominent of which was the ambuscade of Spanish soldiers along the road going to Anao and killing a great number of them. These incidents made a prelude to the end of the Spanish occupation in Paniqui.

The advent of American occupation saw a happy transition from the almost aristocratic and enigmatic characteristic of Spanish conquistadores to the [[Democracy|democratic way of life]] under American tutelage.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151926/http://www.paniqui.gov.ph/about-paniqui/history-of-paniqui.html Paniqui: History], Paniqui.gov.ph. Accessed November 21, 2022.</ref>
