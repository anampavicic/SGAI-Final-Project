It has a population of 172,000 (2017).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/pob_xls/pobmun.zip|title=Cifras Oficiales de Población de los Municipios Españoles: Revisión del Padrón Municipal – Población a 1 de enero de 2017.|publisher=[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística]]}}</ref> It is a [[port city]] located in the northern coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], facing the [[Cantabrian Sea]].
 
It is believed to have been a port since ancient times, due to its favourable location, and is documented as far back as the 11th century. Much of the medieval city was lost in the [[1941 Santander fire|Great Fire of 1941]]. Today, its remaining old town, beach and other attractions are popular with tourists and other visitors and its economy is mainly service based. The port is still very active and a regular ferry service operates to the [[United Kingdom]]. Fish and seafood dominate the local cuisine. Santander notably houses the headquarters of multinational bank [[Banco Santander]], which was founded there. The city has a [[Santander, Spain#Climate|mild climate]] typical of the Spanish northern coastline with frequent rainfall and stable temperatures. Cold snaps and heat waves are very rare.

==History==
{{main|Timeline of Santander, Spain}}

===Origins, Roman period and Middle Ages===
The origin of the earliest human settlements in the current Santander is not easy to establish because there is little written and little archaeological data. However, there would appear to be good practical reasons for ancient settlers to have chosen the north side of the bay, sheltered from it and safer from the storms of the [[Bay of Biscay]], on the north side of the promontory of [[Somorrostro]] and along the ancient [[Becedo]] estuary. Moreover, the hillside provided good visibility for spotting potential attackers, making this the ideal place for the foundation of a stable settlement, which was to evolve throughout the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fernández González|first1=Lorena|title=Santander una ciudad Medieval|date=2002|publisher=Estvdio|isbn=9788495742056}}</ref>

Although it is mentioned for the first time in 1068, in a draft document made by [[Sancho II of León and Castile|King Sancho II]], in the 9th century [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II the Chaste]] founded the ''Abadía de los Cuerpos Santos'' ("Abbey of the Holy Bodies") in the existing chapel on the hill of Somorrostro, housing as holy relics the heads of [[Saint Emeterius]] and [[Saint Celedonius]] and the graves of other unknown martyrs, giving the abbey its name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13458d.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Santander |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 February 1912 |access-date=14 April 2011}}</ref>

[[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] granted the city a ''[[fuero]]'' (charter) in 1187.{{Sfn|Casado Soto|1985|p=646}}
[[File:Santcivitatis.jpg|thumb|left|Santander, c. 1590&nbsp;– by [[Joris Hoefnagel]]]]
During the 12th and 13th centuries the population was contained within the walls of two different pueblas. La Puebla, the older, on the hill overlooking the city facing the bay, included the old castle, the Abbey of the Holy Bodies and the cloister. It had three rows of houses, separated by Rua Carnicerias and Rua Mayor, where the homes of prominent people of the town were, as well as those of the Abbot's canons. Meanwhile, the Puebla Nueva contained the convent of Santa Clara and San Francisco, which gave its name to one of the main streets; other important streets were the Rua de la Sal, The cavalcade Palace, Ribera, Don Gutierre, Puerta de la Sierra, Gallows and the Arcillero Rua. The two pueblas were joined by a bridge over the river that divided Becedo and flowed down to the shipyards, which were ordered by the king to take timber from the Cantabrian forests for shipbuilding. The villa was required to give the monarchy a ship per year.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By the end of the 15th century Santander had a population of about 4,000 or 5,000 inhabitants.{{Sfn|Casado Soto|1985|p=648}}

The city owes its existence to the excellent harbour of the [[Bay of Santander]]. Santander was an important port for [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in the later Middle Ages, and also for trade with the [[New World]]. It officially became a city in 1755.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ringrose|first=David R.|title=Toward a contemporary city: Santander, 1755–1910|year=2005|page=7 |publisher=Ed.

{{main|SS Cabo Machichaco}}
On 3 November 1893 a steamship, {{SS|Cabo Machichaco||2}}, caught fire while she was being unloaded at a pier in the heart of the city. A crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people watched as crew and firefighters fought the fire. About 40 tonnes of dynamite being carried in her forward holds exploded, killing about 590 people, injuring about 2,000, sinking the ship and destroying at least 65 buildings near the harbour.<ref name=Jar_Torre>{{cite magazine |last=Jar Torre |first=Luis |date=November 2009 |title=Un Desastre a la Española |magazine=Revista General de Marina |lang=es |url= https://www.grijalvo.com/Jar/Cabo_Machichaco.htm |via=páginas personales de Juan Manuel Grijalvo |access-date=14 September 2022}}</ref>

On 21 March 1894 a [[Salvage diving|salvage diver]] working to salvage cargo from ''Cabo Machichaco''{{'}}s wreck accidentally detonated about 11 tonnes of dynamite that were submerged in the after hold of the ship. 18 people were killed and 11 injured.<ref name=Jar_Torre/>

It led to a major change in the architecture of Santander, away from the older small stone and wood buildings with balconies to the enormous blocks of flats built during the reconstruction. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

There was only one casualty of the fire, a firefighter from Madrid killed in the line of duty, but thousands of families were left homeless and the city was plunged into chaos. The fire destroyed the greater part of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town centre and gutted the city's [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[cathedral]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Balance de la tragedia| newspaper = El Diario Montañés| date = 13 February 2011| url = http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/20110211/local/cantabria-general/balance-tragedia-201102130023.html| language = es |access-date = 14 December 2014 }}</ref>

==Climate==
The city of Santander has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), the annual thermal oscillation of the average monthly temperatures reaching around 10&nbsp;°C (18&nbsp;°F).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Due to the relatively mild winters (with average temperatures staying near 10&nbsp;°C (18&nbsp;°F)), it is technically classified as maritime subtropical (Cfbl/Cfbk) by the Trewartha climate classification. 

The maximum temperature reached in Santander Airport was {{convert|37.8|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 27 June 2009, and the minimum temperature {{convert|-5.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 21 January 1957.

Sunshine hours are very low by comparison with the rest of mainland and southern Spain. Even compared with other areas of northern Spain, such as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which have many more hours of sunshine in coastal cities such as [[Vigo]] or [[Pontevedra]]. With annual averages of approximately 1650 hours of sunshine, Santander's southern areas are about as sunny as [[London]] and [[Paris]], and quite a bit less sunny than most of England's south coastal regions. The area closer to the coast has higher sunshine time but lower summer afternoon temperatures.
