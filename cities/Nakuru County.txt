==Sites of interest==
Nakuru County is home to [[Lake Nakuru]], [[Lake Elmenteita]] and [[Lake Naivasha]], which are some of the Rift Valley soda lakes. Lake Nakuru is best known for its thousands, sometimes millions of flamingoes nesting along the shores. The surface of the shallow lake is often hardly recognizable due to the continually shifting mass of pink. The number of flamingos on the lake varies with water and food conditions and the best vantage point is from Baboon Cliff. Also of interest, an area of 188&nbsp;km around the lake fenced off as a sanctuary to protect Rothschild giraffe and black rhinos.

Other sites of interest around Nakuru include [[Menengai]] Crater, an extinct volcano 2,490&nbsp;m (8,167&nbsp;ft) high, and the [[Nakuru National Park]] which is a wildlife zone. The views of the crater itself, as well as the surrounding countryside, are spectacular.

[[Hyrax Hill]] Prehistoric Site, discovered by the Leakeys in 1926, is considered a major [[Neolithic]] and [[Iron Age]] site. The adjoining museum features are from various nearby excavations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hyrax Hill Museum – National Museums of Kenya |url=https://museums.or.ke/hyrax-hill-museum/ |access-date=2023-06-07 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The second-largest surviving volcanic crater in the world, the [[Menengai Crater]] is 2500 meters above sea level at its highest point. The crater plunges 500 m down from the rim and the summit is accessible by foot or vehicle 8&nbsp;km from the main road.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-09-02 |title=Menengai Crater {{!}} Kenya Safari Tour Destinations {{!}} Explore Kenya |url=https://www.lakenakurukenya.com/menengai-crater/ |access-date=2022-10-24 |website=Lake Nakuru National Park |language=en-US}}</ref> The mountain is also surrounded by a nature reserve.

The [http://www.rvist.ac.ke/ Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology] is a tourist attraction. It is a giant institute established in 1979 by the leaders and people of Rift Valley.

==Urban areas ==
Surrounding towns include Lanet, which lies approximately 10&nbsp;km from Nakuru. Lanet is predominantly a residential town and is home to an army base. [[Njoro]] is another urban town that lies 20&nbsp;km in the outskirts of Nakuru, and is a small agricultural town with a local university aimed at promoting agricultural development in [[Kenya]], namely [[Egerton University]] (est. 1934). [[Naivasha]] is another major significant urban Centre in Nakuru County, which sits at the floor of the Great Rift Valley and serves as a major transit of goods. Travelers passing through Naivasha usually make stopovers along the Naivasha – Nakuru Highway to enjoy the beautiful and scenic escarpments of the Great Rift Valley.
