Formerly a [[Provinces of China|province]], Ningxia was incorporated into [[Gansu]] in 1954 but was later separated from Gansu in 1958 and reconstituted as an autonomous region for the [[Hui people]], one of the 56 officially recognised [[List of ethnic groups in China|nationalities of China]]. Twenty percent of China's Hui population lives in Ningxia.<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 October 2016 |title=By Choosing Assimilation, China's Hui Have Become One of the World's Most Successful Muslim Minorities |language=en |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21708274-choosing-assimilation-chinas-hui-have-become-one-worlds-most-successful-muslim |access-date=8 October 2016}}</ref>

Ningxia is bounded by [[Shaanxi]] to the east, [[Gansu]] to the south and west and [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]] to the north and has an area of around {{convert|66400|km2}}.<ref name=area/> This sparsely settled, mostly desert region lies partially on the [[Loess Plateau]] and in the vast plain of the [[Yellow River]] and features the [[Great Wall of China]] along its northeastern boundary.

Ningxia was the core area of the [[Western Xia]] in the 11th–13th centuries, established by the Tangut people; its name, "Peaceful Xia", derived from the [[Mongol conquest of Western Xia|Mongol conquest of the state]].<ref name="britannica" /> The Tanguts made significant achievements in literature, art, music, and architecture, particularly invented [[Tangut script]]. Long one of the country's poorest areas, a small winemaking industry has become economically important since the 1980s. Before the arrival of [[viticulture]], Ningxia's 6.8 million people, 36 per cent of whom are Muslims from the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic group, relied largely on [[Grazing|animal grazing]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and the cultivation of [[Goji|wolfberries]] used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Since then, winemaking has become the premier specialty of Ningxia, and the province devotes almost 40,000 hectares to vineyards and producing 120 million bottles of wine in 2017 – a quarter of the entire nation's production.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tobin |first=Meaghan |date=12 May 2019 |title=Can China Become the Wine World's Next California? |language=en |work=South China Morning Post |url=https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3009784/can-china-become-wine-worlds-next-california}}</ref>

==History==
The earliest human activity in Ningxia can be traced back to 30,000 years ago, with remains of the [[Shuidonggou|Shuidonggou Culture]] found in [[Lingwu]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=历史的眷顾：古城宁夏六宗“最”_宁夏民风民俗_新疆旅行网 |url=https://www.xjlxw.com/xb/nx/mfms/8086.html |access-date=2024-09-01 |website=www.xjlxw.com}}</ref>[[Image:108 Dagobas.JPG|thumb|left|The [[One Hundred and Eight Stupas|108 stupas]] near [[Qingtongxia]].]]
As a frontier zone between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers, Ningxia was a frequent seat of war and incursions by non-Chinese tribes. Ningxia and its surrounding areas were incorporated into the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] as the [[Beidi Commandery]] as early as the 3rd century BC. To pacify the region, the imperial government established military colonies to reclaim land. In addition, horse pasturages were founded under the Imperial Stud to safeguard the supply of army horses, as early as the Western [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 9).<ref name="Ho 2000" /> Throughout the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Tang dynasty]] there were several large cities established in the region. The [[Liang Province rebellion]] at the [[end of the Han Dynasty]] affected Ningxia.

By the 11th century the [[Tangut people]] had established the [[Western Xia dynasty]] on the outskirts of the then-[[Song dynasty]]. Jews also lived in Ningxia, as evidenced by the fact that in 1489, after a major flood destroyed [[Torah scroll]]s in [[Kaifeng]], a replacement set was sent to the [[Kaifeng Jews]] by the [[Ningbo]] and Ningxia [[Jews in China|Jewish communities]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Xu |first=Xin |title=The Jews of Kaifeng: China History, Culture, and Religion |date=2003 |publisher=Ktav Publishing House |location=Jersey City, NJ |language=en}}</ref>

It then came under [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] domination after [[Genghis Khan]] conquered [[Yinchuan]] in the early 13th century. Muslims from Central Asia also began moving into Ningxia from the west. By the late 17th century, Ningxia had become a weaving centre, producing many early Chinese carpets.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Eiland |first=Murray L. |date=2003 |title=Carpets of the Ming Dynasty? |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/29757577 |journal=East and West |volume=53 |issue=1/4 |pages=179–208 |jstor=29757577 |issn=0012-8376}}</ref> The Muslim [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]] of the 19th century affected Ningxia.

In 1914, Ningxia was merged with the [[Provinces of China|province]] of [[Gansu]]. In 1928, it became a separate province. Between 1914 and 1928, the [[Ma clique]] ruled the provinces of [[Qinghai]], Ningxia and Gansu; General [[Ma Hongkui]] was the military governor of Ningxia and had absolute authority in the province. The [[Muslim conflict in Gansu (1927–30)|Muslim conflict in Gansu]], which lasted from 1927 to 1930, spilt over into Ningxia. In 1934, warlord and [[National Revolutionary Army]] general [[Sun Dianying]] [[War in Ningxia (1934)|attempted to conquer]] the province, but was defeated by an alliance led by the [[Ma clique]].{{sfnp|Lin|2011|pp=37–39}}

From 1950 to 1958, a [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950–1958)|Kuomintang Islamic insurgency]] resulted in fighting throughout Northwest China, including Ningxia. In 1954, the [[Chinese government]] merged Ningxia with Gansu, but in 1958 Ningxia formally became an [[autonomous region of China]]. In 1969, Ningxia received a part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, but this area was returned in 1979.

A number of Chinese artifacts dating from the [[Tang dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]], some of which had been owned by [[Emperor Zhenzong]], were excavated and then came into the hands of Ma Hongkui, who refused to publicize the findings. Among the artifacts were a white marble tablet from the Tang dynasty, gold nails, and bands made out of metal. It was not until after Ma Hongkui died that his wife went to Taiwan in 1971 from America to bring the artifacts to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who turned them over to the [[Taipei]] [[National Palace Museum]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UzrAAAAMAAJ&q=in+1971,+his+widow+took+them+from+America+to+Chiang+Kai-shek+in+Taiwan.+They+were+later+acquired+by+the+National+Palace |title=China Archaeology and Art Digest, Volume 3, Issue 4 |publisher=Art Text (HK) |year=2000 |page=354 |access-date=28 November 2010}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Helanshan.jpg|thumb|left|From a cable car running to the top of [[Helan Mountains]].]]
Present-day Ningxia is one of the nation's smallest provincial-level units and borders the provinces of [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]] and the [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]]. At 3556 meters above sea level, Aobaogeda ({{lang|zh-hans|敖包疙瘩}}) in the [[Helan Mountains]] is the highest point in Ningxia.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2 September 2014 |title=Dēng áobāo gēda shǎng juédǐng měijǐng |script-title=zh:登敖包疙瘩 赏绝顶美景 |language=zh |work=Fènghuáng zīxùn |url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20140902/41825100_0.shtml |access-date=6 November 2018}}</ref>

Ningxia is a relatively dry, desert-like region and features a diverse geography of forested mountains and hills, table lands, deserts, flood plains and basins cut through by the [[Yellow River]]. The Ningxia ecosystem is one of the least studied regions in the world. Significant [[irrigation]] supports the growing of [[wolfberry|wolfberries]], a commonly consumed [[fruit]] throughout the region. Ningxia's deserts include the [[Tengger desert]] in [[Shapotou]].

The northern section, through which the Yellow River flows, supports the best agricultural land. A railroad, linking [[Lanzhou]] with [[Baotou]], crosses the region. A highway has been built across the Yellow River at Yinchuan.

On 16 December 1920, the [[1920 Haiyuan earthquake|Haiyuan earthquake]], 8.6 magnitude, at {{coord|36.6|105.32}}, initiated a series of landslides that killed an estimated 200,000 people. Over 600 large [[loess]] landslides created more than 40 new lakes.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Close |first1=U. |last2=McCormick |date=1922 |title=Where the Mountains Walked |magazine=National Geographic Magazine |language=en |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=445–464}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Feng |first1=X. |title=Proceedings, IVth International Conference and Field Workshop on Landslides |last2=Guo |first2=A. |date=1985 |publisher=Japan Landslide Society |location=Tokyo |pages=339–346 |language=en |chapter=Earthquake Landslides in China}}.

===Mineral resources===
Ningxia is rich in mineral resources with proven deposits of 34 kinds of minerals, much
of which located in grassland areas.<ref name="Ho 2016" /> In 2011 it was estimated that the potential value per capita of these resources accounted for 163.5 percent of the nation's average. Ningxia boasts verified coal reserves of over 30 billion tons, with an estimated reserve of more than 202 billion tons, ranking sixth nationwide. Coal deposits are spread over one-third of the total surface of Ningxia, and mined in four major fields in the Helan and Xiangshan mountains, Ningdong and Yuanzhou (or Guyuan). The region's reserves of oil and natural gas can be found in Yanchi and Lingwu County, and are ideal for large-scale development of oil, natural gas and chemical industries. Ningxia leads China in gypsum deposits, with a proven reserve of more than 4.5 billion tons, of which the rarely found, top-grade gypsum accounts for half of the total deposits. The Hejiakouzi deposit in Tongxin County features a reserve of 20 million tons of gypsum with a total thickness of 100 meters. There is a considerable deposit of quartz sandstone, of which 17 million tons have been ascertained. In addition, there are phosphorus, flint, copper, iron, barite, other minerals and Helan stone – a special clay stone.<ref name="britannica">{{Cite web |last1=Hsieh |first1=Chiao-min |last2=Falkenheim |first2=Victor C. |title=Ningxia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ningxia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027072307/https://www.britannica.com/place/Ningxia |archive-date=2016-10-27 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-03-16 |title=Níngxià kuàngchǎn zīyuán gàikuàng jí fēnbù |script-title=zh:宁夏矿产资源概况及分布 |trans-title=Overview and Distribution of Mineral Resources in Ningxia |url=http://www.chinabaike.com/z/keji/ck/543057.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112152114/http://www.chinabaike.com/z/keji/ck/543057.html |archive-date=2014-11-12 |website=Zhōngguó bǎikē wǎng |language=zh}}</ref>

{{main|Politics of Ningxia|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The politics of Ningxia is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

The Chairman of the Autonomous Region is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Ningxia. In its dual-party government system, the chairman has less power than the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) Ningxia Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Ningxia [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|CCP Party Chief]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Ningxia has a friendship agreement with [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county of Norway.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rivedal |first=Henning |date=17 July 2015 |title=Ningxia og Sogn og Fjordane eit steg vidare på samarbeidsvegen |trans-title=Ningxia and Sogn og Fjordane One Step Further on the Co-Operation Road |url=http://www.sfj.no/cmssff/cmspublish.nsf/$all/CDA4C0B3C7F54B53C1257234006C0E90?open |access-date=7 May 2015 |website=Sfj.no |language=no}}</ref>

[[Image:Rich Nature Wolfberry Farm1 7-06.jpg|thumb|[[Wolfberry]] harvest celebration.]] Rural Ningxia was for long an officially designated poverty area, and remains on the lower rungs of the developmental ladder.<ref name="Ho 2016" /> Its nominal GDP in 2023 was 531.50 billion yuan (US$75.43 billion) and its per capita GDP 72,957 yuan (US$10,353). It comprises 0.42% of the [[Economy of China|national economy]].

===Agriculture===
Similar to other areas, Ningxia has seen a gradual decline of its peasant population due to rural–urban migration. Despite this, the great majority (62.8 percent) was still agricultural at the time of the survey.<ref>Ningxia Bureau of Statistics 2013, 4.2</ref> Animal husbandry is important for the regional economy. In the main pastoral county, Yanchi, it is even the leading industry when specified for the primary sector. The dominant grazing animals are sheep and goat.<ref>Ningxia Bureau of Statistics 2013, 11.20</ref> In the (semi-)pastoral regions, herders engage in a mixed sedentary farming operation of dryland agriculture and extensive animal husbandry, while full nomadic pastoralism is no longer practiced.<ref name="Ho 2016"/> Since a cattle breeding plan was implemented in 2002, the province has become one of China's main dairy production areas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ningxia dairies see success in quantity, quality |url=https://regional.chinadaily.com.cn/en/2022-01/21/c_742792.htm |access-date=2024-08-19 |website=regional.chinadaily.com.cn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-16 |title=Ningxia's dairies achieve high-quality development with smart factories, advanced breeding techniques |url=https://www.bastillepost.com/global/article/4000510-ningxias-dairies-achieve-high-quality-development-with-smart-factories-advanced-breeding-techniques |access-date=2024-08-19 |website=www.bastillepost.com}}</ref>

Ningxia is the principal region of China where [[Wolfberry|wolfberries]] are grown. Other specialties of Ningxia are [[licorice]], products made from Helan stone, [[fiddlehead]] and products made from [[sheepskin]].

[[Ningxia wines]] are a promising area of development. The Chinese authorities have given approval to the development of the eastern base of the [[Helan Mountains]] as an area suitable for wine production. Several large Chinese wine companies including Changyu and Dynasty Wine have begun development in the western region of the province. Together they now own 20,000 acres of land for wine plantations and Dynasty has ploughed 100 million yuan into Ningxia. In addition, the major oil company [[China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation]] has founded a grape plantation near the Helan Mountains. The household appliance company [[Midea (company)|Midea]] has also begun participating in Ningxia's wine industry.<ref>[http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1102&MainCatID=11&id=20111215000020 "Grape expansion: Chinese wine companies move west"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731231303/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1102&MainCatID=11&id=20111215000020 |date=31 July 2015 }}, ''Want China Times'', 15 December 2011.

Spanning {{convert|32|km2|abbr=on}}, it has an annual economic output Rmb23.7 billion (25.1% up) (US$3.5 billion). Major investors are mainly local enterprises such as Kocel Steel Foundry, FAG Railway Bearing (Ningxia), Ningxia Little Giant Machine Tools, etc. Major industries include machinery and equipment manufacturing, new materials, fine chemicals and the animation industry.

Desheng Industrial Park (in [[Helan County]]) is a base for about 400 enterprises. The industrial park has industrial chains from Muslim food and commodities to trade and logistics, new materials and bio-pharmaceuticals that has 80 billion yuan in fixed assets. Desheng is looking to be the most promising industrial park in the city. It achieved a total output value of 4.85 billion in 2008, up 40 percent year-on-year. The local government plans to cut taxes and other fees to reduce the burden on local enterprises. The industrial output value reached 2.68 billion yuan in 2008, an increase of 48 percent from a year earlier.
