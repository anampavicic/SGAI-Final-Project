'''Panchkula''' ([[ISO 15919|ISO]]: ''Paṁcakulā'') is a city and district headquarter in the [[Panchkula district]] in [[Haryana]], India. It is a satellite town of the state capital [[Chandigarh]]. Panchkula is a border city with [[Punjab]], [[Chandigarh]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The origin of the name Panchkula came from "the place where five irrigation canals meet". It is approximately {{cvt|4|km}} southeast of Chandigarh, {{cvt|105|km}} southwest of [[Shimla]], {{cvt|44|km}} from [[Ambala]] and {{cvt|259|km}} northeast of [[New Delhi]], the national capital. It is a part of the [[Chandigarh capital region]] or Greater Chandigarh. The [[Chandigarh]]-[[Mohali]]-Panchkula metropolitan region collectively forms a [[Chandigarh Tricity]], with a combined population of over two million.

The city hosts the [[Chandimandir Cantonment]], the headquarters of the [[Western Command (India)|Western Command]] of the [[Indian Army]]. It is a planned city like [[Chandigarh]], with a sector system.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the local word ''panch'' ({{langx|sa|पंच}}) (''five'') ''kula'' ({{langx|sa|कुला}}) (''canals'') "The city of 5 canals", possibly referring to five irrigation canals that distribute water from the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar River]] and these kuls pass through the [[Chandimandir Cantonment]] area to [[Mata Mansa Devi Mandir]] area. Kuls or canals were made along the contours of the hillocks in a way that they collect the water upstream and convey it downstream at the contour height higher than the actual level of the Ghaggar river at the same spot.<ref name="HR-review">{{Cite web|title=Haryana Review 2013, page 30|url=http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/HR-Review-January-2013.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508155230/http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/HR-Review-January-2013.pdf|archive-date=8 May 2016|access-date=18 April 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://panchkula.nic.in/about-district/ Panchkula district profile], panchkula.nic.in, accessed 29 Sep 2021.</ref> One of the canals is called the Singh Nalla which was being beautified in 2021 by building a walking track and by planting plants and flowers.<ref>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/singh-nullah-beautification-notices-issued-to-residents/articleshow/86591508.cms Singh Nullah beautification: Notices issued to residents], Times of India, 29 Sep 2021.</ref>

==History==
[[File:Kalka Temple in Panchkula, in Haryana, photographed by Yogabrata Chakraborty, on June 4, 2023.jpg|thumb|Kalimata Temple in Kalka, Panchkula.]]
The city is named after Panchkula village, which is situated on the Ambala Kalka highway, near the junction with the Chandigarh road. The city was planned and developed by the state of Haryana in the 1970s. Panchkula was supposed to be the capital.

===Ramgarh Fort and Mata Mansa Devi Temple===
{{anchor | Ramgarh Fort and Mata Mansa Devi Temple }} 
The fort was built by the rulers of [[Kahlur|Kahlur State]], the headquarters of which was [[Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]] in Himachal Pradesh. The King of Bilaspur built the Ramgarh Fort 360 years ago.<ref name=harsamvad1>[http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf Haryana Samvad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225259/http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf |date=29 November 2018 }}, Oct 2018, p38-40.</ref> In 1687, its rulers offered [[Guru Gobind Singh]] a horse, a sword, and Rs 500000 when he was relocating his troops from [[Paonta Sahib]] to [[Anandpur Sahib]] after the [[Battle of Bhangani]]. In the 1750s, it eventually fell to the status of a fief under the [[Sirmur State]], but became independent again in 1804. It is currently occupied by the progeny of Kalee Chand, younger son of King of Bilaspur Sangar Chand (r. 1197–1220), and runs as a heritage hotel.

[[Mata Mansa Devi Mandir]] is a Hindu temple dedicated to [[Manasa|Goddess Mansa Devi]], a form of [[Shakti]], in the [[Panchkula district]] of Haryana state in India.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Himalayan Expressway, Village Tipra, Panchkula, Haryana.jpeg|thumb|[[Himalayan Expressway]], a section of NH5, near Panchkula]]
Panchkula district has a sub-tropical continental monsoon climate with hot summers, cool winters, and monsoon rainfall. It has great variation in temperature ({{cvt|-1 to 43|°C|disp=sqbr}}). Sometimes winter frost occurs during December and January. The district also receives winter rains from the western disturbance. The rainfall is mostly received in the monsoon. [[Morni]] hills constitute the highest point of the district as well as of Haryana. The [[Ghaggar]] is the only perennial river, which is very shallow outside of the monsoons. The mountains and hills of [[Kasauli]] are clearly visible from Panchkula.

Generally, the slope of the district is from northeast to southwest, and in this direction, most of the rivers/streams rain-fed torrents flow down and spread much gravel and pebbles in their beds. Only the Sirsa River, in [[Kalka]] Tehsil flows towards the northwest. The soils in the district are mainly light [[loam]].

The underground water in the district is generally fresh and suitable for domestic and irrigation purposes. The underground water level is generally high in the southern parts and low in the north and northeast which is a hilly tract. The district lies in the [[Himalayas]] boundary fault zones and earthquakes of moderate to high intensity have occurred in the past.
