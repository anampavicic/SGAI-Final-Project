== Prefectural overview ==
Situated among the inland prefectures of the northern part of the Kantō region, Tochigi is contiguous with Ibaraki, Gunma, Saitama, and Fukushima Prefectures.

The climate of Tochigi may be classified as a humid temperate zone with broad variations in temperature. Winters are arid with dry winds, while summers are humid with frequent thunderstorms.

The population of Tochigi as of November 2010 is approximately 2,005,096.

Located in the center of the prefecture is the largest open plain in the Kantō region. Shirane ({{convert|2,578|m|}}), Nantai ({{convert|2,484|m|}}) and Nasudake ({{convert|1,917|m|}}) mountain are in the northern part of the area. Kinugawa, Nakagawa, and Watarase River originate in this region, which flow across the Kanto plain before emptying into the Pacific Ocean.  Tochigi is the 20th largest prefecture in Japan with a total area of 6,408.09 square km.

As of 1 April 2012, 21% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely [[Nikkō National Park]], [[Oze National Park]], and eight Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=1 April 2012 |access-date=18 November 2013}}</ref>

== History ==
{{see also|Historic Sites of Tochigi Prefecture}}

Before the [[Meiji Restoration]], Tochigi was known as [[Shimotsuke Province]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref>

In the early 15th century, the [[Ashikaga Gakkō]], Japan's oldest school of higher education, was re-established in the prefecture, holding over 3,000 students by the 16th century. Saint [[Francis Xavier]] introduced Ashikaga to the world as the best university in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}}

In the early 17th century, Japan was unified under the [[shōgun]] [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. After his death, the [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Nikko Tōshō-gū]] shrine was built in [[Nikkō]] in 1617 on what the shōguns thought of as holy ground to protect and worship Ieyasu. Its establishment brought Nikkō to national attention.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Ieyasu's successors as [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa shogun]] developed the [[Nikkō Kaidō]] (日光街道, part of the major road connecting Nikkō with [[Edo]]) and acquired lavish processions to worship Ieyasu. 

In the late 19th century, the Tokugawa shogunate fell and the new government established the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]].  The prefectural capital was established in the city of Tochigi after the unification of Utsunomiya Prefecture and Tochigi Prefecture in 1873.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tochigi Prefecture / History |url=http://www.pref.tochigi.lg.jp/english/intro/history.html |website=Tochigi Prefecture |publisher=Tochigi Prefectural Office |access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref> By 1884, however, the capital was transferred to Utsunomiya.

In March 2011, following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], levels of [[radioactivity]] in Utsunomiya were 33 times higher than normal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenworldinvestor.com/2011/03/15/nuclear-radiation-levels-and-effect-on-human-health-as-sieverts-increase-in-japan-what-you-need-to-know/|title=Nuclear Radiation Levels and Effect on Human Health as Sieverts increase in Japan – What you need to Know - Green World Investor|website=greenworldinvestor.com|access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref>
