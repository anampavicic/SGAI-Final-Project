The first Portuguese settlers arrived in this region during the eighteenth century.
In 1707 they formed three great ranches: Jaiba, Olhos d'Água and Montes Claros.

In order to get his cattle to market Figueira opened up roads to [[Tranqueiras]] in [[Bahia]] and to the [[São Francisco River]]
Soon the Fazenda de Montes Claros became the greatest producer of cattle in the north of Minas Gerais,
and a small village was formed.

In 1810 the town was made a bishopric. In 1831 the settlement had grown to a village and was renamed to Vila de Montes Claros de Formigas.
In 1847 the first doctor arrived and set up practice.  
By 1857, Vila Montes Claros de Formigas had around 2,000 inhabitants and became the city of Montes Claros.

The 20th century brought fast development to the city.
