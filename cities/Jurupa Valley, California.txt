'''Jurupa Valley''' ([[Serrano people|Serrano]]: ''Hurumpa'') is a [[city]] in the northwest corner of [[Riverside County, California]], United States. It was the location of one of the earliest non-native settlements in the county, [[Rancho Jurupa]]. The Rancho was initially an outpost of the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel]], then a [[Mexican land grant]] in 1838. The name is derived from a Native American village that existed in the area prior to the arrival of Europeans.

On March 8, 2011, voters approved a [[Popular initiative|ballot measure]], Measure A, to [[municipal corporation|incorporate]] and form the city of ''Jurupa Valley''.  The effective date of incorporation was July 1, 2011.<ref name="P-E">{{cite news |last1=Stokley |first1=Sandra |title=Jurupa: Cityhood is approved |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/riverside/stories/PE_News_Local_D_wcity09.1c6fd801c.html |access-date=March 29, 2021 |work=[[The Press-Enterprise]] |date=March 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205020937/http://www.pe.com/local-news/riverside-county/riverside/riverside-headlines-index/20110309-jurupa-cityhood-is-approved.ece |archive-date=December 5, 2012 |url-status=dead}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Residents of the area had previously voted on incorporation in 1992, but rejected that measure, along with a competing ballot measure that would have incorporated [[Mira Loma, California|Mira Loma]].<ref name="P-E"/> Jurupa Valley was the latest city in the state of California to incorporate until 2024 when [[Mountain House, California|Mountain House]] incorporated in [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]].

The city of Jurupa Valley covers approximately {{convert|43.5|mi2|km2}}, and had a population of 105,053 as of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]]. It is bordered by the cities of [[Eastvale, California|Eastvale]], [[Norco, California|Norco]], and [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] in Riverside County and the cities of [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], [[Fontana, California|Fontana]], [[Rialto, California|Rialto]], Bloomington and [[Colton, California|Colton]] in neighboring [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]].

== History ==
The area was first inhabited by the Gabrielino Tribe and the Serrano Tribe.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.jurupavalley.org/309/About-Us#:~:text=In%201838%2C%20the%20area%20became,was%20a%20Riverside%20mailing%20address | title=About Us &#124; Jurupa Valley, CA }}</ref>

[[File:Juan_Bandini_portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Jurupa Valley traces its history to [[Rancho Jurupa]], a Mexican-era [[ranchos of California|rancho]] granted to Don [[Juan Bandini]], a noted [[Californio]] entrepreneur, in 1838.]]

===Etymology===
{{See also|List of Riverside County, California, placename etymologies#Jurupa Valley|label 1=List of Riverside County, California, placename etymologies: Jurupa Valley}}

Although there was no geographic feature or town officially named ''Jurupa Valley'' prior to the establishment of the city in 2011, the term ''Jurupa Valley'' is known to have been used as early as 1887 when referring to lands along the northeast side of the [[Santa Ana River]] opposite the [[Riverside, California|city of Riverside]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fruit Growers; Annual State Convention |work=Riverside Daily Press |issue=88 |volume=II |publisher=L. M. Holt |date=April 15, 1887 |location=Riverside, CA |page=2}}</ref>   The name ''Jurupa'' was derived from the 1838 [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] [[Rancho Jurupa]], which the Jurupa Valley area had been part of. The Rancho in turn derived its name from a previous Jurupa rancho operated by the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel]], until the mission was disbanded through the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].<ref name="1902Caballeria" /> The first rancho was named for the Native American village Jurupa that existed in the area prior to the arrival of Mexican colonizers.<ref>Patterson, p. 120.</ref>  Both [[Serrano people|Serrano]] and [[Gabrieleño]] peoples lived in the area. The Gabrieleño referred to the village as ''Jurungna'' or ''Hurungna''.<ref>Johnston, p.21.</ref>

The exact meaning of the word ''Jurupa'' is disputed. The 1890 book, ''An Illustrated History of Southern California'', states that the word Jurupa was a greeting, meaning ″peace and friendship″, used by the Native Americans when the first Catholic priest visited the area.<ref>Lewis, p.410.</ref> In 1902 Father Juan Caballeria, in his ''History of San Bernardino Valley; From the Padres to the Pioneer'', states that the word was derived from ''Jurumpa'', meaning watering place.<ref name="1902Caballeria">Caballería, pp. 38-39</ref> Later linguistic studies concluded that the name likely refers to ''Juru'', the [[Artemisia californica]] (California sagebrush), common in the area.<ref>Patterson, p. 121.</ref>

=== Incorporation ===
On June 2, 1992, under measures E, F, and G, the first effort to form a city was voted down by the electorate. Measure E, whether or not to incorporate Jurupa and Mira Loma, lost 76% to 24%. Measure F, whether to vote city council members by district or at large, if incorporation passed, was 69% district, and 31% at large. Measure G, the selection of a city name, had the following results; Jurupa 40%, Rancho Jurupa 23%, West Riverside 21%, and Camino Real 16%.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Election Returns; Riverside County |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/69886426/election-results-riverside-county/ |access-date=February 11, 2021 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |issue=184 |volume=CXI |publisher=The Times Mirror Company |date=June 4, 1992 |location=Los Angeles, CA |page=21}}</ref> At the time Jurupa was described as including the neighborhoods of Rubidoux, Pedley and Glen Avon.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mira Loma and Jurupa to vote for cityhood |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/69885787/mira-loma-and-jurupa-to-vote-for/ |access-date=February 11, 2021 |newspaper=Chino Champion |publisher=Allan P. McCombs |date=February 21, 1992 |location=Chino, CA |page=29}}</ref>

On March 8, 2011, a second proposal for incorporation was put before the voters. This time the measure passed with 54% voting yes, 46% voting no, and with an effective date of July 1, 2011. At the time the new city was estimated to have a population of 88,000, and included the communities of Mira Loma, Glen Avon, Sky Country, Indian Hills, Pedley, Rubidoux, Belltown, Jurupa, Jurupa Hills, and Sunnyslope.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jurupa Valley Incorporation Election, Measure A (March 2011) |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Jurupa_Valley_Incorporation_Election,_Measure_A_(March_2011) |website=Ballotpedia |access-date=February 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213205606/https://ballotpedia.org/Jurupa_Valley_Incorporation_Election,_Measure_A_%28March_2011%29 |archive-date=February 13, 2021}}</ref>

The city immediately faced the possibility of disincorporation when the State of California passed Senate Bill 89, which shifted millions of dollars of vehicle license fees away from cities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sangree |first1=Hudson |title=Cities Fear Loss of Public Safety Aid |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/70146300/california-senate-bill-89-jul-2-2011/ |access-date=February 12, 2021 |newspaper=The Sacramento Bee |publisher=McClatchey Company |date=July 2, 2011 |location=Sacramento, CA |pages=[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/70146300/california-senate-bill-89-jul-2-2011/ 13], [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/70146841/california-senate-bill-89-jul-2-2011/ 16]}}</ref> The new city struggled for several years, and in 2014 notified the ''Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission'' that it might be necessary to disincorporate. In September 2015, Senate Bill 25 was passed by the California Assembly and Senate to restore funding to cities, but was vetoed by then Governor [[Jerry Brown]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Assembly OKs bill to provide financial relief to local cities |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/70219431/california-assembly-approves-sb-25-sep/ |access-date=February 13, 2021 |newspaper=The Desert Sun |issue=325 |volume=88 |publisher=The Desert Sun Publishing Co. |date=September 6, 2015 |location=Palm Springs, CA |page=14}}</ref> Later in the month Senate Bill 107 was signed by the governor. It remediated many of the outstanding debts of Jurupa Valley, as well as three other recently incorporated cities in Riverside County.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McGreevy |first1=Patrick |last2= Mason |first2=Melanie |title=Brown OKs plan to target blight |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/70236907/california-governor-brown-signs-senate/ |access-date=February 13, 2021 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |issue=294 |volume=CXXXIV |date=September 23, 2015 |location=Los Angeles, CA |page=11}}</ref>
