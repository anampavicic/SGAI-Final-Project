'''San Juan''', officially the '''Municipality of San Juan''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng San Juan}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Batangas]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 114,068 people.{{PH census|current}}

The town is known for its baroque church, ancestral houses, the [[Pinagbayanan excavation]], the most important archaeological site in the municipality, and the famous [[Laiya Beach]].

==History==
San Juan used to be called '''Bolbok''' during the Spanish colonial period up to the 1920s. In the years 1698 until 1836, it was just a barrio of the large town of [[Rosario, Batangas|Rosario]] located in the eastern part of Batangas. From 1837, the barrio was governed by ''tinientes'' or deputies with a term of one to two years. However, when the barrio was recognized as a separate town in 1843, the position of ''tinientes'' was replaced by ''cabezas de barangay'' serving one for each new barrio. It was only in 1848 when the Spanish government officially recognized the independence of San Juan from its mother town of Rosario and was given the name San Juan de Bocboc.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sanjuanbatangas.gov.ph/about-us/history|title= A Glimpse of History|publisher=sanjuanbatangas.gov.ph}}</ref>

San Juan was headed by a [[Gobernadorcillo]] in 1864. The first Gobernadorcillo was Don Camilo Perez, a prominent citizen who initiated the separation of San Juan from Rosario. He is considered as the founder of the town, and was honored for his contribution in public works and peace and order in the newly created town.

On October 28, 1883, San Juan experienced a major disaster due to continuous winds and intense storm rain. Huge flood from the Bancoro and Bangbang Rivers hit the town resulting to the destruction of houses, drowning of livestocks and planted crops, and the devastation of the church and its convent. In 1886, the flooding become worse in the town. The parish priest had to erect a temporary church and convent in a site seven kilometers away from the town.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://minerdescent.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3-san-juan-batangas-leon-mayo-paper.pdf |title= The San Juan Batangas Legacy|publisher=Arch. Leon M. Mayo}}</ref>

On January 18, 1886, the officials of the town initiated the transfer of the new town to Calitcalit. The transfer of the Lumang Bayan to its present location was approved by [[Governor General]] [[Valeriano Weyler]] on December 12, 1890, during the administration of Gobernadorcillo Benedicto De Villa. San Juan de Bocboc was renamed to Bolbok by virtue of Act No. 2390 dated February 28, 1914.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l8afa|chamber=Act|number=2390|title=An Act Changing the names of the municipalities of Santo Niño and Mawanan, Province of Cagayan; San Isidro Labrador and San Isidro de Potot, Province of Pangasinan; San Francisco de Malabon and Santa Cruz de Malabon, Province of Cavite; Nagpartian and San Miguel, Province of Ilocos Norte; Langaran, Province of Misamis; San Pedro Tunasan, Province of Laguna; Cabagan Nuevo, Province of Isabela; Nueva Caceres, Province of Ambos Camarines; San Pedro Macati, Province of Rizal; San Juan de Bocboc, Province of Batangas; San Juan, Province of Nueva Ecija; township of Barrit - Luluno, Province of Ilocos Sur, and of the Barrios of Tublijon and Gibigaan, Municipality of Sorsogon, Province of Sorsogon.|date=February 28, 1914|accessdate=July 18, 2022}}</ref> In the early years of 1920, Bolbok was then renamed as San Juan, in honor of [[John of Nepomuk|San Juan Nepomuceno]], the town's patron saint.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://site.sanjuanbatangas.gov.ph/main/3000/index.asp?pageid=117602&t=history|title= A Glimpse of History|publisher=sanjuanbatangas.gov.ph}}</ref>

On April 4, 1945, the town was liberated from Japanese occupation by the F Company, 188th Infantry of the United States Army as part of their clearing operations to liberate the Bicol peninsula from the hands of the Japanese.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Batangas History|url=https://www.batangashistory.date/2018/03/liberate.html|title=DATES WHEN EACH TOWN OF BATANGAS WAS LIBERATED FROM THE JAPANESE IN WWII|author=Buhay Batangas|date=March 3, 2018|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref>
