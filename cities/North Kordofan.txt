'''North Kordofan''' ({{langx|ar|شمال كردفان|Šamāl Kurdufān}}) is one of the 18 [[States of Sudan|wilayat]] or states of [[Sudan]]. It has an area of 185,302&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and an estimated population of 3,174,029 people (2018 est). [[El-Obeid]] is the capital of the state.

North Kordofan is generally arid and desert.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== History ==
For centuries, North Kordofan was inhabited by nomads and pastoralists, mainly the Dar Hamid, Dar Hamar, Guamaa, Kababish, Bideriya, Shwehat and including the Yazeed tribes.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} The area has had almost continuous drought since the mid-1960s. Deforestation led to the destruction of the natural vegetation. NGOs working in the villages of Sudan tried to rectify the damage. They set up women's centres. These centres allowed many women gain an income. Training was introduced and a solar energy system set up. NGOs recognise that a need exists for longer projects requiring the kind of support that only can come from governments and large agencies.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
