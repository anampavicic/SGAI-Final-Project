'''Bodrum''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈbodɾum}}) is a small city and [[Districts of Turkey|district]] of [[Muğla Province]], [[Turkey]].<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Büyükşehir İlçe Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 19 September 2023.</ref> About 200 thousand people live in the district,<ref name="tuik" /> which covers 650&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harita.gov.tr/uploads/files-folder/il_ilce_alanlari.xlsx|title=İl ve İlçe Yüz ölçümleri|publisher=General Directorate of Mapping|access-date=19 September 2023}}</ref> and includes the city. It is a port city at the entrance to the [[Gulf of Gökova]]. Known in ancient times as [[Halicarnassus]], the city was once home to the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], also known as the tomb of Mausolus, one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The city was founded by [[Dorians|Dorian Greeks]]. It later fell under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule and became the capital city of the [[satrapy]] of [[Caria]]. [[Mausolus]] ruled Caria from here, and after his death in 353 BC, his wife [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]] built a tomb, called the Mausoleum, for him. [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] forces laid [[Siege of Halicarnassus|siege to the city]] and captured it in 334 BC. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, the city passed to successive [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] rulers and was briefly an independent kingdom until 129 BC, when it came under [[Asia (Roman province)|Roman rule]]. A series of natural disasters and repeated pirate attacks wreaked havoc on the area, and the city lost its importance by the time of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]]. The [[Knights Hospitaller]] arrived in 1402 and used the remains of the Mausoleum as a quarry to build [[Bodrum Castle]]. After the [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|conquest of Rhodes]] by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1522, the town fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman control]] as the Knights Hospitaller relocated to Europe.

By the 20th century, the city's economy was mainly based on fishing and [[sponge diving]], but tourism has become the main industry in Bodrum since the late 20th century. The abundance of visitors has also contributed to Bodrum's retail and service industry. [[Milas–Bodrum Airport]] and [[Kos International Airport]] are the main airports that serve the city. The port has ferries to other nearby Turkish and Greek ports and islands, [[Kos]] being the most important. Most of the public transportation in the city is based on local [[share taxi]]s and buses.

== Etymology ==
The modern name ''Bodrum'' derives from the town's [[Middle Ages|medieval]] name ''Petronium'', which has its roots in the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitaller]] [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of St. Peter]].{{Cn|date=September 2024}}

In [[classical antiquity]], Bodrum was known as [[Halicarnassus]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἁλικαρνασσός}},<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%28alikarnasso%2Fs Ἁλικαρνασσός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus project</ref> {{langx|tr|Halikarnas}}), a major city in ancient [[Caria]]. The suffix -{{lang|grc|ασσός}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|-assos}}) of Greek {{lang|grc|Ἁλικαρνᾱσσός}} is indicative of a [[Pre-Greek substrate|substrate]] toponym, meaning that an original non-Greek name influenced or established the place's name. It has been proposed that the {{lang|grc|-καρνασσός}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|-karnassos}}) part is [[cognate]] with [[Luwian language|Luwian]] word "{{lang|hlu-Latn|ha+ra/i-na-sà}}", which means fortress.<ref>Ilya Yakubovich. "Phoenician and Luwian in Early Age Cilicia". ''Anatolian Studies'' '''65''' (2015): 44, [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anatolian-studies/article/phoenician-and-luwian-in-early-iron-age-cilicia/A0B118B2157EE820FA657A28160B0A21 doi:10.1017/S0066154615000010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923122933/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anatolian-studies/article/phoenician-and-luwian-in-early-iron-age-cilicia/A0B118B2157EE820FA657A28160B0A21|date=2016-09-23}}.</ref> If so, the city's ancient name was probably borrowed from [[Carian language|Carian]], a [[Anatolian languages#Luwic branch|Luwic language]] native to pre-Greek Western [[Anatolia]]. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with 𐊠𐊣𐊫𐊰 𐊴𐊠𐊥𐊵𐊫𐊰 (''alos k̂arnos)'' in inscriptions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=alQqw2IxJO0C&pg=228|title=The Carian Language|last=Lajara|first=Ignacio-Javier Adiego|date=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004152816|language=en}}</ref>

==History==

=== Ancient era ===
{{See also|Halicarnassus}}
Halicarnassus ({{langx|grc|Ἁλικαρνᾱσσός|Halikarnassós}}, or {{lang|grc|Ἀλικαρνασσός}} ''Alikarnassós''; {{langx|tr|Halikarnas}}), was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city at the site of modern Bodrum in [[Turkey]]. Halicarnassus was founded by [[Dorians|Dorian]] Greeks, and the figures on its coins, such as the head of [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]], [[Athena]], [[Poseidon]], and the [[trident]], support the statement that the mother cities were [[Troezen]] and [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Halicarnassus |volume=12 |page=837 |first=David George |last=Hogarth}}</ref> The inhabitants appear to have accepted [[Anthas|Anthes]], a son of Poseidon, as their legendary founder, as mentioned by [[Strabo]], and were proud of the title ''Antheadae''. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with Alosδkarnosδ in inscriptions.

In an early period, Halicarnassus was a member of the [[Doric Hexapolis]], which included [[Kos]], [[Cnidus]], [[Lindos]], [[Kameiros]], and [[Ialysus]]; but it was expelled from the league when one of its citizens, Agasicles, took home the prize tripod that he had won in the Triopian games instead of dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian [[Apollo]]. In the early 5th century, Halicarnassus was under the sway of [[Artemisia I of Caria]] (also known as Artemesia of Halicarnassus<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Artemisia (daughter of Lygdamis) |volume=2 |page=665 }}</ref>), who made herself famous as a naval commander at the [[battle of Salamis]]. Little is known of Pisindalis, her son and successor; but [[Lygdamis II of Halicarnassus|Lygdamis]], the [[tyrant]] of Halicarnassus, who next attained power, is notorious for having the poet [[Panyasis]] put to death and forcing [[Herodotus]], possibly the most well-known Halicarnassian, to leave his native city ({{Circa|457 BC}}).<ref>{{cite book|title=Suda|chapter=Herodotus|chapter-url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&search_method=QUERY&login=guest&enlogin=guest&user_list=LIST&page_num=1&searchstr=herodotus&field=hw_eng|title-link=Suda}} At the Suda On Line Project.</ref>

}}The city later fell under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. Under the Persians, it was the capital city of the [[satrapy]] of [[Caria]], the region that long afterward constituted its hinterland and of which it was the principal port. Its strategic location ensured that the city enjoyed considerable autonomy. Archaeological evidence from the period, such as the recently discovered [[Salmacis (Caria)|Salmakis]] (''Kaplankalesi'') Inscription, now in [[Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology]], attests to the particular pride its inhabitants had developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1998/123pdf/123001.pdf |title = The Pride of Halicarnassus|author=Signe Isager|publisher=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 123 p. 1-23|year=1998}}</ref>

[[Mausolus]] ruled Caria from here, nominally on behalf of the Persians but practically independently, for much of his reign from 377 to 353 BC. When he died in 353 BC, [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who was both his sister and his widow, employed the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Architecture|architects]] [[Satyros]], [[Pythius of Priene|Pythis]], and the [[Sculpture|sculptors]] [[Bryaxis]], [[Scopas]], [[Leochares]], and [[Timotheus (sculptor)|Timotheus]] to build a monument and a tomb for him. The word "[[mausoleum]]" derives from the structure of this tomb. It was a temple-like structure decorated with reliefs and statuary on a massive base. Today only the foundations and a few pieces of sculpture remain.

=== Hellenistic and Roman periods ===
[[Alexander the Great]] laid [[Siege of Halicarnassus|siege to the city]] after his arrival in the Carian lands and, together with his ally, Queen [[Ada of Caria]], captured it after fighting in 334 BC. After Alexander's death, the rule of the city passed to [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus I]] (311 BC), [[Lysimachus]] (after 301 BC), and the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] (281–197 BC) and was briefly an independent kingdom until 129 BC, when it came under Roman rule. A series of earthquakes destroyed much of the city, as well as the great Mausoleum, while repeated pirate attacks from the Mediterranean wreaked further havoc on the area. By the time of the early Christian [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era, when Halicarnassus was an important bishopric, there was little left of the shining city of Mausoluos.<ref>[https://www.worldhistory.org/halicarnassus/ worldhistory.org]</ref>

=== Medieval era ===
[[File:Bodrum_-_panoramio_(10).jpg|thumb|[[Bodrum Castle]] coat of arms|alt=|left]]Crusader Knights arrived in 1402 and used the remains of the Mausoleum as a quarry to build the still impressively standing [[Bodrum Castle]] (''Castle of Saint Peter''), a well-preserved example of late Crusader architecture in the eastern Mediterranean. The [[Knights Hospitaller]] (''Knights of St. John'') were given permission to build it by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed I]] after [[Tamerlane]] destroyed their previous fortress in [[İzmir]]'s inner bay. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 1522, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|conquered the base of the Crusader knights]] on the island of [[Rhodes]], who then relocated first briefly to [[Sicily]] and later permanently to [[Malta]], leaving the Castle of Saint Peter and Bodrum to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

===Modern era===
Bodrum was a quiet town of fishermen and [[sponge diving|sponge divers]] until the early 20th century. From 1867 until 1922, it was part of the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the 1923 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]], the [[Anatolian Greeks|Greeks]] of Bodrum settled in [[Nea Alikarnassos]], Crete in exchange for Muslims of [[Crete]]. In her book ''Bodrum'', Fatma Mansur points out that the presence of a large community of bilingual [[Cretan Turks]], coupled with the conditions of free trade and access to the southern [[Dodecanese]] islands until 1935, made the town less provincial.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bodrum |isbn=90-04-03424-2|author= Fatma Mansur|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]| year= 1972}}</ref> The fact that traditional agriculture was not a very rewarding activity in the rather dry peninsula also prevented the formation of a class of large landowners. Bodrum has no notable history of political or religious extremism. A first nucleus of intellectuals started to form after the 1950s around the writer [[Cevat Şakir Kabaağaçlı]], who first came here in exile two decades previously and was charmed by the town to the point of adopting the [[pen name]] ''Halikarnas Balıkçısı'' ('The Fisherman of Halicarnassus').<ref>''Bodream'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Anagramme Ed., 2010, pp.62–66</ref>

[[File:Bodrum castle 3.JPG|thumb|350px|The [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of St. Peter]] was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller]].]]
The [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of St. Peter]], also known as Bodrum Castle, is one of the main attractions of the peninsula. The castle was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] during the 15th century, and the walls of the fortification contain pieces of the ruins of the Mausoleum, which was used as a source of construction materials. The Castle of Bodrum retains its original design and character of the Knights' period and reflects [[Gothic architecture]].<ref name=":7">{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6121/|title=The Bodrum Castle|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> It also contains the [[Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology]], a museum established by the Turkish government in 1962 to host the underwater discoveries of ancient shipwrecks in the [[Aegean Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodrum-museum.com|title=Bodrum Museum|date=2010-03-23|publisher=Bodrum Museum|access-date=2012-06-26}}</ref> In 2016, the castle was included in the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Turkey (Tentative list)|Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey]].<ref name=":7" /> The castle has been under renovation since 2017, and only some parts of it are accessible to visitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kenttv.net/bodrum-kalesi-ziyarete-acildi|title=Bodrum Kalesi Ziyarete Açıldı...|last=Codingest|date=2019-05-18|website=Kent TV|language=tr|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>

Built in the fourth century BC, the ruins of the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] are also among the main sights in Bodrum. The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]  was a tomb designed by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Architecture of ancient Greece|architects]] and built for [[Mausolus]], a [[satrap]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], and his [[sister-wife]] [[Artemisia II of Caria]].<ref name="Kostof">{{cite book|title=A History of Architecture|last=Kostof|first=Spiro|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-19-503473-2|location=Oxford|page=9}}</ref> The structure was considered one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]],.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/artarchaeologyarchitect/g/Masoleum.htm|title=Mausoleum of Halicarnassus|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221201016/http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/artarchaeologyarchitect/g/Masoleum.htm|archive-date=21 February 2014|access-date=5 February 2014}}</ref> By the 12th century CE, the structure had largely been destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmuseum.org/maus.htm|title=The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|access-date=5 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodrumpages.com/English/mausoleum.html|title=The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus|access-date=5 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="Gloag">{{cite book|title=Guide to Western Architecture|last=Gloag|first=John|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group|year=1969|edition=Revised|page=362|orig-year=1958}}</ref> Today, the ruins of the tomb continue to attract both domestic and international tourists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/kultur-sanat/halikarnas-mozolesinin-kalintilari-dahi-ilgi-cekiyor/1160650|title=Halikarnas Mozolesi'nin kalıntıları dahi ilgi çekiyor|website=www.aa.com.tr|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> It is planned to turn the ruins into an [[open-air museum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arkeolojikhaber.com/haber-halikarnas-mozolesi-acik-hava-muzesi-projesi-anlatildi-14500/|title=Halikarnas Mozolesi Açık Hava Müzesi projesi anlatıldı haberi|website=Arkeolojik Haber|date=14 July 2018 |access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>

==Government==
The district of Bodrum is one of 957 in Turkey. It is in [[Muğla Province]], which is part of the [[Aydın Subregion|Aydin Subregion]], which, in turn, is part of the [[Aegean Region]]. Bodrum became a sub-district{{Clarify|date=September 2024}} of the Ottoman Empire in 1871 and a district of Muğla Province in 1872. Bodrum Municipality operates with its 18 directorates and subsidiary units in the entire Bodrum Peninsula, which covers an area of 689&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a coastline of 215&nbsp;km. The organizational structure of Bodrum Municipality is composed of the mayor, four deputy mayors, and 18 directorates.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://bodrum.bel.tr/about-us.html|title=About us – Bodrum Belediyesi|website=Bodrum Municipality|language=en|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>

Bodrum Municipality served as the sole district municipality in the Bodrum region for many years. With the increase in the population of the peninsula, a town municipality called Karatoprak ([[Turgutreis]]) was established in 1967. The increase in the population also led to the establishment of the [[Mumcular, Bodrum|Mumcular]] (1972), [[Yalıkavak]] (1989), and [[Gündoğan, Bodrum|Gündoğan]] Municipalities (1992).<ref name=":6" />

Following the new municipality law of 1999, many villages in Bodrum were turned into towns: [[Ortakent Yahşi, Bodrum|Ortakent-Yahşi]] with the integration of Ortakent and Yahşi villages, [[Göltürkbükü]] with the integration of Gölköy, and [[Türkbükü]] and [[Yalı, Bodrum|Yalı]] with the integration of Yalı and Kızılağaç villages. The same year, the municipalities of [[Gümüşlük]], [[Konacık]], and [[Bitez]] were also founded, raising the number of municipalities in the Bodrum Peninsula to 11.<ref name=":6" />

After Muğla Province received [[metropolitan municipality]] status, these town municipalities were abolished, and all towns across the province were integrated into the city of Bodrum. Since March 30, 2014, the peninsula has been governed as a sole municipality.<ref name=":6" />

==Economy==
[[File:YalikavakPalmarina.jpg|thumb|Yalıkavak Marina is a luxury port and shopping mall in Yalıkavak, Bodrum]]
[[File:Bodrummarina.jpg|thumb|Milta Bodrum Marina]]During the 20th century, the city's economy was mainly based on fishing and sponge diving. Even though naked sponge diving in the Aegean region can be traced back at least 3,000 years, modern sponge diving became prevalent in Bodrum after [[Kos#Turkish population|Koan]] and [[Cretan Turks|Cretan immigrants]] settled in the city in the early 1920s, after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://bodrumdenizmuzesi.org/en/sponge-fishing/|title=Sponge-fishing – Bodrum Maritime Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> During its golden age between 1945 and 1965, about 150 boats engaged in sponge diving activities in Bodrum. However, sponge diseases, artificial sponge production, and a ban on sponge diving eventually ended this lucrative industry.<ref name=":3" />[[File:Turkey.Bodrum023.jpg|thumb|''[[Gulet]]'' type [[schooner]]s near Bodrum|alt=|left]]

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Bodrum_Akçabük_Evleri_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional white houses in Bodrum.]]Traditional Bodrum houses are characterized by their prismatic shapes, simple designs and locally sourced building materials like stone, wood, clay and cane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aysel|first=Nezih|date=May 2003|title=Bodrum-Ortakent (Müsgebi)'de Geleneksel Ev Tipleri Üzerine Bir İnceleme|url=https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/209278|journal=Dergipark|volume=3|pages=17–18}}</ref> They also tend to have white dominated exterior walls with some blue parts (doors, windows).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/yasam/bodrumun-beyazi-hasereye-mavisi-nazara/894454|title=Bodrum'un beyazı 'haşereye' mavisi 'nazara'|website=www.aa.com.tr|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref> The tradition of white-washed walls is associated with the bug and scorpion repellent properties of lime, which is found in white paint.

According to [[Muğla]] Municipality, in order to acquire a building permit one has to agree to paint the walls of the new building white.

The old bus station still has the interdistrict buses, but [[intercity bus service]]s to other locations in Turkey were redirected to the new station.
