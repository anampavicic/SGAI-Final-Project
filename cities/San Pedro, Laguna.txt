'''San Pedro''', officially the '''City of San Pedro''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng San Pedro}}), is a 3rd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]].

San Pedro has been dubbed as “dormitory town” of [[Metro Manila]] and migrants from other provinces commuting everyday through its highly efficient road and transport system. Despite being one of the smallest political units in the entire province, with a total land area of only {{convert|24.05|km2|sp=us}}, San Pedro is the 5th most populous city (out of 6) after the cities of [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], [[Santa Rosa City, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Biñan]] and [[Cabuyao]]. The city also has the highest population density in the province of Laguna and in the whole [[Calabarzon]] region, having {{convert|14,000|PD/km2|sp=us}}.<ref name="History"/> As a first class municipality, it became a component city of Laguna by virtue of Republic Act No. 10420 dated March 27, 2013.<ref name="San Pedro City">{{cite web|url=http://calabarzon.dilg.gov.ph/132-old-lgus/old-laguna-lgus/597-san-pedro-city|title=San Pedro City|website=DILG}}{{Dead link|date=June 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name of San Pedro originates from its old name: San Pedro [de] Tunasán. The first part of the name comes from Spanish for its [[patron saint]], [[Saint Peter]];<ref name="History"/> while the second part comes from ''Tunasán'', which literally means "a place where there is Tunás" (''[[Nymphaea nouchali]]''),<ref>[http://www.stuartxchange.com/Lauas.html ''Nymphaea nouchali'']</ref> a medicinal plant abundant on the shoreline of [[Laguna de Bay]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Olivares |first1=Anastacio |title=Kasaysayan ng Bayang San Pedro Tunasan (1574-1961) |date=1963 |publisher=Liberty Press Co. |location=Manila}}</ref> [[Tunasan]] is also the name of a neighboring barangay in [[Muntinlupa]], located just north of San Pedro. In 1914, by virtue of Act No. 2390, the town's name was abbreviated to its current iteration.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=2390|date=February 28, 1914 |title=An Act Changing; the Names of the Municipalities of Santo Nino and Mawanan, Province of Cagayan; San Isidro Labrador and San Isidro de Potot, Province of Pangasinan; San Francisco de Malabon and Santa Cruz de Malabon, Province of Cavite; Nagpartian and San Miguel, Province of Ilocos Norte; Langaran, Province of Misamis; San Pedro Tunasan, Province of Laguna; Cabagan Nuevo, Province of Isabela; Nueva Caceres, Province of Ambos Camarines; San Pedro Macati, Province of Rizal; San Juan de Bocboc, Province of Batangas; San Juan, Province of Nueva Ecija; Township of Barrit-luluno, Province of Ilocos Sur, and of the Barrios of Tublijon and Gibigaan, Municipality of Sorsogon, Province of Sorsogon|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l8afa |website=Lawyerly.Ph}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-Colonial Period (900-1565)===
{{stack|float=right|[[File:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] is the oldest historical document found in the Philippines. It has the first historical reference to [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] and dates back to [[Shaka era|Saka]] 822 (c. 900).]]}}

While there is no archaeological evidence yet that indicate precolonial settlement in the present-day city of San Pedro, the area where the modern city of San Pedro is believed to be part of the native settlement of the [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]] centuries before Spanish contact. It is believed that the [[Laguna de Bay]] and the San Isidro River gave livelihood and food to the early settlers. As the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] dated back to 900 AD was found in [[Lumban, Laguna]], this gives an idea that the area of San Pedro may had an independent [[Barangay state|Ancient Barangays]] headed by their own [[Datu]]s and was under the influence if not directly under the alliance network of the [[Lakan]] of Tondo.

===Spanish Colonial Period (1565-1896)===
On July 28, 1571, a month after the Spanish conquest of Manila, [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]] distributed certain parts of Luzon to the members of his expedition who assisted them in securing the Philippines for the King of Spain. Among those given were settlements near Laguna de Bay, with Gaspar Ramirez received 16 villages, with 14 of which located near the river of Calamba, while Francisco de Herrera received four other villages near the lake. Martin Gutierrez and Alonzo Ligero received five villages each, Pedro de Herrera received six villages, including the Indios of the Siniloan River, and Lope Garcia de Herrera received four villages.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blair |first1=Emma |last2=Robertson |first2=James Alexander |title=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803 (Volume 34) |date=1906 |publisher=Arthur H.

One member of Legazpi's expedition, the Portuguese-born Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, also received vast land grants from the King of Spain in recognition of his efforts to conquer the Philippines for Spain. Recognizing that he may die on his upcoming military expedition in Mindanao, he wrote down his last will in [[Arevalo, Iloilo]], where he donated the funds that established the Jesuit-run Colegio de Manila, and naming his wife and daughter as heirs. He likewise wrote that if they die without direct heirs, the Jesuits would use their inheritance for a college.<ref name="Bernad">{{cite journal |last1=Bernad |first1=Miguel |title=The Colegio de San Jose 1601-2001: The Turbulent 400-year History of an Educational Institution |journal=Landas |date=2001 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=122 |url=https://journals.ateneo.edu/index.php/landas/article/download/929/958 |access-date=February 22, 2024}}</ref> Rodriguez died in 1595, and after almost a decade, in 1604, his daughter perished when the galleon ''San Antonio'' sank en route to Mexico.<ref name="delacosta revised">{{cite book |last1=de la Costa |first1=Horacio |title=Jesuits in the Philippines: 1581-1768 |date=1961 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Boston, MA |url=https://archive.org/details/jesuitsinphilipp0000dela/page/710/mode/1up}}</ref> Upon their demise, the endowment of Rodriguez was subsequently applied to Colegio de San Jose (now San Jose Seminary), established three years earlier, in 1601.<ref name="Bernad" /> 

Around 1629, the Colegio de San Jose acquired from the Colegio de Manila parcels of land on the southwestern shore of the Laguna de Bay, near the present-day City of Biñan. Years later, in 1634, they also purchased parcels of land within the area owned by the widow of Sergeant Pedro Dominguez Franco. They merged these acquisitions to form the Hacienda San Pedro de Tunasan. However, in November 1639, the Chinese who were working against their will in the neighboring Calamba estate revolted, with the sugarcane fields of the Hacienda Tunasan destroyed in the process.<ref name="delacosta revised"/> In 1698, Tabuco, together with Biñan and San Pedro Tunasan, underwent pastoral visitation by Manila Archbishop [[Diego Camacho y Ávila|Diego Camacho]]. In the said inspection, Camacho observed that the parishones are not knowledgable of the Christian faith, prompting him and his assistant Fr. Juan Melendrez to meet the residents individually and test them on their knowledge on the basic Christian (i.e. Catholic) doctrines. Afterwards, he commanded the priests-in-charge of the area, Rev. Frs. Manuel de Leon ([[Cabuyao|Tabuco]]), Nicolas Godiño ([[Biñan]]), and Jesuit Miguel de Salas (San Pedro Tunasan) to instruct their people on the fundamental Christian doctrines. Camacho likewise ordered that the priests and their successors should not to oblige their parishoners to offer anything for the administration of the sacrament of penance, with major excommunication as penalty for non-compliance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blair |first1=Emma |last2=Robertson |first2=James Alexander |title=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803 (Volume 42) |date=1906 |publisher=Arthur H.

It is claimed that San Pedro de Tunasán became a town on January 18, 1725, upon the request of a group of San Pedrense [[Principalía]] led by Alonzo Magtibay, Francisco Santiago, and Ignacio de Guevarra and subsequently approved by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] [[Francisco de la Cuesta]]. King [[Philip V of Spain]] was said to have decreed that the town be separated from Tabuco. Francisco Santiago subsequently became the first mayor of the newly formed town.<ref>{{cite book |last1=City Government of San Pedro |title=The City of San Pedro: Anchored in Tradition, Focused on the Future |date=2021 |publisher=Erehwon Artworld Corporation}}</ref> However, another author, Agustin de la Cavada wrote that San Pedro Tunasan became a town in 1712.<ref name="cavada">{{cite book |last1=de la Cavada y Mendez de Vigo |first1=Agustin |title=Historia Geografica, Geologica, y Estadistica de Filipinas |date=1876 |publisher=Imprenta de Ramirez y Giraudier |location=Manila |url=https://archive.org/details/philippineisland42blai/page/46/mode/2up?view=theater}}</ref> 

Agriculture, especially livestock raising, farming, and fishing, during that period, was its residents' primary income source.<ref name="donanastacio">{{cite book |last1=Olivares |first1=Anastacio |title=Kasaysayan ng Bayang San Pedro Tunasan, 1574-1961 |date=1963 |publisher=Liberty Press Co. |location=Manila}}</ref><ref name="RosalesOrdoña"/> Manuel Buzeta and Felipe Bravo described the town in 1851 as having 613 houses, with a town hall and jail, and a primary school that caters to the young learners. Its parish was constructed using mixed materials and managed by a native secular priest. The crops that are said to be grown by the residents at this time were rice, sugar cane, corn, coconuts, mangoes, and other fruits and vegetables.<ref name="BuzetaBravo">{{cite book |last1=Buzeta |first1=Manuel |last2=Bravo |first2=Felipe |title=Diccionario Geografico-Estadistico-Historico de las Islas Filipinas |date=1851 |publisher=Imprenta de D.

Initially successful, the farmers eventually abandoned it, with the Spaniards blaming what they perceived as laziness of the Filipinos.<ref name="Zuniga">{{cite book |last1=Martinez de Zuñiga |first1=Joaquin |editor1-last=Retana |editor1-first=Wenceslao |title=Estadismo de las islas Filipinas |date=1893 |location=Madrid |url=https://ustdigitallibrary.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/arclibros/id/1415}}</ref> Despite this, San Pedro Tunasan was among the towns that frequently experience banditry and cattle-rustling, leading to the reputation that the town itself is not safe. 

=== The Revolutionary Struggle (1896-98) ===
During the early months of the revolution, siblings Antonino and Jose Guevara led the residents of San Pedro Tunasan in joining the nationalist cause. Due to its proximity to [[Cavite]] and to the Manila area, the local residents were advised by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] to discreetly sympathize with the revolutionaries as not to compromise the role of San Pedro as a rearguard of the revolutionary struggle.

San Pedro eventually became under the command of Katipunero General [[Paciano Rizal]], brother of Jose.

===First Republic and the Philippine-American War (1898-1901)===

San Pedro was among the towns controlled by Filipino forces when the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] was promulgated on June 12, 1898. As a result, its presidente municipal, Gregorio Alvarez was among those who participated in the Bacoor Assembly of August 1, 1898. In this meeting held at Bacoor's Cuenca Mansion, about 200 municipal presidents ratified the Philippine Declaration of Independence.<ref name="antoninoguevara" /><ref name="boncocandiestro" /> Months later, on December 30, 1898, San Pedro was among the towns who commemorated the first Rizal Day in accordance with the decree issued by President Aguinaldo. The Parish Priest of the San Pedro Apostol Parish, Fr. Victor Enrile, presided a [[Requiem Mass]] in honor of Dr. [[Jose Rizal]] inside the church, which was followed by a program where patriotic residents praised Rizal and rebuked the Americans due to the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]].<ref name="donanastacio" />

When the Philippine-American War broke out, San Pedro Tunasan initially served as one of the rearguards for the forces of the First Philippine Republic. Some residents even formed a militia that joined the fight against the Americans.<ref name="donanastacio"/> However, on January 6, 1900, during their military expedition of Brigadier General [[Theodore Schwan]], the Americans entered San Pedro Tunasan without any resistance.<ref name="annualreportswardept1900vol3">{{cite book |last1=United States War Department |title=Annual Reports of the War Department for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1900 (volume 3) |date=1900 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, DC |url=http://archive.org/details/annualreportswa83deptgoog.}}</ref> Some residents who were suspected of sympathizing with the First Philippine Republic were arrested by the Americans and severely tortured.<ref name="einolf">{{cite book |last1=Einolf |first1=Christopher |title=America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal |date=2014 |publisher=Palgrave McMillan}}</ref> When President Aguinaldo ordered the Filipino forces to shift to guerrilla warfare, the politico-military governor of Laguna, General [[Juan Cailles]] placed San Pedro, together with Biñan, Santa Rosa, Cabuyao, and Calamba under the leadership of Colonel Severino Taiño. When Taiño was killed somewhere between San Pedro and Biñan, he was replaced by Colonel Julio Infante.<ref name="boncocandiestro" /> 

After the surrender of the First Republic in March 1901, General [[Miguel Malvar]] made San Pedro Tunasan part of his guerrilla area of operations, prompting the Americans to subject the town to hamletting tactics to force the remaining Filipino guerrillas to surrender. Later, Filipino resistance forces led by General [[Macario Sakay]] operated in San Pedro until his execution in 1907.<ref name="ileto">{{cite book |last1=Ileto |first1=Reynaldo |title=Pasyon and Revolution: Popular Movements in the Philippines, 1840-1910 |date=1979 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |location=Quezon City}}</ref> 

===American Colonial Period (1898-1946)===
Once the Americans seized control of San Pedro on January 6, 1900, they appointed Benito Almendrala as Municipal President, and Arcadio Morando as Chief of Police. A year later, Toribio Almeida became the first elected Municipal President of San Pedro.<ref name="donanastacio" /> As an austerity measure of the American Colonial Government, in 1903, by virtue of Act No. 939, San Pedro Tunasan’s township status was dissolved becoming part of the then town of Biñan.<ref name="ActNo939">{{cite book |last1=Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department |title=Laws of United States Philippine Commission (Acts Nos. 425-949, inclusive) |date=1904 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, DC |page=772}}</ref> In the same year, Muntinlupa was joined to the aforementioned under Act No. 1008.<ref name="ActNo1008">{{cite web |title=Act No. 1008 |url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l5910 |website=Lawyerly.Ph}}</ref> The local residents requested the Insular Government to reinstate San Pedro as a town, which succeeded upon the enactment of Act No. 1553 in 1906.<ref name="ActNo1553">{{cite book |last1=United States War Department |title=Acts of the Philippine Commission, nos. 1539-1800 inclusive |date=1907 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, DC |page=22}}</ref> Pascual Mindo became the municipal president of the revived Municipality of San Pedro Tunasan in 1907.<ref>{{cite news |title=Municipio ng Sampiro Tunasan: Halal na Pamunuang-bayan |url=https://gpa.eastview.com/crl/sea/newspapers/renx19061212-01.1.2 |publisher=Muling Pagsilang |date=December 12, 1906 |page=2}}</ref> It was also around this time that the Hacienda San Pedro de Tunasan was reverted to Jesuit control, following the orders of the Holy See that the Colegio de San Jose, together with the Hacienda Tunasan be returned by the Dominican friars to the Jesuit fathers.<ref name="Bernad" /> Eventually, an American businessman, Carlos Young, leased the Hacienda from the Jesuits.<ref name="donanastacio" />

Despite the town’s development under the Americans, San Pedro also experienced conflicts and upheavals during the American Period. This period saw the tense agrarian conflict between the local residents and the administration of the Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan. Young, as the lessor of the Hacienda, was alleged to impose rent hikes to the point that the tenants were not able to pay it. This resulted to the expulsion of some tenants and demolition of their houses in the hacienda property.<ref name="donanastacio" /> The residents, asserting their right to the Hacienda lands that they cultivate, organized various agrarian movements in San Pedro, such as the Katipunang Laban sa Hacienda (KALASAHA), the JAMAT, and Samahang Oras Na.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña"/> The conflict swung to a violent turn when in 1935, a demolition attempt by the Hacienda administration in Barangay Cuyab resulted in a riot that resulted to the death of a young resident, Generoso "Ka Osong" Garcia. This prompted the [[Philippine Constabulary]] to deploy troops in San Pedro Tunasan in order to restore peace and order.<ref>{{cite news |title=One Killed as Tunasan Tenants Riot |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/249679841?searchTerm=One%20Killed%20as%20Tunasan%20Tenants%20Riot |issue=Year X, No. 309 |work=The Tribune |date=March 28, 1935 |location=National Library of Australia |pages=1}}</ref> While the conflict was ongoing, the town also witnessed the peasant-led Sakdal Uprising in the mid-1930s, with reports indicate that an attack by Sakdalistas in San Pedro was averted by the Constabulary.<ref>{{cite news |title=57 Killed as Riots Subside |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/249681095 |issue=38 |work=The Tribune |date=May 4, 1935 |location=National Library of Australia}}</ref> 

With these issues at hand, the Commonwealth government under President [[Manuel Quezon]] were compelled to resolve the conflict as soon as possible. In 1936, the National Assembly passed Commonwealth Act No. 20, which authorized President Quezon to initiate expropriation proceedings or negotiate for the acquisition of landed estates and sell them to qualified individuals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commonwealth Act No. 20 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1936/07/11/commonwealth-act-no-20/ |website=Official Gazette of the Philippines |date=July 11, 1936}}</ref> President Quezon even invited the leaders of Samahang Oras Na and San Pedro municipal officials led by Mayor Ciriaco Limpiahoy to personally witness the signing of the said law. Three years later, the Commonwealth acquired the {{convert|215|ha}} of the Hacienda, and through the Rural Progress Administration, planned to sell it to the residents. This led to the division of the Samahang Oras Na to two factions: those who favored the government's solution, composed of the local intelligentsia and town elites, were called as "No Parking," while the San Pedrense masses who were advised by Atty. Juan Rustia and opposed the government's plan out of belief that the lands of the Hacienda should be automatically be owned by them were called as the "Yapak." This difference in beliefs led to tense relations between the two groups, with the Yapak members refusing to interact nor do business with the No Parking members.<ref name="donanastacio" /> The refusal of the Yapaks to recognize the ownership of the Colegio de San Jose to the Hacienda lands forced the government to sell their lands to other interested individuals. The municipal officials, led by Mayor Benedicto Austria, sided with the Yapak, prompting Quezon to suspend him and the Municipal Council in 1941, and replace them with a new set of municipal officials led by Jose L. Amante.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña" />

===World War II and Japanese Occupation (1941-1945)===
During World War II, the Japanese entered San Pedro on January 1, 1942 and conquered the town for the next three years. San Pedro was among the routes used by the Imperial Japanese Army forces to reach Manila and occupy the national capital.<ref name="morton">{{cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Louis |title=The Fall of the Philippines |date=1953 |publisher=US Army Center of Military History |location=Washington, DC |url=https://history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_Contents.htm}}</ref> 

Out of fear from the advancing Japanese forces, the municipal officials at that time hurriedly evacuated to other towns, leaving their townmates behind. The Japanese then ordered the residents to elect their local officials, with former mayor Ciriaco Limpiajoy winning the polls. Despite this, the town was virtually controlled by a Japanese resident, Fujiwara Itizi, who acted as interpreter for the Japanese forces.<ref name="donanastacio" /> During the Occupation, there were incidents of atrocities that occurred in the town, among them was a zonification ("sona") inflicted by the Japanese against the male residents in July 1944. In this event, the Japanese announced that the male residents, who were members of the Japanese-organized "bamboo army," would have a practice drill in the town plaza. Instead they were arrested and locked inside the San Pedro Apostol Parish for three days.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña">{{cite book |last1=Rosales |first1=Amalia |last2=Ordoña |first2=Sonny |title=San Pedro: Noon at Ngayon |date=2007 |publisher=San Pedro Historical Committee |location=Manila}}</ref>

Some residents of San Pedro joined the guerilla movement and commanded units in Laguna. Among the guerrilla units who operated in San Pedro are the Fil-American Irregular Troops (FAIT) led by Capt. Felipe Alviar,<ref name="FAIT">{{cite web |title=3rd Inf Regt, McKinley Div, Fil-American Irregular Troops (FAIT) |url=https://collections.pvao.mil.ph/Guerilla/GuerillaInformationDownload/GUA-0001064 |website=RG 407 The Philippine Archives Collection |publisher=Philippine Veterans Affairs Office}}</ref> and a branch of the Blue Lake Battalion, Hunters ROTC Guerrillas led by Lieutenant Antonio Partoza.<ref name="48thRegt47thDivHunters">{{cite web |title=48th Regt, 47th Div Hunter's-Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) |url=https://collections.pvao.mil.ph/Guerilla/GuerillaInformationDownload/GUA-0001178 |website=RG 407 The Philippine Archives Collection |publisher=Philippine Veterans Affairs Office}}</ref> One of the local residents, Abelardo Remoquillo, became a Hunters ROTC guerrilla commander in Eastern Laguna, and died during the liberation campaigns in Bay, Laguna on March 8, 1945.

Partoza, a lawyer by profession, was appointed by the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) as military mayor of San Pedro.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña" />

===Post-War and Martial Law Period (1946-1986)===

The post-war years saw the prominence of San Pedro's [[sampaguita]] industry, with it becoming the country’s leading producer of Sampaguita buds. However, the conflict over the lands of the Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan resumed once the war had ended. Because of their sheer numbers, the Yapaks continued to dominate the municipal leadership in the years after the war. They filed several cases against the Colegio de San Jose in the Court of First Instance, but these cases were eventually dismissed by the court. Their assertions continued despite the five-year suspension imposed by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] against Rustia, and his subsequent death in 1951. In 1948, the Hacienda's administrator, N.V. Sinclair, gradually sold the remaining Hacienda lands to other individuals, even to non-San Pedrenses.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña" /> 

This forced the Yapaks, who were already called then as the Anak ng Bayan, to sought the help of the newly-elected President [[Ramon Magsaysay]]. Magsaysay advised them to follow the court's decision, while at the same time ordering the government to investigate the case of Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan. Eventually, the Magsaysay administration decided to acquire the remaining 850 hectares of the Hacienda. On August 30, 1954, President Magsaysay visited San Pedro and witnessed at the town plaza the sale of the Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan to the government. He likewise signed there the Agricultural Tenancy Act (Republic Act No. 1199), which codified the different tenancy laws in the Philippines.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña" />  The farm lots of the hacienda were bought by the Philippine government to be sold at cost to the tenants or occupants of the farm lots in Bayan-Bayanan under the Narra Settlement Project of the Magsaysay Administration.<ref>{{cite book |last1=City Government of San Pedro |title=The City of San Pedro: Anchored in Tradition, Focused on the Future |date=2021 |publisher=Erehwon Artworld Corporation}}</ref> These resettlement areas are the present-day barangays Magsaysay, Riverside, United Bayanihan, United Better Living, Estrella, Langgam, Laram, and Bagong Silang.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña"/> 

[[File:PNR Carmona Line inauguration.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of the Philippine National Railways' Carmona Line on April 1, 1971. From the Times Journal, derived by Mr. Gorio Belen]]

San Pedro likewise benefited from the postwar commercialization and industrialization boom of Mega Manila as some companies and real estate developers established their factories and subdivisions within the town.<ref>{{cite book |last1=City Government of San Pedro |title=The City of San Pedro: Anchored in Tradition, Focused on the Future |date=2021 |publisher=Erehwon Artworld Corporation}}</ref> The 1960s saw the gradual emergence of industrial estates and subdivisions in San Pedro. Among those who made San Pedro as their base of operations are Holland Milk Products Inc. (now Alaska Milk Corporation), Cosmos Bottling Corporation, ACLEM Paper Mills, Kimberly-Clark Philippines, Philippine Tobacco Flu Curing Corporation, Berbacs Chemicals, US Tobacco Corporation, and Trinity Lodge Mining Corporation.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña"/> It was also in the 1960s when the Holiday Hills Golf Club (now Filipinas Golf Hallow Ridge) was built in Barangay San Antonio.<ref>{{cite book |last1=City Government of San Pedro |title=The City of San Pedro: Anchored in Tradition, Focused on the Future |date=2021 |publisher=Erehwon Artworld Corporation}}</ref> Between 1964 and 1971, the National Government commenced the San Pedro Resettlement Project, with parcels of land that was part of the 850-hectare acquisition made in 1954 by President Magsaysay distributed to landless San Pedrenses and other settlers.<ref name="RosalesOrdoña"/> To further boost the urbanization of San Pedro, in 1973, the Carmona Line of the [[Philippine National Railways]] was inaugurated. It was a spur line from San Pedro going to Carmona, Cavite (now [[General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite]]), passing thru Pacita Complex. In 1978, under Presidential Decree No. 1474, the [[Department of Agrarian Reform]] was ordered to convert the San Pedro Tunasan Estate to a commercial, industrial, and residential site, and transfer it afterwards to the National Housing Authority.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 1474, s. 1978 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1978/06/11/presidential-decree-no-1474-s-1978/ |website=Official Gazette of the Philippines}}</ref> These chain of events occurred under the administrations of Mayors Mario Brigola (1960-1963), Jose L.

===Contemporary History (1986-present)===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Following the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]], President [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed the local leader of the anti-dictatorship movement, [[Calixto Cataquiz]], as OIC-Mayor of San Pedro. Known as "Calex," it was during his administration that San Pedro's annual income increased, leading it to achieve the status as a first-class municipality in 1992. It was during his administration that the iconic San Pedro Welcome Arch was built, as well as the Jose L. Amante Emergency Hospital and the Gavino Alvarez Lying-in Clinic. In 1998, former mayor Vierneza was re-elected, thereby continuing the progress that was started by Mayor Calex, as manifested by the further establishment of subdivisions, business establishments, and the opening of the San Pedro Exit of the [[South Luzon Expressway]].

On March 27, 2013, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] signed the Republic Act No. 10420,<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=10420|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2013/03/27/republic-act-no-10420/|title=An Act Converting the Municipality of San Pedro in the Province of Laguna into a Component City to be Known as the City of San Pedro|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|date=March 27, 2013}}</ref> converting the municipality into a new component city of the province of Laguna. The cityhood of San Pedro was ratified through a plebiscite scheduled by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)]] (COMELEC) on December 28, 2013, after the National Barangay Elections. With 16,996 "yes" votes over 869 "no" votes and an 11% turnout, it was proclaimed the sixth city of Laguna on December 29, 2013, after the cities of [[Biñan]], [[Cabuyao]], [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]], and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], and also the third to be a city in the 1st congressional district of Laguna - making it the first city district in the province.

Once it achieved its cityhood status, there had been proposals to make San Pedro part of the National Capital Region. [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority|Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA)]] [[Chairperson of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority|Chairman]] [[Francis Tolentino]] pushed for the inclusion of the city in the National Capital Region, and eventually become its 18th member city. Tolentino said that in the first meeting of the MMDA Council of mayors in January 2015, he would push for the inclusion of the city to the MMDA.<ref name=MB>{{Cite news|work=Manila Bulletin|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/san-pedro-city-eyed-as-18th-member-of-mmda/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231114421/http://www.mb.com.ph/san-pedro-city-eyed-as-18th-member-of-mmda/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 31, 2014|title=San Pedro City eyed as 18th member of MMDA|date=December 31, 2014|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref>

In 2015, due to its large population, San Pedro's Barangay San Vicente was split to eight barangays, namely: San Vicente, Pacita I, Pacita II, Chrysanthemum, Rosario, Fatima, San Lorenzo Ruiz, and Maharlika. This increased the number of San Pedro's barangays to 27. This was approved by the local population through a plebiscite.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seven New Barangays Established In the 3rd Quarter of 2015 |url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/seven-new-barangays-established-3rd-quarter-2015 |publisher=Philippine Statistics Authority}}</ref> This was further reinforced when President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed Republic Act No. 11295 in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 11295 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2019/04/17/republic-act-no-11295/ |publisher=Official Gazette of the Philippines}}</ref> In the same year, Senator [[Koko Pimentel|Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III]] sought the separation of the city of San Pedro from the [[Laguna's 1st congressional district|first legislative district of Laguna]] province to constitute a lone congressional district. In 2015, he filed [http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=16&q=SBN-3029 Senate Bill No. 3029] for the creation of the San Pedro as a separate district to commence in the next national and local elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2016/0104_pimentel1.asp|title=Press Release - Koko seeks the creation of San Pedro City as a separate congressional district|website=www.senate.gov.ph. Senate of the Philippines|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref> After the city of Santa Rosa formally gained [[Santa Rosa's at-large congressional district|its own representation]] effective 2022, San Pedro remained as the only local government unit in the first district. Hence, the 1st District may be also referred as the Lone District of San Pedro.

==Geography==
San Pedro is located in Region IV-A or [[Calabarzon]]. San Pedro is the boundary between Laguna and Metro Manila, so San Pedro is known as "Laguna's Gateway to [[Metro Manila]]". San Pedro shares boundaries with Metro Manila's southernmost city, [[Muntinlupa]] (North) bounded by [[Tunasan River]], [[Biñan]] (south), [[Dasmariñas]] (west), [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]] and [[General Mariano Alvarez]] (Southwest) bound with San Isidro River. Its position makes San Pedro a popular suburban residential community, where many residents commute daily to Metro Manila for work.<ref name="History"/>

San Pedro is {{convert|58|km}} from [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] and {{convert|29|km}} from [[Manila]].

===Notable Heritage Structures and Cultural Properties===

====Lolo Uweng Image====
[[File:6545Landayan, San Pedro City, Laguna 09.jpg|thumb|Image of "Lolo Uweng" at the Diocesan Shrine of the Holy Sepulchre]]
Enshrined in Barangay Landayan's Diocesan Shrine of the Holy Sepulchre, this image of the dead [[Jesus Christ]] was formally known in the Philippines as the ''Santo Sepulcro''. The locals refer to it as ''Lolo Uweng'', after the image's formal title, ''Emmanuel Salvador del Mundo''. It is claimed that the image was found floating in Laguna de Bay by the locals, and once retrieved, was placed in the then-Barrio Landayan Chapel. It is approximated that Barangay Landayan's devotion to Lolo Uweng started on or before 1836, based on the inscriptions found at the church's old bell.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://lolouwengshrine.com/history |website=Lolo Uweng Shrine |publisher=Diocesan Shrine of the Holy Sepulchre}}</ref> 

Said to be miraculous, the image is frequently visited by several pilgrims, especially during Fridays. It is also one of the known pilgrimage areas in San Pedro during Holy Week. Numerous stories of its alleged miracles were also published by the Shrine in different books.

====Lolo Uweng's Well====
Located a few meters away from the Diocesan Shrine of the Holy Sepulchre, this well was said to be built on or before 1917, based on the inscriptions found underneath the cistern. It is believed that the water from this well is miraculous, making it also a tourist destination in Barangay Landayan.

====Krus ng San Pedro Tunasan====
Enshrined inside the San Pedro Apostol Parish, the Krus ng San Pedro Tunasan is one of the most renowned cultural properties in the City of San Pedro. It is also known for its alleged miraculous attributes, and was among the known devotional practices done during the Spanish Colonial Period. Proof of its popularity during the Spanish period was its inclusion in Jose Rizal's ''[[Noli me Tangere]]''. In Chapter 42, Capitan Tiago ordered Tia Isabel to give donations to this Cross and to the Krus ng Matahong in Malabon for Maria Clara's speedy recovery from illness.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Holy Crosses of Tunasan and Matahong - The Crosses in Rizal's "Noli Me Tangere" |url=https://pintakasi1521.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-holy-crosses-of-tunasan-and.html |website=Pintakasi |date=March 7, 2017}}</ref>
