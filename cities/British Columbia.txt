==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of British Columbia}}
[[File:BC Elevation.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|British Columbia's [[geography]] is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief, which has defined patterns of [[Human settlement|settlement]] and industry since colonization.]]
British Columbia is bordered to the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the American state of [[Alaska]], to the north by [[Yukon]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], to the east by the province of [[Alberta]], and to the south by the American states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]]. The [[Canada–United States border|southern border of British Columbia]] was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as [[California]]. British Columbia's land area is {{convert|944735|km2|-2}}. [[British Columbia Coast|British Columbia's rugged coastline]] stretches for more than {{convert|27000|km}}, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited. It is the only province in Canada that borders the Pacific Ocean. British Columbia's highest mountain is [[Mount Fairweather]]; the highest mountain entirely within the province is [[Mount Waddington]].

British Columbia's capital is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], located at the southeastern tip of [[Vancouver Island]]. Only a narrow strip of Vancouver Island, from [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] to Victoria, is significantly populated. Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by [[temperate rainforest]].

The province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is at the confluence of the [[Fraser River]] and [[Georgia Strait]], in the mainland's southwest corner (an area often called the [[Lower Mainland]]). By land area, [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] is the largest city. [[Vanderhoof, British Columbia|Vanderhoof]] is near the geographic centre of the province.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vanderhoof |url=http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709215521/http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm |archive-date=July 9, 2011 |access-date=April 26, 2007 |publisher=[[Tourism BC]]}}</ref>
[[File:Bcmap.png|alt=Outline map of British Columbia with significant cities and towns.|left|thumb|Outline map of British Columbia with significant cities and towns]]
The [[Coast Mountains]] and the [[Inside Passage]]'s many [[fjord|inlets]] provide some of British Columbia's renowned and spectacular scenery, which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and [[ecotourism]] industry. 75 percent of the province is mountainous (more than {{cvt|1000|m|disp=sqbr}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]); 60 percent is forested; and only about 5 percent is arable.

The province's mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the Pacific Ocean. Terrain ranges from dry inland forests and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] valleys, to the range and canyon districts of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central and Southern Interior]], to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the Northern Interior. High mountain regions both north and south have [[Subalpine zone|subalpine flora]]<ref name="Subalpine">{{cite web |url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/Bro/bro55.pdf |title=The Ecology of the Engelmann Spruce – Subalpine Fir Zone |publisher=B.C.

The [[Okanagan Valley (wine region)|Okanagan wine area]], extending from [[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]] to [[Osoyoos]] at the United States border, is one of several wine and [[cider]]-producing regions in Canada. Other wine regions in British Columbia include the [[Cowichan Valley]] on Vancouver Island and the [[Fraser Valley]].

The Southern Interior cities of [[Kamloops]] and [[Penticton]] have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada (while higher elevations are cold and snowy), although their temperatures are often exceeded north of the [[Fraser Canyon]], close to the confluence of the Fraser and [[Thompson River|Thompson]] rivers, where the terrain is rugged and covered with desert-type flora. Semi-desert grassland is found in large areas of the [[Interior Plateau]], with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones.

The northern, mostly mountainous, two-thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped, except for the area east of the [[Canadian Rockies|Rockies]], where the [[Peace River Country]] contains BC's portion of the [[Canadian Prairies]], centred at the city of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]].

British Columbia is considered part of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Cascadia (bioregion)|Cascadia bioregion]], along with the [[U.S. state|American states]] of Alaska, Idaho, (western) Montana, [[Oregon]], Washington, and [[Northern California|(northern) California]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |title=Pacific Northwest Washington Oregon British Columbia |publisher=Celebratebig.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222031254/http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |access-date=January 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cooltrails.com/ |title=Northwest Hiking Trails: Washington, Oregon, Idaho |publisher=Cooltrails.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119222550/http://www.cooltrails.com/ |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |access-date=January 24, 2012}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:British Columbia Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in British Columbia]]
[[File:Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|The [[Strait of Georgia]], near [[Vancouver]]]]
Because of the many mountain ranges and rugged coastline, British Columbia's climate varies dramatically across the province.

Coastal southern British Columbia has a mild and rainy climate influenced by the [[North Pacific Current]]. Most of the region is classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]], though pockets of [[Warm-summer Mediterranean|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] also exist in the far-southern parts of the coast. Precipitation averages above {{cvt|1000|mm|in}} in almost all of the coastal region, and [[Hucuktlis Lake]] on [[Vancouver Island]] receives an average of {{cvt|6,903|mm|in}} of rain annually.

Due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges, the climate of some of the interior valleys of the province (such as the Thompson, parts of the Fraser Canyon, the southern Cariboo and parts of the Okanagan) is [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] with certain locations receiving less than {{convert|250|mm|0}} in annual precipitation. The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to {{convert|12|C}}, the mildest anywhere in Canada.

The valleys of the Southern Interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow, while those in the [[Cariboo]], in the [[British Columbia Interior#Central Interior|Central Interior]], are colder because of increased altitude and latitude, but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in Canada. Outside of the driest valleys, the Southern and Central Interior generally have a [[humid continental climate]] with widely variable precipitation. For example, the average daily low in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (roughly in the middle of the province) in January is {{convert|-12|C}}.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 31, 2011 |title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981–2010 Station Data |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=631&lang=e&StationName=Prince+George&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208115244/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=631&lang=e&StationName=Prince+George&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1 |archive-date=December 8, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2015 |publisher=[[Environment and Climate Change Canada]]}}</ref> Small towns in the southern interior with high elevation such as [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]] are typically colder and snowier than cities in the valleys.<ref name="Princeton">{{cite web |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=princeton&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=1056&dispBack=1 |title=Princeton A |date=September 25, 2013 |website=Canadian Climate Normals 1981–2010 |publisher=[[Environment Canada]] |access-date=January 15, 2018 |archive-date=January 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190116200713/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=princeton&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=1056&dispBack=1 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central British Columbia.

Winters are generally severe in the Northern Interior which is generally in the [[subarctic climate]] zone, but even there, milder air can penetrate far inland. The coldest temperature in British Columbia was recorded in [[Smith River, British Columbia|Smith River]], where it dropped to {{convert|-58.9|C}} on January 31, 1947,<ref name="KCH-WD2-2002">{{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2002/alm02feb.htm |title=North America's Record Cold |last=Heidorn |first=Keith C. |year=2002 |publisher=The Weather Doctor Almanac |access-date=July 14, 2012 |archive-date=July 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721011243/http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2002/alm02feb.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in North America. [[Atlin, British Columbia|Atlin]] in the province's far northwest, along with the adjoining Southern Lakes region of [[Yukon]], get midwinter thaws caused by the [[Chinook (wind)|Chinook]] effect, which is also common (and much warmer) in more southerly parts of the Interior.

During winter on the coast, [[rainfall]], sometimes relentless heavy rain, dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic low-pressure systems from the North Pacific. Average snowfall on the coast during a normal winter is between {{convert|25|and|50|cm|0}}, but on occasion (and not every winter) heavy snowfalls with more than {{convert|20|cm|0}} and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas, typically for short periods, and can take temperatures below {{convert|-10|C}}, even at sea level. Arctic outflow winds can occasionally result in wind chill temperatures at or even below {{convert|-17.8|C}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} While winters are very wet, coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anti-cyclonic high pressure.

Southern Interior valleys are hot in summer; for example, in [[Osoyoos]], the July maximum temperature averages {{convert|31.7|C}}, making it the hottest month of any location in Canada; this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province. Temperatures often exceed {{convert|40|C}} in the lower elevations of valleys in the Interior during mid-summer, with the record high of {{convert|49.6|C}} being held in [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]] on June 29, 2021, during [[2021 Western North America heat wave|a record-breaking heat wave that year]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Uguen-Csenge |first1=Eva |last2=Lindsay |first2=Bethany |date=June 29, 2021 |title=For 3rd straight day, B.C. village smashes record for highest Canadian temperature at 49.6 C |work=[[CBC News]] |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-alberta-heat-wave-heat-dome-temperature-records-1.6084203 |url-status=live |access-date=June 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210801154046/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-alberta-heat-wave-heat-dome-temperature-records-1.6084203 |archive-date=August 1, 2021}}</ref>

[[File:Vineyards Lake Okanagan.jpg|thumb|The [[Okanagan]] region has a climate suitable for vineyards.]]
The extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires, from dry-lightning or man-made causes. Many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months, in contrast to abundant summer sunshine. Annual sunshine hours vary from 2200 near Cranbrook and Victoria to less than 1300 in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], on the [[British Columbia Coast#North Coast|North Coast]] just south of [[Southeast Alaska]].

The exception to British Columbia's wet and cloudy winters is during the [[El Niño]] phase. During El Niño events, the jet stream is much farther south across North America, making the province's winters milder and drier than normal. Winters are much wetter and cooler during the opposite phase, [[La Niña]].

There are 14 designations of parks and protected areas in the province that reflect the different administration and creation of these areas in a modern context. There are 141 ecological reserves, 35 provincial marine parks, 7 provincial heritage sites, 6 [[National Historic Sites of Canada]], 4 [[national park]]s and 3 national park reserves. 12.5 percent of the province's area ({{convert|114000|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is considered protected under one of the 14 different designations that includes over 800 distinct areas.

British Columbia contains seven of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's national parks]] and National Park Reserves:

* [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]]
* [[Gulf Islands National Park Reserve]]
* [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site]]
* [[Kootenay National Park]]
* [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]]
* [[Pacific Rim National Park Reserve]]
* [[Yoho National Park]]

British Columbia contains a large number of [[provincial park]]s, run by BC Parks under the aegis of the Ministry of Environment. British Columbia's provincial parks system is the second largest parks system in Canada, the largest being Canada's National Parks system.

Another tier of parks in British Columbia are [[regional park]]s, which are maintained and run by [[List of regional districts of British Columbia|the province's regional districts]]. The Ministry of Forests operates forest recreation sites.

In addition to these areas, over {{convert|47000|km2}} of [[arable land]] are protected by the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]].

The area now known as British Columbia is home to First Nations groups that have a deep history with a significant number of indigenous languages. There are more than 200 First Nations in BC. Prior to contact (with non-Aboriginal people), human history is known from oral histories, archaeological investigations, and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period.

The arrival of Europeans began around the mid-18th century, as [[fur trade]]rs entered the area to harvest [[sea otter]]s. While it is thought [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was [[Juan José Pérez Hernández|Juan Pérez]] who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, Pérez and Quadra reasserted the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] claim for the [[Pacific coast]], first made by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] in 1513.

The explorations of [[James Cook]] in 1778 and [[George Vancouver]] in 1792 and 1793 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River. In 1793, [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of [[Dean Channel]] near [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and other explorers—notably [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], [[Samuel Black]], and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]—were primarily concerned with extending the [[fur trade]], rather than political considerations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}} In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the [[Nootka Convention]]s, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers, including Britain, but because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], there was little British action on its claims in the region until later.

The establishment of [[trading post]]s by the [[North West Company]] and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District was broadly defined as being south of 54°40 north latitude, (the southern limit of [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian America]]), north of Mexican-controlled California, and west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was, by the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], under the "joint occupancy and use" of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is to say, the fur companies).<ref>{{Cite web |title=BRITISH COLUMBIA |url=https://www.solarnavigator.net/geography/british_columbia.htm |access-date=2024-08-14 |website=www.solarnavigator.net}}</ref> This co-occupancy was ended with the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846.

The major supply route was the [[York Factory Express]] between [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Fort Vancouver]]. Some of the early outposts grew into settlements, communities, and cities. Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] (established 1794); [[Hudson's Hope]] (1805); [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] (1805); [[Fort St. James]] (1806); [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (1807); Kamloops (1812); [[Fort Langley]] (1827); [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] (1843); [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]] (1848); and Nanaimo (1853). Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include [[Vancouver, Washington]] ([[Fort Vancouver]]), formerly the "capital" of Hudson's Bay operations in the Columbia District, [[Colville, Washington]] and [[Walla Walla, Washington]] (old [[Fort Nez Percés]]).

[[File:Edward Gennys Fanshawe, Fort Rupert, Beaver Harbour, Vancouver's Island, July 23rd 1851 (Canada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Rupert]], Vancouver Island, 1851]]
With the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, modern-day British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] district, administered from Fort St. James. The interior south of the [[Thompson River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was attached to the much larger [[District of Athabasca|Athabasca District]], headquartered in [[Fort Chipewyan]], in present-day Alberta.

Until 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of [[British North America]] under the [[de facto]] jurisdiction of HBC administrators; however, unlike [[Rupert's Land]] to the north and east, the territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern [[Columbia River drainage basin|Columbia Basin]] (within present day Washington and [[Oregon]]). In 1846, the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the territory along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] to the [[Strait of Georgia]], with the area south of this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]]) transferred to sole American sovereignty. The [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created in 1849, with Victoria designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central Interior came to be called, continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America, "administered" by individual HBC trading post managers.

With the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial office]] to designate the mainland as the Colony of British Columbia. When news of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] reached London, Richard Clement Moody was hand-picked by the [[Colonial Office]], under [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire's "bulwark in the farthest west"<ref name="Donald J.

Moody and the Royal Engineers also built an extensive road network, including what would become [[Kingsway (Vancouver)|Kingsway]], connecting New Westminster to [[False Creek]], the North Road between [[Port Moody]] and New Westminster, and the [[Cariboo Road]] and [[Stanley Park]].<ref name="royalengineers.ca">{{cite web |url=http://www.royalengineers.ca/MoodyPostScript.html |title=Col.

As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated "government reserves", which included [[Stanley Park]] as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The ''Pre-emption Act'' did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including {{Convert|3750|acre|ha|sigfig=4|order=flip}} by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for [[land grabbing]]. Moody designed the first [[coat of arms of British Columbia]]. [[Port Moody]] is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.

By 1862, the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]]) up the [[Fraser Canyon]] to the prospecting region around [[Barkerville]]. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening [[sawmill]]s, and engaging in [[fishery|fishing]] and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of [[responsible government]] began to be vocalized, led by the influential editor of the [[New Westminster]] ''British Columbian'' and future [[Premier of British Columbia|premier]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]]. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864. Finally, the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor.

===Later gold rushes===
A series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed, the largest being the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom communities like [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] and [[Lillooet]], which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–71)|succeeded in 1866]], when the colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] to form the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–1871)]], which was, in turn, succeeded by the present day province of British Columbia following the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1871.

===Rapid growth and development (1860s to 1910s)===

Completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] was a condition of British Columbia's entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]
[[File:Craigellachie (Gedenkstein).jpg|thumb|Memorial to the "last spike" in Craigellachie]]
The Confederation League led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]). With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to British Columbia and assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] on July 20, 1871. The Treaty of Washington sent the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] San Juan Islands Border dispute to arbitration in 1871 and in 1903, the province's territory shrank again after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].

Population in British Columbia continued to expand as the [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fishery|fishing]] sectors were developed. Mining activity was notable throughout the Mainland, that a common epithet it, even after provincehood, was "the Gold Colony".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Belshaw|first=John Douglas|date=2015|chapter=13.9 The Gold Colony|chapter-url=https://opentextbc.ca/preconfederation/chapter/13-9-the-gold-colony/|title=Canadian History: Pre-Confederation|access-date=January 1, 2022|archive-date=January 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220101191944/https://opentextbc.ca/preconfederation/chapter/13-9-the-gold-colony/|url-status=live}}</ref> Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley. Cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson Rivers, the Cariboo, the [[Chilcotin Country|Chilcotin]], and the Okanagan. Forestry drew workers to the temperate rainforests of the coast, which was also the locus of a growing fishery.

The completion of the railway in 1885 contributed to the economy, facilitating the transportation of the region's considerable resources to the east. The milltown of Granville, also known as [[Gastown]] was selected as the terminus. This prompted the incorporation of the city of Vancouver in 1886. The completion of the [[Port of Vancouver]] spurred rapid growth, and in less than fifty years the city surpassed [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], as the largest in [[Western Canada]]. The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically, its settlement and development—were paramount. This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land, control over its resources, as well as the ability to trade in some resources, such as fishing.

Establishing a [[labor force|labour force]] to develop the province was problematic, and British Columbia was a destination of immigration from Europe, China, Japan and India. The influx of a non-[[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups, resulting in agitation and an attempt to restrict the ability of [[Asian people]] to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of the [[Chinese head tax]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chan |first1=Arlene |title=Chinese Head Tax in Canada |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chinese-head-tax-in-canada |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |access-date=4 June 2024}}</ref> This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907.

===20th century===
{{Further|Canada in World War II}}
In World War I, the province responded strongly to the call to assist the British Empire against its German foes in French and Belgian battlefields. About 55,570 of the province's 400,000 residents, the highest per-capita rate in Canada, responded to the military's need. About 6,225 men from the province died in combat.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Dickson |first1=Greg |last2=Forsythe |first2=Mark |date=Summer 2015 |title=From the West Coast to the Western Front: British Columbians and the Great War |magazine=British Columbia History magazine |volume=48 |issue=2}}</ref>

In 1914, a second transcontinental rail line, the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk Pacific]], was completed. This opened up the North Coast and [[Bulkley Valley]] region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur-trading and subsistence economy soon became an area for forestry, farming, and mining. This sector attracted workers from Asia and Europe, leading to a diverse but conflict-ridden society. The early 20th century saw significant interaction between immigrants, [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]], and economic forces. There was a rise in the labour movement, marked by strikes and conflicts such as the [[Battle of Ballantyne Pier|1935 docker's strike at Ballantyne Pier]] and the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]]. These events underscored tensions between workers and big business, often mediated by the Communist Party. Racial and ethnic relations were strained, with legislation reflecting the era's racial prejudices, notably against Asian immigrants and First Nations. The early and mid-20th century was marred by incidents like the [[Komagata Maru incident]], highlighting anti-Asian sentiment.

The interwar period and World War II introduced significant changes, including [[prohibition]] and its eventual repeal, and the [[internment of Japanese Canadians]]. The post-war era saw coalition governments and a booming economy, spearheaded by infrastructure projects and industrial expansion. The [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]], under [[W.A.C. Bennett]], dominated BC politics, initiating major projects and laying the groundwork for future economic growth. The 1970s and 1980s brought economic challenges and political shifts, culminating in the [[Expo 86]] world's fair and the end of Social Credit dominance. This period also saw significant social movements, such as [[Operation Solidarity]]. There was a transition to New Democratic Party governance in the 1990s, focusing on environmental conservation and economic struggles. In its second term especially, the NDP government faced political scandals, such as the [[fast ferry scandal]], that ultimately contributed to its downfall.

===21st century===
[[File:Vancouver 2010 Public Caldron.jpg|thumb|The cauldron of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver]]
In the [[2001 British Columbia general election|2001 provincial election]], [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]]'s Liberals defeated the NDP, gaining 77 out of 79 total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies, along with selling off the previous government's "fast ferries", lowering income taxes, and instituting the controversial long-term lease of [[BC Rail]] to [[Canadian National Railway]]. Campbell led his party to victory in the [[2005 British Columbia general election|2005 provincial election]] against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition and won a third term in the [[2009 British Columbia general election|2009 provincial election]].

The province won a bid to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver and Whistler. In 2003, Vancouver's residents had voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. 64 percent of residents voted in favour of hosting.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Wallechinsky |first1=D. |title=The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics: 2010 Edition |last2=Loucky |first2=J. |year=2010 |page=12}}</ref> After the Olympic joy faded, Campbell's popularity fell. His management style, implementation of the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) despite election promises not to introduce it, and cancellation of the [[British Columbia Legislature raids|BC Rail corruption trial]]{{Disputed inline|Cancellation of the BC Rail corruption trial|date=April 2024}} led to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support: he resigned in November 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-premier-campbell-stepping-down-1.911669 |title=BC Premier Campbell stepping down |date=November 3, 2010 |access-date=May 22, 2014 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |archive-date=March 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329100656/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-premier-campbell-stepping-down-1.911669 |url-status=live }}</ref> In early 2011, former deputy premier [[Christy Clark]] became leader of the Liberals.

In the lead-up to the [[2013 British Columbia general election|2013 election]], the Liberals lagged behind the NDP by a double-digit gap in the polls but were able to achieve a surprise victory, winning a majority and making Clark the first woman to lead a party to victory in BC.<ref>{{Cite news |date=May 15, 2013 |title=Christy Clark leads BC Liberals to surprise majority |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/christy-clark-leads-b-c-liberals-to-surprise-majority-1.1315526 |url-status=live |access-date=April 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407132113/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/christy-clark-leads-b-c-liberals-to-surprise-majority-1.1315526 |archive-date=April 7, 2014}}</ref> Her government went on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]]. In [[2017 British Columbia general election|the 2017 election]], the NDP formed a minority government with the support of the Green Party through a [[confidence and supply]] agreement. In July 2017, NDP leader John Horgan was sworn in as a premier. Clark resigned and [[Andrew Wilkinson]] became leader of the BC Liberals. In the [[2020 British Columbia general election]], the NDP won 57 seats and formed a majority government. Wilkinson resigned as the leader of the BC Liberals.

British Columbia has been significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver was a major destination for many immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] who left the former UK colony prior to [[Handover of Hong Kong|its handover]] to China. Trends of urbanization mean the [[Greater Vancouver]] area now includes 51 percent of the province's population, followed by [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]] with 8 percent. These two metropolitan regions have dominated the demographics of BC.

By 2018, housing prices in Vancouver were the second-least affordable in the world.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kwan |first=Shawna |date=January 21, 2019 |title=Hong Kong Housing Is World's Least Affordable for 9th Year |website=[[Bloomberg News]] |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-21/hong-kong-housing-ranked-world-s-least-affordable-for-9th-year |url-status=live |access-date=September 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201012033331/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-21/hong-kong-housing-ranked-world-s-least-affordable-for-9th-year |archive-date=October 12, 2020}}</ref> Many experts point to evidence of money-laundering from China as a contributing factor.

Though less than 5 percent of its vast {{convert|944735|km2}} land is [[arable land|arable]], the province is agriculturally rich (particularly in the [[Fraser Valley|Fraser]] and [[Okanagan]] valleys), because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys. Its climate encourages [[outdoor recreation]] and [[tourism]], though its economic mainstay has long been [[resource extraction]], principally logging, farming, and mining. Vancouver, the province's largest city, serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average.<!-- Should the following be in climate subsection? --> While the coast of British Columbia and some valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather, the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to the rest of Canada.

British Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining. Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment, and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail/service sectors. It now has the highest percentage of service industry jobs in the west, constituting 72 percent of industry (compared to 60 percent Western Canadian average).<ref>{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Robert |url=http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Chapter_9.pdf |title=State of the West 2010 {{!}} Western Canadian Demographic and Economic Trends |publisher=[[Canada West Foundation]] |year=2010 |pages=103–109 |chapter=Economic output in the West |access-date=September 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812195015/http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Chapter_9.pdf |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The largest section of this employment is in finance, insurance, real estate and corporate management; however, many areas outside of metropolitan areas are still heavily reliant on resource extraction.

The economic history of British Columbia is replete with tales of [[Business cycle|dramatic upswings and downswings]], and this [[boom and bust]] pattern has influenced the politics, culture and business climate of the province. Economic activity related to mining in particular has widely fluctuated with changes in commodity prices over time, with documented costs to community health.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2005/05oct06/mining.html |title=Hard on Health of Mining Communities |last=Thomson |first=Hilary |date=October 6, 2005 |publisher=University of British Columbia |issue=10 |volume=51 |access-date=April 26, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415163741/http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2005/05oct06/mining.html |archive-date=April 15, 2007}}</ref>

British Columbia has an 87-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the [[plurality voting system]], though from 2003 to 2009 there was significant debate about switching to a [[single transferable vote]] system called [[BC-STV]]. The government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios, what are officially part of the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]], of whom the premier is chair.

The province is currently governed by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] (BC NDP) under Premier [[David Eby]]. The 2017 provincial election saw the Liberal Party take 43 seats, the NDP take 41, and the [[British Columbia Green Party]] take 3. No party met the minimum of 44 seats for a majority, therefore leading to the first minority government since 1953. Following the election, the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP, eventually announcing they would support an NDP minority government. Previously, the right-of-centre [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] governed the province for 16 years between 2001 and 2017, and won the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats. The legislature became more evenly divided between the Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 Liberal seats of 79) and 2009 (49 Liberal seats of 85) provincial elections. The NDP and its predecessor the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) have been the main opposition force to right-wing parties since the 1930s and have governed with majority governments in 1972–1975, 1991–2001 and since 2020 (with a minority government from 2017 to 2020). The Green Party plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. After a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39 percent), the party's vote share declined (2005 – 9.17 percent, 2009 – 8.09 percent, 2013 – 8.13 percent) before increasing again to a record high of 16.84 percent at the 2017 election.

The British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]], [[Conservative Party of Canada|federal Conservatives]], and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. In 2022, [[Kevin Falcon]] was elected leader of the BC Liberals, promising to rename the party in an effort to distance themselves from their federal counterparts. In 2023, the party rebranded as [[BC United]]. Historically, there have commonly been [[third party (politics)|third parties]] present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Green Party]] is the current third party in British Columbia, with three seats in the legislature.

Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the BC Social Credit Party, which governed the province for 20 years. While sharing some ideology with the subsequent Liberal government, they were more right-wing, although they undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries.

British Columbia is known for having politically active labour [[trade union|unions]] who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.

British Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to [[McGowan's War]] in 1858–59). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the [[Robert Bonner (politician)|Robert Bonner]] Affair and the [[Fantasy Gardens]] scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era. NDP scandals included Bingogate, which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, and the alleged scandal named Casinogate which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals plagued the 2001–2017 Liberal government, including Premier Gordon Campbell's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A [[BC Legislature Raids|raid on the Parliament Buildings]] on December 28, 2003,<ref>{{cite news |date=September 14, 2004 |title=INDEPTH: B.C. RAIDS |website=[[CBC News]] |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/bcraids/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924205051/http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/bcraids/ |archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref> in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time resigned. Campbell eventually resigned in late 2010 due to opposition to his government's plan to introduce a [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) and was replaced by [[Christy Clark]] as premier in the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election.

British Columbia is underrepresented in the [[Senate of Canada]], leading Premier Christy Clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal government's reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of an advisory board that would use non-partisan criteria. Hours after that plan was unveiled in Ottawa on December 3, 2015, Clark issued a statement that it did "not address what's been wrong with the Senate since the beginning".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Gloria |date=December 3, 2015 |title=Liberals to set up advisory board for Senate nominees, but BC won't take part |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-setting-up-advisory-board-to-fill-empty-senate-seats/article27577333/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204072945/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-setting-up-advisory-board-to-fill-empty-senate-seats/article27577333/ |archive-date=December 4, 2015}}</ref>

The imbalance in representation in that House is apparent when considering population size. The six senators from BC constitute only one for every 775,000 people vs. one for every 75,000 in Prince Edward Island, which has four senators. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have much smaller populations than BC, yet each has ten senators according to a Global News summary.<ref name="Baldrey">{{cite news |last=Baldrey |first=Keith |date=December 3, 2015 |title=Why Christy Clark is rejecting Justin Trudeau's reform of the Senate |website=[[Global News]] |publisher=Shaw Media Inc. |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2379480/why-christy-clark-is-rejecting-justin-trudeaus-reform-of-the-senate/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204035421/http://globalnews.ca/news/2379480/why-christy-clark-is-rejecting-justin-trudeaus-reform-of-the-senate/ |archive-date=December 4, 2015}}</ref> Correcting this imbalance would require a constitutional amendment, but that is unlikely to be supported by the Atlantic provinces.<ref name="Baldrey" />

==Transportation==
Transportation played a huge role in British Columbia's history. The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around [[Cape Horn]] or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.

Until the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the [[Crowsnest Highway|Crowsnest Pass Highway]]), and later the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.

{{as of|2021}}, the number of [[Plug-in electric vehicles in British Columbia|electric vehicles sold in British Columbia]] (as a percentage of total vehicle sales) was the highest of any Canadian province or U.S. state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/bc-tops-quebec-and-california-as-ev-capital-of-north-america-5224158|title=B.C. tops Quebec and California as EV capital of North America|work=Vancouver is Awesome|date=April 1, 2022|access-date=April 20, 2022|first=Stefan|last=Labbé}}</ref>

===Roads and highways===
{{Main|List of British Columbia provincial highways}}
[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge from below.jpg|thumb|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] on [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] between Richmond and Delta]]
Because of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated program of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now [[controlled-access highway|freeways]] in Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Central Interior of the province. Much of the rest of the province, where traffic volumes are generally low, is accessible by well-maintained generally high-mobility two-lane [[arterial road|arterial highways]] with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop-controlled intersections outside the main urban areas.

[[File:Highway 1, Burnaby.jpg|thumb|British Columbia Highway 1 near Brentwood, Burnaby]]
A couple of busy intercity corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median [[traffic barrier]]s. [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]] on [[Vancouver Island]] and Highway 97 through the [[Okanagan Valley]] are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from {{convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to maximums just slightly lower than the principal [[grade-separated]] highways. Numerous [[traffic light]]s operate in place of [[interchange (road)|interchanges]] on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures. Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter-urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (British Columbia)|British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure]].<ref name="BC highways">{{cite web |year=2013 |title=BC highways |url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/tran/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112834/http://www.gov.bc.ca/tran/ |archive-date=October 20, 2013 |access-date=October 24, 2013 |publisher=[[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure]]}}</ref>

There are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: [[British Columbia provincial highway 3|BC Highway 3]] through the [[Crowsnest Pass]], the [[Vermilion Pass]] (Highway 93 in both [[British Columbia Highway 93|British Columbia]] and [[Alberta Highway 93|Alberta]]), the [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through [[Banff National Park]], the [[Yellowhead Highway]] (16) through [[Jasper National Park]], and [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway 2]] through [[Dawson Creek]]. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running {{convert|2081|km}} from the British Columbia-Washington border at [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] north to [[Watson Lake, Yukon]] and which includes the British Columbia portion of the [[Alaska Highway]].

[[File:Flyer trolleybuses on the Granville Mall in 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Trolley buses in Vancouver]]]]
Prior to 1979, surface [[public transport|public transit]] in the Vancouver and Victoria metropolitan areas was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established [[BC Transit]] to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, now [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District, was established. Some smaller island communities, such as [[Gabriola Island]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gabriolacommunitybus.com/about/history/ |title=History: GERTIE: Gabriola's Environmentally Responsible Trans Island Express |website=GERTIE |access-date=November 13, 2018 |archive-date=July 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727015217/https://gabriolacommunitybus.com/about/history/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and, formerly, [[Pender Island]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penderbus.org/about |title=About the Bus |website=Pender Island Community Bus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113210800/http://penderbus.org/about |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |title=Community Bus Pilot Project Ending |website=Pender Island Community Bus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110235046/http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |archive-date=January 10, 2019 |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> operate routes independent of BC Transit or TransLink.

===Rail===
{{British Columbia rail network}}
[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|upright|CPR train traversing the [[Stoney Creek Bridge]]]]
Rail development expanded greatly in the decades after the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was completed, in 1885, and was the chief mode of long-distance surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the 1950s. Two major routes through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway – the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]], terminating at Prince Rupert, and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], terminating at Vancouver.

The [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] provided rail services in Victoria and Vancouver between the nineteenth century and mid twentieth century.

The [[BC Rail|Pacific Great Eastern]] line supplemented this service, providing a north–south route between interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]] with [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]]. The E&N Railway, rebranded as the [[Island Rail Corridor]], formerly served the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island. Service along the route is now minimal. Vancouver Island was also host to the [[Englewood Railway|last logging railway in North America]] until its closure in 2017.

Current passenger services in British Columbia are limited. [[Via Rail]] operates 10 long-distance trains per week on two lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/VIARail_Timetable.pdf |title=Via Rail Timetable |website=Via Rail Canada |access-date=January 10, 2019 |archive-date=December 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218103920/https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/VIARail_Timetable.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Local services are limited to two regions, with [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] providing rapid transit and commuter services in the [[Lower Mainland]] and by the [[Seton Lake Indian Band]] South of [[Lillooet]] with the [[Kaoham Shuttle]].

Several [[heritage railway]]s operate within the province, including the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] that runs between [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]] via British Columbia.

===Water===
[[File:Spirit of Vancouver Island.jpg|thumb|''Spirit of Vancouver Island'' S-class ferry]]
[[BC Ferries]] was established as a provincial crown corporation in 1960 to provide passenger and vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland as a cheaper and more reliable alternative to the service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway and other private operators. It now operates 25 routes among the [[List of islands of British Columbia|islands of British Columbia]], as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the [[Washington State Ferries]] (between [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]]) and [[MV Coho|Black Ball Transport]] (between Victoria and [[Port Angeles, Washington]]). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure|Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure]]. Various other coastal ferries are operated privately.

Commercial ocean transport is of vital importance. Major ports are at Vancouver, [[Roberts Bank]] (near [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]), Prince Rupert, and Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=909&Itemid=98 |title=International Shipping in British Columbia |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729172613/http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=909&Itemid=98 |archive-date=July 29, 2013 |access-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/images/docs/BCPortsHandbook2014.pdf |title=''BC Ports handbook'' |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC |access-date=November 21, 2019 |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224184116/http://www.cosbc.ca/images/docs/BCPortsHandbook2014.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The earliest known [[visual art]] produced in the [[Pacific Northwest]], and what would become British Columbia, was by First Nations such as the Coast Salish, Haida, Heiltsuk, and Tsimshian, among others. Such Indigenous work comes particularly in the form of [[woodcarving]], as seen in [[totem poles]], [[transformation mask]]s, and [[canoes]], as well as [[textile arts]] like [[Chilkat weaving]] and [[button blankets]]. Traditional Indigenous art of the Pacific Northwest is typically distinguished by the [[formline art|formline style]], which is defined as "continuous, flowing, curvilinear lines that turn, swell and diminish in a prescribed manner. They are used for figure outlines, internal design elements and in abstract compositions."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/northwest-coast-aboriginal-art|title=Northwest Coast Indigenous Art|author=Marjorie M.

==Outdoor life and athletics==
[[File:Whistler ice sailor.jpg|thumb|Ice sailing in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]]]
[[File:Holland Point Shoreline Trail, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada 05.jpg|thumb|Shoreline Trail in Victoria]]
Given its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, [[rock climbing]] and mountaineering, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].

Water sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. [[Sea kayak]]ing opportunities abound on the British Columbia coast with its [[fjord]]s. [[Whitewater rafting]] and [[kayak]]ing are popular on many inland rivers. [[Sailing]] and [[Windsurfing|sailboarding]] are widely enjoyed.

In winter, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] and [[telemark skiing]] are much enjoyed, and in recent decades high-quality [[Alpine skiing|downhill]] [[skiing]] has been developed in the Coast Mountain range and the Rockies, as well as in the southern areas of the Shuswap Highlands and the [[Columbia Mountains]]. [[Snowboarding]] has mushroomed in popularity since the early 1990s. The [[2010 Winter Olympics]] downhill events were held in [[Whistler Blackcomb]] area of the province, while the indoor events were conducted in the Vancouver area.

In Vancouver and Victoria (as well as some other cities), opportunities for [[jogging|joggers]] and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the [[Bicycle gearing|ten-speed]] bike became available many years ago. Since the advent of the more robust [[mountain bike]], trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. A 2016 poll on global biking website Pinkbike rated BC as the top destination mountain bikers would like to ride.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Felton |first=Vernon |date=August 26, 2016 |title=Where would you go, if you could road trip anywhere? – Pinkbike Poll |work=Pinkbike |url=https://www.pinkbike.com/news/where-would-you-go-if-you-could-road-trip-anywhere-pinkbike-poll-2016.html |url-status=live |access-date=March 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303045620/https://www.pinkbike.com/news/where-would-you-go-if-you-could-road-trip-anywhere-pinkbike-poll-2016.html |archive-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. [[Longboarding]] is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.

[[Equestrianism|Horseback riding]] is enjoyed by many British Columbians. Opportunities for [[trail riding]], often into especially scenic areas, have been established for tourists in numerous areas of the province.

British Columbia also has strong participation levels in many other sports, including [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Canadian football]], [[rugby union]], [[lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[basketball]], [[curling]], [[disc golf]], [[Ultimate Canada|Ultimate]] and [[figure skating]]. British Columbia has produced many outstanding athletes, especially in aquatic and [[winter sports]].

Consistent with both increased tourism and increased participation in diverse recreations by British Columbians has been the proliferation of [[Resort hotel|lodges]], [[chalet]]s, [[bed and breakfast]]s, motels, hotels, fishing camps, and park-camping facilities in recent decades.

In certain areas, there are businesses, non-profit societies, or municipal governments dedicated to promoting [[ecotourism]] in their region. A number of British Columbia farmers offer visitors to combine tourism with farm work, for example, through the [[WWOOF]] Canada program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wwoof.ca/|title=WWOOF Canada|website=wwoof.ca|access-date=April 11, 2020|archive-date=April 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412231039/https://wwoof.ca/|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{See also|Education in British Columbia}}
British Columbia is home to a comprehensive education system consisting of public schools and independent schools that is overseen by the provincial Ministry of Education. The public school system is divided in 59 anglophone school districts and one francophone school district, the ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]],'' which operates French-language public schools throughout the province.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jacquet |first=Marianne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQPnUO4z0XkC |title=Educators' Discourses on Student Diversity in Canada: Context, Policy, and Practice |publisher=Canadian Scholars' Press |year=2008 |isbn=9781551303468 |editor-last=Gérin-Lajoie |editor-first=Diane |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WQPnUO4z0XkC&pg=PA54 54] |chapter=The Discourse on Diversity in British Columbia Public Schools: From Difference to In/Difference |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQPnUO4z0XkC&pg=PA51 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319141154/https://books.google.com/books?id=WQPnUO4z0XkC&pg=PA54 |archive-date=March 19, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The anglophone school districts are governed by school board trustees who are directly elected by the school district's residents. Although 86 percent of students are enrolled in the public school system, British Columbia has one of the highest shares of independent school enrolment among Canadian province, at 14 percent of the student population, due to its relatively generous funding model; most independent schools receive 50 percent of the operating funding that their public counterparts receive from the government. A very small percentage (less than 1 percent) of students are home schooled.

Like most other provinces in Canada, education is compulsory from ages 6 to 16 (grades 1–10), although the vast majority of students remain in school until they graduate from high school ([[Twelfth grade|grade 12]]) at the age of 18. In order to graduate with a graduation certificate, known as a Dogwood Diploma in BC, students must take a minimum of 80 course credits during grades 10 to 12. These credits include a variety of required courses (e.g. in language arts, social studies, mathematics, and science), as well as elective courses.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Care |first=Ministry of Education and Child |title=Graduation Requirements – Province of British Columbia |url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/administration/legislation-policy/public-schools/graduation-requirements |access-date=July 21, 2022 |website=www2.gov.bc.ca}}</ref>

Academic achievement in British Columbia is relatively good, although it has been slipping in recent years by some measures. In 2020, 86 percent of students in British Columbia graduated from high school within six years of entering grade 8.<ref>{{Cite report |title=B.C. Education System Performance – B.C.

===Higher education===

[[File:Quest University Canada Aerial View.jpg|thumb|upright|Quest University Canada Academic Building, aerial view]]
British Columbia has a diverse array of higher educational institutions, ranging from publicly funded universities, colleges, and institutes, to private universities, colleges, seminaries, and career institutes. Public institutions receive approximately half of their funding from grants from the provincial government, with the remaining revenue stemming from tuition charges and philanthropic donations.<ref>{{Cite report |last=Auditor General |date=2008 |title=Government's post-secondary expansion: 25,000 seats by 2010 |url=http://www.aud.gov.bc.ca/PUBS/2006-07/Report7/PostSecondaryExp2006.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.aud.gov.bc.ca/PUBS/2006-07/Report7/PostSecondaryExp2006.pdf |archive-date=October 9, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> Each post-secondary institution sets its own admission requirements, although the standard requirement is the completion of high school.
