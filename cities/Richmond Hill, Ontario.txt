Part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]], it is the York Region's third most populous municipality and the [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|27th most populous]] municipality in Canada. Richmond Hill is situated between the cities of [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] and [[Vaughan]], north of [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]], and south of [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]].

Richmond Hill has seen significant population growth since the 1990s.

The [[Regional Municipality of York]] was established by Bill 102 ''An Act to Establish the Regional Municipality of York'' of the provincial parliament, passed on June 26, 1970, and coming into force on January 1, 1971.<ref name="POST1930V">{{cite book |title=The Challenging Seventies |work=Later Days in Richmond Hill - A History of the Community from 1930 to 1999 |author=Marney Beck Robinson and Joan M. Clark |publisher=Town of Richmond Hill/Richmond Hill Public Library Board |year=2000 |isbn=0-9695376-1-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/laterdaysinrichm0000robi}}</ref> The act expanded Richmond Hill's borders, annexing parts of [[Whitchurch Township]], [[Markham Township]], [[Vaughan Township]] and [[King Township, Ontario|King Township]] into Richmond Hill, expanding the area covered from {{cvt|1700|acre|km2}} to {{cvt|27000|acre|km2}} and the population from a little over 19,000 to some 34,000. Historically the town was bounded along a narrow strip along Yonge Street from Lots 48 to 46 (about Crosby Avenue down to Major Mackenzie Drive), as far east as Church Street and slightly west of Mill Pond (excluding Lot 46 where it ended just north of Arnold Crescent or eastern end of today's Don Head Park). The town grew to encompass the communities of [[Gormley, Ontario|Gormley]], [[Dollar, Ontario|Dollar]], [[Langstaff, Ontario|Langstaff]], [[Carrville, Ontario|Carrville]], Headford, [[Elgin Mills, Ontario|Elgin Mills]], [[Jefferson, Ontario|Jefferson]], Bond Lake, [[Temperanceville, Ontario|Temperanceville]], [[Lake Wilcox, Ontario|Lake Wilcox]], [[Oak Ridges, Ontario|Oak Ridges]] and Richvale. While Richmond Hill was a prosperous, well developed town, many of the outlying areas annexed were far more [[rural]], with [[dirt road]]s, no water mains or sewers and no [[streetlight]]s, and the time needed to bring municipal services up in these areas, combined with residual unequal tax assessments caused considerable conflict in the municipal politics. Policing was taken over by the [[York Regional Police]], but fire protection remained with Richmond Hill, whose firefighting force quickly grew. Having hired its first full-time employee in 1967, it had fourteen full-time employees by 1971.

[[York Regional Road 1|Yonge Street]] through Richmond Hill expanded from two lanes to four in 1971, relieving congestion on what was known as "Ontario's worst stretch of highway".<ref name="POST1930V" />

The Richmond Hill Dynes Jewellers softball team was the 1972 Softball World Champions.<ref name="POST1930V" /> The [[Royal Canadian Air Farce]] was recorded at the Curtain Club Theatre in Richmond Hill for its first 5 seasons on radio, beginning in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airfarce.com/history.html |title=History of Air Farce |publisher=Air Farce Productions Inc. |access-date=2006-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205080424/http://www.airfarce.com/history.html |archive-date=2014-12-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Air Farce returned for an anniversary recording in the 1990s. Also in 1973 was the centennial of the town's incorporation as a village, and the town set up a number of celebratory activities, including a [[beard]] growing contest, commissioning a centennial song, a [[parade]], a [[street dance]] and the unveiling of a historic plaque honouring the town's founding in front of the municipal offices. June 27 was officially declared Russell Lynett Day, named after the town's [[town clerk|clerk]], only the third in its existence. 1973 also saw the sale of the last of the original rose-growing greenhouses in Richmond Hill. Development had led to increasing property taxes and the H.J. Mills greenhouses relocated to Bayview Avenue and Elgin Mill Road. The site of the greenhouses was developed as a subdivision. The fast-growing town set aside significant areas for [[List of parks in Richmond Hill, Ontario|parks]], with five new parks dedicated in 1973, and two more in 1974. The Richmond Hill Historical Society was founded in 1973.<ref name="POST1930V" /> The society was dedicated to preserving the history of Richmond Hill and raising awareness of the town's history. Their first action was to restore a 150-year-old house, known as the ''Burr House''.

As the 1970s went on, the population growth of Richmond Hill remained large. In 1976, home prices in Richmond Hill were among the highest in Canada.<ref name="POST1930V" /> By this time, the [[Richmond Hill Town Council|town council]] was split over whether to keep expanding rapidly. The deadlock over a fifty-five house subdivision named ''Springmills Estate'' led to one councillor saying that it was not the reform council it was dubbed, but a "deformed council". Other housing projects faced similar problems as councillors debated many things, including the need for [[affordable housing]] and the encroachment of homes into the farmland and the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]].

[[GO train]] service was extended to Richmond Hill in 1978, officially opened on April 29, 1978, by [[Bill Davis]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Burgers outdraw Davis at GO train inaugural |author=Richard Furness |work=The Globe and Mail |date=May 1, 1978 |pages=4 |issn=0319-0714}}</ref>

Growth in Richmond Hill slowed towards the end of the 1970s, with M.L. McConaghy Public School closing in 1979 due to dropping enrolment.<ref name="POST1930V" /> At the same time, Richmond Hill began to make official [[Development plan|plan]]s for future land development. The first official plan concerned a {{cvt|700|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[industrial park]] at [[Leslie Street]] and [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]] named ''Beaver Creek''. A commercial area within the park spread into the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Dollar, Ontario|Dollar]]. The plan was rejected, however, by the [[Ontario Municipal Board]], and Richmond Hill was the first municipality in Ontario to have its official plan rejected outright by the board. The whole affair was subject to much controversy in the community, although the [[Richmond Hill Town Council|town council]] eventually declined to appeal the decision.

When the new council convened in 1980, led by new mayor Al Duffy, the town remained without a development plan. The council hired civic planner Peter Walker to produce a new official plan. By September 1981, the new plan was drafted, with limited development of northern Richmond Hill, [[Industrial sector|industrial]] development centred in the south-east part of town and commercial centres remaining along [[Yonge Street]].<ref name="POST1930VI">{{cite book |title=The Dream Years |work=Later Days in Richmond Hill - A History of the Community from 1930 to 1999 |author=Marney Beck Robinson and Joan M.

A clash over the use of the land in [[Langstaff, Ontario|Langstaff]], known as the ''Langstaff Jail Farm'' erupted in 1982 between Richmond Hill and [[Toronto]], which owned the land.<ref>{{cite news |title=It's the neighbour again |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=April 2, 1982 |pages=6}}</ref> The {{cvt|632|acre|km2|adj=on}} plot of land had been acquired by Toronto in 1911, and was unused in 1982. Toronto's plans for development clashed with those of Richmond Hill over the balance of industry and residential development, with Richmond Hill favouring more industrial development.<ref>{{cite news |title=Toronto after fast buck, Richmond Hill protests |author=Zuhair Kashmeri |date=April 1, 1982 |work=The Globe and Mail |pages=3}}</ref>

The rose business left Richmond Hill in June 1982, with the closure of H.J. Mills florists. Mills died in 1980, leaving the company to his son, but the poor economic conditions, combined with increasing property taxes in the growing city made the business unprofitable.<ref name="POST1930VI" /> A 1984 contest organised by ''The Liberal'' had readers submit entries for a new town slogan. The town council chose three of the submissions which residents then voted on, and "A little north, a little nicer" became Richmond Hill's new town slogan.

Richmond Hill's growth continued during the 1990s, fuelled in significant part by [[immigration]], with many businesses opened on Highway 7 around Leslie Street serving the [[Chinatowns in Toronto#Chinese communities in the GTA|new Chinese Community]] that formed there. In the early 90s, [[Statistics Canada]] named Richmond Hill as Canada's fastest-growing community.<ref name="POST1930VII">{{cite book |title=Growing Success |work=Later Days in Richmond Hill - A History of the Community from 1930 to 1999 |author=Marney Beck Robinson and Joan M.

On March 25, 2019, the [[Richmond Hill City Council|Richmond Hill Council]] passed a motion to change the title of Richmond Hill from 'town' to 'city'.<ref name="Wang">{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/9241744-richmond-hill-changes-status-from-town-to-city/ |title=Richmond Hill changes status from town to city |last=Wang |first=Sheila |newspaper=Richmond Hill Liberal |date=26 March 2019 |access-date=13 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413152007/https://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/9241744-richmond-hill-changes-status-from-town-to-city/ |archive-date=April 13, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Politics==
The city's motto is ''{{lang|fr|En la rose, je fleuris}}'' (French for "Like the rose, I flourish"), reflecting either the motto of the Duke of Richmond, or the fact that the city was a centre of rose-growing in the early 20th century. At that time, it was known as the "Rose Capital" of Canada. A more recent motto for Richmond Hill is ''A little north, a little nicer''.

Richmond Hill is the only municipal Canadian government to have [[light pollution]] laws in place, due to the presence of the [[David Dunlap Observatory]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Scott |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8BUvl2nNTAC&dq=richmond+hill+light+pollution+bylaw&pg=PA29 |title=Secret Toronto: The Unique Guidebook to Toronto's Hidden Sites, Sounds and Tastes |date=2002 |publisher=ECW Press |isbn=978-1-55022-494-8 |pages=29 |language=en |access-date=December 4, 2021 |archive-date=October 12, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221012010051/https://books.google.com/books?id=q8BUvl2nNTAC&dq=richmond+hill+light+pollution+bylaw&pg=PA29 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In June 2013, the city's council passed a bylaw to ban the number 4 from new street numbers because it is considered to be [[Tetraphobia|bad luck in some East Asian cultures]].<ref>{{cite web |title=No. 4 banned from new Richmond Hill, Ont., street addresses |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/no-4-banned-from-new-richmond-hill-ont-street-addresses-1.1389822 |publisher=CBC News |access-date=9 June 2013 |date=June 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608073350/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/04/richmond-hill-4.html |archive-date=June 8, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Governance===

The city is governed by the [[Richmond Hill City Council]], which operates on a [[Mayor-Council system]] with six Ward Councillors and two Regional Councillors, plus the Mayor. The council serves a four-year term, after which a new council is elected by qualified electors in Richmond Hill.

The council derives its authority primarily from the ''[[Municipal Act]]'' and the [[Law|amendments]] of the ''[[Municipal Law Amendment Act, 2006]]''.<ref name="CG">{{cite web |url=http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page5030.aspx |title=Municipal Councillor's Guide |publisher=Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Municipal Services Offices (Ontario) |access-date=December 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030014823/http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page5030.aspx |archive-date=October 30, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Richmond Hill is a [[List of municipalities in Ontario#Lower-tier municipalities|Lower-tier municipality]] and has the roles and responsibilities of that position.

The city is also responsible for maintaining its finances in order to provide relevant services and for maintaining an official plan to guide development.

===Elections===

===Other neighbourhoods===
====Oak Ridges====
[[Oak Ridges, Ontario|Oak Ridges]] is an unincorporated community to the north of Richmond Hill's downtown and south of Aurora.

Historically, it had a post office from 1851 to the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://edrh.rhpl.richmondhill.on.ca/default.asp?ID=sae |first=Robert M. |last=Stamp |title=Early Days in Richmond Hill |chapter=Appendix E.

Oak Ridges was annexed by Richmond Hill in 1971. It is largely residential, with most commercial development located along Yonge Street. The city developed around [[Lake Wilcox, Ontario|Lake Wilcox]], the largest lake in the area and a community within Oak Ridges, and has continued to expand slowly since its annexation. In the 1990s, Oak Ridges experienced moderate growth, which has spurred environmental action and anti-development movements by numerous organizations. Population has grown significantly as a result of development initiatives along Bayview Avenue. The Oak Ridges Community Centre was built and completed in June 2012 to accommodate community demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmondhill.ca/subpage.asp?pageid=parks_oak_ridges_community_centre |title=Oak Ridges Community Centre & Park |access-date=28 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016193622/http://www.richmondhill.ca/subpage.asp?pageid=parks_oak_ridges_community_centre |archive-date=October 16, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1814 most of these settlers had left.<ref name="EDRH">{{cite book |last1=Stamp |first1=Robert |title=Early Days in Richmond Hill |chapter-url=http://edrh.rhpl.richmondhill.on.ca/default.asp?ID=s3.5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304065013/http://edrh.rhpl.richmondhill.on.ca/default.asp?ID=s3.5 |archive-date=March 4, 2006 |chapter=Chapter 3 - The European Settlers Arrive}}</ref>

St. George's family either died or left Canada for France and was the only member to remain in the area. He died in 1896 and is buried at Temperanceville United Church.<ref name="EDRH"/>

The Windham name would disappear after 1860s as Jefferson and Oak Ridges succeeded as new settlements. French Royalist Park in Jefferson is the only reminder of the French settlers.

==Transportation==
===Road networks===
[[File:16th Avenue in Richmond Hill 2023.jpg|thumb|16th Avenue in Richmond Hill]]
The city of Richmond Hill is well serviced in terms of transportation facilities for a community of its size. The eastern border of the city is [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway 404]], a major highway that leads directly into the core of the City of Toronto via the [[Don Valley Parkway]] (DVP). Highway 404 also intersects with [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] in North York, which is one of the most traversed highways on the planet and is the principal east–west route in the [[Greater Toronto Area|Greater Toronto Area (GTA)]]. The city's southern border is defined by the former [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]] and a parallel toll expressway, [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]]. The latter is a toll route and was designed as a bypass for the 401. The combined effect of these highways ensures that Richmond Hill is well integrated into Ontario's road network and has easy access for all road vehicles. The ease of accessing the city is threatened by increasing traffic due to growth in the region, as the resulting commutes diminish the usefulness of the road network.

===Public transit===
[[File:RichmondHillCentre27.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richmond Hill Centre Terminal]]]]
Public transit within the city of Richmond Hill is on buses co-ordinated by [[York Region Transit]] (YRT). In September 2005, YRT unveiled a new [[rapid transit]] initiative entitled [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|VIVA]] which provides enhanced bus service on major routes using vehicles capable of speeding up traffic lights to lessen the time they idle. [[Viva Blue]], [[Viva Purple]], [[Viva Orange]], and [[Viva Pink]] have stops in Richmond Hill. In addition, YRT operates several feeder routes on secondary streets in the city.

Commuter train service is provided to the city by [[GO Transit]] on the [[Richmond Hill line]] with four stations in the city, [[Bloomington GO Station|Bloomington Station]], [[Gormley GO Station|Gormley Station]], [[Richmond Hill GO Station|Richmond Hill Station]] and [[Langstaff GO Station|Langstaff Station]]. Langstaff Station is near the new [[Richmond Hill Centre Terminal]] of York Region Transit at Highway 7 and Yonge Street, and is connected to it by a pedestrian bridge opened in March 2008. The Richmond Hill Centre Terminal is complete with enclosed heating areas, payphones, and credit card/debit card ticket purchasing machines.

Owing to its proximity to Toronto, there are [[Line 1 Yonge–University#Yonge North expansion plan|plans to extend]] [[Line 1 Yonge-University]] of the [[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC]] [[Toronto subway|subway system]] to the intersection of Yonge and Highway 7. The project is in its preliminary planning, design and engineering (PDE) phase, with funding from the federal and provincial governments.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vivanext.com/project_YongeSubway |title=Yonge Subway Extension |website=www.vivanext.com |publisher=York Region Rapid Transit Corporation |access-date=December 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117171442/http://www.vivanext.com/project_YongeSubway |archive-date=January 17, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Other transportation===
Richmond Hill is minimally serviced by other modes of transportation. Its landlocked situation inhibits any water transportation and it lacks an airport of its own, though it does border on Markham's [[Buttonville Airport]]. The closest international airport is [[Pearson International Airport]].

==Geography and climate==
Richmond Hill is bounded by Bloomington Rd. (Aurora town limit) to the north, York Regional Road 7 (Vaughan city limit west of Yonge St., Markham city limit east of Yonge St.) to the south, Bathurst St. (Vaughan city limit) to the west, and Ontario Highway 404 (Markham city limit) to the east. Its southern limit is about {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=off}} north of the Toronto city limit, [[Steeles Avenue]], and approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=off}} north of the downtown core of Toronto. The city extends {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=off}} north–south and {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=off}} east–west.

The predominant feature of the city's geography, as its name suggests, is its elevation above surrounding regions. Thousands of years ago during the last [[ice-age]], [[glacier]]s moving in a southerly direction amassed a considerable amount of earth in front of them which they carried forward as they grew. Gradually, as the temperature increased the growth of the glaciers lessened and eventually they began to recede to what is now the polar ice cap. The earth that had been collected by the glacier's movement was left in place and the elevated region that remained comprises modern day Richmond Hill.

The city itself is at a much greater elevation than other communities within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and with the exclusion of areas closely alongside its borders, the constituent of York region with the greatest height above sea level. The uneven melting of the glacier that formed the city has led to an extremely varied geography within the city's own borders, leading to such features as [[kettle lake]]s, minor tributaries and most notably the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]].

Kettle lakes are the result of glacier water getting caught in water-tight depressions in the land and are sustained by only rainfall in the immediate area. The City of Richmond Hill has many of these water bodies and its three largest in order of decreasing size are Lake Wilcox, Bond Lake and Philips Lake. The kettle lakes are predominantly confined to the northern fringes of the city.
[[File:RichmondGreen.jpg|thumb|Footbridge in Richmond Green Sports Centre & Park]]
Being elevated above the surrounding region, precipitation in the city tends to flow outwards via the multitude of streams and rivers that flow through the city. Principally water flow is in one of two directions, south to [[Lake Ontario]] or north to [[Lake Simcoe]] where they join up with larger tributaries that feed into the water bodies. Of note are the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge]], [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber]], and [[Don River (Toronto)|Don]] rivers, which receive some of their flow from sources in the city.

Perhaps the most important geographical feature of the City of Richmond Hill is the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]]. The moraine is a further elevated region of loose soil which comprises a significant portion (roughly the northern third) of the land area of the city. Its porous nature allows the collection and natural filtering of waters that flow through it which are then fed into multiple underground [[aquifer]]s. While the city receives its water from the City of Toronto, these aquifers are an important source for those with their own wells in addition to surrounding communities. The ability of the soil to hold so much water means that despite Richmond Hill's comparatively high elevation, it has a very high water table which poses some problems to construction. The moraine is also host to a staggering amount of biodiversity and in recent years there has been a considerable amount of pressure applied to government to shield the area from development. Consequently, a considerable portion of Richmond Hill is subject to the Ontario Government's [[Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe)|Greenbelt]] legislation.
