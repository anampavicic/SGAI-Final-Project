'''Ramos Arizpe''' ({{IPA|es|ˈramos aˈɾispe}}) is a city and seat of the [[Ramos Arizpe (municipality)|surrounding municipality of the same name]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Coahuila]]. Ramos Arizpe is located 11&nbsp;km from the state capital of [[Saltillo]]. It is part of the Saltillo [[metropolitan area]]. The city reported a population of 48,228 in the 2005 census; the municipality had a population of 56,708. Its area is 5,306.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2,048.9 sq mi).

Ramos Arizpe was established originally in 1577 as Valle de las Labores, a name chosen as the soil was conducive to agriculture.

==History==
In the year 1606 the town was renamed Valle de San Nicolás de la Capellanía, because Spanish missionaries had taken there a sacred image of [[Saint Nicholas of Tolentino]].

It is now a major industrial center, founded in 1974, featuring many automotive industrial parks. Several major companies have large operations in Ramos Arizpe or vicinity, such the [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly]] plant (Home of the Chevy C2, [[Pontiac Aztek]], [[Buick Rendezvous]], [[Saturn Vue]], [[Cadillac SRX]], [[Saab 9-4X]] and [[Chevrolet HHR|HHR]]), Chrysler [[Saltillo Engine Plant]] (Home of the 5.7L V8 HEMI engine) and other suppliers such as Magna, Stabilus, ZF Sachs and Macimex. As of 2016 the plant produces about one third of the firm's full-sized pickups.<ref name="NYT021317">{{cite news|author1=Bill Vlasic|title=Profitable Pickups May Be in Cross Hairs of Trump Border Tax|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/business/general-motors-mexico-pickups.html|access-date=14 February 2017|work=The New York Times|date=13 February 2017|quote=And while Fiat Chrysler is expanding its American output of trucks, it still relies on its factory in Saltillo, Mexico, for 30 to 40 percent of its pickups}}</ref>

[[Plan de Guadalupe International Airport]] serving Saltillo and Ramos Arizpe (Iata: SLW) is located there.
