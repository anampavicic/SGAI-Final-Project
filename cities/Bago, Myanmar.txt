'''Bago''' (formerly spelled '''Pegu''';<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pegu |volume=21 |page=58 |ref=none}}</ref> {{MYname|MY={{my|ပဲခူးမြို့}}|MLCTS=pai: khu: mrui.}}, {{IPA-my|bəɡó mjo̰|IPA}}), formerly known as '''Hanthawaddy''', is a city and the capital of the [[Bago Region]] in [[Myanmar]]. It is located {{convert|91|km|mi}} north-east of [[Yangon]].

==Etymology==
The Burmese name '''Bago''' (ပဲခူး) is likely derived from the [[Mon language]] place name '''Bagaw''' ({{langx|mnw|ဗဂေါ}}, {{IPA-mnw|bəkɜ̀|}}). Until the Burmese government [[List of renamed places in Myanmar|renamed English place names]] throughout the country in 1989, Bago was known as '''Pegu'''. Bago was formerly known as '''Hanthawaddy''' ({{Langx|my|ဟံသာဝတီ}}; {{Langx|mnw|ဟံသာဝတဳ}} {{transl|mnw|Hongsawatoi}}; {{Langx|pi|italic=yes|Haṃsāvatī}}; lit. "she who possesses the [[Hamsa (bird)|sheldrake]]"), the name of a Burmese-Mon kingdom.

An alternative etymology from the 1947 Burmese Encyclopedia derives Bago (ပဲခူး) from '''Wanpeku''' ({{langx|my|ဝမ်းပဲကူး}}) as a shortening of Where the Hinthawan Ducks Graze ({{langx|my|ဟင်္သာဝမ်းဘဲများ ကူးသန်းကျက်စားရာ အရပ်}}). This etymology relies on the non-phonetic Burmese spelling as its main reasoning.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Burma Translation Society |title=Myanma Swesone Kyan |date=1947 |publisher=BStephen Austin & Sons |volume=6 |location=London |script-title=my:မြန်မာ့ စွယ်စုံကျမ်း |trans-title=Burmese Encyclopedia}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Shwethalyaungbuddhabago.jpg|thumb|left|The 177&nbsp;ft (54&nbsp;m) [[Shwethalyaung Temple|Shwethalyaung Buddha]], constructed in 994&nbsp;A.D. by King Migadepa]]

===Establishment===

Various [[Mon language]] [[Burmese chronicles|chronicles]] report widely divergent foundation dates of Bago, ranging from 573&nbsp;CE to 1152&nbsp;CE<ref group=note>A version of the 18th century chronicle ''[[Slapat Rajawan]]'' as reported by [[Arthur Purves Phayre|Arthur Phayre]] (Phayre 1873: 32) states that the settlement was founded in 1116 [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]] (572/573&nbsp;CE). But another version of the ''Slapat'', used by P.W. Schmidt (Schmidt 1906: 20, 101), states that it was founded on 1st waxing of [[Tabodwe|Mak (Tabodwe)]] 1116&nbsp;BE ({{circa}} 19 January 573&nbsp;CE), which it says is equivalent to year 514 of "the third era", without specifying what the era specifically was. However, per (Phayre 1873: 39), one of the "native records" used by Maj. Lloyd says that Pegu was founded in 514 [[Burmese calendar|Burmese (Myanmar) Era]] (1152/1153&nbsp;CE). <br/> If the year 514 is indeed the Burmese Era, then the ''Slapat's'' 1st waxing of Tabodwe 514 would be 27 December 1152, equivalent to 1st waxing of Tabodwe 1696&nbsp;BE (not 1116&nbsp;BE).</ref> while the ''[[Zabu Kuncha]]'', an early 15th century Burmese administrative treatise, states that Pegu was founded in 1276/77&nbsp;CE.{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|2017|p=332}}

The earliest extant evidence of Pegu as a place dates only to the late [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan period]] (1212 and 1266)<ref group=note>(Aung-Thwin 2005: 59) cites the inscription found at the Min-Nan-Thu village near [[Bagan]], which as shown in (SMK Vol. 3 1983: 28–31) was donated by daughter of Theingathu, dated Thursday, 7th waxing of Nanka (Wagaung) 628&nbsp;ME (8 July 1266), and lists Pegu as Pe-Ku. (Aung-Thwin 2017: 200, 332) updates by saying that the earliest extant inscriptions that mention Pegu date to 1212 and 1266 but does not provide the source of the 1212 inscription. It must be a recent discovery as none of the inscriptions listed in the ''Ancient Burmese Stone Inscriptions'' (SMK Vol. 1 1972: 93–102) for years 573&nbsp;ME (1211/1212) or 574&nbsp;ME (1212/1213) shows Pe-Ku or Pegu.</ref> when it was still a small town, not even a provincial capital. After the collapse of the Pagan Empire, Bago became part of the breakaway [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Kingdom of Martaban]] by the 1290s.

The earliest possible external record of Bago dates to 1028 CE. The Thiruvalangadu plate describe [[Rajendra Chola I]], the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] Emperor from South India, as having conquered "Kadaram" in the fourteenth year of his reign – 1028 CE. According to one interpretation, Kadaram refers to Bago.<ref name="sastrip">{{Cite book |last=Sastri |first=K. A.

===Growth===
[[File:Elefante Portugues.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Portuguese Ruler and his Soldiers-Drawing by Philips, Jan Caspar (engraver)]]

The small settlement grew increasingly important in the 14th century as the region became most populous in the Mon-speaking kingdom. In 1369, King [[Binnya U]] made Bago the capital. During the reign of King [[Razadarit]], Bago and the [[Ava Kingdom]] were engaged in the [[Forty Years' War]]. The peaceful reign of Queen [[Shin Sawbu]] came to an end when she chose the [[Buddhist monk]] [[Dhammazedi]] (1471–1492) to succeed her. Under Dhammazedi, Bago became a centre of commerce and [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]].

In 1519, [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]], then a merchant from the Portuguese ''casados'' settlement at [[Cochin]], landed in Bago (known to the Portuguese as Pegu) looking for new markets for pepper from Cochin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Luís Filipe Tomás |url=http://actd.iict.pt/eserv/actd:SEPV096/n096.pdf |title=A viagem de António Correia a Pegu em 1519 |date=1976 |publisher=Junta de Investigações do Ultramar |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Malekandathil, Pius M C |title=Origin and Growth of Luso-Indian Community in Portuguese Cochin and the maritime trade of India, 1500–6663 |date=2010-10-26 |url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/13205/10/10_chapter%203.pdf |publisher=Pondicherry University}}</ref>{{nonspecific|date=January 2023}} A year later, [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Portuguese India Governor]] [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] sent an ambassador to Pegu.

===Toungoo dynastic capital===
{{See also|Toungoo dynasty}}

[[File:Kanbawzathadi Palace - Bago, Myanmar 20130219-01.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Kanbawzathadi Palace]]
The city remained the capital until the kingdom's fall in 1538. The ascendant [[Toungoo dynasty]] under [[Tabinshwehti]] made numerous raids that the much larger kingdom could not muster its resources against. While the kingdom would have a brief resurgence for 2 years in the 1550s, Tabinshwehti's successor [[Bayinnaung]] would firmly come to control Bago in 1553.<ref name="Harvey">{{Cite book |last=Harvey |first=G. E. |title=History of Burma: From the Earliest Times to 10 March 1824 |date=1925 |publisher=Frank Cass & Co. Ltd |location=London |page=153-157, 171}}</ref>

In late 1553, Bago was proclaimed the new capital with commissioning of a new palace, the [[Kanbawzathadi Palace]] and Bayinnaung's coronation itself in January 1554. Over the next decade, Bago gradually become the capital of more land and eventually the largest empire in Indochina. A 1565 rebellion by resettled Shans in Bago burnt down major swaths of the city and the palace complex and the Kanbawzathadi Palace was rebuilt. Bayinnaung, this time, added 20 gates to the city named after the vassal who built it
[[File:Plan of Bago 1568.png|thumb|200x200px|left|Plan of the city of Pegu (Bago), 1568]]
After the 1565 rebellion by resettled Shans in Pegu, he faced no new rebellions for the next two years (1565–1567). Because the rebellion burned down major swaths of the capital, including the entire palace complex, he had the capital and the palace rebuilt. The new capital had 20 gates, each named after the vassal who built it.<ref name="Harvey" /> Each gate had a gilded two-tier ''[[pyatthat]]'' and gilded wooden doors.<ref name="mhyzw">{{Cite book |last=[[U Kala|Kala]] |first=U |title=Maha Yazawin |title-link=Maha Yazawin |date=1724 |publisher=Ya-Pyei Publishing |edition=2006, 4th printing |volume=1–3 |location=Yangon |language=Burmese}}</ref>

The newly rebuilt Kanbawzathadi Palace was officially opened on 16 March 1568, with every vassal ruler present. He even gave upgraded titles to four former kings living in Pegu: [[Mobye Narapati]] of Ava, [[Sithu Kyawhtin]] of Ava, [[Yun Bayin|Mekuti]] of Lan Na, and [[Maha Chakkraphat]] of Siam.<ref name="mhyzw" />
 
As a major seaport, the city was frequently visited by Europeans, among these, [[Gasparo Balbi]] and [[Ralph Fitch]] in the late 1500s. The Europeans often commented on its magnificence. Pegu also established maritime links with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] by 1545.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Casale |first=Giancarlo |title=The Ottoman Age of Exploration |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-537782-8 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195377828.001.0001}}</ref>

[[File:The king of PEgu recievs an envoy (17th century).jpg|left|thumb|278x278px|The king of Pegu receives an envoy (17th century)]]

The Portuguese conquest of Pegu, following the destruction caused by the kings of Tangot and Arrakan in 1599, was described by Manuel de Abreu Mousinho in the account called "Brief narrative telling the conquest of Pegu in eastern India made by the Portuguese in the time of the viceroy Aires de Saldanha, being captain [[Salvador Ribeiro de Sousa]], called Massinga, born in Guimarães, elected as their king by the natives in the year 1600", published by Fernão Mendes Pinto in the 18th century. The 1599 destruction of the city and the crumbling authority of Bayinnaung's successor [[Nanda Bayin]] saw the Toungoo dynasty flee their capital to [[Inwa|Ava]].

The capital was looted by the viceroy of [[Toungoo]], [[Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo]], and then burned by the viceroy of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] during the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1594–1605)]]. [[Anaukpetlun]] wanted to rebuild Hongsawadi and the glories of Bago, which had been deserted since Nanda Bayin had abandoned it. He was only able to build a temporary palace, however.<ref name="Damrong">{{Cite book |author=Prince Damrong Rajanubhab |title=Our Wars with the Burmese |date=2001 |publisher=White Lotus |isbn=974-7534-58-4 |location=Bangkok}}</ref>{{rp|151–162,191}}

The Burmese capital's return to Bago was short lived as the royal capital was once again relocated to [[Inwa|Ava]] in 1634 by the next king [[Thalun]] to focus on the core of the smaller Burmese empire.

===The fall of the Toungoo and Konbaung dynasty===

In 1740, the Mon revolted and founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]]. However, a [[Bamar people|Bamar]] king, [[Alaungpaya]], captured the city in May 1757.

Bago was rebuilt by King [[Bodawpaya]] (r.&nbsp;1782–1819), but by then the river had shifted course, cutting the city off from the sea. It never regained its previous importance. After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], the [[British Empire|British]] annexed Bago in 1852. In 1862, the province of [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]] was formed, and the capital moved to [[Yangon]]. The substantial differences between the colloquial and literary pronunciations, as with Burmese words, was a reason of the British corruption "Pegu".

In 1911, Hanthawaddy was described as a district in the [[Bago Region|Bago]] (or ''Pegu'') division of [[Lower Burma]]. It lay in the home district of [[Yangon]], from which the town was detached to make a separate district in 1880. It had an area of {{convert|3023|sqmi|km2}}, with a population of 48,411 in 1901, showing an increase of 22% in the past decade. Hanthawaddy and [[Hinthada]] were the two most densely populated districts in the province.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Hanthawaddy|volume=12|page=932}}</ref>

Hanthawaddy, as it was constituted in 1911, consisted of a vast plain stretching up from the sea between the mouth of the [[Irrawaddy River]] and the [[Pegu Range]]. Except the tract of land lying between the Pegu Range on the east and the [[Yangon River]], the country was intersected by numerous [[Creek (tidal)|tidal creek]]s, many of which were navigable by large boats and some by steamers. The headquarters of the district was in Rangoon, which was also the sub-divisional headquarters. The second sub-division had its headquarters at [[Insein Township|Insein]], where there were large railway works. Cultivation was almost wholly confined to rice, but there were many vegetable and fruit gardens.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Bago was severely damaged during earthquakes in [[1930 Bago earthquake|May]] and [[1930 Pyu earthquake|December]] 1930. The May earthquake killed at least 500 people and triggered a tsunami.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-05-05|title=On This Day: The 1930 Earthquake Which Flattened Bago|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/1930-earthquake-flattened-bago.html|access-date=2020-10-14|website=The Irrawaddy|language=en-US}}</ref>

The town of Bago is subdivided into 34 wards.<ref name=":0"/> On 9 April 2021, during the [[2021 Myanmar protests|Myanmar protests]], Bago became the site of the [[Bago massacre]], during which military forces killed at least 82 civilians following a protest crackdown.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-04-10|title=Myanmar coup: 'Dozens killed' in military crackdown in Bago|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56703416|access-date=2021-04-11}}</ref>

==Demographics==

As of 2019, the urban town has 179,505 people based on the [[General Administration Department]]'s estimates. 88.73% of the Township is [[Bamar]] with a significant [[Karen people|Karen]], Mon, [[Palaung people|Palaung]] and [[Burmese Indian]] population. [[Buddhists]] make up 94.2% of the city with [[Christianity]] being the second most populous at 4.2%. There are 749 monasteries, 92 nunneries and 134 stupas of various sizes including the tallest pagoda in Myanmar, the [[Shwemawdaw Pagoda]]. The city also has 9 churches, 6 mosques, 16 Hindu temples and 3 Chinese [[Mahayana]] temples. <ref name="mimu">{{cite report |author=Myanmar Information Management Unit |date=December 19, 2019 |title=Bago Myone Daethasaingyarachatlatmya|script-title=my:ပဲခူမြို့နယ် ဒေသဆိုင်ရာအချက်လက်များ|trans-title=Bago Township Regional Information |url=http://themimu.info/sites/themimu.info/files/documents/TspProfiles_GAD_Bago_2019_MMR.pdf |publisher=MIMU |access-date=February 7, 2024}}</ref>

Smaller factories and workshops within the city also create food products, plastics, electric meters, motors, wood products, tea and [[halwa]]. Bago also has a small, but thriving tourism industry with many tourists from nearby Yangon. The Bago Development Committee manages 11 markets around the city. 

There are no airports within the township, and the city is served mostly by [[Yangon International Airport]] but the proposed [[Hanthawaddy International Airport]] serving Yangon and Bago may be located within Bago Township.<ref name="SUNJIN">{{cite web |url=http://www.sunjin.co.kr/eng/p_over_part_view.asp?seq=1046&page=1&PCode=2 |title=Oversea Major Project |publisher=SUNJIN Engineering & Architecture |date= |accessdate=23 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> There are two rail lines that pass through Bago, [[Yangon–Mandalay Railway]] and [[Yangon–Mawlamyine Railway]].
