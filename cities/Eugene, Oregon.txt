==History==
===Indigenous presence===

The first people to settle in the Eugene area were the [[Kalapuya]]ns, also written Calapooia or Calapooya. They made "seasonal rounds," moving around the countryside to collect and preserve local foods, including acorns, the bulbs of the [[Sagittaria latifolia|wapato]] and [[Camassia|camas]] plants, and berries. They stored these foods in their permanent winter village. When crop activities waned, they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting, fishing, and trading.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/kalapuyans-seasonal-lifeways-tek-anthropolocene/ |title=Kalapuyans: Seasonal Lifeways, Tek, Anthropocene |date=November 8, 2016 |website=NDN History Research: Critical and Indigenous Anthropology |last1=Lewis, Ph.D |first1=David G. |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-date=April 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405172459/https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/kalapuyans-seasonal-lifeways-tek-anthropolocene/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The First Oregonians |date=2007 |publisher=Oregon Council for the Humanities |isbn=9781880377024 |edition=2nd |location=Portland, Oregon |pages=307–315 |last1=Berg |first1=Laura}}</ref> They were known as the Chifin Kalapuyans and called the Eugene area where they lived "Chifin", sometimes recorded as "Chafin" or "Chiffin".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/chafin-band-reservation-and-village-1855/ |title=Chafin Band Reservation and Village 1855 |date=May 23, 2016 |website=NDN History Research: Critical and Indigenous Anthropology |last1=Lewis, Ph.D. |first1=David G. |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-date=April 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405172422/https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/chafin-band-reservation-and-village-1855/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfield.k12.or.us/Page/738 |title=Chifin Native Youth Center |website=Springfield Public Schools |publisher=Springfield, Oregon, Public Schools |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-date=August 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825073907/https://www.springfield.k12.or.us/Page/738 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Other Kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within Eugene city limits. Pee-you or Mohawk Calapooians, Winefelly or Pleasant Hill Calapooians, and the Lungtum or Long Tom. They were close-neighbors to the Chifin, intermarried, and were political allies. Some authorities suggest the Brownsville Kalapuyans (Calapooia Kalapuyans) were related to the Pee-you. It is likely that since the Santiam had an alliance with the Brownsville Kalapuyans that the Santiam influence also went as far at Eugene.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/chifin-kalapuya-village/ |title=Chifin Kalapuya Village |last=Lewis, Ph.D. |first=David G. |date=December 8, 2014 |website=NDN History Research: Critical and Indigenous Anthropology |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=April 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405172505/https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/chifin-kalapuya-village/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to archeological evidence, the ancestors of the Kalapuyans may have been in Eugene for as long as 10,000 years.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Kalapuyans: A Sourcebook on the Indians of the Willamette Valley |last=Mackey, Ph.D. |first=Harold |publisher=Mission Mill Museum Association, Inc.and the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde |year=2004 |isbn=9780975348406 |location=Salem, Oregon, and Grand Ronde, Oregon |pages=1–2}}</ref> In the 1800s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement, first by French fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of American settlers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth-Century Oregon, 1812-1859 |last=Jette |first=Melinda Marie |publisher=Oregon State University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9780870715976 |location=Corvallis, Oregon}}</ref>

[[North American fur trade|French fur traders]] had settled seasonally in the Willamette Valley by the beginning of the 19th century. Their settlements were concentrated in the "French Prairie" community in Northern Marion County but may have extended south to the Eugene area. Having already developed relationships with Native communities through intermarriage and trade, they negotiated for land from the Kalapuyans. By 1828 to 1830 they and their Native wives began year-round occupation of the land, raising crops and tending animals. In this process, the mixed race families began to impact Native access to land, food supply, and traditional materials for trade and religious practices.<ref>{{Cite book |title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859 |last=Jette |first=Melinda Marie |publisher=Oregon State University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9780870715976 |location=Corvallis, Oregon |pages=12–61, p. 147}}</ref>

In July 1830, "intermittent fever" struck the lower Columbia region and a year later, the Willamette Valley. Natives traced the arrival of the disease, then new to the [[Pacific Northwest]], to the ''USS Owyhee'', captained by John Dominis. "Intermittent fever" is thought by researchers now to be [[malaria]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859 |last=Jette |first=Melinda Marie |publisher=Oregon State University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9780870715976 |location=Corvallis, Oregon |pages=61–69}}</ref> According to Robert T. Boyd, an anthropologist at Portland State University, the first three years of the epidemic, "probably constitute the single most important epidemiological event in the recorded history of what would eventually become the state of Oregon". In his book ''The Coming of the Spirit Pestilence'' Boyd reports there was a 92% population loss for the Kalapuyans between 1830 and 1841.<ref>{{Cite book |title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859 |last=Jette |first=Melinda Marie |publisher=Oregon State University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9780870715976 |location=Corvallis, Oregon |pages=65–67}}</ref> This catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of Kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the Valley. This balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of Anglo-American settlers, beginning in 1840 with 13 people and growing steadily each year until within 20 years more than 11,000 American settlers, including Eugene Skinner, had arrived.<ref>{{Cite book |title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859 |last=Jette |first=Melinda Marie |publisher=Oregon State University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9780870715976 |location=Corvallis, Oregon |page=139}}</ref>

As the demographic pressure from the settlers grew, the remaining Kalapuyans were forcibly removed to [[Indian reservation]]s. Though some Natives avoided transfer into the reservation, most were moved to the [[Grand Ronde Community|Grand Ronde reservation]] in 1856.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest |last=Ruby |first=Robert, MD, John A.

[[Eugene Skinner|Eugene Franklin Skinner]], after whom Eugene is named, arrived in the [[Willamette Valley]] in 1846 with 1,200 other settlers that year.

=== Educational institutions ===

The first major educational institution in the area was [[Columbia College (Oregon)|Columbia College]], founded a few years earlier than the University of Oregon. It fell victim to two major fires in four years, and after the second fire, the college decided not to rebuild again.<ref name="ohq 1955">{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=Perry D. |date=December 1955 |title=Columbia College 1856-60 |journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly |publisher=Oregon Historical Society |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=326–351 |jstor=20612220}}</ref> The part of south Eugene known as College Hill was the former location of Columbia College.

The town raised the initial funding to start a public university, which later became the [[University of Oregon]], with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning. In 1872, the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] passed a bill creating the University of Oregon as a state institution. Eugene bested the nearby town of [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] in the competition for the state university. In 1873, community member [[James Henry Dickey Henderson|J.H.D. Henderson]] donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2012/11/university_of_oregon_history_i.html |title=University of Oregon history in a nutshell, from campus historian |last1=Richard |first1=Terry |last2=O'Neal |first2=Jennifer |date=November 10, 2012 |website=oregonlive |language=en |access-date=September 19, 2019 |archive-date=December 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205062140/https://www.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2012/11/university_of_oregon_history_i.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The university first opened in 1876 with the regents electing the first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president.

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Oregon - Eugene - NARA - 68147382 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Eugene in 1925]]
Eugene grew rapidly throughout most of the twentieth century, with the exception being the early 1980s when a downturn in the timber industry caused high unemployment. By 1985, the industry had recovered and Eugene began to attract more high-tech industries, earning it the moniker the "Emerald Shire". In 2012, Eugene and the surrounding metro area was dubbed the [[Silicon shire]].

The first Nike shoe was used in 1972 during the US Olympic trials held in Eugene.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/inside-niketown-how-eugene-oregon-became-the-centre-of-the-latest-athletics-controversy-a6774861.html |title=How 'Niketown' became the centre of the latest athletics controversy |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Independent |language=en |access-date=April 19, 2020 |archive-date=June 5, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220605075018/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/inside-niketown-how-eugene-oregon-became-the-centre-of-the-latest-athletics-controversy-a6774861.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Activism ===
{{Main|Community activism in Eugene, Oregon}}
The 1970s saw an increase in community activism. Local activists stopped a proposed freeway and lobbied for the construction of the [[Washington Jefferson Park]] beneath the Washington-Jefferson Street Bridge. Community Councils soon began to form as a result of these efforts.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 3, 1978 |title=Tiny Neighborhood Fights For Its Life |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gq5VAAAAIBAJ&pg=4899,579812&dq |access-date=July 18, 2020 |archive-date=July 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200718193921/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gq5VAAAAIBAJ&pg=4899,579812&dq |url-status=live }}</ref> A notable impact of the turn to community-organized politics came with [[Eugene Local Measure 51]], a ballot measure in 1978 that repealed a gay rights ordinance approved by the Eugene City Council in 1977 that prohibited discrimination by sexual orientation. Eugene is also home to [[Beyond Toxics]], a nonprofit environmental justice organization founded in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beyond Toxics {{!}} Eugene, OR {{!}} Cause IQ |url=https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/beyond-toxics,931294227/ |access-date=January 22, 2022 |website=www.causeiq.com |archive-date=January 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220122024752/https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/beyond-toxics,931294227/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

One hotspot for protest activity since the 1990s has been the [[Whiteaker, Eugene, Oregon|Whiteaker]] district, located in the northwest of downtown Eugene. The Whiteaker is primarily a [[working-class]] neighborhood that has become a cultural hub, center of community and activism and home to alternative artists. It saw an increase of activity in the 1990s after many young people drawn to Eugene's political climate relocated there.<ref name="harpers.org">{{cite magazine |date=May 5, 2000 |title=Notes from Underground: Among the radicals of the Pacific Northwest |magazine=Harper's Magazine |volume=May 2000 |url=https://harpers.org/archive/2000/05/notes-from-underground/ |access-date=July 18, 2020 |last1=Samuels |first1=David |archive-date=July 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719121253/https://harpers.org/archive/2000/05/notes-from-underground/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Animal rights groups have had a heavy presence in the Whiteaker, and several [[vegan]] restaurants are located there.

==Geography==
[[File:Eugene skyline crop.jpg|thumb|upright|450px|alt=The flat-roofed buildings of downtown Eugene in front of Spencer Butte, a prominent forested hill|[[Spencer Butte]] can be seen from much of the city.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|43.74|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|43.72|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 12, 2012}}</ref> Eugene is at an elevation of {{convert|426|ft|0}}.

To the north of downtown is [[Skinner Butte]]. Northeast of the city are the [[Coburg Hills]]. [[Spencer Butte]] is a prominent landmark south of the city. [[Mount Pisgah (Lane County, Oregon)|Mount Pisgah]] is southeast of Eugene and includes the [[Mount Pisgah Arboretum]] and the  [[Howard Buford Recreation Area]], a Lane County Park. Eugene is surrounded by foothills and forests to the south, east, and west, while to the north the land levels out into the Willamette Valley and consists of mostly farmland.

The [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[McKenzie River (Oregon)|McKenzie]] Rivers run through Eugene and its neighboring city, [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]]. Another important stream is [[Amazon Creek]], whose headwaters are near Spencer Butte. The creek discharges into the [[Long Tom River]] north [[Fern Ridge Reservoir]], maintained for winter flood control by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. The [[Eugene Yacht Club]] hosts a sailing school and sailing regattas at Fern Ridge during summer months.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eugeneyachtclub.org/ |title=Eugene Yacht Club at Fern Ridge Lake |date=2014 |access-date=August 10, 2014 |website=Eugene Yacht Club |archive-date=July 27, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727055600/http://eugeneyachtclub.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The River Road and Santa Clara sections, which make up the northwestern part of the city, are within the urban growth boundary and generally perceived as part of Eugene, but are largely outside of the city limits.

=== Climate ===
Like the rest of the [[Willamette Valley]], Eugene lies in the [[Marine west coast|Marine West Coast]] climate zone, with [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] characteristics. Under the Köppen climate classification scheme, Eugene has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csb''). Temperatures can vary from cool to warm, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Spring and fall are also moist seasons, with light rain falling for long periods. The average rainfall is {{convert|40.83|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, with the wettest "rain year" being from July 1973 to June 1974 with {{convert|75.59|in|mm|1}} and the driest from July 2000 to June 2001 with {{convert|20.40|in|mm|1}}.<ref name="NOAA" /> Measurements taken by NOAA over the past four decades have indicated a significant decline in average annual precipitation. From 1981 to 2010 inclusive, the reported annual average precipitation was {{convert|46.1|in|mm|sigfig=3}},<ref>Precipitation figures based on measurements taken at EUG Mahlon Sweet Airport.</ref><ref name="ncei.noaa.gov">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/us-climate-normals/#dataset=normals-annualseasonal&timeframe=15&station=USW00024221 |title=NOAA NCEI U.S. Climate Normals Quick Access |access-date=September 29, 2022 |archive-date=May 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505115421/https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/us-climate-normals/#dataset=normals-annualseasonal&timeframe=15&station=USW00024221 |url-status=live }}</ref> but for the thirty-year period ending in 2020, the annual average had declined {{convert|5.27|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, to {{convert|40.83|in|mm|sigfig=3}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/us-climate-normals/#dataset=normals-annualseasonal&timeframe=30&station=USW00024221 |title=NOAA NCEI U.S. Climate Normals Quick Access |access-date=September 29, 2022 |archive-date=May 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505115421/https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/us-climate-normals/#dataset=normals-annualseasonal&timeframe=30&station=USW00024221 |url-status=live }}</ref> The figures from the second half of that period, or 2006 - 2020 inclusive, pointed to a further decline of more than {{convert|4|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, down to an annual average of {{convert|36.58|in|mm|sigfig=3}}.<ref name="ncei.noaa.gov"/>

Winter snowfall does occur, but it is sporadic and rarely accumulates in large amounts: the normal seasonal amount is {{convert|4.9|in|cm}}, but the median is zero.<ref name="NOAA" /> The record snowfall was {{convert|41.7|in|cm}} of accumulation due to a [[pineapple express]] on January 25–29, 1969.<ref name="NOAA" /> Ice storms, like snowfall, are rare, but occur sporadically.

The hottest months are July and August, with a normal monthly mean temperature of {{convert|67.8|to|67.9|°F|°C|1}}, with an average of 16&nbsp;days per year reaching {{convert|90|F|C}}. The coolest month is December, with a mean temperature of {{convert|40.6|°F|1}}, and there are 52 mornings per year with a low at or below freezing, and 2 afternoons with highs not exceeding the freezing mark.<ref name="NOAA" /> The coldest daytime high of the year averages {{convert|32|F|C}}, reaching the freezing point.<ref name="NOAA" />

In 2005, the city council unanimously approved a new slogan for the city: "World's Greatest City for the Arts & Outdoors". While Eugene has a vibrant arts community for a city its size, and is well situated near many outdoor opportunities, this slogan was frequently criticized by locals as embarrassing and ludicrous.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dietz |first=Diane |date=December 21, 2006 |title=Not the World's Greatest Slogan?

All vendors must create or grow all their own products. The market reappears as the "Holiday Market" between Thanksgiving and New Year's in the Lane County Events Center at the fairgrounds.

===Community===
Eugene is noted for its "community inventiveness." Many U.S. trends in community development originated in Eugene. The University of Oregon's participatory [[planning]] process, known as [[The Oregon Experiment]], was the result of student protests in the early 1970s. The book of the same name is a major document in modern enlightenment thinking in planning and architectural circles. The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by [[Christopher Alexander]], whose works also directly inspired the creation of the [[Wiki]]. Some research for the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', which inspired the [[Design Patterns]] movement and [[Extreme Programming]], was done by Alexander in Eugene. Not coincidentally, those engineering movements also had origins here. Decades after its publication, ''A Pattern Language'' is still one of the best-selling books on urban design.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Levinson |first1=David M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWuTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA232 |title=Place and Plexus: Metropolitan Land Use and Transport |last2=Krizek |first2=Kevin J. |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2008 |isbn=9781135974565 |page=232 |access-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Eugene was packed with cooperative and community projects. It still has small natural food stores in many neighborhoods, some of the oldest student cooperatives in the country, and alternative schools have been part of the school district since 1971. The old Grower's Market, downtown near the [[Amtrak]] depot, is the only food cooperative in the U.S. with no employees. It is possible to see Eugene's trend-setting non-profit tendencies in much newer projects, such as [[Square One Villages]] and the [[Center for Appropriate Transport]]. In 2006, an initiative began to create a tenant-run development process for downtown Eugene.

The City of Eugene has an active Neighborhood Program. Several neighborhoods are known for their green activism. Friendly Neighborhood has a highly popular neighborhood garden established on the right of way of a street never built. There are a number of community gardens on public property. Amazon Neighborhood has a former church turned into a community center. Whiteaker hosts a housing co-op that dates from the early 1970s that has re-purposed both their parking lots into food production and play space. An unusual eco-village with natural building techniques and large shared garden can be found in Jefferson Westside neighborhood. A several block area in the River Road Neighborhood is known as a [[permaculture]] hotspot with an increasing number of suburban homes trading grass for garden, installing rain water catchment systems, food producing landscapes and solar retrofits. Several sites have planted gardens by removing driveways. Citizen volunteers are working with the City of Eugene to restore a 65-tree [[hazelnut|filbert]] grove on public property. There are deepening social and economic networks in the neighborhood.

Eugene also has growing [[reggae]] and street-performing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[jug band]] scenes. Multi-genre act the [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]] became a prominent figure in Eugene's music scene and became the [[house band]] at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall. In the late 1990s, their contributions to the [[swing revival]] movement propelled them to national stardom. Rock band [[Floater (band)|Floater]] originated in Eugene as did the Robert Cray blues band. Doom metal band [[Yob (band)|YOB]] is among the leaders of the Eugene heavy music scene.

The Eugene area has been used as a filming location for several Hollywood films, most famously for 1978's ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', which was also filmed in nearby [[Cottage Grove, Oregon|Cottage Grove]]. [[John Belushi]] had the idea for the film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' during filming of ''Animal House'' when he happened to meet [[Curtis Salgado]] at what was then the Eugene Hotel.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Original Blues Brother: Curtis Salgado |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~pringle/bluesbros/article.html |access-date=November 13, 2012 |publisher=Csse.monash.edu.au |archive-date=September 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929065329/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~pringle/bluesbros/article.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

''[[Getting Straight]]'', starring [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Candice Bergen]], was filmed at [[Lane Community College]] in 1969.

Two track and field movies about the life of [[Steve Prefontaine]], ''[[Prefontaine (film)|Prefontaine]]'' and ''[[Without Limits]]'', were released within a year of each other in 1997–1998. [[Kenny Moore (runner)|Kenny Moore]], Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in ''Prefontaine'', co-wrote the screenplay for ''Without Limits''. ''Prefontaine'' was filmed in Washington because the ''Without Limits'' production bought out [[Hayward Field]] for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steve Prefontaine and Running Legends |url=http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/running/history/pre-legends/ |access-date=March 11, 2013 |publisher=Eugene Cascades & Coast |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203040335/http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/running/history/pre-legends/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of [[Bill Bowerman]], played in ''Without Limits'' by [[Donald Sutherland]] back in Eugene 20 years after he had appeared in ''Animal House''.

[[File:Hendricks Park.jpg|thumb|[[Hendricks Park]]]]
Spencer Butte Park at the southern edge of town provides access to Spencer Butte, a dominant feature of Eugene's skyline. [[Hendricks Park]], situated on a knoll to the east of downtown, is known for its [[rhododendron]] garden and nearby memorial to Steve Prefontaine, known as [[Steve Prefontaine#Death|Pre's Rock]], where the legendary University of Oregon runner was killed in an auto accident. [[Alton Baker Park]], next to the Willamette River, contains Pre's Trail. Also next to the Willamette are Skinner Butte Park<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eugene-or.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/55 |title=City Facilities - Skinner Butte Park |date=2014 |access-date=August 24, 2014 |website=Eugene, OR |archive-date=August 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114931/https://www.eugene-or.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/55 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the Owen Memorial Rose Garden, which contains more than 4,500 roses of over 400 varieties,<ref>{{cite web |title=Owen Rose Garden |url=http://www.eugene-or.gov/facilities.aspx?RID=124&Page=detail |publisher=City of Eugene |access-date=December 31, 2012 |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025040936/http://eugene-or.gov/Facilities.aspx?Page=detail&RID=124 |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as the 150-year-old [[Black Tartarian]] Cherry tree,<ref>{{cite web |title=Black Tartarian Cherry at Owen Memorial Rose Garden |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4KCG |publisher=Waymark.com |access-date=February 11, 2009 |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606202917/http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4KCG |url-status=live }}</ref> an [[Oregon Heritage Tree]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Oregon Heritage Trees |url=http://ortravelexperience.com/oregon-heritage-trees/ |publisher=Oregon Travel Experience |access-date=January 6, 2012 |archive-date=April 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414072740/http://ortravelexperience.com/oregon-heritage-trees/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city of Eugene maintains an [[urban forest]]. The University of Oregon campus is an [[arboretum]], with over 500 species of trees. The city operates and maintains scenic hiking trails that pass through and across the ridges of a cluster of hills in the southern portion of the city, on the fringe of residential neighborhoods. Some trails allow biking, and others are for hikers and runners only.

The nearest ski resort, [[Willamette Pass ski area|Willamette Pass]], is one hour from Eugene by car. On the way, along [[Oregon Route 58]], are several reservoirs and lakes, the Oakridge [[mountain biking|mountain bike]] trails, [[hot spring]]s, and waterfalls within [[Willamette National Forest]]. Eugene residents also frequent the [[Hoodoo (ski area)|Hoodoo]] and [[Mt. Bachelor ski area|Mount Bachelor]] ski resorts. The [[Three Sisters Wilderness]], the [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area]], and [[Smith Rock State Park|Smith Rock]] are just a short drive away.

== Government ==
In 1944, Eugene adopted a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government, replacing the day-to-day management of city affairs by the part-time mayor and volunteer [[city council]] with a full-time professional [[city manager]]. The subsequent history of Eugene city government has largely been one of the dynamics—often contentious—between the city manager, the mayor and city council.

According to statute, all Eugene and Lane County elections are officially non-partisan, with a primary containing all candidates in May. If a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote in the primary, they win the election outright, otherwise the top two candidates face off in a November runoff. This allows candidates to win seats during the lower-turnout primary election.

The mayor of Eugene is [[Lucy Vinis]], who has been in office since winning the popular vote in May 2016, and who was re-elected in May 2020. [[List of mayors of Eugene, Oregon|Recent mayors]] include Edwin Cone (1958–69), Les Anderson (1969–77) Gus Keller (1977–84), Brian Obie (1985–88), Jeff Miller (1989–92), [[Ruth Bascom]] (1993–96), [[Jim Torrey]] (1997–2004) and [[Kitty Piercy]] (2005–2017).

Eugene used to have an ordinance which prohibited car horn usage for non-driving purposes. After several residents were cited for this offense during the anti-Gulf War demonstrations in January 1991, the city was taken to court and in 1992 the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] overturned the ordinance, finding it unconstitutionally vague.<ref>{{cite web |date=November 4, 1992 |title=City of Eugene v.

Various offices of city government became tenants in eight other buildings.

===Politics===

Being the largest city by far in Lane County, Eugene's voters almost always decide the county's partisan tilt. While Eugene has historically been a counter-culture-heavy and left-leaning college town, the county's partisan leanings have intensified in recent decades, mirroring the general polarization of Oregon voters along urban (pro-Democratic) and rural (pro-Republican) lines.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 12, 2019 |title=The urban-rural divide in Oregon has become more pronounced |url=https://www.registerguard.com/news/20190212/urban-rural-divide-in-oregon-has-become-more-pronounced |access-date=August 1, 2020 |archive-date=July 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731032051/https://www.registerguard.com/news/20190212/urban-rural-divide-in-oregon-has-become-more-pronounced |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lane County voted for [[Bernie Sanders]] over eventual 2016 nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] by 60.6-38.1%, and Eugene offered Sanders an even larger share of its vote.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 17, 2016 |title=Lane County, Oregon Primary Election May 17, 2016 OFFICIAL FINAL RESULTS |url=http://apps.lanecounty.org/Elections/Document.ashx?id=680 |access-date=August 1, 2020 |archive-date=September 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230914200426/https://apps.lanecounty.org/Elections/Document.ashx?id=680 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Cycling====
Cycling is popular in Eugene and many people commute via bicycle. Summertime events and festivals frequently have valet bicycle parking corrals that are often filled to capacity by three hundred or more bikes. Many people commute to work by bicycle every month of the year. PeaceHealth Rides, a bike share system formerly operated by Uber subsidiary JUMP, and currently operated by non-profit Cascadia Mobility, offers 300 city-owned bicycles available to the public for a small fee. Bike trails take commuting and recreational bikers along the Willamette River past a scenic rose garden, along Amazon Creek, through the downtown, and through the University of Oregon campus. Eugene is close to many popular mountain bike trails, and Disciples of Dirt is the local mountain bike club that organizes group rides and promotes trail stewardship.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stewart |first=Jade |date=May 17, 2019 |title=Disciples of Dirt makes trailwork and mountain biking a blast |url=https://www.dailyemerald.com/arts-culture/disciples-of-dirt-makes-trailwork-and-mountain-biking-a-blast/article_895939b8-7552-11e9-9afb-13e1ed1a01bd.html |access-date=January 27, 2021 |website=Daily Emerald |language=en |archive-date=April 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427005929/https://www.dailyemerald.com/arts-culture/disciples-of-dirt-makes-trailwork-and-mountain-biking-a-blast/article_895939b8-7552-11e9-9afb-13e1ed1a01bd.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Highways====
Highways traveling within and through Eugene include:
*[[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]]: Interstate 5 forms much of the eastern city limit, acting as an effective, though unofficial boundary between Eugene and Springfield. To the north, I-5 leads to the Willamette Valley and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. To the south, I-5 leads to [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]], and the southwestern portion of the state. In full, Interstate 5 continues north to the Canada–US border at Blaine, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia and extends south to the Mexico–US border at Tijuana and San Diego.
*[[Oregon Route 126|Officer Chris Kilcullen Memorial Highway]]: Oregon Route 126 is routed along the Eugene-Springfield Highway, a limited-access freeway. The Eugene portion of this highway begins at an interchange with Interstate 5 and ends {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} west at a freeway terminus. This portion of Oregon Route 126 is also signed Interstate 105, a spur route of Interstate 5. Oregon Route 126 continues west, a portion shared with Oregon Route 99, and continues west to [[Florence, Oregon|Florence]]. Eastward, Oregon Route 126 crosses the Cascades and leads to central and eastern Oregon.
*[[Oregon Route 569|Randy Papé Beltline]]: Beltline is a limited-access freeway which runs along the northern and western edges of incorporated Eugene.
*[[Delta Highway (Eugene, Oregon)|Delta Highway]]: The Delta Highway forms a connector of less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} between Interstate 105 and Beltline Highway.
*[[Oregon Route 99]]: Oregon Route 99 forks off Interstate 5 south of Eugene, and forms a major surface artery in Eugene. It continues north into the Willamette valley, parallel to I-5. It is sometimes called the "scenic route" since it has a great view of the Coast Range and also stretches through many scenic farmlands of the Willamette Valley.

===Utilities===
Eugene is the home of Oregon's largest publicly owned [[electric utility|water and power utility]], the [[Eugene Water & Electric Board]] (EWEB).
