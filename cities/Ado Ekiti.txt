'''Ado Ekiti''' is the capital city of [[Ekiti State, Nigeria]]. It is the [[Headquarters|headquarter]] of the Ekiti central senatorial district, [[Points of the compass|southwest]], Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ado-Ekiti {{!}} Location, Facts, & History|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ado-Ekiti|access-date=2021-06-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
Ado Ekiti is an ancient city, founded by Ewi Awamaro the son of Biritikolu. Awamaro (the restless one) left [[Ile-Ife]] with his father Ewi Apa Biritikolu and his uncle Oranmiyan to Ita Orogun and Benin respectively after staying briefly with Oloba in Oba-Ile in present-day Akure.

Both Oranmiyan (Oba of Benin) and Biritikolu first settled in Benin forests before disputes among their people led them to separate and Biritikolu sought a new home westward at Utamodi (Oke Papa). Ewi Biritikolu and one of his sons reigned there. It was Ewi Awamaro who migrated to Ilesun (Present day Ado-Ekiti) after staying briefly at Udoani [[Idoani|(Ido Ani)]] and Agbado during the long migration. When Ewi Awamaro left Agbado, some elders remained behind to rest and gave the settlement the name Agba Ado (Elders' Camp) – Agbado-Ekiti as the town is known today.

==Population and demographics==
The population in 2006 was 308,621. The people of Ado Ekiti are mainly of the Ekiti sub-ethnic group of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2016-11-24|title=Ado Ekiti {{!}} Hometown.ng|url=https://hometown.ng/listing-item/ado-ekiti/|access-date=2021-06-25|language=en-US}}</ref>
