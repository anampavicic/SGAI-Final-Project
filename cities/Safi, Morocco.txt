'''Safi''' or '''Asfi''' ({{langx|ar|آسفي|ʾāsafī}}) is a city in western [[Morocco]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is the capital of [[Safi Province|Asfi Province]]. It recorded a population of 308,508 in the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name=census2014/> The city was occupied by the [[Portuguese Empire]] from 1488 to 1541, was the center of Morocco's [[weaving]] industry, and became a ''fortaleza'' of the Portuguese Crown in 1508.<ref>{{cite book | title = A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668 | last = Newitt | first = Malyn | publisher = Routledge | date = November 5, 2004 | page = 66 | isbn = 9781134553044 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HDODAgAAQBAJ }}</ref> Safi is the main fishing port for the country's [[sardine]] industry, and also exports [[phosphate]]s, textiles and [[Pottery|ceramics]]. During the [[Second World War]], Safi was the site of [[Operation Blackstone]], one of the landing sites for [[Operation Torch]].

==Etymology==
11th-century geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] gave an explanation to the origin the name "Asafi" as he linked it to the Arabic word "Asaf" (regret); Asafi (my regret). He based this claim on a strange story about some sailors from [[al-Andalus]] who sailed to discover the other end of the Atlantic Ocean but got lost and landed on some island where the natives captured them and sent them back on their ships blindfolded. The ships eventually ended on the shores of "Safi" and locals helped the lost sailors and told them that they were two months away from their native land [[al-Andalus]]. Upon hearing this one of the sailors responded by saying: "Wa asafi" (Oh my regret). [[Al-Idrisi]] wrote that from that time the city carried the name "Asafi".<ref>{{cite book|last=Arabian American Oil Company, Aramco Services Company, Saudi Aramco|title=Aramco world, Volumes 42-43|year=1991|publisher=Aramco|pages=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkkgAQAAMAAJ}}</ref>

==History==
According to historians Henri Basset and Robert Ricard, Safi was not a very ancient city.<ref name=":0523">{{EI2|title=Aṣfī|volume=1|pages=688-689|last1=Basset|first1=Henri|last2=Ricard|first2=Robert}}</ref> It was mentioned in the writings of [[al-Bakri]] in the 11th century and of [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]] in the 12th century.<ref name=":0523" /> According to Moroccan historian Mohammed al-Kanuni, Safi can be identified with the ancient [[Thymiaterium]] or Carcunticus that was founded by the [[Carthago|Carthaginian]] admiral [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno]] during his [[Periplus of Hanno|Periplus]], as related by [[Pliny the Elder]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornell |first=Vincent J. |url=https://archive.org/details/vincent-cornell-realm-moroccan-sufism/page/n185/mode/2up |title=Realm of the Saint: Power and Authority in Moroccan Sufism |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-292-78970-8 |pages=326 (see note 80) |language=en}}</ref>

Al-Idrisi mentions Safi as a busy port in the 12th century.<ref name=":0523" /> At this time it served as a port for [[Marrakesh]], the capital of the [[Almoravids]] and the subsequent [[Almohads]], replacing the port of Ribat Kuz (present-day Souira Kedima) that had served as the main port for [[Aghmat]] in the previous century.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKiW0HDhAcoC&pg=PA48 |title=Itinéraire culturel des Almoravides et des Almohades: Maghreb et Péninsule ibérique |date= |publisher=Fundación El Legado Andalusí |year=1999 |isbn=978-84-930615-1-7 |pages=48 |language=fr}}</ref>

The city was under [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] rule from 1488 to 1541; it is believed that they abandoned it to the [[Saadians]] (who were at war with them), since the city proved difficult to defend from land attacks. The Portuguese fortress built to protect the city is still there today.

After 1541, the city played a major role in [[Morocco]] as one of the safest and biggest [[seaports]] in the country. Many ambassadors to the [[Saadian]] and [[Alaouite]] kings during the 16th–18th centuries came to Morocco via Safi; its proximity to [[Marrakech]], then capital of Morocco, helped expand the maritime trade in the city.<br />
[[Louis De Chénier]], consul of the French court in Morocco in 1767, reported that the city was the only usable seaport at the time.
 
A [[French Navy]] captive, [[Bidé de Maurville]], who wrote the account of his stay in [[Morocco]] in his 1765 book ''Relations de l'affaire de Larache'', reported the presence of an important number of foreign trading houses in the city: Dutch, Danish, British and French.

After the Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] built the city of [[Essaouira|Mogador]] (modern-day Essaouira), he banned foreign trade in all Moroccan ports except in his newly built city. Consequently, Safi stopped playing a leading role in the Moroccan trade.

Safi's patron saint is [[Abu Mohammed Salih]].

In 1942 as part of [[Operation Torch]], American forces attacked Safi in [[Operation Blackstone]]. During November 8-10, 1942 the Americans took control over Safi and its port and took relatively few casualties compared to the other operations at [[Casablanca]] and at [[Mehdya, Morocco|Port Mehdia]].

== Climate ==
Safi has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh'').

==Population==
The inhabitants are composed of Berber and Arab descendants.

The [[Berbers|Berber]] origin is related to:
* The Berbers who lived in the region before the foundation of the city.
* The Berbers who came later from the Sous plains, south of the region.

The [[Arab]] origin is related to two tribes:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safi-ville.com/population.php|title=Safi ville.com|first=Allal|last=MENNIS|website=www.safi-ville.com}}</ref>
* Abda: They descend from [[Banu Hilal]] and have hugtalled in the region in the twelfth century and spawned : ''Bhatra'' and ''Rabiaa''.
* Ahmar: They descend from [[Maqil]].

Safi also used to have a large [[Jewish]] community, more than 20% of the population,{{Citation needed|reason=statistics speculation without reference|date=September 2019}} many of whom subsequently emigrated to [[France]], [[Canada]] and [[Israel]].

==Economy==
[[File:Articles de poterie de la ville de Safi Maroc.JPG|thumb|250px|Pottery from Safi]]
In the early 20th century, the Moroccan potter [[Boujemâa Lamali]] established a pottery school in Safi, supported by the colonial administration.  Since then pottery has been a mainstay of Safi's economy. Prior to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] there were 2,000 registered artisans working in the city's 212 workshops, and thousands more unregistered artisans.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0013-0613| title = Why are Morocco's famed artisans paving roads in the desert?| newspaper = The Economist| date = 2021-06-12|url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/06/12/why-are-moroccos-famed-artisans-paving-roads-in-the-desert|access-date=2021-06-13}}</ref>

==Sport==
[[Association football|Football]] and [[rugby union|rugby]] are popular sports in Safi. The local football team [[Olympic Safi]] have been competing in Morocco's premier football division, [[Botola]], since 2004.<br />
The [[Rugby Union]] team of the same name is one of Morocco's best, having won the "Coupe du Trône" several times. There also is a little Tennis Sport Club with a couple of fields (following the high road, beyond the Colline des Poitiers).

==European cemetery==
There is an abandoned European cemetery in Safi. Some of the marble decorations have been stolen from the richest tombs, including: Russian, Portuguese, Spanish (e.g. the Do Carmo family), Italian (e.g. the Bormioli family), French (e.g., the Chanel family), German and other European nationals. Some engravings identifying or memorializing the deceased have also been stolen. Although there are 19th century tombs present, most are of pre-independence  (1956) 20th century origin.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}
