'''Minglanilla''', officially the '''Municipality of Minglanilla''' ({{lang-ceb|Lungsod sa Minglanilla}}; {{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Minglanilla}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Cebu]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 151,002 people.{{PH census|current}}

Minglanilla is bordered to the north by the City of [[Talisay City, Cebu|Talisay]], to the west is the city of [[Toledo City, Cebu|Toledo]], to the east is the [[Cebu Strait]], and to the south is the city of [[Naga, Cebu|Naga]].

Minglanilla lies within [[Metro Cebu]]. It is known as the "Sugat Capital of the South". (''Sugat'' in Cebuano means meeting.) A big event in Minglanilla is the ''Sugat'', which attracts not people from adjacent towns as well as from Cebu city and further afield. On [[Holy Saturday|Black Saturday]] night, a public dance is held at the church plaza to witness the re{{nbhyph}}enactment of the "meeting" of the risen Christ and his mother. Their images, borne on richly decorated ''carrozas'', meet amidst joyous songs and the presence of child angels suspended by wires. The ''Kabanhawan'' (Cebuano for "Resurrection") festival is held annually on Easter Sunday.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2022}}
Father Sanchez, Minglanilla's first parish priest, is credited as the founder of the town in 1858. The roads and bridges were built by the same Fr. Sanchez together with Fr. Magaz. There were a number of ''capitanes'' who headed the town during the Spanish era. The first capitan was Hilario Castañares. During the American regime the first was Canuto Larrobis. The first elected municipal mayor was Gregorio de la Calzada.

Buat was the former name of Minglanilla. It was the place where early settlers dried (''buad/buat'') their sea catches. But in 1858, it was renamed by Fr. Sanchez after a municipality called [[Minglanilla, Cuenca|''Minglanilla'']] in [[Castilla–La Mancha]], Spain.

The town suffered setbacks, among them during the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1898 when ''insurrectos'' burned down its municipal building and looted many houses. This event is remembered by a street named 18 de Julio (July 18). In 1942, its poblacion was razed to the ground by the Japanese in retaliation for the presence of the guerrillas in the town.

==Economy==
{{PH poverty incidence}}
Minglanilla is a part of the [[Metro Cebu|Cebu metropolitan area]].

It is primarily a residential town, with most of its population commuting to [[Cebu City]] for work. Owing to its close location to [[Cebu City]], which is only {{convert|15|km|mi}} away from the municipality, it hosts many [[gated community|subdivisions]].

Prior to its [[suburbanization]], Minglanilla's primary industry were agriculture and fishing. However, since the 2000s, when the municipality saw developments trickle down from Cebu City due to the city's own [[Ceboom|economic boom]], the municipality has shifted into having a more service-driven economy.

[[Anjo World Theme Park]] is located in Barangay Calajo-an. It is the first [[amusement park]] in [[Cebu]], and is located in the larger Belmont One development, which hosts a supermarket, a hardware, restaurants, among other retail components, also located within Barangay Calajo-an.<ref>{{ cite news |title=Be part of Cebu's first: Belmont One announces its groundbreaking ceremony |url=https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/193522/part-cebus-first-belmont-one-announces-groundbreaking-ceremony |work=[[Cebu Daily News]] |date=September 11, 2018 |access-date=July 26, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite news |last=Contratista |first=Ferliza |title=First theme park to boost Minglanilla's tourism |url=https://pia.gov.ph/news/articles/1016600 |work=[[Philippine Information Agency]] |date=January 3, 2019 |access-date=July 26, 2020 }}</ref>

The Minglanilla Techno-Business Park is a {{convert|100|ha|sqkm}} development which will be built on [[reclaimed land]] along the coast of the municipality's Tulay and Calajo-an barangays. It is envisioned primarily to host [[light industries]], but also to other [[mixed-use]] developments as well, and is scheduled for completion by 2024.<ref>{{ cite news |last=Almazan |first=Faye |title=Cebu Landmasters project secures ECC from DENR |url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/07/25/business/companies/cebu-landmasters-project-secures-ecc-from-denr/745607/ |work=[[Manila Times]] |date=July 25, 2020 |access-date=July 26, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite news |title=Minglanilla reclamation gets approval from PRA |url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1897473/Cebu/Business/Minglanilla-reclamation-gets-approval-from-PRA |work=[[SunStar Cebu]] |date=June 11, 2021 |access-date=June 12, 2021 }}</ref>

===Festivals===
*'''Sugat–Kabanhawan festival ('''''Easter Feast of Resurrection)''
: In its devotion to the celebration of Christ's resurrection, the municipality of Minglanilla has long held the distinction of being the "Sugat Capital of the south". Annually held every [[Easter Sunday]], the occasion primarily focuses on the re{{nbhyph}}enactment of the meeting of the Risen Christ and the Sorrowful Mother – followed by a string of activities and events scheduled to take place throughout the day. As one of the biggest annually celebrated occasions of the municipality, the festival takes a direct translation in celebrating Christ's resurrection, with street dancing, a wide assortment of day games, and entertainment features. Essentially a socio-religious event, celebrations have played the role of host to a diverse range of organized contests, competitions, and games, including a [[carabao]] race, a Burda-making contest (''Burda'' = embroidery), and a mud volleyball tournament. Easter-egg hunts also are part of Sugat-Kabanhawan festivals, just as the street dancing and the ritual showdown have become mainstay staples of the festival's overall program flow.
