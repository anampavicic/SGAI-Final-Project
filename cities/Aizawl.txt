==Etymology==
The word ''Aizawl'' is a combination of two [[Mizo people|Mizo]] words: "ai" meaning "[[cardamom]]" and "zawl" meaning "flatland" or "plain." Therefore, "Aizawl" could roughly translate to "the field of cardamom." This name may have historical significance or could refer to the characteristics of the area before urbanisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mizoramtourism.com/place-to-visit/1|title=Mizoram Tourism}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-colonialism (before 1889)===
In 1871–72, Kalkhama (<small>recorded by the British as Kalkhom</small>), a [[Mizo people|Mizo]] Chief, exhibited disorderly behavior, prompting the British to establish an outpost. This outpost, initially founded by Suakpuilala, the Chief of [[Reiek]], later evolved into ''Aizawl'' village. Situated a mere 14 kilometress from [[Sairang]] and accessible via flat-bottomed boats, it served as a strategic location, with the Li Bial stream.<ref>{{cite book|author=K. C. Kabra|title=Economic Growth of Mizoram: Role of Business & Industry|year=2008|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PcdaYllHNUC&q=lunglei+economy&pg=PA75|isbn=9788180695186}}</ref>

===Colonial Aijal (1889-1948)===
In 1889, Officer Dally of the [[Assam Police]], accompanied by 400 men, arrived in Aizawl village to assist Colonel Skinner's troops during a [[British rule in the Lushai Hills|British military operation]] against the Mizo natives. Aizawl was subsequently chosen as the site for a fortified post on Dally's recommendation, leading Colonel Skinner to oversee its construction. The troops erected stockades and other essential structures, establishing a significant military presence in the area. In the same year, Fort Aijal was established, a small village that became the capital of British administration in [[British rule in the Lushai Hills|North Lushai Hills]].<ref name="The Making of Aijal">{{cite web|url=http://aizawl.nic.in/makingofaijal.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112023258/http://aizawl.nic.in/makingofaijal.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Making of Aijal|archivedate=12 November 2013}}</ref>

Aijal was formally established on 25 February 1890 as '''Fort Aijal'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mizoramtourism.com/place-to-visit/1|title=Mizoram Tourism|accessdate=16 February 2024}}</ref>

Aizawl swiftly emerged as the administrative and religious hub for the Mizos, following the establishment of the Welsh Mission Society headquarters in the city. This led to a surge in population as Aizawl Bazar evolved into the primary commercial center of the [[British rule in the Lushai Hills|Lushai Hills region]].<ref name="The Making of Aijal"/>

===Contemporary Aizawl (1948-present)===
====Capital of [[Mizo District]], Assam, India (1948-1972)====
The once modest village, situated on a level hilltop, underwent rapid expansion, transforming into a rugged and uneven settlement. The intensification of the [[Mautam|Mautam famine]] in the late 1950s prompted an influx of people seeking sustenance and opportunities, further fueling Aizawl's growth. Nearby villages like Chaltlang and Durtlang soon became absorbed into the expanding urban landscape, marking the transition of Aizawl into a modern cityscape by the early 1960s.<ref name="themizos.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.themizos.com/2021/10/the-beautiful-hill-top-city-of-aizawl.html|title=The Beautiful Hill Top City of Aizawl|date=26 October 2021 }}</ref>

====1966 Mizo National Front Uprising====
The expansion of Aizawl came to an abrupt halt in the mid-1960s due to the turmoil caused by the [[Mizo National Front uprising|Mizo Independence Movement]], spearheaded by the [[Mizo National Front]] (MNF), which engaged in open conflict with the [[Government of India]]. However, a pivotal and tragic event unfolded in Aizawl in March 1966, marking a dark chapter in its history. 

In an effort to suppress the MNF's advances, on March 5-6th, the Government of India launched a devastating bombardment of Aizawl and its surrounding areas, resulting in significant loss of life.<ref name="The Mizo Uprising: Assam Assembly Debates on the Mizo Movement, 1966-1971">{{cite book

==== Capital of Mizoram Union Territory (1972-1987)====
Aizawl continued to be the capital of [[Union Territory of Mizoram|Mizoram]] after gaining the status of Union Territory. The UT status provided opportunities for economic growth and development in Aizawl. The city emerged as a key commercial and trade centre in the region, with [[Burmese people|Burmese]] ethnic [[Chin people|Chin]] immigrants seeking better job opportunities in Aizawl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mizzima.com/article/chin-refugees-myanmar-receive-mixed-welcome-india|title=Chin Refugees Myanmar Receive Mixed Welcome india}}</ref>

==== Capital of State of Mizoram (1987-present)====
[[File:Aizawl.jpg|thumb|Aizawl in the 2000s]]
Statehood provided Aizawl with enhanced access to resources, funding, and developmental schemes from the central government. This facilitated the implementation of infrastructure projects, such as [[Lengpui Airport]], educational initiatives, healthcare programs, and poverty alleviation measures aimed at fostering socio-economic growth and improving the quality of life for its citizens.

==Geography==

It is situated on a ridge 1,132&nbsp;metres (3715&nbsp;ft) above sea level, with the [[Tlawng]] river [[valley]] to its west and the [[Tuirial]] river valley to its east.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aizawl - the State Capital: Mizoram |url=https://mizoram.nic.in/more/aizawl.htm |access-date=2023-11-06 |website=mizoram.nic.in}}</ref>
