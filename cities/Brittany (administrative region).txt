'''Brittany''' ({{langx|fr|Bretagne}} {{IPA|fr|bʁətaɲ||fr-Bretagne.ogg}}; {{langx|br|Breizh}} {{IPA|br|brɛjs|}}; [[Gallo language|Gallo]]: ''Bertaèyn'' {{IPA|fr-gallo|bəʁtaɛɲ|}}) is the westernmost [[regions of France|region]] of [[Metropolitan France]]. It covers about four fifths of the territory of the historic province of [[Brittany]]. It is one of two [[Regions of France|regions in Metropolitan France]] that do not contain any landlocked [[Departments in France|departments]], the other being [[Corsica]].

Brittany is a peninsular region bordered by the [[English Channel]] to the north and the [[Bay of Biscay]] to the south, and its neighbouring regions are [[Normandy (administrative region)|Normandy]] to the northeast and [[Pays de la Loire]] to the southeast. "[[Bro Gozh ma Zadoù]]" is the anthem of Brittany. It is sung to the same tune as that of the national anthem of [[Wales]], "{{lang|cy|[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]|italic=no}}", and has similar words. As a region of France, Brittany has a [[Regional Council of Brittany|Regional Council]], which was most recently elected in [[2021 French regional elections|2021]].
The capital of the administrative region is [[Rennes]], although [[Nantes]] is considered the capital of historic Brittany and is located in [[Loire-Atlantique]].

== Territory ==
[[File:LeDiben Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Le Diben harbour – [[Plougasnou]]]]
The region of Brittany was created in 1941 from four of the five [[departments of France|departments]] constituting the territory of [[Brittany (historical province)|traditional Brittany]]. The other is [[Loire-Atlantique]], which is included in the region of [[Pays de la Loire]], whose capital, [[Nantes]], was a historical capital of the [[Duchy of Brittany]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The capital of the administrative region is [[Rennes]], although [[Nantes]] is considered the capital of historic Brittany and is located in [[Loire-Atlantique]]. The [[reunification of Brittany]] is supported by a majority of Loire-Atlantique and is considered a prerequisite to further autonomy of Brittany as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web |title=La moitié des habitants de la Bretagne à 5 favorables à un rattachement de la Loire-Atlantique |url=https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https://www.letelegramme.fr/static/ftp/dossier/data/bretagne_sondage/sondage.html#federation=archive.wikiwix.com&tab=url |access-date=18 October 2023 |website=archive.wikiwix.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=9 April 2022 |title=Brittany lays claim to autonomy, in Corsica's footsteps |language=en |work=Le Monde.fr |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2022/04/09/brittany-lays-claim-to-autonomy-in-corsica-s-footsteps_5980128_7.html |access-date=18 October 2023}}</ref>

Part of the reason Brittany was split between two present-day regions was to avoid the rivalry between Rennes and Nantes. Although Nantes was the principal capital of the Duchy of Brittany until the sixteenth century, Rennes had been the seat of the Duchy's supreme court of justice between 1560 and 1789. Rennes had also been the administrative capital of the [[Intendant]] of Brittany between 1689 and 1789, and Intendances were the most important administrative units of the [[kingdom of France]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As for the provincial States of Brittany, a legislative body which had originally met every two years in a different city of Brittany, that had met in Rennes only between 1728 and 1789, although not in the years 1730, 1758, and 1760. Despite that, the ''[[Chambre des comptes]]'' had remained in Nantes until 1789. However, from 1381 until the end of the fifteenth century [[Vannes]] (''Gwened'' in Breton) had served as the administrative capital of the Duchy, remaining the seat of its ''Chambre des comptes'' until the 1490s, and also the seat of its ''Parlement'' until 1553 and then again between 1675 and 1689.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Although there were previous plans to create regions out of the departments, like the Clémentel plan (1919) or the Vichy regionalisation programme (1941), these plans had no effect or else were abolished in 1945. The current [[Regions of France|French regions]] date from 1956 and were created by gathering departments together.<ref>Michèle Cointet, op. cit., pp. 183–216 (p. 216 pour la citation)</ref> In Brittany, this led to the creation of the new region of Brittany, which included only four out of the five historical Breton departments. The term ''région'' was officially created by the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982), which also gave regions their legal status. The first direct elections for regional representatives took place on 16 March 1986.<ref>Jean-Marie Miossec (2009), ''Géohistoire de la régionalisation en France,'' Paris: Presses universitaires de France {{ISBN|978-2-13-056665-6}}.</ref>

{{main|History of Brittany}}
Brittany, located in the west-north-west corner of France, is one of the historic provinces of France. The most Atlantic of France's regions, Brittany is noted for its Celtic heritage, which sets it apart from the rest of France. It enjoys a mild climate somewhat warmer though not necessarily drier than the climate of the Cornish peninsula in south-west Britain.

The name "Brittany" derives from the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]], an [[Insular Celtic]] (Brythonic) people who inhabited most of [[Great Britain]] during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Sub-Roman Britain|Sub-Roman]] periods. During the [[migration period]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] the Britons were displaced from most of what is now England by the [[Anglo-Saxon occupation of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasions]], leading many to settle in western [[Armorica]], present-day Brittany. As a result the modern [[Bretons]] have strong historical, cultural and linguistic ties with those areas of Great Britain which remained Brythonic into the modern era: [[Wales]] and [[Cornwall]].

Initially divided into several small [[petty kingdom]]s, Brittany as a united political entity emerged in the 9th century as the [[Kingdom of Brittany]]. In the early 10th century the kingdom was devastated by [[Viking Brittany|Norse raids and occupation]] and from the mid-10th century became a [[vassal state]] of [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] as the [[Duchy of Brittany]]. The level of control exerted by the French kings varied over time; at various points Brittany was either subject to, aligned with or heavily influenced by the [[Kingdom of England|English Kings]]; at others it was ''de facto'' independent.

Following the Breton defeat at the hands of the French army in 1488, the duchy was forced into a [[dynastic union]] with the French crown in 1491; in 1547 it was [[Union of Brittany and France|formally incorporated]] as a [[Provinces of France|province of France]].

Following the [[French Revolution]] the French provinces were dissolved and replaced with [[Departments of France|department]]s; what had been Brittany became the Côtes-du-Nord (22) (renamed Côtes-d'Armor in 1990) in the north, Finistère (29) in the far west, Morbihan (56) in the south, Ille et Vilaine (35) in the east and Loire-Inférieure (44) (renamed Loire-Atlantique in 1957) in the southeast.

When the modern regions were established, Loire-Inférieure (44), which includes the historic capital Nantes, became part of [[Pays de la Loire]], while the other four departments became part of the Brittany region. The capital city of the modern Brittany region is Rennes, located in the central eastern part of the region; most of the major lines of communication between Brittany and Paris pass through Rennes, which is a large industrial and university city. Other important cities in the region are [[Brest, France|Brest]], one of the two most important French naval ports, [[Saint-Malo]], an imposing walled city on the north coast, and [[Vannes]], the capital of the [[Morbihan]], with an attractive old town centre. [[Quimper]], the capital of the [[Finistère]], and [[Saint-Brieuc]], the capital of the [[Côtes-d'Armor]], are less important.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Lorient]], in the Morbihan, was once a major shipping port trading with – as its name suggests – the Orient; but its shipping and shipbuilding industries have largely declined, and like other ports on the south coast of Brittany, is better known today for its yachting and yacht-building industry. It is also the venue for Brittany's annual [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient|Interceltiques music and culture festival]].

Despite its limited size, Brittany is quite a diverse region; the north and west coasts, open to the force of the North Atlantic, are rugged and rocky, with sandy coves and beaches. The south coast, facing onto the Bay of Biscay, is flatter, much milder, and has a number of large sandy beaches. There are also many inlets on the south coast, such as La Trinité sur Mer, which in the past have been ports and commercial harbours, but today are more popular with yachtsmen and a dwindling fishing industry.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The sea here is warmer in summer. The backbone of Brittany is a granite ridge stretching from east to west, peaking in the Monts d'Arrée. But most of inland Brittany is farming country, a region known for its milk and butter and its early crops.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

As a holiday region, it is Brittany's coasts that attract the greatest number of visitors; the inland regions have attracted many second-home owners from other parts of France, and from Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}
In cultural terms, Brittany has its own language and Celtic cultural tradition that set it apart from the rest of France. The [[Breton language]], though not much used in everyday life, and not understood by most of the modern population, has made a comeback in recent years, and is taught in many schools. Celtic traditions are reflected in Breton folk music, its Celtic festivals, and its prehistoric monuments.

The name of Brittany derives from [[Celtic Britons|settlers]] from [[Great Britain]], who fled the island in the wake of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] invasions of England between the fifth and seventh centuries. Unlike the rest of France and Brittany, [[Lower Brittany]] (roughly, west of a boundary from [[Saint-Brieuc|Saint Brieuc]] to [[Vannes]]) has maintained a distinctly [[Celtic language]], [[Breton language|Breton]], which is related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. It was the dominant language in Lower, or western, Brittany until the mid-20th century. It has been granted [[regional language]] status and revival efforts are underway.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} In [[Upper Brittany|Upper, or eastern, Brittany]], the traditional language is [[Gallo language|Gallo]], an [[Oïl language]], which has also received regional recognition and is in the process of being revived.

[[File:Logo in breton language used by Regional Council of Brittany and its administrative territory.png|thumb|Breton is used on Regional Council of Brittany logo]]The French administration now allows for some Breton or Gallo to be used by the region and its communes, in road signs and names of towns and cities, alongside the official [[French language]] version. The two regional languages are also taught in some schools, and many folklore associations and clubs are trying to revive them.

Brittany has historically been a stronghold of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its rates of [[church attendance]] have tended to be considerably higher than the national average. However, in recent years the influence of the church has declined.

The Region of Brittany is administered by the [[Regional Council of Brittany]].

The region was a traditionally conservative and [[Christian democratic]] region, with the notable exception of the department of [[Côtes-d'Armor]], a longtime stronghold of the political left. However, the whole of Brittany has recently been moving towards the left, in 2004 electing [[Jean-Yves Le Drian]] as its first [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] regional president, and in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]] voting for Socialist [[Ségolène Royal]]. The centrist candidate [[François Bayrou]] also polled relatively highly in the region and [[Fougères]] elected a [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]] deputy to the National Assembly (he has since joined the pro-[[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] [[New Centre]]). The [[French Communist Party]]'s support is largely concentrated in the south-west of the [[Côtes-d'Armor]] and north-west of [[Morbihan]]. The [[The Greens (France)|Greens]] and other environmentalist parties have traditionally been strong in the region, especially in urban areas such as [[Rennes]] or [[Arrondissement of Quimper|Quimper]]. The region was one of the few which voted "Yes" to the European constitution in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|2005 referendum]], and Brittany continues, along with [[Alsace]], to be a strongly pro-European region.

The Socialist Party controls three [[Departmental councils (France)|departmental councils]] ([[Ille-et-Vilaine]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]], and [[Finistère]]), while the centrist [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]] controls that of [[Morbihan]], in a coalition with the right.

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 99.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.2% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,700 euros or 89% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 100% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018 |website=Eurostat |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417095003/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>

There are several [[:Category:Airports in Brittany|airports in Brittany]] ([[Rennes–Saint-Jacques Airport|Rennes]], [[Brest Bretagne Airport|Brest]], [[Lorient South Brittany Airport|Lorient]]...) serving destinations in [[Europe]]. [[TGV]] train services link the region with cities such as [[Paris]] in 1h27m due to the [[LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire]], [[Lyon]], [[Lille]] and the largest French cities. [[TER Bretagne]] is the regional rail network serving Brittany in order to link the cities of Brittany to each other. [[OUIBUS]] coach services link the region with the largest cities in [[France]] at low cost. In addition there is [[Brittany Ferries]] that take passengers, vehicles and freight to the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]] and [[Condor Ferries]] to the [[Channel Islands]].
