The current form of the metropolis emerged as an offshoot of the [[Walled town of Riyadh|eponymous walled town]] following the dismantling of [[Riyadh city fortifications|its defensive fortifications]] in the 1950s, after which the city underwent several phases of expansion and urbanization.

It is the [[List of Arabian cities by population|largest city]] on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and is situated in the center of the [[An Nafud|an-Nafud]] desert, on the eastern part of the [[Najd]] [[plateau]].

The first mention of the city by the name ''Riyadh'' was in 1590, by an Arab chronicler.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}} In 1745, [[Dahham ibn Dawwas]], who was from the neighboring [[Manfuha]], seized control of [[Walled town of Riyadh|the town]]. [[Dahham ibn Dawwas|Dahham]] built a [[Al Hukm Palace|mudbrick palace]] and [[Riyadh city fortifications|a wall]] around the [[Walled town of Riyadh|town]], and the best-known source of the name ''Riyadh'' is from this period, thought to be referring to the earlier oasis towns that predated the [[Riyadh city fortifications|wall]] built by [[Dahham ibn Dawwas|Ibn Dawwas]].{{sfn|Al-Oteibi|1993|p=163}} In 1744, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab|Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab]] formed an alliance with the [[Emir]] of [[Diriyah]], [[Muhammad bin Saud]], and they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state, now known as the ''[[Emirate of Diriyah|First Saudi State]]'', collapsed in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the ''[[Emirate of Nejd|Second Saudi State]]'' in the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However, his reign over the [[Walled town of Riyadh|city]] was disrupted by a joint [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman–]][[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Rashidi]] alliance. Finally, in the early 20th century, '[[Ibn Saud|Abdulaziz ibn Saud]], known in the west simply as Ibn Saud, retrieved his ancestral [[Emirate of Nejd|kingdom of Najd]] in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926 with the final [[Saudi conquest of Hejaz]],{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} subsequently naming his kingdom 'Saudi Arabia' in September 1932{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} with Riyadh as the capital.{{sfn|Facey|1992|p=271}} The [[Walled town of Riyadh|town]] was the administrative center of the government until 1938, when Ibn Saud moved to the [[Murabba Palace]]. In the 1950s, the [[Riyadh city fortifications|walls]] were dismantled and Riyadh metropolis outgrew as an offshoot of the [[Walled town of Riyadh|walled town]]. 

Riyadh is the political and administrative center of Saudi Arabia. The [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Consultative Assembly]] (also known as the ''Shura Council''), the [[Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia|Council of Ministers]], the [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] and the [[Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia|Supreme Judicial Council]] are all situated in the city. Alongside these four bodies that form the core of the [[legal system of Saudi Arabia]], the headquarters of other major and minor governmental bodies are also located in Riyadh.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Moon|first=Carol|title=LibGuides: A Guide to Saudi Arabia Politics: 1.Government of Saudi Arabia|url=https://slulibrary.saintleo.edu/c.php?g=368413&p=2487969|access-date=2020-07-25|website=slulibrary.saintleo.edu|language=en}}</ref> The city hosts 114 [[List of diplomatic missions in Saudi Arabia|foreign embassies]], most of which are located in the [[Diplomatic Quarter (Riyadh)|Diplomatic Quarter]] in the western reaches of the city.

Riyadh also holds [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|economic significance]], as it contains the headquarters of many banks and major companies, such as the [[National Commercial Bank (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi National Bank]] (SNB), [[Al-Rajhi Bank]], [[SABIC]], [[Almarai]], [[Saudi Telecom Company|STC]], and [[Samba (bank)|Samba Financial Group]]. [[Highway 65 (Saudi Arabia)|Highway 65]], known locally as the King Fahd Road, runs through some of these important centers in the city, including the [[King Abdullah Financial District]], one of the world's largest financial districts, the [[Al Faisaliyah Center|Faisaliyah Center]] and the [[Kingdom Centre|Kingdom Center]]. Riyadh is one of the world's fastest-growing cities in population and is home to many [[expatriate]]s. 

The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, which are overseen by the [[Riyadh Municipality|Municipality of Riyadh]] headed by the mayor; and the [[Royal Commission for Riyadh]], which is chaired by the Governor of the Province, [[Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud (born 1945)|Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud]].

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Early history===
During the [[Jahiliyya|Pre-Islamic era]], the city at the site of modern Riyadh was called [[Hajr]] ({{langx|ar|حجر}}), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of [[Banu Hanifa]].{{sfn|Sonbol|2012|p=99}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=al-hakawati - Riyadh |url=http://al-hakawati.net/en_civilizations/CivilizationDetails/17147/Riyadh |access-date=2023-04-16 |website=al-hakawati.net}}</ref> [[Hajr]] served as the capital of the province of [[Al-Yamamah]], whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern [[Arabia]] during the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the [[Abbasid Empire]] in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the [[Ukhaydhirites]], who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby [[Al-Kharj]]. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as "the main city of [[Al-Yamamah]], and its name is [[Hajr]]". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to the [[Bani Hanifa]], and reports that he continued on with their leader to [[Mecca]] to perform the [[Hajj]].

Later on, [[Hajr]] broke up into several separate settlements and estates. The most notable of these were [[Migrin]] (or Muqrin) and [[Mikal, Riyadh|Mi'kal]], though the name ''[[Hajr]]'' continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to the area by the name ''Riyadh'' comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring [[Manfuha]], took control of Riyadh.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}} Ibn Dawwas built a [[Riyadh city wall|single wall]] to encircle the various oasis towns in the area, making them effectively a [[walled town of Riyadh|single fortress city]]. The name "Riyadh", meaning "gardens" refers to these earlier oasis towns.{{sfn|Al-Oteibi|1993|p=163}}

===Economy===
The capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, was initially known for its availability of water and fertile land which made it ideal for farming dates and other crops.  Wheat was also widely grown until the crops were infested with insects and mites. After Riyadh was  designated as the capital in the  mid-1900s,  Riyadh became  a manufacturing hub. Almost one-third of Saudi Arabia’s factories are located in Riyadh, producing a range of products including machinery, equipment, metallurgical goods, chemicals, construction materials, food, textiles, furniture, and numerous publications.<ref>{{cite web |last1=U4SSC |title=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia factsheet|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/ssc/united/Documents/U4SSC%20Publications/Factsheets/Factsheet_Riyadh_Saudi-Arabia.pdf}}</ref>

===First Saudi State===
[[File:1922 map Riyadh by Philby.png|thumb|1922 map of the [[walled town of Riyadh]]]]
In 1750, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] formed an alliance with [[Muhammad ibn Saud]], the ruler of the nearby town of [[Diriyah]]. Ibn Saud then set out to conquer the surrounding region with the goal of bringing it under the rule of a single Islamic state. Ibn Dawwas of Riyadh led the most determined resistance, allied with forces from [[al-Kharj|Al Kharj]], [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al Ahsa]], and the [[Banu Yam]] clan of [[Najran]]. However, Ibn Dawwas fled and Riyadh capitulated to the Saudis in 1774, ending long years of wars, and leading to the declaration of the [[First Saudi State]], with Diriyah as its capital.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}}

The First Saudi State was destroyed by forces sent by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], acting on behalf of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Ottoman forces razed the Saudi capital Diriyah in 1818.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}} They had maintained a garrison at [[Najd]]. This marked the decline of the House of Saud for a short time.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}} [[Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad]] became the first Amir of the [[Second Saudi State]]; the cousin of Saud bin Saud, he ruled for 19 years till 1834, leading to the consolidation of the area though they were notionally under the control of Muhammad Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}} In 1823, Turki ibn Abdallah chose Riyadh as the new capital.<ref name=Report>{{cite book|title=The Report: Saudi Arabia 2008|year = 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMPjxHzG1xQC&pg=PA208|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=978-1-902339-00-9|page=208}}</ref> Following the assassination of Turki in 1834, his eldest son Faisal killed the assassin, took control of the capital, and refused to be controlled by the [[Viceroy of Egypt]]. Najd was then invaded, and Faisal was taken captive and held in [[Cairo]]. However, as [[Egypt]] became independent of the Ottoman Empire, Faisal escaped after five years of incarceration, returned to Najd, and resumed his reign, ruling until 1865 and consolidating the reign of the House of Saud.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}}

Following the death of Faisal, there was rivalry among his sons which situation was exploited by [[Rashidi dynasty|Muhammad bin Rashid]] who took most of Najd, signed a treaty with the Ottomans, and also captured [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Hasa]] in 1871. In 1889, [[Abdul Rahman bin Faisal]], the third son of Faisal again regained control over Najd and ruled till 1891, whereafter the control was regained by Muhammad bin Raschid.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}}

Internecine struggles between Turki's grandsons led to the fall of the Second Saudi State in 1891 at the hand of the rival [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]] clan, which ruled from the northern city of [[Ha'il]]. The [[al-Masmak]] fort dates from that period.<ref name=Report/>

Abdul Rahman bin Faisal al-Saud had sought refuge among a tribal community on the outskirts of Najd and then went to [[Kuwait]] with his family and stayed in exile. However, his son [[Ibn Saud|Abdul Aziz]] retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926, and further expanded his kingdom to cover "most of the Arabian Peninsula."{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} He named his kingdom as [[Saudi Arabia]] in September 1932{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} with Riyadh as the capital.{{sfn|Facey|1992|p=271}} King Abdul Aziz died in 1953 and his son Saud took control as per the established succession rule of father to son from the time Muhammad bin Saud had established the Saud rule in 1744. However, this established line of succession was broken when King Saud was succeeded by his brother King Faisal in 1964. In 1975, Faisal was succeeded by his brother King Khalid. In 1982, King Fahd took the reins from his brother. This new line of succession is among the sons of King Abdul Aziz who has 35 sons; this large family of Ibn Saud hold all key positions in the large kingdom.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}}

===Modern history===
[[File:Workers breaking old city walls of Riyadh.jpg|thumb|The demolition of the [[Riyadh city wall|city walls]] in 1950 was a prelude to the expansion and modernization of the city.]]
From the 1940s, Riyadh mushroomed from a relatively narrow, spatially isolated town into a spacious metropolis.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=124}} When [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] came to power, he made it his objective to modernize Riyadh, and began developing Annasriyyah, the royal residential district, in 1950.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=124}} Following the example of American cities, new settlements and entire neighborhoods were created on [[grid plan]]s, and connected by high-capacity main roads to the inner areas. The grid pattern in the city was introduced in 1953.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=124}} The population growth of the town from 1974 to 1992 averaged 8.2 percent per year.

On 16 November 1983, [[King Khalid International Airport]] was officially opened by [[King Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], in memory to the late [[King Khalid of Saudi Arabia|King Khalid]]. It remains the biggest airport in the world at nearly 300 sq miles to date.

[[Al-Qaeda]] under [[Osama bin Laden]] launched [[Riyadh compound bombings|coordinated attacks]] on compounds in Riyadh on 12 May 2003, resulting in the deaths of 39 people. The bombings were considered to be a terrorism campaign against Western influence in Saudi Arabia.

In 2010, the first Saudi capital [[Diriyah]], on the northwestern outskirts of Riyadh was inscribed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

The mayor is Prince Faisal bin Abdulaziz al-Muqrin. Al-Muqrin was appointed in 2019 by royal decree <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1590146/saudi-arabia |title=Prince Faisal bin Abdulaziz appointed as Riyadh mayor by royal decree |website=Arab News | date=27 November 2019}}</ref> and succeeds Tariq bin Abdul Aziz Al-Faris. Riyadh is now the administrative and to a great extent the commercial hub of the Kingdom. According to the Saudi Real Estate Companion, most large companies in the country established either sole headquarters or a large office in the city.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Saudi-Real-Estate-Companion-Essential-ebook/dp/B01DTNO0SC|title=Saudi Real Estate Companion: Essential Real Estate Skills for the Saudi Arabian Market|last1=Mueller|first1=H. E.|last2=Williams|first2=A. D.|date=4 April 2016|publisher=Booktango|language=en}}</ref> For this reason, there has been significant growth in high-rise developments in all areas of the city. Most notable among these is [[King Abdullah Financial District]] which is fast becoming the key business hub in the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-43069-interserve-mena-chief-hopeful-of-saudi-fms-growth/|title=Interserve MENA chief hopeful of Saudi FM's growth {{!}} ConstructionWeekOnline.com|last=Bhatia|first=Neha|newspaper=Construction Week Online|date=15 February 2017 |access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> Riyadh also has the largest all-female university in the world, the [[Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=David|title=Saudi Arabia opens world's largest women's university|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=220949|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=13 March 2011 |access-date=17 January 2012}}</ref>

According to the [[Global Financial Centres Index]], Riyadh ranked at 77 in 2016–2017. Though the rank moved up to 69 in 2018, diversification in the economy of the capital is required in order to avoid what the [[World Bank]] called a "looming poverty crisis" brought on by lingering low oil prices and rich state benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/21/saudi-arabia-is-backsliding-in-effort-to-build-global-financial-center.html|title=Saudi Arabia is stumbling in its efforts to build a global financial center|date=21 August 2018|publisher=CNBC|access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref>

=== Urban development History ===

==== Up to 1930s: ====
Historical Riyadh was enclosed by walls. At its center was a town square and a market ([[souq]]), surrounded by residential quarters of mosques and adobe homes, each with an interior courtyard. Outside its walls were orchards of [[Date palm|date trees]], hence the name ‘Riyadh’ or ‘gardens’. During the 1930s, there was an initial outward expansion because new administrative buildings were needed for the country and because the population was growing. According to Dr. Saleh Al Hathloul, former deputy minister of town planning, this era coincided with the period of sedentarization as nomads settled in and around towns and cities such as Riyadh. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Al-Hathloul |first=Saleh |last2=Edadan |first2=Narayanan |date=1993-01-01 |title=Evolution of settlement pattern in Saudi Arabia: A historical analysis |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019739759390027A |journal=Habitat International |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=31–46 |doi=10.1016/0197-3975(93)90027-A |issn=0197-3975}}</ref>

==== 1940s - 1950s: ====
When commercial oil production began, there was a rapid rise in the rate of urbanization and the city transitioned from traditional to newer houses and buildings. This included the railway station and the (now-defunct) [[King Salman Air Base|first airport]] of Riyadh. Government departments were relocated from [[Jeddah]] to Riyadh and new ministry buildings were built. To accommodate the government employees who had moved in from Jeddah, the government developed the Malaz housing block. This block’s layout was influenced by the layouts of [[Dammam]] and [[Khobar]], which in turn were influenced by the Aramco-built [[Dhahran]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Almogren |first=Faisal |date=2023 |title=City-Building Practices in Riyadh, A Case of Master Planning from the Gulf |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0348823m |journal=UC Berkeley Electronic Theses and Dissertations}}</ref> Malaz, with its street grid and detached house type, was instrumental in shaping the master plans for Riyadh that followed, as per Dr. Saleh Al Hathloul.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alhathloul |first=Saleh |title=The evolution of urban and regional planning in saudi arabia |url=https://www.academia.edu/88462888/The_evolution_of_urban_and_regional_planning_in_saudi_arabia |journal=The evolution of urban and regional planning in saudi arabia}}</ref> 

==== 1960s - 1970s: ====
The Department of Municipal Affairs (later [[Ministry of Municipalities and Housing]]) selected Doxiadis Associates (DA) in 1968 to prepare a masterplan for Riyadh. After preliminary studies, they submitted a plan that was approved in 1972. They proposed that Riyadh will expand in the north-south axis along a commercial spine with and most importantly, that it will be divided into neighborhoods of 2 x 2 km blocks, thus solidifying the grid pattern to be the defining feature of Riyadh’s layout. It also maintains the style of housing that was prominent in Malaz, detached houses with setbacks, designed in what Dr. Saleh Al Hathloul identifies as an ‘international Mediterranean’ style i.e. crimson colors.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Riyadh Architecture in One Hundred Years |url=https://www.csbe.org/riyadh-architecture-in-one-hundred-years-1 |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=Center for the Study of the Built Environment |language=en-US}}</ref> However, DA’s shortcomings lay in their inability to accurately predict the extent of Riyadh’s future growth. 

At the start of the 70s, Riyadh did not go much beyond what is today the Khurais road. But nearing the 80s, Riyadh’s expansion had already reached the Northern Ring Road in the north and had made considerable progress in the eastern part of the city. 

In 1974, the government founded the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh (later [[Royal Commission for Riyadh City]]) which was headed by the then governor of [[Riyadh Province]], [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman Bin Abdulaziz]], who oversaw Riyadh’s development.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-12-21 |title=How King Salman built a capital for the 21st century |url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1212686 |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=Arab News |language=en}}</ref> With the economic growth and national development plans of the 70s, the national infrastructure consisting of electricity grids, telecommunications networks, water pipelines, and highways was laid down that made further urban growth possible. The old and new industrial cities of Riyadh were both founded in this period. 

==== 1980s - 1990s: ====
The city grew at a much faster rate than Doxiadis Associates had projected and very soon, their plan became obsolete. DA predicted that Riyadh’s urban area would be 304 km<sup>2</sup> in 30 years when it reached 400 km<sup>2</sup> just four years after the plan was authorized. <ref name=":0" /> Therefore, SCET International was assigned to revise and update the original plan to reflect the drastic growth and offer adaptive measures, which were approved in 1982. While keeping the 2km x 2km block, they expanded it in all directions unlike DA’s linear expansion. They also added the radial ring roads and altered the DA conception of how commercial and other zones should be distributed.

It was in the 80s and 90s that most of the buildings that defined Riyadh’s urban identity were constructed. Built in styles contemporary of that time, marble with a hint of desert beige, these included the [[King Khalid International Airport]], [[King Fahd Stadium]], Television tower, [[King Saud University]] new campus, the King Faisal Foundation, the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MOMRA, and [[Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University|Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud university]]. And the historical district was rebuilt with the National Museum, [[Qasr Al Hukm District|Qasr AlHukm district]], and the [[Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque|Imam Turki bin Abdullah mosque]].<ref name=":1" />  Numerous health facilities were founded as well. Other developments in this period included the opening of the first shopping centers and supermarkets. 

Approaching the 2000s, Riyadh had expanded well beyond the Northern Ring Road in the north and had reached the Second Ring Road in the east. 

==== 2000s - 2010s: ====
The MEDSTAR (metropolitan development strategy for Arriyadh) was the strategy that directed urban development in this era. Since the SCET plan also turned out to underestimate the rate of growth, a continuous approach instead of a one-off plan was adopted. The MEDSTAR was not a long term plan but an ongoing strategy on managing urban growth and economic development in the city. It was initiated after comprehensive studies by the Arriyadh Development Authority (the high commission’s research wing) on demographics, land use, transportation, security, environment, and traffic safety. In 2007, MEDSTAR won second place in the international award for liveable communities. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Livcom Awards : 2007 Results |url=https://livcomawards.com/previous-winners/2007-results.htm |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=livcomawards.com}}</ref> One of the MEDSTAR strategies was balanced development by turning Riyadh into a polycentric city rather than having one single downtown. [Riyadh: The Metamorphosis of a City From Centerless to Polycentric Fernando Perez,] This has resulted in there being multiple hubs scattered around the city such as Olaya, [[King Abdullah Financial District|KAFD]], Sahafa, Granada, Business Gate, Digital City, and Hittin. 

Riyadh’s skyline arose along the King Fahd Road starting in the 2000s. Significant construction projects like the Riyadh metro and the [[Princess Nourah Bint Abdul Rahman University|Princess Noura University]], the world’s largest women’s university, were undertaken. Most malls and hypermarkets opened in this era and became a feature of city life. The municipality added wide sidewalks to a number of streets which became popular spots for walking, and parks were built in many neighborhoods. Major roads were redesigned, such as the King Fahd road, King Abdullah Road, Abu Bakr Al Siddiq road, and Oruba road, transforming the look of the city. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Abi Bakr Al-Siddiq Road Project. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |url=https://www.idom.com/en/project/road-riyadh-abi-bakr/ |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=IDOM |language=en-US}}</ref> In addition, the Royal Commission rehabilitated the [[Wadi Hanifa]] wetlands. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-10-16 |title=Wadi Hanifah Comprehensive Development Plan {{!}} Landscape Performance Series |url=https://www.landscapeperformance.org/case-study-briefs/wadi-hanifah-comprehensive-development-plan |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=www.landscapeperformance.org |language=en}}</ref> 

At the onset of the 2020s, Riyadh’s expansion had gone further ahead of the King Salman Road in the north and had reached the Janadriyah road in the east.

Many roads and streets, such as the Olaya street and the Imam Saud road, are being refurbished. 

Fewer malls are opening and [[Strip mall|squares]] (or plazas) are taking over in popularity, the most popular having been the Riyadh Boulevard on the Prince Turki Al Awwal Road. A new downtown called ‘New Murabba’ at the intersection of the King Salman and King Khaled roads is planned. 

New fully residential suburbs, unlike regular neighborhoods that have storefront-lined main streets, are under construction in the far north and far east of the city. <ref>{{Cite web |title=التطوير العقاري {{!}} NHC الوطنية للاسكان |url=https://beta.nhc.sa/ar/real-estate-development/ |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=beta.nhc.sa |language=ar}}</ref>


==Geography==

===Climate===

Riyadh has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen Climate Classification]] ''BWh''), with long, extremely hot summers and short, very mild winters. The average high temperature in July is {{convert|43.9|C|F}}. If not for its elevation Riyadh would experience an even hotter climate. The city experiences very little precipitation, especially during the summer, but receives a fair amount of rain in March and April. It is also known to have [[dust storm]]s during which the dust can be so thick that visibility is under {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. On 1 and 2 April 2015, a massive dust storm hit Riyadh, causing the suspension of classes in many schools in the area and the cancellation of hundreds of flights, both domestic and international.

===City districts===
[[File:Riyadh_Skyline.jpg|thumb|Riyadh's skyline in 2018]]
[[File:Dira Square.JPG|thumb|[[Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque]]]]
Riyadh is divided into fourteen branch municipalities,<ref name="a">{{cite web|url=https://www.alriyadh.gov.sa/en/riyadh/riyadhmunic/Pages/home.aspx|title=Interactive Map of Riyadh's branch municipalities|publisher=Riyadh Municipal Government|language=ar}}</ref> in addition to the Diplomatic Quarter. Each branch municipality in turn contains several districts, amounting to over 130 in total, though some districts are divided between more than one branch municipality. The branch municipalities are Al-Shemaysi, [[Irqah]], Al-Ma'athar, Al-Olayya, Al-Aziziyya, Al-Malaz, Al-Selayy, Nemar, Al-Neseem, Al-Shifa, Al-'Urayja, Al-Bat'ha, Al-Ha'ir, Al-Rawdha, and Al-Shimal ("the North"). [[Olaya (Riyadh)|Olaya District]] is the commercial heart of the city,<ref>{{cite book|title=MEED|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-NHAAAAYAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Economic East Economic Digest, Limited|page=4}}</ref> with accommodation, entertainment, dining and shopping options. The [[Kingdom Centre]], [[Al Faisaliyah Center|Al Faisalyah]], and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks. The center of the city, [[Al-Bathaa]] and Al-Deerah, is also its oldest part.

Some of the main districts of Riyadh are:

In 2022, the city had over 7 million people. <ref>{{cite web |last1=USGS |title=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center - Earthshots |url=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center - Earthshots}}</ref> The city had a population of 40,000 inhabitants in 1935 and 83,000 in 1949.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=122}} The city has experienced very high rates of population growth, from 150,000 inhabitants in the 1960s to over seven million, according to the most recent sources. As of 2017, the population of Riyadh is composed of 64.19% Saudis, while non-Saudis account for 35.81% of the population. [[Indians in Saudi Arabia|Indians]] are the largest minority population at 13.7%, followed by [[Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia|Pakistanis]] at 12.4%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Riyadh City |url=http://www.arriyadh.com/ar/AboutArriy/Content/getdocument.aspx?f=/openshare/ar/AboutArriy/Content/riyadhStat_1437.doc_cvt.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170327154442/http://www.arriyadh.com/ar/AboutArriy/Content/getdocument.aspx?f=/openshare/ar/AboutArriy/Content/riyadhStat_1437.doc_cvt.htm |url-status=dead |publisher=Saudi Arabia- Ministry of Interior |archive-date=27 March 2017 |access-date=25 May 2019 }}</ref>
The population is so high due to the doubled birth rates and the high economic growth. There was also an influx of immigrants. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Riyadh |title=Riyadh &#124; Population, Climate, Map, History, & Facts &#124; Britannica }}</ref>

==Landmarks and architecture==

===Vernacular architecture of Old Riyadh===
The old town of Riyadh within the [[Riyadh city wall|city walls]] did not exceed an area of 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and therefore very few significant architectural remnants of the original walled oasis town of Riyadh exist today. The most prominent is the [[Masmak fort]] and some parts of the original wall structure with its gate which have been restored and reconstructed. There are also a number of traditional mud-brick houses within these old limits, but they are for the most part dilapidated.

Expansion outside the [[Riyadh city wall|city walls]] was slow to begin with, although there were some smaller oases and settlements surrounding Riyadh. The first major construction beyond the walls was King Abdulaziz's [[Murabba Palace]]. It was constructed in 1936, completed in 1938, and a household of 800 people moved into it in 1938. The palace is now part of a bigger complex called [[King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre|The King Abdulaziz Historical Centre]].

There are other traditional villages and towns in the area around traditional Riyadh which the [[urban sprawl]] reached and encompasses. These include [[Diriyah]], Manfuha and Wadi Laban. Unlike in the early days of development in Riyadh during which vernacular structures were razed to the ground without consideration, there is a new-found appreciation for traditional architecture. The [[Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage]] is making efforts to revitalize the historic architecture in Riyadh and other parts of the kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scta.gov.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx|title=SCTH - default|work=scta.gov.sa|access-date=16 January 2014|archive-date=27 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227085905/https://www.scta.gov.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

;Ain Heet Cave

[[Ein Heet Cave|Ain Heet cave]] has an underground lake (150 meters deep) situated at the face of Mount Al Jubayl in Wadi As Sulay in a small village called Heet in Riyadh. Between Riyadh and Al Kharj road, it is one of the easily accessible caves in the area of Riyadh.

===Archeological sites===
[[File:Murabba Palace.jpg|left|thumb|267x267px|A courtyard in the Murabba Palace]]
The archeological sites at Riyadh which are of historical importance, in which the Municipality of Riyadh is involved, are the five old gates on the old walls of Riyadh. These are the eastern gate of Thumaira, the northern gate of Al-Suwailen, the southern gate of Dukhna, the western gate of Al-Madhbah, and the south-western gate of Shumaisi. There are also four historic palaces: [[Masmak Castle|Musmak Palace]], [[Murabba Palace]] (palace of King Abdul Aziz), Atiqah Palace (belongs to Prince [[Muhammad bin Abdul-Rahman|Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman]]) and Al Shamsiah Palace (belongs to [[Saud Al Kabeer bin Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Faisal Al Saud|Saud Al Kabeer]]).{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=22}}

====Masmak Fortress====
{{Main|Masmak fort}}
This fortress was built around 1865 under the reign of [[Mohammed ibn Abdullah ibn Rasheed]] (1289-1315 AH), the ruler of [[Ha'il]] to the north, who had wrested control of the city from the rival clan of [[Al Saud]]. In January 1902 [[Ibn Saud]], who was at the time living in exile in [[Kuwait]], succeeded in capturing the Masmak fortress from its Rashid garrison. The event, which restored Saudi control over Riyadh, has acquired an almost mythical status in the history of Saudi Arabia. The story of the event is often retold and has as its central theme the heroism and bravery of King Abdulaziz al-Saud. The Masmak Fortress is now a museum and is in close proximity to the Clock Tower Square, also known to English-speaking residents as [[Chop Chop Square]], referring to the capital punishment that takes place there.

===Contemporary architecture===

====Kingdom Centre====
{{Main|Kingdom Centre}}
Designed by the team of [[Ellerbe Becket]] and [[Omrania and Associates|Omrania]], the tower is built on 94,230&nbsp;square meters of land. The Kingdom Centre is owned by a group of companies including [[Kingdom Holding Company]], headed by [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]], a prince of the Saudi royal family, and is the headquarters of the holding company. The project cost 2&nbsp;billion Saudi Arabian Riyals and the contract was undertaken by El-Seif. The Kingdom Centre is the winner of the 2002 [[Emporis Skyscraper Award]], selected as the "best new skyscraper of the year for design and functionality". A three-level shopping center, which also won a major design award, fills the east wing. The large opening is illuminated at night in continuously changing colors. The shopping center has a separate floor for women only to shop where men are not allowed to enter.

The Kingdom Tower has 99 stories and is the fifth tallest structure in the country, rising to 300 m. A special aspect of the tower is that it is divided into two parts in the last one-third of its height and is linked by a sky-bridge walkway, which provides extensive views of Riyadh.{{sfn|Jordan|2011|p=98}}

====Burj Rafal Hotel Kempinski====
{{Main|Burj Rafal}}

Burj Rafal, located on King Fahd Road, is the tallest skyscraper in Riyadh at 307.9 meters (1,010 feet) tall. The tower was designed and engineered by P & T Group. Construction began in 2010 and was completed in 2014. The project was considered a success, with 70% of the residential units already sold by the time the skyscraper was topped out. The tower contains 474 residential condominium units and a 349-room 5-star Kempinski hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/riyadh/burj-rafal/9554/ |title=Burj Rafal |publisher=The Skyscraper Center |access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>  

====Burj Al Faisaliyah====

{{Main|Al Faisaliyah Center}}
Al Faisaliyah Centre (Arabic: برج الفيصلية) is the first skyscraper constructed in Saudi Arabia and is the third tallest building in Riyadh after the Burj Rafal and the [[Kingdom Centre]]. The golden ball that lies atop the tower is said to be inspired by a ballpoint pen, and contains a restaurant; immediately below this is an outside viewing deck. There is a shopping center with major world brands at ground level. Al Faisaliyah Centre also has a hotel on both sides of the tower while the main building is occupied by office. The Al Faisaliyah Tower has 44 stories.{{sfn|Jordan|2011|p=98}} It was designed by [[Foster and Partners]].

====Riyadh TV Tower====
{{Main|Riyadh TV Tower}}
[[File:Pergamon-Museum - Anthropomorphe Stele 2.jpg|thumb|190px|Anthropomorphic stela from the [[4th millennium BC]] at the [[National Museum of Saudi Arabia]], Riyadh]]
The Riyadh TV Tower is a 170&nbsp;meter high television tower located inside the premises of the Saudi Ministry of Information. It is a vertical cantilever structure which was built between 1978 and 1981. The first movie made in 1983 by the TV tower group and named "1,000 Nights and Night" had Mohammed Abdu and Talal Mmdah as the main characters. At that time, there were no women on TV because of religious restrictions. Three years later, Abdul Khaliq Al-Ghanim produced a TV series called "Tash Ma Tash," which earned a good reaction from audiences in [[Eastern Arabia]]. This series created a media revolution back in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://structurae.net/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000282|title=Riyadh Television Tower|access-date=19 January 2014|publisher=Structurae.net}}</ref>

===Museums and collections===
{{main|Museums in Riyadh}}
In 1999, a new central museum was built in Riyadh, at the eastern side of the [[King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre]]. The [[National Museum of Saudi Arabia]] combined several collections and pieces that had up until then been scattered over several institutions and other places in Riyadh and the Kingdom. For example, the meteorite fragment is known as the "Camel's Hump", recovered in 1966 from the [[Wabar craters|Wabar site]], that was on display at the [[King Saud University]] in Riyadh became the new entry piece of the National Museum of Saudi Arabia.

The [[Royal Saudi Air Force Museum]], or Saqr Al-Jazira, is located on the East Ring Road of Riyadh between exits 10 and 11. It contains a collection of aircraft and aviation-related items used by the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] and [[Saudia]] (Saudi Arabian Airlines).

==Sports==
[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Saudi Arabia. The city hosts four major football clubs, [[Al-Hilal FC|Al-Hilal]] was established in 1957 and has won 19 championships in the [[Saudi Professional League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/saudi-arabia/al-hilal-riyadh/|title=Al Hilal (Riyadh)|publisher=Soccerway.com|access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref> [[Al-Nassr]] club is another team in the top league that has many supporters around the kingdom. It was established in 1955, and has been named champion of the Saudi professional League 9<ref>[[:ar:دوري المحترفين السعودي#Ù.82Ø§Ø¦Ù.85ة Ø§Ù.84Ø£Ø¨Ø·Ø§Ù.84]]</ref> times.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Al-Nassr Football Club|url=https://www.eyeofriyadh.com/directory/details/8352_al-nassr-football-club|access-date=2020-09-15|website=eyeofriyadh.com|language=en-US}}</ref> Another well-known club, [[Al Shabab FC (Riyadh)|Al-Shabab]], was established in 1947 and holds 6 championships. There is also [[Al-Riyadh]] Club, which was established in 1954, as well as many other minor clubs.<ref name="Ri sports">{{cite web|url=http://www.riyadh.com/Page/Sport/33/|title=Sports|publisher=Riyadh.com|access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref>

The city also has several large stadiums such as [[King Fahd International Stadium]] with a seating capacity of 70,000.<ref name="Ri sports"/> The stadium hosted the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] three times, in the years [[1992 King Fahd Cup|1992]], [[1995 King Fahd Cup|1995]] and [[1997 FIFA Confederations Cup|1997]]. It also hosted the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship|1989]],<ref name="Ri sports"/> and [[Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium]] (Al-Malaz Stadium) that is used mostly for [[Football (soccer)|football]] matches. The stadium has a capacity of 22,500 people.

The city's [[GPYW Indoor Stadium]] served as host arena for the [[1997 Asian Basketball Championship]], where [[Saudi Arabia's national basketball team]] reached the ''Final Four''.

On 29 February 2020, the world's richest thoroughbred horse race took place at the [[King Abdulaziz Racetrack]] in Riyadh. The Saudi Cup is a new race for thoroughbreds aged four and up, to be run at weight-for-age terms over 1800m (9f). The prize money is US$20m with a prize of US$10m to the winner and prize money down to tenth place. The Saudi Cup is perfectly positioned between the Pegasus World Cup and the Dubai World Cup to attract the best horses from around the world to compete for horse racing's richest prize. Putting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the international horseracing map, the Saudi Cup will also hold an undercard of international races on both dirt and the new turf course.

On 26 April 2020, Saudi Arabia entered the bidding process for the 2030 Asian Games; their main rival for this event was [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].
