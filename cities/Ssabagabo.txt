It includes the following neighborhoods, among others: [[Mutundwe]], [[Najjanankumbi]], [[Zana, Uganda|Zana]], Bunnamwaya, Seguku, [[Lubowa]], Ndejje-Lubugumu, Busaabala, Masajja, Kaazi, [[Lweeza]], [[Kigo, Uganda|Kigo]], and Kubbiri.<ref name="Data">{{cite web | accessdate=15 March 2016 | date=15 March 2016 | publisher=Lcmt.org (LCMTO) | last= LCMTO |title= Map of Ssabagbo Municipality | url=http://www.lcmt.org/uganda/wakiso/ssabagabomakindye}}</ref> The coordinates of the new town are 0°14'34.0"N, 32°33'36.0"E (Latitude:0.242789; Longitude:32.559987).<ref>{{google maps | title=Location of Ssabagabo Municipality, Wakiso District, Uganda |url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/0%C2%B014'34.0%22N+32%C2%B033'36.0%22E/@0.2427944,32.5578037,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0| accessdate=15 March 2016}}</ref>

==Overview==
Before its current status, the town was a sub-county in Wakiso District.<ref name="Cit">{{cite web | title=Uganda: Ssabagabo Gets Sub-County Status | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1180482/ssabagabo-sub-county-status | accessdate=15 March 2016 | date=24 September 2008 | first=Samuel | last=Balagadde | newspaper=[[New Vision]] | location=Kampala}}</ref> Generally, the town is already built-up and consists of mainly middle and upper-class neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=15 June 2016|

The old [[Kampala–Entebbe Road]] passes through the eastern portion of the town in a general north-to-south direction. The Munyonyo spur of the new [[Entebbe–Kampala Expressway]] passes through the southern portion of the new town in a general west-to-east direction.<ref name="Data"/>

During the 2016/2017 financial year, which began on 1 July 2016 and ended on 30 June 2017, the municipality budgeted to spend more than USh10 billion. Of that, UShs4.8 billion was expected to come from local taxes while the [[government of Uganda]] was expected to contribute USh5.9 billion.<ref name="New">{{cite web|title=Uganda: Staff Shortage Cripples Work in Wakiso Divisions | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201610270095.html|accessdate=31 July 2017 |date=27 October 2016 |first=and James Kabengwa |location=Kampala | last=Joseph Kiggundu | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] via [[AllAfrica.com]]}}</ref> However the work in the district was hampered by a slow recruitment process, with only 15 out of the required 90 positions filled as of October 2016.<ref name="New"/>
