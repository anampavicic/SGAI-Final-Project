With its recognition as an industrial town as early as the 1911 census, Jamshedpur was set on the road of steady population growth, as large number of emigrants flocked in for work opportunities. While in the earlier decades the central nucleus grew, in the later decades towns around Jamshedpur grew rapidly. In 2011, Jamshedpur Urban Agglomeration included 13 urban centres, with a total population of 1.3 million people. However, in more recent years, Jamshedpur metropolitan area has lacked the growth and development observed around other similar industrial cities in western and southern India.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ahgis/files/3m/5-3.pdf |title = Growth of Industrial Cities in India: A Case Study of Jamshedpur | work= Amaresh Dubey|publisher= The Third Conference: GIS-based Global History from Asian Perspectives, 5 June 2015 | access-date = 25 December 2021}}</ref>
