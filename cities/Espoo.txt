==History==
=== Etymology ===
Before the time of the [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|Swedish colonisation]], Espoo was inhabited by [[Tavastians]], a [[Finnish tribes|Finnish tribe]], and the area in which the city lies on did most likely have a different name. The name of Espoo is believed to have derived from the Medieval Swedish village of ''Espaby'' (or ''Espoby''), which was located in the western part of the present-day city. It may refer to [[Populus tremula|aspen]]s that grew on a nearby riverbank, as the archaic Swedish word for the tree is "äspe", and the word for a river is "å", with the suffix "-by" meaning village.<ref name="History"/><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Asuminen_ja_ymparisto/Kaavoitus/Nimisto/Nakokulmia_nimistoon/Espoon_keskus__Esbo_centrum(97656) |title= Espoon keskus – Esbo centrum |last=  |first=  |date=  |website=  |publisher= City of Espoo |access-date= 5 March 2021 |quote=  |archive-date= 13 April 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210413133158/https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Asuminen_ja_ymparisto/Kaavoitus/Nimisto/Nakokulmia_nimistoon/Espoon_keskus__Esbo_centrum(97656) |url-status= dead }}</ref>

The [[coat of arms]] of Espoo features a gold horseshoe topped by a gold crown on a blue shield. The crown refers to the old ''[[kongsgård|kungsgård]]'' of Espoo and the horseshoe refers to the obligation to transport officials, military or prisoners that parishes along the [[King's Road (Finland)|King's Road]] fell under. Many roads in Espoo still follow the old [[Middle Ages|medieval]] King's Road. The King's Road in Finland, stretching from [[Turku]] in the west to [[Vyborg]] in the east, was formed in the 1340s or 1350s and was the most important road in Finland at the time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160209164224/http://alk.tiehallinto.fi/tiehist/rantatie.htm Suuri Rantatie – Kuninkaantie] 1999.

=== Prehistory ===
Present-day Espoo was first settled by [[hunter-gatherer]]s around 8,000 years ago, a few thousand years after the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|Last Glacial Period]]. [[Stone Age]] settlements have been found from Nuuksio and Perinki.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/> Settlements from the Early Metal Age have been found from Mikkelä<ref>[http://kulttuuriymparisto.nba.fi/netsovellus/rekisteriportaali/portti/default.aspx?sovellus=mjreki&taulu=T_KOHDE&tunnus=49010056 Museovirasto – Rekisteriportaali] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013233332/http://kulttuuriymparisto.nba.fi/netsovellus/rekisteriportaali/portti/default.aspx?sovellus=mjreki&taulu=T_KOHDE&tunnus=49010056 |date=13 October 2016 }}. Accessed on 13 October 2016.</ref> and from Morby dating from the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age (Northern Europe)|Pre-Roman Iron Age]], of which the latter is an important subject relating to research of cattle husbandry.<ref name="haggrén">{{Cite book|last=Georg Haggrén, Petri Halinen, Mika Lavento, Sami Raninen ja Anna Wessman|title=Muinaisuutemme jäljet|publisher=Gaudeamus|year=2015|isbn=9789524953634}}</ref>{{rp|133}} Traces of early settlement in the area remain in the place names. For example, the original name for [[Soukka]] was ''Soukko''.<ref>Ainiala, Terhi; Saarelma, Minna; Sjöblom, Paula: ''Nimistöntutkimuksen perusteet'', p. 127. [[Finnish Literature Society]] 2008.</ref>

The first settlers lived in the northern parts of the current city, around the lakes Pitkäjärvi, Bodomjärvi, and Loojärvi, as the southern parts were still largely covered by the sea. In the Stone Age, people in Espoo lived on south-facing shores and slopes, as they provided shelter from cold continental winds. Living close to water bodies also made hunting and fishing easier. The way of life was dictated by seasonal changes, and people rarely stayed in one place throughout the year.<ref name="History"/>

During the [[Bronze Age]] (c. 1500–500 BCE), human settlement shifted southward. Known settlements from the era are few, but more than 70 [[cairn]]-like burial sites from the period have been discovered, mostly from southern Espoo, which formed an [[archipelago]] at the time. When ironwork was introduced to [[Finland]] around 500 BCE, it gave people access to materials that were far more versatile than materials used before. However, the climate grew colder at the beginning of the [[Iron Age]],<ref name="History"/> and it seems that human settlement in Espoo disappeared during the era.<ref name="Kyppi s. 6"/> Only two discoveries from the time have been made in Espoo.<ref name="History"/>

==== Medieval Espoo ====
[[File:Espoon tuomiokirkko.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran]] [[Espoo Cathedral|Cathedral]] in Espoo, originally built as a [[Catholic]] parish church in the 1480s<ref name="Cathedral History"/>]]
Most of the original villages of present-day Espoo were founded by [[Tavastians|Tavastian Finns]] according to place names. By the 12th century, there were Tavastian houses on the shore of Kaukjärvi (now known as Pitkäjärvi), in [[Kauklahti]], [[Karvasmäki]], Bemböle, Haapalahti and Finnevik.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Kepsu|first=Saulo|title=Uuteen maahan – Helsingin ja Vantaan vanha asutus ja nimistö|publisher=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura|year=2005|isbn=9789517467230|pages=40–42}}</ref>

The first [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|Swedish settlements]] in Uusimaa were established during the 12th or 13th century.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/> Swedish settlers moved to the area through the current site of [[Kirkkonummi]], and then to the Esboby area. From there, they continued northeast to Kauklahti, [[Bemböle]] and [[Vanhakartano]]. In later stages, settlers might also have arrived in Espoo directly from Sweden, most likely from [[Svealand]]. The Swedish name for Espoo, ''Esbo'', dates from this period. The settlers changed the Finnish names used by the Tavastians to Swedish ones: for example [[Kauklahti]] became Köklax and [[Karvasmäki]] became Karvasbacka. The current Finnish names might also have changed from the original ones in this process. For example, the place name ''Välli'' might have been changed into ''Vällskog'', which has since led to the current Finnish name [[Velskola]].<ref name=":1"/> The Swedish settlements were so extensive that the entire area became Swedish-speaking, except for its northernmost part and possibly the Haapalahti-Mäkkylä area.<ref name=":1" />{{rp|147–148}}

[[Palynology|Palynological analyses]] indicate that agriculture was already practised in Espoo around the 11th century, but no historical records from the era survive.<ref name="History"/> Until the late 13th century, Espoo was part of a borderland region between the [[Finns proper|Southwestern Finns]] and Tavastian Finns. Some artefacts found in Espoo have also been traced to ancient [[Savonian people|Savo]]-[[Karelians (Finns)|Karelian]] Finnish costumes, and the Late Iron Age and Early Medieval women in the area have had similar jewellery as in the region around present-day [[Mikkeli]].<ref name="haggrén"/>{{rp|300–301}}

In the Middle Ages, there were about 70 village lots in Espoo. Ancient fields and many passageways have been discovered near the remains of ancient villages.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/> Espaby (at which site the [[Espoo manor]] was later founded) was probably the oldest Swedish-speaking village in the area. The name Espoo likely refers to the name of the river Espoonjoki (Swedish: Esboån, originally Espå / Espåå), which in turn is thought to have come from the [[aspen]] trees on the shores of the river (the Swedish word for "aspen" is ''äspe''). The name was first mentioned in 1431. Originally, the current river Gumbölenjoki was renamed Espoonjoki after the village located along the river. When a church was founded near the village of Södrik, the name Espoonjoki was given to a river running from lake Kirkkojärvi to Kauklahti.<ref>Mallat, Kaija (ed.): ''Kylä-Espoo – Espoon vanha asutusnimistö ja kylämaisema''. Centre for urban planning in Espoo 2008; pp. 35–38. {{ISBN|978-951-857-381-7}}.</ref>

Espoo became an independent parish in the 15th century. Previously Espoo had been a chapel parish under [[Kirkkonummi]]. The stone [[Espoo Cathedral]] was built in the 1480s by initiative from the peasants. Up to the 1670s the eastern parts of Espoo belonged to the [[Vantaa|Helsinki parish]], after which they were officially annexed to the Espoo parish and the ''[[slottslän]]'' of [[Raseborg]].<ref name="espoonhistoria"/>

After the [[Second Swedish Crusade|Second Crusade to Finland]], settlers from Sweden established permanent agricultural settlements in [[Uusimaa]]. Espoo was a subdivision of the [[Kirkkonummi]] congregation until 1486–1487. The oldest known document referring to Kirkkonummi is from 1330; Espoo as a subchapter has been dated to the 1380s, although the first document directly referring to Espoo is from as late as 1431. The construction of the [[Espoo Cathedral]], the oldest preserved building in Espoo, marks the independence of Espoo. Administratively, Espoo was a part of [[Uusimaa (historical province)|Uusimaa]]. When the province was split to Eastern and Western provinces governed from the Porvoo and [[Raseborg Castle|Raseborg castle]]s, respectively, the eastern border of the Raseborg province was in Espoo. The 13th-century road connecting the most important cities in Finland at that time, the [[King's Road (Finland)|King's Road]], passes through Espoo on its way from [[Stockholm]] via [[Turku]] and [[Porvoo]] to [[Vyborg|Viipuri]].

==== Gräsa manor ====
The oldest ''frälse'' stead in Espoo, the Gräsa manor, apparently received ''frälse'' rights in the late 15th century.<ref name="gräsa">[https://web.archive.org/web/20210125212509/https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Asuminen_ja_ymparisto/Kaavoitus/Nimisto/Nakokulmia_nimistoon/Grasan_tarina(98145) Gräsan tarina], city of Espoo. Accessed on 28 November 2020.</ref> Gräsa is one of the oldest settlements in Espoo and the oldest in southern Espoo, as it was probably founded already in the early 14th century as Swedish settlement moved inland. From the beginning, the settlement was located at the site of the current [[Olari Church, Espoo|Olari Church]] on both sides of the [[Gräsanoja]] river. The absence of Finnish names in the area reveals that the population was Swedish-speaking from the beginning.<ref name="gräsa"/>

==== Early modern period ====
[[File:EspoonKartano.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Manor in Espoo, founded by King [[Gustav I of Sweden]] in 1556. The current mansion was completed in 1797 and expanded in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discoveringfinland.com/attractions-culture/manors/ | title = Manors in Finland | last = | first = | date = | publisher = Discovering Finland | access-date= 7 April 2021 |quote=}}</ref>]]
In 1556, King [[Gustav Vasa]] decided to stabilize and develop the region by founding a royal mansion in Espoo. The government bought the villages of Espåby and [[Mankby]] (Finnish: ''Mankki'') and transferred the population elsewhere, and built the royal mansion in Espåby. (Mankby was eventually abandoned and was never repopulated.) The royal mansion housed the king's local plenipotentiary ([[vogt]]), and collected royal [[tax in kind]] paid by labour on the mansion's farm. The administrative centre [[Espoon keskus]] has grown around the church and the [[Espoo railway station]], but the municipality has retained a network-like structure to the modern day.

In the 16th century Espoo changed into a parish of many large farmsteads. The war between Sweden and [[Russia]] in the late 16th century attracted farmstead owners to found horse steads in hopes of reduced taxation. Horse stead owners were required to uphold a rider in the wars fought by the realm. In the late 17th century the crown had donated lands to noblemen with success in wars, and during a few decades, the lands in Espoo had been dealt to seven noble families.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/>

In the early 18th century the [[Great Northern War]] and the [[Great Wrath]] caused poverty among the people. During this time, many members of the estates in Espoo moved to Sweden. The foundation of [[Suomenlinna|Sveaborg]] in front of [[Helsinki]] increased the traffic in Espoo and many officers bought villas in Espoo. Construction of the fortress required transport of bricks from factories in Espoo. In the same century, agricultural novelties such as the [[potato]] and various fruits spread from the manor houses to the peasants.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/>

Throughout the 19th century, most of Espoo's inhabitants worked in agriculture. The population was around 4,000, while most of the people lived in over 60 small villages. Halfway through the century, almost 90% of the population spoke [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as their first language. The wealthy [[Estate (land)|estates]] and [[mansion]]s of the parish required [[maid]]s, [[farmworker|farmhands]] and [[tenant farmer]]s as their workforce to raise cattle, farm crops and raise vegetables in the [[kitchen garden]]s. Fishing was also common in the coastal areas. The [[Glims Farmstead Museum|Glims farmstead]] in Karvasmäki has been preserved as a museum to present rural life in Espoo during this period when industrial development was still minute in Finland.<ref name="History"/>

The rural community in Espoo began to change in the latter half of the 19th century. Some [[brickyard]]s had already been built in the 18th century on the grounds of Espoonkartano manor, located in the western part of the present-day city, but it was not until the [[Government reforms of Alexander II of Russia|economic reforms]] of [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]] that the [[Industrial Revolution]] started to gain momentum in Finland. As the Russo-Finnish trade legislation liberalized, new brickyards were established in [[Espoonlahti]] and [[Kauklahti]], as the shores of Espoo Bay provided high-quality [[clay]] for their use. The bricks were mostly carried with steamboats to the neighbouring [[Helsinki]], the growing capital city of the grand duchy.<ref name="History"/>

The most prominent industrial facility in 19th century Espoo was the [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] Bastvik Sawmill, founded in 1876.<ref name="Bastvikin saha"/> In addition to the growing lumber and brick industries, a [[joiner]]s' workshop was established on the island of Staffan in 1886.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Soukka">{{cite web | url = https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Asuminen_ja_ymparisto/Ymparisto_ja_luonto/Retkelle_luontoon/Kotikaupunkipolut/Espoonlahti/Soukanranta(75904) | title = Soukanranta | publisher = City of Espoo | language = Finnish | access-date = 7 April 2021 | archive-date = 24 March 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190324093101/https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Asuminen_ja_ymparisto/Ymparisto_ja_luonto/Retkelle_luontoon/Kotikaupunkipolut/Espoonlahti/Soukanranta(75904) | url-status = dead }}</ref> Staffan Island became a home for a highly skilled and renowned community of joiners, colloquially known as the "University of Espoo"<ref name="History"/> or the "University of Soukka".<ref name="Soukka"/>

[[World War I]] had an effect on the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] when the [[German Empire]] declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914.<ref>[https://www.onthisday.com/events/august/1 Historical Events on August 1], On This Day. Accessed on 27 November 2020.</ref> Russia immediately started preparing for war against Germany. At the start of the war, the main forces of the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] had been concentrated at [[Suomenlinna|Sveaborg]] in front of Helsinki.<ref name="linnoitus">[https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2014/09/29/helsinkia-kiertaa-1-maailmansodan-linnoitusketju-katso-kartta Helsinkiä kiertää 1. maailmansodan linnoitusketju – katso kartta!], [[YLE]]. Accessed on 20 December 2017.</ref> The Russian military feared that Germany would use southern Finland to attack [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], so Russia started building a [[Krepost Sveaborg|fortification chain]] of over 20 kilometres surrounding Helsinki to protect it.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/><ref name="linnoitus"/><ref name="kouvola">Kouvola, Karolina; Sipponen, Leena; Henttonen, Maarit; Valoranta-Saltikoff, Sanna; Heikkilä, Toni; Laamanen, Jaana; Nikkanen, Konsta: ''Sisällissodan aikaan Espoossa.'' City museum of Espoo 2018. {{ISBN|978-951-857-782-2}}.</ref>{{rp|16}} Construction of the fortification started in 1915 and took almost three years.

Construction of the fortification chain required a huge amount of workforce. The construction was led by the engineering administration of Saint Petersburg, but in practice, the actual work was led by the engineering military staff in Sveaborg. The local engineering office was located in [[Leppävaara]] in Espoo.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|17}} Although the Russian military tried to keep the construction of the fortification chain secret from the enemy, there are German intelligence reports with descriptions of the Russian fortification chain.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|19}}

Because of the lack of available workforce, the Russians turned to [[expropriation]] allowed by Russian military law. The manor houses in Espoo were ordered to send one man and one horse each to work on the construction. The total number of workforce at the fortification is not known, but the expropriation resulted in 4000 men, of which 1300 were situated in [[Leppävaara]] and 1500 in [[Tapiola]] in June 1916.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|17}}

16-year-old Annukka Koskinen who lived at the Bergans farm in [[Suur-Leppävaara]] wrote about the expropriation in June 1916:<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|19}}
<blockquote>It was really shameless. Last year [the Russians] took control of three large buildings, and they would have taken the last one too, had we not complained to the office of the governor. For all of summer, they built fortifications all over the hill. Trees were cut down and new ones planted in their place. You know that only very few of these newly planted trees will survive. – This spring, [the soldiers] have shot at our fields during practice. Two days ago we received an order that the house, the large woodshed and the sauna have to be empty by noon on the next day.</blockquote>

The [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 stopped work at the fortification.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/><ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|20}} Finland declared [[Independence of Finland|its full independence]] in December 1917, and the fortifications were never actually needed to protect Saint Petersburg from a German attack. The fortifications only ever saw action in one battle during the [[Finnish Civil War]], when the red forces in Leppävaara fought the German forces who had come to the aid of the whites on 14 April 1918. The fortifications were later used as ammunition storage and civil protection during [[World War II]].<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|20}}

=== Finnish Civil War ===
==== Power vacuum ====
[[File:Baltic Sea Division in Leppävaara.jpg|thumb|right|German soldiers in [[Leppävaara]] in 1918]]
After the [[February Revolution]] in 1917, Finland went through a power vacuum. The imperial rule had fallen, general order had broken and the police had been dispensed.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|9, 44}} Upholding the general order moved to a local level, and local militias, citizens' guards, fire brigades and security forces were founded. These forces were not originally founded for military purposes but to uphold the general order. The activity was voluntary-based, and the forces were organised for example during strikes.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|44}}

In autumn 1917 the nature of the organisation became more military and the number of local workers' guards increased rapidly. The armed organisation was influenced by an acute lack of food, disappointment with the loss of the majority position of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]] at the [[1917 Finnish parliamentary election]], the Senate's desire for renovation, the fight for municipal power and fear of an armed uprising of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|44}}

===== Red and White Guards in Espoo =====
In Espoo, particularly [[Leppävaara]] was a restless area. The workers' association of Alberga founded an unarmed militia of ten people to uphold the general order. During summer and early autumn in 1917 there were local conflicts between the bourgeois guards and the workers' militia. In middle November the guards in Espoo on both sides had already started arming themselves.

In July 1917 the first bourgeois order guard was founded in [[Kauklahti]], under the guise of a voluntary fire brigade. A little later a similar organisation was founded in [[Kilo, Espoo|Kilo]], and these organisations joined forces in August to September.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|56}} The guards had about 160 members in total at this point.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|57}}

After the [[Finnish Civil War]] had broken out, many young men left Espoo to join the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] all over the countryside in Uusimaa. The most important of these was the Sigurds Guard in [[Kirkkonummi]], of whose members 40 came from Espoo.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|48}}

==== Red Espoo ====
At the start of the Civil War in January 1918, the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] took control of Espoo. There were no actual battles between the Reds and the Whites during the revolution, as Espoo was in practice already under Red control.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|57}} Municipal power was transferred from the municipal council and the municipal board to a social democratic municipal organisation. The Reds took control without bloodshed and strengthened their position by sending patrols all around Espoo to confiscate any weapons found in the houses they visited.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|45}}

By order from the [[Finnish People's Delegation]], a revolutionary court was founded in Espoo, with the Kauklahti-based worker Aleksi Aronen serving as its judge. The court sessions were held in Villa Odenwald in [[Kauniainen]]. Most of the sentences given by the court were prison sentences or fines. In addition, the Red Guard in Leppävaara had its own comrade court. The general staff of the Red Guard in Uusimaa had installed a [[curfew]] forbidding going outside after nine o'clock in the evening. Meetings were held in workers' houses assembling lists to provide support for the Red Guards. Patrols consisting of young men looking for food and weapons could take justice in their own hands in the typical form of red terror.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|46}} In the spring, the Reds killed nine people in Espoo, of which six were civilians. Rumours of these acts of violence spread out, spreading fear among the people. Many people saw the municipal rule of the Reds as a reign of terror.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|47}}

During the Civil War, many bourgeois people in Espoo, whom the Reds in power saw as a threat, fled to neighbouring municipalities, hidden cabins in the archipelago or forests in northern Espoo. For example, Hans Heimbürger, the speaker of the Espoo municipal council, fled to [[Degerö, Inkoo|Degerö]] in [[Inkoo]] in January together with his family. Two people from Espoo are said to have fled into caves to flee from the Red power.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|58}}

==== After the war ====
The damages of the Civil War in Espoo were minimal, except for one primary school which had been hit by German bombing.<ref>[http://espoonperinneseura.net/perinnetieto/Autonomiasta-itsenaisyyteen.html Autonomiasta itsenäisyyteen], Traditional council Aurora. Accessed on 17 December 2017.</ref> However, many houses in Espoo suffered from famine after the Civil War. The war had cut off a large part of the foreign trade in Finland, which worsened the famine. Particularly the price of grain and other necessary foodstuffs had risen significantly, which caused price limits for the most important products. The situation eased out in 1919, but food regulation was only finally discontinued in 1921.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|41}}

After the end of the war, the White Guards went out to look for Reds fled into the forests in Espoo for a long time. In June 1918 the White Guards appealed to the municipal council of Espoo to ask for funds to travel to prison camps in order to provide expert help in judging reds from Espoo. 12 members of the Red Guard in Espoo had been sent to prison camps.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|42–43}}

Under the 1918 peasant law, peasants were freed from the power of their private masters, which led to a widespread settlement of steadless population in Finland. From 1919 to 1925 about 150 peasants and crofters in Espoo bought land for themselves with the grant given by the Finnish state. The new farms thus acquired still remained small, which caused the need to acquire further income through forestry and handyman work.<ref name="kouvola"/>{{rp|42–43}}

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Kauklahti 1920.jpg|thumb|right|[[VR Class Vk3]] steam locomotive at [[Kauklahti railway station]] in the 1920s]]
[[File:Moderne architectuur in Helsinki, Bestanddeelnr 920-4662.jpg|thumb|right|The so-called "[[Hip flask houses]]" in Tapiola were built from 1959 to 1961. This picture is from 1967.]]
In 1920, Espoo was only a rural municipality of about 9,000 inhabitants, of whom 70% were Swedish speaking. Agriculture was the primary source of income, with 75% of the population making their living from farming.{{cn|date=June 2023}}

[[Kauniainen]] was separated from Espoo in 1920,<ref>[https://www.hs.fi/paakirjoitukset/art-2000004593168.html 550-vuotias Espoo on kasvanut aikuiseksi] – ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' (in Finnish)</ref> and it gained city rights the same year as Espoo, in 1972. However, the border between Espoo and Kauniainen was only defined in the late 1940s.

Espoo started to grow rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s. Shortly after the end of the [[Continuation War]], the population of Espoo grew by four thousand as frontline soldiers and evacuees from [[Moscow Armistice|ceded territories]] (including the [[Porkkalanniemi]] peninsula, leased to the Soviet Union between 1944 and 1956) were settled in the city.<ref name="väliaho">Väliaho, Tuomo: [https://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/espoo/art-2000009026829.html Vielä 1960-luvulla Espoota pidettiin "villinä läntenä", jossa olivat omat lait ja käytöstavat – Silloin kyti juonittelu, jollaista ei oltu ennen nähty], ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' 28 August 2022. Accessed on 29 August 2022.</ref>

Espoo's location right next to the capital city of [[Helsinki]] attracted people working in the capital city to move into the rapidly growing neighbour city, and already before [[World War II]] there were many suburbs along the [[Rantarata]] railway, such as [[Leppävaara]], [[Kilo, Espoo|Kilo]] and [[Kauklahti]] which had formed into an industrial area. After the new Jorvaksentie road (predecessor to the [[Länsiväylä]] highway) was completed, new detached houses were built along it, particularly in [[Westend, Espoo|Westend]]. After the war, many detached houses for soldiers having fought at the frontline were built in Espoo. The highest increase in population only started in the early 1950s when the Asuntosäätiö foundation started construction of the garden city of [[Tapiola]], and construction of a new campus area of the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] started in the neighbouring district of [[Otaniemi]].

In the 1940s and 1950s Espoo grew more rapidly than it could afford. The infrastructure of Espoo was not prepared to handle such rapid growth. There was no time for proper [[zoning]], instead new houses were built as people bought lots in the city.<ref name="väliaho"/>

A major change happened in the late 1940s as the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] moved from [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] in [[Helsinki]] to larger premises in [[Otaniemi]], and the planning of the [[Tapiola]] garden city district was started. As the city did not have enough money to fund the construction of the student village in Otaniemi, the [[teekkari|technical university students]] took to the matter to their own hands, both by gathering money through various activities and taking part in the actual construction. About 800 thousand bricks from the Embassy of the Soviet Union in Helsinki, which had been destroyed in the [[bombing of Helsinki in World War II|bombing of Helsinki]], were used to build student apartments in Otaniemi.<ref name="väliaho"/>

From 1944 to 1956 the Espoonlahti bay between Espoo and Kirkkonummi served as the border of the [[Porkkala Naval Base]] under the control of the [[Soviet Union]]. A large part of Kirkkonummi, as well as a narrow strip of the sea and a couple of islands in Espoo were included in the area of the naval base. In Espoo, the [[Kauklahti railway station]] near the border to the naval base became a tightly controlled border station between Finland and the Soviet Union. The land connection to Porkkala went via the Kivenlahti bridge. During the time of the naval base, part of the western coast had been evacuated, and the windows of the houses in the border villages on the Soviet side had to be covered during night time. The windows of the trains travelling through the area rented to the Soviet Union had to be covered with wooden hatches from the outside for the duration of passage through Soviet territory, and could only be reopened upon reentry to Finland.

Unlike the neighbouring city of Helsinki, Espoo failed to develop a proper city centre, forming instead into an area of multiple centres. This was partly because a 1968 zoning plan where Espoo was divided into four separate areas, with the administrative centre situated in Muurala (later known as [[Espoon keskus]]), partly because most of the land in Espoo was not actually owned by the city but was instead in private ownership, directing new construction to wherever it was possible instead of using a proper zoning plan.<ref name="väliaho"/>

The rather tightly populated districts of [[Tapiola]] and [[Leppävaara]] in eastern Espoo underwent attempts to separate from the city of Espoo, from two directions: on the one hand, the inhabitants of the districts wanted them to become independent municipalities, while on the other hand, the neighbouring city of Helsinki wanted to annex the districts into Helsinki. These attempts all failed and the districts remained as part of Espoo, which changed from a rural municipality first to a [[market town]] in 1963 and then to a [[city]] in 1972.<ref name="väliaho"/> The new administrative centre of the city, [[Espoon keskus]], was built in the 1970s around the [[Espoo railway station]] and the old grey stone church in Espoo.

The non-centralised nature of Espoo led to significant differences between its districts. Different parts of Espoo included the wealthy garden city district of Tapiola, large areas that still remained as countryside, and new suburbs such as [[Haukilahti]], [[Karakallio]] and [[Soukka]]. Disagreements between different districts were common and gave Espoo a nationwide reputation of a quarrelsome municipality.<ref name="väliaho"/>

The city quickly developed from a rural municipality into a fully-fledged industrial city, gaining city rights in 1972. On 1 January 1972, when Espoo gained city rights, it had a population of over 100,000, making it into the fourth-largest city in Finland at the time, after [[Helsinki]], [[Turku]] and [[Tampere]].<ref name="väliaho"/>

Due to its proximity to Helsinki, Espoo soon became popular amongst people working in the capital. In the fifty years from 1950 to 2000, the population of Espoo grew from 22,000 to 210,000, mainly due to large-scale migration from other parts of Finland. Since 1945, the majority of people in Espoo have been Finnish-speaking. In 2006, the Swedish-speaking inhabitants represented barely 9% of the total population. The population growth is still continuing, but at a slower rate. In the summer of 2022, the population of Espoo grew to over 300,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-12515985|title=Espoolaisia on nyt 300 000 – kaupunginjohtaja Jukka Mäkelä kävi onnittelemassa tuoreinta espoolaista|first=Rosa|last=Lehtokari|work=[[Yle]]|date=29 June 2022|access-date=31 August 2022|language=fi}}</ref>

Many of the important roads in Finland go through Espoo. Finland's first highway, the [[Finnish national road 1]], was built in 1962. The [[Ring I]] beltway was also built in the 1960s. The next outer beltway, [[Ring II]], was taken into use in 2000.<ref name="espoonhistoria"/>

In the original plan for the centre of the [[Tapiola]] garden city, architect [[Aarne Ervi]] had reserved a space for a theatre building at the end of the fountain pool, but the theatre building was never built.<ref name="sipinen">[http://arksipinen.fi/fi/tyot/12-projektit/144-1989-espoon-kulttuurikeskus Espoon kulttuurikeskus 1989], ''Arkkitehtitoimisto Sipinen Oy''.

Two years later the first room program of the new building was completed, defining its needs and surface area. An architecture contest was held for its design in 1979. About 60 different proposals were submitted for the contest, with architect [[Arto Sipinen]]'s design ''Kuunsilta'' ("Moonlight bridge") being chosen as the winner. Construction of the [[Espoo Cultural Centre]] started in 1986. The foundation stone was laid on [[Jean Sibelius]] Day on 8 December. The building was constructed of [[quartz]] sand bricks, [[travertine]] tiles, glass and mosaic concrete, and its cost rose to about 130 million [[Finnish markka]].<ref name="sipinen"/><ref name="kulttuurikeskus">[https://web.archive.org/web/20201202223626/https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Kulttuuri_ja_liikunta/Kulttuuri/Kulttuurikeskukset_ja_tilat/Espoon_kulttuurikeskus/Esittely_ja_yhteystiedot/Historia_ja_arkkitehtuuri Espoon kulttuurikeskuksen historia ja arkkitehtuuri], city of Espoo.

=== Bedrock ===
The minerals and structures of the rocky and hilly topography of Espoo were formed about 1880 to 1650 million years ago. Particularly the [[Weichselian glaciation]] has had an effect on the current environment – the continental ice sheet withdrew from what is now Espoo about 13 thousand years ago. The first areas to surface from underneath the sea were the high hills in northern Espoo, such as Mustankorvenkallio.<ref name="kohteet">[http://docplayer.fi/512129-Espoon-arvokkaat-geologiset-kohteet-2006.html ESPOON ARVOKKAAT GEOLOGISET KOHTEET 2006], environmental centre of Espoo.

Main rock types in the Espoo bedrock include [[gneiss]], [[migmatite]], [[granite]], [[gabbro]], [[amphibolite]] and [[mica schist]]. Rare [[orbicular granite]] can be found in Nuuksio, the deposit is internationally valuable.<ref name="kohteet"/> At many places there are thick layers of [[clay]] on top of the bedrock, and fields were plowed onto clay-covered valleys. The thickness of the clay layers was mainly formed in the [[Baltic Ice Lake]] and the [[Yoldia Sea]].<ref name="kohteet"/>{{rp|12}} The effect of the bedrock on the traditional Espoo natural landscape was significant; high and steep cliffs stand up from shallowly waving fields. The oblong lakes in northern Espoo are located in valleys in the bedrock. The formation of the bedrock has determined the shapes of the coastline, such as Espoonlahti and Laajalahti. Because of upthrust, paludification of forests and overgrowth of lakes, [[bog]]s and layers of [[peat]] have formed on top of the clay at some places.<ref name="kallioperä"/>

=== Sea area ===
The sea area of Espoo is a considerably narrow strip between the sea areas of [[Helsinki]] and [[Kirkkonummi]].<ref name="selvitys">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160418012503/http://uudenmaanliitto.fi/files/15235/Uudenmaan_meri-_ja_rannikkoalueselvitys_E142-2014.pdf UUDENMAAN MERI- JA RANNIKKOALUESELVITYS], Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council. Accessed on 5 November 2017.</ref>{{rp|26}} The depth of the southern part of the sea area, in the outer archipelago, is a few dozen metres at the most. The ship route between Helsinki and [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] goes through the outermost parts of the sea area which contains small treeless, sea-washed [[islet]]s. One of them is the former fortification island of [[Kytö]]. The smallest islands are shallow islets, such as [[Stenskär]]. They are significant nesting grounds for birds and many of them are nature-protected areas. In summertime there might be flowering meadow patches on the islands. The islands closest to the Espoo shoreline include [[Stora Herrö]], [[Pentala]], [[Kopplorna]] and [[Lehtisaaret]]. The islands host many vacation buildings, and they are often referred to as an intermediary archipelago.<ref name="selvitys"/>{{rp|20}}

The islands in the inner archipelago are larger and lusher and contain boat harbours and buildings, as well as permanent settlements on the islands closest to the shore. There is a land connection from the mainland to the inhabited islands in [[Suvisaaristo]] and it forms a district of its own, with a more rural image than most of Espoo.

The sea area extends inland at many places as bays, of which the largest are Espoonlahti in the west and Laajalahti in the east. Bays on the shoreline between them include Nuottalahti, Haukilahti and Otsolahti. The bays are shallow and contain many islands, particularly in Espoonlahti. Most of the islands in Laajalahti are located across the municipal border in Helsinki. The largest peninsula in Espoo is [[Soukka]], fracturing into an archipelago in the south. Thus the peninsula hardly offers any views to the open sea. The nearest ship harbours are located in Helsinki, while the Espoo shoreline contains many small boat harbours, the largest being the boat harbour in [[Suomenoja]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20181202024624/https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Kulttuuri_ja_liikunta/Ulkoilu/Veneily/Venesatamat Venesatamat], city of Espoo. Accessed on 15 March 2019.</ref> The maritime traffic in front of Espoo mainly consists of motor boats of various sizes, water scooters and ferries handling traffic in the archipelago.

In terms of natural geography, the coastal waters of Espoo are divided into four different sea areas, consisting counting from the west of Espoonlahti, Suvisaaristo-Lauttasaari and Seurasaari. The fourth sea area is Helsinki-Porkkala to the south of the other three. The surface area of the Espoonlahti sea area is 19.2 square kilometres. The Espoonlahti nature preserve area is located in its northern part. The western part of the sea area is located in the neighbouring municipality of [[Kirkkonummi]]. The surface area of the Suvisaaristo-Lauttasaari sea area is 48.5 square kilometres. It reaches from the shores of the islands of Stora Herrö and Pentala up to the [[West Harbour, Helsinki|West Harbour]] in Helsinki. The surface area of the Seurasaari sea area is 13.1 square kilometres. The Laajalahti nature preserve area is located in its northwestern part. Most of the sea area is located in neighbouring Helsinki. The surface area of the Helsinki-Porkkala sea area is 400.5 square kilometres. It reaches from the eastern shore of the [[Porkkalanniemi]] peninsula up to [[Suomenlinna]] and [[Santahamina]]. Islands in the sea area include Kytö, Stenskär, [[Knapperskär]] and [[Gåsgrund]].<ref>[http://www.jarviwiki.fi/wiki/Espoo Espoo], environmental centre of Finland. Accessed on 12 October 2019.</ref>

=== Inland waters ===
There are over a hundred lakes and ponds in Espoo, of which 73 have an area of over a hectare.<ref name="paikkala"/>{{rp|5}}<ref name="jarviwiki">[http://www.jarviwiki.fi/wiki/Espoo Espoo], ''jarviwiki.fi''. Accessed on 9 September 2019.</ref> The lakes in Espoo were formed when the land slowly started rising after the continental ice sheet had thawed, and water started flowing into the crevices in the bedrock. The oldest lakes in Espoo are Kalatoin, Iso Majaslampi, Orajärvi and Pieni Majaslampi, all located over 80 metres above sea level. At that time, what is now the Baltic Sea was in a so-called [[Yoldia Sea]] phase, which had formed when the surface of the [[Baltic Ice Lake]] had lowered tens of metres in a short time. Nuuksio slowly expanded into part of the mainland and new lakes were formed when the sea level sank. Development stopped for about a millennium and a half when the ancient Baltic Sea changed into the [[Ancylus Lake]]. Its surface was originally about 60 metres above the current sea level. The Ancylus Lake formed into the salty [[Littorina Sea]] when the current [[Danish straits]] started opening up. The surface of the Littorina Sea was about 34 metres above the current sea level. At that time, almost all lakes in northern Espoo had been separated from the sea. Only the lake [[Nuuksion Pitkäjärvi]] remained as a narrow, [[fjord]]-like bay. The shore of the Littorina Sea remained at its place for a long time as upthrust slowed down. Rocky rims remain of the ancient sea shore on hills and cliffs. Nuuksion Pitkäjärvi only separated from the sea and became an inland lake about five millennia ago. About four millennia ago the land had risen so far that also [[Lake Bodom]], [[Lippajärvi]] and other pools in central Espoo changed from shallow bays into lakes.<ref name="paikkala"/>{{rp|15}}

Most of the lakes in Espoo are located to the north of the [[Finnish national road 1]], particularly in the lake highlands in Nuuksio. There are three pools named Pitkäjärvi ("long lake"): [[Pitkäjärvi]], Nuuksion Pitkäjärvi and [[Velskolan Pitkäjärvi]]. The largest lake in Espoo is [[Lake Bodom]] with a surface area of 4.1 square kilometres and an average depth of 4.3 metres.<ref name="järvien">[https://web.archive.org/web/20161028131718/http://www.espoo.fi/download/noname/%7BC89C4628-8F1E-4D99-B9E8-EC0D8657A3CD%7D/36868 Selvitys Espoon järvien tilasta], environmental centre of Uusimaa. Accessed on 9 November 2017.</ref>{{rp|50}} The largest depth of Nuuksion Pitkäjärvi is 18 metres and the average depth is 6.5 metres, and there are tens of lakes and ponds in its [[drainage basin]] of 60 square kilometres.<ref name="järvien"/>{{rp|37}} There are few lakes in southern Espoo. The shallow lake [[Hannusjärvi]] with a surface area of six hectares is located in [[Kaitaa]]<ref name="järvien"/>{{rp|53}} and the small lake [[Pentalanjärvi]] is located in the island of [[Pentala]].<ref name="järvien"/>{{rp|55}}

Because the sweet water pools to the south of the [[Salpausselkä]] ridges formed when the ancient bays separated from the sea into lakes because of upthrust, only very few islands developed in them.<ref name="paikkala"/>{{rp|15}} One of the few inland islands in Espoo is an island of fifteen hectares in the lake [[Saarijärvi, Espoo|Saarijärvi]] located near the border to Vihti. There was a suggestion to name the rocky island covered in pine forests as Partiosaari, but nothing became of this.<ref name="paikkala"/>{{rp|61}}

The differences in the surface heights of the lakes in Espoo are considerable. Lake Pieni Majaslampi is located the highest up, 97 metres above sea level. Lake Saarijärvi near it is located 25 metres lower. Because of the height differences, small rapids sometimes form in spring time in the creeks between adjacent water pools.<ref name="ahola">Ahola, Joel: ''Nuuksio: retkeilyopas & kartta''.

===Features===
Although Espoo is relatively highly populated, it has large amounts of the countryside and natural wilderness, particularly in the city's western and northern portions. The city has a total of 71 lakes, the largest of which are [[Lake Bodom]], Nuuksion Pitkäjärvi, Vanhankylän Pitkäjärvi, Loojärvi, Velskolan Pitkäjärvi, Saarijärvi, Matalajärvi, Siikajärvi, and Lippajärvi. The city has a large coastline on the [[Gulf of Finland]].

Espoo's location in the northern latitudes between the large continent of [[Eurasia]] and the even larger [[Atlantic Ocean]] causes rapid changes in the weather in Espoo. The height of the terrain from sea level also has an effect on the climate: most of the people in Espoo live south of Lake Bodom, where the terrain only rises over 50 metres above sea level in a few spots. There are no proper [[plateau]]s in northern Espoo either: the terrain rises a bit over 100 metres above sea level at the most.

Espoo is located in a hemiboreal zone, also known as the oak zone. The most important factor affecting the environment is the [[Gulf of Finland]], cooling the weather down in summer and warming it up in autumn. The coastal convergence increases rainfall going inward into the mainland. The local climate in Nuuksio is different from the rest of Espoo: the terrain in Nuuksio rises up from almost all directions, which causes a forced rise upwards in air currents, which in turn has an effect on the clouds. The ridge in Nuuksio has the highest rainfall in all of Finland. The climate in Nuuksio is also affected by the fractionate terrain, causing friction increasing rainfall. In 1981 the rainfall in [[Nupuri]] was measured as 1,109 millimetres, an all-time record in Finland.<ref name="avomereltä">[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/14910575.pdf Uusimaa ja Itä-Uusimaa – avomereltä Lohjanharjulle], [[Finnish Meteorological Institute]].

Although Espoo is the second-largest city in Finland, its meteorological averages have not been measured. At the weather stations in the neighbouring municipalities the average temperature from 1981 to 2010 was about 5 to 6 degrees Celsius. The coldest time of the year was from January to February and the warmest time was from July to August. The temperature differences between the seasons grow smaller when moving out towards the sea. On the coast and in the archipelago the temperature rarely rises above 30 degrees or falls below −20 degrees. The average rainfall is from 600 to 700 millimetres per year. The driest season is in springtime and the rainiest season is in August and from October to December. Most of the rainy days occur in autumn.<ref>[https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/35880/Tilastoja_Suomen_ilmastosta_1981_2010.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y TILASTOJA SUOMEN ILMASTOSTA1981-2010], [[Finnish Meteorological Institute]].

=== Snow conditions ===
On average, [[snow]] first falls on Espoo after Christmas and melts away from late March to early April. The snow conditions vary more on the coast than inland. On some years, the snow may last up to five months, while on some years, there might be hardly any snow during the entire winter. Lows coming from the southwest carry temperate air which can keep the snow layers thin or even melt the snow away.<ref name="avomereltä"/>

=== Winds ===
[[File:Olarinkatu Espoo 050519.jpg|thumb|right|Especially at springtime, the sea wind blows clouds into inland. This picture shows a view of the street Olarinkatu to the north. Birch trees usually grow dogears around May Day.]]
The dominant wind direction sector in Espoo is south-west, like in Finland in general.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200127182946/http://www.tuuliatlas.fi/tuulisuus Tuulisuus Suomessa]. Accessed on 5 May 2020.</ref> The sea wind has a large effect on the local winds on the coast, and can even create its own wind field. It can change the direction and speed of the basic wind on the coast for many times during the same day. Particularly in springtime and early summertime the sea wind keeps the archipelago and coastline free of clouds, while there is a white cloud wall further inland, which can cause rain showers.<ref>[https://blogi.foreca.fi/category/mobiilipalvelut/ Sään takaa], [[Foreca]]. Accessed on 5 May 2020.</ref>

=== Air quality ===
The air quality in Espoo is considerably good despite the negative effect of the traffic. Particularly on pedestrian roads, sand is used to combat slipperiness, which causes a major dust problem in springtime. Studded tires also contribute to the number of harmful particles. The air quality in Espoo is measured in [[Leppävaara]] and [[Luukki]]. There are also mobile measurement stations.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200415142859/https://www.espoo.fi/fi-FI/Asuminen_ja_ymparisto/Ymparisto_ja_luonto/Ymparistovalvonta/Ilmanlaatu Espoossa hengitetään hyvää ilmaa], city of Espoo.

=== Lighting conditions ===
Espoo is located at a latitude of 60 degrees north, which causes the duration of daylight to vary considerably. At summer solstice daylight lasts for nineteen hours, while at winter solstice it only lasts for six hours. The angle of the sun is at its highest at 53.4 degrees in summertime and only at 6.6 degrees in wintertime. Espoo is among the northernmost places to have nautical dusk even at summer solstice, meaning the sun is at least six degrees below the horizon at the darkest hour of the night.<ref name="timeanddate">[https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/finland/espoo Espoo, Finland — Sunrise, Sunset, and Daylength], Time and Date AS. Accessed on 22 April 2020.</ref> At that time, there is no total darkness during the entire night. In contrast, daylight at winter solstice is short, especially when there are only few sunny hours from November to January.<ref name="timeanddate"/>

Shadows cast by buildings are long even at summertime. They are at their shortest at summer solstice, about 75 percent of the height of the buildings. For example, the shadow of [[Niittyhuippu]] is 63 metres long at the time. At noon at winter solstice the shadows can be up to 8.8 times the height of the entire building. For example, the shadow of the [[Tapiola Central Tower]] is 430 metres long at the time.<ref>[https://rechneronline.de/sehwinkel/shadow-casting.php Calculate Shadow Casting: Length, Height, Altitude of the Sun], Jumk.de Webprojects. Accessed on 4 May 2020.</ref>

The official time in Espoo is measured by the 30th eastern [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. The city is located over five degrees west of it, so the solar noon occurs over 20 minutes later than on the 30th meridian.

The city of Espoo is officially [[bilingual]], with both [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as official languages. In 2023, the majority of the population, {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language Finnish|Espoo}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Espoo}}|1}}}} , spoke Finnish as their first language. There are {{formatnum: {{Data Finland municipality/native language Swedish|Espoo }} }} [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish speakers ]] in Espoo, or {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language Swedish|Espoo}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Espoo}}|1}}}} of the population.  The number of people who speak Sámi, Finland's third official language, is only {{formatnum: {{Data Finland municipality/native language Sami|Espoo }} }} inhabitants. In Espoo, {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language other|Espoo}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Espoo}}|1}}}} of the population speak a [[First language|mother tongue]] other than Finnish or Swedish.<ref name="statistics-finland-population-2023-final"/> As [[English language|English]] and Swedish – or Finnish for Swedish speakers – are compulsory school subjects, functional bilingualism or trilingualism acquired through language studies is not uncommon.<ref name="statistics-finland-population-2023-final"/>

The number of foreign language speakers in Espoo is lower than in Vantaa, but higher than in Helsinki. It is estimated that the number of foreign language speakers will increase to 30% of the city's population by 2030, and in 2027 it is estimated that almost half (43.3%) of people aged 35–64 in Espoo will be foreign language speakers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20210511201446/https://www.espoo.fi/download/noname/%7B8931E35D-D583-4D78-960A-E0CC4C04609A%7D/97364 Talousarvio 2018 sekä taloussuunitelma], city of Espoo.

The proportion of Swedish speakers decreased the most in the 1950s: in the 1950s, Swedish speakers accounted for 43.1% of the population (about 10,800 people<ref name="doria-vuosikirja">[https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/78743/xyti_stv_195100_1952_dig.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Suomen tilastollinen vuosikirja], doria.fi 31 December 1950.

The number of Swedish speakers increased slowly until the 2010s, when they numbered about 20,300, while the proportion decreased year by year. In 1996 the proportion fell below 10 per cent. In 2022, the proportion of Swedish speakers in Espoo was 6.6% of the population.

=== Economical history ===
[[File:Punainen talo.jpg|thumb|right|In addition to fields, many buildings remain of rural Espoo, such as the Punainen tupa ("red house") in [[Henttaa]].]]

Still in the middle 19th century, Espoo was a rural community living in subsistence economy. There was hardly any industry, the villages were small and situated evenly across different parts of the parish. There was some population concentration at the location of the current district of [[Espoon keskus]] and along the Suuri Rantatie road, and some dense population on the shore of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. In 1865 farming was the primary source of income for about 90% of the men in Espoo. There were about seventy craftsmen and about twenty people working in the industry. Of the women in Espoo, over one fifth worked as maids.<ref name="ikkala">Ikkala, Marja-Leena: ''Kylästä lähiöön (Espoo-sarja)''. City of Espoo 1989. {{ISBN|951-857-124-4}}.</ref>{{rp|48}}

The economical history of 19th-century Espoo also includes some small-scale [[mining]] activity. There was [[ore]] mining at the lands of the Kilo mansion around 1840, and this activity continued to the 1850s. The ore was of good quality but poor, and the ore streaks were fragmentary. In the end, the amount of ore mined from Kilo was very small.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|108}} A new discovery of ore was made at the lands of the Alberga manor in the early 1840s. At most seven people worked at the site, but the amount of ore mined in Alberga ended up very small as well. The mining activity slowly waned and stopped completely in 1851.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|116}}

The Espoo parish was not a neighbour of the city of Helsinki in the 19th century – there were lands of the [[Vantaa|Helsinki parish]] in between. The rapid growth of Helsinki attracted people from Espoo: despite the short distance, travel between Espoo and Helsinki was so slow, that moving into Helsinki was almost unavoidable if one happened to get a job there.<ref name="ikkala"/>{{rp|49}}

The rapid growth of Helsinki started also showing outside the administrative borders of the city. The first industrial area in Espoo was born near the shore of the Espoonlahti bay. In the late 19th century there were three brick factories and a steam-powered sawmill in the area. Clay from the Espoonlahti bay was well suited for making bricks, and the bricks were easy to transport to Helsinki over sea. For example, the [[Uspenski Cathedral]] in [[Katajanokka]] has been built from bricks from the Stensvik brick factory. The village of Mulby (Muulo in Finnish) became the industrial centre of Espoo, and its population grew manifold. Other villages in southwestern Espoo also grew through the industry. When the [[Rantarata]] railway was completed in the early 20th century part of the industry moved to the railway track, and the railway also enabled people to commute for work from Espoo to Helsinki.<ref name="ikkala"/>{{rp|49, 58}}<ref name="taskutilasto">[https://web.archive.org/web/20200919193848/https://www.espoo.fi/download/noname/%7B70281CC5-21A0-475E-BADB-132E88C4BD2A%7D/89512 Espoon kaupungin taskutilasto 2017], city of Espoo. Accessed on 13 November 2017.</ref>{{rp|7}}

There was also glass industry in Espoo. Pehr Appelgrén founded a bottle glass factory near the Espoo railway station in 1912. The factory closed down in 1922. The Kauklahti glass factory started in 1923, and by the 1930s it was the largest illumination glass factory in Finland. The factory closed down in 1951. Glass industry in Espoo altogether waned in the 1950s.<ref name="ikkala"/>{{rp|59, 60}}

By the late 1930s, there were about thirty businesses in Espoo. In addition to glass and brick industry, the parish included machinery workshops, sawmills and metallurgy workshops. There was industrial clothing manufacturing in [[Kauklahti]] and a clock factory in [[Viherlaakso]]. The steam-powered sawmill in Bastvik, founded in 1876, was economically quite stable; its saw equipment was moved to the [[Hanko Peninsula]] in the 20th century.<ref name="ikkala"/>{{rp|58–61}} The merchant F. F. Sjöblom founded the first shop in Espoo in Stensvik soon after founding of shops had been liberated in 1868. At the time when Finland became independent, there were about 40 shops in Espoo, most of them general stores.<ref name="ikkala"/>{{rp|62}}

Despite the increase in industry and service jobs, Espoo was still a predominantly rural parish in 1920. About two thirds of the population got their primary income from farming.<ref name="ikkala"/>{{rp|53}} [[Rye]] and [[barley]] had been the primary crops in Espoo for centuries. By the 20th century the significance of cattle herding increased, and the farming of [[oats]] became more popular.<ref name="ikkala"/>{{rp|32, 55}}

Construction and services became the basis of the economy in Espoo in the 1950s, when the rapid growth in population in Espoo started. In the 2010s, the primary industries counting by number of jobs are trade, accommodation and food and beverage industry as well as specialist services. The proportion of information and communications technology is about one tenth. About one sixth of the jobs are in industry and construction. The public sector is large: about one quarter of jobs were in the public sector in the middle 2010s.<ref name="taskutilasto"/>{{rp|17}}

The transition from a medieval rural parish into an integral part of the Helsinki metropolitan area has dropped the proportion of farming and forestry jobs to about a fifth of a percent.<ref name="taskutilasto"/>{{rp|17}}

The economy in Espoo leaves a surplus, but this is not enough to finance the investments of the growing city.<ref name="talous"/>

Espoo has signed the principles of responsible investment of the [[United Nations]]. The city of Espoo has five investment funds: the basic services and land acquisition fund, the development fund of basic services, the development fund of entrepreneurship and employment, the investment fund and the accident fund.<ref name="talous"/>

A characteristic feature of Espoo is that the city manages its investments through its daughter companies.<ref name="talous"/>

=== Income level ===
The average income level in Espoo is higher than that in the rest of the capital region and particularly higher than that in the rest of Finland. In 2015, the taxable income in Espoo was 40% higher than in the rest of Finland. The unemployment rate in Espoo is high, but still lower than the average in Finland.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200919193848/https://www.espoo.fi/download/noname/%7B70281CC5-21A0-475E-BADB-132E88C4BD2A%7D/89512 Espoon kaupungin taskutilasto 2017], pp. 15–16, city of Espoo. Accessed on 13 November 2017.</ref> The highest-income areas in Espoo, such as [[Westend, Espoo|Westend]] and [[Haukilahti]], are mainly located on the coast. These districts are part of the Tapiola major district, whose income level is significantly higher than the average in Espoo. The income level in the Matinkylä and Espoonlahti major districts is near the average in Espoo. The income level in the Leppävaara major district and particularly in the Vanha-Espoo major district is lower than the average in Espoo.<ref name="aluesarjat2017">[https://web.archive.org/web/20161007080816/http://www.aluesarjat.fi/?bmark=..%2FDATABASE%2FALUESARJAT_KAUPUNKIVERKKO%2FTULOTASO%2FASUNTOKUNTIEN%2A%3BTULOT%2FB03ESP_Ginikertoimet&lang=FI&qr=Alue%3A%22Tieto%3A%22Vuosi%3A&case=db Helsingin seudun aluesarjat], Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Helsinki Region Environmental Services and Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council.

The city of Espoo is not particularly segregated by major districts, instead the differences in income are significantly higher within the major districts as between them. In low-come major districts the average income level is near the average in Helsinki. In some areas, such as in [[Kivenlahti]] and [[Suvela]], it even falls below the average in Vantaa. Areas consisting of detached houses generally have higher income levels than areas consisting of apartment buildings.<ref name="aluesarjat2017"/>

== Culture ==
[[File:Tapiola culture centre.jpg|thumb|The [[Espoo Cultural Centre]]]]
[[File:Espoo Cultural Centre (December 2018).jpg|thumb|right|The Espoo Cultural Centre in nocturnal lighting in December 2018]]
[[File:WeeGee-talo.JPG|thumb|right|The [[WeeGee house]] in Tapiola, consisting of four different museums]]
Espoo hosts a Museum of Modern Art called [[EMMA (museum)|EMMA]] (Espoo Museum of Modern Art), built in a renovated old print house, the [[WeeGee house]], named after an old book print company Weilin & Göös. The same building hosts also Finland's only Museum of [[Horology]] ({{langx|fi|Kellomuseo}}, {{langx|sv|Urmuseum}}) and a Toy Museum. [[Glims Farmstead Museum]] is also located in the city. The [[Espoo cultural centre]], home of the world-renowned Tapiola Sinfonietta, where numerous concerts and theater performances are held, is located in [[Tapiola]] ({{langx|sv|Hagalund}}). The [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] Museum is located in Tarvaspää and the Haltia Nature Centre is located in Nuuksio.

Espoo has several old manors of which two are open to the general public. The most important is [[Espoon kartano]] ({{langx|sv|Esbo gård}}, Espoo Manor), first mentioned in maps in 1495, and belonging to the noble Ramsay family since 1756. The current main building dates back to 1914, but a mill dates from the 1750s and Finland oldest walled [[bridge|stone bridge]] from 1777 is on the [[King's Road (Finland)|King's Road]] ({{langx|fi|Kuninkaantie}}, {{langx|sv|Kungsvägen}}) which passes by the manor. The main building can be rented for weddings and similar occasions. Guided tours are available on request for groups. The other manor open to public is Pakankylän kartano, located on the northern shore of [[Lake Bodom]]. The manor hosts a restaurant and club rooms, partly with original furniture open to the public, but meant originally to [[Kaisankoti]] sanatory and old people's home located on ground of the manor.

The Metal band [[Children of Bodom]] comes from Espoo, Finland. They are named after the unsolved murder known as the [[Lake Bodom murders]] which took place at the shore of [[Lake Bodom]], a lake in northern Espoo, in 1960. The bands [[Norther (band)|Norther]] and [[Kiuas]] also come from Espoo.

The educational department took part in [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 in Finland]].

Authors in Espoo include [[Antti Hyry]] and [[Mauri Kunnas]]. [[Arto Paasilinna]], known for his comical narrative, was nominally Espoo's prosaist. Of his novels, ''Elämä lyhyt, Rytkönen pitkä'' ("Life is short, Rytkönen is tall") features the districts of [[Tapiola]] and [[Haukilahti]], ''Aatami ja Eeva'' ("Adam and Eve") features [[Otaniemi]] and ''Herranen aika'' ("Oh my God") features [[Jorvi]].

=== Events ===

The cultural landscape in Espoo started developing in river valleys and on plantations cleared on bays revealed by upthrust of land. The largest plantations were already in the map drawn in the middle 18th century mainly in the same form as in the late 20th century. Tightly built, small groups of buildings started developing on the edges of the plantations, at some places also on hills in between them. The large landscape of Snettans and Röylä stretches to the north of Lake Bodom, with the Pakankylä manor located in its southern part. There is a significant landscape to the west of the Espoo manor,<ref name="härö">Härö, Erkki: ''Espoon rakennuskulttuuri ja kulttuurimaisemat: Byggnadskulturen och kulturlandskapet i Esbo.''

The large cultural landscape of Bemböle-Karvasmäki is located to the northeast of [[Espoon keskus]] and the clearly defined landscape of [[Söderskog]] is located to the south of it.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|83, 140}} The well preserved village landscape of Gammelgård is located on the shore of lake [[Pitkäjärvi]] in eastern Espoo.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|258}}

The most historically valuable landscape is located at Espoonjokilaakso near the [[Espoo Cathedral]]. The valley, surrounded by steep cliffs, was probably cleared for plantation use already in ancient times. As well as the cathedral, the landscape includes many other culturally significant buildings.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|63}}

The typical rural village in Espoo was small: two or three houses in an asymmetric group on a hill. A notable exception was the village of Gammelgård: the village had thirteen houses in 1540. Because of the small number houses, the [[Great Partition (Sweden)|Great Partition]] in the late 18th century had little effect on the traditional cultural landscape in Espoo. The building tradition in Espoo remained old-fashioned for a long time: low paired houses were common up to the late 19th century. The storm in August 1890 brought upon a change, when new buildings according to the style at the time were built from thousands of logs felled by the storm.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|10–11}}

Manor houses started appearing when one of the houses of the village grew larger than the others and developed into a riding farm, which ended up as property of the gentry. Thus almost all of the manor houses in Espoo are located at the site of an old peasant village. The Espoo manor was founded at the start of the new era, but most of the manor houses in Espoo had formed without an official founding in the late 18th century. The officers in [[Suomenlinna]] bought farms near Helsinki, resulting in so-called officer manor houses such as Bodom, Hovgård and Träskända. The late Carolinian appearance of the main buildings of the manor houses has been preserved the best in Bodom and Backby. The manor houses in Alberga and Kilo represent the style ideals of the late 19th century, while Träskända represents the start of the 20th century.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|10–11}}

The owners of the manor houses started selling their lands to the municipality and to construction enterprises in the 20th century. The manor houses in southern Espoo were mostly torn down to make way for new buildings and roads. The medieval Gräsa manor, the only so-called old ''frälse'' in Espoo, was located in the Olari area. Gräsa is seen as a textbook example of the rapid and fundamental change in the cultural landscape in Espoo.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|157}} The main buildings of the [[Hagalund manor|Hagalund]] and Matinkylä manor remain, while hardly anything remains of the Frisans and Finno manors.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|162–163, 205, 311}} The Soukanpohja manor is the only manor house in Espoo to remain as a contiguous group of buildings. It also forms a small rural landscape in the middle of new development in the late 20th century.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|170–171}}

The effect of the roads on the cultural landscape of Espoo is indisputable. Villages were founded along the [[King's Road (Finland)|King's Road]] and the road brought cultural influences along with it. The rural landscapes in Espoo started gradually changing in the late 19th century as new villas were founded on the coast because of regular steamship traffic. There is a well preserved summer villa milieu on the island of [[Iso Vasikkasaari]]. Many of the villas are known by their famous architects or commissioners, such as [[Villa Carlstedt]] designed by [[Lars Sonck]].<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|10–11}}

Many villas were also founded in [[Kilo, Espoo|Kilo]] and [[Leppävaara]]. The [[Karhusaari Art Centre|Karhusaari villa]] was built in southeastern Espoo in the 1890s, as well as [[Villa Rulludd]] in [[Kaitaa]].<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|167, 201}} The first villas in [[Suvisaaristo]] were built on the island of [[Tallholm]] in the 1860s, before that the area had mostly consisted of fishing villages.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|179}} The most architecturally valuable villa in Espoo is [[Villa Miniato]] in [[Soukka]].<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|172}}

The [[Pasila]]-[[Karjaa]] railway, completed in 1903, had a significant impact on the cultural landscape of Espoo. Industrial buildings were built near the railway stations, attracting working class settlements. The first suburban areas also appeared along the railway: [[tuberculosis]] was a common cause of death among the Finns in the early 20th century, and the dry and bright hills in Espoo along with the pines growing on them were seen as suitable to prevent and treat the disease. Espoo was seen as a healthy alternative to Helsinki, but new settlement coming from the east was diverse and new residential areas were very different from each other. The city of [[Kauniainen]] developed into a showy area, while the district of [[Leppävaara]] developed into a more modest one.<ref name="härö"/>{{rp|11–12}}
