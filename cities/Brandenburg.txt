'''Brandenburg''', officially the '''State of Brandenburg''' (see [[#Names|Names]]), is a [[states of Germany|state]] in northeastern [[Germany]]. Brandenburg borders [[Poland]] and the states of [[Berlin]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Saxony]]. It is the [[List of German states by area|fifth-largest German state by area]] and the [[List of German states by population|tenth-most populous]], with 2.5 million residents. [[Potsdam]] is the state capital and largest city. Other major towns are [[Cottbus]], [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] and [[Frankfurt (Oder)]].

Brandenburg surrounds the national capital and city-state of [[Berlin]]. Together they form the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deutsche-metropolregionen.org/metropolregion/berlin-brandenburg/|title=Berlin-Brandenburg &#124; IKM|date=31 August 2020}}</ref> the third-largest [[Metropolitan regions in Germany|metropolitan area in Germany]]. There was [[Fusion of Berlin and Brandenburg#1996 fusion attempt|an unsuccessful attempt to unify both states in 1996]] and the states still cooperate on many matters.

Brandenburg originated in the [[Northern March]] in the 900s AD, from areas conquered from the [[Wends]]. It later became the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], a major principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the 15th century, it came under the rule of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], which later established [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the core of the later [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. From 1815 to 1947, Brandenburg was a [[Province of Brandenburg|province]] of [[Prussia]].

Following the [[abolition of Prussia]] after [[World War II]], Brandenburg was established as [[State of Brandenburg (1947–1952)|a state]] by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]]. In 1952, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved the state and broke it up into multiple [[Administrative divisions of East Germany|regional districts]]. After [[German reunification]], Brandenburg was re-established in 1990 as one of the five [[New states of Germany|new states]] of the Federal Republic.

Southeastern Brandenburg contains part of the historical [[Lower Lusatia]], and most of these localities have two official languages, [[German language|German]] and [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]] (of the [[Sorbs|Sorbs/Wends]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Das sorbische Volk |url=https://www.politische-bildung-brandenburg.de/themen/das-sorbische-volk |website=Brandenburgische Landeszentrale für politische Bildung}}</ref>

==Names==
Brandenburg takes its name from [[Brandenburg an der Havel]].

==History==
{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}
In late medieval and early modern times, Brandenburg was, with varying borders, one of seven [[prince-elector|electoral states]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and, along with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], formed the original core of the [[German Empire]], the first unified German state. Governed by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]] from 1415, it contained the future German capital Berlin. After 1618 the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] were combined to form [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], which was ruled by the same branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. In 1701 the state was elevated as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Franconian [[Nuremberg]] and [[Ansbach]], Swabian [[Burg Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], the eastern European connections of Berlin, and the status of Brandenburg's ruler as [[prince-elector]] together were instrumental in the rise of that state.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Northern March}}
Brandenburg is situated in territory known in antiquity as [[Magna Germania]], which reached to the Vistula river. By the 7th century, [[Slavic peoples]] are believed to have settled in the Brandenburg area. The Slavs expanded from the east, possibly driven from their homelands in present-day Ukraine and perhaps Belarus by the invasions of the [[Huns]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. They relied heavily on river transport. The two principal Slavic groups in the present-day area of Brandenburg were the [[Hevelli]] in the west and the [[Sprevane]] in the east.

Beginning in the early 10th century, [[Henry the Fowler]] and his successors conquered territory up to the [[Oder River]]. Slavic settlements such as Brenna<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barford|first=Paul M.|title=The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|year=2001|pages=421|isbn=0-8014-3977-9}}</ref> ([[Brandenburg an der Havel]]), Budusin<ref>{{Cite book|last=Institut für Sorbische Volksforschung in Bautzen|title=Lětopis Instituta za serbski ludospyt|publisher=Domowina|location=Bautzen|year=1962}}</ref> ([[Bautzen]]), and Chośebuz<ref>{{Cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Placenames of the World|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson|year=2006|pages=433|isbn=0-7864-2248-3}}</ref> ([[Cottbus]]) came under [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] control through the installation of margraves. Their main function was to defend and protect the eastern [[marches]]. In 948 Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] established margraves to exert imperial control over the pagan Slavs west of the Oder River. Otto founded the Bishoprics of [[Diocese of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[Bishopric of Havelberg|Havelberg]]. The [[Northern March]] was founded as a northeastern border territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, a great uprising of [[Wends]] drove imperial forces from the territory of present-day Brandenburg in 983. The region returned to the control of Slavic leaders. The eastern parts of current Brandenburg, i.e. the [[Lubusz Land]] and [[Lower Lusatia]], became part of Poland in the 10th-11th centuries.

===Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}

[[File:Bad Belzig asv2022-07 img13 Burg Eisenhardt.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenhardt Castle in [[Bad Belzig]]]]
In the early 12th century, the Slavic [[Duchy of Kopanica]] was established in the central part of present-day Brandenburg, whereas the [[Lubusz Land]] in the east remained part of medieval Poland. During the 12th century, the German kings and emperors re-established control over the Slav-inhabited lands of present-day Brandenburg, excluding Polish-controlled Lubusz Land, although some Slavs like the [[Sorbs]] in [[Lusatia]] adapted to [[Germanization]] while retaining their distinctiveness. The Roman Catholic Church brought [[bishoprics]] which, with their walled towns, afforded protection from attacks for the townspeople. With the monks and bishops, the history of the town of [[Brandenburg (town)|Brandenburg an der Havel]], which was the first center of the state of Brandenburg, began.

In 1134, in the wake of a German [[Northern Crusade|crusade]] against the [[Wends]], the German magnate, [[Albert the Bear]], was granted the [[Northern March]] by the Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]]. He formally inherited the town of Brandenburg and the lands of the Hevelli from their last Wendish ruler, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]], in 1150. After crushing a force of Sprevane who occupied the town of Brandenburg in the 1150s, Albert proclaimed himself ruler of the new [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. Albert, and his descendants the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], then made considerable progress in conquering, colonizing, Christianizing, and cultivating lands as far east as the Oder. Within this region, Slavic and German residents intermarried. During the 13th century, the Ascanians began acquiring and seizing territory around and east of the Oder from Poland ([[Lubusz Land]] and north-western [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]]), later known as the [[Neumark]], in contrast to the [[Altmark]], the cradle of the March of Brandenburg.

In 1320, the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end, and from 1323 up until 1415 Brandenburg was under the control of the [[Wittelsbach]]s of [[Bavaria]], followed by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] Dynasties. Under the Luxembourgs, the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] gained the status of a [[prince-elector]] of the Holy Roman Empire. In the period 1373–1415, Brandenburg was a part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]]. In 1415, the Electorate of Brandenburg was granted by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] to the [[House of Hohenzollern]], which would rule until the end of World War I. The Hohenzollerns established their capital in Berlin, by then the economic center of Brandenburg.

===16th and 17th centuries===
{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia}}
[[File:Schlacht bei Fehrbellin2.JPG|thumb|Brandenburg's victory over Swedish forces at the [[Battle of Fehrbellin]] in 1675]]
Brandenburg converted to Protestantism in 1539 in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]], and generally did quite well in the 16th century, with the expansion of trade along the Elbe, Havel, and Spree rivers. The Hohenzollerns expanded their territory by co-rulership since 1577 and acquiring the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1618, the [[Duchy of Cleves]] (1614) in the [[Rhineland]], and territories in [[Westphalia]]. The result was a sprawling, disconnected country known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] that was in poor shape to defend itself during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

Beginning near the end of that devastating conflict, however, Brandenburg enjoyed a string of talented rulers who expanded their territory and power in Europe. The first of these was [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the so-called "Great Elector", who worked tirelessly to rebuild and consolidate the nation. He moved the royal residence to [[Potsdam]]. At the [[Peace of Westphalia]], his envoy [[Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal]] negotiated the acquisition of several important territories such as [[Halberstadt]]. Under the [[Treaty of Oliva]] Christoph Caspar [[von Blumenthal]] (son of the above) negotiated the incorporation of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] into the Hohenzollern inheritance.

===Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire===
{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia|Province of Brandenburg}}
[[File:Potsdam Sanssouci Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sanssouci|Sanssouci Palace]] in [[Potsdam]], the former summer palace of [[Frederick the Great]], is today a [[World Heritage Site]].]]
When Frederick William died in 1688, he was followed by his son [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], third of that name in Brandenburg. As the lands that had been acquired in Prussia were outside the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick assumed (as Frederick I) the title of "[[King in Prussia]]" (1701). Although his self-promotion from margrave to king relied on his title to the Duchy of Prussia, Brandenburg was still the most important portion of the kingdom. However, this combined state is known as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

[[File:Brandenburg superimposed on modern borders.svg|thumb|200px|The [[Province of Brandenburg]], as superimposed on modern borders]]
Brandenburg remained the core of the Kingdom of Prussia, and it was the site of the kingdom's capitals, Berlin and Potsdam. When Prussia was subdivided into provinces in 1815, the territory of the Margraviate of Brandenburg became the [[Province of Brandenburg]], again subdivided into the [[Regierungsbezirk Frankfurt|government region of Frankfurt]] and Potsdam. It also included [[Lower Lusatia]], previously ruled at various times by Poland, [[Bohemian Crown|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]. In 1881, the City of Berlin was separated from the Province of Brandenburg.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Berlin |display=Berlin § ''Government Administration and Politics'' |volume=3 |page=778}}</ref> However, industrial towns ringing Berlin lay within Brandenburg, and the growth of the region's industrial economy brought an increase in the population of the province. The Province of Brandenburg had an area of {{convert|39039|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and a population of 2.6 million (1925).

Under the [[Nazi government]] and during [[World War II]], repressions of [[Polish people|Poles]], especially autochthones in the eastern part of the province, intensified with [[Expulsion of Poles by Germany|expulsions of Poles]], censorship of Polish newspapers, invigilation, arrests and [[assassination]]s of Polish leaders, activists, teachers, entrepreneurs, editors, etc., deportations to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and closure of Polish organizations, enterprises, schools and libraries.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cygański|first=Mirosław|year=1984|title=Hitlerowskie prześladowania przywódców i aktywu Związków Polaków w Niemczech w latach 1939-1945|journal=Przegląd Zachodni|language=pl|issue=4|pages=45–46, 49–51, 53–54}}</ref> The [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] with a network of [[List of subcamps of Sachsenhausen|subcamps]] was located in Brandenburg, and several [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camps]], including [[Stalag III-A]], Stalag III-B, [[Stalag III-C]], [[Stalag III-D]], [[Oflag II-A]], Oflag III-A, Oflag III-B, [[Oflag III-C]], Oflag 8 and Oflag 80 for Polish, Belgian, British, Dutch, [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]], Serbian, [[Italian Military Internees|Italian]], American, Czechoslovak, Soviet, Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] POWs with numerous [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] subcamps.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945.

The entire population of former East Brandenburg was [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expelled en masse]] in accordance with the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. The remainder of the province became a state in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany]] when Prussia was dissolved in 1947.

===East Germany ===
[[File:Glienicke Bridge GB23840.jpg|thumb|[[Glienicke Bridge]], which connected East Germany to the American sector of West Berlin, became known for the exchange of captured spies.]]
After the foundation of [[East Germany]] in 1949, Brandenburg formed one of its component states. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the [[Council of Ministers of the GDR|Socialist government of East Germany]], doing away with all component states. The East German government then divided Brandenburg among several ''Bezirke'' or districts. (See [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic]]). Most of Brandenburg lay within the [[Cottbus (Bezirk)|Bezirke of Cottbus]], [[Frankfurt (Bezirk)|Frankfurt]], or [[Potsdam (Bezirk)|Potsdam]], but parts of the former province passed to the [[Schwerin (Bezirk)|Schwerin]], [[Neubrandenburg (Bezirk)|Neubrandenburg]] and [[Magdeburg (Bezirk)|Magdeburg districts]] (town [[Havelberg]]). East Germany relied heavily on [[lignite]] (the lowest grade of coal) as an energy source, and lignite strip mines marred areas of south-eastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.

===Federal Republic of Germany===
The present State of Brandenburg was re-established on 3 October 1990 upon [[German reunification]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ländereinführungsgesetz (1990)|url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/ddr90-laeeinf.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040529223646/http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/ddr90-laeeinf.htm|archive-date=29 May 2004|language=de}}</ref> The newly elected Landtag of Brandenburg first met on 26 October 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/ |title=Historischer Kalender - 20 Jahre Land Brandenburg |access-date=26 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411062741/http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/ |archive-date=11 April 2010}}</ref> As in other former parts of East Germany, the lack of modern infrastructure and exposure to West Germany's competitive market economy brought widespread unemployment and economic difficulty. In the recent years, however, Brandenburg's infrastructure has been modernized and unemployment has slowly declined.

====Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt====
{{Main|Fusion of Berlin and Brandenburg}}
[[File:DEU Berlin-Brandenburg COA.svg|thumb|upright|The coat of arms proposed in the interstate treaty]]
The legal basis for a combined state of [[Berlin]] and Brandenburg is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] stipulates that states may only merge after a specific federal Act of Parliament is enacted.<ref>{{cite act |type= |index= |date=24 May 1949 |article=29 |article-type=Article |legislature=Parlamentarischer Rat |title=Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland |trans-title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany |page= |url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_29.html |language=de}}</ref> However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows Berlin and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.<ref>{{cite act |type= |index= |date=27 October 1994 |article=118a |article-type=Einzelnorm |legislature=Bundestag |title=Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland |trans-title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany |page= |url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_118a.html |language= de}}</ref>

In 1996, an attempt of unifying the states of Berlin and Brandenburg was rejected at referendum.<ref name="berlingeschichte">{{Cite web|title=LÄNDERFUSION / FUSIONSVERTRAG (1995) |url=https://berlingeschichte.de/stadtentwicklung/texte/5_33_laefuver.htm |year=2004 |access-date=31 March 2022}}</ref> Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, over 225,000 residents of Brandenburg commute to Berlin.

==Geography==
{{See also|Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|List of cities in Brandenburg by population}}

===Protected areas===
Brandenburg is known for its well-preserved natural environment and its ambitious natural protection policies which began in the 1990s. 15 large protected areas were designated following [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]].

==Politics ==
{{See also||List of rulers of Brandenburg}}
Politically, Brandenburg is a stronghold of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], which won the largest share of the vote and seats in every state election. All three [[List of Minister-Presidents of Brandenburg|Minister-Presidents of Brandenburg]] have come from the Social Democratic Party (unlike any other state except [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]) and they even won an absolute majority of seats and every single-member constituency in the [[1994 Brandenburg state election|1994 state election]].

On a federal level, the Social Democratic Party has also been the strongest party in most [[Elections in Germany#German elections since 1949|federal elections]], their strongholds being the [[Prignitz – Ostprignitz-Ruppin – Havelland I|northwestern part of the state]] and [[Potsdam – Potsdam-Mittelmark II – Teltow-Fläming II|Potsdam and its surrounding areas]]. However, the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] won the most votes in [[1990 German federal election|1990]], their [[2013 German federal election|2013 landslide]] and in [[2017 German federal election|2017]]. In [[2009 German federal election|2009]], [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] won the most votes in a year where, like in 2017, the Social Democratic collapsed. Prominent politicians from Brandenburg include Social Democrats [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]], who served in the [[Bundestag]] for Brandenburg before being elected [[President of Germany]], and likely [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Olaf Scholz]], who sits in the Bundestag for [[Potsdam – Potsdam-Mittelmark II – Teltow-Fläming II|Potsdam]].

Like in all other [[New states of Germany]], the populist parties [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] and, more recently, the [[Alternative for Germany]] are especially strong in Brandenburg.

Brandenburg has 4 out of 69 votes in the [[German Bundesrat|Bundesrat]] and, as of 2021, 25 seats out of 736 in the [[Bundestag]].

===Subdivisions===

Brandenburg is divided into 14 rural districts (''Landkreise'') and four urban districts (''kreisfreie Städte''), shown with their population in 2011:<ref>{{Cite web|title=Amt für Statistik Berlin Brandenburg – Statistiken|url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Statistiken/inhalt-statistiken.asp|access-date=24 April 2015|website=www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de|language=de|archive-date=8 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308125331/https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Statistiken/inhalt-statistiken.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref>
