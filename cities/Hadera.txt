The city is located along 7&nbsp;km (5&nbsp;mi) of the [[Israeli coastal plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]]. The city's population includes a high proportion of immigrants arriving since 1990, notably from [[Ethiopia]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Hadera}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

Hadera was established in 1891 as a farming colony by members of the Zionist group, [[Hovevei Zion]], from [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]]. By 1948, it was a regional center with a population of 11,800. In 1952, Hadera was declared a city, with jurisdiction over an area of 53,000 [[dunam]]s.<ref name="Haaretz"/>

Hadera was founded on 24 January 1891, in the early days of modern [[Zionism]] by [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] on land purchased by [[Yehoshua Hankin]], known as the Redeemer of the Valley.<ref name="Haaretz"/> The land was purchased from a Christian [[effendi]], Selim Khuri. This was the largest purchase of land in [[Eretz Israel]] by a Zionist group, although the land was of low quality and mostly swampland. The only inhabitants prior to the purchase were a few families raising [[water buffalo]]es and selling [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] reeds.<ref name="dispossession">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud1xBeZZRDsC&q=hadera&pg=PA94|title=The Claim of Dispossession: Jewish Land-Settlement and the Arabs, 1878-1948|page=93|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-964-0|year=1984|access-date=2008-10-25|last=Avneri|first= Aryeh L.}}</ref> The village was named after ''Wadi al-Khudeira''<ref>{{cite book|year=1959|author=Yehoshua Levinzon|title=HaSharon|publisher=Ma'arachot|place=Tel Aviv|url=https://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/hasharon/hasharon.01.pdf|quote=חדרה נקראה על שם הנחל הסמוך, אשר קטע ממנו נקרא בערבית ואדי חודֵירה - הנחל הירקרק.}}</ref> ({{langx|ar|وادي الخضيرة||the valley of verdure}}),<ref>{{cite book|year=1838|title=The Survey of Western Palestine: A General Index|volume=1|publisher=Committee of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]|place=London|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6A_AAAAYAAJ&q=%22w.+el+khudeirah%22}}</ref> as the nearby section of [[Hadera Stream]] was known.

In the end of the nineteenth century, the region of Hadera was populated by three immigrant groups – Circassians, Bosnians and Russian Jews. These transnational colonists joined what was, in Roy Marom's words, "a sparsely populated coastal plain inhabited by Arabic-speaking highland peasants and nomads of Turkmen, Nubian, Egyptian and of Arabian-Peninsular descent". Marom further notes that in 1871 Ottoman authorities inspected Khirbet al-Khudeira, and found it 'empty of inhabitants and lacking resident peasants who are eligible to purchase it in return for the payment of land registration fees". Selim al-Khoury, a Christian merchant from Haifa, purchased Kh. al-Khudeira, together with 3000 hectares of land, and established an agricultural estate among the ruins. In 1890, al-Khoury sold al-Khudeira to Yehoshua Hankin (1864–1945).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Marom |first=Roy |date=2023-03-09 |title=Hadera: transnational migrations from Eastern Europe to Ottoman Palestine and the glocal origins of the Zionist-Arab conflict |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00263206.2023.2183499 |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=250–270 |doi=10.1080/00263206.2023.2183499 |s2cid=257443159 |issn=0026-3206}}</ref>

After the [[1947–1949 Palestine war|1948 War]], the north-western part of  Hadera (including "Newe Chayyim") expanded on the land which had belonged to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|depopulated]] [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] village  of [[Arab al-Fuqara]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=W.|author-link=Walid Khalidi|title=All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_By7AAAAIAAJ |year=1992|location=[[Washington D.C.]]|publisher=[[Institute for Palestine Studies]]|isbn=978-0-88728-224-9 |page=144}}</ref>

Hot water gushing from the Hadera power plant draws schools of hundreds of [[sandbar shark|sandbar]] and [[dusky shark]] every winter. Scientists are researching the rare phenomenon, which is unknown in the vicinity. It is speculated that the water, which is ten degrees warmer than the rest of the sea, could be the attraction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/31/sharks-drawn-to-warm-waters-by-israeli-coastal-pow/|title=Sharks drawn to warm waters by Israeli coastal power plant|newspaper=The Washington Times}}</ref>

==Transportation==
Hadera lies along two main [[Israel Railways]] lines: the [[Coastal railway line, Israel|Coastal Line]] and the nowadays freight-only [[Eastern Railway (Israel)|Eastern Line]]. The city's [[Hadera West Railway Station|railway station]] is located in the west of the city and is on the Tel Aviv suburban line which runs between [[Binyamina]] and [[Ashkelon]]. The city center of Hadera is located near Israel's two main north–south highways; [[Highway 2 (Israel)|Highway 2]], linking Tel Aviv to Haifa, and [[Highway 4 (Israel)|Highway 4]].<ref name="Haaretz"/> This made Hadera an important junction for all coastal bus transportation after 1948 and into the 1950s.
