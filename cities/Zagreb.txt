==Name==
The etymology of the name ''Zagreb'' is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the [[Zagreb bishopric|Zagreb Diocese]] since the 12th century and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century.<ref>For instance, ''Zagrabia'' in [[Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi]]'s ''Mercurio Geografico'' (''Dalmatia Istria Bosnia Servia Croatia parte di Schiavonia [...]'', Rome, c. 1692; [http://www.swaen.com/item.php?id=13422 swaen.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729095621/http://www.swaen.com/item.php?id=13422 |date=29 July 2017 }}).</ref>
The name is first recorded in a charter by [[Felician, Archbishop of Esztergom]], dated 1134, mentioned as {{lang|la|Zagrabiensem episcopatum}}.<ref>Cod. Dipl. II 42: ''rex diuina gratia inspirante ... Zagrabiensem constituit episcopatum videlicet ut quos error idolatrie a dei cultura extraneos fecerat, episcopalis cuira ad viam veritatis reduceret.''

The name is probably derived from Proto-Slavic word [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/grębъ|*''grębъ'']] which means "hill" or "uplift". An Old Croatian reconstructed name [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/Zagrębъ|*''Zagrębъ'']] is manifested through the city's former German name, Agram.<ref name="Gluhak 1999">{{cite journal |title=Neke praslavenske riječi u hrvatskome |via=[[Hrčak]] |journal=Hrvatski dijalektološki zbornik |date=14 November 1999 |issue=11 |pages=11–20 |url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/168641 |access-date=10 July 2017 |last1=Gluhak |first1=Alemko |archive-date=13 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013065547/http://hrcak.srce.hr/168641 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some linguists (''e.g.'' [[Nada Klaić]], [[Miroslav Kravar]]) propose a [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] of *''Zabreg'', which would originate from Old Slavic ''breg'' (see Proto-Slavic [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/bergъ|*''bergъ'']]) in the sense of "riverbank", referring to River Sava. This metathesis has been attested in [[Kajkavian]],<ref name="Gračanin 2012">{{cite book |last1=Gračanin |first1=Hrvoje |editor1-last=Goldstein |editor1-first=Slavko |editor1-link=Ivo Goldstein |title=Povijest Grada Zagreba |trans-title=History of the City of Zagreb |volume=1 |date=2012 |publisher=Novi Liber |isbn=9789536045815 |page=22 |language=hr |chapter=Zagrebačko područje do osnutka Biskupije |trans-chapter=Zagreb area before the founding of Zagreb Diocese}}</ref> but the meaning of "riverbank" is lost in modern Croatian and [[folk etymology]] associates it instead with ''breg'' "hill", ostensibly referring to Medvednica.

In [[Middle Latin]] and [[Neo-Latin|Modern Latin]], Zagreb is known as ''Agranum'' (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in [[Strabo]]),{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} ''Zagrabia'' or ''Mons Graecensis'' (also ''Mons Crecensis'', in reference to [[Gradec, Zagreb|Grič (Gradec)]]).

The most common folk etymology derives the name of the city has been from the verb stem ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/za|za]]-[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/grobъ|grab-]]'', meaning "to scoop" or "to dig". A folk legend illustrating this derivation, attested but discarded as a serious etymology by [[Ivan Tkalčić]],
ties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which [[Augustin Kažotić]] (c. 1260–1323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.<ref>Nikola Štambak, ''Zagreb'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QM-ldXH50iAC&pg=PA77 p. 77] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405183509/https://books.google.com/books?id=QM-ldXH50iAC&pg=PA77 |date=5 April 2023 }}.</ref>

The first recorded appearance of the name "Zagreb" dates from 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centers: the smaller, eastern [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]], inhabited mainly by [[clergy]] and housing [[Zagreb Cathedral]], and the larger, western [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]], inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants.

===Early Zagreb===
The history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|King Ladislaus]], returning from his campaign against the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]], the canonical settlement [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]] developed north of [[Zagreb Cathedral]], as did the fortified settlement [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] on the neighbouring hill, with the border between the two formed by the Medveščak stream.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Hawkesworth |first= Celia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBSxMUKFJDEC&q=border+between+the+two+being+the+Medve%C5%A1%C4%8Dak+stream&pg=PA18 |title= Zagreb: A Cultural and Literary History |date= 2007 |publisher= Signal Books |isbn= 978-1-904955-30-6 |language= en |access-date= 3 October 2020 |archive-date= 10 April 2023 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230410060325/https://books.google.com/books?id=eBSxMUKFJDEC&q=border+between+the+two+being+the+Medve%C5%A1%C4%8Dak+stream&pg=PA18 |url-status=live }}</ref> Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town ([[Gornji Grad – Medveščak|Gornji Grad]]) and is one of the best-preserved urban nuclei in Croatia.

=== The relationship between Kaptol and Gradec throughout history ===
The development of Kaptol began in 1094 after the foundation of the [[diocese]], while the growth of Gradec began after the [[Golden Bull of 1242|Golden Bull]] was issued in 1242. In the history of the city of Zagreb, there have been numerous conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, mainly due to disputed issues of rent collection and due to disputed properties.

The first known conflicts took place in the middle of the 13th century and continued with interruptions until 1667. Because of the conflict, it was recorded that the Bishop of Kaptol excommunicated the residents of Gradec twice.

In the conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, there were several massacres of the citizens, destruction of houses and looting of citizens. In 1850, Gradec and Kaptol, with surrounding settlements, were united into a single settlement, today's city of Zagreb.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-11-18 |title=Na Badnjak, Kaptol je počeo bombardirati Gradec koji je uzvratio opsadom…Zaboravljeni opisi otkrivaju kako je izgledao rat Gradeca i Kaptola |url=https://blagamisterije.com/na-badnjak-kaptol-je-poceo-bombardirati-gradec-koji-je-uzvratio-opsadom-zaboravljeni-opisi-otkrivaju-kako-je-izgledao-rat-gradeca-i-kaptola/17902/ |access-date=2023-12-24 |website=Blaga & misterije |language=hr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lumen |date=2023-05-16 |title=Od veterničkog neandertalca do potresa 1699. |url=https://zagrebmojgrad.hr/od-veternickog-neandertalca-do-potresa-1699/ |access-date=2023-12-24 |website=Zagreb moj grad |language=hr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Željko |date=2023-01-05 |title=Krvavi most |url=https://hrvatski-vojnik.hr/krvavi-most/ |access-date=2023-12-24 |website=Hrvatski vojnik |language=hr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Džalo |first=Marijana |date=2021-08-02 |title=Krvavi most: Deset (ne)poznatih tajni mračne zagrebačke ulice |url=https://belizagrebgrad.com.hr/krvavi-most-deset-nepoznatih-tajni-mracne-zagrebacke-ulice/ |access-date=2023-12-24 |website=Beli Zagreb Grad |language=hr |archive-date=24 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224172423/https://belizagrebgrad.com.hr/krvavi-most-deset-nepoznatih-tajni-mracne-zagrebacke-ulice/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-07-19 |title=Gdje je sve počelo?

There were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they were not known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political center, and the regional Sabor ({{langx |la| Congregatio Regnorum Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae}}) representing Croatia, [[Slavonia]] and [[Dalmatia]], first convened at Gradec. Zagreb became the Croatian capital in 1557, with city also being chosen as the seat of the [[Ban of Croatia]] in 1621 under ban [[Nikola IX Frankopan]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.visit-croatia.co.uk/croatia-destinations/zagreb/history-zagreb/#:~:text=The%20name%20Zagreb%20first%20emerged,seat%20of%20the%20Croatian%20viceroys. |title= History of Zagreb |access-date= 20 March 2021 |archive-date= 23 April 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210423044352/https://www.visit-croatia.co.uk/croatia-destinations/zagreb/history-zagreb/#:~:text=The%20name%20Zagreb%20first%20emerged,seat%20of%20the%20Croatian%20viceroys. |url-status= live  | quote = [...] in 1621 the city was picked to become the seat of the Croatian viceroys.}}</ref>

In the 19th century, Zagreb was the center of the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]] and saw the foundation of important cultural and historic institutions.
In 1850, the town was united under its first [[List of mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] – [[Janko Kamauf]].<ref name="HRT" />

The first railway line to connect Zagreb with [[Zidani Most]] and [[Sisak]] opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a [[gasworks]]. The Zagreb [[water supply|waterworks]] opened in 1878.

After the [[1880 Zagreb earthquake]],<ref>{{Citation |title=Zagreb (Agram) Earthquake, Croatia, 1880 |date=2010 |work=The Illustrated History of Natural Disasters |pages=151–153 |editor-last=Kozák |editor-first=Jan |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-3325-3_33 |access-date=2024-10-15 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3325-3_33 |isbn=978-90-481-3325-3 |editor2-last=Čermák |editor2-first=Vladimír}}</ref> up to the 1914 outbreak of [[World War I]], development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today.
The first horse-drawn [[tram]] dated from 1891. The construction of railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into [[Donji grad (Zagreb)|Donji Grad]], characterized by a regular block pattern that prevails in [[Central Europe]]an cities. This bustling core includes many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres, and cinemas. An [[power station|electric-power plant]] was built in 1907.

Since 1 January 1877, the [[Grič cannon]] fires daily from the [[Lotrščak Tower]] on [[Grič, Zagreb|Grič]] to mark midday.

The first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighborhoods like [[Stara Peščenica]] in the east and [[Črnomerec]] in the west grew up. The Rokov perivoj neighbourhood, noted for its [[Art Nouveau]] features, was established at the start of the century.<ref>[[Paris Aéroport]], ''Paris Vous Aime Magazine'', No 13, avril-may-juin 2023, p. 139</ref>

After the war, [[working class|working-class]] districts such as [[Trnje, Zagreb|Trnje]] emerged between the railway and the [[Sava]], whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of [[Medvednica]] was completed [[Interwar period|between the two World Wars]].

In the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent – the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the [[Zagreb Fair]] opened.<ref name="HRT" />

During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (1941–1945), which was backed by [[Nazi Germany]] and by the [[Fascism in Italy|Italians]]. The history of [[Zagreb in World War II]] became rife with incidents of régime terror and resistance sabotage - the [[Ustaša]] régime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] took the city at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb functioned as the capital of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], one of the six constituent socialist republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

===Contemporary era===
The area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction-boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in [[Novi Zagreb]] (Croatian for ''New Zagreb''), originally called "Južni Zagreb" (''Southern Zagreb'').<ref name="juzni_zagreb">{{cite journal |url= http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |title= O imaginarnim kartama Južnog ≈ Novog Zagreba |journal= Zarez |last= Maretić |first= Mirko |issue= 222 |date= 10 January 2008 |access-date= 25 February 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090515163924/http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |archive-date= 15 May 2009 |language= hr}}</ref>
From 1999 Novi Zagreb has comprised two [[city districts]]: [[Novi Zagreb – zapad]] (''New Zagreb – West'') and [[Novi Zagreb – istok]] (''New Zagreb – East'')

The city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating [[Dubrava, Zagreb|Dubrava]], Podsused, [[Jarun]], [[Blato, Zagreb|Blato]], and other settlements.

The cargo railway hub and the [[international airport]] ([[Zagreb Airport|Pleso]]) were built south of the Sava river. The largest [[industrial district|industrial zone]] (Žitnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city, represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb hosted the [[1987 Summer Universiade|Summer Universiade]] in 1987.<ref name="HRT" /> This event initiated the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre and extensive new sport infrastructure, lacking until then, all around the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

During the 1991–1995 [[Croatian War of Independence]], the city saw some [[Battle of the Barracks|sporadic fighting]] around its [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] [[barracks|army barracks]], but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb [[rocket artillery]] in two [[Zagreb rocket attacks|rocket attacks]] which killed seven civilians and wounded many.

An urbanized area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of [[Zaprešić]], [[Samobor]], [[Dugo Selo]], and [[Velika Gorica]]. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.<ref>{{Croatian Census 2001|C|22}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
The climate of Zagreb is classified as an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Humid temperate climate|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), bordering a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'').

[[File:Zagreb city from Lotrščak Tower - Zagreb (42532052864).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zagreb's downtown]] Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it often becomes very warm or even hot with occasional afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above {{cvt|30|C}} on average 14.6 days each summer. During summertime, rainfall is abundant and it mainly falls during thunderstorms. With 840&nbsp;mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's ninth wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] but more than [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] or [[London]]. Compared to these cities, however, Zagreb has fewer rainy days, but the annual rainfall is higher due to heavier showers occurring mainly in late spring and summer. Autumn in its early stage often brings pleasant and sunny weather with occasional episodes of rain later in the season. Late autumn is characterized by a mild increase in the number of rainy days and a gradual decrease in daily temperature averages. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the [[Medvednica]] mountain as well as south-central districts along the [[Sava]] river being more prone to longer fog accumulation.
Winters are relatively cold, bringing overcast skies and a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39&nbsp;mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with the first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of days with snowfall in wintertime has decreased considerably. Spring is characterized by often pleasant but changeable weather. As the season progresses, sunny days become more frequent, bringing higher temperatures. Sometimes cold spells can occur as well, mostly in the season's early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around {{cvt|1|°C}} (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is {{cvt|20|C|1}}.<ref name="normals">{{cite web |url=http://klima.hr/k1/k1_2/zagreb_maksimir.pdf |title=Zagreb Climate Normals |access-date=2 December 2015 |publisher=Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service |archive-date=8 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208142149/http://klima.hr/k1/k1_2/zagreb_maksimir.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The most important historical [[high-rise]] constructions are [[Neboder]] (1958) on [[Ban Jelačić Square]], [[Cibona Tower]] (1987), and [[Zagrepčanka]] (1976) on Savska Street, [[Mamutica]] in Travno ([[Novi Zagreb – istok]] district, built in 1974) and [[Zagreb TV Tower]] on [[Medvednica|Sljeme]] (built in 1973).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://putujte.blogspot.com/2014/12/gdje-se-nalazi-najvazniji-neboder-u.html |title=Zagreb hoteli – putovanje u Zagreb |access-date=27 August 2015 |date=19 December 2014 |work=Blogger |language=hr |archive-date=14 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114064829/http://putujte.blogspot.com/2014/12/gdje-se-nalazi-najvazniji-neboder-u.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, [[Eurotower (Zagreb)|Eurotower]], [[HOTO Tower]], [[Zagrebtower]], [[Sky Office Tower]] and the [[tallest buildings in Croatia|tallest high-rise building]] in Zagreb [[Strojarska Business Center]].<ref name="skyoffice">{{cite web |url=http://www.skyoffice.hr/hrv/ |title=Sky Office – Zagreb |access-date=27 August 2015 |work=Sky Office |language=hr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817011757/https://www.skyoffice.hr/hrv/ |archive-date=17 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="empoirs">{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/buildings/1199128/sky-office-tower-zagreb-croatia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924143210/http://www.emporis.com/buildings/1199128/sky-office-tower-zagreb-croatia |url-status=usurped |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Sky Office Tower, Zagreb |access-date=27 August 2015 |work=Empoirs}}</ref>

In [[Novi Zagreb]], the neighbourhoods of [[Blato, Zagreb|Blato]] and [[Lanište, Croatia|Lanište]] expanded significantly, including the [[Arena Zagreb|Zagreb Arena]] and the adjoining business centre.<ref name="blato_lanište">{{cite web |url=http://www.novi-zagreb.hr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1174 |title=Blato i Lanište postaju najsuvremeniji dio Zagreba? |work=novi-zagreb.hr |date=28 March 2008 |access-date=27 July 2008 |language=hr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721101337/http://www.novi-zagreb.hr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1174 |archive-date=21 July 2011}}</ref>

Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4–8 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lanište or Kajzerica.<ref name="javno">{{cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/hr/zagreb/clanak.php?id=55540 |title=Na Laništu gradnja iznad 9 katova |access-date=21 September 2009 |date=21 June 2007 |work=Javno.hr |language=hr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115193913/http://www.javno.com/hr/zagreb/clanak.php?id=55540 |archive-date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Stari grad Medvedgrad - Zagreb 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|[[Medvedgrad]] fortress]]
The wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the [[Veternica cave]] from the [[Paleolithic]] and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of Šćitarjevo.

Picturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, Šestine, Gračani, and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, Šestine umbrellas, and [[gingerbread]] products.

To the north is the [[Medvednica]] Mountain ({{langx|hr|Zagrebačka gora}}), with its highest peak [[Medvednica|Sljeme]](1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, [[Zagreb TV Tower]] is located. The Sava and the [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|World Ski Championship tournament]].
[[File:Sljeme_(31374028193).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zagreb TV Tower]]]]

From the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as [[Velebit]] Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering [[Julian Alps]] in neighboring [[Slovenia]]. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts, and a chairlift.

The old [[Medvedgrad]], a recently restored medieval [[wikt:Special:Search/burg|burg]] was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the ''Shrine of the Homeland'', a memorial with an [[eternal flame]], where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for [[homeland]] in its history, customarily on [[Public holiday|national holiday]]s. The ruined medieval fortress [[Susedgrad]] is located on the far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.

Zagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of [[Žumberak]]-[[Medvednica]] fault zone.<ref>[http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf SEISMOGENIC ZONES OF NORTHWESTERN CROATIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206110700/http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf |date=6 February 2016 }} GNGTS 2008</ref> It's classified as an area of high seismic activity.<ref name="embassy earthquake">{{cite web |url=http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html |title=Earthquake – Zagreb, Croatia – Embassy of the United States |work=usembassy.gov |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206090402/http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html |archive-date=6 February 2016}}</ref> The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the [[1880 Zagreb earthquake]] (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area.<ref name="landslide survey croatian">{{cite web |url=http://www.hgi-cgs.hr/zagreb_potresi.html |title=Potresi na zagrebačkom području |last=dpuljic |work=hgi-cgs.hr |access-date=5 February 2016 |archive-date=6 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206080543/http://www.hgi-cgs.hr/zagreb_potresi.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes.<ref name="landslide survey croatian" /> Croatian Chief of [[Office of Emergency Management]] Pavle Kalinić stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible.

The city administration bodies are the '''[[Zagreb Assembly|Zagreb City Assembly]]''' (''Gradska skupština Grada Zagreba'') as the representative body and the '''[[list of mayors of Zagreb|mayor of Zagreb]]''' (''Gradonačelnik Grada Zagreba'') who is the executive head of the city.

The City Assembly is the representative body of the citizens of the City of Zagreb elected for a four-year term on the basis of [[universal suffrage]] in [[direct elections]] by [[secret ballot]] using [[proportional representation|proportional system]] with [[d'Hondt method]] in a manner specified by law. There are 51 representatives in the City Assembly, among them the president and vice-presidents of the assembly are elected by the representatives.

Before 2009, the mayor was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct elections by [[Majority vote|majoritarian vote]] ([[two-round system]]) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her).

The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to the law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb or not less than two-thirds of the [[Zagreb Assembly]] city deputies have the right to initiate a [[recall referendum|city referendum]] regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favor of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one-third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. {{frac|1|3}} of persons in the City of Zagreb [[electoral register]], the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and [[special elections|special mayoral by-elections]] shall be held).

In the City of Zagreb, the [[mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a "city with county rights", there isn't a State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government).
City administration offices, institutions and services (18 [[Municipal service|city offices]], 1 [[Municipal service|public institute]] or [[Municipal service|bureau]] and 2 [[Municipal services|city services]]) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration.
The city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly).

Local government is organised in 17 [[Districts of Zagreb|city district]]s represented by City District Councils. Residents of districts elect members of councils.<ref>[http://www.zagreb.hr/default.aspx?id=1125 "zagreb.hr – Zagreb in brief (City administration)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909131055/http://www.zagreb.hr/default.aspx?id=1125 |date=9 September 2008 }}.

<!-- Currently in dispute: A highway tunnel going through the [[Medvednica]] Mountains is in the planning stages and could become Zagreb's main northern transit connection. This project has generated controversy among locals who oppose it. A northern branch of the [[Zagreb bypass]] (''Sjeverna tangenta'') going through the Medvednica Mountains in the northern parts of Zagreb is in planning stages.

The city has an extensive [[Boulevard|avenue]] network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and [[Zagreb bypass]], a congested four-lane [[highway]] encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tuškanac, Kvaternik Square, Klaić Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east–west arteries, former [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway|Highway "Brotherhood and Unity"]], consisting of [[Ljubljanska Avenue]], [[Zagrebačka Avenue]] and [[Slavonska Avenue]]; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city center.

There are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near [[Mičevec]], as well as two bridges that are part of the [[Zagreb bypass]], one near [[Zaprešić]] (west), and the other near [[Ivanja Reka]] (east).

Two additional bridges across the river [[Sava]] are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.

--><!-- NEXT PARAGRAPH COMMENTED OUT BECAUSE THESE ARE NO REAL PROJECTS AT THIS MOMENT

====Tunnels====
A recent traffic study of Zagreb's city center proposes building seven tunnels underneath the city center.{{cn}} The number of cars in the city center is rising by 4% every year and current traffic levels require a widening of the road infrastructure. A particular problem is [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]] Street, which has high amounts of both cars, tram, and pedestrian traffic. Any widening of this street would take some space from the pedestrians. The tunnels would triple the downtown road capacity and allow the cars to travel at {{cvt|50|km/h}} at [[peak hour]]. The seven tunnels would also help solve the problem of the unfinished [[Sljeme tunnel]], which has been a citywide nuisance for a long time.

The proposed tunnels would have an underground interchange near Jabukovac street in the hills north of the city center. Three tunnels (one of which would have two tubes) would connect the future Jabukovac interchange with the city center. Another tunnel would connect Jabukovac to [[Gupčeva zvijezda]], one would go to Zelengaj north of Britanski square and the third one would go to Vončinina Street, about {{cvt|1|km|mi}} east of Jabukovac. There would also be a tunnel connecting Draškovićeva Street to [[Ribnjak, Zagreb]], eliminating the long and often congested bypass which uses smaller streets near [[Žrtava Fašizma Square]].

Should the proposal be accepted, it would take three years to build the tunnels.<ref name=tuneli>{{cite web |url=http://www.sutra.hr/gradski-ritam/tunelima-kroz-centar-zagreba |title=Tunelima kroz centar Zagreba |access-date=27 November 2007 |last=Šimunović |first=Damjan |date=24 November 2007 |work=Sutra.hr |language=hr}}</ref>

===Public transportation===
[[File:19-06-16-Zagreb-DJI 0183.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Zagreb Glavni kolodvor|Main Railway Station]]]]
[[Public transport]]ation in the city is organized in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by [[tram]]s, the outer city areas, and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit [[Zagreb Commuter Rail|commuter rail]].

The public transportation company [[Zagrebački električni tramvaj|ZET]] (''Zagrebački električni tramvaj'', Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidized by the city council.

The national rail operator [[Croatian Railways]] (''Hrvatske željeznice'', HŽ) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area and is a [[government-owned corporation]].

The [[funicular]] (''uspinjača'') in the historic part of the city is a [[tourist attraction]].

[[Taxicab|Taxi]] market has been liberalized in early 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-butkovic-novim-zakonom-o-prijevozu-u-cestovnom-prometu-jeftiniji-i-dostupniji-taksi-za-sve-gradjane/23630 |title=Ministar Butković: Novim Zakonom o prijevozu u cestovnom prometu jeftiniji i dostupniji taksi za sve građane |publisher=Government of the Republic of Croatia |access-date=20 November 2018 |archive-date=20 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120140126/https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-butkovic-novim-zakonom-o-prijevozu-u-cestovnom-prometu-jeftiniji-i-dostupniji-taksi-za-sve-gradjane/23630 |url-status=live }}</ref> and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.

Zagreb has an extensive [[tram]] network with 15 day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of {{cvt|30|-|50|km/h|0|abbr=off}}, but slow considerably during [[rush hour]]. On narrower streets the tracks are either shared with car traffic or separated by a painted yellow line, which can still be used by taxis, buses and emergency vehicles, whereas on larger avenues the tracks are situated inside [[Reserved track|green belts]].

<!-- NEXT PARAGRAPH COMMENTED OUT BECAUSE THESE ARE NO REAL PROJECTS AT THIS MOMENT
Trams connect almost all parts of the city, and a number of new lines have been recently proposed, including to "[[Arena Zagreb|Arena]]", handball stadium in construction, to Vrapce, and [[Zagreb Airport]], the main airport in Zagreb located in the suburb of [[Pleso]]. -->
An ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies [[KONČAR Group|Končar elektroindustrija]] and, to a lesser extent, by [[TŽV Gredelj]], has recently been finished. The new "[[CROTRAM|TMK 2200]]", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.<ref name=new_series>{{cite web |url=http://www.zet.hr/vijesti/novosti/predstavljen-71-niskopodni-tramvaj.aspx |title=Predstavljen 71. niskopodni tramvaj |access-date=8 January 2008 |date=27 December 2007 |publisher=[[Zagrebački električni tramvaj]] (ZET) |language=hr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231084927/http://www.zet.hr/vijesti/novosti/predstavljen-71-niskopodni-tramvaj.aspx |archive-date=31 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Suburban rail network====
{{main|Zagreb Commuter Rail}}

The commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east–west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.<ref name=suburban_rail>{{cite web |url=http://www.24sata.hr/index.php?cmd=show_clanak&tekst_id=73771 |title=Zagreb kupuje 18 vlakova za brži prigradski promet |date=1 August 2008 |last=Vojković |first=Ana Marija |access-date=8 December 2008 |language=hr |work=[[24 sata (Croatia)|24 sata]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005631/http://www.24sata.hr/index.php?cmd=show_clanak&tekst_id=73771 |archive-date=28 September 2011}}</ref>

A new link to the nearby town of [[Samobor]] has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be [[standard gauge|standard-gauge]] and tie in with normal [[Croatian Railways]] operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called ''[[Samoborček]]'' was closed in the 1970s.<ref name="samoborček">{{cite journal |url=http://193.198.60.202/komunalni/arhiva/362/str11.pdf |title=Uskoro Samoborček i novi prigradski vlakovi |language=hr |date=28 November 2007 |access-date=31 July 2008 |journal=Zagrebački Komunalni Vjesnik |issue=362 |page=11 |issn=1845-4968 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910055608/http://193.198.60.202/komunalni/arhiva/362/str11.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2008}}</ref>

===Air traffic===
{{main|Zagreb Airport}}

[[Zagreb Airport]] {{airport codes|ZAG|LDZA}} is the main Croatian international airport, a {{cvt|17|km|mi}} drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of [[Velika Gorica]]. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]].<ref name=zageb_pleso>{{cite web |url=http://www.zagreb-life.com/travel/travel.php |title=Franjo Tuđman Airport terminal |access-date=2 July 2006 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131750/http://www.zagreb-life.com/travel/travel.php |url-status=dead}}</ref> The airport had 3.45&nbsp;million passengers in 2019 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5.5&nbsp;million passengers.

Zagreb also has a second, smaller airport, [[Lučko]] {{airport codes|2=LDZL}}. It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lučko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zagreb-airport.hr/hr/poslovne_1_3/index.aspx |title=Zagreb Airport – History |access-date=2 October 2008 |language=hr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801145700/http://www.zagreb-airport.hr/hr/poslovne_1_3/index.aspx |archive-date=1 August 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
