== Name ==
{{anchor|Name}}
The name of Basel is first recorded as ''Basilia'' in the 3rd century (237/8), at the time referring to the [[Basel oppidum|Roman castle]]. This name is mostly interpreted as deriving from the personal name ''Basilius'', from a toponym ''villa Basilia'' ("[[Roman villa|estate]] of Basilius") or similar.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benpenhill |title=Why is Basel called Basel? |url=https://profound-advice.com/why-is-basel-called-basel/ |website=Profound-Advice |access-date=17 June 2023 |archive-date=17 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230617062657/https://profound-advice.com/why-is-basel-called-basel/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another suggestion derives it from a name ''Basilia'' attested in northern France as a development of ''basilica'', the term for a public or church building (as in [[Bazeilles]]), but all of these names reference early church buildings of the 4th or 5th century and cannot be adduced for the 3rd-century attestation of ''Basilia''.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://search.ortsnamen.ch/de/|title= Basel|website= ortsnamen.ch|access-date= 10 February 2020|quote= einem nordgalloromanischen Ortsnamentypus *basilia (Fellmann 1981: 48s) gestellt.|archive-date= 17 December 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191217075845/https://search.ortsnamen.ch/de/|url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="Kristol">''Basileam applicuerunt'' (AD 237 or 238).

By popular etymology, or simple assonance, the [[basilisk]] becomes closely associated with the  city, used as [[heraldic supporter]] from 1448, represented on coins minted by the city, and frequently found in ornaments.

The [[Middle French]] form {{lang|frm|Basle}} was adopted into English, but this form has fallen gradually out of use although it continues to be used in some sections of [[British English]] including the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite web |title=How to say Basel/Bâle/Basle/Basilea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2011/09/how_to_say_baselbalebaslebasil.shtml |website=BBC News |access-date=29 May 2022 |archive-date=29 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220529143820/https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2011/09/how_to_say_baselbalebaslebasil.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Basle air crash: Memorial service marks 40th anniversary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-22094227 |access-date=29 May 2022 |work=BBC News}}</ref>{{update after|2024|7|19}} Currently, the spelling ''Basel'' is most often used, to match the official German spelling. In French {{lang|fr|Basle}} was still in use in the 18th century, but was gradually replaced by the modern French spelling {{lang|fr|Basle}}. In Icelandic, the city is recorded as {{lang|is|Buslaraborg}} in the 12th-century itinerary ''[[Leiðarvísir og borgarskipan]]''.

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

=== Early history ===
[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]] in Augusta Raurica, one of the most important Roman archaeological sites in Switzerland]]
There are traces of a settlement at the nearby [[Rhine knee]] from the early [[La Tène period]] (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the [[Raurici]] at the site of ''Basel-Gasfabrik'' (to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of ''Arialbinnum'' that was mentioned on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'').<ref>René Teuteberg: ''Basler Geschichte'', p. 49.</ref> The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an ''[[Basel oppidum|oppidum]]'' on the site of [[Basel Minster]], probably in reaction to the [[Gallic War|Roman invasion of Gaul]].

In [[Roman Gaul]], [[Augusta Raurica]] was established some {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a ''[[castra|castrum]]'' (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic ''oppidum''. In AD 83, the area  was incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Superior]]. The Roman Senator [[Lucius Munatius Plancus|Munatius Plancus]] is known as the traditional founder of Basel since the Renaissance.<ref name="Werthmüller-2013">{{Cite book |last=Werthmüller |first=Hans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18OeBgAAQBAJ |title=Tausend Jahre Literatur in Basel |date=2013-12-11 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-3-0348-6561-6 |pages=31 |language=de}}</ref> Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the ''[[Provincia Maxima Sequanorum]]'' formed by [[Diocletian]]. ''[[Basel oppidum|Basilia]]'' is first named by the [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] in his Res Gestae<ref name="Werthmüller-2013" /> as part of the Roman military fortifications along the Rhine in the late 4th century.

The Germanic confederation of the [[Alemanni]] attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the [[Battle of Solicinium]] (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]].

The [[Duchy of Alemannia]] fell under [[Francia|Frankish]] rule in the 6th century. The Alemannic and [[Franks|Frankish]] settlement of Basel gradually grew around the old Roman castle in the 6th and 7th century. It appears that Basel surpassed the ancient regional capital of [[Augusta Raurica]] by the 7th century;  based on the evidence of a gold ''[[tremissis]]'' (a small gold coin with the value of a third of a ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'') with the inscription ''Basilia fit'', Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmb.ch/en/collection/object/basel-kopie-vom-gold-triens-des-muenzmeisters-gunso-anfangs-7-jh-vs.html |title=Basel.

Basel at this time was part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Besançon|Archdiocese of Besançon]]. A separate [[bishopric of Basel]], replacing the ancient bishopric of [[Augusta Raurica]], was established in the 8th century. Under bishop [[Haito]] (r. 806–823), the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle<ref>{{Cite web |title=Views of pre-medieval Basel |url=https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/Uni-Nova/Uni-Nova-124/Uni-Nova-124-Views-of-pre-medieval-Basel.html |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=www.unibas.ch |language=en |archive-date=17 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220517140933/https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/Uni-Nova/Uni-Nova-124/Uni-Nova-124-Views-of-pre-medieval-Basel.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> (replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019).

At the partition of the [[Carolingian Empire]] through the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, Basel was first given to [[West Francia]] and became its German exclave.<ref name="Werthmüller-2013" /> It passed to [[East Francia]] with the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] of 870. Basel was  destroyed by the [[Magyar invasion|Magyars]] in 917.<ref name="Werthmüller-2013" /> The rebuilt town became part of [[Upper Burgundy]], and as such was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1032.

{{main|Prince-Bishopric of Basel }}
[[File:Basler - Basler Münster Westfassade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Basel Minster]], built between 1019 and 1500]]

From the donation by [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]]{{sfnb|Wood|2006|pp=285–286, 313}} of the [[Moutier-Grandval Abbey]] and all its possessions to Bishop [[Adalbero II of Metz]] in 999 until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Basel was ruled by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|Prince-Bishop]]s.<ref>''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1993, p.659</ref>

In 1019, the construction of the [[Basel Minster|cathedral of Basel]] (known locally as the ''Münster'') began under [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>Franz Kugler, ''[[Kleine Schriften]] und Studien zur Kunstgeschichte'', 1853, p. 486</ref>

In the 11th to 12th century, Basel gradually acquired the characteristics of a medieval [[city]].
The main market place is first mentioned in 1091. The first city walls were constructed around 1100 (with improvements made in the mid-13th and in the late 14th century). A city council of nobles and burghers is recorded for 1185, and the first [[mayor]], Heinrich Steinlin of Murbach,  for 1253. The first bridge across the Rhine was built in 1225 under bishop [[Heinrich von Thun]] (at the location of the modern [[Middle Bridge, Basel|Middle Bridge]]), and from this time the settlement of ''Kleinbasel'' gradually formed around the bridgehead on the far river bank. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier.<ref name="habicht">Habicht, Peter, ''Basel – A Center at the Fringe'' (Basel: Christoph Merian Verlag, 2006) pp. 43, 55, 70, 79.</ref> For many centuries{{dubious|date=July 2020}} to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river "between [[Lake Constance]] and the sea". The first city [[guild]] were the   [[furriers]], established in 1226. A total of about fifteen guilds were established in the course of the 13th century, reflecting the increasing economic prosperity of the city.<ref name="habicht"/> The [[Crusade of 1267]] set out from Basel.

Political conflicts between the bishops and the burghers began in the mid-13th century and continued throughout the 14th century. By the late 14th century, the city was for all practical purposes independent although it continued to nominally pledge fealty to the bishops. The [[House of Habsburg]] attempted to gain control over the city. This was not successful, but it caused a political split among the burghers of Basel into a pro-Habsburg faction, known as ''Sterner'', and an anti-Habsburg faction, the ''Psitticher''.
 
The [[Black Death]] reached Basel in 1348. The [[Persecution of Jews during the Black Death|Jews were blamed]], and an estimated 50 to 70 Jews were executed by burning on 16 January 1349 in what has become known as the [[Basel massacre]].<ref name="habicht"/> The [[1356 Basel earthquake|Basel earthquake of 1356]] destroyed much of the city along with a [[Rötteln Castle|number of castles]] in the vicinity.

{{anchor|Böse Fasnacht}} A riot on 26 February 1376, known as ''Böse Fasnacht'', led to the killing of a number of men of [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria]]. This was seen as a serious [[breach of the peace]], and the city council blamed "foreign ruffians" for this and executed twelve alleged perpetrators. Leopold nevertheless had the city placed under [[imperial ban]], and in a treaty of 9 July, Basel was given a heavy fine and was placed under Habsburg control. To free itself from Habsburg hegemony, Basel joined the [[Swabian League of Cities]] in 1385, and many knights of the pro-Habsburg faction, along with duke Leopold himself, were killed  in the [[Battle of Sempach]] the following year. A formal treaty with Habsburg was made in 1393.

Basel had gained its de facto independence from both the bishop and from the Habsburgs and was free to pursue its own policy of territorial expansion, beginning around 1400.

{{anchor|Baselstab}}{{anchor|coat of arms}}
The unique representation of a bishops' [[crozier]] as the heraldic charge in the [[coat of arms of Basel]] first appears in the form of a gilded wooden staff in the 12th century. It is of unknown origin or significance (beyond its obvious status of bishop's crozier), but it is assumed to have represented a relic, possibly attributed to [[Germanus of Granfelden|Saint Germanus of Granfelden]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.staatskanzlei.bs.ch/kommunikation/baselstab.html |title=staatskanzlei.bs.ch |access-date=23 July 2020 |archive-date=15 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715223344/https://www.staatskanzlei.bs.ch/kommunikation/baselstab.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> This staff (known as ''Baselstab'') became a symbol representing the Basel diocese, depicted in bishops' seals of the late medieval period. It is represented in a heraldic context in the early 14th century, not yet as a heraldic charge but as a kind of heraldic achievement flanked by the heraldic shields of the bishop. The staff is also represented in the bishops's seals of the period. The use of the ''Baselstab'' in black as the coat of arms of the city was introduced in 1385. From this time, the ''Baselstab'' in red represented the bishop, and the same charge in black represented the city.

In 1412 (or earlier), the well-known [[Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen]] was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century [[Council of Basel]] (1431–1449), including the 1439 election of [[antipope Felix V]]. In 1459, [[Pope Pius II]] endowed the [[University of Basel]], where such notables as [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Paracelsus]] later taught. At the same time the new craft of [[printing press|printing]] was [[Global spread of the printing press#Switzerland|introduced to Basel]] by apprentices of [[Johann Gutenberg]]. In 1461, the land around [[Farnsburg Castle|Farnsburg]] became a part of Basel.<ref name="Landolt-1998" />

The [[Schwabe publishing house]] was founded in 1488 by [[Johannes Petri (printer)|Johannes Petri]] and is the oldest publishing house still in business. [[Johann Froben]] also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus.<ref>Josef Nadler, ''Literaturgeschichte der deutschen Schweiz'', Grethlein 1932</ref> In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the [[Upper Rhenish Circle|Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle]]; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. In 1500 the construction of the [[Basel Münster]] was finished.

The city had remained neutral through the [[Swabian War]] of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The [[Treaty of Basel (1499)|Treaty of Basel]] ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland ''de facto'' from the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name="Rappard">Rappard, William, ''Collective Security in Swiss Experience 1291–1948'' (London, 1948) p. 85 ff</ref>

On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its [[Canton of Basel|eleventh canton]].<ref>Karl Strupp, ''Wörterbuch Des Völkerrechts'', De Gruyter 1960, p.225</ref> It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with [[Strasbourg]] and [[Mulhouse]], and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.<ref name=autogenerated1>Habicht, Peter, ''Basel – A Center at the Fringe'' (Basel 2006) p. 65 ff</ref><ref name="Bonjour">Bonjour, Edgar ''et al.'' ''A short History of Switzerland'' (Oxford, 1952) p. 139 ff</ref>

In 1503, the new bishop [[Christoph von Utenheim]] refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.<ref name="habicht"/>

In 1529, the city became Protestant under [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Oecolampadius]] and the bishop's seat was moved to [[Porrentruy]]. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the [[Daig (Switzerland)|"Daig"]] played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a ''de facto'' [[Aristocracy|city aristocracy]].

The first edition of ''Christianae religionis institutio'' (''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' – [[John Calvin]]'s great exposition of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.<ref>Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, Harold Fullard, Henry Clifford Darby, Charles Loch Mowat, ''[[The New Cambridge Modern History]]'', 1990, p. 113</ref>

In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist [[David Joris]].<ref name="habicht"/>

In 1543, ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by [[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564).<ref>''The Illustrations from the Works of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels'', Courier Dover Publications 1973, p.30</ref>

There are indications [[Joachim Meyer]], author of the influential 16th-century [[martial arts]] text ''Kunst des Fechten'' ("The Art of Fencing"), came from Basel. In 1661 the ''[[Amerbach Cabinet|Amerbaschsches Kabinett]],'' a vast collection of exotic artifacts, coins, medals and books was purchased by Basel.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Braungart |first=Wolfgang |date=1988 |title=Kunst-Besitzindividualismus : das Amerbachsche Kunstkabinett und die Entstehung der frühneuzeitlichen Kunstkammer |url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=kas-001:1988:39::568 |journal=Unsere Kunstdenkmäler: Mitteilungsblatt für die Mitglieder der Gesellschaft für Schweizerische Kunstgeschichte |issue=39 |pages=293–295, 298 |via=E-Periodica}}</ref> It was to become to the first public museum of art.<ref>Braungart, Wolfgang (1988). p.298</ref> Its collection became the core of the later [[Kunstmuseum Basel|Basel Museum of Art]].

The Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as [[Jakob Bernoulli]], [[Johann Bernoulli]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]], were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.

On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug [[LSD]] was first synthesized by Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] at [[Sandoz]] Laboratories in Basel.

In 1967, the population of [[1967 Basel Picasso paintings purchase referendum|Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso]] which were at risk of being sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. [[Pablo Picasso]] was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.srf.ch/kultur/kunst/legendaerer-volksentscheid-das-picasso-wunder-von-basel| title = Legendärer Volksentscheid – Das Picasso-Wunder von Basel – Kultur – SRF| date = 16 March 2013}}</ref>

The city's and canton's parliament, the [[Grand Council of Basel-Stadt]] ('''Grosser Rat'''), consists of 100 seats, with members (called in German: ''Grossrat/Grossrätin'') elected every 4 years. The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance.

=== Transport ===
Basel's airport, [[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg]], is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of [[continental Europe]] from [[North Sea|the North Sea]] by ship along the Rhine.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==== Port ====
[[File:Middle Bridge, Basel, Switzerland.JPG|thumb|The Rhine in Basel as Switzerland's gateway to the sea]]
Basel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the [[Rhine]] and connect to ocean-going ships at the [[port of Rotterdam]].

==== Air transport ====
[[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg]] is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could "emigrate" to the other side of the airport.

==== Railways ====
[[File:Basel, station Basel SBB foto1 2013-07-20 10.31.jpg|thumb|[[Basel SBB railway station|Basel Bahnhof SBB]], self-proclaimed "world's first international railway station"]]
Basel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations—those of the German, French and Swiss networks—lie within the city (although the Swiss ([[Basel SBB railway station|Basel SBB]]) and French ([[Basel SBB railway station|Bâle SNCF]]) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]] is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]]. The largest goods railway complex of the country<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basel.com/en/getting-there-exploring-the-city/Basel-s-railway-stations|title=Arrival by train|access-date=16 October 2020|archive-date=17 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017223940/https://www.basel.com/en/getting-there-exploring-the-city/Basel-s-railway-stations|url-status=live}}</ref> is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed [[Intercity Express|ICE]] railway line from [[Karlsruhe–Basel high-speed railway|Karlsruhe to Basel]] was completed in 2008 while phase I of the [[LGV Rhin-Rhône|TGV Rhin-Rhône]] line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.<ref>[http://www.infolignes.com/recherche.php?date_num_train=2012|05|14&type_heure=1&train_horaire_depart=14|00&next_horaire=14|00&num_train=9218 SNCF website, TGV Lyria 9218] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930202505/http://www.infolignes.com/recherche.php?date_num_train=2012%7C05%7C14&type_heure=1&train_horaire_depart=14%7C00&next_horaire=14%7C00&num_train=9218 |date=30 September 2014 }} accessed 14 May 2012</ref>

==== Roads ====
Basel is located on the [[A3 motorway (Switzerland)|A3 motorway]].

Within the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):

* Schwarzwaldbrücke (built 1972)
* Wettsteinbrücke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)
* Mittlere Rheinbrücke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine)
* Johanniterbrücke (built 1967)
* Dreirosenbrücke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)

==== Ferries ====
A somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of [[reaction ferry]] boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of {{convert|20|to|30|m|abbr=off}}. To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45° from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.

[[File:River ferry (Basel, Switzerland).jpg|thumb|Cable ferry across the Rhine in Basel]]

==== Public transport ====
[[File:Basel - Straßenbahnnetzplan.png|thumb|Basel tram network]]
Basel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large [[Basel Trams|tram network]]. Today, Basel has the largest tramway in terms of kilometers of rail tracks in Switzerland.<ref name="Appenzeller">Appenzeller, Stephan (1995).p.55</ref> Historically, only [[Geneva]] had a larger one at some point.<ref name="Appenzeller"/>

The green-colored local [[light rail|trams]] and buses are operated by the [[Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe]] (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the [[Baselland Transport]] (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and [[Baden]] region in Germany. The [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]], the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by [[Schweizerische Bundesbahnen|SBB]], [[SNCF]] and [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]].

==== Border crossings ====
Basel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany, and Switzerland; because it sits on the Swiss national border and is beyond the [[Jura Mountains]], many within the [[Swiss military]] reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime.<ref name="mcphee19831031">{{cite news | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I | magazine=The New Yorker | date=31 October 1983 | access-date=22 July 2013 | author=McPhee, John | pages=50 | archive-date=14 July 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230210/http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | url-status=live }}</ref> It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the [[Schengen Area]] on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the [[European Union Customs Union]] (though it did join the [[EU Single Market]]) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.

Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.

=== Health ===
[[File:Basel 2012-10-05 Batch (61).JPG|thumb|University Children's Hospital Basel]]
As the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the [[University Hospital of Basel|Universitätsspital Basel]] and the Universitätskinderspital Basel.  Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the [[Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute]] is located in Basel too.

=== Energy ===
Basel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a [[2000-watt society|2000 Watt society]], a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to [[Minergie]] or ''[[Passive house|Passivhaus]]'' standards, electricity generation from [[renewable energy]] sources,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/swissinfo.html?siteSect=105&sid=7407138|title=Geothermal project shakes Basel again|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=1 September 2015|archive-date=30 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530231218/http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/swissinfo.html?siteSect=105&sid=7407138|url-status=dead}}</ref> and vehicles using natural gas, [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] and [[biogas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.basel.ch/en/basel/urban_development/2000_watt_society|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111061314/http://www.basel.ch/en/basel/urban_development/2000_watt_society|url-status=dead|title=The Basel pilot region of the 2000 Watt Society|archivedate=11 January 2009}}</ref>
A building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.<ref>Carter, J.G. 2011, "Climate change adaptation in European cities", Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 193–198.</ref>

A [[Enhanced geothermal systems|hot dry rock geothermal energy]] project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused [[induced seismicity in Basel]].

:According to the BIS, "The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/about/origins.htm|title=Origins|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|access-date=23 May 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100609010907/http://www.bis.org/about/origins.htm| archive-date= 9 June 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Museums ===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of museums]] -->
[[File:Basel - 2017 - Kunstmuseum Basel - Altbau.jpg|thumb|The [[Kunstmuseum Basel]], oldest public museum of art in Europe]]
The [[Museums in Basel|Basel museums]] cover a broad and diverse spectrum of [[collection (museum)|collections]] with a marked concentration in the fine arts. They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.<ref name=Museums>{{cite web |url=http://www.bs.ch/en/Portrait/Kultur/Museen.html |title=A lot to see in such a small city |publisher=Canton of Basel-Stadt |type=official site |website=Kanton Basel-Stadt |access-date=31 August 2015 |archive-date=15 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015210545/http://www.bs.ch/en/Portrait/Kultur/Museen.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of [[avant-garde]] [[museum architecture]].

=== Events ===
The city of Basel is a centre for numerous fairs and events all year round. One of the most important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the [[Art Basel]] which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. [[Baselworld]], the watch and jewellery show (''Uhren- und Schmuckmesse'') one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer [[MCH Group]] has its head office in Basel.

[[File:Top Secret Drum Corps.jpg|thumb|Top Secret Drum Corps at the 2009 Basel Tattoo]]
The [[carnival]] of the city of Basel (''[[Carnival of Basel|Basler Fasnacht]]'') is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (''Morgestraich'') on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after [[Ash Wednesday]] and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.

[[Basel Tattoo]], founded in 2006 by the local [[Top Secret Drum Corps]], has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the [[Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo|Edinburgh Military Tattoo]].<ref name="swissinfo">[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Basels_tattoo_spins_to_success.html?cid=995834 Basel's tattoo spins to success]{{Dead link|date=February 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. swissinfo.ch, written 2008-7-15, retrieved 13 July 2012</ref> The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport|Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS)]], making it the official [[military tattoo]] of Switzerland.

The city will host the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2025]] at the St. Jakobshalle arena.[https://eurovision.tv/story/basel-will-host-eurovision-song-contest-2025?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZfEUAWmVmvPxRsaO4wjO6Cc3cE-k_HcKCvbjMXP1OzIVtqiXOGAAMLCt4_aem_m89G9CucLjoWT42R8-xOVQ]

=== Cuisine ===
There are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including ''[[Basler Läckerli]]'' cookies and ''[[Mässmogge]]'' candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.

=== Zoo ===

Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide [[Indian rhinoceros]] birth<ref name="Panzernashornhaus">[http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=37 {{in lang|de}} Eröffnung des Panzernashornhauses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221003315/http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=37 |date=21 February 2014 }}.

Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call "their" zoo "''Zolli''" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.

=== Sport ===
[[File:Basel, St.-Jakob-Park- pic05.jpg|thumb|[[St. Jakob-Park]]]]
Basel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The [[association football|football]] club [[FC Basel]] continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Championships]], along with [[Geneva]], [[Zürich]] and [[Bern]]. The championships were jointly hosted by [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. [[BSC Old Boys]] and [[Concordia Basel]] are the other football teams in Basel.

Among the most popular sports in Switzerland is [[ice hockey]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info/| title=Popular sports in Switzerland| publisher=popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info| access-date=10 July 2011| archive-date=10 August 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810184111/http://popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info/| url-status=live}}</ref> Basel is home to [[EHC Basel]], who play in the [[1. Liga (ice hockey)|MySports League]], the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seater [[St. Jakob Arena]]. The team previously played in the [[National League (ice hockey)|National League]] and the [[Swiss League]], but had to file for bankruptcy after the [[2013-14 National League B season|2013–14 Swiss League season]].

Amongst its major sports venues, Basel features a large [[St. Jakob-Park|football stadium]] that has been awarded four stars by [[UEFA]], a modern ice hockey arena, and a sports hall.

While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called the [[Swiss Basketball League|SBL]], is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the "Birstal Starwings".

Two players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. As in most European countries, but unlike the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unibaselbasket.ch/english.html|title=English|website=Uni Basel Basket – Der Basketball Verein aus Basel|access-date=14 September 2016|archive-date=27 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627050225/http://www.unibaselbasket.ch/english.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Starwings Basel]] are the only first division basketball team in [[German-speaking Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.indoorsports.ch/de/alle/detail-alle-sportarten/news/detail/News/starwings-die-exoten-aus-basel/ Starwings – die Exoten aus Basel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924162534/http://www.indoorsports.ch/de/alle/detail-alle-sportarten/news/detail/News/starwings-die-exoten-aus-basel/ |date=24 September 2016 }}, indoorsports.ch {{in lang|de}}, accessed 5 September 2015.</ref>
