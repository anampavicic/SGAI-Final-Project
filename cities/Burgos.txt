'''Burgos''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbuɾɣos|lang|Pronunciation_of_Burgos_in_Spanish.ogg}}) is a city in [[Spain]] located in the autonomous community of [[Castile and León]]. It is the capital and most populated municipality of the [[province of Burgos]].

Burgos is situated in the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], on the confluence of the [[Arlanzón (river)|Arlanzón river]] tributaries, at the edge of the [[Meseta Central|central plateau]]. The municipality has a population of about 180,000 inhabitants. The [[Camino de Santiago]] runs through Burgos.

Founded in 885 by the second [[Count of Castile]], [[Diego Rodríguez Porcelos]], Burgos soon became the leading city of the embryonic [[County of Castile]].<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SMNoCP5Aq_IC&pg=PA150|title= Las técnicas y las construcciones en la ingeniería romana|isbn= 978-84-614-3758-0|year=2010|publisher=Fundación de la Ingeniería Técnica de Obras Públicas|page=150|chapter=Introducción al conocimiento de la viaria romana de la cuenca del Duero a través de la documentación altomedieval|first1= García González|last1= Juan José|first2= David|last2= Peterson|first3= Iván|last3= García Izquierdo|first4= Lucía|last4= García Aragón}}</ref> The 11th century chieftain [[El Cid|Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar]] (''El Cid'') had connections with the city: born near Burgos, he was raised and educated there.

==Toponymy==
There are several possible origins for the toponymy. When the city was founded, the inhabitants of the surrounding country moved into the fortified village, whose [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] name of Burgos signified consolidated [[defensive wall|walled]] villages{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} (Gothic ''baurgs'').<ref>Wright, Joseph, 1892, ''A Primer of the Gothic Language'', glossary & section 182.</ref> The cities [[Burgas]] in [[Bulgaria]] and numerous cities containing the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[burg (disambiguation)|burg]] "city" such as [[Hamburg]] have a similar literal composition. The city began to be called ''Caput Castellae'' ("Cabeza de Castilla" or "Head of Castile").<ref name=Catholic/>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Burgos}}
[[Homo antecessor|Early humans]] occupied sites around Burgos as early as 800,000 years ago.
When the Romans took possession of what is now the province of Burgos, the site had been a [[Celts|Celtic]] city. In Roman times, it belonged to [[Hispania Citerior]] ("Hither Spain") and then to [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. In the 5th century, the [[Visigoths]] drove back the [[Suebi]], then the Berbers occupied almost all of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in the 8th century, though only for a very brief period, and left little if any trace of their occupation. King [[Alfonso III of Leon|Alfonso III the Great]] of [[Kingdom of León|León]] reconquered it about the middle of the 9th century, and built several castles for the defence of Christendom, which was then extended through the reconquest of lost territory. The region came to be known as Castile (Latin ''castella''), i.e. "(land of) castles".<ref name=Catholic/>

[[File:Castillo de burgos exteriores.jpg|200px|thumb|Ruins of the [[Castle of Burgos]], of possible Visigothic origin]]
Burgos was founded in 884 as an outpost of this [[Reconquista|expanding Christian frontier]],<ref>Teofilo F. Ruiz, "The Transformation of the Castilian Municipalities: The Case of Burgos 1248–1350" ''Past and Present'' '''77''' (November 1977, pp. 3–32), p. 5.</ref> when Diego Rodríguez "Porcelos", count of [[County of Castile|Castile]], governed this territory with orders to promote the increase of the Christian population; with this end in view he gathered the inhabitants of the surrounding country into one fortified village. The city began to be called ''Caput Castellae'' ("Cabeza de Castilla" or "Head of Castile"). The [[County of Castile|county (''condado'') of Castile]], subject to the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Kings of León]], continued to be governed by counts and was gradually extended;<ref name=Catholic/> one of these counts, Fernán González, established his independence.<ref>It later became the [[Kingdom of Castile]], being sometimes united with Navarre and sometimes with Leon. In the reign of [[St. Ferdinand III]] (c. 1200–1252), Leon and Castile were united, but they continued to be called respectively the Kingdom of Leon and the Kingdom of Castile until the 19th century.</ref>
[[File:Burgos monasterio huelgas lou.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]], founded in 1180]]

In the 11th century, the city became the see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Burgos]] and the capital of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Burgos was a major stop for pilgrims on the [[French Way]] the most popular path to [[Santiago de Compostela]]<ref>The [[Way of St James|Camino de Santiago]] passed directly through the city, where an urban section of it was called the "French Road" (Ruiz 1977:13).</ref> and a centre of trade between the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the south, which attracted an unusually large foreign merchant population, who became part of the city oligarchy and excluded other foreigners.<ref>Ruiz 1977:10.</ref> Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the [[Crown of Castile|kings of León and Castile]] and a favoured burial site. The ''[[consejo]]'' or [[Medieval commune|urban commune]] of Burgos was firmly in the hands of an oligarchic class of ''caballeros villanos'', the "peasant knights" of Burgos, who provided the monarchs with a mounted contingent: in 1255 and 1266 royal charters granted relief from taxes to those citizens of Burgos who owned horses and could arm themselves, provided that they continue to live within the city walls.<ref>Ruiz 1977:6–9.</ref> The merchant oligarchy succeeded the cathedral chapter as the major purchasers of land after 1250; they carried on their mercantile business in common with municipal or royal functions and sent their sons to England and Flanders to gain experience in overseas trade. A few families within the ''[[hermandad]]es'' or confraternities like the Sarracín and Bonifaz succeeded in monopolising the post of ''[[alcalde]]'', or mayor; a special court, the ''alcalde del rey'' was first mentioned at Burgos in 1281.<ref>Ruis 1977:23.</ref> By the reign of [[Alfonso X]], the exemption of the non-noble knights and religious corporations, combined with exorbitant gifts and grants to monasteries and private individuals, placed great stress on the economic well-being of the realm.

In the century following the conquest of [[Seville]] (1248) on the Moors, Burgos became a testing ground for royal policies of increasing power against the ''consejo'', in part by encouraging the right to appeal from the ''consejo'' to the king. In 1285, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] added a new body to the ''consejo'' which came to dominate it: the ''jurado'' in charge of collecting taxes and overseeing public works; the king reserved the right to select its members. The city perceived that danger to its autonomy came rather from an uncontrolled aristocracy during royal minorities: Burgos joined the ''hermandades'' of cities that leagued together for mutual protection in 1295 and 1315. In the 14th century, official royal intrusion in city affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans, on whom the tax burden fell. The ''[[alguacil]]'' was the royal official instituted to judge disagreements.

On 9 June 1345, sweeping aside the city government, [[Alfonso XI]] established direct royal rule of Burgos through the ''Regimiento'' of sixteen appointed men.

[[File:Braun Burgos UBHD.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Burgos, as depicted in the [[Georg Braun]] & [[Frans Hogenberg]]'s ''Civitates Orbis Terrarum'' (c. 1572)]]

In 1574, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] made the bishopric a Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Burgos|archbishopric]], at the request of king [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]].

Burgos has been the scene of many wars: with the [[Moors]], the struggles between León and Navarre, and between Castile and [[Aragon]]. In the [[Peninsular War]] against Napoleonic France, the [[siege of Burgos]] (between 19 September to 21 October) was a scene of a withdrawal for [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. Again in the 19th-century [[Carlist]] civil [[wars of the Spanish succession]] Burgos was the scene of a battle. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Burgos was the base of General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rebel nationalist government.

=== Jewish History ===
Historically, there was a large and thriving [[Jewish]] community in Burgos. Its first documentation dates to 974. In the 13th century, Burgos was the largest Jewish center in northern Castile. Renowned [[Talmudists]] [[Meir Abulafia]], [[Todros ben Joseph Abulafia]], and poet [[Todros ben Judah Halevi Abulafia]] were born in Burgos. In the latter half of the 13th century, many [[kabbalists]] began moving to Burgos. After new restrictions were imposed on Jews, and they began to suffer from more violent acts of antisemitism, many converted to Christianity. The most well-known convert from Burgos, [[Paul of Burgos]], was originally a Spanish Jew named Solomon Halevi. During the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1492, most Jews in Burgos became [[conversos]] rather than fleeing Spain. Those who did went to Portugal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Burgos, Spain |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/burgos |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=26 June 2024}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
At an elevation of {{convert|865|m|0|abbr=out}}, the city of Burgos lies in the transition zone between a [[Cool-summer mediterranean|Warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen ''Csb'') and an [[Oceanic climate]] (Köppen ''Cfb''), with some [[continental climate|continental]] influence resulting from its distance from the sea and higher altitude.  Burgos' climate features chilly and windy winters, due to altitude and an inland location, which always include snow and temperatures below freezing. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain's coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|546|mm|1|abbr=on}} and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as {{convert|-10|°C|0}}, and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of {{convert|27.5|C|1}}. The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was {{convert|-22|C|0}} on 20 January 1885. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|39|C|0}} on 13 August 1987.

==Sights==
Burgos is rich in ancient churches and convents. The three most notable are the cathedral, with its chapel of the Condestables de Castilla (Lords Constable of Castile), the monastery of Las Huelgas and the [[Carthusian]] monastery of Miraflores. Minor notable churches are San Esteban, San Gil (Sancti Aegidii), San Pedro, San Cosme y San Damián, Santiago (Sancti Jacobi), San Lorenzo and San Lesmes (Adelelmi). The Convento de la Merced, occupied by the [[Jesuits]], and the Hospital del Rey are also of historic and architectural interest.<ref name=Catholic/>

Among the other interesting architectural structures, in the walls of the city are the [[Arco de Santa María|gateway of Santa María]], erected for the first entrance of the [[Emperor Charles V]], and the arch of Fernán González.<ref name=Catholic/>

===Gothic Cathedral===
{{Main|Burgos Cathedral}}
Construction on Burgos' [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Cathedral began in 1221 and spanned mainly from the 13th to 15th centuries. It has been declared a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The Cathedral is the resting place for [[El Cid]] (the famous knight from Medieval Spain's history) and his wife Dona Jimena. The west front is flanked by towers terminating in octagonal spires covered with open stonework traceries. The middle section, which serves as an entrance, has three alabaster pilasters, the intercolumnar spaces bearing panel-pictures representing the martyrdom of saints. The façade possesses ornate and fantastic surface decoration.<ref name=Catholic/>

The octagonal chapel of the Condestable, in florid, thus highly sculpted, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] design, has a roof finished with balustraded turrets, needle-pointed pinnacles and statues. In the lower portion, coats of arms, shields and crouching lions have been worked into the ensemble. The exterior of the sacristy is decorated with carved traceries, figures of angels and armoured knights. The elaborate [[tabernacle]] is composed of two octagonal sections in [[Corinthian style]].<ref name=Catholic/>

===Monasterio de las Huelgas===
{{Main|Las Huelgas}}
The ''Monasterio de las Huelgas Reales'' (Monastery of the Royal Retreats) on the outskirts of the city, was founded in 1180 by king [[Alfonso VIII]], and was begun in a pre-Gothic style, although almost every style has been introduced over many additions. The remarkable cloisters have been described as "unrivalled for beauty both of detail and design, and perhaps unsurpassed by anything in its age and style in any part of Europe" (1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''). One cloister has semicircular arches with delicate and varied columns; the other has an ogival style of early Gothic. The interior of the church has enormous columns supporting its magnificent vault; the entrance is modern. This convent historically benefited from extraordinary privileges granted to its abbess by kings and popes.<ref name=Catholic/>

===Miraflores Charterhouse===
{{Main|Miraflores Charterhouse}}
The [[Carthusian]] monastery, Miraflores Charterhouse (''Cartuja de Miraflores'') is situated about four kilometres from the historic city center. Among the treasures of the Charterhouse are the wooden statue of [[Bruno of Cologne|St. Bruno]], the wooden choir stalls in the church and the tombs of King [[John II of Castile|Juan II]] and of his spouse, Queen [[Isabella of Portugal, Queen of Castile|Isabella of Portugal]], constructed of marble and with their [[Tomb effigy|recumbent effigies]] sculpted in [[alabaster]]. Around the top frieze are statues of angels in miniature. The French soldiers in the [[Spanish War of Independence]] (1814) mutilated this work, cutting off some of the heads and carrying them away to France.<ref name=Catholic>{{Catholic|wstitle=Burgos|inline=1}}</ref> King Juan II's daughters by his first wife, heiresses Princesses [[Catherine, Princess of Asturias|Catherine]] and [[Eleanor, Princess of Asturias|Eleanor]] of [[Principality of Asturias|Asturias]], are also buried in the monastery.

=== Castle ===
Located on a hill 75 meters above the city, it is a medieval defensive fortress built during the time of the reconquest. Used by Castilian kings as accommodation and a place for celebrations, it later became an artillery fort and then a weapons factory. After its destruction by the French during the War of Independence in 1813, there are hardly any buildings left standing. From the Castle it is possible to see fantastic views of the city.

==Museums==

==Parks and recreation==

[[File:Parque El Parral.jpg|thumb|right|Parque El Parral]]
[[File:Paseo Isla Lejanía.JPG|thumb|La Isla]]
Most of the parks in the city of Burgos can be found along the river Arlanzón. Indeed, the banks of the river itself constitute a green corridor along the city. In total, there are nearly 3 square miles (1,878 acres) of parks in Burgos and one tree for every 3 inhabitants.

* '''El Parque del Castillo''' (or the Castle Park) is one of the lungs of the city. The city grew from the southern foot of the hill of the castle. Gradually, some of the upper neighborhoods began disappearing. After the destruction of the castle, military installations were established there. In the 1950s, the engineer Jaquotot Mariano, who later became mayor of the city, decided to leave the hill completely bare. Besides the ruins of the castle, this park contains the ''Bird Conservation Center'', as well as play areas for children and spaces for exercise. Also, there is a terraced area with gardens and an ornamental fountain. The highlight of the park is the viewpoint from which you get a great view of the city, especially the cathedral. A metal plaque on the rail at the vista point helps to identify the most characteristic places of the city. The park contains the unique view of the city of Burgos from the viewpoint of the Castle. During special events throughout the year, visitors can see fireworks displays from that same view point. The park can be reached by car where there is parking, and on foot by climbing a series of stairs starting from the church of San Esteban.

[[File:Summer on the "Paseo del Espolón".jpg|thumb|300px|center|Summer on the "Paseo del Espolón"]]
* '''El Paseo de la Isla''' is another one of Burgos' tree-lined garden walks. It passes by the Palacio de la Isla which served as one of Franco's headquarters during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is currently the Language Institute of Castilian and Leonese.
* '''Parque de El Parral''' is located at the old "Hospital del Rey", a former hospital for pilgrims of the "[[Way of St. James|Way of Saint James]]", now part of the [[University of Burgos]] campus.

[[File:Wheat fields in Burgos.jpg|thumb|Wheat fields in the outskirts of Burgos]]

}}</ref>

===Tertiary sector===
It employs the bigger percentage in the city and is represented by the public sector (production, delivery and allocation of goods and services), due to the capital status.

==Culture==
The city has a complete culture infrastructure, remarked by the [[Auditorio y Palacio de Congresos de Burgos]], which opened in mid-2012.

===Language===
[[Spanish language|Spanish]], also called Castilian, originated in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and spread throughout the Crown of Castile's possessions following the [[reconquista]]. It was eventually dispersed throughout the Spanish empire following the conquest and colonization of the Americas, and Spain after the union of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]'s kingdoms being co-spoken with other languages. Of the many different variations and dialects found throughout the world, it's argued that the purest Spanish can be found in the region of Burgos due to the fact that the language first developed here in the 10th century.

The Spanish language can be traced back to the monastery of Valpuesta located {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city of Burgos. The [[Cartularies of Valpuesta|Valpuesta cartularies]] are significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing the earliest words written in Spanish has been officially recognised.
The first utterings of Spanish continued in the "[[Glosas Emilianenses|Silos Glosses]]", recorded in the Burgos monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spain.info/en/conoce/grandes-rutas/rutas/camino_de_la_lengua_castellana/ |title=Travel routes in Spain: The Route of the Spanish language in Spain &#124; Spain.info in english |publisher=Spain.info |access-date=26 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326163556/http://www.spain.info/en/conoce/grandes-rutas/rutas/camino_de_la_lengua_castellana |archive-date=26 March 2013  }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Burgos province is famous in gastronomy for:
{{Multiple image
| image1 = Queso De Burgos 002.JPG
| caption1 = Queso de Burgos
| image2 = Morcilla-burgos 2.jpg
| caption2 = Fried slices of morcilla de Burgos
| direction = vertical
}}

'''Queso de Burgos''', a white cheese which is soft and unctuous (because it is made with [[whey]]). Although originally made with sheep's milk, now cow's milk or mixtures are more common. Each ''[[Comarcas of Castile and León|comarca]]'' (rural district) produces a minor variation, and the major dairies produce an industrial product that is acceptable for people with sensitive digestion.

Burgos is blessed with a moderate climate and this fresh cheese was able to be conserved there without the need for curing of more than 10 days. With the improvement of aseptic industrial production processes this can be extended to about 30 days at a cool 6&nbsp;°C. Its production reaches 35,000 tons annually.

'''Morcilla de Burgos''', a pig's-blood sausage ([[black pudding]]), is a staple country food known across the Iberian peninsula. Spiced with onions and herbs its most noticeable content is rice (often mistaken for fat) which makes it one of the lightest and healthiest products of its kind. Oral tradition says that it must be "salty, smooth and piquant" (see Spanish pages {{ill|Burgos (desambiguación)|es}} for details). As with the Queso de Burgos, several comarcas or towns in the province ([[Cardeñadijo]], [[Sotopalacios]], Aranda de Duero, [[Briviesca]], [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Covarrubias]], [[Villarcayo]], [[Trespaderne]], [[Miranda de Ebro]]...) made their own morcillas, with minor variations between them.

Even though Burgos is not on a D.O. wine is a fundamental piece in local gastronomy thanks to nearby wine cellars from Ribera de Duero, Rioja and [[Arlanza (comarca)|Arlanza]] D.O.

===Festivals===
The city's main festival is San Pedro y San Pablo (also referred to locally as "Sampedros") celebrated on June 29. Every year, for about two weeks, the city celebrates with fireworks, concerts, sports, folklore, games for children, theater and other activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aytoburgos.es/cultura/fiestas/san-pedro-y-san-pablo|title=San Pedro y San Pablo {{!}} Ayuntamiento de Burgos|website=www.aytoburgos.es|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>

[[File:HighSpeedSpain.svg|thumb|Map of the Spanish high-speed railway network]]
The city is considered a first-class rail route through which one rail lines circulate, operated by [[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]]: [[Madrid–Hendaye railway]]. The faster trains use the AVE line between Madrid and Valladolid.

2010 marked 150 years since the arrival of the first railway to the city; the first train was present on 25 October 1860. Madrid was joined with the French border and this was considered the main route of railway communication between Spain and Europe. Located at the halfway point, Burgos soon become an important hub of communications between the centre and the north.

Since December 2007, the city has been connected to the main provincial capitals by high-speed service [[Alvia]]. It also provides other services, middle and long distance, which connect with the main population centres of the country. 18 long distance trains and 12 middle distance trains circulate through the station each day, which results in around 330,000 yearly users.

The new railway station was opened on 12 December 2008 under the name [[Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station|Burgos-Rosa de Lima]], belonging to ADIF. It is located in the neighbourhood of Villímar, northeast of the city, and was adapted for the arrival of [[AVE]]. Bus 25 takes travellers direct to the city centre.

In July 2022, [[AVE]] high speed trains started serving the city, connecting it to cities such as [[Madrid]] in 1 hour and 33 minutes with a stop in [[Valladolid]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elindependiente.com/economia/transporte/2022/06/30/el-trayecto-en-ave-madrid-burgos-se-reducira-a-1-hora-y-33-minutos/ |title=El trayecto en AVE Madrid-Burgos se reducirá a 1 hora y 33 minutos |date=30 June 2022 |access-date=1 November 2022 |newspaper=El Independiente |language=es}}</ref> or [[Bilbao]] in 70 minutes. Starting in January 2023, AVE will connect Burgos to Valencia in 3 hours and 30 minutes without the need to transfer in Madrid.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.burgosconecta.es/burgos/conectara-burgos-valencia-20221027191056-nt.html |title=El AVE conectará Burgos con Valencia en tres horas y media a partir de enero |first=Alejandro |last=Rodríguez |date=27 October 2012 |access-date=1 November 2022 |newspaper=Burgos Conecta |publisher=[[Vocento]] |language=es}}</ref>

===Trams===
A project to implement a tram for the city has been planned, which would run the length of the Boulevard, officially called the Avenida de Valencia. It would consist of a line of about {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} long and will originate from the Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station and end at the [[University of Burgos]]. Its cost is estimated between 80 and 120 million euros.

Due to the economic crisis and real estate, the project has been postponed temporarily until further funding becomes available. In February 2010 work began on the development of the Boulevard, which reserves a lane for public transport: first buses, and eventually the tram.

===Bus===
Burgos has an international bus station located in the city centre, just one hundred meters from the [[Cathedral of Burgos|Cathedral]]. It connects the city with nearly every region of Spain, as well as with a wide number of European ([[Amsterdam]], [[Basel]], [[Bern]], [[Bratislava]], [[Brussels]], [[Cologne]], [[Hamburg]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Geneva]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Kyiv]], [[Lisbon]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Lviv]], [[Łódź]], [[London]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Moscow]], [[Munich]], [[Nice]], [[Paris]], [[Porto]], [[Prague]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Sofia]], [[The Hague]], [[Warsaw]], [[Zürich]]) and even [[North African]] ([[Casablanca]], [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]]) cities.
