The origin of the name Osnabrück is disputed. The suffix ''-brück'' suggests a bridge over or to something (from German ''Brücke'' = bridge) but the prefix ''Osna-'' is explained in at least two different ways: the traditional explanation is that today's name is a corruption{{clarify|reason=Folk etymology? phonetic evolution? mistranslation from Low German?|date=August 2023}} of ''Ossenbrügge'' (westphalian meaning "oxen bridge"), which is etymologically and historically impossible, because the town is older than this corruption of consonants (documented in 13th century, Osnabrück was founded in 8th century), but others state that it is derived from the name of the ''Hase'' River which is arguably derived from ''Asen'' ([[Æsir]]), thus giving Osnabrück the meaning "bridge to the gods",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bne.uni-osnabrueck.de/Hase/Hasebuch1Abschnitt1|title=Environmental Education at the University of Osnabrück|publisher=Umweltbildung.uni-osnabrueck.de|language=de|access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref> and previously Tacitus named people living near the grey river (Hase) [[Chasuarii]]. It may also be noted that Osnabrück is situated on the northern end of the [[Teutoburg Forest]], which until the 19th century was known as the Osning.{{cn|date=April 2023}}
The city gave its name to the textile fabric of [[osnaburg]].

===Medieval===
Osnabrück initially developed as a marketplace next to the bishopric founded by [[Charlemagne]], King of the [[Kingdom of the Franks|Franks]], in 780.  Some time prior to 803, the city became the seat of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück]].  Although the precise date is uncertain, it is likely that Osnabrück is the oldest bishopric in Lower Saxony.

In the year 804 Charlemagne was said to have founded the [[Gymnasium Carolinum (Osnabrück)|Gymnasium Carolinum in Osnabrück]].  This would make it the oldest German [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] school, but the charter date is disputed by historians, some of whom believe it could be a forgery.

In 889 the town was given merchant, customs, and coinage privileges by King [[Arnulf of Carinthia]]. Osnabrück was first referred to in records as a "city" in 1147. A decade later, Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] granted the city [[fortification]] privileges (''Befestigungsrecht'').  Most of the towers which were part of the original fortifications are still visible in the city.  Osnabrück became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in the 12th century, as well as a member of the [[Westphalian Federation of Cities]].

The history of the town in the later Middle Ages was recorded in a chronicle by [[Albert Suho]], one of Osnabrück's most important clerics in the 15th century.

===Early Modern age===
From 1561 to 1639 there was a considerable amount of social unrest and tension in Osnabrück due to the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Thirty Years' War]] and also witch hunting.  In 1582, during the rule of Mayor Hammacher (1565–1588), 163 women were executed as alleged witches; most of them were burned alive. In total, 276 women were executed, along with 2 men who had been charged with wizardry.

The first [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] services were held in Osnabrück in 1543. Over the next century, Lutheranism expanded in the city and several Protestant bishops were elected. However, the Catholic churches continued to operate, and the city never became completely Lutheran. After the Thirty Years' War broke out, a Catholic bishop was elected in 1623, and the city was occupied by troops of the Catholic League in 1628.<ref name="greengrass2014">{{cite book|last1=Greengrass|first1=Mark|title=Christendom Destroyed: Europe 1517–1648|date=2014|publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780698176256|quote=Both cities carried the scars o the war, but Osnabrück suffered worse, subjected to the troops of the Catholic League (1628-32) and a forcible Catholicization, and then Swedish war contributions.}}</ref> The [[Gymnasium Carolinum (Osnabrück)|Gymnasium Carolinum]] was upgraded to a [[Jesuit]] university in 1632, but the university was closed a year later when the city was [[Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War|taken by Swedish troops]] and restored to Protestant control.

[[File:Osnabrück Bischöfliche Residenz (1777)@01.JPG|thumb|The Prince-Bishop's Palace, 1777]]

Peace negotiations took place in Osnabrück and the nearby city of [[Münster]] from 1643 to 1648. The twin Treaties of Osnabrück and Münster, collectively known as the [[Peace of Westphalia]], ended the Thirty Years' War. Osnabrück was officially recognized as bi-confessional Catholic and Lutheran. The [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück|prince-bishopric]] would be held alternately by a Catholic bishop and a Lutheran bishop. The Protestant bishop would be selected from the descendants of the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], with priority given to the [[Cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] of what became the [[House of Hanover]]. From 1667, prince-bishop [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus]], Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]], built the new baroque palace. His son, [[George I of Great Britain]], died in the palace, at the time residence of his younger brother, prince-bishop [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany]], on a travel on 11 June 1727.

In the early 18th century, renowned local jurist and social theorist [[Justus Möser]] wrote a highly influential constitutional history of the town, the ''Osnabrücker Geschichte''.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|pp=15–16}} Following the [[Seven Years' War]], the town's population fell below 6,000, however an economic revival linked to the [[linen]] and tobacco industries caused it to rise again from the 1780s onwards.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=15}}

===19th century===
The [[French Revolutionary Wars]] brought [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] troops into the city in 1795, followed by the French in 1803.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=16}} As a result, the town's population was kept below 10,000 for the whole first decade of the 19th century.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=16}} The Napoleonic period saw possession of the city change hands several times. Control of Osnabrück passed to the [[Electorate of Hanover]] in 1803 during the [[German Mediatisation]], and then briefly to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1806. From 1807 to 1810 the city was part of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], after which it passed to the [[First French Empire]]. After 1815, it became part of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]].

[[File:OS-Dom.JPG|upright|thumb|St. Peter's Cathedral]]

The town's first railway line was built in 1855, connecting it with [[Löhne]]. Further rail connections appeared over the following decades, connecting Osnabrück with [[Emden]] from 1856, [[Cologne]] from 1871 and [[Hamburg]] from 1874.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=16-17}} In 1866, Osnabrück was annexed by Prussia after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and administered as part of the [[Province of Hanover]]. Growth of the local economy and population was fuelled by expansion in the engineering and textile industries, with the Hammersen Weaving Mill established in 1869 and the ''Osnabrücker Kupfer- und Drahtwerk'' metallurgical firm following in 1873.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=16}} The later 19th century also saw growth in the number of schools and the arrival of electricity and modern sanitation.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=17}}

===20th century===
By 1914, Osnabrück had over 70,000 inhabitants.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=16}} The outbreak of the [[First World War]] necessitated food rationing; the Allied blockade and a harsh winter in 1917 led to further shortages.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=17}} Following Germany's defeat in 1918, a council made up of workers and soldiers took control during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]], but were replaced by the new [[Weimar Republic]] the following year.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=17-18}} Similarly to many other German cities, Osnabrück experienced considerable inflation and unemployment in the 1920s, with over 2,000 out of work by 1923 and nearly 14,000 receiving some form of government assistance by 1928.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=18}}

Politically, Osnabrück in the 1920s was a stronghold of support for the Social Democrats and the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. However, in the Reichstag elections of September 1930, the [[Nazi Party]] received the greatest percentage of votes in the city (nearly 28%) – a more than seven-fold increase from their electoral performance in Osnabrück two years prior.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=37}} During the campaigns prior to the two federal elections in 1932, both [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] made well-attended speeches in the city.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=44}}

[[File:Osnabrück Süden.JPG|thumb|Southern part of the inner city]]

Following the Nazis' seizure of power in January 1933, Osnabrück was subjected to the implementation of National Socialist economic, political, and social programmes. These resulted in economic growth for ethnic Germans who did not run afoul of the new regime, and the town went from having over 10,000 unemployed in early 1933 to actually having a labour shortage five years later.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=55}} However, dissenters, supporters of opposition parties and [[German Jews]] (who had experienced centuries of discrimination in the city<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11788-osnabruck|title=OSNABRÜCK |website=jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref>) did not share in this growth and found themselves discriminated against, imprisoned or forced to close their businesses and leave town.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=23-24,81, 186–200}} During [[World War II]], both Jews and [[Romani people]] were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s en masse.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=197-98,211}} In October 1942, a subcamp of the 2nd [[SS construction brigade]] ([[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camp) in [[Bremen]] was established in Osnabrück.<ref name=2SS>{{cite web|url=https://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de/en/history/satellite-camps/satellite-camps/osnabrueck-2nd-ss-construction-brigade/|title=Osnabrück (2nd SS Construction Brigade)|website=KZ-Gedenkstätte Neuengamme|access-date=24 October 2023}}</ref> 86 of the 250 prisoners died of starvation and maltreatment before the subcamp's dissolution in May 1943.<ref name=2SS/> Osnabrück was also the location of the Oflag VI-C and Oflag 66 [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camps]] for Serbian, [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]] and Belgian officers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945.

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}The war ended for Osnabrück on 4 April 1945, when the [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XVII Corps]] of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]]  [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery's]] [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] entered the city with little resistance.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=137}} By this time, the city had been extensively bombed and required major reconstructive programmes following the war's end. Leading Nazis fled the city and the British appointed a new mayor, Johannes Petermann. However, during the [[Allied-occupied Germany|allied occupation of Germany]] a British military governor, Colonel Geoffrey Day was placed in charge of administering the city.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=135,137}} Relations between the occupiers and the citizens of Osnabrück were generally peaceful, though tensions existed; some minor fights broke out between British soldiers and local youths and some Osnabrückers resented the relationships that developed between the occupiers and local women.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=136-37}} Additionally, the British took over more than seventy homes for their own use by the middle of 1946.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=150-51}} Amidst shortages, the black market thrived and became one of the main focuses of police activity.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=153-56}}

After World War II [[West Germany]] realigned its states; Osnabrück became part of the new state of [[Lower Saxony]] in 1946. The British continued to maintain [[Osnabrück Garrison]], a garrison near the city, which at one point was the largest British [[garrison]] in the world, housing some 4,000 troops and employing around 500 local civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ioe.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo=='BFE/B/3') |title=IOE Archives |publisher=Archive.ioe.ac.uk |access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref> It was the target of a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|PIRA]] [[Osnabrück mortar attack|attack in 1996]].<ref>[[Tony Geraghty|Geraghty, Tony]] (2000).

After three centuries, the city finally obtained its university when the government of Lower Saxony established the [[University of Osnabrück]] in 1974.

===Twinning with Derby===
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2023}}
Previously Osnabrück had made contact with the British authorities as early as 1948, hoping to find an English [[Sister city|twin town]] and therefore achieve greater understanding with their former enemies in the Second World War. This attempt was unsuccessful and Osnabrück did not actively consider the idea again for another quarter-century. The twinning agreement with Derby was signed on 17 February 1976.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Town twinning |url=https://www.derby.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/tourism-travel/town-twinning/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231015221141/https://www.derby.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/tourism-travel/town-twinning/ |archive-date=15 October 2023 |access-date=15 October 2023 |website=Derby City Council}}</ref> Every year since then the two cities have exchanged envoys. Derby also has a square named after Osnabrück in honour of the twinning arrangement; this features an obelisk among other things.
