In 1871 this district was reformed joining the Sub-divisions viz. Solapur, [[Barshi]], Mohol, Madha and Karmala and two Subdivisions of [[Satara district]] viz.

The Padmashalis are one of the largest community in Solapur. The rise of Moghul rule and there after Britishers who came to India for doing cloth business has lot of impact on weaving technology. The cloth manufactured at Birmingham, England can sell at cheaper rate in India and the qualities of their cloth were much better than our hand woven cloths on Gunta Maggam (Pit-loom). Since there is no buyer for our hand woven cloths, the domestic textile industry suffered losses. The Britisher established East India Company at Calcutta and spread their business across the India. They have also ruled our country till 1947. The impact of cloth business compelled Padmashalis to move to different places in India. Maharashtra is adjacent to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh; most of them started moving in search of their livelihood. Earlier days there were no transportation available; people started walking from Telangana and stayed for days together wherever in the en route to Mumbai. In this course some of them even settled in most parts of Maharashtra like Nanded, Jalna, Aurangabad, and Nasik, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Pune and even interior parts of the villages. Their
basic occupation was weaving; hence most of them have chosen weaving job in cotton mills. Gradually the strength has increased and it can be witnessed that about 400 to 500 Padmashalis could be seen in each mill in Mumbai. Most of the people in Solapur are started there Textile.

There is also one of the oldest Ganesh temples, Manacha Shri Ajoba Ganpati temple, which started celebrating the Ganesh festival from 1885.Lokmanya Tilak is inspired from this as peoples are coming and doing activities as a group, when he visited Solapur and then he started Ganesh Festival in Pune in 1893.
