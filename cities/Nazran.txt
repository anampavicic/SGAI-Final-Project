'''Nazran''' ({{langx|ru|Назра́нь}}; {{langx|inh|Наьсаре
|Näsare}}) is the largest [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Ingushetia]], [[Russia]]. It served as the republic's [[capital city|capital]] from 1991 to 2000, until it was replaced by [[Magas]], which was built for this purpose. It is the most populous city in the republic: {{ru-census|p2021=122,350|p2010=93,335|p2002=125,066|p1989=18,246}}

== Etymology ==
The name of the town, possibly, derives from the name of the legendary first settler ''Nyasar'' ({{langx|inh|Наьсар}}, also referred as ''Närt-Näsar'' {{langx|inh|Наьрт-Наьсар|lit=Hero Näsar|links=no}}).{{sfn|Kurkiev|1978|p=21}}{{sfn|Kurkiev|1979|p=217}}{{efn|Alimbek Kurkiev who held this point of view, did not rule out the possibility of certain connection of 'Nazran' with the mineral water {{ill|Narzan|ru|Нарзан}}, found in present-day [[Stavropol Krai]], or with the [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] name of [[Kislovodsk]], {{transliteration|kbd|Nartsanē{{noitalic|/}}Nartsana}} ({{langx|kbd|Нарцанэ/Нартсана|links=no}}).{{sfn|Kurkiev|1979|p=217}}}}

The town is associated by some scholars like {{ill|Leonid Lavrov|ru|Лавров, Леонид Иванович}} with the Arabic word "al nasaraa" ({{lang|ar|النصارى}}),{{efn|In [[Russian language|Russian]] [[transliteration]] of {{ill|Leonid Lavrov|ru|Лавров, Леонид Иванович}} ''насрāнӣй''.}} meaning "[[Christian]]", thus explaining that the name was gotten from the fact that supposedly [[Christianity]] held on for longer in Nazran unlike in other neighboring places in [[Ingushetia]]. Although author explains that [[Muslim]]s already were present here in 1405–1406.{{sfn|Lavrov|1966|p=200}} Vladimir 
Markovin also stated that the name of Nazran has an [[Arabic]] origin while quoting Lavrov.{{sfn|Markovin|1987|p=39}}{{efn|Markovin used this as one of the arguments that the spread [[Christianity]] by [[Georgians]] had strong influence on [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]], in particularly their [[culture]] and [[language]].{{sfn|Markovin|1987|p=39}}}}

== History ==
=== 18th–20th centuries ===
[[File:Nasranova.jpg|300px|thumb|''Nasranova'' (Nazran) on the Map "Carte de la partie septentrionale de l'empire otoman" made by Giovanni Antonio Rizzi Zannoni in 1774.]]
[[File:Memorial of memory and glory in Nazran 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Memorial of Memory and Glory]]

The ''[[aul]]'' of Nazran was founded in the late 18th century,{{sfn|БСЭ|1939}} with the official date of the foundation being considered 1781.<ref name="about">{{cite web|title=General Information|url=https://nazrangrad.ru/nash-gorod-nazran/|publisher=Irkutsk Oblast|language=russian|access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref> This is based on the report of L. L. Shteder, who during his expedition to Caucasus in 1781, noticed Ingush outposts on the river of {{ill|Nazranka|ru|Назранка}}.{{sfn|Pallas (Shteder)|1797|page=26}}
After becoming a military fortress in 1817, Nazran saw large numbers of [[Ingush people|Ingush]] population moving into it. It was granted town status in 1967.<ref name="about"/>

During the [[Russian Empire]], the settlement was the administrative capital of the [[Nazranovsky Okrug]] of the [[Terek Oblast]]. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, Nazran was the [[administrative center]] of [[Nazranovsky District]] within the [[Chechen–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. After the Republic of Ingushetia and the [[Chechen Republic]] were separated in 1991, the town became the republic's capital. This brought about a sharp increase in population: while counting 18,246 inhabitants according to the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 Census]],<ref name="1989Census">{{ru-pop-ref|1989Census}}</ref> during the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]] Nazran had as many as 125,056 inhabitants.<ref name="2002Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2002Census}}</ref>

==== 2004 rebel raid on Nazran ====
{{Main|2004 Nazran raid}}

In 2004, a group of [[Chechen people|Chechen]] and Ingush militants<ref>{{Cite book|editor=Редакция газеты Ежедневная Деловая Газета Рбк|date=2019-12-17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSi1BwAAQBAJ&dq=%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5+%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8C&pg=PA3|title=Ежедневная деловая газета РБК 227-2014|publisher=Litres|page=3|isbn=9785457744660|via=Google Books}}</ref> carried out a [[2004 Nazran raid|large-scale raid]] on Ingushetia, led by [[Shamil Basayev]]. The overnight attacks targeted fifteen official buildings in Nazran, and at least three towns and villages located on the Baku-Rostov highway that crosses the republic from east to west.

The raid lasted nearly five hours, and the assailants - said to number 200 to 300 - withdrew almost unscathed; the raiders apparently lost only two men during the attacks. The rebels killed 67 members of security forces, including the republic's Interior Minister Abukar Kostoyev, his deputy Zyaudin Kotiev, top prosecutors, and other officials; they also captured and looted the [[MVD]]'s armory and police depots. 25 civilians, including a local [[United Nations]] worker, were killed in the crossfire.

Federal Interior Minister [[Rashid Nurgaliyev]] met with General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, the commander of Russia's Interior Ministry forces, and blamed them for the high number of deaths. Tikhomirov decided to resign after the meeting.

==== 2008 protests ====
Widespread protests erupted in January 2008, with a strong government response.   The disturbances appear to have been fueled by heavy-handed government and para-military activity, including abductions, arrests and murders.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7211046.stm "Clashes erupt at Ingushetia rally"] ([[BBC News]], 26 January 2008)</ref>  Protesters demanded the resignation of President Zyazikov.

==== 2009 bombing ====
{{Main|2009 Nazran bombing}}

In August 2009, a suicide bomber drove a truck filled with explosives into the Nazran police headquarters. Russian news agencies reported that 25 were killed in the attack, and roughly 140 were wounded. It is believed that more bodies may still be in the rubble, yet to be found. The police headquarters was completely destroyed in the attack, including up to 30 police vehicles and munition stores.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-ingushetia-bomb18-2009aug18,0,5539599.story "Bombing kills 20 in Russian republic of Ingushetia"] (''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 18 August 2009)</ref>
