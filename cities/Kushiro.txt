{{Nihongo|'''Kushiro'''|釧路市|Kushiro-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Kushiro Subprefecture]] on the island of [[Hokkaido]], Japan. Located along the coast of the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]], it serves as the subprefecture's capital and it is the most populated city in the eastern part of the island.

==History==
An Imperial decree in July 1899 established Kushiro as an open port for trading with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>US Department of State. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKCOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA759&dq=  ''A digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties and other international agreements'' (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759].</ref>

Kushiro had been an important [[port]] because it is more reliably ice-free during winter than alternative [[Russian Far East]] [[warm-water port]]s such as [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] or other ports in Hokkaido such as [[Hakodate, Hokkaido|Hakodate]], which occasionally freeze for short periods due to the lower [[salinity]] of the Sea of Japan. For this reason, Kushiro was considered a valuable target for the [[Tsar]]s during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]s. Its importance grew during the 1920s with the growth of commercial fishing, for which its reliable freedom from ice reduced costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/JPN_Port_of_Kushiro_1446.php|title=Port of Kushiro|website=World Port Source}}</ref>

In addition to its port, Kushiro is serviced by [[Kushiro Airport]] with flights from [[Honshu]] and by the ''[[Ōzora (train)|Ōzora]]'' limited express train service, which runs six times per day to the main population centres in the west of Hokkaido.

In July 1945 the city of Kushiro was [[Air raids on Japan#Naval air attacks|bombed by American naval aircraft]]; hundreds of people, mostly civilians, were killed.<ref name="Asahi Shimbun">{{Cite web |last=[[The Asahi Shimbun]] |title=朝日新聞デジタル：空襲の記憶 風化させぬ - 北海道 - 地域 |url=http://www.asahi.com/area/hokkaido/articles/MTW20151209011470014.html |access-date=April 13, 2022 |website=www.asahi.com |language=ja |archive-date=April 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414064109/http://www.asahi.com/area/hokkaido/articles/MTW20151209011470014.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Following the [[Invasion of the Kuril Islands]] in August 1945, Kushiro was favoured by the Russians as the eastern cornerstone of a border between an American-occupied south and a Soviet-occupied north-coupled with [[Rumoi, Hokkaido|Rumoi]] as the western cornerstone. However, [[Proposed Soviet invasion of Hokkaido|these plans]] were cancelled after pressure by US President [[Harry S. Truman]].<ref>Holloway, David, ‘Jockeying for Position in the Postwar World: Soviet Entry into the War with Japan in August 1945’, in ''The End of the Pacific War: Reappraisals'', ed. by Tsuyoshi Hasegawa (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2007), pp. 145-188 (pp. 178-179).</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IB4gFHYiDREC&q=soviet+invasion+hokkaido+rumoi&pg=PA237 |title=Stars and Stripes Across the Pacific: The United States, Japan, and Asia page 237 |last=Nimmo |first=William F |year=2001 |isbn=9780275964535 |access-date=December 18, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Gregory |date=August 22, 2014 |title=How WWII could have ended |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2014/08/22/commentary/japan-commentary/how-wwii-could-have-ended/ |work=[[Japan Times]] |access-date=December 18, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/122335 |title=REPORT BY IVAN YUMASHEV TO ALEKSANDR VASILEVSKY |last=Yumashev |first=Ivan |date=August 19, 1945 |access-date=December 18, 2017 }}</ref>

On October 11, 2005, the town of [[Akan, Hokkaido|Akan]], from [[Akan District, Hokkaido|Akan District]], and the town of [[Onbetsu, Hokkaido|Onbetsu]], from [[Shiranuka District, Hokkaido|Shiranuka District]], was merged into Kushiro. The town of [[Shiranuka]] now lies between the two sections of Kushiro.

In 2008, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 189,539 and a total area of {{convert|1,362.75|km2|abbr=on}}, giving a [[population density]] of 140 persons per km<sup>2</sup> (363 persons per sq. mi.).

Kushiro was one of the many Japanese cities to receive a [[Peace Pagoda]]. Built by the monks and nuns of the Buddhist order [[Nipponzan Myohoji]], it was inaugurated in 1959.

Kushiro was accorded city status on August 1, 1922.
It is the sister city of [[Burnaby]], British Columbia; [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]], Russia; and [[Kholmsk]], Russia.<ref>[http://gsti.miis.edu/CEAS-PUB/2003_Aka-Vass.pdf Russian presence in Japan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817133052/http://gsti.miis.edu/CEAS-PUB/2003_Aka-Vass.pdf |date=August 17, 2011 }}</ref>

===Climate===
Kushiro has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'') but its winter temperatures are less severe than those of inland East Asia at the same latitude. Its port is the most reliably ice-free throughout winter in all of Hokkaido, due to the lack of indentation in the coastline and absence of large inflows of cold [[fresh water]] nearby. It is also markedly sunnier than the extremely gloomy [[Kuril Islands]] to its north, being sheltered by Hokkaido's mountains from the heavy snowfalls produced on the [[Sea of Japan]] side by the [[Aleutian Low]]. It receives only a third as much snowfall as [[Sapporo]] and almost twice as much sunshine as the Kuril Islands are estimated to. Its daytime summer temperatures are noticeably cooler than in the interior, sheltered coastal areas and the south coast of Hokkaido.
