== History ==
Castanhal was officially founded on January, 28th of 1932 (date of certification) and received its name due to the common nut trees (portug: Castanha) around the train station of the Bragança - Belém railway. Workers from the Brazilian Northeast started settling around the station. Local farmers started selling their products at the new market. Though, the new marketplace Castanhal was founded.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} The Bragança railway was shut down in 1964 and the rails were removed.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} The government of the state of Pará gave Castanhal the nickname "cidade modelo" (Model Town).
In 2004, Pope John Paul II erected the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Castanhal|diocese of Castanhal]], which is subordinated as a suffragan diocese to the archdiocese of Belém, Pará.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}
