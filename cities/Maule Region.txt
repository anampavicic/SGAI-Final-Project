The '''Maule Region''' ({{langx|es|Región del Maule}}, {{IPA|es|ˈmawle|pron}}) is one of [[Chile]]'s 16 first order [[Administrative divisions of Chile|administrative divisions]]. Its [[Capital (political)|capital]] is [[Talca]]. The region derives its name from the [[Maule River]] which, running westward from the [[Andes]], bisects the region and spans a [[Drainage basin|basin]] of about 20,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The Maule river is of considerable historic interest because, among other reasons, it marked the southern limits of the [[Inca Empire]].

==Geography and ecology==
{{See also|Maulino forest}}
The region covers an area of {{convert|30296|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]]; on the east by the [[Argentina]]; on the north by the [[O'Higgins Region]], and on the south by the [[Ñuble Region]].

From west to east, the region extends from the Pacific coast over the [[Chilean Coast Range]] (Cordillera de la Costa) to include a portion of the [[Chilean Central Valley]], and the [[Andes]] mountains from the foothills to the crest.

There are a number of flora and fauna species present in Maule. For example, the [[endangered]] [[Jubaea|Chilean wine palm]] (''Jubaea chilensis'') is found in a very limited distribution that includes the Maule Region.<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20121017013207/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82831] ''Chilean Wine Palm: Jubaea chilensis'' GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg</ref> The limited-range and endangered trees ''[[Nothofagus alessandrii]]'' and ''[[Gomortega keule]]'' are also found in the region.<ref>Evans, Julian (2008). ''The Forests Handbook, Volume 2: Applying Forest Science for Sustainable Management''. Wiley-Blackwell, April 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-470-75683-6}}</ref>

Protected areas in the region include [[Altos de Lircay National Reserve]], [[Federico Albert National Reserve]], 
[[Laguna Torca National Reserve]], [[Los Bellotos del Melado National Reserve]], [[Los Queules National Reserve]], [[Los Ruiles National Reserve]], and [[Radal Siete Tazas National Park]].

==Demography==
{{More citations needed|date=August 2010}}
According to the 2017 [[census]], the population of the region was 1,033,197. With one third of its population living in [[rural area]]s, Maule has a greater proportion of rural inhabitants than any other region of Chile. Its most populated city is the regional capital, Talca, with 235,000 inhabitants, followed by Curicó (120,700) and Linares (127,000). Other important cities are: Constitución (50,914), Parral (47,000), Cauquenes (43,000), Molina (42,000) and San Javier (40,000).

===Population density===
The average density of the Maule Region is 34.1 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, with less dense areas towards the mountains, and dense areas in the [[Chilean Central Valley|central valley]].

===Composition by age and sex===
According to the composition pyramid of the population of the Region, those younger than fifteen years old are becoming greater in number than the adult population.  The annual growth rate of the population of the Maule Region is 1.06%; this comparatively low figure arises from the low birth rate in the Region. The average life expectancy in the Region is 76.3 years.

==Economy==

[[Forestry]] and [[agriculture]], led by wine grape plantations, are the main economic activities. The Maule region is Chile's leading wine-making region, producing 50% of all the country's fine export wines, and a number of the largest vineyards are located here. Owing to its high concentration of vineyards, the [[Curicó Province#Curicó Valley wine region|Curicó Valley]], which means "black water" in [[Mapudungun]], is considered the core of Chile's wine industry. Wine-making is a traditional activity, some vineyards dating back to 1830. The increased wine-growing area is matched by the development of the industry's infrastructure, technology, and equipment.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

In addition to wine, two export-oriented agricultural items have emerged dynamically: fruit, vegetables and flowers.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Electricity, gas and water are the second most important economic activity. The Maule River feeds five hydroelectric power plants, including the [[Colbún]]-[[Machicura]] complex.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Political divisions==
The four [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]] of the Maule Region are divided into 30 [[Communes of Chile|communes]].

==History==

===Heritage===
The Maule Region has produced a remarkable number of famous men and women, in particular writers and poets but also, [[politician|statesmen]] and presidents, scientists and [[Natural history|naturalist]]s, churchmen, musicians and [[folklorist]]s, journalists and historians. Thus, the Maule river, the long and wide artery that runs through the region, has been considered Chile's [[literature|literary]] river ''par excellence''. Many novels and short stories have had the river as their main background or protagonist. Several anthologies, author's dictionaries and [[essay]]s have given their account of the cultural wealth of the region.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The region boasts of many small towns and villages with well-preserved colonial rural architecture, both in the religious as well as the civil fields. The [[Diocese of Talca|Talca]] and [[Diocese of Linares, Chile|Linares]] dioceses (the two Roman  [[Catholic]] [[diocese]]s in the Maule region) have several [[parish church]]es of particular beauty and architectural and historic value.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}
