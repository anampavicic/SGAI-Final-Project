'''Plovdiv''' ({{langx|bg|Пловдив}}, {{IPA|bg|ˈpɫɔvdif|pron}}) is the [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|second-largest city]] in [[Bulgaria]], 93 miles southeast of the capital [[Sofia]]. It had a population of 371 536 {{As of|2024|lc=y||df=US}} and 675,000 in the greater metropolitan area. Plovdiv is a cultural hub in Bulgaria and was the [[European Capital of Culture]] in 1999 and 2019. The city is an important economic, transport, cultural, and educational centre. Plovdiv joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.

Plovdiv is in a fertile region of south-central Bulgaria on the two banks of the [[Maritsa River]]. The city has historically developed on seven [[syenite]] hills, some of which are {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} high. Because of these hills, Plovdiv is often referred to in Bulgaria as "The City of the Seven Hills". There is evidence of habitation in the area dating back to the 6th millennium BCE, when the first [[Neolithic]] settlements were established. The city was subsequently a [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement, later being conquered and ruled also by [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Macedonians]], [[Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe|Celts]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Thraco-Roman]]s, [[Bulgars]], [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic tribes]], [[Latin Empire|Crusaders]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]].<ref name="plovdiv1"/>

Philippopolis ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Φιλιππούπολις) was founded as a ''[[polis]]'' by the father of [[Alexander the Great]], [[Philip the Great]] ({{Reign|359|336|era=BCE}}), the king of ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], settling there both Thracians and 2,000 [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] ([[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]]) in 342 BCE.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Hammond|first=Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière|title=Philippopolis|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001/acref-9780199545568-e-4980|work=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|volume=|pages=|year=2012|editor-last=Hornblower|editor-first=Simon|edition=4th|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-954556-8|access-date=2020-12-27|author-link=N.

In the [[Middle Ages]], Philippopolis fell to the [[Bulgars]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in 863, during the reign of [[Boris I]] ({{Reign|852|889}}), having been briefly abandoned by the Christian inhabitants in 813 during a dispute with the ''[[Khan of Bulgaria|khan]]'' [[Krum]] ({{Reign|{{circa|803}}|814}}).<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" /> During the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian wars]], the emperor [[Basil the Bulgar-Slayer]] ({{Reign|960|1025}}) used Philippopolis as a major strategic fortification, governed by the ''[[protospatharios]]'' [[Nikephoros Xiphias]].<ref name=":1" /> In the middle 11th century, the city was attacked by the [[Pechenegs]], who occupied it briefly around 1090.<ref name=":1" /> The city continued to prosper, with the walls restored in the 12th century, during which the historian and politician [[Niketas Choniates]] was its governor and the physician [[Michael Italikos]] was its [[metropolitan bishop]].<ref name=":1" /> According to the Latin historian of the [[Fourth Crusade]], [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], Philippopolis was the third largest city in the Byzantine Empire, after [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and [[Thessalonica]] ([[Thessaloniki]]).<ref name=":1" /> It suffered damage from the armies passing through the city during the [[Crusades]] as well as from sectarian violence between the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Armenian Orthodox]] and [[Paulician]] denominations.<ref name=":1" /> The city was destroyed by [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] ({{Reign|1196|1207}}) in 1206 and rebuilt thereafter.<ref name=":1" /> In 1219, the city became the capital of the Crusader [[Duchy of Philippopolis]], part of the [[Latin Empire]].<ref name=":1" /> The [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] recovered the city in 1263, but lost it to Byzantine control before recapturing it in 1323.<ref name=":1" /> The [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered Philippopolis ({{langx|tr|Filibe}}) in 1363 or 1364.<ref name=":1" /> During the 500 years of Ottoman rule, Filibe served as one of the important commercial and transportation nodes in the Ottoman Balkans. It also played a role as an administrative centre of various [[sanjak]]s and [[eyalet]]s.

On 4 January 1878, at the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], Plovdiv was taken away from Ottoman rule by the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army. It remained within the borders of Bulgaria until July of the same year, when it became the capital of the autonomous Ottoman region of [[Eastern Rumelia]]. In 1885, Plovdiv and Eastern Rumelia [[Bulgarian unification|joined]] Bulgaria.

There are many preserved ruins such as the ancient [[Plovdiv Roman theatre]], a Roman [[odeon (building)|odeon]], a [[Roman aqueduct]], the [[Plovdiv Roman Stadium]], the archaeological complex Eirene, and others. Plovdiv is host to a huge variety of cultural events such as the [[International Fair Plovdiv]], the international theatrical [[festival]] "A stage on a crossroad", the TV festival "The golden chest", and many more novel festivals, such as Night/Plovdiv in September, Kapana Fest, and Opera Open. The oldest American educational institution outside the [[United States]], the [[American College of Sofia]], was founded in Plovdiv in 1860 and later moved to Sofia.

====National revival====

Under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Filibe (as the city was known at that time) was a focal point for the Bulgarian national movement and survived as one of the major cultural centers for Bulgarian culture and tradition.

Filibe was described as consisting of Turks, Bulgarians, Hellenized Bulgarians, Armenians, Jews, Vlachs, Arvanites, Greeks, and Roma people. In the 16–17 century a significant number of [[Sephardic Jews]] settled along with a smaller Armenian community from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The [[Paulician]]s adopted Catholicism or lost their identity. The abolition of [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] as the language of the [[Archbishop of Ohrid|Bulgarian Church]] as well as the complete abolition of the church in 1767 and the introduction of the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet System]] led to ethnic division among people of different religions. Christian and Muslim Bulgarians were subjected to [[Hellenization]] and [[Turkification]] respectively. A major part of the inhabitants was fully or partly Hellenized due to the Greek patriarchate. The "Langeris" are described as Greeks from the area of the nearby [[Asenovgrad|Stenimachos]]. The process of Hellenization flourished until the 1830s but declined with the [[Tanzimat]] as the idea of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Hellenic nation]] of Christians grew and was associated with ethnic Greeks.

The re-establishment of the Bulgarian Church in 1870 was a sign of ethnic and national consciousness. Thus, although there is a little doubt about the Bulgarian origin of the Gulidas, the city could be considered of Greek or Bulgarian majority in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Detrez|first=Raymon|title=Relations between Greeks and Bulgarians: The Gudilas of Plovid|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, England|isbn=978-0-7546-0998-8|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1VpAAAAMAAJ&q=stanimaka|quote=deciding whether Plovdiv had a Bulgarian or a Greek majority depends on whether the Gudilas are considered as Bulgarians or Greeks|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529150559/https://books.google.com/books?id=s1VpAAAAMAAJ&q=stanimaka|url-status=live}}</ref> Raymond Detrez has suggested that when the Gudilas and Langeris claimed to be Greek it was more in the sense of "[[Byzantine Greels|Romei]] than Ellines, in a cultural rather than an ethnic sense".<ref name="balkanologie">[http://balkanologie.revues.org/2342 Graecomans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219171700/http://balkanologie.revues.org/2342 |date=19 February 2016 }}</ref> According to the statistics by the Bulgarian and Greek authors, there were no Turks in the city; according to an alternative estimate the city was of Turkish majority.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Roth|editor-first1=Ralf|editor-last2=Beachy|editor-first2=Robert|title=Who ran the cities?: city elites and urban power structures in Europe and North America, 1750–1940|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-7546-5153-6|pages=189–190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQzGUZasbQkC&q=plovdiv+muslim+majority&pg=PA189|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529150559/https://books.google.com/books?id=UQzGUZasbQkC&q=plovdiv+muslim+majority&pg=PA189|url-status=live}}</ref>

Filibe had an important role in the struggle for Church independence which was, according to some historians, a peaceful bourgeois revolution. Filibe became the center of that struggle with leaders such as [[Nayden Gerov]], Dr Valkovich, [[Joakim Gruev]], and whole families. In 1836 the first Bulgarian school was inaugurated, and in 1850, modern secular education began when the "St Cyrill and Methodius" school was opened. On 11 May 1858, the day of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] was celebrated for the first time; this later became a National holiday which is still celebrated today (but on 24 May due to Bulgaria's 1916 transition from the [[Old Style]] ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]) to the [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|New Style]] ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) calendar). In 1858 in the [[Church of the Holy Mother of God, Plovdiv|Church of Virgin Mary]], the Christmas liturgy was served for the first time in the [[Bulgarian language]] since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. Until 1906 there were Bulgarian and Greek bishops in the city. In 1868 the school expanded into the first grammar school. Some of the intellectuals, politicians, and spiritual leaders of the nation graduated that school.<ref name="pld"/>

The city was conquered by the Russians under [[Aleksandr Burago]] for several hours during the [[Battle of Philippopolis (1878)|Battle of Philippopolis]] on 17 January 1878.<ref name="pat"/> It was the capital of the [[Provisional Russian Administration in Bulgaria]] between May and October. According to the Russian census of the same year, Filibe had a population of 24,000 citizens, of which ethnic [[Bulgarians]] comprised 45.4%, [[Turkish people|Turks]] 23.1% and [[Greeks]] 19.9%.

===Eastern Rumelia===

According to the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on 3 March 1878, the Principality of Bulgaria included the lands with predominantly Bulgarian population. Plovdiv which was the biggest and most vibrant Bulgarian city was selected as a capital of the restored country and for a seat of the Temporary Russian Government.<ref name="ocertsi">Очерци из историята на Пловдив (стр. 80 – Космополитен град. Махали и квартали в ново време)</ref> Great Britain and [[Austria-Hungary]], however, did not approve that treaty and the final result of the war was concluded in the [[Congress of Berlin]] which divided the newly liberated country into several parts. It separated the autonomous region of [[Eastern Rumelia]] from Bulgaria, and Plovdiv became its capital. The Ottoman Empire created a constitution and appointed a governor.<ref>[http://www.mfa.bg/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=7915&Itemid=367 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, History and Geography]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220095752/http://www.omg.org/images/homepage/omg_banner3.gif Archived copy] at [[WebCite]] (20 April 2006).</ref>

In the spring of 1885, [[Zahari Stoyanov]] formed the Secret Bulgarian Central Revolutionary Committee in the city which actively conducted propaganda for the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. On 5 September, several hundred armed rebels from Golyamo Konare (now [[Saedinenie, Plovdiv Province|Saedinenie]]) marched to Plovdiv. In the night of 5–6 September, these men, led by Danail Nikolaev, took control of the city and removed from office the General-Governor [[Gavril Krastevich]]. A provisional government was formed led by [[Georgi Stranski]], and universal mobilization was announced.<ref>Аndreev, J. ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'' (''Balgarskite hanove i tsare'', ''Българските ханове и царе''), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 322 {{ISBN|954-427-216-X}}.</ref> After the Serbs were defeated in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]], Bulgaria and Turkey reached an agreement that the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia had a common government, Parliament, administration, and army. Today, 6 September is celebrated as the Unification Day and the Day of Plovdiv.

===Recent history===
After the unification, Plovdiv remained the second most populous city in Bulgaria after the capital [[Sofia]]. The first railway in the city was built in 1874 connecting it with the Ottoman capital, and in 1888, it was linked with Sofia. In 1892 Plovdiv became the host of the First Bulgarian Fair with international participation which was succeeded by the [[International Fair Plovdiv]]. After the liberation, the first brewery was inaugurated in the city.

The noteworthy English travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor visited Plovdiv in the late summer of 1934 and he was charmed by the town and a local woman name Nadjeda.<ref>Patrick Leigh Fermor, The Broken Road: From the Iron Gates to Mouth Athos (London: John Murray, 2013), pp. 15ff.</ref>

In the beginning of the 20th century, Plovdiv grew as a significant industrial and commercial center with well-developed light and food industry. In 1927 the electrification of Plovdiv has started. German, French, and [[Belgium|Belgian]] capital was invested in the city in the development of modern trade, banking, and industry. In 1939, there were 16,000 craftsmen and 17,000 workers in manufacturing factories, mainly for food and tobacco processing.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} During the Second World War, the tobacco industry expanded as well as the export of fruit and vegetables. In 1943, 1,500 Jews were saved from deportation in [[concentration camp]]s by the archbishop of Plovdiv, [[Patriarch Cyril of Bulgaria|Cyril]], who later became the Bulgarian Patriarch. In 1944, the city was bombed by the British-American coalition.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

On 6 April 1956, the first trolleybus line was opened and in the 1950s the Trimontsium Hotel was constructed. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a construction boom and many of the modern neighborhoods took shape. In the 1970s and 1980s, antique remains were excavated and the Old Town was fully restored. In 1990 the sports complex "Plovdiv" was finished. It included the largest stadium and rowing canal in the country. In that period, Plovdiv became the birthplace of Bulgaria's movement for democratic reform, which by 1989 had garnered enough support to enter government.

Plovdiv has hosted specialized exhibitions of the [[World's Fair]] in 1981, 1985, and 1991.

[[File:Plovdiv balkan-1-.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A view of Plovdiv with the [[Balkan Mountains|Stara Planina Mountain]] in the background.]]
Plovdiv is located on the banks of the [[Maritsa]] river, southeast of the Bulgarian capital [[Sofia]]. The city is in the southern part of the ''Plain of Plovdiv'', an [[alluvial plain]] that forms the western portion of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]]. From there, the peaks of the [[Sredna Gora]] mountain range rise to the northwest, the Chirpan Heights to the east, and the [[Rhodope mountains]] to the south.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=145 |language=bg |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ...|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Originally, Plovdiv's development occurred south of Maritsa, with expansion across the river taking place only within the last 100 years. Modern Plovdiv covers an area of {{convert|101|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, less than 0.1% of Bulgaria's total area. It is the most densely populated city in Bulgaria, with 3,769 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

Inside the city proper are six [[syenite]] hills. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were seven syenite hills, but one ([[Markovo tepe]]) was destroyed. Three of them are called the Three Hills ({{langx|bg|Трихълмие}} ''Trihalmie''), the others are called the Hill of the Youth ({{langx|bg|Младежки хълм}}, ''Mladezhki halm''), the Hill of the Liberators ({{langx|bg|Хълм на освободителите}}, ''Halm na osvoboditelite''), and the Hill of [[Hristo G.

In its ethnic character Plovdiv is the second or the third-largest cosmopolitan city inhabited by [[Bulgarians]], after [[Sofia]] and possibly [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]]. According to the 2001 census, out of a population of 338,224 inhabitants, the Bulgarians numbered 302,858 (90%). [[Stolipinovo]] in Plovdiv is the largest Roma neighbourhood in the [[Balkans]], having a population of around 20,000 alone; further Roma ghettos are [[Hadji Hassan Mahala]] and [[Sheker Mahala]]. Therefore, the census number is a deflation of the number of Roma people, and they are most likely the second-largest group after the Bulgarians, most of all because the Muslim Roma in Plovdiv claim to be of Turkish ethnicity and Turkish-speaking at the census ("[[Xoraxane]] Roma").<ref>[http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/facta/pas/pas99/pas99-09.pdf "The Relations of Ethnic and Confessional Consciousness of Roma in Bulgaria", Elena Marushiakova, Vesselin Popov]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> For further information see the article [[The Roma in Plovdiv|Roma people in Plovdiv]]. Like elsewhere in the country, Roma people are subjected to discrimination and segregation (See the Bulgaria section of the article [[Antiziganism]]).

After the Wars for National Union ([[Balkan Wars]] and World War I), the city became home for thousands of refugees from the former Bulgarian lands in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Western Thrace|Western]] and [[Eastern Thrace]]. Many of the old neighbourhoods are still referred to as ''Belomorski'', ''Vardarski''. Most of the Jews left the city after the foundation of [[Israel]] in 1948, as well as most of the Turks and Greeks. Prior to the population exchange, as of 1 January 1885, the city of Plovdiv had a population of 33,442, of which 16,752 were [[Bulgarians]] (50%), 7,144 [[Turkish people|Turks]] (21%), 5,497 [[Greeks]] (16%), 2,168 Jews (6%), 1,061 [[Armenians]] (3%), 151 [[Italians]], 112 [[Germans]], 112 [[Romani people]], 80 [[French people]], 61 [[Russians]] and 304 people of other nationalities.<ref name="histmuseum"/>

The vast majority of the inhabitants are Christians, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox]], Catholics, [[Eastern Catholic]]s, and Protestant trends ([[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventists]], [[Baptists]] and others). There are also some [[Muslims]] and Jews. In Plovdiv, there are many churches, two mosques and one synagogue (see [[Plovdiv Synagogue]]).

Some [[Aromanians]] also inhabit Plovdiv.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/IJSL.2006.029/pdf|title=The Aromânians: an ethnos and language with a 2000-year history|first=Nikolai|last=Kyurkchiev|journal=[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]|issue=179|pages=115–129|year=2006|doi=10.1515/IJSL.2006.029|s2cid=144939846}}</ref>

In 1969 the villages of [[Proslav]] and [[Komatevo]] were incorporated into the city. In 1987 the municipalities of Maritsa and Rodopi were separated from Plovdiv which remained their administrative center. In the last several years, the inhabitants from those villages had taken steps to rejoin the "urban" municipality.<ref>[http://news.plovdiv24.com/36695.html Темите на 2007–ма: Ягодово – квартал на Пловдив, Plovdiv24.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906180635/http://news.plovdiv24.com/36695.html |date=6 September 2008 }}, 3 February 2008 г.</ref>

The [[Plovdiv Roman theatre|Ancient theatre (Antichen teatur)]] is probably the best-known monument from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] in Bulgaria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purebulgaria.com/bg_version/cities.php?city_id=165 |title=Античен театър – Пловдив, информация за градове, региони, забележителности:: |publisher=PureBulgaria |date=9 April 2009 |access-date=8 July 2009 |archive-date=4 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704082650/http://www.purebulgaria.com/bg_version/cities.php?city_id=165 |url-status=live }}</ref> During recent archaeological survey, an inscription was found on a postament of a statue at the theatre. It revealed that the site was constructed at the 90s of the 1st century CE. The inscription itself refers to Titus Flavius Cotis, the ruler of the ancient city during the reign of Emperor Domitian.

The Ancient theatre is situated in the natural saddle between two of the Three Hills. It is divided into two parts with 14 rows each divided with a horizontal lane. The theatre could accommodate up to 7,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ideabg.com/clients/oldtown/en/mesta/antichen.php |title=The Ancient theatre |publisher=Ideabg.com |access-date=7 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017044044/http://ideabg.com/clients/oldtown/en/mesta/antichen.php |archive-date=17 October 2010  }}</ref> The three-story scene is on the southern part and is decorated with [[frieze]]s, cornices, and statues. The theatre was studied, conserved, and restored between 1968 and 1984. Many events are still held on the scene<ref>{{Cite book |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=140 |language=bg |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ...|display-authors=etal}}</ref> including the Opera Festival Opera Open, the Rock Festival Sounds of the Ages, and the International Folklore festival. The Roman Odeon was restored in 2004.<ref>[http://www.plovdivsite.hit.bg/index_files/Page1308.htm The Roman odeon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025224250/http://www.plovdivsite.hit.bg/index_files/Page1308.htm |date=25 October 2014 }}.</ref> It was built in the 2nd–5th centuries and is the second (and smaller) antique [[Odeon of Philippopolis|theatre of Philipopolis]] with 350 seats. It was initially built as a bulevterion, an edifice of the city council, and was later reconstructed as a theatre.

The [[Plovdiv Roman Stadium|Ancient Stadium]]<ref>[http://ancient-stadium-plovdiv.eu/?p=12&l=2 The Ancient stadium of Philippopolis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414210531/http://ancient-stadium-plovdiv.eu/?p=12&l=2 |date=14 April 2016 }}</ref> is another important monument of the ancient city. It was built in the 2nd century during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Hadrian]]. It is situated between Danov Hill and one of the Three Hills, beneath the main street from Dzhumaya Square to Kamenitsa Square. It was modelled after the stadium in [[Delphi]]. It was approximately {{convert|240|m|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|50|m|abbr=off}} wide, and could seat up to 30,000 spectators. The athletic games at the stadium were organised by the General Assembly of the province of Thrace. In their honour, the royal mint of Philippopolis coined money featuring the face of the ruling emperor as well as the types of athletic events held in the stadium. Only a small part of the northern section with 14 seat rows can be seen today; the larger part lies under the main street and a number of buildings.

[[Roman Forum (Plovdiv)|The Roman forum]] dates from the reign of [[Vespasian]] in the 1st century and was finished in the 2nd century. It is near the modern post office next to the Odeon. It has an area of 11 hectares and was surrounded by shops and public buildings. The forum was a focal point of the streets of the ancient city.<ref name="ppdv">{{Cite book |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=138 |language=bg |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ...|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

The [[Eirene Residence (Plovdiv)|Eirene Residence]] is in the southern part of the Three Hills on the northern part of an ancient street in the Archeological underpass. It includes remains of a public building from the 3rd–4th centuries which belonged to a noble citizen. Eirene is the Christian name for Penelopa, a maiden from Megadon, who was converted to Christianity in the 2nd century. There are colourful mosaics which have geometrical forms and figures.<ref>[https://archive.today/20141108121902/http://www.plovdivsite.hit.bg/index_files/Page910.htm Eirene Archaeological complex].</ref>

On [[Nebet Tepe|Nebet hill]] are the remains of the first settlement which in 12th century BCE grew to the [[Thrace|Thracian]] city of Eumolpias, one of the first cities in Southeastern Europe. Massive walls surrounding a temple and a palace have been excavated. The oldest part of the fortress was constructed from large syenite blocks, the so-called "cyclopean construction".

===Churches, mosques and temples===
There are a number of 19th-century churches, most of which follow the distinctive [[Eastern Orthodox]] construction style. They are the Saint Constantine and Saint Helena, the Saint Marina, the Saint Nedelya, the Saint Petka, and the Holy Mother of God Churches. As the city has been a gathering center for Orthodox Christians for a long period of time, Plovdiv is surrounded by several monasteries located at the foot of the Rhodope Mountains such as "St. George", "St. Kozma and Damian", St. Kirik, and Yulita (Ulita). They remain good examples of the late Middle Age Orthodox architecture and iconography masterpieces typical for the region. There are also Roman Catholic cathedrals in Plovdiv, the [[Cathedral of St Louis, Plovdiv|Cathedral of St Louis]] being the largest. There are several more modern Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and other Protestant churches, as well as older style [[Armenian Apostolic|Apostolic]] churches.

Two mosques remain in Plovdiv from the time of Ottoman rule. The [[Dzhumaya Mosque|Djumaya Mosque]] is considered the oldest European mosque outside Moorish Spain.

The [[Sephardic]] [[Plovdiv Synagogue]] is at Tsar Kaloyan Street 13 in the remnants of a small courtyard in what was once a large Jewish quarter. Dating to the 19th century, it is one of the best-preserved examples of the so-called "Ottoman-style" synagogues in the Balkans. According to author Ruth E. Gruber, the interior of the [[Plovdiv Synagogue]] is a "hidden treasure...a glorious, if run-down, burst of color." An exquisite Venetian glass chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, which has a richly painted dome. All surfaces are covered in elaborate, Moorish-style, geometric designs in once-bright greens and blues. Torah scrolls are kept in the gilded Aron-ha-Kodesh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritageabroad.gov/projects/bulgaria2.html |title=Synagogue of Plovdiv, Bulgaria |publisher=Heritageabroad.gov |date=5 October 2009 |access-date=14 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907192519/http://www.heritageabroad.gov/projects/bulgaria2.html |archive-date=7 September 2009  }}</ref>
