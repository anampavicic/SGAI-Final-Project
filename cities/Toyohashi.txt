==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

===Origins===
The area around present-day Toyohashi has been inhabited for many thousands of years.
Archaeologists have found human remains from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, which have been [[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to more than 10,000 BC along with the bones of [[Elephas naumanni|Naumann elephants]].

Numerous remains from the [[Jōmon period]], and especially from the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period]]s have also been found, including many [[kofun]] burial mounds.

During the [[Nara period]], the area was assigned to [[Atsumi District, Aichi|Atsumi]], [[Hoi District, Aichi|Hoi]] and [[Yana District, Aichi|Yana]] Districts of [[Mikawa Province]] and prospered during subsequent periods as a [[shukuba|post town]] on an important river crossing of the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] connecting the capital with the eastern provinces.

===Sengoku period===
During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was a highly contested zone between the [[Imagawa clan]] based in [[Suruga Province]] and various local warlords, who built a number of [[Japanese castle|fortifications]] in the area, including [[Yoshida Castle]].
The rising power of the [[Matsudaira clan]] and its alliance with [[Oda Nobunaga]] eventually neutralized the threat posed by the Imagawa, and the area became part of the holdings of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].
Following the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]] in 1590, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] ordered the [[Tokugawa clan]] to relocate to the [[Kantō region]] and assigned the castle to [[Ikeda Terumasa]]. Ikeda developed the surrounding [[castle town]] and embarked on a massive and ambitious plan to rebuild Yoshida Castle. However, following the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], he was relocated to [[Himeji Castle]].

===Edo period===
After the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Yoshida Castle became the center of [[Yoshida Domain]], a [[han (Japan)|clan fief]]. The domain was assigned to several different ''[[fudai]] [[daimyō]]'' clans until coming into the possession of the [[Matsudaira clan|Matsudaira (Nagasawa-Ōkōchi) clan]] in 1752, which remained in residence at Yoshida until the [[Meiji Restoration]]. 
The final ''daimyō'' of Yoshida, [[Matsudaira Nobuhisa]], surrendered the domain to the [[Meiji government]] in 1868. In 1869, the name of the domain was formally changed from Yoshida to Toyohashi.

===Meiji period===
With the establishment of the modern municipalities system under the [[Meiji government]] in 1879, Toyohashi Town was created within Atsumi District, [[Aichi Prefecture]]. Toyohashi Zoo was established in 1899.
The town achieved city status in 1906.

===Taishō period===
A tram system (the present-day Toyohashi Railway Asumadai Main Line) was established in 1925.

===Shōwa period===
In 1932, Toyohashi expanded its borders by annexing Shimoji Town (Hoi District), Takashi Village, Muroyoshida Village (Atsumi District), and Shimokawa Village (Yana District).
Toyohashi suffered considerable damage during the [[1944 Tōnankai earthquake]], and even more damage during the [[Toyohashi Air Raid]], which destroyed more than 60% of the city in June 1945.

===Modern Toyohashi===
In 1955, Toyohashi's geographic extent was expanded again with the annexation of neighboring Maeshiba Village (Hoi District), Futagawa Village, Takatoyo Village, Oitsu Village (Atsumi District) and Ishimaki Village (Yana District). Toyohashi achieved [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] status in 1999 with increased autonomy from the prefectural government.
