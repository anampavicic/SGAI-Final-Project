'''Shakhty''' ({{lang-rus|Шахты|p=ˈʂaxtɨ}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Rostov Oblast]], [[Russia]], located on the southeastern spur of the Donetsk mountain ridge, {{convert|75|km|sp=us}} northeast of [[Rostov-on-Don]]. As of the [https://www.donland.ru/activity/48/ 2023 Census], its population was&nbsp;222,500.<ref>{{Cite web |title=population 2023 |url=https://www.donland.ru/activity/48/}}</ref>{{Historical populations|1897|16000|1926|49000|1939|135000|1959|196190|1970|205307|1979|209495|1989|225797|2002|222592|2010|239987|2021|226452|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

It was previously known as ''Alexandro-Grushevskaya'' (until 1867),<ref name="Pospelov" /> ''Gornoye Grushevskoye Poseleniye'' (until 1881),<ref name="Pospelov" /> ''Alexandrovsk-Grushevsky'' (until 1920).<ref name="Pospelov" />

==History==
In the beginning of the 19th century<ref name="Pospelov">Pospelov, p.&nbsp;26</ref> sergeant-major Popov founded{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} on the [[Grushevka River]] a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] ''[[stanitsa]]'' of '''Alexandro-Grushevskaya''' ({{lang|ru|Александро-Грушевская}}).<ref name="Pospelov" /> While the exact reasoning behind this name is unclear, it is possible that the name was given in honor of Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]].<ref name="Pospelov" /> Twelve [[Cossacks]] and fourteen peasant serfs lived in the ''stanitsa'' at that time.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} By the mid-19th century, fifty-seven coal mines operated in this area.<ref name="Pospelov" /> In 1867, it was granted town status and renamed '''Gornoye Grushevskoye Poseleniye''' ({{lang|ru|Горное Грушевское Поселение}}).<ref name="Pospelov" /> The name was changed to '''Alexandrovsk-Grushevsky''' ({{lang|ru|Александровск-Грушевский}}) in 1881.<ref name="Pospelov" />

By 1914, the population had reached 54,000. The main source of income was [[coal mining]], which had been carried out in that region since the end of the 18th century. The population was poor, but the town had rail, telegraph and telephone networks, electricity and plumbing as well as libraries, hospitals and a post office. 1917 saw the city change hands three times, until it was taken on April&nbsp;28, 1919, by the [[Don Army]], under General {{ill|Aleksandr Fitskhelaurov|ru|Фицхелауров, Александр Петрович}}. For twenty months it was independent of the [[Bolsheviks]], but was ravaged by [[typhoid]].

In 1920, the city was given its present name.<ref name="Pospelov" /> The name, which literally means ''mines'' in Russian, was chosen due to the strong association with coal mining.<ref name="Pospelov" /> In 1920–24 Shakhty was part of [[Donetsk Governorate]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. During the 1920s, many of the churches and the archives were destroyed. In 1928, the city was the location of the [[Shakhty Trial]], a precursor of the [[show trial]]s of the 1930s.

In 1941, an independent Cossack republic had been declared in Shakhty although this was suppressed by the NKVD before the Russian invasion.<ref>p.88, Stalingrad, Antony Beevor</ref> In July 22,  1942, during the [[Great Patriotic War]], the city was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]; many coal pits and buildings were blown up by the Germans during their retreat in February 12, 1943. Twenty-nine of the townsmen were awarded the title of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].

In 1948, production levels in the mines reached what they had been before the war. During the [[Leonid Brezhnev]] years, the city was at the height of its development, with a population of over 250,000, and about ten million tons of coal being mined each year.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the city was the scene of many of [[Andrei Chikatilo]]'s murders.

[[Perestroika]] proved devastating for the city, as mines were privatized and shut down, causing massive unemployment, which led to a severe rise in crime and drug abuse. Today's Shakhty is the main industrial center of the Eastern [[Donbas]]. The city is also one of the main producers and exporters of tile in Eastern Europe.
