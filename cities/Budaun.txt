According to the [[Archaeological Survey of India|ASI]], these remains belong to the post-[[Gupta Period|Gupta period]] (7th-8th century).

The first authentic historical event connected with it, however, was its capture by Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1196, after which it became a very important post on the northern frontier of the [[Delhi]] empire. In 1223, a [[mosque]] of imposing size, crowned with a dome, was built. In the 13th century two of its governors, Shams-ud-din Iltutmish, the builder of the mosque referred above, and his son [[Rukn ud din Firuz]], attained the imperial throne. In 1571 the town was burnt, and about a hundred years later, under [[Shah Jahan]], the seat of the governorship was transferred to Sahaspur-Bilari. Budaun and its district was ceded to the British government in 1801 by the [[Nawab]] of [[Oudh]].<ref name=eb/>

In 1911, Budaun was a town and district of [[British Raj|British]] India, in the [[Rohilkhand]] division of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]]. At the time, an American Methodist mission maintained several girls’ schools and a high school for boys.<ref name=eb/>
