'''Pandi''' {{IPA|tl|pɐnˈde|}}, officially the '''Municipality of Pandi''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Pandi}}),  is a 2nd class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 155,115 people.{{PH census|current}}

The municipality of Pandi lies {{convert|41|km}} north-east of [[Manila]] and is located at the eastern portion of [[Bulacan Province]]. With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], Pandi is now included in the [[Greater Manila Area|Greater Manila]]'s built-up area which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan]] at its northernmost part.

Pandi is one of the youngest towns in Bulacan. During the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish Regime]], Pandi was a part of the political jurisdiction of the town of [[Meycauayan City]] including the towns of [[San Jose del Monte]], [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]], [[Marilao, Bulacan|Marilao]], [[Valenzuela City|Valenzuela]], [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]], [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]], it also formed part of the vast [[Hacienda]] [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]] de Pandi, which included the towns of [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]] and [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]] and parts of [[Angat, Bulacan|Angat]] and [[Bustos, Bulacan|Bustos]]. Pandi was then a part of the town [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]] (then Bigaa) until its formal separation and independence on April 17, 1946.

==History==

===Early history===

Pandi was originally part of Hacienda of Dominicans named Hacienda which belongs to the Town Santa Maria de Pandi (now Santa Maria, Bulacan); Pandi was derived from [[:wikt:pande#Kapampangan|''pande'']], [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] word of "blacksmith," cognate of Tagalog word "[[:wikt:panday|panday]]." In 1874 it was turn over to the town of Bigaa as one of its Barrio and the religious activity belongs to Convento de Bigaa under the auspices of Augustinian order established a chapel under the advocacy of Immaculate Concepcion.

===Spanish colonial era===
====The Republic of Kakarong de Sili====
{{Main|Battle of Kakarong de Sili}}
[[File:Kakarongjf.JPG|thumb|Inang Filipina Shrine]]
During the [[Philippine Revolution]], Pandi played a vital and historical role in the fight for Philippine independence, Pandi is historically known for the Real de Kakarong de Sili Shrine - ''Inang Filipina Shrine'', the site where the bloodiest revolution in Bulacan took place, where more than 3,000 [[Katipunan|Katipunero]] revolutionaries died. Likewise, it is on this site where the 'Republic of Real de Kakarong de Sili' of 1896, one of the first Philippine [[revolutionary republics]] was established. It was in Kakarong de Sili, which about 6,000 Katipuneros from various towns of Bulacan headed by Brigadier General Eusebio Roque, a mysticist (albolaryo) better known as "Maestrong Sebio or Dimabungo"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&q=dimabungo Halili 2004, p. 145].</ref> - [[List of Filipino Generals in the Philippine Revolution of 1896 and the Filipino-American War of 1899]] that the [[Kakarong Republic]] was organized shortly after the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin]] referred to as 'The Cry of Balintawak' - [[Andres Bonifacio]] a Filipino nationalist and revolutionalist who led in 'The Cry of Balintawak'. The 'Kakarong Republic' was the first revolutionary government established in Bulacan to overthrow the Spaniards. These significant event shave been included as of one of the attributes in the seal of the province of Bulacan.

According to available records including the biography of General [[Gregorio del Pilar]] entitled "Life and Death of a Boy General" written by [[Teodoro Kalaw]], former director of the [[National Library of the Philippines]], an improvised fort was constructed at 'Kakarong de Sili'. It had streets, an independent police force, a band, a factory of falconets, bolos and repair shops for rifles and cartridges. The 'Kakarong Republic' had a complete set of officials with [[Canuto Villanueva]] as Supreme Chief and 'Maestrong Sebio'- [[Eusebio Roque]], who was Brigadier General. The fort was attacked and totally destroyed on January 1, 1897, by a large Spanish force headed by ''General [[José Olaguer Feliú|Olaguer-Feliu]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&q=olaguer Halili 2004, p. 145-146].</ref> Gen. Gregorio del Pilar was only a lieutenant at that time and 'The Battle of Kakarong de Sili' was his first "baptism of fire". This was where he was first wounded and escaped to nearby barangay 'Manatal'. After the Battle of Kakarong de Sili mysticist Eusebio Roque were arrested and transferred to Bulakan town where the seat of Alcaldia Mayor located and he was sentenced to death.

The Kakarong Lodge No. 168 of the 'Legionarios del Trabajo' in memory of the 1,200 Katipuneros who perished in the battle erected a monument of the Inang Filipina Shrine - ''Mother Philippines Shrine'' in 1924 in the barrio of Kakarong. The actual site of the 'Battle of Kakarong de Sili' belongs to the administrative and geographical jurisdiction of Town of Bigaa and it was given to Pandi in 1946. The site is now a part of the barangay of 'Real de Kakarong'. No less than one of the greatest generals in the Philippines' history, General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] who became first Philippine president visited this sacred ground in the late fifties.

===The birth of the town of Pandi===

The independence of Pandi as a new town of [[Bulacan province|Bulacan]] was through the efforts of [[Mamerto Carpio Bernardo]] - (The Father of Pandi, Bulacan). During his term as mayor of [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]], he worked for the independence of Pandi as a town. [[Matias B. Salvador]] become the first mayor after the town gained independence in 1946 from its mother town [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]] formerly named Bigaa, under the Presidential Decree of President [[Sergio Osmeña]] the 4th president of the country.

==Geography==

Pandi is located at the center of four adjoining towns of Bulacan Province: [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]]; [[Bustos, Bulacan|Bustos]]; [[Angat, Bulacan|Angat]]; and [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]]. The land area are mostly rice fields devoted for planting crops and agriculture. Some barrios of the town are covered by irrigation system coming from [[Angat Dam]] on the [[Angat River]]. There are many little rivers that branch out from this river that become [[estuaries]]. Some little rivers provide livelihood by fanning gold. The biggest river is Bunsuran River that empties itself to the [[Philippine Sea]]. Along the side of the rivers are banana plantations thriving naturally and many taro plants.

Pandi is rich in many natural brooks coming from the mainland itself. In some remote areas the lands are still covered by bamboo trees that naturally thrive and multiplies. Some lands privately owned have mango plantations. In some areas that are privately owned are rock deposits being used for housing materials. The eastern area of Poblacion is gifted by the natural panoramic beauty of the scenery of [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre Mountains]] in [[Luzon]]. Owing to this the morning climate is always cloudy and cool in some areas of the town proper of Pandi, Bulacan. Some of the natural variations in topography of Pandi land areas have been evened out due to the urbanization of the town. The town's central area has been altered substantially by commercial establishments.
Pandi was part of 2nd congressional district from 1987 to 2022. It was moved to 5th district along with Balagtas, Bocaue, and Guiguinto.
