== Etymology ==

Kampala originally referred to only the present-day [[Old Kampala]] hill, on whose summit Fort Lugard was located, and the initial headquarters of the British colonial authorities in the soon to be [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Visit Kampala, Uganda |url=https://visitafrica.site/kampala.html |website=Visit Africa |access-date=January 9, 2024 |archive-date=9 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240109172605/https://visitafrica.site/kampala.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Before the British construction of Fort Lugard, the hill was a hunting reserve of the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] (King) of [[Buganda Kingdom|Buganda]] and had several species of antelope, especially the [[impala]]. As a result, when the British colonial officials were allocated this hill by the then Kabaka of Buganda, they referred to it as "The Hill of the Impala".{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The Baganda, in whose territory this British settlement was located, then translated "Hill of the Impala" as Akasozi ke'Empala. This was then shortened to K'empala and finally Kampala. ''Kasozi'' means "hill", ''ke'' "of", and ''empala'' the plural of "impala". Hence the name "Kampala" came to refer to this initial British colonial settlement that would later on spread out from the occupied [[Old Kampala]] hill near the pre-existing [[Kibuga]] (capital) of the Buganda Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web

== History ==
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Uganda. Kampala. The city from Cathedral Hill LOC matpc.00324.jpg|thumb|left|Kampala, the city from Cathedral Hill in 1936.]]
This area of numerous hills and swamps that later become known as Kampala was part of the core of the highly centralised [[Buganda Kingdom]]. It was also the site of the shifting ''Kibuga'' (capital) of the different ''Bassekabaka'' (kings) of the Buganda Kingdom, with each ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]'' (king) upon coronation, or subsequently during their reign, setting up their ''Kibuga'' (capital) on a new and or different hill as they wished or desired.

===19th century===
The first written description of this ''Kibuga'' (capital) was by the explorer [[Sir Richard Burton]] in his book, ''The Lake Region of East Africa'', published in 1860. In the book, Burton, relying on the information collected by Snay Bin Amir, an Arab trader, described the ''Kibuga'' as:

{{Blockquote|text=…the settlement is not less than a [[day's journey]] in length, the buildings are of cane and rattan. The sultan's (Kabaka) palace is at least a mile long and the circular huts neatly arranged in a line are surrounded by a strong fence which has only four gates.}}

In 1862, when explorer [[John Speke]] arrived in Buganda, the ''Kibuga'' (capital) was at Bandabarogo, present-day [[Banda, Uganda|Banda Hill]], and the reigning ''Kabaka'' (King) was [[Mutesa I of Buganda|Mutesa&nbsp;I]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/journaldiscover02spekgoog/page/n280 | title=Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile| publisher=Harper| year=1864}}</ref>

In 1875, explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] reported the capital as being at present-day [[Lubaga]] Hill, where he met the same ''Kabaka'', {{nowrap|Mutesa I.}}
During this visit, Stanley wrote a letter that was published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', inviting missionaries to come to Buganda. He also described the ''Kibuga'' in his 1870s dispatches to ''[[The New York Herald]]'', thus:

{{Blockquote|text=As we approached the capital, the highway from Usavara [Busabala] increased in width from {{convert|20|ft|m|0|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us}} to {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us|round=5}}...Arrived at the capital I found the vast collection of huts crowning the eminence were the Royal Quarters, around which ran several palisades and circular courts, between which and the city was a circular road, ranging from {{convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us}} to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us|round=5}}  in width with gardens and huts...|source=Bennet, N.R. (ed.) ''Stanley's Dispatches to the New York Herald'', 1871–1872, 1874–1877, Boston, 1970.}}

In 1877, the first missionaries from the [[Church Mission Society]], who were of the Protestant faith, arrived from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and were allocated [[Namirembe Hill]]. Two years later, in 1879, the Catholic [[White Fathers]] also arrived, first settling at the present-day village of Kitebi near Lubaga; subsequently, they would be allocated [[Lubaga]] Hill. The arrival of these two missionary groups laid the ground for the religious wars of 1888 to 1892 between their new converts and forced the missionaries from [[Great Britain]] to then lobby for the British government to take over Buganda/Uganda as a protectorate.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

In 1890, [[Frederick Lugard]], an agent of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]], arrived in Buganda during the reign of [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Kabaka Mwanga&nbsp;II]], with whom he signed a treaty of protection by the British government over Buganda, and the ''Kibuga'' (capital) was located at [[Mengo, Uganda|Mengo]] Hill. [[Captain (British Army)|Captain]] Lugard would, later on, be allocated the Kampala hill that would soon be known as [[Old Kampala]], and on which he built a fort.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Monteith |first=William |date=11 December 2017 |title=Markets and monarchs: indigenous urbanism in postcolonial Kampala |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/2201473X.2017.1409402 |journal=Settler Colonial Studies |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=247–265 |doi=10.1080/2201473X.2017.1409402|s2cid=158135082 }}</ref>

In 1895, [[Mengo Senior School]], the first school offering Western education in Kampala, was opened by the [[Church Missionary Society]] at [[Namirembe hill]], where mostly the children of chiefs and pages of the royal palaces were students.

In 1897, Mwanga launched a rebellion but was defeated and was subsequently captured and [[exile]]d, in 1899, to [[the Seychelles]] alongside Omukama [[Kabalega]], and his 3-year-old son was made ''[[Kabaka]]'' by the combined forces of the European officers leading Nubian and Baganda [[Colonial troops|colonial soldiers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/1370466-1379638-14dfxax/index.html|title=The betrayal and capture of Mwanga and Kabalega|website=Daily Monitor|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> This state of affairs later culminated in the signing of the [[Buganda Agreement (1900)]] that formalised British colonial rule in Buganda.

Also in 1897, Kampala's first Western-style health facility, [[Mengo Hospital]], was opened on [[Namirembe]] hill by British doctor and missionary [[Albert Ruskin Cook|Sir Albert Ruskin Cook]]. In addition, Sir Albert Ruskin Cook would in 1913 found [[Mulago Hospital]], the current National Referral Hospital, at [[Mulago]] hill.

In 1899, the [[Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa]] founded [[Lubaga Hospital]] on [[Lubaga]] Hill.

===20th century===
In 1900, the regents of the infant ''[[Kabaka]]'' [[Daudi Cwa II of Buganda|Daudi Cwa II]] (who were [[Apolo Kagwa]], the ''[[Katikiro]]'' (Prime Minister) of Buganda, Stanislaus Mugwanya, the ''Mulamuzi'' (Chief Judge) of Buganda, and Zakaria Kisingiri, the ''Muwanika'' (Chief Treasurer) of Buganda, with [[Bishop]] [[Alfred Tucker]]), signed the [[Buganda Agreement]] on behalf of Buganda with [[Sir Harry Johnston]], who signed on behalf of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/1370466-1387958-14e15y2/index.html|title=The great Buganda land grab of 1900|website=Daily Monitor|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Townsmen In The Making, Kampala and its suburbs|last1=Gutkind|first1=P.C.W|last2=Southall|first2=A.W|publisher=East African Institute Of Social Research|year=1957|isbn=978-0013388883|location=Kampala|pages=4}}</ref> 
This agreement with Sir Harry Johnston created new land tenures such as freehold, [[the Crown|Crown]] land, and [[mailo]], and divided up and allocated the land in such a way that would come to define the development of Kampala.
 
The land in [[Buganda]]'s ''Kibuga'' (capital), including [[Mengo, Uganda|Mengo]] Hill and [[Makerere]] Hill, was allocated to the young ''[[Kabaka]]'', the Baganda colonial collaborators, etc., under mailo and freehold. The religious missions were also formally allocated land they were previously occupying. Thus, the Catholic [[White Fathers]] got [[Lubaga]] Hill, the Protestant [[Church Missionary Society]] got [[Namirembe]] Hill, the Muslims under Prince Nuhu Mbogo's leadership received [[Kibuli]] Hill, the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|British Catholic]] [[Saint Joseph's Missionary Society of Mill Hill|Mill Hill Missionaries]] received most of [[Nsambya]] Hill. The [[Uganda Protectorate]] government obtained land classified as Crown lands in the area such as [[Old Kampala]] Hill, [[Nakasero]] Hill, etc.

To legalise the above changes, the following laws and ordinances were subsequently passed: The Crown lands Ordinance of 1903, The Land Law of 1908, The Registration of Land Titles ordinance of 1922, and the Busulu and Envujo law of 1928.<ref>Mukwaya, A.B (1953).

In 1906, the Crown lands consisting of Old Kampala, Nakasero hills etc. and covering {{convert|567|ha|km2 acre}} was consolidated and gazetted as Kampala Township.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

In 1912, Kampala Township received its first land-use plan and had a European and Asian population of 2,850.<ref>Nyakwebara, C (2010). "Chronology of Planning in Kampala: Implications for Future Structure Planning". The Urban Planning Magazine. No. 1. pp. 3–6.</ref>

In 1922, Kampala's oldest university, [[Makerere University|Makerere]], was founded as the Uganda Technical College at the present Makerere Hill and initially offered carpentry, building construction, mechanics, arts, education, agriculture, and medicine.

In 1930, the first sewerage plan was prepared to target a population of 20,000 people in the [[Nakasero]] and [[Old Kampala]] areas of the Kampala township. This plan guided sewerage development from 1936 to 1940 in planned urban areas of the Kampala Township and excluded the ''Kibuga'' area occupied by the [[Baganda]] and other natives.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Nilsson | first=David | title=A heritage of unsustainability?

In 1938, The East African Power & Lighting Company was granted a licence for thermal electric power generation and distribution for the towns of Kampala and [[Entebbe]], and in the same year [[Philip Mitchell (colonial administrator)|Sir Philip Mitchel]], the [[Governor of Uganda]], switched on Kampala and Uganda's first electric [[street lights]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gore|first=Christopher D.|title=Electricity in Africa: The Politics of Transformation in Uganda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bM4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34|year=2017|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-1-84701-168-8|page=34}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Mugabe | first=Faustin | title=110 years of electricity in Uganda | website=Daily Monitor | date=2018-04-20 | url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/110-years-electricity-Uganda/688342-4491242-pdxww5z/index.html | access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>

In 1945, [[Ernst May]], a German architect, was commissioned by the [[Uganda Protectorate]] Government to design a new physical plan for Kampala. Ernst May's plan of 1947 was intended to extend Kampala eastwards covering [[Kololo]] Hill and [[Naguru, Uganda|Naguru]] Hill, and with the commercial centre on the southern slopes of [[Nakasero]] Hill, an industrial zone in the southeast of Kampala, and, for the first time, a planned residential zone for the Ugandan natives.<ref name="auto1">{{cite book|last1=Pinther|first1=Kerstin|last2=Förster|first2=Larissa|last3=Hanussek|first3=Christian|title=Afropolis: City Media Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lcn62brtGQC&pg=PA59|year=2012|publisher=Jacana Media|isbn=978-1-4314-0325-7|page=59}}</ref> The plan was never fully implemented, and in 1951 the third physical plan by [[Henry Kendall (urban planner)|Henry Kendall]] was instead adopted, though it incorporated some elements of Ernst May's 1947 plan.<ref name="Folkers, Antoni S. 2019 p. 61">Folkers, Antoni S. et al.

Henry Kendall's 1951 plan expanded Kampala from the {{convert|5.67|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}} area of the 1930 plan to an area of {{convert|28|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}} incorporating areas like [[Kololo]] Hill, and the Industrial Area. However, like the first two planning schemes, the 1951 plan failed to achieve many of its stated objectives.<ref name="Folkers, Antoni S. 2019 p. 61"/>

On 9 October 1962, [[Uganda]] gained independence; subsequently the capital city was transferred from [[Entebbe]] to Kampala and in the same year, Kampala was granted [[city status]].

In 1968, six years after Uganda attained independence, the boundaries of Kampala were expanded incorporating the ''Kibuga'' (then known as Mengo Municipality), Kawempe and Nakawa Townships, and areas including Muyenga and Ggaba.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite book|url=http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/kampala.pdf|title=Situation Analysis of Informal Settlements in Kampala|publisher=United Nations Human Settlements Programme|year=2007}}</ref> This increased the administrative area of Kampala from {{convert|28|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}} to the current {{convert|189|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}}.

In 1972, the fourth physical plan for Kampala was made covering the newly incorporated areas of Kampala's boundary extensions of 1968, but the subsequent political and economic turmoil of the 1970s and 1980s meant the plan was never implemented.<ref name="auto2" /><ref>{{Cite conference|last1=Omolo-Okalebo|first1=Fredrick|last2=Sengendo|first2=Hannington|date=Jan–Feb 2011|title=Perspectives on City Planning of Post Independence Kampala: The Emergence of the Metropolitan Growth Model and the Hexagonal Cell|url=https://news.mak.ac.ug/documents/Makfiles/aet2011/Omolo.pdf|conference=Second International Conference on Advances in Engineering and Technology|pages=64–71|access-date=2019-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210143645/http://news.mak.ac.ug/documents/Makfiles/aet2011/Omolo.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Kampala]] during the [[Ugandan Bush War]] occurred in January 1986. It resulted in the capture of the city by the [[National Resistance Movement]], led by [[Yoweri Museveni]] and the subsequent surrender of the [[Ugandan government]].

Similarly, the fifth physical plan for Kampala, made in 1994, like the 1972 plan, was also never implemented.<ref>{{Cite thesis |title=Participatory physical planning in Uganda: investigation on public participation processes during the preperation of the 1994 Kampala structure plan |url=http://makir.mak.ac.ug/handle/10570/4029 |publisher=Makerere University |date=June 2012 |degree=Thesis |language=en |first=Miriam |last=Lawino}}</ref>

===21st century===
In 2010, the [[Kampala Capital City Authority]] Act was enacted, giving the Ugandan Government more control of the administration of Kampala. The act also created the Kampala Metropolitan Physical Planning Authority with the stated aims of improving the infrastructure of the City of Kampala and the surrounding districts of [[Wakiso District|Wakiso]], [[Mukono District|Mukono]], [[Buikwe District|Buikwe]], [[Mpigi District|Mpigi]] and [[Luweero District|Luwero]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Kampala Capital City Act, 2010 | website=Uganda Legal Information Institute | date=2010-12-28 | url=https://ulii.org/ug/legislation/act/2015/1-8 | access-date=2019-08-27 | archive-date=2019-08-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823201202/https://ulii.org/ug/legislation/act/2015/1-8 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:KAMPALA.LAKE VICTORIA.1 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Victoria]]]]

=== Topography ===
[[File:Apartment block in kololo Kampala.jpg|thumb|left|Apartment block in Kololo]]
The City of Kampala covers a total area of {{convert|189|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}}, comprising {{convert|176|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}} of land and {{convert|13|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}} of water.

Kampala is a hilly place with its valleys filled with sluggish rivers/ swamps. The highest point in the city proper is the summit of [[Kololo]] hill at {{convert|1311|m|ft}}, located in the center of the city and the lowest point at the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] south of the city center at altitude of {{convert|1135|m|ft}}.

==== Hills ====
[[File:Kampala Kasubi Tombs.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kasubi Tombs]]]]
Kampala was originally [[List of cities claimed to be built on seven hills|built on seven hills]], but it has expanded to cover more than the original seven hills.

The original seven hills are:

* [[Old Kampala]] Hill on which Fort Lugard was located, the first seat of the British colonial authorities in colonial Uganda.
* The second is [[Mengo, Uganda|Mengo Hill]] which was the then Kibuga (capital) of Buganda kingdom at the start of British colonial rule.
* The third is [[Kibuli]] Hill, that is home to the [[Kibuli Mosque]].
* The fourth is [[Namirembe]] Hill, that was home to the Anglican (Wangeleza) faction of the Buganda religious wars of 1888 to 1892 and site of Namirembe [[Anglican]] [[Cathedral]].
* The fifth is [[Lubaga]] Hill, that was home to the White Fathers Catholic (Wafaransa) faction of the above-mentioned Buganda religious wars and also site of the Rubaga Catholic Cathedral.
* The sixth is [[Nsambya]] Hill, site of the former Cathedral of St Peter's Nsambya and allocated to the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|British Catholic]] Mill Hill Mission during the signing of the Uganda Agreement (1900).
* The seventh is [[Nakasero]] Hill on whose summit was Fort Nakasero, a British military installation built after relocating from Fort Lugard in Old Kampala. The hill was also the site of the European Hospital (the current government analytical laboratory opposite Ministry of Public Service headquarters).

==== Swamps and slow rivers ====
Due to Kampala's hilly nature and tropical climate, the valleys have slow rivers/swamps that tend to flow southwards towards [[Lake Victoria]] or northwards. These seasonal and or permanent swamps cover 15% of Kampala's land area. They include:
* Kinawataka swamp river covering an area of {{convert|1.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}}  flowing southwards into [[Lake Victoria]] and is located in [[Nakawa Division]].<ref name="Gumm">{{Cite journal|last=Gumm|first=Emily|date=2011-04-01|title=The Use and Misuse of Wetlands in Kampala|url=https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/1022|journal=Independent Study Project (ISP) Collection}}</ref>

=== Vegetation ===
Kampala, due to the diversity of habitats that include [[wetland]]s and hills, was previously covered with short grasses on the tops of the hills, elephant grass (''Pennisetum purpureum'' Schumach.), ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'', African water lily etc. in the swamps and evergreen forests with trees such as [[Canarium schweinfurthii|African olive (mpafu)]] and [[Ficus natalensis|Natal fig (mutuba)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=A.

=== Climate ===
Kampala has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af'') under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]].<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web | access-date=2019-08-27 | url=https://en.climate-data.org/africa/uganda/central-region/kampala-5578/ | title=Kampala Climate | website=Climate-Data.org}}</ref>

A facet of Kampala's weather is that it features two annual [[wet season|wetter seasons]]. While the city does not have a true [[dry season]] month, it experiences heavier precipitation from August to December and from February to June.  However, it is between February and June that Kampala sees substantially heavier rainfall per month, with April typically seeing the heaviest amount of precipitation at an average of around {{convert|169|mm|in}} of rain.

Kampala, being the capital city and economic engine of Uganda, has a diverse ethnic population drawn from all parts of the country and also from neighboring countries such as [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Sudan]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], and even from countries as far away as India and China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Markets/10-000-Chinese-migrants-Uganda-illegally/688606-3810216-tog18lz/index.html |title=More than 10,000 Chinese migrants in Uganda illegally|date=2 January 2021 |orig-date=February 12, 2017 |website=Monitor |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928120829/https://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Markets/10-000-Chinese-migrants-Uganda-illegally/688606-3810216-tog18lz/index.html |archive-date= Sep 28, 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immigration.go.ug/media/press-statement-28-suspected-illegal-immigrants-arrested |website=Ministry of Internal Affairs |title=Press Statement: 28 Suspected Illegal Immigrants Arrested |date=25 July 2016 |access-date=17 September 2019 |archive-date=8 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408003720/https://www.immigration.go.ug/media/press-statement-28-suspected-illegal-immigrants-arrested |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/Why-Somalis-feel-at-home-in-Kisenyi-slum-Uganda/434746-2522790-rixv60z/index.html |title=Kisenyi slum: The Little Mogadishu of Kampala|date=6 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kcca.go.ug/media/docs/Kampala%20Urban%20Refugees%20And%20Host%20Community%20Needs%20Report.pdf|title=UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF URBAN REFUGEES AND HOST COMMUNITIES RESIDING IN VULNERABLE NEIGHBORHOODS OF KAMPALA|access-date=2023-08-19}}</ref>

Cross-cultural intimate relations in Kampala and even Uganda as a whole is still unusual. Although many of Kampala's residents live and work in close contact, they still define themselves by their ethnic origins. This is more evident in the native languages (alongside [[Luganda]] and English) that are used at home, workplaces, and public spaces. In addition to the [[Baganda]] and Banyankole, other large ethnic groups include the [[Basoga]], [[Kisoro|Bafumbira]], [[Toro Kingdom|Batoro]], [[Bakiga]], [[Alur people|Alur]], [[Bagisu]] (better known as Bamasaba), [[Banyoro]], [[Iteso]], [[Lango people|Langi]], and [[Acholi people|Acholi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/uganda/|title=Africa :: Uganda|date=21 August 2019|website=The World Factbook|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>

The informal sector is a large contributor to Kampala's GDP. Citizens who work in the formal sector also participate in informal activities to earn more income for their families. A public servant in Kampala, for example, may engage in agriculture in addition to working in the formal sector. Other informal fields include owning taxis and urban agriculture. The use of Kampala's wetlands for urban farming has increased over the past few decades. It connects the informal rural settlements with the more industrialized parts of the city. The produce grown in the wetlands is sold in markets in the urban areas.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Isunju | first1=John Bosco | last2=Orach | first2=Christopher Garimoi | last3=Kemp | first3=Jaco | title=Hazards and vulnerabilities among informal wetland communities in Kampala, Uganda | journal=Environment and Urbanization | publisher=SAGE Publications | volume=28 | issue=1 | date=2015-12-14 | issn=0956-2478 | doi=10.1177/0956247815613689 | pages=275–293| doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[Boda-boda]]s (local motorbike transport) are a popular mode of transport that gives access to many areas within and outside the city. Standard fees for these range from USh:1,000 to 2,000 or more.

In early 2007, it was announced that Kampala would remove commuter taxis from its streets and replace them with a comprehensive city bus service. (In Kampala, the term "taxi" refers to a 15-seater minibus used as public transport.) The bus service was expected to cover the greater Kampala metropolitan area including [[Mukono]], [[Mpigi]], [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]], [[Entebbe]], [[Wakiso]] and [[Gayaza]]. {{as of|December 2011}} the service had not yet started.<ref>{{cite news

At the start of 2018, there was a resurgence of car rental services in Kampala and are now a common means of transport. There are two kinds of car hire services, the metered (app) car hire where [[Uber]], safe car and bolt belong and the customary car rental services which include [https://www.carrentalinuganda.com/ Car Rental in Uganda], Road Trip Uganda, 4x4 Uganda, [https://www.selfdriveinuganda.com/ Self Drive in Uganda] and Alpha Rentals. With car hire in Kampala, a traveler can either a hire a car on a self-drive or car and driver basis to travel to any given destination in the city or outside it especially when using customary services.  The services are considered the safest and convenient means of travel in the capital of Uganda, but their drawback is they are quite expensive for the local person. Car Hire services have been labeled as a transport mode for tourists and people from an affluent background.
