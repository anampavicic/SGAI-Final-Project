==Etymology==
The appellation ''Silay'' is derived from the name of a native tree which grew abundantly in the area. The [[Cratoxylum sumatranum|kansilay]] is the city's official tree.

===The Legend of Princess Kansilay===
A local legend tells of how Silay City got its name. It is said that in the days of the [[datu]]s and [[rajah]]s, there once lived a princess named Kansilay. An attack on the settlement by pirates was thwarted when the princess bravely led the people in the village's defense. The fight was furious and the princess fought like a seasoned warrior. Murals that used to grace some of the city's public buildings depict her as a fierce fighter wielding a huge ''[[Bolo knife|talibong]]'', a short native single-edged sword. The pirates were routed, but at the cost of the princess' life. Her paramour arrived in time to see her die. In grief, the people lovingly buried her. To their surprise, a tree grew right over her grave, the first Kansilay tree, a final gift from the brave princess.

== History ==

=== Spanish colonization ===
Silay was first settled in 1565, under the name ''"Carobcob"'', which means "to scratch" in [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a]]; residents of the settlement relied upon harvesting ''tuway'' [[clam]]s, which involved "scratching" (or raking) the sands for the [[mollusk]]s at low tide, as a means of livelihood. In early writings, the settlement was also referred to as ''"Calubcub"'', ''"Caracol"'' and ''"Caraco"''.<ref>{{cite book | last =Sa-onoy | first =Modesto | author-link =Modesto P. Sa-onoy | title =Parroquia de San Diego | publisher =Today Printers and Publishers | year =2006 | page =1 }}</ref> The last two variations mean "snail" or a "spiral" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. ''Carobcob'' was built near the mouth of a [[Stream|creek]]; nothing is left of the village today. ''Carobcob'' was granted as an [[encomienda]] to Cristobal Nuñez Paroja, one of the seventeen soldiers of [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] on January 25, 1571.

In the second half of the century, [[Moro people|Moro]] slave raiders escalated their incursions on the large island, forcing the ''Corregidor'' of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]] to adopt the policy of flight rather than resistance. People left their homes sometime in 1760 and settled in a new location between two small rivers, Matagoy and Panaogao. A ''paloisades'' or ''estacada'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "palisade" or "stockade") was constructed to protect the populace from Moro raiders. The place is now known as Sitio Estaca, its name derived from the Spanish word ''estacada''.

In 1760, Silay was recognized as a town being referred to in a letter from Governor Juan Jose de Mijares (1772–1775) mentioning Silay as a leading town in the north. In 1776, the bishop of [[Cebu]] considered Silay as the center of the [[parish]].  In 1760, it became a ''pueblo'' or town. By 1896, it had become a leading sugar-producing area because of the ''Horno Economico'' ([[sugar mill]]) built in 1846 by a [[French people|Frenchman]] who became a permanent resident of Silay, [[Yves Leopold Germain Gaston]].

=== Negros Revolution ===
{{main|Negros Revolution}}
[[File:Balay Negrense.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Balay Negrense]] on Cinco de Noviembre Street]]
With the outbreak of the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution of 1896]] came a division between the [[sugarcane]] planters of Silay and the [[clergy]]. Some planters and clergy supported the rebels while others were against the revolution. On November 5, 1898, at about 2:00 in the afternoon, residents of Silay gathered in the street corner now known as ''Cinco de Noviembre'' Street and from there they proceeded to the Spanish garrison near the Catholic Church. The encounter was bloodless. The Spanish civil guard commander, Lt. Maximiano Correa, refused to surrender. After negotiations with the revolutionaries mediated by Juan Viaplana, a local Spaniard, the Spanish garrison did surrender. A [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised for the first time at the Silay plaza later that afternoon. [[Aniceto Lacson]] became president after the signing of the terms of surrender. Timoteo Unson and the group of Silay residents then marched south to join forces with some residents of [[Talisay, Negros Occidental|Talisay]] for an attack on [[Bacolod]], the capital.

=== World War II ===
On the slopes of [[Silay (volcano)|Mt. Silay]] lies Patag, the site of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]'s [[last stand]] in Negros during [[World War II]]. In 1945, [[United States military|U.S. military forces]] landed in the island. The occupying forces of the Nagano Detachment of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] retreated to Silay and proceeded up Mt. Silay to Patag. There, they established a defensive position. Military forces of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] and soldiers of the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 40th Infantry Division]] proceeded up the slopes of Mt. Silay with help from Filipino soldiers of the 7th, 72nd and 75th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Negrense guerrilla fighters and defeated the Japanese defenders. Today, the site is marked by a monument dedicated to the efforts which led to the liberation of the island of Negros.

=== Post-World War II ===
==== Cityhood ====
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On June 12, 1957, Silay was converted into a city, by virtue of Republic Act 1621.

==Culture==
[[File:Maria Ledesma Golez Heritage House Front view.jpg|thumb|left|Golez Heritage House|229x229px]]
Silay City had been known in the past as the "Paris of Negros" and the "cultural and intellectual hub of Negros" due to the residents' love for knowledge and works of art, and its collection of heritage mansions built during the height of the Philippine sugar industry's success, of which Negros was the very center. Most notable among these houses is [[Balay Negrense]], the mansion of the son of the first Negrense sugar baron, [[Yves Leopold Germain Gaston]] and the [[Hofileña Ancestral House]] built by Manuel Severino Hofileña for his wife, former Miss Silay Gilda Ledesma Hojilla.

Silay became a chartered city on June 12, 1957, by virtue of Republic Act 1621.

On June 7, 2003, Silay City became the first local government unit in the Republic of the Philippines to hold a [[referendum]] through a [[People's Initiative]] approving the 2003 annual executive budget.

Today, Silay City is listed by the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] as one of its 25 tourist destinations in the Philippines. It is considered the seat of arts, culture and [[ecotourism]] in the [[Negros Island Region]].

=== Hugyaw Kansilay Festival ===
Every 12th day of June, the city celebrates their annual festival called ''Hugyaw Kansilay Festival.'' The theme is derived from the story of Kansilay, which is also the origin of the city's name. The festival reflects the growth of Silay; from a lowly [[Village|pueblo]] to a city that can hold its own among the country's best. The city's festival dance depicts the setting, characters, [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Subplot|sub-plots]], [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] and the story of the Legend of Kansilay.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/opinion/2016/06/04/pacete-kansilay-festival-dance-477556|title=Kansilay Festival Dance|date=June 4, 2016|work=Sunstar|author=Ver. F. Pacete}}</ref>
