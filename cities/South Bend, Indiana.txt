At the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], the city had a total of 103,453 residents and is the [[List of cities in Indiana|fourth-largest city in Indiana]]. Located just south of the border with [[Michigan]], South Bend anchors the [[Michiana]] region and is {{Convert|72|mi|km}} east of [[Downtown Chicago|downtown]] [[Chicago]]. The [[South Bend-Mishawaka metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] had a population of 324,501 in 2020, while its combined statistical area had 812,199.<ref>{{cite web |title=Table 2.

The St. Joseph River shaped South Bend's economy through the mid-20th century. River access assisted heavy industrial development such as that of the [[Studebaker|Studebaker Corporation]], the [[Oliver Corporation|Oliver Chilled Plow Company]], and other large corporations.

The population of South Bend declined after 1960, when it peaked at 132,445. This was chiefly due to migration to suburban areas as well as the demise of [[Studebaker]] and other [[heavy industry]]. Today, the largest industries in South Bend are health care, education, small business, and [[tourism]]. Remaining large corporations based in the area include [[Crowe Global|Crowe]], [[Honeywell]], and [[AM General]]. The city's economy and culture are influenced by the nearby [[University of Notre Dame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nd.edu/visit/explore-south-bend/|title = Explore South Bend}}</ref>

==History==

===Early history===
The St. Joseph Valley was long occupied by Native Americans. One of the earliest known groups to occupy what would later become northern Indiana was the [[Miami tribe]]. Later, the [[Potawatomi]] moved into the region, utilizing the rich food and natural resources found along the river. The Potawatomi occupied this region of Indiana until most of them were forcibly removed in the 1840s. The South Bend area was popular because its portage was the shortest overland route from the St. Joseph River to the [[Kankakee River]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://historymuseumsb.org/early-st-joseph-county-history/ |title =Early St. Joseph County History |publisher = The History Museum |access-date = December 17, 2015}}</ref> This route was used for centuries, first by the Native Americans, then by French explorers, missionaries and traders.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://historymuseumsb.org/research-history/local-history/ |title =Local History |publisher =The History Museum|access-date = December 17, 2015}}</ref> The French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the first white European to set foot in what is now South Bend,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/South-Bend-History.html |title = South Bend: History – French Exploration Establishes South Bend |publisher = City-data.com |access-date = December 17, 2015}}</ref> used this portage between the St. Joseph River and the Kankakee River in December 1679.

===First settlements===
The first permanent white settlers of South Bend were fur traders who established trading posts in the area. In 1820, [[Pierre Frieschutz Navarre]] arrived, representing the [[American Fur Company]] (AFC) of [[John Jacob Astor]]. He settled near what is now downtown South Bend.<ref name=Crossroads>{{cite book |title = South Bend: Crossroads of Commerce |chapter = At The Bend In The River |last = Palmer|first=John |year = 2003 |publisher = Arcadia Publishing |isbn = 0-7385-2414-X }}</ref> [[Alexis Coquillard]], another agent of the AFC,<ref name=Crossroads /><ref name=StHistory>{{cite book |title = History of St. Joseph County, Indiana |chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/historyofstjosep01howa |chapter = Chapter XI The City of South Bend |last=Howard|first=Timothy E. |year = 1907 |publisher = The Lewis Publishing Company }}</ref> established a trading post known as the Big St. Joseph Station.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://historymuseumsb.org/the-first-settlers/ |title =The First Settlers |publisher = The History Museum |date = May 24, 1904 |access-date = December 17, 2015 }}</ref> In 1827, [[Lathrop Minor Taylor]] established a post for Samuel Hanna and Company, in whose records the name St. Joseph's, Indiana was used.<ref name=StHistory /> By 1829, the town was growing, with Coquillard and Taylor emerging as leaders. They applied for a post office. Taylor was appointed [[postmaster]], and the post office was designated as Southold, Allen County, Indiana.<ref name=Crossroads /> The following year, the name was changed to South Bend, probably to ease confusion, as several other communities were named Southold at the time.

In 1831, South Bend was laid out as the county seat and as one of the four original townships of [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|St. Joseph County]] with 128 residents.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://historymuseumsb.org/early-south-bend/ |title =Early South Bend |publisher = The History Museum |access-date = December 17, 2015 }}</ref> That same year, [[Horatio Chapin]] moved to the settlement, opened the first general store with imported (out of state) goods and helped established the first church and Sunday school.<ref name = Crossroads /> Around the same time, design began on what would become the town of South Bend. The town was formally established in 1835, with Chapin as the first president of the board of town trustees.<ref>J. Palmer, South Bend: Crossroads of Commerce (Charleston, SC, 2003), p. 56</ref> In 1856, attorney Andrew Anderson, Chapin's son-in-law, founded May Oberfell Lorber, the oldest continuous business in St. Joseph County.<ref>[http://www.maylorber.com/ May Oberfell Lorber] Official website</ref> He compiled a complete index of South Bend's real estate records.<ref>{{cite web |title = May, Oberfell & Lorfer |publisher = [[Indiana Historical Society]] |url = http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/may-oberfell-lorber.pdf |access-date = October 12, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120913122220/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/may-oberfell-lorber.pdf |archive-date = September 13, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

In 1841, [[Schuyler Colfax]] was appointed St. Joseph County deputy auditor. Colfax purchased the ''South Bend Free Press'' and then turned it into a pro-[[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] newspaper, the ''St. Joseph Valley Register''. He was a member of the state constitutional convention of 1850, at which he opposed the barring of African American migration to Indiana. He joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], like many Whigs of his day, and was elected to Congress in 1855, becoming Speaker of the House in 1863 during the administration of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. In 1868, he was elected vice president under [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Colfax returned to South Bend after his stint in Washington and is buried in City Cemetery, west of downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000626 |title=COLFAX, Schuyler – Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |access-date=December 17, 2015}}</ref>

===Early business===
During the late 1830s through the 1850s, much of South Bend's development centered on the industrial complex of factories located on the two [[Mill race|races]] (man-made canals along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in South Bend). Several dams were created and factories were built on each side of the river. On October 4, 1851, the first steam [[locomotive]] entered South Bend.<ref name=Crossroads /> This shifted commerce from the river to the [[railroad]]. In 1852, Henry Studebaker set up [[Studebaker]] wagon shop, later becoming the world's largest wagon builder and the only one to later succeed as an automobile manufacturer. The [[Singer Corporation|Singer Sewing Company]] and the [[Oliver Corporation|Oliver Chilled Plow Company]] were among other companies that made manufacturing the driving force in the South Bend economy until the mid-20th century.<ref name=Crossroads /> Another important economic act was the dredging of the [[Kankakee River]] in 1884 to create farmland.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thekankakeeriver.com/kankakeeDredging.html |title = Dredging Of The River |publisher = Thekankakeeriver.com |access-date = December 17, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160113204314/http://www.thekankakeeriver.com/kankakeeDredging.html |archive-date = January 13, 2016 |url-status = dead }}</ref> During this time period there was a great immigration of Europeans, such as Polish, Hungarian, Irish, German, Italian, and Swedish people to South Bend because of available employment in area factories.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Indiana_Emigration_and_Immigration |title = Indiana Emigration and Immigration &#124; Learn |publisher = FamilySearch.org |date = December 11, 2015 |access-date = December 17, 2015 }}</ref>

South Bend benefited from its location on the [[Michigan Road]], the main north–south artery of [[northern Indiana]] in the 19th century.<ref name = Crossroads /> Another significant development occurred near South Bend in 1842, when Father [[Edward Sorin]] founded the [[University of Notre Dame]] just north of the town.<ref name="ND">"[http://nd.edu/aboutnd/ About Notre Dame The University of Notre Dame]" Official website. Retrieved on November 13, 2007.</ref> It became a major factor in the area's economy and culture.<ref name="NDEcon">Bay Area Economics."[http://impact.nd.edu/PDF/UND_economic_impact_report_2002.pdf Notre Dame and The Local Economy:2002]."

===Establishment and early history===
South Bend was incorporated as a city on May 22, 1865, and its first elections were held on June 5, 1865, with William G. George elected as its first mayor<ref name="StHistory" /> The official city motto, "Peace", refers to the fact that incorporation came in the month following the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] surrender that effectively ended the [[American Civil War]].

Industrial growth was rapid after the Civil War, most notably with the [[Studebaker]] wagon factory, and the [[Oliver Farm Equipment Company|Oliver plow company]]. Good jobs and high wages attracted immigrants from Europe, especially Germans, Irish, and Poles. The majority were Catholic, and they achieved higher rates of social mobility than the same ethnic groups in the Northeast .<ref>Dean R, Esslinger, ''Immigrants and the city: Ethnicity and mobility in a nineteenth century Midwestern community'' (Kennikat Press, 1975).</ref>

Olivet African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church was founded in South Bend in March 1870, making it the first African American church in the city.<ref>{{cite web |title = A LOOK BACK: Blacks shape South Bend |url = http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/a-look-back-blacks-shape-south-bend/article_aa39d4e2-2fb7-5574-8d80-8023b145b2e7.html |website = South Bend Tribune |access-date = December 16, 2015 }}</ref> Olivet AME is still an active African Methodist Episcopal Church, and celebrated its 145th anniversary in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title = South Bend 150 history timeline |url = http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/south-bend-history-timeline/article_892b9131-779f-5506-8320-e472ba262a49.html |website = South Bend Tribune |access-date = December 16, 2015 }}</ref>

A sergeant from South Bend fired the first American shells against Germany in World War I.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Indiana Sergeant Fired First Shot |date = October 31, 1917 |journal = New York Times }}</ref>

====History with Ku Klux Klan====
In 1923, the African American owner of a soda fountain received a letter signed "KKK", threatening to kill an African American man held in the city's jail and harm the rest of the city's African American population. Within a few days, over a thousand African Americans fled the city.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Negroes Leave South Bend in Fear of Klan |date = September 12, 1923 |journal = Chicago Daily Tribune }}</ref>

In 1924, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] held a conference and planned a parade from its local headquarters at 230 S. Michigan St. In preparation, Klan members were posted around town to direct traffic. [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] students, well aware of the anti-Catholic nature of the Klan, vigorously protested this intrusion, and before noon all of the Klansmen traffic directors had been "unmasked and unrobed." Notre Dame students continued the fight, with several hundred gathering outside of the Klan headquarters, throwing rocks and smashing windows in protest. Local police as well as Notre Dame officials eventually managed to convince them to return to campus.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Indiana News |last = Smith |first = Alvin |date = May 24, 1924 |journal = Chicago Defender }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title = South Bend Bars Klan Parade After Disorder: Lodge Headquarters are Stormed |date = May 18, 1924 |journal = Chicago Daily Tribune }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title = Klan and Foes Fight in Indiana |date = May 20, 1924 |journal = Chicago Daily Tribune }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dame |first=Marketing Communications: Web {{!}} University of Notre |title=A Clash Over Catholicism |url=https://www.nd.edu/stories/a-clash-over-catholicism/ |access-date=2023-06-26 |website=A Clash Over Catholicism |language=en}}</ref> It is said that even legendary football coach [[Knute Rockne]] became involved in the struggle to calm down the students.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = N.D.

===Later business===
Other industries developed in South Bend in the early 20th century, including Birdsell Manufacturing Company, the [[Bendix Corporation]], [[Honeywell]], [[AlliedSignal]], [[South Bend Lathe Works]], the O'Brien Paint Corp., the South Bend Toy Company, South Bend Range, South Bend Bait Company, and [[South Bend Watch Company]].

==Economy==
[[File:Liberty-Tower-SB IMG 1486 7-17-2020.jpg|thumb|upright|25-story [[Liberty Tower (South Bend)|Liberty Tower]], the tallest building in South Bend]]
South Bend's location on the St. Joseph River led to an industrial-based economy in the late 19th century and early-to-mid-20th century. In 1923, industrialist and entrepreneur [[Vincent Hugo Bendix|Vincent H. Bendix]] selected South Bend as the site of his new manufacturing plant for automotive parts.<ref name="Hallett, Anthony 1997 p. 51">Hallett, Anthony & Diane, ''Vincent H. Bendix'', Encyclopedia of Entrepreneurs, John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-17536-6}} (1997) p. 51</ref> He chose South Bend primarily because it was on a rail line midway between Chicago and Detroit, the two automotive manufacturing centers of the United States at the time.<ref name="Hallett, Anthony 1997 p. 51" /> Eventually, the Bendix corporation built a vast manufacturing complex on its South Bend acreage served by the major railroads, including a huge shipping and receiving building where railroad cars could enter at one end, unload, and depart at the opposite end.

By the end of [[World War II]], manufacturing began to diminish.<ref name="industry">Historic South Bend"[http://www.monon.monon.org/sobend/main.html South Bend's Historical Heritage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823004448/http://www.monon.monon.org/sobend/main.html |date=August 23, 2006 }}."

Parts of the Bendix factory complex were later acquired and divided between [[Honeywell Corporation]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] Corporation, respectively. Honeywell Aerospace continues to manufacture aviation products at its former Bendix facility. In 2010, Bosch announced that it would cease all operations at its [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] plant location in South Bend by the end of 2011.<ref>''[http://articles.wsbt.com/2010-11-16/robert-bosch-corp_24835725 Bosch plant to close in South Bend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811211334/http://articles.wsbt.com/2010-11-16/robert-bosch-corp_24835725 |date=August 11, 2011 }}'', retrieved April 25, 2011</ref> Bosch vacated the building entirely in October 2012.

===Employers===
Since the 1960s, education, health care, and small business have come to the forefront of South Bend's economy, though the city has never regained the level of prosperity it enjoyed before that time.

Health care is another major contributor to the South Bend economy. In 2012, [[Memorial Health System]] announced that it was merging with Elkhart General Hospital, located in Elkhart County, to form Beacon Health System.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nwibq.com/health-care/beacon-new-name-for-elkhart-memorial-group/ |title = Beacon new name for Elkhart, Memorial group |publisher = NWIBQ.com |date = June 19, 2012 |access-date = December 17, 2015 }}</ref> Beacon is the largest employer in the city and in St. Joseph County, employing 7,088 people.<ref name="comprehensive" /> Other notable businesses include [[Honeywell]], Bosch, and [[PEI-Genesis.|PEI Genesis.]] [[AM General]], [[Crowe Horwath]], and [[Tire Rack]] all have corporate headquarters in South Bend.

South Bend is connected to state and national highway systems by [[Indiana State Road 2|State Roads 2]], [[Indiana State Road 23|23]], and [[Indiana State Road 933|933]]; [[U.S. Route 20 in Indiana|U.S. Route 20]] and [[U.S. Route 31 in Indiana|31]]; and [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 90 (Indiana)|90]], the [[Indiana Toll Road]]. The original routes of both the [[Lincoln Highway]] and the [[Dixie Highway]] also pass through South Bend. South Bend was also a town along the intrastate [[Michigan Road]].

Parts of Eddy Street, Sample Street, Chapin Avenue, Marion Street, and Madison Street form an incomplete loop around the downtown area; this was formerly referred to as "the innerbelt".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/515792723/|title=The South Bend Tribune from South Bend, Indiana on July 10, 1968 · 31|website=Newspapers.com|date=July 10, 1968 }}</ref> Portions of State Roads 23 and 933 follow this route.

For transportation around the South Bend metro area, there is the [[St. Joseph Valley Parkway]], designated in places as US 20, US 31, and [[Indiana State Road 331|State Road 331]], which bypasses South Bend to the south and west, and connects to Michigan to the north and the greater [[Elkhart, Indiana|Elkhart]] area to the east. The Indiana Toll Road (Interstates 80 and 90) passes through northern South Bend.

This more efficient system has helped to save the city an estimated $100&nbsp;million in new sewage pipes.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fastcompany.com/3014805/how-south-bend-indiana-saved-100-million-by-tracking-its-sewers |title = How South Bend, Indiana Saved $100 Million By Tracking Its Sewers |date = August 5, 2013 |website = Fastcompany.com |access-date = August 27, 2017 }}</ref>

===Law enforcement===
{{main | South Bend Police Department}}
The police force in South Bend has undergone many changes and expansions in its history, starting in 1831 when the first constables were appointed.

===Environmental initiatives===
In 2015, South Bend engaged in a partnership with the University of Notre Dame to revitalize the Bowman Creek ecosystem. Bowman Creek is a tributary of the St. Joseph River in South Bend that has suffered from contamination. The Bowman Creek initiative included partners from local high schools, colleges, and business leaders focused on improvements to both the creek and the neighborhoods. The vision for the collaboration is to institute a unique water quality monitoring system, similar to South Bend's combined sewer overflow system.<ref>{{cite web |title = Smart cities think big with $160 million White House program |url = http://fortune.com/2015/09/16/smart-cities-160-million-white-house-program/ |website = Fortune |access-date = September 29, 2015 }}</ref>
