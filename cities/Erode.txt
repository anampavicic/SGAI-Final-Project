'''Erode''' ({{IPA-ta|iːɾoːɽɯ|lang}}; īrōṭu), is a city in the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is located on the banks of the [[River Kaveri|Kaveri river]] and is surrounded by the [[Western Ghats]]. Erode is the seventh largest [[List of urban agglomerations in Tamil Nadu|urban agglomeration in Tamil Nadu]]. It is the administrative capital of [[Erode district]] and is administered by the [[Erode Municipal Corporation]] which was established in 2008.

The [[Kongu Nadu|region]] was ruled by the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]] during the [[Sangam period]] between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE. The [[medieval Cholas]] conquered the region in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century followed by the [[Madurai Nayaks|Nayaks]] who introduced the [[Polygar|Palayakkarar system]]. In the later part of the 18th century, the it came under the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and following the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]], the [[British East India Company]] annexed it to the [[Madras Presidency]] in 1799. The region played a prominent role in the second [[Poligar War]] (1801) when it was the area of operations of [[Dheeran Chinnamalai]].

Post [[Independence of India|Indian Independence]] in 1947, Erode was part of [[Coimbatore district]]. It was established as the capital of the newly formed Erode district in 1979. Erode is a part of [[Erode (Lok Sabha constituency)|Erode Lok Sabha constituency]] that elects its [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|member of parliament]]. Erode is a major agricultural, industrial and educational hub. Erode is among the largest producers of [[turmeric]] and [[Erode Turmeric]] is recognized as [[Geographical Indications in India|Geographical Indications]] by the [[Government of India]]. The textile boom in the early 20th century and rapid growth due to industrialization has seen Erode becoming a major producer of [[handloom]] and [[knitwear]].

== Etymology ==
There are two theories regarding the origin of the name Erode. It might have its origin in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] phrase ''Eeru Odai'' meaning ''two streams'' based on the water courses [[Perumpallam Canal|Perumpallam]] and [[Pichaikaranpallam Canal|Pichaikaranpallam canals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://erode.dcourts.gov.in/about-department/history/|title=History of Erode district|work=[[Government of Tamil Nadu]]|access-date=1 June 2024}}</ref> Alternatively, it might have been derived from the Tamil phrase ''Eera Odu'' meaning 'wet skull', based on the temple of [[Shiva]] in the city and the [[Hindu mythology|mythology]] associated with it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for Over 5000 Natural Features, Countries, Capitals, Territories, Cities, and Historic Sights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzIer-wYbnQC&q=erode+wet+skull&pg=PA119|page=119|last=Room|first=Adrian|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1814-5|year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place Names|author=John Everett-Heath|year=2017|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19255-646-2|page=655}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of the Madras Geographical Association: Volumes 5-6|year=1931|publisher=[[Indian Geographical Society]]|page=31-32}}</ref>

== History ==
During [[Sangam period]], the region formed a part of the [[Kongu Nadu]] region ruled by [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] and then by [[Kalabhra dynasty|Kalabhras]]. The region came under the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyas]] around 590 [[Common Era|CE]]. Afterward, it was ruled by [[Rashtrakutas]] and by [[Cholas]] from the 10th to early 13th century. Erode was annexed by [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in 1378 CE till 1559 CE. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the [[Madurai Nayaks]] established their state as an independent kingdom introducing the [[Polygar|Palayakkarar system]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=The land called Kongunad|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/11/19/stories/2005111902090200.htm|access-date=9 June 2010|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=19 November 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528171005/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/11/19/stories/2005111902090200.htm|archive-date=28 May 2011}}</ref> Erode became a part of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty|Wodeyar]]-ruled [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore Kingdom]] in the early 1700s CE before coming under the control of the [[British East India Company]] with [[Maharaja of Mysore]] still as a nominal ruler.
