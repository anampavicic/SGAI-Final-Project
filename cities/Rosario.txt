'''Rosario''' ({{IPA|es|roˈsaɾjo}}) is the largest city in the central [[provinces of Argentina|Argentine province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. The city, located {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Buenos Aires]] on the west bank of the [[Paraná River]], is the third-most populous city in the country after Buenos Aires and Cordoba. With a growing and important [[metropolitan area]], [[Greater Rosario]] has an estimated population of 1,750,000 {{As of|2020||lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://poblacion.population.city/argentina/rosario/ | title=Rosario · Población | access-date=17 July 2020 | archive-date=19 July 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719112212/http://poblacion.population.city/argentina/rosario/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=eph>{{cite web |title=Encuesta Permanente de Hogares.

The city is also famous for being the birthplace of the legendary Argentine footballer [[Lionel Messi]].

Rosario is the head city of the [[Rosario Department]] and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in Argentina. The city is a major [[rail transport|railroad]] terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern Argentina. Ships reach the city via the Paraná River, which allows the existence of a {{convert|34|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-deep}} [[port]]. The [[Port of Rosario]] is subject to [[silting]] and must be [[dredge]]d periodically.<ref>http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2006/08/30/economia/noticia_322334.shtml{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> [[Export]]s include [[wheat]], [[flour]], [[hay]], [[linseed]] and other [[vegetable oil]]s, [[maize|corn]], [[sugar]], [[lumber]], [[meat]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and [[wool]]. Manufactured goods include flour, sugar, meat products, and other foodstuffs. The [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]], opened in 2004, spans the Paraná River, connecting Rosario with the city of [[Victoria, Entre Ríos|Victoria]], across the [[Paraná Delta]]. The city plays a critical role in agricultural commerce, and thus finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy.

Along with [[Paraná, Entre Ríos|Paraná]], Rosario is one of the few Argentine cities that cannot point to a particular individual as its founder. The city's patron is the "[[Our Lady of the Rosary|Virgin of the Rosary]]", whose feast day is 7 October.

==History==
{{main|History of Rosario}}

===Early settlement===
[[File:Ciudad del Rosario de Santa Fe (1858).jpg|200px|thumb|Map of the city of Rosario {{circa}} 1877]]
[[File:Puerto Rosario 1868.jpg|thumb|200px|Rosario port area in 1888]]

Even though the city did not have a clear foundation date or any official acknowledgement thereof, most commentators state that Rosario was founded on 7 October 1793 with a local population of 457 inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.argentinaturistica.com/rosiresenia.htm History of Rosario] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220171500/http://argentinaturistica.com/rosiresenia.htm |date=2009-02-20}}</ref> Nonetheless, the town was officially declared a ''city'' on 3 August 1852, at the time it was known as ''Pago de los Arroyos'' ("land of the [[stream]]s"), a reference to the several small rivers that traverse the southern region of Santa Fe, like the [[Ludueña Stream]], the [[Saladillo Stream]] and others, emptying into the [[Paraná River]]. In 1689, captain Luís Romero de Piñeda received part of the lands of the Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree, as payment for services to the Spanish Crown. Before that, the area was originally inhabited by various indigenous tribes, some of which lived in ''[[Indian Reductions|reducciones]]'', a type of [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] founded by [[Franciscan]]s. These missions were ultimately attacked and destroyed by hostile tribes of the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] region.

Romero de Piñeda established the first permanent settlement, an ''estancia'' — intended as farmland, not as a town. In 1719, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] bought another part and established ''Estancia San Miguel''. The area was still so scarcely populated that it had no central authority; it was ruled from the provincial capital ([[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]]), and in turn from Buenos Aires.

In 1724, another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro, who set up a mill, drew plans for the future town, built a [[chapel]], and was appointed [[mayor]] in 1751. The area of control of this local government extended northward from today's Rosario; only in 1784 was it divided into two smaller jurisdictions.

On February 27, 1812, General [[Manuel Belgrano]] raised the newly created [[Flag of Argentina|Argentine flag]] on the shores of the Paraná, for the first time. Because of this, Rosario is known as the "Cradle of the Argentine Flag". The [[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|National Flag Memorial]] marks the occasion.

===19th century===
[[File:Aduana Rosario.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rosario's old Customs Office, on Belgrano Avenue]]
The province of Santa Fe suffered greatly from the civil war that afflicted Argentina after 1820. Demographic growth was relatively slow. During this period, Rosario was a small settlement and a stop on the way from the city of Santa Fe to Buenos Aires. In 1823, it was elevated to the category of "village" (''Ilustre y Fiel Villa del Rosario''). [[Charles Darwin]] [[The Voyage of the Beagle|travelled]] through the area in 1832 and described Rosario as "a large town" with about 2,000 residents. In 1841, a decree of the ''[[caudillo]]'' and Governor of Buenos Aires, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], banned navigation of the Paraná and [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]] rivers to non-Argentine vessels, and thus shut off the [[Port of Rosario]] to [[International trade|foreign trade]].

On 25 December 1851, a small group of locals and the military guard of the city declared their support for the rival ''caudillo'' [[Justo José de Urquiza]]. As a reward for their participation in the [[Battle of Caseros]], triumphant Urquiza wrote to the governor of Santa Fe on 9 June 1852 asking for Rosario to be granted city status. Governor [[Domingo Crespo]] justified the request at the provincial legislative body, marking the geographically strategic position of the town for national and international trade, and on 5 August, Rosario was formally declared a city.

Urquiza opened up the river for free international trade. The city's economy and population expanded at an accelerated rate. By 1880, Rosario had become the first [[Foreign trade of Argentina|export outlet of Argentina]]. During the last 15 years of the 19th century, the city more than doubled its population, in part due to [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]]. By 1887 it had about 50,000 inhabitants, of whom 40% were [[Great European immigration wave to Argentina|European immigrants]], who brought new ideas from Europe and began to turn Rosario into a [[Political progressivism|politically progressive]] city (contrasting with the more [[Conservatism|conservative]], aristocratic Santa Fe).

During the second half of the 19th century, there was a movement promoting that the city of Rosario become the capital of the republic. [[Ovidio Lagos]], founder of the oldest Argentine newspaper, ''[[La Capital]]'', was one of the strongest proponents of this idea ([[Ovidio Lagos Avenue|one of the main avenues in Rosario]] now carries his name). Rosario was indeed declared the federal capital on three occasions, but each time the law was vetoed by the Executive Branch (once by [[Bartolomé Mitre]] and twice by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]). In 1911, the French-owned railway company [[Ferrocarril Rosario y Puerto Belgrano]] opened a line between Rosario and [[Puerto Belgrano]], Argentina's main naval base. By 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many coming from Europe in the wake of World War I.

===Modern history===
[[File:Monumento a la Bandera, Rosario.jpg|thumb|200px|[[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|National Flag Memorial]], downtown Rosario]]

In 1969 workers and students took to the streets and organized strikes in what has been dubbed the "[[Rosariazo]]" against the dictatorship. A few years later, in 1976, the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] made hundreds of dissident citizens "[[forced disappearance|disappear]]" in what is known as the [[Dirty War]].

In 1983, Argentina returned to democratic rule, but in 1989, [[hyperinflation]] caused the economic collapse of the country. In Rosario there were [[1989 riots in Argentina|riots]] and looting episodes. Under the [[Carlos Menem|Menem administration]], the situation worsened as the industrial sector of the city was dismantled by foreign competition, and agricultural exports stagnated. In 1995, [[unemployment]] in the area reached 21.1% and a large part of Rosario's population fell below the [[poverty line]].

Since the recovery of the [[Economy of Argentina|national economy]] that followed the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|2001 collapse]], Rosario's economic situation has improved. The boom in agricultural exports has caused a large increase in [[consumer spending]] and investment. The [[Socialist Party of Argentina|Socialist Party]] has won mayoral races in the city in every election since Councilman [[Héctor Cavallero]]'s 1989 election. Cavallero's successor, [[Hermes Binner]] (elected in 1995), was elected [[Governor of Santa Fe]] in 2007 and became the runner-up in the [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011 presidential election]] on the [[Broad Progressive Front (Argentina)|FAP]] ticket. Mayor [[Miguel Lifschitz]]'s administration, elected in 2007, took advantage of the economic boom to invest heavily in [[public works]] as well as in public health (which takes up about a quarter of the whole [[budget]]). Mayor [[Mónica Fein]] became, in 2011, the first Socialist woman elected mayor in Argentine history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mónica Fein ganó las elecciones municipales de Rosario con el 50% de los votos |url=http://www.agenciafe.com/noticias/val/162810/m%C3%B3nica-fein-gan%C3%B3-las-elecciones-municipales-de-rosario-con-el-50-de-los-votos.html |url-status=dead |work=Agencia Fe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318045549/http://www.agenciafe.com/noticias/val/162810/m%C3%B3nica-fein-gan%C3%B3-las-elecciones-municipales-de-rosario-con-el-50-de-los-votos.html |archive-date=2012-03-18}}</ref>

After the 1990s, Rosario became a major city of the illegal drug trade in Argentina, headed by a drug dealing family called "Los Monos" ("The Monkeys").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/nemm4d/los-monos-the-drug-gang-of-rosario-argentinas-most-violent-city|title=Los Monos: The Drug Gang of Rosario, Argentina's Most Violent City|last=Cavanagh|first=Gastón|date=August 28, 2014|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112033656/https://www.vice.com/en/article/nemm4d/los-monos-the-drug-gang-of-rosario-argentinas-most-violent-city|archive-date=November 12, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref> Early during 2018, it was estimated by national news sources that a turf war between local drug gangs ("Los Funes" and "Los Camino") was costing an average of one life every twenty five hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/policiales/medio-guerra-narco-rosario-mes-violento-ultimos-anos_0_HyXe0E8pG.html|title=En medio de una guerra narco, Rosario tuvo el mes más violento de los últimos cuatro años|trans-title=In the middle of a drug war, Rosario had the most violent month in the last four years|last=Aguilar|first=Mauro|date=May 1, 2018|website=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|language=es|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210322003757/https://www.clarin.com/policiales/medio-guerra-narco-rosario-mes-violento-ultimos-anos_0_HyXe0E8pG.html|archive-date=March 22, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/crime-spirals-out-of-control-in-troubled-rosario.phtml|title=Crime spirals out of control in troubled Rosario|last=Hiba|first=Jorgelina|date=October 5, 2020|website=BA times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116115454/https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/crime-spirals-out-of-control-in-troubled-rosario.phtml|archive-date=January 16, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Rosario}}
[[File:Palacio de los Leones 5.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|''Palacio de los Leones'' (City Hall)]]

Rosario is ruled by an executive branch represented by a [[mayor]] (seat: [[Palacio de los Leones]]), and a legislative branch, consisting of a Deliberative Council (seat: [[Palacio Vassallo]]). The mayor is elected for a four-year term, and the Council renews half of its 21 members every two years.

===Municipal Centre District (CMD)===
Since 1997, a municipal program of decentralization of legislative activities was carried out, materialized in 6 Municipal Centres of District (Centre, North, South, West, Northwest and Southwest).

The city is divided into six large administrative [[Districts of Rosario|districts]] (Center, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, and South), with Municipal District Centers that provide services to the population.

For years, local people and institutions have been pushing the provincial government to grant Rosario the status of [[Autonomous city#Argentina|Autonomous City]]. Some, with the sponsorship of the governors of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Córdoba as well as other important politicians, have put forward a legislative project to move the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]] to Rosario, to [[decentralisation|decentralize]] the national government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/proponen-trasladar-el-congreso-nacional-la-ciudad-rosario-n2600086.html|title=Proponen trasladar el Congreso nacional a la ciudad de Rosario|trans-title=Proposal to move the National Congress to the city of Rosario|date=July 30, 2020|website=[[La Capital]]|language=es|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210407193134/https://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/proponen-trasladar-el-congreso-nacional-la-ciudad-rosario-n2600086.html|archive-date=April 7, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=April 7, 2021}}</ref>

Since the return to democracy in 1983, the mayors of Rosario were [[Horacio Usandizaga]], [[Héctor Cavallero]] (standing in for Usandizaga, then re-elected), [[Hermes Binner]] (re-elected once), [[Miguel Lifschitz]] (re-elected once), and, since December 2011 to December 2019, [[Mónica Fein]]. Currently, the mayor is Pablo Javkin, whose term lasts from December 2019 to 2023. From Cavallero on (1989), the mayor has been a member of the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]], since December 2019, Rosario's mayor is from a different political party, ending more than 30 years of socialism.

The city does not have a [[police]] force of its own (it is served by the provincial police), but in 2004 it pioneered the creation of a special patrol force of unarmed officers called ''Guardia Urbana Municipal'' ("Municipal Urban Guard"), which was later used as a model for [[Buenos Aires]] and other cities.

===Municipal statistics===
The municipality of Rosario comprises {{convert|178.69|km2|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|abbr=on|117.2|km2|sqmi|0}} are urbanized, in 6,306 housing blocks. Of this area, {{convert|abbr=on|9.3|km2|sqmi|1}}, 5.3% is devoted to green spaces (parks, boulevards, plazas), which gives over 10 m<sup>2</sup> of green space per inhabitant.

Electric power is supplied to the whole urban area and running water reaches 97% of the population (about 350,000 homes). Natural gas is provided to 227,152 homes.<ref>[http://www.rosario.gov.ar/sitio/caracteristicas/estadistica1.jsp?nivel=Caract&ult=C_2 Municipalidad de Rosario, estadisticas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226232959/http://www.rosario.gov.ar/sitio/caracteristicas/estadistica1.jsp?nivel=Caract&ult=C_2 |date=2007-02-26 }} Spanish</ref>

With the recovery of the national economy since 2002, the city experienced a real-estate boom. In the period 2003–2006, the construction sector added 2&nbsp;million m<sup>2</sup>, investing about $900 million. Despite this increased supply, both price and rent have increased sharply compared to the values during the 1990s.

According to experts, this growth was propelled by the increased purchasing power of farmers around Rosario, helped by competitive exports, and the overall preference for safer investment options.<ref>[http://www.rosario3.com/noticias.aspx?idNot=2563 Government statistics 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045916/http://www.rosario3.com/noticias.aspx?idNot=2563 |date=2007-09-28 }} Spanish</ref>

Rosario is the centre of a metropolitan region whose economy is based on services and industry, generating the second-largest urban [[Gross state product|gross regional product]] of Argentina, after Greater Buenos Aires.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=World Trade Centers Association|url=https://www.wtca.org/world-trade-center-rosario|access-date=7 March 2021|archive-date=4 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304183146/https://www.wtca.org/world-trade-center-rosario|url-status=live}}</ref> The principal manufacturing sector is the agro industry, whose industries are placed in the northern and southern areas of [[Greater Rosario]]; the investments over the last decade have transformed Rosario into a major role of processing oil of the world<ref>http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/rural/2006/02/04/r-00601.htm[Clarin] {{Dead link|date=March 2022}}</ref> Many other sectors contribute to the diversified industrial offerings of the city. Rosario and its metropolitan area produce 20% of the cars, 4% of the domestic refrigerators, 80% of the machinery for the food industry and 100% of the auto bodies for long-distance buses made in Argentina.

Other important sectors include the petrochemical sector, with three plants located in the suburbs of San Lorenzo and Port San Martin; the chemistry sector, with plants for sulphuric acid, fertilizers, resins and other products; the cellulose industry; the [[meat industry]]; ironworks; auto parts; the plants and equipment for bottled oil; agricultural machinery; and the materials and equipment for the construction industry.
Worldwide international companies settled in Rosario include, among others, [[General Motors]], [[Cargill]], [[Unilever]], [[John Deere]], [[Petrobrás]], [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], [[Dow Chemical|Dow]], [[Tenneco]] and [[Mahle GmbH|Mahle]].

The main financial bank at the city of Rosario is the [[Municipal Bank of Rosario]]. Its central offices are located in the financial district, on [[San Martín Street (Rosario)|San Martín St.]], and there are several additional offices throughout the city. It is focused on [[small and medium enterprise]]s and other organizations, especially through [[microcredit|micro credit]]s, and may be considered an "[[ethical bank]]."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guadaloupe.org/guadalupe/content/view/16/32/ |title=Guadalupe |access-date=2018-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630031717/http://guadaloupe.org/guadalupe/content/view/16/32/ |archive-date=2017-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Municipal Bank was founded in 1896 to support the financial needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province, centered in Rosario. At the time, the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already [[Port of Rosario|the most important port]] on the Paraná River. The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by Mayor Floduardo Grandoli, citing the proliferation of "centers of [[usury]]" that exploited those in need of credit, especially the poor (something not addressed by the profile of the [[New Bank of Santa Fe|Provincial Bank of Santa Fe]], which granted loans only to demonstrably solvent persons). Acting on this, the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill (on 1 February 1895) dictating an "Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts;" the bank opened exactly one year later.

The seat of the bank was moved in 1905. Its name was changed to its present form on 14 May 1940 by a municipal bill. Its location was moved again, for the last time so far, in 1986. Following some political controversy, the bank in 2006 was capitalized by the municipality to comply with new regulations dictated by the [[Banco Central de la República Argentina|Central Bank]], and transformed into a [[joint stock company]], with only 1% of the stock belonging to the municipal state. A special clause was added, dictating that this minimum share is unchangeable, to prevent hypothetical attempts at [[privatization]].<ref>[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2006/07/05/economia/noticia_307357.shtml La Capital] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20070824210751/http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2006/07/05/economia/noticia_307357.shtml |date=2007-08-24}}</ref>

The [[Rosario Board of Trade]] hosts the country's largest [[commodity]] market, dealing in cereals and oilseeds, and also the largest [[futures exchange]] (ROFEX). The banking sector includes the state-owned [[Municipal Bank of Rosario]], with branches and offices throughout the city, and the central branch of the [[New Bank of Santa Fe]].

The largest technological center in Argentina – [[Rosario Technological Center|Polo Tecnológico Rosario (PTR)]] – is located in Rosario within [[La Siberia]] site. The center focuses mainly on research and development of the three following areas: biotechnology, software development, and telecommunications. It currently employs 3,500 people, and it is expected to grow 100% by 2015 to become one of the largest in Latin America.

==Culture==
Rosario has many cultural activities in many artistic disciplines with national and international reach. The city has produced important personalities in the fields of music, painting, philosophy, politics, poetry, literature, medicine, and law. Among the city's important theaters are [[El Círculo Theater|El Círculo]], [[Sala Lavardén]], Broadway, Astengo Auditorium, and La Comedia. A cultural complex known as [[Puerto de la Música]],<ref>[http://www.elpuertodelamusica.com.ar/ Puerto de la Música] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703095107/http://www.elpuertodelamusica.com.ar/ |date=2011-07-03}}</ref> designed by the modernist architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (of [[Brasilia]] fame), is to be built along the banks of the Paraná River. If completed, it will be one of the largest centers for musical performance in Latin America. In 2012, after years without progress, it was put on indefinite hold due to financial constraints. January 1995 saw the launch of the Rosario District Fishing Championship, held in the Parana River. Three years later, in 1998, a 10-year-old Lionel Messi was crowned Junior Champion.

The city has several [[museum]]s, including [[Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum]], [[Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum]], [[Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum]], [[Municipal Museum of the City (Rosario)|City Museum]], and [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario]] (MACRo). The [[Dr. Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum]] was rebuilt after a fire in 2003 and re-opened at a new location in 2006. Rosario also has a public astronomy complex, located in [[Parque Urquiza (Rosario)|Urquiza Park]], which consists of an [[observatory]] (inaugurated in 1970) and a [[planetarium]] (1984).

The [[Fundación Italia]] is a cultural institution created in 1985 as a "cultural bond with Italy". It has organized a [[Music of Naples|Neapolitan]] music concert, performances of ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'' and numerous talks about the present and future of Argentina. Among the people invited to give these talks were economists [[Domingo Cavallo]] and [[Alfonso Prat Gay]], renowned scholars [[Beatriz Sarlo]] and [[economist|Silvia Bleichmar]], journalists [[Alejandro Rozitchner]] and [[journalist|Jorge Asís]], filmmaker [[Fernando Solanas]] and former presidents of Chile ([[Ricardo Lagos]]), Argentina ([[Eduardo Duhalde]]), and Uruguay ([[Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera]]).

[[File:Rosario National Flag Memorial View-20110510-RM-144455.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90|right|Rosario seen from the Flag Memorial]]
The National Flag Memorial in Rosario is a monumental complex built near the banks of the Paraná River. It was commissioned in 1944 and inaugurated on June 20, 1957 – the anniversary of the death of [[Manuel Belgrano]], creator of the Argentine flag, who raised it for the first time on an island in the river on February 27, 1812.

The complex has a total area of about {{convert|abbr=on|10,000|m2|sqft|-2}} and was constructed using stone primarily sourced in the Andes. The structure was designed by the architects [[Ángel Guido]] and [[Alejandro Bustillo]], and the monument was adorned with works by sculptors [[Lola Mora]], [[Eduardo Barnes]], [[Alfredo Bigatti]], and [[José Fioravanti]].<ref>[http://www.monumentoalabandera.gov.ar/ Monumento Histórico Nacional a la Bandera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512121639/http://www.monumentoalabandera.gov.ar/ |date=2009-05-12 }} (official website, in Spanish)</ref><ref>[http://www.argentinaturistica.com/informa/rosicircuitostur.htm ArgentinaTuristica.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228192505/http://www.argentinaturistica.com/informa/rosicircuitostur.htm |date=2009-02-28 }} (touristic guide, in Spanish)</ref>

The Memorial (Monumento) has three parts: the Tower (Torre) or mast, {{convert|70|m|ft|0}} high, which commemorates the Revolution of May 1810 and houses Manuel Belgrano's crypt in its base; the Civic Courtyard (Patio Cívico), which symbolizes the effort of the organization of the state (the Courtyard is used for massive open-air shows), and the Triumphal Propylaeum (Propileo Triunfal), representing the nation as organized after the 1853 Constitution. Under the Propylaeum there is the Honor Room for the Flags of America (where the flags of all American nations are displayed).

The complex faces Belgrano Avenue, and is delimited by Córdoba and Santa Fe Streets, the latter of which slopes down towards the river at this point. The Propylaeum can be accessed from the pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento ("Oath Passage"), which starts at Buenos Aires St. between the municipal building (Palacio de los Leones) and the Cathedral, in front of Plaza 25 de Mayo (May 25 Square). Statues flank the passage by famous sculptor Lola Mora.

The Memorial and the National Flag Park located in front of it are the seat of the main celebrations of Flag Day on June 20. The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the complex, in 2007, was marked by a special celebration and by the unveiling of a new lighting system.

Construction will begin at the end of 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014.

====Planetarium====
Located in Urquiza Park, Rosario's Municipal Astronomical Complex is one of the principal astronomical centers of the region.

The planetarium has a core team, together with its secondary elements, providing an artificial image of the sky through projections made on a fixed hemispherical dome that functions as a display.

The assembly is installed in the Room "Oscar Claudio Caprile", located in the heart of the magnificent building that is shaped like a comet.

For its technical characteristics in terms of size, quality of sound and image, and interior comfort, this room is considered among the best in the world.

The building in the shape of a comet forms a part of the complex that includes the "Prof. Victor Capolongo" observatory and the experimental science museum.

=====The observatory=====
Municipal Astronomical Observatory "Prof. Victor Capolongo" was inaugurated on June 18, 1970, and named its first director.

The Observatory facilitates outreach, teaching, and research in the field of astronomy and related sciences and informs the public of phenomena that occur in the sky, such as eclipses, planetary configurations, passages of comets, etc.

To that end, the Observatory has installed two telescopes. One Coudé refractor has a {{convert|abbr=on|150|mm|in|1}} aperture and {{convert|abbr=on|2250|mm|in|1}} focal distance provided with Lyot's monochromatic filter for solar observation. Another Cassegrain reflector has {{convert|abbr=on|300|mm|in|1}} aperture, constructed by the Carl Zeiss company.

There are realized observations and astronomical photography of all the visible celestial objects in Rosario's sky, according to time of year and especially the Sun, the Moon, and the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Venus.

The asteroid [[14812 Rosario]] was named in the city's honor as a result.<ref>[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=14812 JPL Small-Body Database Browser - 14812 Rosario (1981 JR1)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815063844/http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=14812 |date=15 August 2014 }} Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA)</ref>

=====Experimental Science Museum=====
This museum was inaugurated on September 24, 1987. It is the first in Argentina and differs from traditional museums, in that it has equipment and instruments to demonstrate the laws of nature, which can be interactively used by the general public.

Thus, visitors of all ages can use telescopes and microscopes or experiment with lasers, sound mixers, radios of various types, computers, solar cells, etc.

To complement this, exhibit panels have photographs and explanatory texts of science and technology: mathematics and computer science, engineering, physics, astronomy, astronautics, geology, chemistry, and biology. In addition, an important area is intended for periodic samples, such as the [[Space Age]], energy: renewable and rational use, from sand to glass, among others. The museum staff is supported by contributions from the Ministry of Science and Technology Office, the Municipality of Rosario, and the contributions made by institutions and individuals.

The museum audiovisual projections are made in the Video Sector Science, which has an area called "CIENCIANIÑO" (ChildScience) for children aged 4 to 10. The museum works in the evening, similar to the Planetarium. Educational institutions at all levels are treated in shift assignments.

====Statue of Che Guevara====

Rosario is located in the [[provinces of Argentina|Province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], Argentina. This metropolis has a population of about 1.2 million (1,159,004 est.), thus being Argentina's third most populated urban settlement, after [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].<ref name="INDEC">[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina|INDEC]], 2001 census, updated by the Permanent Home Survey (first semester 2006). Published in ''[[La Capital]]'', 21 September 2006.</ref> Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself (population about 910,000) and a large area around it, spreading in all directions except eastward (because of the Paraná River). Directly to the south, it includes the city of [[Villa Gobernador Gálvez]], with a population of about 75,000, about {{convert|abbr=on|10|km|mi|1}} from Rosario city center.

To the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities ([[Funes, Santa Fe|Funes]], [[Roldán, Santa Fe|Roldán]], [[Pérez, Santa Fe|Pérez]], [[Soldini, Santa Fe|Soldini]]); Roldán is {{convert|abbr=on|23|km|mi|0}} from the Rosario city centre. These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario, and many people living there habitually [[commuting|commute]] to Rosario.

The farthest end is to the north, following the coast of the river; from Rosario, one finds, in succession and usually merging into each other, the towns of [[Granadero Baigorria]], [[Capitán Bermúdez]], [[Fray Luis Beltrán]], [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe|San Lorenzo]] (already in a different ''[[Departments of Argentina|departamento]]'', with a population of over 40,000), and [[Puerto General San Martín]], the last being at a distance of {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} from Rosario.

The north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called ''Cordón Industrial'' ("Industrial Corridor"), since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region. The prelude to the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|economic crisis]] in the 1990s largely dismantled the industrial infrastructure and damaged agricultural exports. These sectors were largely revitalized by [[2006 in Argentina|2006]] as the national economy continued to recover, but high levels of poverty and unemployment persist in the city's western neighborhoods (official surveys indicated that in 2011, 6.5% of the metro area population was under the [[poverty line]]; and that in 2012, 8.3% of the labor force was unemployed).<ref name=eph/><ref>{{cite web |title=La pobreza en Rosario bajó a 5,9% en el 2do semestre de 2011 |url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/economia/La-pobreza-en-Rosario-bajo-a-59-en-el-2do-semestre-de-2011-20120425-0068.html |work=La Capital |date=25 April 2012 |access-date=2 October 2012 |archive-date=29 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229084226/http://www.lacapital.com.ar/economia/La-pobreza-en-Rosario-bajo-a-59-en-el-2do-semestre-de-2011-20120425-0068.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1876 the total population was 203,509; by 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many having arrived from Europe in the wake of World War I. Most of these were Italian, and among them, a majority from the north-western region of [[Liguria]].

As of the 2010 Census, there were 1,193,605 people residing in the city and [[Greater Rosario|31 surrounding districts]], making Greater Rosario the third-largest metro area in Argentina even as its population growth has leveled off.<ref name=2010c/> The population density in Rosario proper was {{convert|6,680|/km2|/mi2|disp=preunit|inhabitants&nbsp;|inhabitants|sp=us}}; but, only about {{convert|2,400|/km2|/mi2|abbr=on}} in the suburbs.<ref name=censo>[http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/p020201.xls 2001 Census] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113154311/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/p020201.xls |date=2009-11-13}}</ref>

[[File:Club Español Rosario.jpg|thumb|''Club Español de Rosario'', club of the Spanish community in Rosario|alt=|left|277x277px]]

The 2010 Census also showed a relatively aged population. With 21% under the age of fifteen and 17% over sixty, the people have an age structure similar to those in many North American cities. They are, likewise, more elderly on average than Argentines as a whole (of whom 25% were under 15 and 14%, over 60).<ref name=2010c/>

The ethnic make-up of Rosario changed in the late 19th century, when significant numbers of European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this the city's population had been almost completely European-descent in ethnic origin. As [[Buenos Aires]] was the first landfall in Argentina for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1850s and 1890s, Rosario started to experience a diverse influx of people.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The main contributors were [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], the [[Balkans]] (especially [[Greece]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]), [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Scandinavia]] (especially [[Sweden]]). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.openedition.org/alhim/432|title=Dinámica migratoria: coyuntura y estructura en la Argentina de fines del XX|first1=Guillermo Angel|last1=Velázquez|first2=Sebastián Gómez|last2=Lende|date=3 November 2004|journal=Amérique Latine Histoire et Mémoire.

Most immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around [[Greater Rosario]]. However, in the first stages of immigration, some formed colonies (especially [[agricultural colonies in Argentina|agricultural colonies]]) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations.

[[Christianity]] is the dominant faith with [[Roman Catholicism]] as the most practiced, followed by [[Protestantism]]. [[Judaism]] is the second-most professed religion in the city as Rosario has one of the largest [[History of the Jews in Argentina|Jewish communities in Argentina]]. There is also a local [[Islam]]ic society.<ref>{{cite web |title=Entidades islámicas |url=http://www.islamerica.org.ar/izentida.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511235116/http://www.islamerica.org.ar/izentida.htm |archive-date=2013-05-11}}<!--Título generado por Muro Bot--></ref>

===Districts===
Rosario is divided into six districts, most named by location, although the easternmost is called ''Centre District'' for it includes the oldest part of the city, historically called ''Centro'' (City Centre). The data given below are from the {{census-ar|2001}}.

At Rosario city center, [[Córdoba Street (Rosario)|Córdoba Street]] is the main avenue. It begins at the Flag Memorial Park, climbs towards the district area, and becomes a pedestrian walk for seven blocks, between Plaza 25 de Mayo and Plaza Pringles. Along Córdoba Ave to the west ''[[Paseo del Siglo]]'' ("Walk of the Century") was settled, with former houses of wealthy families, finally there is also the ''[[Plaza San Martín (Rosario)|San Martín Square]]'', and elsewhere, ''[[Plaza Montenegro (Rosario)|Plaza Montenegro]]'' (on ''Peatonal San Martín'', the pedestrian-only four blocks of [[San Martín Street (Rosario)|San Martín Street]]) and ''[[Plaza Sarmiento (Rosario)|Plaza Sarmiento]]''.

[[Oroño Boulevard]] (going north–south) and [[Pellegrini Avenue (Rosario)|Pellegrini Avenue]] (east-west) mark the boundaries of the town center together with the river. At their confluence starts the [[Parque de la Independencia]], that houses the [[Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum]], the [[Newell's Old Boys]] football club, and the sports clubs ''Provincial'' and ''Gimnasia y Esgrima'', as well as the [[horseracing|horse racetrack]] and the former ''Sociedad Rural'' (Rural Society).

Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini Avenue, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.
To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main ''[[barrio]]s'' in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the [[Saladillo Stream]].

Among the districts in the west are [[Barrio Echesortu|Echesortu]], [[Barrio Belgrano (Rosario)|Belgrano]], Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy and [[Barrio Fisherton|Fisherton]]. To the north-east there lie [[Barrio Pichincha|Pichincha]], Ludueña, [[Barrio Lisandro de la Torre|Lisandro de la Torre]] (home of Rosario Central's stadium) and Empalme Graneros.

[[File:Rosario Dolfines Guaraní Nocturna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Night view of the luxury [[Dolfines Guaraní]] Towers, May 2010]]
Next to the stadium, there is the [[Parque Alem]], and nearby the Sorrento thermal [[power plant]]. To the north lie the districts of [[Barrio Alberdi|Alberdi]], La Florida (with a popular [[beach resort]] of the same name), Parque Field (built under US President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress development plans) and Rucci. The main streets are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]] and the city of [[Granadero Baigorria]]). These are crossed by the avenues Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.

An important part of Rosario's urban character is its riverbank. The city recovered the riverbank of the Paraná not long ago, thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system. Going from the center immediately north of the port, the riverbank is surrounded by a large number of parks; [[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|Argentine flag Memorial]], [[Parque de España]], [[park|Parque de las Colectividades]] and [[park|Parque Sunchales]].

===Greater Rosario===
Through the years, Rosario has spread in all directions. Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main neighborhoods in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the [[Saladillo Stream]] (the natural border with [[Villa Gobernador Gálvez]]). This is just south of the great barrio Grandoli.

Among the neighborhoods in the west are [[Barrio Echesortu|Echesortu]], [[Barrio Belgrano (Rosario)|Belgrano]], Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy, and [[Barrio Fisherton|Fisherton]] (near the west end of the city, formerly the home of hierarchical personnel of English railroad companies established in Rosario).
To the north-east there lie the neighborhoods of [[Barrio Pichincha|Pichincha]] (a [[red-light district]] in the early 20th century, now home to an open-air antiquities fair: ''Mercado de antigüedades "Feria Retro La Huella"''), Ludueña, [[Barrio Lisandro de la Torre|Lisandro de la Torre]] (home of the [[Rosario Central]] football club) and Empalme Graneros; these last three are in the influence area of the [[Ludueña Stream]], now contained by underground piping, but until the 1980s a source of floods.

Next to the Rosario Central stadium, there is a large park, [[Parque Alem]], and not far from it, there stands the Sorrento thermoelectric [[power plant]]. North of the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood, there are [[Barrio Alberdi|Alberdi]] (formerly an independent town), La Florida (with a popular [[beach resort]] of the same name), and Rucci.

The main streets in the north are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the north exit of the city, the access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, and the town of [[Granadero Baigorria]]). These major arteries are crossed by several avenues: Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.

== Transportation ==
Rosario's strategic location is destined to become a significant transportation hub and as the bi-oceanic corridor that links the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), an important component in global distribution and the core center of a key corridor in the [[Mercosur]], the Common Market for the South.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercosur.int/|title=Sitio Oficial del MERCOSUR|website=MERCOSUR|access-date=16 June 2019|archive-date=1 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220601000113/https://www.mercosur.int/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rosario, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 50 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3&nbsp;km, while 4% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rosario Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Argentina_Rosario-2560|access-date=June 19, 2017|archive-date=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019032147/https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Argentina_Rosario-2560|url-status=live}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=16 October 2017 }}.</ref>

=== Road transport ===
[[File:Terminal Mariano Moreno (Rosario) (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|Front entrance and clock tower of the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal in Rosario]]
[[File:Trolebús Línea K Rosario.jpg|thumb|[[Trolleybuses in Rosario|Trolleybus]] in the city centre]]
[[File:San Martín y Santa Fe.jpg|thumbnail|The city had a tramway network until 1963.]]
The Rosario public transport system includes buses, [[trolleybus]]es and taxicabs.

The [[Trolleybuses in Rosario|Rosario trolleybus system]] consists of only one main trunk line. It is presently operated by a [[government-owned corporation]], [[SEMTUR]] (Sociedad del Estado Municipal para el Transporte Urbano de Rosario, "Municipal State Society for Rosario Urban Transport"), as are some of Rosario's other urban bus lines.

[[Plaza Sarmiento (Rosario)|Plaza Sarmiento]] is the hub of the city bus system, about 40 urban lines in the metropolitan area that provide service every 5 to 10 minutes.

Bus fares are pre-paid by means of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper [[magnetic stripe card|card]] with a [[magnetic stripe]] which can be bought from [[post office]]s, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a [[coin]] machine in the bus unit. The interurban lines have differential fares, and some allow payment in cash only. The municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards, in favor of the plastic ones, during the second half of 2012.

The urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy, since 2003, and consists of about 730 units. In 2005 the average age of the buses was five years and 11 months. Improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles. According to the Rosario Transportation Office, in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month,<ref>[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2007/05/20/ciudad/noticia_390452.shtml Transporte de Rosario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009215824/http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2007/05/20/ciudad/noticia_390452.shtml |date=2007-10-09 }} Spanish</ref> by 2007, usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day (12.6 million per month).

A significant number of buses run on [[natural gas]], as it also happens in Argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives. The idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper; most buses run on heavily subsidized [[diesel fuel]].

In 2012 [[bus lane]]s were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area.<ref name="rosario.gob.ar"/> Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two. For the most part, they leave room to only one additional, narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles. They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well. They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden, as well as right turns. Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2012/03/05/noticia_0014.html|title=Carriles: los colectivos redujeron un 50% el tiempo para cruzar el centro|publisher=La Capital|date=5 March 2012|access-date=14 June 2012|archive-date=7 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107052048/http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2012/03/05/noticia_0014.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rosario has a medium-sized [[taxicab|taxi]] fleet, with units painted black and outlined in yellow. Some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone; others only in the streets. As the economy of Argentina recovers, the capacity of the taxi fleet has been strained by higher usage. In September 2005, the Deliberative Council approved the compulsory installation of radio-call systems in all taxi units, but this requirement has not been fulfilled.

Rosario is also a major hub for long-distance overland transportation from the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal,<ref>[http://www.terminalrosario.com.ar/  Terminal de Ómnibus Mariano Moreno] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929142356/http://www.terminalrosario.com.ar/ |date=29 September 2005 }} Spanish</ref> (''Terminal de Omnibus''), across from the [[Patio de la Madera]] Convention and Exposition Centre complex, about 15 blocks west of [[Plaza San Martín (Rosario)|Plaza San Martin]].
The transportation facility serves 73 bus companies in short, medium, and long-distance travel, carrying 1,100.000 passengers per month to 784 national and international destinations, which comprise most major domestic cities including [[Puerto Iguazú]], [[Salta]] and [[Bariloche]] and international destinations such as [[Asunción]], Paraguay, [[Curitiba]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil and [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, destinations may be long but white-clad chauffeurs handle comfortable [[Coach (vehicle)|long-distance coaches]] with modern conveniences.

=== Railway ===

[[File:Distrito Centro Rosario 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Center Municipal District (former Rosario Central station)]]
Rosario was one of the main cities chosen by the British and French [[railway company|railway companies]] that built and operated some of the railways in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with more than 15 stations operating in the city. When the entire Argentine railway network was [[railway Nationalisation in Argentina|nationalised]] during the presidency of [[Juan Perón]], most of the stations (by then under the administration of State-owned company [[Ferrocarriles Argentinos]]) were closed for [[passenger train|passenger]] services to reduce costs, leaving only a few active.

After the [[railway privatisation in Argentina|railway privatization]] in the early 1990s during [[Carlos Menem]]'s presidency, the passenger services were considerably reduced. The lines operated by [[Nuevo Central Argentino]] (NCA) handle most of the [[cargo]]. Additionally, two [[private company|private]] companies provided limited passenger services to several major cities. [[Trenes de Buenos Aires]] (TBA) ran weekly trains south to [[Retiro Mitre railway station|Retiro]] in Buenos Aires and north to [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]]. The company [[Ferrocentral]] also operated weekly trains south to Buenos Aires and northwest to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]].

Nowadays, passenger services to Rosario are being operated by [[Government owned corporation|state-owned company]] [[Operadora Ferroviaria Sociedad del Estado|Trenes Argentinos]], running trains to [[Rosario Norte Station|Rosario Norte]]<ref>[http://www.cferroviarios.com.ar/Mitre/descargas/Horarios_Rosario-StaFe.pdf Rosario - Santa Fe Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305105257/http://www.cferroviarios.com.ar/Mitre/descargas/Horarios_Rosario-StaFe.pdf |date=2015-03-05 }} Corredores Ferroviarios</ref> with stop in [[Rosario Sur Station|Rosario Sur]].

The other station in the main district, [[Rosario Oeste railway station|Rosario Oeste]], used to concentrate all the passenger services when railways were nationalised in 1948, but currently operates for [[freight train]]s only.

As of June 2021, only two stations remain active for passenger services in the city. The following chart describes the total of existing railway stations in Rosario:

==== Projects ====
{{See also|Buenos Aires-Rosario-Córdoba high-speed railway}}
There was a project to build a [[high-speed rail|high-speed train]] between [[Buenos Aires-Rosario-Córdoba high-speed railway|Buenos Aires-Rosario-Córdoba]], scheduled to be started in 2008, with an inauguration in 2012, that would join Rosario and Buenos Aires in 85 minutes, and would reach Córdoba in another 90 minutes at speeds of up to {{convert|320|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.rosarionet.com.ar/rnet/empresas.vsp?nid=38444 TAVe, Buenos Aires – Rosario – Córdoba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531165050/http://www.rosarionet.com.ar/rnet/empresas.vsp?nid=38444 |date=2011-05-31 }} accessdate=2008-05-12 Spanish</ref> However it never was constructed and the project was finally suspended after the controversy it generated among the citizens and the media critics because of the high costs it implicated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andinia.com/b2evolution/index.php/noticias-viajes-turismo-entretenimiento/turismo-viajes/viajes-tren-ferrocarril/ise-le-humedecio-la-polvora-al-tren-bala |title=¿Se le humedeció la pólvora al tren bala? |website=www.andinia.com |access-date=17 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707141301/http://www.andinia.com/b2evolution/index.php/noticias-viajes-turismo-entretenimiento/turismo-viajes/viajes-tren-ferrocarril/ise-le-humedecio-la-polvora-al-tren-bala |archive-date=7 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Trams ====
{{Main|Trams in Rosario}}
[[File:Tramway Rosario 2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|Tram tracks are still visible in parts of the city]]
The city once had a large tramway network with 192&nbsp;km of track in the centre of the city, however this was abandoned in 1963 after fierce competition from bus transport in the city.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-11270-2007-11-25.html Los tranvías de Rosario vuelven de la historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725230523/http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-11270-2007-11-25.html |date=25 July 2015 }} - Pagina/12, 25 November 2007.</ref> The city now has two heritage tramways, one of which uses vintage trams converted to run on rubber tyres, while the other uses the original trams from the city refurbished to run on rails.<ref>[http://www.tranviarosario.com.ar/recorridos/ Recorridos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725214727/http://www.tranviarosario.com.ar/recorridos/ |date=2015-07-25 }} - El Tranvia del Bicentinario</ref><ref>[http://www.tranviarosario.com.ar/imagenes/ Imágenes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725223430/http://www.tranviarosario.com.ar/imagenes/ |date=2015-07-25 }} - El Tranvia del Bicentinario</ref><ref>[http://archivo.lacapital.com.ar/2006/10/29/ciudad/noticia_338500.shtml A un siglo de su puesta en marcha, quieren que vuelva a rodar un tranvía ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105433/http://archivo.lacapital.com.ar/2006/10/29/ciudad/noticia_338500.shtml |date=2 April 2015 }} - La Capital, 29 October 2006</ref>

More recently, a metro system was proposed for the city, though this was shelved in favour of a new urban tramway network. The network is currently in the bidding process, with large firms like [[Siemens]] and [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]] bidding for its construction.<ref>[http://enelsubte.com/noticias/licitaran-tranvia-para-rosario/ Licitarán tranvía para Rosario] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725220338/http://enelsubte.com/noticias/licitaran-tranvia-para-rosario/ |date=25 July 2015 }} - EnElSubte, 22 July 2015.</ref> It is expected to begin at the recently inaugurated [[Rosario Sur Station]] and run northwards through the city.<ref>[http://www.notiexpress.com.ar/contentFront/rosa-locales-8/retoman-el-proyecto-para-licitar-un-tranvia-metropolitano--213285.html Retoman el proyecto para licitar un tranvía metropolitano ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726002250/http://www.notiexpress.com.ar/contentFront/rosa-locales-8/retoman-el-proyecto-para-licitar-un-tranvia-metropolitano--213285.html |date=2015-07-26 }} - 21 July 2015.</ref>

=== Roadways ===
Rosario is linked to the rest of the country by a number of roads: the Aramburu Highway (southeast, to Buenos Aires), [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]] (from Buenos Aires to Rosario and then north and west up to Jujuy and Bolivia), the [[Brigadier Estanislao López Highway]] (north, to Santa Fe City), National Route 11 (to the north of Santa Fe, Formosa and Paraguay), National Route 33 (to the southwest of Santa Fe and the province of Buenos Aires, and then through [[National Route 7 (Argentina)|National Route 7]] to San Luis, Mendoza and Chile), National Route 34 (north to Santiago del Estero, Tucumán and Bolivia), and National Route 174 (east, to Entre Ríos, over the [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]]).

It is surrounded with an extensive system of two belt-highways called [[National Route A008 (Argentina)|Circunvalación Motorway]] and [[National Route A012 (Argentina)|A012]] which in turn set the limits of the city.

The beltway is {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and was built for traffic to avoid the congested city centre, allowing drivers to bypass the city going around it in a much shorter time.
In its {{convert|30|km|mi|0|adj=on}} length, it intersects with [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]], [[National Route 3 (Argentina)|National Route 3]], National Route 34, National Route 11 and National Route 174.
[[File:Puente Rosario victoria y Luna.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]]]]

The official numbering system denotes this road as "A008" but this denomination is mostly unknown by the locals as it is still called "''Avenida de Circunvalación 25 de Mayo''" ("''25 of May Beltway Avenue''") commemorating the [[May Revolution]] of 1810. Some sections are named after different personalities by local decree. For example:

* The section from the east end on 27 Boulevard to the crossing of Ayacucho Street (old exit to the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway, now access to Provincial Route 21), is called ''"National Route A008 Tte. General Juan Carlos Sánchez"'' by decree #232 of 14 May 1981.
* The section between [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]] and the exit to [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] (the state capital) [[highway|National Route 11]] on the intersection with Rondeau Boulevard is called ''"National Route A008 Dr. Constantino Razzetti"'' by law #25769 of 1 September 2003.
The [[National Route A012 (Argentina)|A012]] is the second beltway at the southeast of the city. It has a semi-circular length centered around the city, running as a long-length beltway. From the [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]] junction on km marker 278, in the town of Esther, to the junction with [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 11]] on km marker 326 in the city of [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe|San Lorenzo]] it runs for {{convert|67|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}.

This road is popularly known as the ''Second Rosario Beltway'', as it borders the metropolitan area of greater Rosario.
Through National Decree 1595 of 1979<ref>[http://www.vialidad.gov.ar/legislacion_vial/documentos/doc%20pdf/Decreto%20Nacional%201595%2079%20Aprueba%20remodel%20red%20nacional%20cami%85.pdf National Decree 1595/79]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> this road switched to federal control. Beforehand this road was called Provincial Route 16.

=== Airports ===
{{Main|Rosario International Airport}}
[[File:Aeropuerto Internacional Rosario.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rosario – Islas Malvinas International Airport|Rosario International Airport]]]]

The [[Rosario – Islas Malvinas International Airport]] is located {{convert|13|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west-northwest from the center of Rosario, a city in the [[Santa Fe Province]] of [[Argentina]]. The city of Funes lies directly to the west of the airport, and part of the city limit shares a border with the property of the airport grounds. The airport covers an area of {{convert|550|ha|acre|abbr=off}} and is operated by the Province of Santa Fe.<ref name=AIP>{{cite web |url= http://www.cra.gov.ar/dta/ais/aip/docs/84.pdf |title= SAAR – Rosario / Islas Malvinas |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226060810/http://www.cra.gov.ar/dta/ais/aip/docs/84.pdf |archive-date= 2009-02-26 |language=es}}&nbsp;{{small|(84.3&nbsp;KB)}} at [[Aeronautical Information Publication|AIP]] Argentina</ref><ref name=ORSNA>{{in lang|es}} ''[http://www.orsna.gov.ar/aeropuertos/infoaeropuertos.asp?id_aeropuerto=35 Aeropuerto Internacional Rosario "Islas Malvinas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207084301/http://www.orsna.gov.ar/aeropuertos/infoaeropuertos.asp?id_aeropuerto=35 |date=2012-02-07 }}'' at ''Organismo Regulador del Sistema Nacional de Aeropuertos (ORSNA)''</ref>

The airport serves the [[Greater Rosario]] area and is the main hub for [[Sol Líneas Aéreas]] and is also served by [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]], [[Copa Airlines|Copa]] and [[Gol Transportes Aéreos]]. There are domestic flights within Argentina from Rosario to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Mar del Plata]] (via Buenos Aires), [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] (vía Córdoba), [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] and [[Villa Gesell]] (via Buenos Aires) cities as well as international services to, [[Porto Alegre, Brazil]], and [[Punta del Este, Uruguay]] (direct flight in summer and via Buenos Aires in fall, winter and spring).
The airport is at an altitude of {{convert|25|m}}. Its longest [[runway]] measures {{convert|9,843|ft|m|order=flip}}.

===Port===
{{Main|Port of Rosario}}
[[File:Muelles de Rosario (postal).jpg|thumb|250px|The Port of Rosario, {{circa|1910}}]]

The [[Port of Rosario]] is an inland port and a major goods-shipping centre of Argentina, located in the city of Rosario, [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], on the left-hand (western) shore of the Paraná River, about  {{convert|abbr=on|550|km|mi|-1}} upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>[http://www.unr.edu.ar/rosario/puerroi.htm Universidad Nacional de Rosario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609190926/http://www.unr.edu.ar/rosario/puerroi.htm |date=2008-06-09 }} – Details about the Greater Rosario area ports.</ref><ref>[http://www.conicet.gov.ar/diarios/2004/Octubre/nota22.php CONICET] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022135516/http://www.conicet.gov.ar/diarios/2004/Octubre/nota22.php |date=2008-10-22 }} – ''La ciudad y su zona de influencia tienen un polo portuario que atrae inversiones.'' Overview of the port economy in the Rosario area {{in lang|es}}.</ref>

At this point of the course of the Paraná River (Kilometer 420, Mile 260), there is the depth transition between overseas and river navigation. The main channel of the river directly in front of the port has an advantageous configuration that allows preservation of a depth of {{convert|34|ft|m|order=flip}} with minor periodic [[dredge|dredging]]. This allows for downstream navigation of vessels up to [[Panamax]] standards. The Paraná is about {{convert|600|m|ft|-1}} wide at Kilometer 418. It becomes {{convert|abbr=on|2,000|m|mi|1}} wide downstream.

The port is the largest of a series located in the several cities of the [[Greater Rosario]] that lie on the Paraná; the last (northernmost) able of overseas traffic being [[Puerto General San Martín]] ({{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}}. It is part of the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, which joins the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean via Buenos Aires, Rosario, [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]], and the [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]] region; going north–south it forms the axis of the [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]]-Paraná waterway. It directly services the area of Santa Fe that produces a large portion of Argentine exports, and indirectly the whole [[Mercosur]] [[trade bloc]]. In 2003 the traffic in the port amounted to {{convert|2.9|e6t|ST }}.

Cargo from other parts of Argentina is brought into the port by the railway lines of the [[Nuevo Central Argentino]], communicating with [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] (west) and [[Zárate, Buenos Aires]] (south), as well as the multiple national and provincial roads and highways that converge in Rosario. Communication with the north-eastern part of the country was enhanced by the 2003 opening of the [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]], that joins the city with the province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]. The [[Rosario International Airport]] (located {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} west) has also been refurbished to work with cargo traffic.

==Education==
[[File:Escuela Normal 2 Rosario.jpg|thumb|Teachers' School, on Córdoba Avenue]]
[[File:Facultad de Derecho Rosario 1.jpg|thumb|National University of Rosario Law School]]

Rosario is an important educational centre at a national and international level. It is the home of the [[National University of Rosario]] (UNR) since 1968, which includes the [[Facultad de Derecho (UNR)|Law Faculty]], the [[Facultad de Ciencias Médicas (UNR)|Medicine Faculty]], the Humanities Faculty and an advanced study centre called ''Ciudad Universitaria de Rosario'' (university city of Rosario) that is home to more than 10 colleges, among them the Faculty of Psychology, the Faculty of Political Sciences, and the Faculty of Architecture. It is also home of the [[Rosario Regional Faculty]], a branch of the [[National Technological University]] (UTN). All of these national colleges are free.

In the city there are approximately 624 establishments destined for elementary levels and secondary education, the Technical Institute, which depends directly on the UNR. With a solid tradition as for university education, it is head of several academic institutions, and is public, and free access.

Currently, there are some 80,000 university students at various institutions around the city, representing approximately 8.5% of the total population. This rate is one of the highest in Argentina. In Rosario, nearly 15% of the population benefits from higher education degrees, or have undergone at least some university studies.

Rosario has private colleges, as the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]] (UCA), the [[Austral University (Argentina)|Austral University]], the [[University of the Latin American Educational Center]] (UCEL), the [[Interamerican Open University]] (UAI), the Italian University of Rosario (IUNIR), the San Martin University and the University of Concepcion del Uruguay which are private institutions.

==Language==
Rosario is the third largest urban center where [[Rioplatense Spanish]] is spoken, after Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this [[dialect]], notably the [[voseo]] (use of ''vos'' instead of ''tú'' as pronoun for the second person singular) and the ''sheísmo'' (form of [[yeísmo]] where ''ll-'' and ''y-'' are pronounced as a [[voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}}). Although the ''español rosarino'' does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect, it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region.

One of the most notable characteristics of the language of Rosario's area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the ''-s''. When the ''-s'' is in implosive position, end of syllable or word followed by consonant, its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration [h] (the word ''obispo'' is pronounced '''o̞ˈβihpo̞'''). In the popular and vulgar language, the final ''-s'', ''-r'', or ''-d'' are sometimes suppressed, although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/33/TH_33_003_059_0.pdf |title=FONOLOGÍA DEL ESPAÑOL EN ROSARIO (ARGENTINA). |access-date=21 March 2012 |archive-date=12 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512220951/http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/33/TH_33_003_059_0.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Just as in Buenos Aires, the ''voseo'' is pronominal and verbal. The pronoun ''tú'' and its associated verbal forms are non-existent (which is not the case in the Montevideo variant) The tendency to add a final ''-s'' to the verbal forms of the second person plural (''vos fuistes'', ''vos vinistes''), which is rather common in Buenos Aires, is very unusual among Rosario natives.

Even though the [[lexicon]] of Rosario and Buenos Aires is effectively identical, there are numerous terms and idioms that Rosario shares with the rest of the country (even areas where a different dialect prevails) but not with the capital, as well as other words and expressions that are unique to the ''rosarino'' speech, both formal and informal.

The ''[[Rosarigasino]]'' is a type of [[Jerigonza]] (game of words) that originated in the city and was rather common in the informal speech during the 20th century. Although it has fallen into disuse, it has become a language of [[cult]] among certain local groups.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Rosario}}
[[File:Departamento Rosario (Santa Fe - Argentina).png|upright=0.80|right|thumb|Rosario metropolitan area in the Province of Santa Fe]]
The city of Rosario measures {{convert|abbr=on|178.69|km2|sqmi|1}}, not all of them are fully urbanized. Its extreme points are:
*[[Latitude]]: [[circle of latitude|parallel]]s 32°52′18″ and 33°02′22″ South.
*[[Longitude]]: [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]s 60°36′44″ and 60°47′46″ West.
The geographical center is approximately at {{Coord|32|57|2|S|60|42|15|W|}}

The city is located on a smoothly undulated plain typical of the [[Pampa]]s, between 22.5 and 24.6 metres [[above mean sea level]]; the original settlement rests on the [[ravine]] on the right-hand shore of the Paraná, opposite a group of islands of the [[Paraná Delta]] which are partly in the jurisdiction of the province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]. The nearest city across the river's [[flood plain]] (60&nbsp;km) is [[Victoria, Entre Ríos]], linked to Rosario by the [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]].

Rosario lies on the [[ravine]] of the right-hand shore of the Paraná, about {{convert|24|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level]], in a place with a natural slope to the low shore. The point of origin of the city is ''[[Plaza 25 de Mayo (Rosario)|Plaza 25 de Mayo]]'' ("[[May Revolution|May 25]] Square"), now surrounded by the municipality (''[[Palacio de los Leones]]''), the [[Basilica Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary]], the Central Post Office, the [[Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum|Decorative Art Museum]] and a building called ''La Bola de Nieve'' ("The Snowball"). Between the Cathedral and the municipal building is ''Pasaje Juramento'' ("Oath Passage"), leading to the Flag Memorial. The streets mostly follow a regular [[checkerboard]] pattern.

===Climate===
[[File:Clima Rosario (Argentina).PNG|thumb|upright=1.10|left|Climate chart]]

The Rosario area has a ''[[Pampa|Pampean]]'', [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen climate classification: Cfa/Cwa),<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{Cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/1908/ |title=Rosario - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |access-date=2015-11-22 |archive-date=23 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123042842/http://en.climate-data.org/location/1908/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and is well known for its changeable weather conditions. The city has average temperatures of {{convert|23.7|°C}} maximum and {{convert|11.8|°C}} minimum. The annual rainfall is {{convert|1038|mm|1|abbr=on}}.

Rosario is usually warmer than other mainland Argentine capital cities in the winter. The lowest average in winter is {{convert|4.4|°C|F|0}}. This is due in part to the city's flat topography, its situation on the Paraná River bank, and the presence of high density of urbanization. Those conditions have created a microclimate known as [[urban heat island]] that often means that the city is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas.

The temperature difference usually is greater at night than during the day, greater in winter than in summer and most apparent when winds are light. However snowfalls are extremely rare: the most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was on 9 July 2007.
During the spring Rosario commonly enjoys extended periods of warm weather and clear skies. Rosario has average day-night temperatures of {{convert|23|-|10|°C|F|0}}. The city experiences hot and humid summer days, with maximum temperatures above {{convert|35|°C|F|0}}, when northerly winds blow humid air from Brazil. The record high temperature is {{convert|40.5|°C|F|1}} on January 9, 2006, while the record low is {{convert|-8.4|°C|F|0}} on July 15, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/SMN_Argentina/status/1282998032695529474 |title=SMN Argentina |publisher=[[Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (Argentina)|SMN Argentina]] |access-date=2020-07-15 |archive-date=14 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200714113100/https://twitter.com/SMN_Argentina/status/1282998032695529474 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Broadcasting and communications ==
[[File:Telecom sede Rosario.jpg|thumb|200px|Rosario offices of [[Telecom Argentina]]]]
[[File:Diario La Capital Rosario 1.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Headquarters of ''[[La Capital]]'' newspaper]]

Rosario has two private local [[television channel]]s, [[Channel 3 - Rosario|Canal 3]] and [[Channel 5 - Rosario|Canal 5]] (the latter is part of the national network [[Telefé]]), and a relay station for the public national station, [[Canal 7 Argentina]]. There are also three cable TV networks (the national ones [[Grupo Clarín|Cablevisión and Multicanal]], and a local network, Cablehogar), which support two local channels, Canal 4 Noticias and Canal 6.

There are four [[amplitude modulation|AM]] radio stations: three private (licensed by the state) ones, LT3 Radio 2 (LT2), and LT8, and one public, Radio Nacional Rosario, property of the national state. Among the multitude (above 200) of [[frequency modulation|FM]] stations, some notable ones are FM Vida, Estación del Siglo, FM Del Rosario, Cristal FM, Radio Hollywood, Fisherton-CNN, Continental Rosario, Radio 10 Rosario, Radiofónica, and Clásica Rosario.

The city has three notable newspapers: ''[[La Capital]]'' (Argentina's oldest newspaper, founded in 1867, and still published today), ''[[Rosario/12]]'' (founded in 1991), and ''El Ciudadano & La Región'' (founded in 1999).

Rosario is located at the center of Argentina's [[optical fiber]] ring. The main data transport companies offer all their services in the city, from public phones to [[mobile telephone|mobile]] networks and [[broadband Internet access]] through [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], [[cable modem]] and [[Wi-Fi]], and including public Internet navigation centers ([[Internet cafe|cybercafes]]).

About 96% of homes have a domestic [[Communications in Argentina|telephone line]], giving a total of 472,170 lines; cell phone usage has also become pervasive, as happened in Argentina as a whole since the beginning of the 21st century, reaching over 86% of the residents (866,000 mobile lines in July 2004). This demand, boosted by low prices and sale promotions, and coupled with restrictions on the installation of antennas and alleged lack of investment by the providers, sometimes degrades the quality of the service. Most notably, the mobile network collapsed almost completely in the celebrations of [[Christmas]], [[New Year's Day]] and [[Día del Amigo|Friend's Day]] in 2004 and 2005.
