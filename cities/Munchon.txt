'''Munch'ŏn''' ({{IPA|ko|mun.tsʰʌn}}) is a [[North Korea]]n city located in [[Kangwon-do (North Korea)|Kangwŏn]] Province.  It lies on the coast of the [[Sea of Japan]] and borders [[Wonsan]].

==History==
During the era of [[Four Commanderies of Han]], the region was known as the Xietoumei prefecture under [[Lintun Commandery]]. During the later Han period, it was part of the kingdom of [[Eastern Ye|Dongye]] and became part of [[Goguryeo]] in the 3rd century. The region was called Maeguru at the time of King [[Gwanggaeto the Great]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.naver?docId=1095560&cid=40942&categoryId=39918|title=문천군|website=Doosan encyclopedia}}</ref>
Before 1413, the region was part of Hamgyong province, then known as Munju County, but due to the naming changes that follows the convention of changing regional names that end with ju to end with chon(川) or san(山), it became the county of Munchon. Manju was a sinicized name of the Korean name 'Mulgol (물골, water valley or town)' where the Korean word mul was substituted with mun which sounds similar to the Korean.<ref name="lk">{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0019688|title=문천시|website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]}}</ref> In 1946, the region became part of Kangwon province. In 1972, after numerous subdivision changes, the county was abolished and incorporated into nearby counties. The county was once again restored in 1976 when some parts of it were incorporated into the city of Wonsan. In 1991, the county was promoted to a city.<ref name="lk"/>
