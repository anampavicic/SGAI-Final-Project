Located in the south of the eponymous oblast, the city proper lies on the [[Angara River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], about 850 kilometres (530&nbsp;mi) to the south-east of [[Krasnoyarsk]] and about 520 kilometres (320&nbsp;mi) north of [[Ulaanbaatar]]. The [[Trans-Siberian Highway]] (Federal M53 and M55 Highways) and [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] connect Irkutsk to other regions in Russia and [[Mongolia]].

Many distinguished Russians were sent into exile in Irkutsk for their part in the [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825, and the city became an exile-post for the rest of the century. Some historic wooden houses still survive. When the railway reached Irkutsk, it had earned the nickname of "The Paris of Siberia." The city was the center of bitter fighting in the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1918–20. Afterward, in the Soviet period, its architecture was dominated by the mandatory squared-up style. The city became a major centre of aircraft manufacture. The historic centre of Irkutsk is included in UNESCO's [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|tentative list]] of [[World Heritage Site]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Centre |first=UNESCO World Heritage |title=Centre historique d'Irkoutsk |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1166/ |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Irkutsk was named after the [[Irkut River]]. Its name was derived from the [[Buryat language|Buryat]] word for "spinning," and was used as an ethnonym among local tribes, who were known as ''Yrkhu'', ''Irkit'', ''Irgit'', and ''Irgyt''. The city was formerly known as ''Yandashsky'', named after the local [[Tuvan people|Tuvan]] chief Yandasha Gorogi.<ref>Dameshek (2002), p. 16</ref>

The old spelling of the city's name was «Иркуцкъ». Before the revolution, the city was called "East Paris", "Siberian Petersburg", "Siberian Athens".

==History==
[[File:Irkutsk Kreml 1735.jpg|thumb|left|Irkutsk Castle in 1735]]

In 1652, Ivan Pokhabov built a ''zimovye'' (winter quarters) near the site of Irkutsk for gold trading and for collecting [[Yasak|fur taxes]] from the [[Buryats]]. In 1661, Yakov Pokhabov built an ''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]'' (a small fort) nearby.<ref name="Lantzeff">{{cite book|last=Lantzeff|first=George V., and Richard A. Pierce|title=Eastward to Empire: Exploration and Conquest on the Russian Open Frontier, to 1750|publisher=McGill-Queen's U.P.|year=1973|location=Montreal}}</ref> The ''ostrog'' gained official town rights from the government in 1686.

The Irkutsk prison, founded in 1661 as an outpost for the advancement of Russian explorers in the Angara region, soon ceased to be only a defensive structure due to the advantage of its geographical position. According to historical documents, 10 years later, in 1671, here, in addition to servicemen and [[yasak]] people, lived "plowed peasants with their wives and children." A [[posad]] appeared, which gave rise to residential quarters of the future city. As for the prison itself, as its influence in the region grew, it was completely rebuilt twice (in 1669 and 1693), expanding in size.<ref>[https://irk.aif.ru/irk_legend/irk_legend_details/78054 Иркутский острог, кремль и крепость – три названия, одна легенда]</ref><ref>[https://www.irk.ru/news/blogs/archivarius/1014/ Как застраивали Иркутск]</ref>

The fate of the prison was such that its military-defensive significance was less noticeable than other previously erected forts near the Angara, for example, Bratsk (1631) or Verkholensk (1644). However, its location at the crossroads of colonization, trade and industrial routes predetermined the role of Irkutsk in the history of Eastern Siberia. In 1682 it became the center of an independent region, and in 1686 it received the status of a city. Irkutsk at the beginning of the 18th century was divided into two parts: "small town", or the prison itself, and "big city". The first one started from the bank of the Angara and was a wooden fortress with adjacent buildings. These included the stone building of the provincial chancellery, the house of the vice-governor (former voivodship) with barns and cellars, the Church of the Savior. "Small town" was the administrative center of the vast Irkutsk province since 1731.<ref name="irkipedia.ru">[http://irkipedia.ru/content/irkutskiy_ostrog_vozniknovenie_i_osnovnye_etapy_razvitiya_goroda_irkutska Иркутский острог. Возникновение и основные этапы развития города Иркутска]</ref>

In the "big city", as the posad was called, the commercial and economic life of Irkutsk was concentrated. It was inhabited mainly by people from the northern regions of Russia: [[Veliky Ustyug]], [[Yarensk]], [[Pinega]], [[Solvychegodsk]], [[Pereyaslavl-Zalessky]], who brought their traditions, customs, and culture to Siberia.<ref name="irkipedia.ru"/>

The first road connection between [[Moscow]] and Irkutsk, the [[Siberian Route]], was built in 1760, and benefited the town economy. Many new products, often imported from [[China]] via [[Kyakhta]], became widely available in Irkutsk for the first time, including [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[fur]], [[wood]], [[silk]], and [[tea]]. In 1821, as part of the [[Mikhail Speransky]]'s reforms, Siberia was administratively divided at the [[Yenisei River]]. Irkutsk became the seat of the Governor-General of East Siberia.

[[File:Irkutsk-club.jpg|thumb|left|Irkutsk [[Assembly of the Nobility]] in the early 1900s]]
In the early 19th century, many Russian artists, officers, and [[nobility|nobles]] were sent into exile in Siberia for their part in the [[Decembrist revolt]] against [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas&nbsp;I]]. Irkutsk became the major center of intellectual and social life for these exiles, and they developed much of the city's cultural heritage. They had wooden houses built that were adorned with ornate, hand-carved decorations. Many still survive today, in stark contrast with the standard [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] apartment blocks that surround them.

[[File:Irkutsk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|Epiphany Cathedral and central Irkutsk in 1865]]
By the end of the 19th century, the population consisted of one exiled man for every two locals. People of varying backgrounds, from members of the Decembrist uprising to [[Bolshevik]]s, had been in Irkutsk for many years and had greatly influenced the culture and development of the city. As a result, Irkutsk became a prosperous cultural and educational center in [[Eastern Siberia]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gentes |first=Andrew A. |date=2003 |title=Siberian Exile and the 1863 Polish Insurrectionists According to Russian Sources |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41051062 |journal=Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=197–217 |issn=0021-4019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Isu - About Irkutsk |url=https://isu.ru/en/about_irkutsk/index.html |access-date=2023-11-06 |website=официальный сайт ФГБОУ ВО «Иркутский государственный университет» |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Collections from Siberia and the Russian Far East {{!}} Digital Collections from Russia {{!}} Articles and Essays {{!}} Meeting of Frontiers {{!}} Digital Collections {{!}} Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/meeting-of-frontiers/articles-and-essays/digital-collections-from-russia/siberia-and-the-russian-far-east/ |access-date=2023-11-06 |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>

From 1848 to 1861, Count [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]] was the Governor-General. He [[Amur Annexation|annexed the Amur Territory]] to Russia, however, on the spot he showed unbridled despotism and extreme cruelty. Since the opening of communication along the Amur in 1854, on the way from St. Petersburg to the Pacific Ocean, the old Yakutsk tract began to decline. The population of the city is 28,000, of them there were 3,768 exiles.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://st-yak.narod.ru/index6-7-1.html |title=160-ЛЕТИЕ ЯКУТСКО-АЯНСКОГО ТРАКТА |access-date=December 1, 2020 |archive-date=January 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127204027/http://st-yak.narod.ru/index6-7-1.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1879, on July&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;6, a fire burned out of control, destroying the palace of the Governor General, and the principal administrative and municipal offices. Many of the other public buildings, including the government archives, the library, and the museum of the Siberian section of the [[Russian Geographical Society]], were completely ruined.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Irkutsk (town) |display=Irkutsk|volume=14 |page=796 |inline=1}}</ref> Three-quarters of the city was destroyed, including approximately 4,000 houses.<ref name="Kennan">{{cite book|last1=Kennan|first1=George|title=Siberia and the Exile System|date=1891|publisher=James R. Osgood, McIlvaine & Co.|location=London|pages=1–2}}</ref> The city quickly rebounded, installing electricity in 1896. The first theater was built in 1897 and a major train station opened in 1898. The first train arrived in Irkutsk on August&nbsp;16 of that year. By 1900, the city had earned the nickname of "The [[Paris]] of Siberia."

[[File:Иркутск. Чешско-словацкие войска в Иркутске.jpg|thumb|Irkutsk in 1918]]
During the [[Russian Civil War]], which broke out after the [[October Revolution]], Irkutsk became the site of many furious, bloody clashes between the "[[White movement]]" and the "[[Bolsheviks]]", known as the "Reds". In 1920, [[Aleksandr Kolchak]], the once-feared commander of the largest contingent of anti-Bolshevik forces, was executed in Irkutsk. This effectively destroyed the anti-Bolshevik resistance.

Irkutsk was the administrative center of the short-lived [[East Siberian Oblast]], from 1936 to 1937. The city subsequently became the administrative center of [[Irkutsk Oblast]], after East Siberian Oblast was divided into [[Chita Oblast]] and Irkutsk Oblast.

During the communist years, the industrialization of Irkutsk and Siberia in general was strongly encouraged. The large Irkutsk Reservoir was built on the [[Angara River]] between 1950 and 1959 in order to generate hydroelectric power and facilitate industrial development.

[[File:Church of the Epiphany (Irkutsk).jpg|thumb|left|Epiphany Cathedral (built in 1718–1746)]]
The Epiphany Cathedral, the governor's palace, a school of medicine, a museum, a military hospital and the crown factories are among the public institutions and buildings.<ref name=EB1911/> The [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] monument, designed by [[Vyacheslav Klykov]], was unveiled in 2004. On July&nbsp;27, 2004, the Irkutsk Synagogue (1881) was gutted by a fire.

In December 2016, 74 people in Irkutsk [[2016 Irkutsk mass methanol poisoning|died in a mass methanol poisoning]], after drinking this toxic alcohol substitute.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Russia, Dozens Dies After Drinking Alcohol Substitute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/world/europe/russia-bath-lotion-deaths.html|first=Ivan|last=Nechepurenko|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 December 2016|access-date=19 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38395013 |title=Russia bath lotion poisoning: Putin orders crackdown as death toll rises |publisher=BBC |date=21 December 2016 |access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref>

==Geography==
Irkutsk is located about {{convert|850|km|mi}} to the south-east of [[Krasnoyarsk]], and about {{convert|520|km|mi}} north of [[Ulaanbaatar]], the capital of [[Mongolia]]. The city proper lies on the [[Angara River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], {{convert|72|km|sp=us}} below its outflow from [[Lake Baikal]] and on the bank opposite the suburb of Glaskovsk.<ref name=EB1911/> The river, {{convert|580|m|sp=us}} wide, is crossed by the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Dam and three other bridges downstream.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

The [[Irkut River]], from which the town takes its name, is a smaller river that joins the Angara directly opposite the city.<ref name=EB1911/> The main portion of the city is separated from several landmarks—the monastery, the fort and the port, as well as its suburbs—by another tributary, the Ida (or Ushakovka) River. The two main parts of Irkutsk are customarily referred to as the "left bank" and the "right bank", with respect to the flow of the Angara River.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

Irkutsk is situated in a landscape of rolling hills within the thick [[taiga]] that is typical in Eastern Siberia.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Frazier |first=Ian |date=2009-08-03 |title=Travels in Siberia—II |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/10/travels-in-siberia-ii |access-date=2024-01-07 |work=The New Yorker |language=en-US |issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

The population has been shrinking since the late 1980s: {{ru-census|p2010=587,891|p2002=593,604|p1989=622,301}}. According to the regional plan, Irkutsk city will be combined with its neighboring industrial towns of [[Shelekhov]] and [[Angarsk]] to form a metropolitan area with a total population of over a million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

The center of the historical part of the city is Kirov Square.

The historic center of the city is now in its place. By the beginning of the 18th century, it had turned into a wooden fortress, which protected the inhabitants from the raids of nomads. A major fire of 1716 almost completely destroyed the fortifications, but in just a year new ones were built, already made of stone. 

Of the buildings on the territory of the Irkutsk Kremlin of that time, the Savior Church has survived, the stone building of which was laid in 1706 in the north-western corner of the fort. Along with the Epiphany Cathedral, erected behind the eastern wall of the fortress and also preserved to this day, this is one of the oldest stone buildings in Siberia. The protective palisade and the moat, which once defended the Irkutsk fortress from the south, from the Angara bank to the Ushakovka River, existed until the middle of the 18th century. 

In early Irkutsk there were no streets at all, the buildings approached the driveways with random turns and only with subsequent alterations were turned around with front facades. The first settlers did not orientate their houses in relation to neighboring buildings either. When building a new house, the owners usually adhered only to the orientation of the windows to the south side. This is how the layout of the oldest part of the city took shape — from Angara to modern Karl Marx Street: the main directions of the streets repeat the outlines of the coastline, which, in turn, are crossed by transverse passages connecting the outskirts of the city with the center and overlooking the Angara bank. 

The curvature of the central streets and the disparity of the quarters formed by them, shows the spontaneous process of their formation. This is especially noticeable in the example of Basninskaya Street (now Sverdlova Street), which they tried to straighten with each new attempt to streamline the development. And it simply repeated the outlines of the log that once was here, formed, possibly, by the old lady of the Gryaznushka river, which connected Ushakovka and Angara.<ref>[Дамешек Л. М. и др. Иркутск в панораме веков: очерки истории города / Под ред. Л. М. Дамешек. — И.: Восточно-Сибирская издательская компания, 2002]</ref><ref name="irkipedia.ru"/>

In 1726, defensive fortifications (palisade) were built in Irkutsk, behind which the barracks of the local garrison were taken out. The construction of the palisade changed the process of the spontaneous evolution of buildings and influenced the formation of the city's layout in the most significant way. After the fortification was dismantled in 1790,<ref>Дамешек Л. М. и др. Иркутск в панораме веков: очерки истории города / Под ред. Л. М. Дамешек. — И.: Восточно-Сибирская издательская компания, 2002.</ref> a complete mismatch of street directions in the old and new parts of the city was revealed.

The state of development of the "pre-palisade" period is reflected in the first of the known plans of Irkutsk in 1729. Its main advantage is the fixation of the city's borders, which ran along the line of the modern Karl Marx Street. Between 1729 and 1768 in the space between Angara and Ushakovka, the first "zapalisadny" row of blocks is formed. A spontaneous settlement appears near the soldiers' barracks, first along the roads that approached the Mill and Overseas gates, and then between them. The development proceeded unevenly, the closest to the current state at that time were the fragments of buildings located in the area of Zamorskaya (Lenin st.) And Institutskaya (Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsii st.) Streets. Now it is, roughly, quarters No. 90, 91, 92.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

The last third of the 18th century was significant both for the history of the city as a whole and for the formation of its buildings. With the formation of the Irkutsk province in 1764, Irkutsk became the center of the largest region in Russia—Eastern Siberia, which included Transbaikalia, Yakutia, the entire northeast to the Pacific Ocean. Irkutsk needed to expand, and by that time there were no enemies ready to lay claim to the city. The palisade was dismantled, and in its place appeared Bolshaya Preshpektnaya Street, now Karla Marxa Street, the only straight street in modern Irkutsk. The devastating fire of 1879 made its own adjustments to the construction laws as it was from here that the border began, beyond which it was forbidden to build from wood. This has divided the old Irkutsk into two parts: closer to the Angara river, mainly stone buildings remained, and on the other side, where there were once outskirts, the wooden Irkutsk grew.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.culture.ru/institutes/5658/istoricheskii-centr-irkutska | title=Исторический центр Иркутска.

===Climate===
Irkutsk has a borderline [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen climate classification ''Dwb'', bordering ''Dwc'').

Irkutsk is characterized by an extreme variation of temperatures between seasons. It can be very warm in the summer, and very cold in the winter. However, [[Lake Baikal]] has a tempering effect, giving Irkutsk temperatures that are slightly less extreme than at similar latitudes elsewhere in Siberia. The warmest month of the year is July, when the average temperature is {{convert|+19|C}}; the highest temperature recorded being {{convert|+37.2|C}}. The coldest month of the year is January, when the average temperature is {{convert|−17.6|C}}, and record low of {{convert|−49.7|C}}. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely throughout the year, with July being the wettest month, when precipitation averages {{convert|107|mm|sp=us}}. The driest month is February, when precipitation averages only {{convert|9|mm|sp=us}}. Almost all precipitation during the Siberian winter falls as fluffy, dry snow.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

==Coat of arms==
{{No sources section|date=November 2023}}[[File:Coat of Arms of Irkutsk (Irkutsk oblast) (1790).png|thumb|The original version of the coat of arms]]

The [[coat of arms]] of Irkutsk features an old symbol of [[Transbaikal|Dauria]]: a [[Siberian tiger]] with a [[sable]] in his mouth. When the coat of arms was devised in 1690, the animal was described as a tiger ("babr", a bookish word of Persian derivation) with a [[sable]] in his mouth. This image had been used by the [[Yakutsk]] customs office from about 1642. It has its origin in a seal of the [[Siberia Khanate]] representing a sable and showcasing the fact that Siberia (or rather [[Yugra]]) was the main source of sable fur throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. (Actually, the English word "sable" is derived from the Russian "sobol").{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

By the mid-19th century, the word "babr" had fallen out of common usage, but it was still recorded in the [[Armorial of the Russian Empire]]. Furthermore, the tigers became extinct in this part of Siberia. In the 1870s, a high-placed French heraldist with a limited command of Russian assumed that "babr" was a misspelling of "bobr", the Russian word for "[[beaver]]", and changed the wording accordingly. This modification engendered a long dispute between the local authorities, who were so confused by the revised description that they started to depict the "babr" as a fabulous animal, half-tiger and half-beaver.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

The Soviets abolished the image altogether, but it was restored following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

The number of reported AIDS cases increased by more than 10,000% during the 1999–2000 period. Although the epidemic, which started in 1999, is reported to have slowed down, Irkutsk will lose tens of thousands of its working age population from 2010 onwards. This is one of the reasons Irkutsk's male life expectancy, at 53 years, is one of the lowest in all of Russia.

===Literature===
Irkutsk plays a crucial role in Jules Verne’s 1876 novel ''Michael Strogoff''. In the novel Strogoff is the heroic courier of the Czar Alexander II entrusted with delivering a critical dispatch to the Czar’s brother in Irkutsk with vital information about a rebellion brewing in Siberia. Irkutsk was home to Russian writer [[Valentin Rasputin]]; many of his novels and stories take place in the [[Angara River|Angara]] Valley. An essay on the cultural history of Irkutsk (and another one about the nearby Lake Baikal) is included in Rasputin's non-fiction collection [[Siberia, Siberia]], which is also available in an English translation. Irkutsk also figures prominently in descriptions by foreign travelers, including the so-called British "Blind Traveler" [[James Holman]], who was suspected of spying and conducted back forcibly to the frontiers of [[Poland]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}
