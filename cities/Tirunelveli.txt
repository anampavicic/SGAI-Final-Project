The [[Polygar War]], involving [[Palaiyakkarar]]s led by [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]] and forces of the British East India Company, was waged on the city's outskirts from 1797 to 1801.

Tirunelveli is administered by the [[Tirunelveli Municipal Corporation|Municipal Corporation]], established on 1 June 1994 by the [[Municipal Corporations Act|Municipal Corporation Act]]. The city covers an area of {{convert|189.9|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and holds a population of 473,637 in 2011. The total population after the inclusion of other municipalities is 968,984. Tirunelveli is well-connected by road and rail with the rest of Tamil Nadu and India. The nearest domestic airport is [[Tuticorin Airport|Thoothukudi Airport]]. The nearest international airports are [[Madurai International Airport]] and [[Trivandrum International Airport|Thiruvananthapuram International Airport]].

Tirunelveli has a number of historical monuments, with the [[Nellaiappar Temple]] being the most prominent. The city is also renowned throughout the state for a sweet called 'Irutu kadai [[Halva|halwa]]'.

==Etymology==
Tirunelveli is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the groves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Venu forest and hence called Venuvanam.{{sfn|Reddy| 2013| p= 10}} Tirunelveli was known in [[Sambandar]]'s seventh-century Saiva canonical work ''[[Tevaram]]'' as Thirunelveli.{{sfn|Moondram Thirumurai}} Swami Nellaiappar temple inscriptions say that [[Shiva]] (as Vrihivriteswara) descended in the form of a hedge and roof to save the paddy crop of a devotee. In Hindu legend, the place was known as Venuvana ("forest of bamboo") due to the presence of bamboo in the temple under which the deity is believed to have appeared.{{sfn|Ayyar| 1991| pp=498–499}} The early Pandyas named the city Thenpandya Nadu or Thenpandya Seemai, the Cholas Mudikonda Cholamandalam and the Nayaks Tirunelveli Seemai; it was known as Tinnelvelly by the British, and Tirunelveli after independence.{{sfn|Kanmony|2010|p=42}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=88}} The word ''Tirunelveli'' is derived from three Tamil words: ''thiru'', ''nel'' and ''veli'', meaning "sacred paddy hedge".{{sfn|P.|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=88}}

==History==
[[File:Nellaiappar temple pillar.JPG|250x250px|left|thumb|Sculpted pillar in Nellaiappar Temple (the largest temple in Tirunelveli)|alt=granite column with sculpture showing a person with a bow]]
Tirunelveli was under the rule of [[Pandian Empire|Pandya]] kings as their secondary capital; [[Madurai]] was the empire's primary capital.{{sfn| Stein|Johnson|Bayly|Richards|1989|p=79}} The Pandya dynasty in the region dates to several centuries before the [[Christian era]] from inscriptions by [[Asoka the great|Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) and mention in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the ''[[Brihat-Samhita]]'' and the writings of [[Megasthenes]] (350–290 CE). The province came under the rule of [[Cholas]] under [[Rajendra Chola I]] in 1064 CE; however, it is unclear whether he conquered the region or obtained it voluntarily.{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|pp=23–30}} Tirunelveli remained under the control of the Cholas until the early 13th century, when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital.{{sfn|Salma Ahmed|2011|p=26}}

The Nellaiappar temple was the royal shrine of the later Pandyas during the 13th and 14th centuries, and the city benefited from dams constructed with royal patronage during the period. After the death of [[Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I|Kulasekara Pandian]] (1268–1308), the region was occupied by Vijayangara rulers and Marava chieftains (palayakarars, or ''poligars'') during the 16th century. The Maravars occupied the western foothills and the Telugus, and the Kannadigas settled in the black-soil-rich eastern portion. Tirunelveli was the subsidiary capital of the [[Madurai Nayaks]];{{sfn| Stein|Johnson|Bayly|Richards|1989|p=79}} under [[Viswanatha Nayak]] (1529–64), the city was rebuilt about 1560. Inscriptions from the Nellaiappar temple indicate the generous contributions to the temple.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=379–380}} Nayak rule ended in 1736.

The region was captured by the subjects of the Mughal Empire such as [[Chanda Sahib]] (1740–1754) who declared himself "Nawab of Tinnevelly" as well as the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]].
In 1743 Nizam-ul-mulk, lieutenant of the [[Deccan Plateau]], displaced most of the Marathas from the region and Tirunelveli came under the rule of the [[Nawabs of Arcot]]. The original power lay in the hands of the ''polygars'', who were originally military chiefs of the Nayaks. The city was known as Nellai Cheemai, with ''Cheemai'' meaning "a developed foreign town".{{sfn|''The Hindu''|19 May 2007}}  The ''polygars'' built forts in the hills, had 30,000 troops and waged war among themselves. In 1755, the British government sent a mission under Major Heron and Mahfuz Khan which restored some order and bestowed the city to Mahfuz Khan. The ''poligars'' waged war against Mahfuz Khan seven miles from Tirunelveli, but were defeated. The failure of Mahfuz Khan led the East India Company to send Muhammed Yusuf for help. Khan became ruler, rebelled in 1763 and was hanged in 1764. In 1758, British troops under Colonel Fullarton reduced the ''polygar'' stronghold under [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]]. In 1797, the first Polygar war broke out between the British (under Major Bannerman) and the ''polygars'' (headed by Kattabomman). Some ''polygars'' (such as the head of Ettaiyapuram) aided the British; Kattabomman was defeated and hanged in his home province of Panchalaguruchi. Two years later, another rebellion became known as the Second Polygar War. Panchalaguruchi fell to the British, after stiff resistance. The [[Carnatic region]] came under British rule thereafter.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=375–379}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|pp=93–96}}{{sfn|W.|2002|pp=214–221}}

Tirunelveli District was formed on 1 September 1790 (Tirunelveli Day) by the East India Company (British) and named it as Tinnevelly district. The history of Tirunelveli was researched by [[Robert Caldwell]] (1814–91), a Christian [[missionary]] who visited the area.{{sfn|Caldwell|1989}}{{sfn|Daughrity|2005}}{{sfn|Mission Studies|2007}} After acquiring Tirunelveli from the Nawab of Arcot in 1801, the British anglicised its name to "Tinnevelly" and made it the headquarters of Tinnelvelli District. The administrative and military headquarters was located in [[Palayamkottai]] (anglicised as "Palankottah"), from which attacks against the ''polygars'' were launched. After independence both cities reverted to their original names, and Tirunelveli remained the capital of Tirunelveli district.  In early 1900s, parts of Tirunelveli district was made as Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts. In 1986, Tirunelveli district was further split into two districts for administrative purpose such as Chidambaranar (present-day [[Thoothukudi district]]) and Nellai-Kattabomman (later Tirunelveli-Kattabomman, present-day Tirunelveli districts). In 2019, [[Tenkasi]] was split from [[Tirunelveli District]] forming [[Tenkasi district|Tenkasi District]].

==Geography==
[[File:Agasthiyamalai range and Tirunelveli rainshadow.jpg|thumb|The [[Agasthiyamalai]] hills cut off Tirunelveli from the [[southwest monsoon]], creating a [[rainshadow]] region.|alt=image of hills with dark skyline]]
[[File:Central Veinthaan Kulam Panorama Tirunelveli Apr22 A7C 01848-49.jpg|thumb|Veinthaan Kulam, view from MGR Bus Stand]]
Tirunelveli is located at {{Coord|8|43|41.82|N|77|41|43.94|E|region:IN|display=inline}},{{sfn|Falling Rain Genomics}} and its average elevation is {{convert|47|m|ft}}. It is located at the southernmost tip of the Deccan plateau. The Tamirabarani River divides the city into the Tirunelveli quarter and the [[Palayamkottai]] area. The river (with its tributaries, such as the Chittar) is the major source of irrigation, and is fed by the northeast and southwest monsoons.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|p=215}} There are several small lakes of ponds (known as Kulam) in the city.  These include Nainar Kulam, Veinthan Kulam, Elantha Kulam and Udayarpetti Kulam. The area around the Tamirabarani River and the Chittar has five streams: Kodagan, Palayan, Tirunelveli, Marudur East and Marudur West, and the Chittar feeds fifteen other channels. The soil is friable, red and sandy.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=379–380}}

===Climate===
Tirunelveli has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (Köppen: ''BSh'') bordering on the relatively rare dry-summer [[tropical savanna climate]] (Köppen: ''As''), scattered irregularly across the world but relatively common in areas near the Laccadive Sea.

The climate of Tirunelveli is generally hot and humid. The average temperature during summer (March to June) ranges from {{convert|25|°C|°F}} to {{convert|41|°C|°F}}, and {{convert|18|°C|°F}} to {{convert|29|°C|°F}} during the rest of the year. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|680|mm|in}}. Maximum precipitation occurs during the [[northeast monsoon]] (October–December). Since the economy of the district is primarily based on agriculture, flooding of the Tamarabarani River or a fluctuation in monsoon rain has an immediate impact on the local economy. The primary crops grown in the region are paddy and cotton. Pineapples were introduced during the 16th century, [[Chili pepper|chilly]] and tobacco during the late 16th and potatoes during the early 17th centuries.{{sfn| Subrahmanyam|1990|p=28}} The most common tree is the [[Borassus|palmyra palm]], a raw material in cottage industries. Other trees grown in the region are [[teak]], wild jack, ''manjakadambu'', ''venteak'', ''vengai'', ''pillaimaruthu'', ''karimaruthu'' and bamboo. Livestock of the city and district comprises cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep and other animals in smaller numbers.{{sfn|Soundarapandian|2002| p=48}}
