'''Ternopil Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Тернопільська область|translit=Ternopiľśka oblasť}}), also referred to as '''Ternopilshchyna''' ({{langx|uk|Тернопільщина|translit=Ternopiľščyna}}) or '''Ternopillia''' ({{langx|uk|Тернопілля|translit=Ternopilľa}}), is an [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblast (province)]] of [[Ukraine]]. Its [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] is [[Ternopil]], through which flows the [[Seret (river)|Seret]], a tributary of the [[Dniester]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,021,713|punct=.}}

One of the natural wonders of the region are its [[cave]] complexes.<ref name=about_region>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaoJPF0G4RY Tell about Ukraine. Ternopil Oblast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101204144/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaoJPF0G4RY |date=2020-11-01 }}. 24 Kanal (youtube).</ref> Although Ternopil Oblast is among the smallest regions in Ukraine, over 100 caves have been discovered there.<ref name=about_region/> Scientists believe these are only 20% of all possible caves in the region.<ref name=about_region/> The biggest cave is [[Optymistychna Cave]].<ref name=about_region/> Measuring {{cvt|267|km}} in total length, it is the longest cave in [[Eurasia]] and the [[list of longest caves|fifth-longest in the world]].<ref name=about_region/> Twenty percent of the land in the region is [[chernozem]] soil.<ref name=about_region/>

Among its attractions, Ternopil Oblast has 34 castles.<ref name=about_region/> By at least one account, the most prominent is the [[Zbarazh Castle]] with fortifications that expand over {{cvt|16|ha}} and was the center of a 17th-century standoff between troops of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] and the army of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name=about_region/> The [[Dniester Canyon]] passes through the oblast; it is considered one of the wonders of Ukraine, stretching for {{cvt|250|km}}.<ref name=about_region/>

==Geography==

The oblast is located in [[Western Ukraine]] and has an area of {{cvt|13800|km2}}. It is situated at the western part of the [[Podilian Upland]], which is known for its rocky terrain. Among noticeable mountains there are the [[Kremenets Mountains]]. The oblast is also famous for its caves.

One of the major rivers in the country [[Dniester]] forms southern and southwestern borders of Ternopil Oblast with the adjacent [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]]. Its tributaries that flow through the oblast include [[Zbruch River|Zbruch]], [[Seret River|Seret]], and [[Strypa River|Strypa]] among just a few of them. The [[Seret River]] (not to be confused with [[Siret River|Siret]] nor [[Seret River (Drohobych)|Seret]]) is a left tributary of the Dniester flowing through the oblast administrative center, i.e. [[Ternopil]].

Ternopil Oblast is one of two oblasts in [[West Ukraine]] that do not have an international border. It is surrounded by five other [[oblasts of Ukraine]]: [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] – to the south, [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]] – to the southwest, [[Lviv Oblast]] – to the northwest, [[Rivne Oblast]] – to the north, and [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]] – to the east.

From the 12th century the area belonged to [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Galicia–Volhynia]] until Galicia–Volhynia was incorporated into the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the 14th century.

In 1569 Poland and Lithuania united into the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

From the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772 until the end of [[World War I]] the area which would become Ternopil Oblast was mostly part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], a possession of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Austrian Empire]] and finally [[Austria-Hungary]]. In Ukraine today, there are three oblasts (provinces) that largely formed the eastern part of Galicia and Lodomeria until 1918. [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]] was entirely contained in the kingdom, as was the vast majority of [[Lviv Oblast]] (only a few small areas and villages near [[Sokal]] were not). The southern and central parts of Ternopil Oblast were within the kingdom while the northern parts (pre-2020 raions: [[Kremenets Raion|Kremenets]], [[Shumsk Raion|Shumsk]], [[Lanivtsi Raion|Lanivtsi]] and the northern half of [[Zbarazh Raion|Zbarazh]]; post-2020: Kremenets Raion and small parts of [[Ternopil Raion]]) remained with Poland Lithuania; from 1795 ([[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]]) they belonged to the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Volhynian Governorate]] (specifically the [[Kremenetsky Uyezd]]). During the [[Napoleonic wars]] the area around Ternopil was annexed by Russia in the 1809 [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] becoming the {{ill|Tarnopolsky Krai|de|Tarnopoler Kreis|pl|Kraj Tarnopolski|ru|Тарнопольский край|uk|Тернопільський край}}; it was ceded back to Austria in 1815 ([[Congress of Vienna]]). The Tarnopolsky Krai roughly covered the eastern two-thirds of the post-2022 Ternopil Raion and the Chortkiv Raion up to the [[Strypa]]; in pre-2020 terms it corresponded with the cities of Ternopil and Chortkiv and the Borshchiv, Chortkiv, Husiatyn, Pidvolochysk, Terebovlia, Ternopil and Zalishchyky raions, the southern half of Zbarazh raion, the eastern and northern parts of Buchach raion and some eastern parts of Zboriv and Kozova raions.

From 1917 the formerly Russian part came under the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] ([[Ukrainian State]] April–December 1918; also claimed by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets]]/[[Ukrainian Soviet Republic]] December 1917–April 1918 and the [[Ukrainian SSR]] from March 1919); from 1918 the formerly Austrian part was controlled by the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (nominally part of the Ukrainian People's Republic from 22 January 1919) but ultimately the whole area fell to the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1921 following the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], [[Polish–Ukrainian War]] and [[Polish–Soviet War]]. The formerly Austrian parts became part of the [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]], while the formerly Russian parts became part of the [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Volhynian Voivodeship]], specifically the {{ill|Krzemieniec county|pl|Powiat krzemieniecki|uk|Кременецький повіт (II Річ Посполита)}}. The southern pre-2020 raions of Ternopil Oblast were partially coterminous with [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia and Lodomeria's districts/counties]] and Interwar Poland's counties.

The oblast was created during the [[World War II|Second World War]] when both [[Nazi Germany]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded]] [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. Due to the Polish national policy in the area ([[Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia (1930)|Pacification action]]), many people favored the Soviet invasion of [[Eastern Galicia]] at first. However, soon thereafter, the Soviet security agencies started a [[witch hunt]] among nationally oriented members of Ukrainian resistance who emigrated to Poland after the [[Soviet-Ukrainian War]] as well as other reasons. Many of local population were exiled to [[Siberia]] regardless of their ethnic background. On December 4, 1939, the voivodeship division in the [[West Ukraine]] was abolished and replaced with the existing Soviet administrative division oblast. Ternopil Oblast (originally Tarnopol Oblast) was established based mostly on the Tarnopol Voivodeship and southern portions of the [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Volhynian Voivodeship]].

During the invasion of the Soviet Union by [[Nazi Germany]], Ternopil became an object of fierce fighting between Soviet and German forces because of its importance as a rail transportation hub. During German occupation, the region (except for its Volhynian portion) became part of the [[District of Galicia]] and transferred to administration by the [[General Government]]. After the war, a destroyed residential section of Ternopil, near the river, was turned into an artificial lake rather than being rebuilt. Additionally, upon annexation to the Soviet Union's [[Ukrainian SSR]], most ethnic Poles in the region were forcibly relocated to Poland, whose national borders had shifted far to the west. The area of the former Polish voivodeship was expanded by adding territory in the north, though the westernmost parts were transferred to the [[Lviv oblast]]. After 1945 Soviet authorities also encouraged ethnic Russians to settle in territories newly annexed to the Soviet Union, including the Ternopil oblast, though western Ukraine remained considerably less Russian than eastern Ukraine.

As Ukraine achieved independence in the 1990s, western Ukraine remained the heartland of Ukrainian political and cultural nationalism, and the political affiliations of Ternopil voters reflected that viewpoint. In the first elections after independence, the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]] was the leading party in the oblast. A majority of oblast voters supported the Ukrainian nationalist-oriented [[Electoral Bloc Yuliya Tymoshenko]] in the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election]]. Over 88% of voters supported [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] of the [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]] in the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]].

By 2005, the population of the oblast had grown to roughly 225,000, consisting primarily of ethnic Ukrainians with a large Russian or [[Russian language|Russian-speaking]] minority. The city of Ternopil has important institutions of higher education, including two teacher's colleges, an international medical school with instruction in English, and one of three economics institutes in Ukraine.

[[File:PochaevInside.jpg|thumb|200px|Pochaiv Monastery]]
The religion of the majority is [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic]], though there is a notable Orthodox presence and a small Protestant minority. Many churches which were closed or destroyed under Soviet rule have rebuilt since independence. The local Jewish community, which was very large before 1939, disappeared in the [[Holocaust]] and was not reestablished after 1945. There are no active synagogues in the oblast and only a few isolated individuals affiliating with the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]].

==Population==

===National composition===
The population is predominantly [[Ukrainophone]] and about 98% consider themselves [[Ukrainians]]. Among the biggest minorities are [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Russians]] who combine 1.6% of the total population. Most of the population is bilingual and the [[Ukrainian language]] is accepted in daily communications. The estimated population is {{Ua-pop-est2020|1,038,694}}

In historical comparison, before [[World War II]] national composition was very different and according to the [[1931 Polish Census]] Ukrainians were a slight majority in the [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]] at 54.8%, while there was almost no [[Russians]]. On the other hand, the [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Jewish people|Jewish]] population decreased drastically from 36.6% and 8.4% respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Economy and transportation==
[[File:Viaduk. Terebovlia. Plebanivka.jpg|thumb|Bridge near Terebovlia]]
The economy is predominantly agriculturally oriented. Among industries, there is a well developed food industry particularly sugar production, alcohol, and dairy (such as butter). There is also number of factories such as "Vatra" (lighting equipment), Ternopil Harvester Plant, "Orion" (radio communication) among a few.

Ternopil Oblast has an adequate network of highways, while the city of [[Ternopil]] is located at the intersection of main European corridors along the [[European route E50|E50]] and [[European route E85|E85]] highways. There is a small airport in [[Ternopil]] ([[Ternopil Airport]]) which however mostly is used for charter flights. There is a well developed railroad network which is a part of the [[Lviv Railways]]. Water transportation is very limited and mostly along the [[Dniester River]].

'''Before 18 July 2020'''
Before the 2020 administrative reform, Ternopil Oblast was administratively subdivided into 17 [[raions of Ukraine|raions]] ([[district]]s), as well as 1 city ([[municipality]]) which is directly subordinate to the oblast government: [[Ternopil]], the administrative center of the oblast. The average area of a raion was around {{cvt|808|km2|sqmi}}, the biggest one was [[Terebovlia Raion]] covering {{cvt|1130|km2|sqmi}} and the smallest one - [[Pidhaitsi Raion]] with {{cvt|496|km2|sqmi}}. The average population number was around 50.6 thousands which is just below the national average.
