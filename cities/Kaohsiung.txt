Founded in the [[17th century]] as a small trading village named '''Takau''' (or '''Takow'''), the city has since grown into the political and economic center of [[southern Taiwan]], with key industries such as manufacturing, [[steel-making]], [[oil refining]], [[freight transport]] and [[shipbuilding]]. It is classified as a "Gamma −" level [[global city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The World According to GaWC 2020 |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |publisher=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Research Network |access-date=31 August 2020 |archive-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824031341/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |url-status=live }}</ref> with some of the most prominent infrastructures in Taiwan.

[[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] immigrants to the area during the 16th and 17th centuries called the region ''Takau'' ({{zh|c=打狗 |poj=Táⁿ-káu|links=no}}). The surface meaning of the associated [[Chinese characters]] was "beat the dog". According to one theory, the name Takau originates from the aboriginal [[Siraya language]] and translates as "bamboo forest". According to another theory, the name evolved via [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from the name of the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] tribe, who inhabited the area at the time of European and Hoklo settlement. The Makatao is considered by some to be part of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-04-23 |title=Siraya activists slam ministry over letter - Taipei Times |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/04/23/2003441794 |access-date=2021-02-09 |website=www.taipeitimes.com |archive-date=12 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412200101/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/04/23/2003441794 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonization]] of southern Taiwan, the area was known as ''Tancoia'' to Europeans for a period of about three decades.{{Specify|reason=Which three decades?|date=January 2019}} In 1662, the Dutch were expelled by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], founded by Ming loyalists of [[Koxinga]]. His son, [[Zheng Jing]], renamed the village ''Banlian-chiu'' ({{zh|t=萬年州|poj=Bān-liân-chiu|links=no|l=ten-thousand-year state (''[[Zhou (country subdivision)|zhou]]'')}}) in 1664.

The name of "Takau" was restored in the late 1670s, when the town expanded drastically with immigrants from [[mainland China]] and was kept through Taiwan's cession to the Japanese Empire in 1895. In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa [[James W. Davidson]] relates that "Takow" was already a well-known name in English.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |author-link=James W.

While the new name had quite a different surface meaning, its pronunciation in Japanese sounded more or less the same as the old name spoken in [[Hokkien]].

After Taiwan was ceded to the Republic of China, the Chinese characters did not change, but adapted to Mandarin pronunciation, thus the official romanization became Kaohsiung ({{zh|w=Kao¹-hsiung²|p=Gāoxióng}}), derived from the [[Wade–Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation for {{lang|zh|高雄}}.

The name ''Takau'' remains the official name of the city in [[Formosan languages|Austronesian languages]] of Taiwan such as [[Rukai language|Rukai]], although these are not widely spoken in the city. The name also remains popular locally in the naming of businesses, associations, and events.

[[File:Harbor Takao.jpg|thumb|Port of Ta-kau (1893)]]
The written history of Kaohsiung can be traced back to the early 17th century, through archaeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7,000 years ago. Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] people of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe, who settled on what they named Takau Isle (translated to 打狗嶼 by Ming Chinese explorers); "Takau" meaning "bamboo forest" in the aboriginal language.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-04 |title=Kaohsiung Celebrates 100th Anniversary - A Personal Take |url=https://thetaiwantimes.com/kaohsiung-celebrates-100th-anniversary-a-personal-take/ |access-date=2021-02-09 |website=The Taiwan Times |language=en-US |archive-date=4 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210104085102/https://thetaiwantimes.com/kaohsiung-celebrates-100th-anniversary-a-personal-take/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:Makatao.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the Makatao people during the [[Qing empire]]]]
The earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4,700–5,200 years ago. Most of the discovered remnants were located in the hills surrounding [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]]. Artifacts were found at [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan]], Longquan Temple, Taoziyuan, [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]], Houjing, Fudingjin and [[Fengbitou Archaeological Site|Fengbitou]]. The prehistoric [[Dabenkeng culture|Dapenkeng]], [[Niuchouzi Culture|Niuchouzi]], [[Tahu Culture|Dahu]], and [[Niaosung Culture|Niaosong]] civilizations were known to inhabit the region. Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal [[Makatao people|Makatao]] civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter. Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved. Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies. Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present. The pronunciation of Kaohsiung (Takao) in Japanese is similar to Takau (Takau), so the local flavor of Takao was renamed Kaohsiung.

The first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by [[Chen Di]], a member of [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and [[Penghu]] of pirates. In his report on the "Eastern Barbarian Lands" (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:

{{blockquote|It is unknown when the barbarians ([[Taiwanese aborigines]]) arose on this island in the ocean beyond [[Penghu]], but they are present at Keeong Harbor (nowaday's [[Budai, Chiayi]]), the bay of Galaw ([[Anping, Tainan]]), Laydwawan ([[Tainan City]]), Yaw Harbor ([[Cheting District|Cheting, Kaohsiung]]), Takau Isle (Kaohsiung City), Little Tamsui ([[Donggang, Pingtung]]), Siangkeykaw ([[Puzi]], Chiayi), Gali forest ([[Jiali District]], Tainan), the village of Sabah ([[Tamsui, Taipei]]), and Dwabangkang ([[Bali District|Bali, New Taipei City]]).}}

===Dutch Formosa===
Taiwan became a [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colony]] in 1624, after the [[Dutch East India Company]] was ejected from [[Penghu]] by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces. At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan. The Dutch named the place ''Tankoya'', and the harbor ''Tancoia''. The Dutch missionary [[François Valentijn]] named Takau Mountain "Ape Berg", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century. ''Tankoia'' was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping, Tainan]]) by sail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William |author-link=William Campbell (missionary) |title=Formosa under the Dutch: described from contemporary records, with explanatory notes and a bibliography of the island |year=1903 |publisher=Kegan Paul |location=London |oclc=644323041 |chapter=Explanatory Notes |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/formosaunderdut01campgoog#page/n554/mode/2up |page=548|isbn=9789576380839 }}</ref> At the time, a wide shallow bay existed there, sufficient for small vessels. However, constant [[Siltation|silting]] changed the coastline.

During this time, Taiwan was divided into five administrative districts, with Takau belonging to the southernmost district. In 1630, the first large scale immigration of [[Han Chinese]] to Taiwan began due to famine in [[Fujian]], with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:2010 07 鳳山縣舊城南門圓環.jpg|thumb|South Gate of Fongshan County]]
In 1684, the [[Qing dynasty]] annexed [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Taiwan]] and renamed the town Fongshan County ({{zh|c=鳳山縣|p=Fèngshān Xiàn}}), considering it a part of [[Taiwan Prefecture]]. It was first opened as a port during the 1680s and subsequently prospered fairly for generations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoteltravel.com/taiwan/kaohsiung/history-of-kaohsiung.htm |publisher=HotelTravel.com |year=1999 |title=History of Kaohsiung |access-date=2 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053547/http://www.hoteltravel.com/taiwan/kaohsiung/history-of-kaohsiung.htm |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Japanese rule===
{{main|Takao Prefecture}}
[[File:Kaohsiung Station and the city 2017-10-30.jpg|thumb|[[Kaohsiung Vision Museum|Old Kaohsiung Train Station]], built during Japanese rule of Taiwan]]
In 1895, Taiwan was ceded to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] as part of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. Administrative control of the city was moved from New Fongshan Castle to the Fongshan Sub-District of {{nihongo||臺南廳|Tainan Chō}}. In November 1901, twenty ''chō'' were established in total; {{nihongo4||鳳山廳|Hōzan Chō}} was established nearby. In 1909, Hōzan Chō was abolished, and Takow was merged into Tainan Chō.

In 1920, during the tenure of 8th Governor-General [[Den Kenjirō]], districts were abolished in favor of prefectures. Thus the city was administered as {{nihongo4|Takao City|高雄市|Takao-shi}} under [[Takao Prefecture]].

The Japanese developed Takao, especially the harbor that became the foundation of Kaohsiung to be a port city. Takao was then systematically modernized and connected to the end of [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|North-South Railway]]. Forming a north–south regional economic corridor from Taipei to Kaohsiung in the 1930s, Japan's Southward Policy set Kaohsiung to become an industrial center.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://taiwaninsight.org/2019/02/09/taiwans-cultural-plurality-and-immigration-policy/ |title=Taiwan's Cultural Plurality and Immigration Policy |last1=Lin |first1=Ji-ping |date=2019-02-09 |website=Taiwan Insight |language=en |access-date=2020-02-26 |archive-date=26 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226195149/https://taiwaninsight.org/2019/02/09/taiwans-cultural-plurality-and-immigration-policy/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]] was also developed starting from 1894.

New industries such as refinery, machinery, shipbuilding and cementing were also introduced.

Before and during [[World War II]] it handled a growing share of Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan, and was also a major base for Japan's campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Extremely ambitious plans for the construction of a massive modern port were drawn up. Toward the end of the war, the Japanese promoted some industrial development at Kaohsiung, establishing an aluminum industry based on the abundant [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] produced by the [[Sun Moon Lake]] project in the mountains.

The city was heavily bombed by [[Task Force 38]] and [[Far East Air Force (United States)|FEAF]] during World War II between 1944 and 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-11-12 |title=US bombing of Taiwan and Han's ignorance - Taipei Times |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2019/11/12/2003725674 |access-date=2021-02-09 |website=www.taipeitimes.com |archive-date=12 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210212234122/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2019/11/12/2003725674 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Republic of China===
After control of Taiwan was [[History of Taiwan since 1945|handed over from Japan]] to the government of the [[Republic of China]] on 25 October 1945, Kaohsiung City and [[Kaohsiung County]] were established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] and a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] of [[Taiwan Province]] respectively on 25 December 1945. The official romanization of the name came to be "Kaohsiung", based on the [[Wade–Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] reading of the [[kanji]] name.<ref>[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 What's in changing a name?] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20070630101000/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 |date=30 June 2007 }} Taiwan Journal Vol. XXVI No. 19 May 15, 2009 "...while name Kaohsiung is technically the Mandarin pronunciation of the Japanese written version of a Holo Taiwanese rendition of an old aboriginal name..."</ref> Kaohsiung City then consisted of 10 [[District (Taiwan)|districts]], which were [[Gushan District|Gushan]], [[Lingya District|Lianya]] (renamed "Lingya" in 1952), [[Nanzih District|Nanzih]], [[Qianjin District, Kaohsiung|Cianjin]], [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]], [[Cijin District, Kaohsiung|Cijin]], [[Sanmin District|Sanmin]], [[Sinsing District, Kaohsiung|Sinsing]], [[Yancheng District, Kaohsiung|Yancheng]], and [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]].

During this time, Kaohsiung developed rapidly. The port, badly damaged in [[World War II]], was restored. It also became a fishing port for boats sailing to Filipino and Indonesian waters. Largely because of its climate, Kaohsiung overtook [[Keelung]] as Taiwan's major port. Kaohsiung also surpassed Tainan to become the second largest city of Taiwan in the late 1970s and Kaohsiung City was upgraded from a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] to [[special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] on 1 July 1979, by the [[Executive Yuan]] with a total of 11 districts.<ref>{{cite news |date=1 February 2011 |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187 |title=Rezoning Taiwan |publisher=Taiwan Today |access-date=9 December 2020 |archive-date=12 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112165942/https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187 |url-status=live }}</ref> The additional district is [[Siaogang District]], which was annexed from Siaogang Township of [[Kaohsiung County]].

The [[Kaohsiung Incident]], where the government suppressed a commemoration of International [[Human Rights Day]], occurred on 10 December 1979. Since then, Kaohsiung gradually grew into a political center of the [[Pan-Green Coalition|Pan-Green]] population of Taiwan, in opposition to [[Taipei]] where the majority population is [[Kuomintang]] supporters.

The city sits on the southwestern coast of Taiwan facing the [[Taiwan Strait]], bordering [[Tainan City]] to the northwest, [[Chiayi]] and [[Nantou County]] to the north, [[Taitung County]] to its east and [[Pingtung County]] to the south and southeast. The downtown areas are centered on Kaohsiung Harbor with [[Cijin District, Kaohsiung|Cijin Island]] on the other side of the harbor acting as a natural [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. The [[Love River]] (Ai River) flows into the harbor through the Old City and downtown. Zuoying Military Harbor lies to the north of Kaohsiung Harbor and the city center. Kaohsiung's natural landmarks include [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Ape Hill]] and [[Mount Banping]].

Located about a degree south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Kaohsiung has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''), near to a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'')<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Kaohsiung City (Republic of China (Taiwan)) |url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/republic-of-china/kaohsiung-city/kaohsiung-city-1054/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221000525/https://en.climate-data.org/asia/republic-of-china/kaohsiung-city/kaohsiung-city-1054/ |archive-date=21 February 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> with monthly mean temperatures between {{cvt|20|and|29|°C|°F}} and relative humidity ranging between 71 and 81%.

Kaohsiung's warm climate is very much dictated by its low latitude and its exposure to warm sea temperatures year-round, with the [[Kuroshio Current]] passing by the coast of southern Taiwan,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yXHISDkQ0DA/T1NR7IQM8UI/AAAAAAAABY8/oxDvX83yHpQ/s400/%E6%B0%B4%E6%BA%AB.jpg |title=Taiwan sea temperatures of February 2012 |publisher=Central Weather Bureau |access-date=20 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326052323/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yXHISDkQ0DA/T1NR7IQM8UI/AAAAAAAABY8/oxDvX83yHpQ/s400/%E6%B0%B4%E6%BA%AB.jpg |archive-date=26 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Central Mountain Range]] on the northeast blocking out the cool northeastern winds during the winter. The city, therefore, has a noticeably warmer climate than nearby cities located at similar latitudes such as [[Hong Kong]], [[Guangzhou]] as well as various cities further south in northern [[Vietnam]], such as [[Hanoi]]. Although the climate is classified as tropical, Kaohsiung has a defined cooler season unlike most other cities in Asia classified with this climate but located closer to the equator such as [[Singapore]] or [[Manila]]. Daily maximum temperature typically exceeds {{cvt|30|C}} during the warmer season (April to November) and {{cvt|25|C}} during the cooler season (December to March), with the exception when cold fronts strike during the winter months, when the daily mean temperature of the city can drop between 10 and 12&nbsp;°C depending on the strength of the cold front. Also, besides the high temperatures occurring during the usual summer months, daytime temperatures of inland districts of the city can often exceed {{cvt|33|C}} from mid-March to late April before the onset of the [[monsoon season]], with clear skies and southwesterly airflows. Average annual rainfall is around {{cvt|1885|mm}}, focused primarily from June to August. At more than 2,210 hours of bright sunshine, the city is one of the sunniest areas in Taiwan.<ref name=CWB/>

As an exporting center, Kaohsiung serves the agricultural interior of southern Taiwan, as well as the mountains of the southeast. Major [[raw material]] exports include rice, sugar, bananas, [[pineapple]]s, peanuts (groundnuts) and [[citrus fruit]]s. The {{cvt|2200|ha|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Linhai Industrial Park]], on the waterfront, was completed in the mid-1970s and includes a [[steel mill]], [[shipyard]], [[petrochemical]] complex, and other industries. The city has an [[oil refinery]], aluminum and cement works, [[fertilizer]] factories, sugar refineries, brick and tile works, canning factories, salt-manufacturing factories, and [[papermaking]] plants. Designated an [[export-processing zone]] in the late 1970s, Kaohsiung also attracted foreign investment to process locally purchased raw materials for export.

In 2020, Kaohsiung's [[land reclamation]] project in the Port of Kaohsiung was completed, equivalent to 16 of [[Daan Forest Park|Taipei's Daan Forest Parks]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-03-09 |title=Kaohsiung port project completed - Taipei Times |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/03/09/2003732354 |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=www.taipeitimes.com |archive-date=12 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220712131628/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/03/09/2003732354 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Natural attractions====
Kaohsiung city includes a wide range of different natural attractions due to its large size and geographical variation, as it is bordered by the [[Central Mountain Range]] in the northeast and the warm [[South China Sea]] to the west and southwest. The year-round warm climate allows [[coral reefs]] to grow along the coasts around [[Kaohsiung Harbor]], with [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan Mountain]] being a small mountain completely made up of coral reefs and [[calcium carbonate]], while the mountainous districts in the northeast include Taiwan's highest mountain, [[Yushan (mountain)|Yushan]].

Kaohsiung is home to many [[Night markets in Taiwan|night markets]], such as [[Jin-Zuan Night Market]], [[Liuhe Night Market]], [[Ruifeng Night Market]], [[Zhonghua Street Night Market]], and the [[Kaisyuan Night Market]]. Other attractions include the [[Cijin Tianhou Temple]], [[Formosa Boulevard metro station|Dome of Light of Kaohsiung MRT's Formosa Boulevard Station]], the [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] and the [[Tower of Light]] of [[Sanmin District]].

[[Wet market|Traditional "wet" markets]] have long been the source of meat, fish, and produce for many residents. With the arrival of Western-style [[supermarkets]] in the 1980s and 1990s, such markets have encountered fierce competition. In 1989, the global leader in hypermarkets, [[Carrefour]], entered Asia, opening its first store in Kaohsiung. Due to the success of its Taiwan operation, the French retailer expanded throughout the country and Asia. Jean-Luc Chéreau, the general manager in Taiwan from 1993 to 1999, used this newfound understanding of Chinese culture and ways of doing business with Chinese customers to lead its China expansion starting in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www1.ximb.ac.in/users/fac/visiting/vfac.nsf/23e5e39594c064ee852564ae004fa010/b6eccfba375c3a306525726000507c80/$FILE/4.%20carrefour%20china%20int.pdf |title=Lessons from a global retailer: An interview with the president of Carrefour China |last=Child |first=Peter |date=2006 |access-date=26 February 2020 |archive-date=2 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802203152/http://www1.ximb.ac.in/users/fac/visiting/vfac.nsf/23e5e39594c064ee852564ae004fa010/b6eccfba375c3a306525726000507c80/$FILE/4.%20carrefour%20china%20int.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> As of February 2020, Carrefour has opened 137 hypermarkets and supermarkets in Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.carrefour.com.tw/store.html |title=分店資訊 |website=Carrefour 家樂福 |access-date=26 February 2020 |archive-date=26 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226201546/https://www.carrefour.com.tw/store.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite the fierce competition from "Westernized" supermarkets, Taiwan's traditional markets and mom-and-pop stores remain "one of the most popular retail formats for many Asian families when they purchase daily food items and basic household goods."<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Yu-Chih |last2=Huang |first2=Chi-tsun |last3=Tsai |first3=Kuen-Hung |date=2015 |title=How do wet markets still survive in Taiwan? |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/0007-070X.htm |journal=British Food Journal |volume=117 |pages=234–256 |doi=10.1108/BFJ-05-2013-0136 |via=Emerald Insight |access-date=26 February 2020 |archive-date=10 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230410221725/https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/issn/0007-070X |url-status=live }}</ref>

Coffee cafes have become famous and numerous in the city. With the arrival of Western-style chains many new local cafes have opened in the recent years.  Cafe Hondo has established itself for good espressos.

===Languages===
{{see also|Languages of Taiwan|}}
The majority of those living in Kaohsiung can communicate in both [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and  [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].  Some of the elderly who grew up during the Japanese colonization of Taiwan can communicate in Japanese, while most of the younger population have basic English skills.

Since the spread of Standard Chinese after the [[Chinese Civil War|Nationalist Government retreated to Taiwan in 1949]], [[Hakka Chinese]] and various [[Formosan languages]] are gradually no longer spoken with the new generation and many Formosan languages are therefore classified as [[Moribund language|moribund]] or [[endangered languages]] by the United Nations. Nowadays, only elder Hakka people mostly living in [[Meinong District|Meinong]], [[Liouguei District|Liouguei]], [[Shanlin District|Shanlin]] and [[Jiasian District|Jiasian]] districts can communicate in Hakka and elder Taiwanese aborigines living mostly in the rural districts of [[Namasia District|Namasia]] and [[Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung|Taoyuan]] can communicate with the aboriginal languages. The Taiwanese government has established special affairs committees for both the Aboriginals and the Hakkas to protect their language, culture, and minority rights.

The religious population of Kaohsiung is mainly divided into five main religious groups: [[Buddhists]], [[Taoists]], [[Muslim]] and [[Christians]] ([[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]). {{As of|2015}}, Kaohsiung City has 1,481 temples, the second highest in Taiwan after [[Tainan]]. Kaohsiung also has 306 churches.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Lee Hsin-fang |first2=Jake |last2=Chung |date=15 July 2015 |page=5 |title=Tainan has most of nation's 12,106 temples |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623092 |newspaper=Taipei Times |access-date=15 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715111332/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623092 |archive-date=15 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Buddhism===
Buddhism is one of the major religions in Taiwan, with over 35% of Taiwan's population identifying as Buddhists.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yu |first=Pei-Lin |title=How Taiwanese death rituals have adapted for families living in the US |url=http://theconversation.com/how-taiwanese-death-rituals-have-adapted-for-families-living-in-the-us-131539 |access-date=2021-05-15 |website=The Conversation |date=21 July 2020 |language=en |archive-date=15 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515212403/https://theconversation.com/how-taiwanese-death-rituals-have-adapted-for-families-living-in-the-us-131539 |url-status=live }}</ref> The same applies to Kaohsiung city. Kaohsiung also hosts the largest [[Buddhist temple]] in Taiwan, the [[Fo Guang Shan Monastery]] with its [[Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum]]. There are also other famous Buddhist temples such as [[Fengshan Longshan Temple]] and [[Hong Fa Temple]].

===Taoism===
Around 33% of the Taiwanese population are Taoists, making it the second largest religion of Taiwan. Most people who believe in Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the sea goddess known as Tian Shang Sheng Mu ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|天上聖母}}) or [[Mazu]], who is variously [[syncretized]] as a [[Taoist immortal]] or embodiment of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]]. Her temple on Cijin Island, [[Chi Jin Mazu Temple]], is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed the center of the city's early settlement.<ref name=herry>{{citation |contribution-url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/Heritage.aspx?KeyID=740a98f3-eb1e-4e3b-aca2-29561ae6cd51 |contribution=Tianhou Temple at Cihou |url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |title=Official site |year=2008 |publisher=Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the Kaohsiung City Government |location=Kaohsiung |access-date=16 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006000307/http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=dead}}. {{in lang|zh}}{{nbsp}}& {{in lang|en}}</ref> There are also other prominent Taoist temples such as [[Fengshan Tiangong Temple]], dedicated to the [[Jade Emperor]], [[Cih Ji Palace]], dedicated to [[Baosheng Dadi|Bao Sheng Da Di]], [[Zhouzi Qingshui Temple|Qing Shui Temple]], dedicated to [[Qingshui (monk)|Qing Shui Zu Shi]] and [[Gushan Daitian Temple]] dedicated to [[Wang Ye worship]].

===Christianity===
Christianity is a minority religion in Taiwan. It was first brought onto the island when the Dutch and Spanish colonized Taiwan during the 17th century, mostly to the aboriginals. Kaohsiung currently hosts around 56,000 Christians.

===Islam===
Besides the majority population of Buddhists and Taoists, Kaohsiung also includes a rather tiny population of [[Muslims]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled [[mainland China]] with the [[Kuomintang]] government to Taiwan.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Charette |first=Rick |date=2020-04-13 |title=The Muslim Experience in Taipei |url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/133739 |access-date=2021-05-15 |website=The News Lens International Edition |language=en |archive-date=27 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227101020/https://international.thenewslens.com/article/133739 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the 1980s, another few thousand Muslims from [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]], who are mostly descendants of [[Nationalist Chinese|Nationalist]] soldiers who fled [[Yunnan]] as a result of the communist takeover, migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life, resulting in an increase of Muslim population within the country.<ref name=":1" /> More recently, with the rise of Indonesian workers working in Taiwan, an estimated number of 88,000 Indonesian Muslims currently live in the country, in addition to the existing 53,000 Taiwanese Muslims. Combining all demographics, Taiwan hosts around 140,000 Muslims, with around 25,000 living in Kaohsiung. [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] is the largest mosque in Kaohsiung and the main gathering site of Muslims within the city.

Sometimes Kaohsiung used to be seen as the political opposite of Taipei. While northern Taiwan leans towards the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] in the state-level elections, southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung, leaned towards the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] since the late 1990s. [[Frank Hsieh]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was reelected twice as Mayor of Kaohsiung, where he was widely credited for transforming the city from an industrial sprawl into an attractive modern metropolis. Hsieh resigned from the office of mayor to take up the office of [[Premier of the Republic of China]] in 2005. The [[2005–06 Taiwanese local elections|municipal election, held on 9 December 2006]], resulted in a victory for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s candidate [[Chen Chu]], the first elected female mayor of [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] in Taiwan, defeating her [[Kuomintang]] rival and former deputy mayor, Huang Chun-ying. As of 12 June 2020, the mayor of Kaohsiung City is [[Chen Chi-mai]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lin |first=Sean |date=12 June 2020 |title=Yang to Become Acting Kaohsiung Mayor: Source |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2020/06/12/2003738078 |work=[[Taipei Times]] |page=1 |access-date=5 October 2022 |archive-date=17 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220817155711/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2020/06/12/2003738078 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Transportation==
===Port of Kaohsiung===
{{main|Port of Kaohsiung}}
[[File:Ddm 2004 028 Kaohsiung Harbor.jpg|thumb|Northern portion of Kaohsiung harbor viewed from Cijin island lighthouse hill]]

A major port, through which pass most of Taiwan's marine imports and exports, is located in the city but is not managed by the city government. Instead, it is administered by Kaohsiung Port Authority, under the Ministry of Transportation. There is a push for Kaohsiung City to annex the Port of Kaohsiung to facilitate better regional planning.

Also known as the "Harbour Capital" of Taiwan, Kaohsiung has always had a strong link with the ocean and maritime transportation. [[Ferries]] play a key role in everyday transportation, especially for transportation across the harbor. With five terminals and 23 berths, the ''Port of Kaohsiung'' is Taiwan's largest [[container port]] and the 13th largest in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports |title=Top 50 World Container Ports {{!}} World Shipping Council|website=www.worldshipping.org |access-date=4 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115163646/http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports |archive-date=15 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007 the port reached its handling capacity with a record trade volume of {{TEU|10.2&nbsp;million|first=yes}}.<ref name="LLDCN">{{cite news |last=Dale |first=Jamie |title=Kaohsiung container port hits full capacity |work=Lloyd's List Daily Commercial News |page=16 |publisher=Informa Australia |date=17 January 2008}}</ref> A new container terminal is under construction, increasing future handling capacity by {{TEU|2 million}} by 2013.<ref name="LLDCN" />

===Kaohsiung International Airport===
[[File:高雄國際機場.JPG|thumb|[[Kaohsiung International Airport]]]]

Kaohsiung City is also home to Taiwan's second-largest international airport, the [[Kaohsiung International Airport]], located in [[Siaogang District]] near the city's center. It is one of the three major international airports of Taiwan, serving passengers of the entire southern and southeastern part of the country. However, the size of the airport is relatively small, with short runways compared to other major airports of Taiwan due to its age and its location near the city center, making it impossible for large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A380]] to land at the airport. As a result, plans for work to begin on a new terminal is expected to start in 2023, and could handle up to 16.5 million passengers once complete.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.flightglobal.com/air-transport/kaohsiung-airport-expansion-to-start-in-2023-as-taiwan-reopens-to-travellers/150522.article | title=Kaohsiung airport expansion to start in 2023 as Taiwan reopens to travellers }}</ref>
