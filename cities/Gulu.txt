==History==
During the British Bagool rule in the 18th and 19th centuries, northern Uganda was less developed compared to the rest of the country. The people were conscripted into the army and the police, with many sent to fight in the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second World Wars]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Social Torture: The Case of Northern Uganda 1986-2006 | page=42 | first=Chris | last=Dolan | date=2009}}</ref>

In the 1960s, many Sudanese, Rwandan, and Congolese refugees settled in the city.<ref>Britannica,

The [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) under the leadership of [[Joseph Kony]] sprang up in the 1990s after Auma/Lakwena went to Kenya. The LRA became increasingly violent in Gulu and surrounding communities.<ref>Doom, Ruddy and Koen Vlassenroot. "Kony's Message: A New Koine?

At one time, an estimated two million people lived in these camps. In April 2009, all the IDP camps were closed and the people were allowed to return to their villages.<ref>{{cite web | date=5 April 2009 | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/676950?highlight&q=IDP_camps_Gulu | title=Gulu Closes IDP Camps | last=Moro | access-date=21 February 2015 | first=Justin | newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala) | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221181017/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/676950?highlight&q=IDP_camps_Gulu | archive-date=21 February 2015 }}</ref> By July 2009, an estimated 1,452,000 people (80.7 percent of those living in the camps) had voluntarily left the camps to return home.<ref>{{cite web | first=Roberta | url=http://www.unhcr.org/46e6a68013.html | title=Uganda's IDP Camps Start To Close As Peace Takes Hold | date=11 September 2007 | access-date=21 February 2015 | last=Russo | publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unhcr.org/4f06e2a79.html | title=UNHCR Closes Chapter On Uganda's Internally Displaced People | date=6 January 2012 | access-date=21 February 2015 | publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) | first=Kai | last=Nielsen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/24/northern-uganda-displaced-people-out-in-cold | title=Northern Uganda's Displaced People Are Left To Fend for Themselves | access-date=21 February 2015 | first=Alice | last=Klein | date=24 January 2012 | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] (London)}}</ref> Since the spring of 2007, there has been relative peace in the region as the LRA became a much less significant threat.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

With loans obtained from the [[World Bank]] and [[KfW]], the government of Uganda in 2020, completed Phase I of the Gulu Water Supply and Sanitation Project.

In addition, at least 42 public toilets have been built, capable of accommodating 250 people simultaneously.

Phase II of the project involves establishment of a drinking water intake plant, upstream of [[Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station]], with pumping capacity of {{convert|10000|m3|USgal}} daily. This new potable water source will supply 341,000 people in Gulu and neighboring communities. It also includes the expansion of safe sanitation services to 170,000 new customers.
