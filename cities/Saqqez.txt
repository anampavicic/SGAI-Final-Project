== Etymology ==
{{main|Sakez}}
The name Saqqez derives from the [[Scythian languages|Scythian]] word "''Eskit''" and then "''Sakez''". Before that, it was [[Izirtu]], the capital of [[Mannaeans]]. In some historical sources it has been mentioned that the name of the city is derived from the name of powerful Median ruler [[Cyaxares]] (reigned 625–585 BC), who turned the empire into a regional power, but other historians believe that the name of the city is derived from ''Sakez'' and is attributed to the [[Scythian]]s who settled in the city during the reign of Cyaxares.<ref>{{Cite web|title=شهرستان سقز|url=http://iausaghez.ac.ir/Public/WebSite_Menu_Content/DMC.aspx?MenuID=10205|url-status=dead|access-date=13 May 2021|website=Islamic Azad University - Saqqez Branch|language=fa|archive-date=2 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220102135924/http://iausaghez.ac.ir/Public/WebSite_Menu_Content/DMC.aspx?MenuID=10205}}</ref>{{dubious|date=February 2022}}

== History ==

Saqqez's history goes back to the seventh millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite web|date=9 July 2021|title=Saqqez in Kurdestan Province, dates back to 7th millennium BCE|url=https://irandaily.ir/News/314610.html?catid=3&title=Saqqez-in-Kurdestan-Province--dates-back-to-7th-millennium-BCE|access-date=|website=Iran Daily|language=en-US|archive-date=7 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220207135456/https://irandaily.ir/News/314610.html?catid=3&title=Saqqez-in-Kurdestan-Province--dates-back-to-7th-millennium-BCE|url-status=dead}}</ref> Based on historical ruins and Antiques which have been found in Saqqez,  like the historical treasures of [[Ziwiye hoard]] in the [[Ziwiyeh Castle]], experts like [[Roman Ghirshman]] believe that the modern city of Saqqez is built on the site of the ancient capital of the [[Media (region)|Median]] empire. when [[Sargon II]] (reigned 722 – 705 BC) attacked the Median Empire and forced them to flee to [[Ecbatana]] (modern day Hamadan) and made this city his capital. On the attack of Sargon II, the ruler of  Assyria, the Medes were defended and their fortifications were destroyed. Thereafter, the [[Scythians]] tried to rebuild this city and they chose Saqqez, then named [[Sakez|Eskit]] as their capital. This city was repeatedly attacked by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Roman people|Romans]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ghirshman|first=Roman|title=Iran: from the earliest times to the Islamic conquest|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1961|isbn=0140202390|pages=Season 2|language=English}}</ref>

== Geography ==
=== Geology ===
The city of Saqqez is built on long plains and hills, which are crossed by the main tributaries of rivers such as [[Zarrineh River]] and [[Simineh River]]. The lowlands and heights inside the city and the view of [[Saqqez River]] that passes through the center of this city are its special features. Saqqez is located in mountainous and highlands between the irregular heights of [[Zagros Mountains]], and this special geomorphological feature has led to relatively cold climates and long winters and sometimes frost.<ref>[https://sustainearth.sbu.ac.ir/article_99008.html Dating of late Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial sediments Using OSL, Uranium series and 14 C methods in the Saqqez River] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211013225308/https://sustainearth.sbu.ac.ir/article_99008.html |date=13 October 2021 }}, Shahid beheshti University, 2020</ref><ref>[http://www.mapnall.com/en/Map-Saqqez_115842.html Saqqez], mapnall</ref>

=== Climate ===
At an [[altitude]] of 1,476 metres (4,842 feet), Saqqez has a [[Humid continental climate|Mediterranean continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dsa'') with hot, very dry summers and cold, snowy winters. Summers feature large [[diurnal temperature variation]] due to decreased air density at high altitude and low humidity. In 1969 Saqqez recorded a temperature of {{convert|&minus;36|C|F|0}}, the lowest ever recorded by an Iranian [[weather station]] until Kheirabad Zanjan recorded {{convert|&minus;36.4|C|F|1}} on January 29, 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/08/feb/1191.html|title=An extremely cold winter in Iran|access-date=9 April 2010|archive-date=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112192832/http://www.payvand.com/news/08/feb/1191.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irimo.ir/english/monthly&annual/map/province/zanjan.asp |title=Archived |access-date=June 12, 2023 |url-status=unfit |website=www.irimo.ir |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615122930/http://www.irimo.ir/english/monthly%26annual/map/province/zanjan.asp |archive-date=2011-06-15}}{{Dead Link|date=June 2023}}</ref> Saqqez again reached &minus;36&nbsp;°C during the February 3–9 [[1972 Iran blizzard]].
