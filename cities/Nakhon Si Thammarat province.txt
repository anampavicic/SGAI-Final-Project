==History==
[[File:Nakhon Si Thammarat City Pillar Shrine.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Nakhon Si Thammarat City Pillar Shrine]]
{{main|Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom}} 
Nakhon Si Thammarat is one of the oldest cities in Thailand with a rich history. The earliest settlement in the vicinity of the city was Tha Rua, about ten kilometers south of the modern city, where ceramics from the [[Song dynasty]] were found dated to the twelfth century.
In ancient times, Nakhon Si Thammarat was under the rule of the [[Srivijaya]], the king of [[Srivijaya]] had established a foothold on the [[Malay Peninsula]] at Ligor" by 775, where he "built various edifices, including a sanctuary dedicated to the [[Buddha]] and to the Bodhisattvas Padmapani and [[Vajrapani]]. 

The ''Chronicles of Nakhon Si Thammarat'', composed in the seventeenth century, attributed the foundation of current city of Nakhon Si Thammarat to King Sri Thammasok in the thirteenth century. An inscription found at Chaiya stated that King Sri Thammasok ruled Tambralinga in 1231. King Sri Thammasok constructed [[Wat Phra Mahathat]] and introduced Singhalese [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]] held authorities over "twelve cities" that extended from [[Chumphon]] to the north and [[Pahang]] to the south. The [[Ram Khamhaeng Inscription|Ramkamhaeng Stele]] of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] first mentioned "Nakhon Si Thammarat" in 1292, which means "The City of King Sri Thammasok" or "The City of the Virtuous king". The Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom ended and the city perished in the fourteenth century. The ruler of [[Phetchaburi]] known as Phra Phanom Thale sent his son Phra Phanom Wang to re-establish the city and rule. Nakhon Si Thammarat then came under the influence of Central Siamese [[Kingdom of Ayutthaya]] under the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala system]].

===Ayutthaya Period===
Nakhon Si Thammarat was further incorporated into [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], who appointed governors to the city, through centralization under King [[Trailokanat]] in the fifteenth century. Nakhon Si Thammarat served as the main seat of Siamese authority over Southern Thailand and the Malay Peninsula, becoming Muang Ek or first-level city. [[Yamada Nagamasa]], the Japanese adventurer, was appointed as the governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat in 1629.

After the [[Siamese revolution of 1688]], the governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat rebelled against the new [[King Phetracha]]. King Phetracha sent troops to put down rebels in Nakhon Si Thammarat in 1692.

===Thonburi Period===
After the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767)|Fall of Ayutthaya]] in 1767, Phra Palat Nu the vice-governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat established himself as the local warlord and ruler over Southern Thailand. [[King Taksin]] of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] marched south to subjugate Phra Palat Nu or ''Chao Phraya'' Nakhon Nu in 1769. ''Chao Phraya'' Nakhon Nu was taken to Thonburi but King Taksin re-installed Nakhon Nu as a [[tributary state|tributary ruler]] of Nakhon Si Thammarat in 1776.

===Rattanakosin Period===
After [[Chaophraya Nakhon (Noi)]], his son and grandson became respective governors of Nakhon Si Thammarat. During the reforms of [[King Chulalongkorn]], the traditional governorship of Nakhon Si Thammarat was abolished and the city was incorporated into the [[Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat]] in 1896. 

When the [[monthon]] system was abolished in 1932, Nakhon Si Thammarat then became a province until the present.

==Environment==
Forested [[peat swamp forest]]s cover more than 9,900 [[hectare]]s on the borders of Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, and Songkhla provinces. About 800 hectares of the peat swamp were destroyed by 88 fires in the first half of 2019. The Royal Forest Department says that most of the fires in the Khuan Khreng peat swamp forest were man-made. Criminals clear the forest for the illegal expansion of rubber and oil palm plantations. Honey collectors and fishermen were also complicit as they burn grass to catch fish or to collect wild honey. Khuan Khreng peat swamp was hit by drought in what is normally the rainy season making it susceptible to arson. The forest is surrounded by oil palm plantations and surface water in the forest has been drained out to feed the plantations.<ref>{{cite news |title=More firefighters sent to Khuan Khreng swamp fire in Nakhon Si Thammarat |url=https://www.thaipbsworld.com/more-firefighters-sent-to-khuan-khreng-swamp-fire-in-nakhon-si-thammarat/ |access-date=2 August 2019 |work=Thai PBS World |date=1 August 2019}}</ref>

The province has 320 hotels with 8,800 rooms, up from 310 hotels and 7,000 rooms in 2018.<ref name="BP-20190923">{{cite news |last1=Worrachaddejchai |first1=Dusida |title=New province joins 1st-tier tourism ranks |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1756219/new-province-joins-1st-tier-tourism-ranks |access-date=23 September 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=23 September 2019}}</ref>
