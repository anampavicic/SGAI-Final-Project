==History==
{{Further|History of the Galveston Bay Area}}

League City was settled at the former site of a [[Karankawa]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] village.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=LEAGUE CITY, TX |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hel06 |website=tshaonline.org |access-date=January 8, 2016 |first=KLEINER, DIANA |last=J.}}</ref> Three families, the Butlers, the Cowarts, and the Perkinses, are considered to be founding families of the city. The Winfield Family has also recently been acknowledged as a founding family by the City Government.<ref>{{Cite web|last=News |first=JOHN WAYNE FERGUSON The Daily |title=League City to name street after Black founding family |url=https://www.galvnews.com/news/article_ffb6a353-c659-5805-9ff0-15142883b4db.html |access-date=June 11, 2021 |website=The Daily News |date=June 8, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> The Cowart family settled on a creek now called Cowart's Creek after them (now often called "Coward's Creek"). The Perkins family built on a creek notably lined with [[magnolia]] trees and named it Magnolia Bayou. The Butler family settled inland. The Winfield Family purchased land in League City from the great nephew of Stephen F. Austin and moved there, to a place near what is now Hobbs Road.<ref>{{Cite web|last=News |first=MATT DEGROOD The Daily |title=Alex Winfield, Buffalo Soldier and Civil War veteran, leaves mark on League City |url=https://www.galvnews.com/specialsections/article_d9eef947-b7a2-542f-ab1a-430bb2acf8f6.html |access-date=June 11, 2021 |website=The Daily News |date=February 5, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

The first resident of the town proper, George W. Butler, arrived from [[Louisiana]] in 1854 and settled at the junction of [[Clear Creek (Harris County, Texas)|Clear Creek]] and Chigger Bayou. The area was known as Butler's Ranch or Clear Creek until J. C. League acquired the land from a man named Muldoon on his entering the priesthood.<ref name=":0" /> League laid out his townsite along the Galveston, Houston, and Henderson Railroad, already established in the area. This began a small feud over the name, as Butler was the postmaster. The name was changed several times, alternating between Clear Creek and the new League City. In the end, League City was chosen.

In 1907, League had two railroad flatcars of [[live oak]] trees left by the railroad tracks. These were for the residents to plant on their property. Butler and his son Milby supervised the planting of these trees, now known as the Butler Oaks. Many of them line Main Street to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=League City Historical Society - League City, Texas |url=http://leaguecityhistory.org/liveoak.html |website=leaguecityhistory.org |access-date=January 8, 2016 |archive-date=January 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120105605/http://leaguecityhistory.org/liveoak.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Starting in the early 1970s, the bodies of 30 murdered women were discovered in Galveston County, with 4 being discovered in League City, and more have gone missing from the same area.<ref>FBI Website"[https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/seeking-information-in-unsolved-killing-fields-murders-091819]"</ref> This location has become known as the [[Texas Killing Fields (location)|Texas Killing Fields]].

In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] forced many families to move to other areas, including League City. This meant an influx of children out of [[Galveston ISD]] and into other school districts like [[Clear Creek ISD]] and [[Dickinson ISD]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=cecba57d52dda271 |title=Forces drive people off island |access-date=December 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807084209/http://www.galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=cecba57d52dda271 |archive-date=August 7, 2011}}</ref>

League City became an incorporated city in 1962. League City's government consists of seven council members and the mayor.
