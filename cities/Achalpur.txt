It is the second most populous city in [[Amravati District]] after Amravati and seventh most populous city in [[Vidarbha]]. Achalpur camp is known as Paratwada.

=='''History'''==
Achalpur was the earliest capital of a branch of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], which emerged sometime in the 8th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=PhD|first=James G. Lochtefeld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FsB3psOTIC&q=achalpur+rashtrakuta&pg=PA565|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2|date=2001-12-15|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc|isbn=978-0-8239-3180-4|language=en}}</ref> It was the site of a battle between the Rashtrakutas and the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuris]] in the 9th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Raghunathan|first=N.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJ2KAAAAMAAJ&q=achalpur+rashtrakuta|title=Memories, Men, and Matters|date=1999|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=9788172761561|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Maharashtra (India)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWtDAAAAYAAJ&q=kalchuri+rashtrakuta+battle+achalapur|title=Maharashtra State Gazetteers|date=1986|publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications, Maharashtra State|language=en}}</ref>

Achalpur or Ellichpur was first mentioned authentically in the 13th century as one of the famous cities of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} Though tributary to the [[Delhi Sultanate]] after 1294, it remained under [[Hindu]] administration till 1318 when it came directly under the Muslim [[Delhi Sultanate]].

In 1347 Achalpur with the Berar region was ruled by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]].

In 1490 [[Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk]] proclaimed his independence and founded the [[Imad Shahi dynasty]] of the [[Berar Sultanate]]. He proceeded to annex [[Mahur, Maharashtra|Mahur]] to his new kingdom and established his capital at Ellichpur. It was afterwards the capital of the [[Berar Subah]] at intervals until the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] occupation when the seat of the provincial governor was moved to [[Balapur, Akola district|Balapur]]. The town retains many relics of the [[Berar Sultanate|Sultans of Berar]].<ref name="Chisholm">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ellichpur|volume=9|page=291|}}</ref>

As the Mughal empire deteriorated in the 18th century, Achalpur along with the rest of Berar came under the rule of the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]]. In 1853, [[Berar Province]] came under [[British India|British]] administration, although it remained formally part of the [[Hyderabad state]] until 1903 when the province became the [[Berar Division]] of the [[Central Provinces]]. Achalpur, known by the British as Ellichpur, became part of East Berar, with Amraoti (Amravati) as the capital of the division. In 1867 East Berar was split into the districts of [[Amravati District|Amraoti]] and [[Ellichpur district]], with Ellichpur as the headquarters of Ellichpur District. The district had an area of {{convert|2605|sqmi|km2}}.

In 1901 Achalpur had a population of 29,740, with ginning factories and a considerable trade in cotton and forest produce. It was connected by good roads with Amraoti and [[Chikhaldara]].  Berar was annexed to British India in 1903 and merged with the [[Central Provinces]], and in 1905 Ellichpur District was merged into Amraoti District. The civil station of [[Paratwada]], 5&nbsp;km. from the town of Ellichpur, contained the principal public buildings at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name="Chisholm"/>

After India's independence in 1947, the Central Provinces became the province, and after 1950 the state, [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The 1956 [[States Reorganisation Act]] redrew the boundaries of India's states along linguistic lines, and the predominantly [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking Amravati District was transferred to [[Bombay State]], which was renamed [[Maharashtra]] in 1960.

=='''Geography'''==
Achalpur and [[Paratwada]] are twin cities located in the lap of [[Satpura Range|Satpuda]] .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/16/Achalpur.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Achalpur, India|work=fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 369&nbsp;metres (1210&nbsp;ft). These twin cities are surrounded by rivers named Sapan and Bicchhan, the tributaries of [[Chandrabhaga river (Amravati district)|Chandrabhaga river]]. There is a hilly area that acts like a fence to this city. This city is at the boundary of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Even Madhya Pradesh is so close to this city that travelling of (about) 12&nbsp;km changes the state region.

=='''Demographics'''==
As of census 2011, Achalpur Tehsil had a population of 1,12,311.
As of 2001 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archive-date=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns (Provisional)|access-date=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Achalpur & Paratwada had a population of 107,304.
