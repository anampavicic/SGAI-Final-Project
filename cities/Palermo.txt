The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700&nbsp;years old. Palermo is in the northwest of the island of Sicily, by the Gulf of Palermo in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].

The city was founded in 734&nbsp;BC by the [[Phoenicia]]ns as {{transliteration|phn|Sis|italic=no}} ("flower"). Palermo then became a possession of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]. Two [[ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[ancient Greek colonization|colonies]] were established, known collectively as {{transliteration|grc|Panormos|italic=no}}; the Carthaginians used this name on their coins after the 5th century{{nbsp}}BC. As {{lang|la|Panormus|italic=no}}, the town became part of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]] for over a thousand years. From 831 to 1072 the city was under [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Arab rule]] in the [[Emirate of Sicily]] when the city became the capital of Sicily for the first time. During this time the city was known as {{transliteration|ar|Balarm|italic=no}}.<ref name="trabia">{{cite web |last1=Trabia |first1=Carlo |website=Best of Sicily |title=Discovering the Kalsa |url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art184.htm |access-date=26 December 2017 |archive-date=6 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506004208/http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art184.htm}}</ref>

== Geography ==

Palermo lies in a basin, formed by the Papireto, Kemonia and Oreto rivers. The basin was named the ''Conca d'Oro'' (the Golden Basin) by the [[Arabs]] in the 9th century. The city is surrounded by a mountain range which is named after the city itself. These mountains face the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Palermo is home to a [[natural port]] and offers views to the sea, especially from [[Monte Pellegrino]].

=== Climate ===

[[File:Il golfo di Mondello.jpg|thumbnail|left|Gulf of Mondello seen from Monte Pellegrino]]
Palermo experiences a hot-summer subtropical [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa'') with moderate seasonality. Summers are very long, hot and dry due to the domination of subtropical high pressure system, while winters are mild and changeable, with rainy weather due to the polar front.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palermo.climatemps.com/ |title=Palermo, Sicily Climate Palermo, Sicily Temperatures Palermo, Sicily Weather Averages |website=www.palermo.climatemps.com |access-date=20 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320161835/http://www.palermo.climatemps.com/ |archive-date=20 March 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Temperatures in autumn and spring are typically warm.

=== Topography ===

[[File:Sommer, Giorgio (1834-1914) - n. 9000 - PALERMO - Monte Pellegrino.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Pellegrino]], pictured at the end of the 19th century; the mountain is visible from everywhere in the city.]]

Palermo is surrounded by mountains, which form a cirque around the city. Some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves. Historically, it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of Sicily from the city because of the mounts. The tallest peak of the range is La Pizzuta, about {{cvt|1333|m}} high. However, historically, the most important mount is [[Monte Pellegrino]], which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain with the mount lying right in front of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], as "the most beautiful promontory in the world", in his essay ''[[Italian Journey]]''.

=== Rivers ===

Today both the [[Papireto]] river and the [[cemonia|Kemonia]] are covered up by buildings. However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built on them follow their shapes. Today the only waterway not drained yet is the Oreto river that divides the downtown of the city from the western uptown and the industrial districts. In the basins there were, though, many seasonal torrents that helped formed swampy plains, reclaimed during history; a good example of which can be found in the borough of [[Mondello]].

== Landmarks ==
{{wide image|Panoramica Cattedrale di Palermo.jpg|550px|Palermo Cathedral}}

Palermo has a large architectural heritage and is notable for its many [[Norman architecture|Norman buildings]].

=== Palaces and museums ===

[[File:Palermo-Castle-bjs-1.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo dei Normanni]], seat of the Sicilian Regional Assembly]]

* [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] (the Norman Palace), a notable example of [[Norman architecture]], this palace houses the [[Cappella Palatina]].
* [[Zisa, Palermo|Zisa]] (1160) and [[Cuba, Palermo|Cuba]], magnificent castles/houses historically used by the kings of Palermo for hunting. The Zisa today houses the Islamic museum. The Cuba was once encircled by water.
* [[Palazzo Natoli]]
* [[Palazzo Chiaramonte]]
* [[Palazzo Abatellis]]: built at the end of the 15th century for the prefect of the city, Francesco Abatellis. It is a massive though elegant construction, in typical [[Gothic architecture|Catalan Gothic]] style, with [[Renaissance]] influences. The Gallery houses an Eleonora of Aragon bust by [[Francesco Laurana]] (1471) and the ''[[Malvagna Triptych]]'' ({{circa}} 1510), by [[Jan Mabuse|Jan Gossaert]] and an ''Annunziata'' by [[Antonello da Messina]].
* [[Antonino Salinas Regional Archeological Museum]]: museum includes numerous remains from [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] civilisations. It houses all the decorative remains from the Sicilian temples of [[Segesta]] and [[Selinunte]].
* [[Palazzina Cinese]]: royal residence of the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]] and location of the Ethnographic Museum of Sicily.

=== Churches ===

[[File:Basilica San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo.jpg|thumb|[[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d'Assisi]]]]

* [[Palermo Cathedral]]: the long history of the cathedral led to an accumulation of different architectural styles, the latest being the 18th century.
* [[Cappella Palatina]], 12th century chapel of the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], has outstanding mosaics in both Western and the Eastern traditions and a roof by Saracen craftsmen.
* [[San Giovanni dei Lebbrosi, Palermo|San Giovanni dei Lebbrosi]]
* [[San Giovanni degli Eremiti]]: 12th-century church, near Palazzo dei Normanni, notable for bright red domes, a remnant of Arab influence in Sicily. In his ''Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily'', F. Elliot described it as "...&nbsp;totally oriental... it would fit well in [[Baghdad]] or [[Damascus]]". The bell tower is an example of Norman architecture.
* [[Martorana|Chiesa della Martorana]]: also known as ''Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio'' (''St Mary of the Admiral''), church annexed to the next-door church of [[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo]] and overlooks Piazza Bellini in central Palermo. Original layout was a compact [[cross-in-square]] ("Greek cross plan"), a common south Italian and Sicilian variant of the middle Byzantine period church style. Three eastern [[apse]]s adjoin directly to the [[Shrine|naos]], instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in eastern Byzantine architecture.<ref>Kitzinger, ''Mosaics'', 29–30.</ref> The bell tower, lavishly decorated, still serves as the main entrance to the church. The interior decoration is elaborate, and includes Byzantine mosaics.
* [[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo]]: church on central Piazza Bellini, another example of [[Norman architecture]].
* [[Santa Maria della Gancia, Palermo|Santa Maria della Gancia]]
* [[Santa Caterina, Palermo|Santa Caterina]]: church located on Piazza Bellini, behind Piazza Pretoria, built between 1566 and 1596.
* [[Santa Maria della Catena, Palermo|Santa Maria della Catena]]: built between 1490 and 1520. Designed by [[Matteo Carnilivari]]: The name derives from chains that were once attached to one of the walls.
* [[Church of Saint Dominic, Palermo|San Domenico]]: located near [[Via Roma]], now "Pantheon of illustrious [[Sicilians]]".
* [[San Giuseppe dei Teatini]]: located near the [[Quattro Canti]], it is an example of [[Sicilian Baroque]].
* [[Oratorio di San Lorenzo]]: working in stucco, Rococo sculptor [[Giacomo Serpotta]] and his family decorated the church (1690/98–1706) with such a profusion of statuary, and an abundance of putti, the walls appear alive. In October 1969, two thieves removed Caravaggio's ''[[Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence]]'' from its frame. It has never been recovered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/fbi-top-ten-art-crimes/nativity-with-san-lorenzo-and-san-francesco |title=Theft of Caravaggio's Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=17 September 2012 |access-date=9 May 2017 |archive-date=16 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216043359/https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/fbi-top-ten-art-crimes/nativity-with-san-lorenzo-and-san-francesco |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Sooke |first=Alastair |title=Caravaggio's Nativity: Hunting a stolen masterpiece |date=23 December 2013 |work=BBC website |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20131219-hunting-a-stolen-masterpiece |access-date=24 December 2013 |archive-date=24 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224073639/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20131219-hunting-a-stolen-masterpiece |url-status=live}}</ref>
* [[Oratorio del Rosario, Palermo|Oratorio del Rosario]]: completed by Giacomo Serpotta in (1710–17)
* [[Santa Teresa alla Kalsa]], derives its name from [[Al-Khalisa]], an Arabic term meaning ''elected'', was constructed between 1686 and 1706 over the former [[Emir]]'s residence, is one of the best examples of [[Sicilian Baroque]]. It has a single, airy nave, with [[stucco]] decorations from the early 18th century.
* [[Santa Maria dello Spasimo]] was built in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. This church inspired [[Raphael]] to paint his famous ''[[Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary (Raphael)|Sicilia's Spasimo]]'', now in the [[Museo del Prado]]. The church today is a fascinating open-air auditorium, which occasionally houses exhibitions and musical shows.
* [[Church of the Gesù, Palermo|Church of the Gesù]] ("Church of Jesus"): located in the city centre, the church was built in 1564 in the late-Renaissance style by the Jesuits. It was built over a pre-existing convent of [[Basilian monk]]s. Alterations in 1591 were completed in a Sicilian Baroque. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the [[fresco]]s. The interior has a [[Christian cross|Latin cross]] plan with a nave and two aisles, and has a particularly rich decoration of marbles, intarsia and stuccoes, especially in [[Saint Anne|St Anne's]] Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The building has been home to the Municipal Library since 1775.
* [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco di Assisi]]: church built between 1255 and 1277 in what was once the market district of the city, at the site of two pre-existing churches and was largely renovated in the 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, the last after an [[earthquake]]. After the 1943 bombings, the church was restored to its Medieval appearance, which now includes part of the original building such as part of the right side, the apses and the Gothic portal in the façade. The interior has a typical Gothic flavour, with a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of cylindrical pilasters. Some of the chapels are in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], as well as the late 16th century side portals. The church includes precious sculptures by [[Antonello Gagini|Antonio]], [[Giacomo Gagini]] and [[Francesco Laurana]]. Of note are also statues built by Giacomo Serpotta in 1723.
* Church of the Magione: officially known as the church of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. This church was built in the Norman style in 1191 by Matteo d'Ajello, who donated it to the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]].

=== Squares and public monuments ===

[[File:Sicilia Palermo1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Piazza Pretoria]]

* [[Quattro Canti]] is a small square at the crossing of the ancient main roads (now: Corso [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele]] and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (''[[Mandamento (administrative district)|mandamenti]]''). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque façades so the square has an almost octagonal form.
* [[Piazza Pretoria]] was planned in the 16th century near the Quattro Canti as the site of a fountain by [[Francesco Camilliani]], the Fontana Pretoria.
* The [[Charles V Monument (Palermo)|monument to Charles V]] on Piazza Bologni, erected in 1631.

=== City walls ===

[[File:MuraPunichePalermo.JPG|thumb|[[Phoenicia]]n wall in via degli Schioppettieri]]
[[File:Palermo palazzo normanni.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo dei Normanni]]]]

Palermo had two rings of [[city wall]]s, many parts of which still survive.<ref>Pezzini Elena. Un tratto della cinta muraria della città di Palermo. In: Mélanges de l'École française de Rome. Moyen-Age, tome 110, n°2. 1998. pp. 719-771.

DOI : https://doi.org/10.3406/mefr.1998.3654</ref> The first ring surrounded the ancient core of the Phoenician city, the ''Palaeopolis'' or ''Paleapolis'' (in the area east of Porta Nuova) and the ''Neapolis''. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road east–west through this early walled city. The eastern edge of the walled city was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porto Nuovo.

The walls followed the course of the two rivers that surround the city, the Kemonia and the Papireto, creating a natural moat and improving the military security of the city. During the Roman era, they were certainly implemented, as deducible from the subsequent account of Procopius of Caesarea about the capture of Palermo.

In the medieval period the city was expanded with a second wall. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road east–west through the walled city. The west gate was still Porta Nuova, the walls continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this northeast corner the [[Castello a Mare]] protected the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at [[Santa Maria della Catena, Palermo|Santa Maria della Catena]] (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porta Nuova.<ref>Palermo – City Guide by Adriana Chirco, 1998, Dario Flaccovio Editore.</ref>

Several gates in the city wall survive.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/albumMap?uname=107794929208535064679&aid=5726470220811767345&locked=true#map |title=Picasa Web Albums – Kevin Flude – Palermo City |date=1 April 2012 |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904035935/https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/albumMap?uname=107794929208535064679&aid=5726470220811767345&locked=true#map |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Opera houses ===

[[File:Palermo-Teatro-Massimo-bjs2007-02.jpg|thumb|[[Teatro Massimo]] opera house]]

[[File:Palermo Teatro Politeama BW 2012-10-09 16-44-27.jpg|thumb|[[Teatro Politeama, Palermo|Teatro Politeama]]]]

Up until the beginning of the 20th century there were hundreds of small opera theatres known as ''magazzeni'' in the city of Palermo.

* The [[Teatro Massimo]] ("Greatest Theatre") was opened in 1897. It is the biggest in Italy ({{cvt|8000|m2|sqft|disp=semicolon}}), and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the [[Paris Opera]] and the [[Vienna State Opera]]), renowned for its perfect acoustics. [[Enrico Caruso]] sang in a performance of ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'' during the opening season, returning for ''[[Rigoletto]]'' at the very end of his career. Closed for renovation from 1974 until 1997, it is now restored and has an active schedule.
* The [[Teatro Politeama, Palermo|Teatro Politeama]] was built between 1867 and 1874.

=== Other sights ===

[[File:Orto botanico Palermo 04.jpg|thumb|[[Orto botanico di Palermo|Palermo Botanical Garden]]: the Winter Garden greenhouses]]

The "[[Wall of Legality]]" ( [[Il Muro Della Legalità]] ) depicts 38 important persons who helped in fighting the mafia. The street art project was inaugurated in July 2022 and is a joint effort by 19 artists. It can be found at Piazza degli Aragonesi.

The cathedral has a [[heliometer]] (solar observatory) dating to 1690, one of a number<ref name="ref1">{{cite web |url=http://cis.alma.unibo.it/NewsLetter/090496Nw/Heilbron.htm |title=A paper from University of Bologna describing Heliometers in Italian Cathedrals |publisher=Cis.alma.unibo.it |date=6 December 1995 |access-date=3 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413205139/http://cis.alma.unibo.it/NewsLetter/090496Nw/Heilbron.htm |archive-date=13 April 2011}}</ref> built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as [[pinhole camera]], projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at [[noon|solar noon]] (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, ''[[Meridian (astronomy)|la Meridiana]]'', on the floor, running precisely north–south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s; [[zodiac|signs of the zodiac]] show the various other dates throughout the year.

The purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of [[time in physics|time]] and the [[Gregorian calendar|calendar]]. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24‑hour) day was measured from the moment of dawn, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. It was also important to know when the [[Equinox|vernal equinox]] occurred, to provide the correct date for [[Easter]].

The [[Orto botanico di Palermo]] (Palermo Botanical Garden), founded in 1785, is the largest in Italy with a surface of {{cvt|10|ha}}.

One site of interest is the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[Capuchin catacombs of Palermo|Catacombs]], with many [[mummy|mummified]] [[Cadaver|corpse]]s in varying degrees of preservation.

Close to the city is the {{cvt|600|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Monte Pellegrino]], offering a panorama of the city, its surrounding mountains and the sea.

Another good panoramic viewpoint is the promontory of Monte Gallo ({{cvt|586|m|ft|disp=semicolon}}), near Mondello Beach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siciliaincammino.it/promontori-sul-mare-ascesa-monte-gallo-da-partanna-mondellopalermo |title=Promontori sul mare: Ascesa a Monte Gallo da Partanna Mondello(Palermo) &#124; Sicilia...

Moreton Bay fig of >30 m girth and of 32m height can be found on the Piazza Marina.

On the boulevard [[Via Roma, Palermo|Via Roma]] is the [[Palazzo delle Poste, Palermo|Palazzo delle Poste]], an official Italian government building created during the [[Mussolini era]] in the [[Stripped Classicism|stripped classicism]] architectural style. It was designed by the [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalist]] and later fascist government architect, [[Angiolo Mazzoni]]. Perhaps its most famous feature is the five mural cycle in the [[Futurist]] style painted by the artist [[Benedetta Cappa]] titled "Sintesi delle Comunicazioni" (Synthesis of Communication).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thule-italia.com/wordpress/2014/04/17/il-palazzo-delle-poste-di-palermo/ |title=Il Palazzo delle Poste di Palermo &#124; Thule Italia |access-date=3 March 2021 |archive-date=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920220056/http://thule-italia.com/wordpress/2014/04/17/il-palazzo-delle-poste-di-palermo/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/arts/design/guggenheim-is-to-show-rare-murals-by-a-futurist.html |title=Guggenheim is to Show Rare Murals by a Futurist |newspaper=The New York Times |date=20 January 2014 |access-date=3 March 2021 |archive-date=12 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112032211/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/arts/design/guggenheim-is-to-show-rare-murals-by-a-futurist.html |url-status=live |last1=Donadio |first1=Rachel}}</ref>

In 2010, there were 1.2&nbsp;million people living in the greater Palermo area, 655,875 of which resided in the City boundaries, of whom 47.4% were male and 52.6% were female. People under age 15 totalled 15.6% compared to pensioners who composed 17.2% of the population. This compares with the Italian average of 14.1% people under 15 years and 20.2% pensioners. The average age of a Palermo resident is 40.4 compared to the Italian average of 42.8. In the ten years between 2001 and 2010, the population of Palermo declined by 4.5%, while the population of Italy, as a whole, grew by 6.0%. The reason for Palermo's decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and to [[Northern Italy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/ |title=Informazioni, CAP e dati utili |publisher=Comuni-Italiani.it |access-date=29 August 2011 |archive-date=8 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908121642/http://www.comuni-italiani.it/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The current [[birth rate]] of Palermo is 10.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.3 births.

Evidence of [[Colonisation|human settlement]] in the area now known as Palermo goes back to at least the [[Mesolithic]] period, perhaps around [[8th millennium BC|8000&nbsp;BC]], where a group of cave drawings at nearby [[Addaura]] from that period have been found.<ref>Sandars, Nancy K., ''Prehistoric Art in Europe'', Penguin (Pelican, now Yale, History of Art), 1968 (nb 1st edn.), pp. 85–86</ref> The original inhabitants were [[Sicani]] people who, according to [[Thucydides]], arrived from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (perhaps [[Catalonia]]).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Sicily_-_History/id/5462681 |publisher=Experience Festival |title=Sicily: Encyclopedia II – Sicily – History |date=7 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001248/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Sicily_-_History/id/5462681 |archive-date=31 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7kGAAAAQAAJ&q=segre+sicano&pg=PA11 |publisher=Ensayo historico |title=Aapologetico de la literatura española contra los opiniones |date=7 October 2007 |access-date=18 November 2020 |archive-date=5 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505135753/https://books.google.com/books?id=A7kGAAAAQAAJ&q=segre+sicano&pg=PA11 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Antiquity ===

In the 8th c. BC the [[Phoenicia]]ns built a small settlement on the natural harbour of Palermo, which became known as {{transliteration|phn|Ziz|italic=no}}<ref name="it">{{Cite news |url=http://www.italytravelescape.com/history-of-palermo.htm |publisher=ItalyTravelEscape.com |title=History of Palermo |date=7 October 2007 |access-date=19 June 2008 |archive-date=20 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120221719/http://www.italytravelescape.com/history-of-palermo.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> ({{langx|xpu|𐤑‬𐤉𐤑}}, {{sc|ṣyṣ}}).{{sfnp|Head & al.|1911|p=877}} It became one of the three main Phoenician colonies of Sicily, along with [[Motya]] and [[Soluntum]].

The first settlement was later known as ''Paleapolis'' meaning "Old City". The site chosen by the Phoenicians was connected to the mountains with two roads that today have become Via Cappuccini and Corso Pisani.<ref>Palermo punica _ Catalogo della mostra Palermo, Museo Archeologico Regionale "Antonio Salinas" 6 dicembre 1995 – 30 settembre 1996_ Sellerio Editore 1998 {{ISBN|978-88-7681-116-6}}</ref>

The ''Neapolis'' or "New City", the nucleus of the subsequent expansion of the colony, soon developed in the area between the Paleapolis and the port. The new district expanded rapidly, exceeding the size of the old quarter, and soon became the site of markets, artisan and commercial activities. The walls were extended to embrace the new urban perimeter and two new gates were made, while the old gate at the port was moved to make room for the new buildings. In total there were 4 gates, one on each side of the city. The walls followed the course of the two rivers that surround the city, the Kemonia and the Papireto, creating a natural moat and improving the military security of the city. During the Roman era they were reinforced.<ref>Procopius, Gothic Wars, I, 25-34</ref>

The Cassaro district was probably named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab ''al-qaṣr'' (castle, stronghold, see also [[alcázar]]). The colony developed around a central street ([[decumanus maximus|decumanus]]) now the Corso Vittorio Emanuele.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

[[Carthage]] was Palermo's major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} Palermo came into contact with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the [[Sicilian Wars]], a conflict fought between the Greeks of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and the Carthaginians for control over the island of Sicily.

As the [[Roman Empire]] was falling apart, Palermo fell under the control of several [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]].

After dynastic quarrels however, there was a [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] in 1072. Normans conquered Palermo after a long siege.

=== Early modern era ===

[[File:Piazza Bologni - Carlo V, Albergaria, Palermo, Sicily, Italy - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Charles V Monument (Palermo)|Charles V Monument]] (1631) commemorating the monarch's visit in Palermo in 1535]]

From 1479 until 1713 Palermo was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Spain]], and again between 1717 and 1718. Palermo was also under [[Savoy]] control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718–1720 as a result of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. It was ruled by [[Austria]] between 1720 and 1734.

=== Two Sicilies ===

After the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), Sicily was handed over to the [[House of Savoy]], but by 1734 it was in [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] possession. [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] chose Palermo for his coronation as [[King of Sicily]]. Charles had new houses built for the growing population, while trade and industry grew as well. However, Palermo had become just another provincial city as the Royal Court resided in Naples. Charles' son [[Ferdinand I of Two Sicilies|Ferdinand]], though disliked by the population, took refuge in Palermo after the [[French Revolution]] in 1798. His son [[Prince Alberto of Naples and Sicily|Alberto]] died on the way to Palermo and is buried in the city.

When the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] was founded, the original capital city was Palermo (1816) but a year later moved to [[Naples]].

[[File:Sanesi - La rivoluzione di Palermo-12 gennaio 1848 - ca. 1850.jpg|thumb|The revolution in Palermo (12 January 1848)]]

From 1820 to 1848 Sicily was shaken by upheavals, which culminated on 12 January 1848, with a [[Sicilian revolution of 1848|popular insurrection]], the first one in Europe that year, led by [[Giuseppe La Masa]]. A parliament and constitution were proclaimed. The first president was [[Ruggero Settimo]]. The Bourbons reconquered Palermo in 1849, and it remained under their rule until the [[Expedition of the Thousand]], led by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], conquered the city after the [[Siege of Palermo]] in May 1860. After the [[plebiscite]] later that year Palermo, along with the rest of Sicily, became part of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861).

In the early twentieth century, Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards ''Via Roma'', ''Via Dante'', ''Via Notarbartolo'', and ''Viale della Libertà''. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Many of these were designed by the architect [[Ernesto Basile]]. The Grand Hotel [[Villa Igiea]], designed by Ernesto Basile for the [[Florio]] family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge [[Teatro Massimo]] was designed in the same period by [[Giovan Battista Filippo Basile]], Ernesto's father, and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old [[Rutelli]] Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.

=== The second world war ===

During the [[Second World War]], Palermo was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces in 1942 and 1943, until its capture during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] on 22 July 1943.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/05/09/news/le_bombe_del_9_maggio_1943_che_distrussero_palermo-58431764/ |title=Le bombe del 9 maggio 1943 che distrussero Palermo – Palermo – Repubblica.it |newspaper=La Repubblica |date=9 May 2013| access-date=5 September 2018| archive-date=5 September 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905182046/https://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/05/09/news/le_bombe_del_9_maggio_1943_che_distrussero_palermo-58431764/| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.intrasformazione.com/index.php/intrasformazione/article/view/256/pdf |doi=10.4474/DPS/05/02/SGG256/12 |title=I bombardamenti di Palermo (1940-1943) |journal=Intrasformazione: Rivista di Storia delle Idee |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=146–157 |year=2016 |last1=Pasta |first1=Antinea | access-date=5 September 2018| archive-date=5 September 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175823/http://www.intrasformazione.com/index.php/intrasformazione/article/view/256/pdf| url-status=live}}</ref> The harbour (main objective of the air attacks) and the surrounding quarters were effectively destroyed, as was a considerable part of the city, with heavy civilian casualties.<ref name="auto"/>  When American troops entered Palermo in 1943 they were greeted with "a thunderous welcome by what seemed the entire population demonstrating their feelings about Fascist rule."

=== Italian Republic and today ===

In 1946 the city was declared the seat of the [[Sicilian Regional Assembly|Regional Parliament]], as capital of a Special Status Region (1947) whose seat is in the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]].

In [[1948]] the element [[Technetium]] was discovered in the [[University of Palermo]].

A theme in the city's modern age has been the struggle against the [[Sicilian Mafia]], [[Red Brigades]] and outlaws such as [[Salvatore Giuliano]], who controlled the neighbouring area of [[Montelepre]]. The Italian state effectively has had to share control of the territory, economically and administratively, with the Mafia.

The "[[Sack of Palermo]]" was one of the dramatic consequences of this problem. This popular term refers to the [[Speculation|speculative]] building practices that resulted in the destruction of a great number of historical buildings and green areas in favour of poor buildings, mainly between the 1950s and the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antimafiaduemila.com/home/opinioni/305-mafia-in-pillole/76988-il-sacco-di-palermo-e-la-prima-guerra-di-mafia.html |title=Il Sacco di Palermo e la Prima Guerra di Mafia |website=www.antimafiaduemila.com |date=16 December 2019 |access-date=4 May 2020 |language=it |archive-date=22 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722073016/http://www.antimafiaduemila.com/home/opinioni/305-mafia-in-pillole/76988-il-sacco-di-palermo-e-la-prima-guerra-di-mafia.html |url-status=live}}</ref> The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city.

The Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Palermo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4727672/italy-police-arrest-alleged-new-mafia-boss-in-sicily/ |title=Italy police arrest alleged new mafia boss in Sicily |website=Global News |access-date=17 July 2019 |archive-date=17 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717171817/https://globalnews.ca/news/4727672/italy-police-arrest-alleged-new-mafia-boss-in-sicily/ |url-status=live}}</ref> A [[CNN]] article in July 2019 indicated that [[Sicilian Mafia]] activity in Palermo was particularly notorious in one area: the town of Passo Rigano. "According to Italian police, the Mafia not only engages in extortion there, but also has a large role in the town's legal economy – with its involvement in business such as wholesale food supplies, online betting and gambling." The police investigation at the time also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area mafia and American organized crime, particularly the [[Gambino crime family]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/europe/mafia-arrests-fbi-italy-intl/index.html |title=19 mafia suspects arrested in joint transatlantic raids |author1=Hada Messia |author2=Lauren Kent |website=CNN |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=17 July 2019 |archive-date=17 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717171206/https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/europe/mafia-arrests-fbi-italy-intl/index.html |url-status=live}}</ref> According to [[La Repubblica]], "Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey.

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===

==== Patron saints ====

[[File:GenioPalermoMarabitti.JPG|thumb|[[Genius of Palermo]], the ancient patron of the city]]

The patron saint of Palermo is [[Saint Rosalia]], who is widely revered.

On 14 July, people in Palermo celebrate the annual ''Festino'', the most important religious event of the year. The Festino is a procession that goes through the main street of Palermo to commemorate the miracle attributed to Saint Rosalia who, it is believed, freed the city from the [[Black Death]] in 1624. Her remains were discovered in a cave on Monte Pellegrino, and her remains were carried around the city three times, banishing the plague. There is a [[sanctuary]] marking the spot where her remains were found which can be reached via a scenic bus ride from the city.

Before 1624 Palermo had four [[patron saint]]s, one for each of the four major parts of the city. They were [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]], [[Saint Christina of Bolsena|Saint Christina]], [[Tryphon, Respicius, and Nympha|Saint Nympha]] and [[Saint Olivia]].

[[Saint Lucy]] is also honoured with a celebration on 13 December, during which the inhabitants of Palermo do not eat anything made with flour, but boil wheat in its natural state and use it to prepare a special dish called [[cuccìa]]. This commemorates the saving of the city from famine due to a miracle attributed to Saint Lucy; A ship full of grain mysteriously arrived in the city's harbour and the hungry population wasted no time in making flour but ate the grain as it arrived.

[[Saint Benedict the Moor]] is the heavenly protector of the city of Palermo.

The ancient patron of the city was the [[Genius of Palermo]], [[genius loci]] and [[numen]] protector of the place, that became the secular patron of the modern Palermo.<ref>{{in lang|it}} Alberto Samonà.

After the bankruptcy occurred in the summer of 2019, a new club was formed by the company Hera Hora Srl.

The [[Targa Florio]] was an open road endurance car race held near Palermo. Founded in 1906, it used to be one of the oldest [[sports car racing]] events until it was discontinued in 1977 due to safety concerns but has since run as a rallying event. Palermo was home to the grand depart of the 2008 [[Giro d'Italia]]. The initial stage was a {{cvt|28.5|km|mi|1|adj=mid|-long}} TTT ([[Team time trial|Team Time Trial]]).

The [[Internazionali Femminili di Palermo]] is an annual ladies professional tennis event held in the city, which is part of the [[WTA Tour]].

=== City emblems ===

==== Flag ====
The flag of Palermo is similar to that of the autonomous region of Sicily, but with a different arrangement of colours. The flag displayed on the Palazzo Pretorio, the town hall, has no coat of arms. However, versions with coats of arms of variable appearance in the center have been observed; for example, around the 1950s or 1960s the flag bore the civic coat of arms form ''Il Blasone in Sicilia''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Italia città |url=http://www.rbvex.it/italiac.html#paler |access-date=2023-06-17 |website=www.rbvex.it}}</ref> <gallery>
