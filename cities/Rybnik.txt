'''Rybnik''' (<small>Polish pronunciation:</small> {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Rybnik.ogg|'|r|y|b|ń|i|k}}; {{langx|szl|Rybńik}}; {{langx|de|Rübnick}}) is a city in southern [[Poland]], in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]], around 38 km (24 mi) southwest of [[Katowice]], the region's capital, and around 19 km (11 mi) from the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border. It is one of the major cities of the [[Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area]] with a population of 5.3 million and the main city of the so-called ''[[:pl:Subregion Zachodni|Subregion Zachodni]]'', previously also known as the [[Rybnik Coal Area]]. With a population of 135,994 as of January 1, 2022, it is the 25th most-populous city in Poland.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Największe miasta w Polsce pod względem liczby ludności|url=https://www.polskawliczbach.pl/najwieksze_miasta_w_polsce_pod_wzgledem_liczby_ludnosci|access-date=2021-09-24|website=Polska w liczbach|language=pl}}</ref>

Rybnik is the center of commerce, business, transportation and culture for the southwestern part of the Silesian Voivodeship, a consolidated [[Consolidated city-county|city-county]] and the seat of a separate suburban [[Rybnik County|Rybnik county]]. Rybnik is particularly recognized for its contributions to music, with the [[Karol and Antoni Szafranek Secondary and Tertiary State School of Music|Szafrankowie School of Music]] musicians such as [[Henryk Górecki]] or [[Lidia Grychtołówna]], among others. It is also a seat of the Rybnik Philharmonic Orchestra.

The name Rybnik derives from an old Slavic word ''rybnik'', meaning a pond ([[Czech language]] still uses it, while in [[Polish language|Polish]] the modern word is ''staw''), which was located in the place of the current market square. In the middle ages, three settlements merged into one town, with a [[Magdeburg rights|German-law]] location dating back to 1308. Fishing, trade and artistry were the main industries. Rybnik's development accelerated in late 19th century upon discovery of rich coal fields, and continued until the 1980s. Since the 1990s, the city attempts to diversify its economy with commerce, health care and business industries.

==History==
The city's name derives from the Proto-Slavic word for "fish" (''ryba'') and meant "fishpond" in the Old [[Polish language]]. The name highlights the importance of [[fish farming]] for the city's economy in the [[Middle Ages]], which is reflected in its [[coat of arms]] until this day.

The city's origins can be traced back into the 9th and 10th century, when three [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements existed on Rybnik's present-day territory which eventually merged to form one town. It became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler [[Mieszko I]] in the 10th century. In the course of the [[medieval]] eastward migration of German settlers ({{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}), Rybnik, as many other Polish settlements, was incorporated (granted city status and right) according to the so-called [[Magdeburg Law]] at some point before 1308 (the exact date remains unknown). This, however, is not to be confused with a change in national affiliation; Rybnik continued to be part of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], until most of [[Silesia]] became a [[fiefdom]] of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian Crown]] in 1327, however Rybnik was still ruled by local Polish dukes of the [[Piast dynasty]] until 1336.

The city continued to grow and developed into a regional trade centre. In the 15th century, the [[Hussites]] devastated the city, before being eventually defeated in a decisive battle on a hill nearby in 1433, with [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Czechs]] fighting on both sides. Around 1469 the city passed under [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] suzerainty, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia. From 1521 Rybnik was again ruled by Polish Piast dukes, as it was integrated with the [[Duchy of Opole and Racibórz]], before in 1532 it eventually was incorporated into Bohemia, which itself came under the authority of the [[Habsburg]] crown. Then the city became the capital of a [[state country]] held by various noble families, including the Polish Węgierski family of [[Rola coat of arms]] from 1682 until the state country's dissolution in 1788.

[[File:Rybnik Ansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Early 19th-century view of Rybnik|alt=Etching showing an early 19th-century view of Rybnik.]]At the beginning of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] between [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (the Great) and the [[Habsburg]] [[empress]] [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], most of Silesia, including Rybnik, was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1740, which [[Habsburg monarchy|Austria]] eventually recognized in 1763. In the 18th century, Rybnik belonged to the tax inspection region of [[Prudnik]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-16 |title=Historia Powiatu Prudnickiego - Starostwo Powiatowe w Prudniku |url=http://www.powiatprudnicki.pl/powiatprudnicki-historiapowiatu.html |access-date=2021-12-07 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116133028/http://www.powiatprudnicki.pl/powiatprudnicki-historiapowiatu.html |archive-date=16 November 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Coal mining gained importance for Rybnik's economy as early as the 18th century. In 1871, Prussia, including Rybnik, merged into the [[German Empire]], the first modern German nation state. At this point, Poland had already ceased to exist as an independent state, having been divided between Prussia, Austria and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the [[Partitions of Poland|Third Partition of Poland]] of 1795.

With the intensification of [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanization]] and [[Anti-Polonism|anti-Polish]] policies in the [[German Empire]] in the late 19th and early 20th century, the ethnically mixed region of [[Upper Silesia]] became affected by growing tensions between German nationalists and indigenous Poles. After the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish state]] was finally restored. Amidst an atmosphere of ethnic unrest, the Polish [[Silesian Uprisings]] broke out, the first of which (in 1919) was centered on Rybnik, and the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite]] was held in 1921 to determine the future state affiliation. The lowest share of pro-German votes was registered in the districts of [[Kreis Rybnik|Rybnik]] (34.7%) and [[Pszczyna]] (25.9%).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2016-03-04|title=Landsmannschaft der Oberschlesier in Karlsruhe|url=http://home.arcor.de/oberschlesien-ka/abstimmung/rybnik.htm|access-date=2021-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050546/http://home.arcor.de/oberschlesien-ka/abstimmung/rybnik.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-05-02|title=Landsmannschaft der Oberschlesier in Karlsruhe|url=http://home.arcor.de/oberschlesien-ka/abstimmung/pless.htm|access-date=2021-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502200241/http://home.arcor.de/oberschlesien-ka/abstimmung/pless.htm|archive-date=2015-05-02}}</ref> However, in the city of Rybnik, 70.8% of the votes were in favour of [[Weimar Republic|Germany]].<ref name=":0" /> The city and the larger part of the Rybnik district were attached to Poland. Rybnik thus became Polish-ruled for the first time since 1788.

Within the [[Second Polish Republic]] of the interwar period, Rybnik was part of the Silesian Voivodeship and enjoyed far-reaching political and financial autonomy. In 1933, brothers Karol and Antoni Szafranek, eminent Polish musicians, founded a music school, today known as the [[Karol and Antoni Szafranek Secondary and Tertiary State School of Music]].

During the joint German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]], which started [[World War II]], in September 1939, Rybnik was captured by Germany, and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe I]]'' entered the city to commit [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|atrocities against Poles]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|title=Był rok 1939.

After the eventual German defeat which ended World War II in the European theatre of war in 1945, Rybnik was once more integrated into Poland, the territory of which was shifted westward on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s initiative. Rybnik thus ceased to be a German-Polish border city. A large portion of ethnic Germans from Rybnik eventually settled in the [[West Germany|West German]] city of [[Dorsten]], which eventually became one of Rybnik's [[twin towns]] in 1994.

In the post-war period, coal mining continued to gain importance. Under Poland's [[People's Republic of Poland|communist rule]] in 1945–1989 the city was projected to grow as a main mining centre of southern Poland. The 1970s saw the construction of an important [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plant]]. A reservoir on the river [[Ruda River (Odra)|Ruda]] was constructed to provide it with cooling water. In 2002, the University of Economics (''Akademia Ekomomiczna''), the [[University of Silesia]] (''Uniwersytet Śląski''), both based in [[Katowice]], and the Silesian Polytechnic University (''Politechnika Śląska'') based in [[Gliwice]] established a joint campus in Rybnik to improve academic training opportunities in the area.

=== Historical population ===
Historically, Rybnik was a small town, with population exceeding 1,000 people only in the late 1700s. It was similar in size to neighboring [[Żory]] and [[Wodzisław Śląski]], around half the size of [[Gliwice]] and 1/3 the size of [[Racibórz]]. The population development accelerated after [[Upper Silesia]] was annexed by [[Prussia]] in 1740. In 1818, Rybnik became a county seat and in 1856 Rybnik was connected with Racibórz by rail. Two years later, in 1858, Rybnik gained a rail connection with Katowice, further accelerating growth. While the discovery of large [[coal]] deposits around Rybnik in late 1800s and early 1900s caused capital inflow and population growth of neighboring villages and settlements, Rybnik continued to be primarily a market town rather than transform into a large industrial city like other towns in the region, particularly in the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]]. This changed after [[World War II]], when the [[Polish People's Republic|Polish]] [[Communist Party of Poland|communist]] government doubled-down on its heavy industrialization platform, increasing [[Coal mining|coal production]] in existing coal mines around Rybnik and building [[Jastrzębie-Zdrój|a new city for miners nearby]]. Due to its central location and existing infrastructure, Rybnik became the center of the [[Rybnik Coal Area]], growing to 44,400 people in 1972.

In the 1970s, under administrative reform, Rybnik annexed a number of neighboring mining towns and villages, growing to 118,200 by the end of the decade. Labor shortages on the local market, created in part by emigration to Germany through the family reunification schemes since the 1950s,<ref>{{Cite web|title=1971: Ankunft erster Aussiedler aus Polen in der Bundesrepublik - Ein weiter Weg nach Westen|url=https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/1971-ankunft-erster-aussiedler-aus-polen-in-der.871.de.html?dram:article_id=491326|access-date=2021-09-24|website=Deutschlandfunk|language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kijonka|first=Justyna|date=2013|title=Migracje z Górnego Śląska do Republiki Federalnej Niemiec w latach 1970-1989, czyli między ojczyzną prywatną a ideologiczną|url=https://rebus.us.edu.pl/bitstream/20.500.12128/1910/1/Kijonka_Migracje_z_Gornego_Slaska_do_Republiki_Federalnej_Niemiec.pdf|journal=Górnośląskie Studia Socjologiczne|volume=4|pages=29–47}}</ref> motivated large state enterprises to recruit workers in other parts of the country.

Rybnik is divided into 27 neighborhoods that are considered auxiliary administrative units. Most of them are suburban areas, including: [[Chwałęcice, Rybnik|Chwałęcice]], [[Golejów, Rybnik|Golejów]], [[Gotartowice]], [[Grabownia, Rybnik|Grabownia]], [[Kamień, Rybnik|Kamień]], [[Kłokocin]], [[Ligota-Ligocka Kuźnia]], [[Meksyk, Rybnik|Meksyk]], [[Ochojec, Rybnik|Ochojec]], [[Orzepowice]], [[Popielów, Rybnik|Popielów]], [[Radziejów, Rybnik|Radziejów]], [[Rybnicka Kuźnia]], [[Północ, Rybnik|Rybnik – Północ]], [[Stodoły, Rybnik|Stodoły]], [[Wielopole, Rybnik|Wielopole]], [[Zamysłów, Rybnik|Zamysłów]] and [[Zebrzydowice, Rybnik|Zebrzydowice]].

Two districts ([[Boguszowice Osiedle]] and [[Maroko-Nowiny]]) are typical Polish housing estates, with large blocks of flats and supporting buildings (such as shops and schools) built in communist time. The remaining three districts, [[Smolna, Rybnik|Smolna]], [[Śródmieście, Rybnik|Śródmieście]] and [[Paruszowiec-Piaski]] formed the pre-war town of Rybnik. Those areas are densely built-up, with old town, city hall, most of schools, offices and shopping malls in Śródmieście (literally: ''city centre'' in Polish) and 19th century factories and houses in Paruszowiec.

==Government and politics==

=== Local politics ===
Since the 1999 administrative reform, Rybnik is a [[consolidated city-county]] (''miasto na prawach powiatu''), with the mayor (''prezydent miasta'') who is the executive branch of local government, and a city council (''rada miasta'') of 25 people, which is the legislative branch. The mayor is elected in a citywide election, while the city council is elected in a proportional elections from four voting districts. Additionally, city charter divides Rybnik into 27 districts with a council each. These district councils have auxiliary status, and their main tasks are: organizing public consultations for decisions such as the zoning plan, social control over city investments in their respective areas, lobbying in the city hall for the district. Rybnik is also the seat of the surrounding suburban [[Rybnik County|Rybnik county]] but is not a part of it.

The current mayor of Rybnik is Piotr Kuczera of the [[Civic Platform]] party - due to term limits, he will not be eligible to be elected again in the next election. In the city council, the Civic Platform-Wspólnie dla Rybnika (''Together for Rybnik'') coalition is in power, with the [[Law and Justice]] party and a local Blok Samorządowy Rybnik (''Self-governing Bloc Rybnik'') in opposition.

In contrast to the central part of the [[Upper Silesian Industry Area]] a short distance to the north, Rybnik enjoys the reputation of a "green" city having a relatively clean environment. While the city is not a centre of tourism, it does have various interesting sights and opportunities for recreation. To the north-east of the built-up area, there is a reservoir (''Zalew Rybnicki'') on the river Ruda, which serves as a cooling water source for the power station. Surrounded by forests, it offers swimming, fishing, sailing and surfing opportunities, and due to the power station's [[waste heat]] it is warm enough all year to be a habitat for [[grass carp]]s. The [[Beskidy Mountains]], a popular recreational area, also for skiing, are within a 1–2 hour drive.

'''Sights worth visiting''':
*the [[neo-Gothic]] [[basilica]] of St. Anthony (''Bazylika św. Antoniego'')
*the building of the former district authority (1887)
*the neo-classical new town hall (1928)
*the neo-classical old town hall with clock-tower, today housing the [[registry office]] and the museum of local history
*the Church of St. Catherine (''Kościół św. Katarzyny'') (1534)
*the Church of St. Lawrence (''Kościół św. Wawrzyńca'') (1717)
*a late [[Baroque]] estate house (1736)
*a [[Piast]] castle from the early 13th century, completely redesigned in the 18th century
