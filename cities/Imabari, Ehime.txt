==History==
[[File:Imabari castle.JPG|thumb|[[Imabari Castle]]]]
The area in which Imabari is situated is part of ancient [[Iyo Province]] and had long been a strategic point for the control of the Seto Inland Sea. In the [[Sengoku period]] it was dominated by the Murakami clan, a maritime clan who engaged in shipping or as pilots for vessels through the complex channels and rocky straits in between Shikoku and Honshu, but who also occasionally acted as pirates or as the mercenary naval force for a powerful warlord. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] installed his general [[Tōdō Takatora]] as ''[[daimyō]]'' of the 200,000 ''[[koku]]'' [[Imabari Domain]]. Tōdō Takatora constructed [[Imabari Castle]] and the [[jōkamachi|castle town]] which forms the core of the modern city. The domain was subsequently ruled by a cadet branch of the [[Matsudaira clan|Hisamatsu-Matsudaira clan]] until the end of the [[Edo period]]. The town of Imabari was established on December 15, 1889, with the creation of the modern municipalities system. The town merged with the village of Hiyoshi on February 11, 1920, to become the city of Imabari. Industrialization progressed rapidly in the early 20th century, centered around the textile and shipbuilding industries. The city was bombed three times in the final months of [[World War II]], with the first [[Strategic bombing|air raid]] on April 24, 1945, killing 68 civilians, the second on May 8 killing 29 (mostly students of Imabari Girls' High School) and the third and largest on August 5, during which 454 people died and 80% of the city center was destroyed. The city reconstructed rapidly in the post-war era. 

On January 16, 2005, the towns of [[Hakata, Ehime|Hakata]], [[Kamiura, Ehime|Kamiura]], [[Kikuma, Ehime|Kikuma]], [[Miyakubo, Ehime|Miyakubo]], [[Namikata, Ehime|Namikata]], [[Ōmishima, Ehime|Ōmishima]], [[Ōnishi, Ehime|Ōnishi]], [[Tamagawa, Ehime|Tamagawa]], and [[Yoshiumi, Ehime|Yoshiumi]], and the villages of [[Asakura, Ehime|Asakura]] and [[Sekizen, Ehime|Sekizen]] (all from [[Ochi District, Ehime|Ochi District]]) were merged into Imabari. As a result, there are no more villages within Ehime Prefecture.

==Government==
Imabari has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Imabari, together with Kamijima, contributes six members to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Ehime 2nd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Imabari is home to a large number of shipbuilding and maritime servicing facilities along the northern and eastern coastlines of the city. Facilities include a small container port and maintenance and construction shipyards belonging to [[Imabari Shipbuilding]], Japan's largest ship builder.

The port has also long been a trading center within Shikoku. The city is home to a large cotton processing industry, with particular emphasis on towels. The city produces around 60% of the towels made in Japan. As of 1998, there were over 200 towel production plants in the city. The city also specializes in the dyeing industry.

==Education==
Imabari has 26 public elementary schools and 15 public middle schools operated by the city government and one private combined elementary/middle school. The city has six public high schools operated by the Ehime Prefectural Board of Education and five private high schools. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped. The [[Imabari Meitoku Junior College]] is located in the city, as is the [[Okayama University of Science]] Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.
