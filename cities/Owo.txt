==History==
{{Yoruba people}}
In their [[oral tradition]], Owo traces its origins back to the ancient city of [[Ile-Ife]], the cradle of [[Yoruba culture]].<ref name="metmuseum.org">{{cite web |title=Origins and Empire: The Benin, Owo, and Ijebu Kingdoms |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/beni_2/hd_beni_2.htm |publisher=metmuseum.org |access-date=13 December 2013 |archive-date=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112154748/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/beni_2/hd_beni_2.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Oral tradition also claims that the founders were the sons of the Yoruba deity [[Odudua]], who was the first ruler of Ile-Ife. The early [[Art Historical Photo Archives|art-historical]] and archaeological records reinforce these strong affiliations with Ife culture.<ref name="metmuseum.org"/> Owo was able to maintain virtual independence from the neighboring kingdom of [[Kingdom of Benin|Benin]], but was on occasion required to give tribute.<ref>Smith (1988), ''Kingdoms of the Yoruba'', p. 52.</ref> The transmission of courtly culture flowed in both directions between the [[Benin]] and the Owo kingdoms. The skill of Owo's ivory carvers was also appreciated at the court of [[Benin City|Benin]]. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Benin's rulers increasingly utilized insignia made from [[ivory]], and imported Owo's art objects and recruited its [[artisan]]s for their own royal workshops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exchange of Art and Ideas: The Benin, Owo, and Ijebu Kingdoms |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/beni_1/hd_beni_1.htm |publisher=metmuseum.org |access-date=13 December 2013 |archive-date=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112153938/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/beni_1/hd_beni_1.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
There were other notable artworks that can be evidently supported.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2798654|title=On the Identification of Individual Carvers: A Study of Ancestor Shrine Carvings from Owo, Nigeria|first1=Frank|last1=Willett|first2=John|last2=Picton|year=1967|journal=Man|volume=2|issue=1|pages=62–70|doi=10.2307/2798654|jstor=2798654 |access-date=2011-07-20|archive-date=2016-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307025951/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2798654|url-status=live}}</ref>

Owo came under [[United Kingdom|British]] rule in 1893. After Nigeria declared [[independence]] in 1960, it was part of the [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] until 1967 when it became part of the [[Western State (Nigeria)|Western State]]. Owo and its indigenes played significant roles in the politics of the first [[Republic]] in Nigeria. In 1976, it became part of the newly created [[Ondo State]].<ref name=":1" />

In June 2022, at least 50 worshippers [[Owo church attack|were killed]] in a [[massacre]] at St. Francis [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/africa/mass-shooting-nigeria-church-intl/index.html|title=Mass shooting at Nigeria church kills dozens, says local lawmaker|first1=Nimi|last1=Princewill|first2=Amy|last2=Cassidy|date=2022-06-06|website=[[CNN]]|access-date=2022-06-06|archive-date=2022-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220606021619/https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/africa/mass-shooting-nigeria-church-intl/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gunmen-kill-worshippers-during-church-service-nigeria-media-2022-06-05/|title=At least 50 killed in massacre at Catholic church in southwest Nigeria|date=2022-06-06|website=[[Reuters]]|access-date=2022-06-07|archive-date=2022-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220605155954/https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gunmen-kill-worshippers-during-church-service-nigeria-media-2022-06-05/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Culture==
Owo has the largest palace ([[Palace of Olowo of Owo|Aghofen]]) in [[Africa]] which was declared as a national [[monument]] by the federal government, and is also a cultural landmark in Nigeria<ref name="Tribune Online 2018 c528">{{cite web | title=Inside Africa's largest palace | website=Tribune Online | date=2018-03-27 | url=https://tribuneonlineng.com/inside-africas-largest-palace/ | access-date=2023-12-31}}</ref> Built by [[Olowo Rerengejen]] in the 14th century, the palace had as many as 100 courtyards (Ugha). Each courtyard had a specific function and was dedicated to a particular deity. The largest, said to have been twice the size of an American football field, was used for public assemblies and festivals. Some courtyards were paved with quartz pebbles or broken pottery. Pillars supporting the veranda roofs were carved with statues of the king mounted on a horse or shown with his senior wife. The current Olowo is [[Ajibade Gbadegesin Ogunoye III]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dada |first=Peter |date=2019-07-12 |title=Ajibade emerges new Olowo of Owo |url=https://punchng.com/just-in-ajibade-emerges-new-olowo-of-owo/ |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Economy==
Owo is an agricultural center involved in the growing and trade of [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[cassava]], [[maize]], [[okra]], [[Capsicum|peppers]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], and [[cotton]]. There are, however, other commercial activities in the town including but not limited to [[timber]], [[sawmilling]] and [[Soybean|soya bean]] processing plants as well as blockmaking businesses.<ref name=":1" />

The town is dotted with branches of banks including [[First Bank of Nigeria|First Bank]] Plc, [[Wema Bank]] Plc, [[Polaris Bank Limited|Polaris Bank]] Plc, [[Enterprise Bank]] Ltd. (formerly Omega Bank Plc), [[Access Bank plc|Access Bank Plc]] etc. The city is witnessing a dramatic change due to expansion of its road network, particularly dualization of the main road beginning from the Emure junction up to Iyere exit. A new modern market is now open in Owo.<ref name=":1" />

==Geography==
Owo is situated in southwestern Nigeria, at the southern edge of the Yoruba Hills, and at the intersection of roads from [[Akure]], [[Kabba]], [[Benin City]], and Siluko.<ref name=":0" /> Owo is situated around the halfway point between the towns of [[Ile Ife]] and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Expedition Magazine {{!}} New Treasures From Nigeria |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/new-treasures-from-nigeria/ |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=Expedition Magazine |language=en}}</ref>

==Archaeology==
The Owo site was first excavated in 1969–1971 by [[Ekpo Eyo]] under the [[auspices]] of the [[Department of Antiquities]] of the Government of Nigeria. Due to Owo's location between the two famous art centers of Ife and Benin, the site reflects both artistic traditions. Important discoveries include [[terracotta]] [[sculptures]] dating from the 15th century. The [[Owo Museum]], founded in 1968, houses many of these artifacts.<ref name=":1" />

== Climate in Owo ==
In Owo, the dry season is hot, muggy, and partly cloudy whereas the wet season is warm, oppressive, and overcast. The average annual temperature fluctuates between 65 &nbsp;°F (18.3&nbsp;°C) and 89&nbsp;°F (31.6&nbsp;°C), rarely falling below 59&nbsp;°F (15&nbsp;°C) or rising above 94&nbsp;°F (34.4&nbsp;°C).

For hot-weather activities, favoring clear days with temperatures between 75&nbsp;°F (24&nbsp;°C) and 90&nbsp;°F (32.2&nbsp;°C), the "best" time to visit Owo is from somewhere around early November to mid-February.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Owo Climate, Weather By Month, Average Temperature (Nigeria) - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/51416/Average-Weather-in-Owo-Nigeria-Year-Round |access-date=2023-08-28 |website=weatherspark.com |language=en}}</ref>
