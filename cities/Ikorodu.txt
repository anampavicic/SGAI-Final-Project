==Geography and economy==
Situated approximately 37&nbsp;km north of Lagos, Ikorodu is bounded to the south by the Lagos Lagoon, to the north by a boundary with Ogun State, and to the east by a boundary with [[Agbowa-Ikosi]], a town in [[Epe, Lagos|Epe]] Division of Lagos State. The town has grown significantly in the past 40 years and is divided into sixteen or seventeen "Ituns" or minor areas. The main industries in the town are trading, farming and manufacturing. Ijebu [[dialect]] is widely spoken in ikorodu.

Nearby major towns include Imota, Isiu, Liadi, Egbin, Ijede, Igbogbo and Bayeku, all of which constitute their own Local Council Development Area with their own traditional rulers (Obas). Together these areas make up Ikorodu Division.

Ikorodu Division has a large [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] area containing several [[Factory|factories]]. The town of Ikorodu itself is home to branches of several established Nigerian [[bank]]s.

Ikorodu is the fastest growing part-[[exurb]] of Lagos [[metropolis]], owing in part to increasing influx of people from Ikorodu's surrounding towns and villages attracted by the town's proximity to Lagos.

In 2003, the existing Ikorodu LGAs was split for administrative purposes into Local [[Council]] Development Areas. These lower-tier administrative units now number 6: Imota, Igbogbo/Bayeku, Ijede, Ikorodu North, Ikorodu West,  Ikorodu.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lagosstate.gov.ng/pagemenus.php?p=60&k=32 |title=Lagos State Government |access-date=2017-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122070737/http://www.lagosstate.gov.ng/pagemenus.php?p=60&k=32 |archive-date=2015-01-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Economy ==

=== Imota rice mill ===
The Imota [[Rice huller|rice mill]] is an agricultural plant. It was built in 2021 and will commence full production in the second quarter of 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-12-10|title=Imota rice mill to start production 2022 - Sanwo-Olu|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/500267-imota-rice-mill-to-start-production-2022-sanwo-olu.html|access-date=2022-01-16|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Online|first=Lagos Post|date=2022-01-02|title=2022 Will Be A Season Of Consolidation, Sanwo-Olu Assures Lagosians {{!}} Lagos Post Online|url=https://www.lagospostng.com/2022-will-be-a-season-of-consolidation-sanwo-olu-assures-lagosians/|access-date=2022-01-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Capacity ====
The rice mill has a capacity to produce 2.8 million bags of 50&nbsp;kg bags of [[rice]] yearly, while generating 1,500 direct jobs and 254,000 indirect jobs. On completion, in line with the estimated installed [[infrastructure]] of the facility, the production capacity of the [[rice mill]] in Imota will set it among the largest in the world, and the largest in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-29|title=Lagos multi-billion naira 32MT per hour rice mill to be completed by Q1 2021 - Nairametrics|url=https://nairametrics.com/2020/12/29/lagos-multi-billion-naira-32mt-per-hour-rice-mill-to-be-completed-by-q3-2020/|access-date=2022-01-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Economic effect ====
According to Lagos State governor [[Babajide Sanwo-Olu|Sanwo-Olu]], full production of the facility will drastically reduce prices of rice and pressure to purchase the [[commodity]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-12-10|title=Imota rice mill to start production 2022 - Sanwo-Olu|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/500267-imota-rice-mill-to-start-production-2022-sanwo-olu.html|access-date=2022-01-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> At this moment (early 2022) Nigeria ''produces'' [[husk]] rice, yet ''imports'' hulled/polished rice at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ajala|first1=A. S.|last2=Gana|first2=A.|date=2015-10-26|title=Analysis of Challenges Facing Rice Processing in Nigeria|journal=Journal of Food Processing|language=en|volume=2015|pages=e893673|doi=10.1155/2015/893673|issn=2356-7384|doi-access=free }}</ref> Processing the national [[staple food]] rice in its own country therefore should improve Nigeria's trade balance.

==== Technical process ====
In a rice mill, primarily the [[cereal]]s [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oats]], [[millet]] and [[rice]] are hulled, i.e. the [[husk]]s that are firmly attached to the grain and do not fall off during [[threshing]] are removed (dehusking). The husks are indigestible for the human organism and would negatively influence the taste and chewing sensations. Furthermore, in a rice mill, the hulled cereal grains are usually also subsequently rolled ([[oat flakes]]), cut ([[groats]]) or polished ([[rice]], rolled barley). Other possible processing steps are mostly identical to those in a [[grain mill]].

==== Surroundings ====
The State Government is also developing an industrial park adjacent to the mill. Governor Sanwo-Olu said the park would have amenities that would make businesses thrive and bring returns on investment to business owners.
