The city of Jaboatão dos Guararapes was founded on 4 May 1593 by Bento Luiz Figueira, the third owner of Engenho São João Baptista. The [[Second Battle of Guararapes]] occurred in the city and was one of the most important battles in Brazil's history, in which the people from Pernambuco defeated and expelled the Dutch from the State. This battle was an important event that led to the creation of the [[Brazilian Army]]. In 1873 it ascended to village status, and in 1884 after being split up with [[Olinda]] it ascended to city status.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
