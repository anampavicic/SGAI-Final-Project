The city extends about {{cvt|40|km|mi|sp=us}} along the [[northern coast of Egypt]] and is the largest city on the Mediterranean, the [[List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Egypt#Largest_cities | second-largest in Egypt]] (after [[Cairo]]), the  [[List of largest cities in the Arab world|fourth-largest city]] in the [[Arab world]], the [[List of cities in Africa by population|ninth-largest city in Africa]], and the [[List of urban agglomerations in Africa|ninth-largest urban area in Africa]].

The city was founded originally in the vicinity of an Egyptian settlement named [[Rhacotis]] (that became the Egyptian quarter of the city). Alexandria grew rapidly, becoming a major centre of Hellenic civilisation and replacing Memphis as Egypt's capital during the reign of the Ptolemaic pharaohs who succeeded Alexander. It retained this status for almost a millennium, through the period of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman and Eastern Roman rule]] until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at [[Fustat]] (later absorbed into [[Cairo]]).

Alexandria was best known for the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (''Pharos''), one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]; its [[Library of Alexandria|Great Library]], the largest in the ancient world; and the [[Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa]], one of the [[Wonders of the Middle Ages|Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages]]. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean for much of the [[Hellenistic age]] and [[late antiquity]].<ref name="PollardReid2007" /> It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by [[Rome]].

The city was a major centre of [[early Christianity|early]] [[Christianity]] and was the centre of the [[Patriarchate of Alexandria]], which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. In the modern world, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] both lay claim to this ancient heritage. By 641, the city had already been largely plundered {{By whom|date=June 2024}} and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era.<ref name="FPAl">{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/23/lighthouse-dims-egypt-alexandria-salafists-mubarak-sisi-longform/ |title=The Lighthouse Dims |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=23 December 2014|access-date=5 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309071911/https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/23/lighthouse-dims-egypt-alexandria-salafists-mubarak-sisi-longform/|archive-date=9 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major centre of the international [[shipping industry]] and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and [[Red Sea]]s and the lucrative trade in [[Gossypium barbadense|Egyptian cotton]].

Alexandria was located on the earlier Egyptian settlement, which was called [[Rhacotis]] ({{Langx|grc|Ῥακῶτις|Rhakôtis}}), the Hellenised form of [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''r-ꜥ-qd(y)t''. As one of many settlements founded by Alexander the Great, the city he founded on Rhacotis was called {{Translit|grc|Alexándreia hḗ kat' Aígypton}} ({{Lang|grc|Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον}}), which some sources translated as "Alexandria by Egypt", as the city was, at that time, in the periphery of Egypt proper (the area beside the [[Nile]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chugg |first1=Andrew M. |title=The Pharos Lighthouse In Alexandria: Second Sun and Seventh Wonder of Antiquity |year=2024 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1-04-000272-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QXsEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT20}}</ref> Some of the Alexandrian and Greek populaces, e.g., [[Hypsicles]], also referred to the city as {{Translit|grc|Alexándreia hḗ prós Aígypton}} ({{Lang|grc|Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ πρός Αἴγυπτον}}, "Alexandria near Egypt").<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Getzel M. |title=The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-08329-5 |pages=409 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6p4lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA409}}</ref> In the course of [[Roman Egypt|Roman rule in Egypt]], the city's name was [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] as {{Lang|la|Alexandrēa ad Aegyptum}}.

As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] and [[Heracleion]]. The latter was recently rediscovered underwater.
Alexandria was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in April 331 BC as {{lang|grc|Ἀλεξάνδρεια}} ({{transliteration|grc|Alexandreia}}), as [[List of cities founded by Alexander the Great|one of his many city foundations]]. After he captured the [[Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian Satrapy]] from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Alexander wanted to build a [[Polis|large Greek city]] on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of [[Pharos]] that would generate two great natural harbours.<ref name="PollardReid2007"/> Alexandria was intended to supersede the older [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] of [[Naucratis]] as a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] centre in Egypt and to be the link between Greece and the rich [[Nile]] valley. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.[[File:Plan of Alexandria c 30 BC Otto Puchstein 1890s EN.svg|thumb|Plan of Alexandria ({{circa|30&nbsp;BC}})|left]]

After Alexander's departure, his [[viceroy]] [[Cleomenes of Naucratis|Cleomenes]] continued the expansion. The architect [[Dinocrates of Rhodes]] designed the city, using a [[Hippodamian]] [[grid plan]]. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy Lagides]] took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him.<ref>O'Connor, Lauren (2009) "The Remains of Alexander the Great: The God, The King, The Symbol", ''Constructing the Past'': Vol. 10: Iss. 1, Article 8</ref> Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself [[Pharaoh]] as Ptolemy I Soter ("Savior") and moved his capital to Alexandria.

Although Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the {{transliteration|grc|[[Heptastadion]]}} and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] work. Inheriting the trade of ruined [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than [[Carthage]]. In one century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with [[Greeks|Greek people]] from diverse backgrounds.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: The Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece & Rome, 2nd Ser. |volume=42 |issue=1 |date=April 1995 |pages=38–48 [42] |quote=One effect of the newly created Hellenistic kingdoms was the imposition of Greek cities occupied by Greeks on an alien landscape.

The [[Septuagint]], a Greek version of the [[Tanakh]], was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic centre of learning ([[Library of Alexandria]], which faced destruction during [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|siege of Alexandria]] in 47 BC), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and Jewish.<ref name="Culture and Power in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] p. 42-43">{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |title=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |journal=Greece & Rome |volume=42 |issue=1 |date=April 1995 |pages=38–48 |doi=10.1017/S0017383500025213 |s2cid=162578339 |url=https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/0250d217-8139-4aca-8a8e-8a701b81b9a2 |quote=The Ptolemaic emphasis on Greek culture establishes the Greeks of Egypt with an identity for themselves.

The assertion of Greek culture serves to enforce Egyptian subjection. So the presence in Alexandria of two institutions devoted to the preservation and study of Greek culture acts as a powerful symbol of Egyptian exclusion and subjection. Texts from other cultures could be kept in the library, but only once they had been translated, that is to say Hellenized.{{pb}}[...] A reading of Alexandrian poetry might easily give the impression that Egyptians did not exist at all; indeed Egypt itself is hardly mentioned except for the Nile and the Nile flood, [...] This omission of the Egypt and Egyptians from poetry masks a fundamental insecurity.

According to [[Philo of Alexandria]], in the year 38 AD, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by King [[Agrippa I]] to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Herodian nation to the [[Roman emperor]], which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. This event has been called the [[Alexandrian riots (38)|Alexandrian pogroms]]. The violence was quelled after [[Caligula]] intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Philo/in_Flaccum*.html Against Flaccus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220510035154/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Philo/in_Flaccum%2A.html |date=10 May 2022 }}.</ref>

In 619, Alexandria [[Sassanid conquest of Egypt|fell]] to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]].

In reference to Alexandria, [[Ibn Battuta]] speaks of a number of [[Muslim saints]] that resided in the city. One such saint was Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj, who was said to perform miracles. Another notable figure was Yaqut al-'Arshi, a disciple of [[Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi|Abu Abbas El Mursi]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |author=Ibn Batuta |title=The travels of Ibn Battuta in the Near East, Asia and Africa 1304–1377 |date=2009 |publisher=Cosimo |isbn=9781605206219 |location=New York |translator=Lee, Samuel |oclc=502998972}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=McGregor |first=Richard J.

Alexandria figured prominently in the military operations of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition to Egypt]] in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the [[Battle of Alexandria (1801)|Battle of Alexandria]] on 21 March 1801, following which they [[Siege of Alexandria (1801)|besieged the city]], which fell to them on 2 September 1801. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810 and, by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory.<ref>"Modern"{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111760/modern.htm |title=The History of Alexandria|url-status=dead|access-date=24 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524173744/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111760/modern.htm|archive-date=24 May 2013}}</ref> Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernise the country.

In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the [[Lavon Affair]]. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmhtthornton.com/mehistorydatabase/nasser_assassination_attempt.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105055521/http://www.nmhtthornton.com/mehistorydatabase/nasser_assassination_attempt.php|archive-date=5 January 2010 |title=Nasser Assassination Attempt, October 26, 1954|url-status=dead|access-date=24 May 2013 |first=Ted |last=Thornton |website=Middle East History Database}}</ref>

Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] that led to an outburst of [[Arab nationalism]]. The nationalisation of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.<ref name="FPAl" />

Due to its location on a Nile river delta, Alexandria is one of the most vulnerable cities to [[sea level rise]] in the entire world. According to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of people in its low-lying areas may already have to be relocated before 2030.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/29/alexandria-little-venice-egypt-climate-change-frontline|title=Houses claimed by the canal: life on Egypt's climate change frontline| last=Michaelson| first=Ruth|date=25 August 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> The 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]] estimates that by 2050, Alexandria and 11 other major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]) would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion for the "moderate" climate change scenario [[Representative Concentration Pathway|RCP 4.5]] and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5, while RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages. Additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.

[[File:Macedonian Army Alexander.jpg|thumb|[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] Army, shown on the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]]]]{{More citations needed section|date=July 2023}}
Greek Alexandria was divided into three regions:
;Rhakotis
:[[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]] (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] {{transliteration|cop|Rakotə}},{{Contradictory inline|date=August 2021|reason=In the introductory sentence, the Coptic name is given as 'Rakodī', with ref. There's no explanation of the discrepancy. A different dialect?}} "Alexandria") was the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians.
:
;Brucheum
:Brucheum was the Royal or Greek quarter and formed the most magnificent portion of the city. In [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]], Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal.
;
;Jewish quarter
:The Jewish quarter was the northeast portion of the city.
[[File:Canopic Street Alexandria 1784 by LF Cassa.png|thumb|[[Engraving]] by L. F. Cassas of the [[Canopic Street]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]], made in 1784]]

Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about {{cvt|sp=us|60|m|ft}} wide, intersected in the centre of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]) rose. This point is very near the present [[mosque]] of [[Nebi Daniel]]; the line of the great East–West "Canopic" street is also present in modern-day Alexandria, having only slightly diverged from the line of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharae Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.[[File:S03 06 01 018 image 2380.jpg|thumb|One of the pair of [[Cleopatra's Needles]] in Alexandria, which were relocated to London and New York in the late 19th century]]Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a {{cvt|1260|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[mole (architecture)|mole]] and called the {{transliteration|grc|Heptastadion}} ("seven stadia"—a ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek [[unit of length]] measuring approximately {{cvt|180|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the "Moon Gate" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern "Ras al-Tin" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour.

In [[Strabo]]'s time (latter half of the 1st century BC), the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbour.

#The [[Palace|Royal Palaces]], filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbour on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the "Private Port", and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land [[subsidence]] here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.
#The Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by [[Julius Caesar]] as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the [[battle of Pharsalus]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{clarify|reason=Caesar retreated from a mob??|date=July 2014}}
#The [[Poseidon]], or [[Greek temple|Temple]] of the Sea God, close to the theater
#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/alexandria/|title=The sunken ancient port of Alexandria|first=Franck Goddio-Underwater|last=Archaeologist|website=Franck Goddio - Underwater Archaeologist}}</ref>
#The Emporium (Exchange)
#The Apostases (Magazines)
#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole
#Behind the Emporium rose the [[Caesareum of Alexandria|Great Caesareum]], by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s which became known as "[[Cleopatra's Needle]]s" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.
#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.
#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; site unknown.
#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.
#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theater in the same region; site unknown.
#The [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near "Pompey's Pillar", which was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.

The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be {{cvt|138|m|ft}} high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]) completed it, at a total cost of 800&nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s. It took 12&nbsp;years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.

In the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens,<ref>Rostovtzeff 1941: (1138–39)</ref> according to a census dated from 32 AD, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000<ref>Josiah Russell, 1958, "Late Ancient and Medieval Population", pp. 67 and 79.</ref> to 500,000,<ref>[[Elio Lo Cascio]], 2009, "Urbanization as a Proxy of Growth", p. 97, citing Bagnall and Frier.</ref> making it one of the largest cities ever built before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Cityscape==
Due to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.

=== Pompey's Pillar ===
[[File:Alex Sawary.jpg|thumb|right|Roman [[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]]]"[[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]", a [[Roman triumphal column]], is one of the best-known [[ancient monument]]s still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient [[acropolis]]—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab [[cemetery]]—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its [[pedestal]], it is 30&nbsp;m (99&nbsp;ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, {{cvt|2.7|m|ft|1}} in diameter at the base, tapering to {{cvt|2.4|m|ft|1}} at the top. The shaft is {{cvt|sp=us|88|ft|m}} high and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is {{cvt|132|sp=us|m3|0|abbr=off}} and weight approximately 396 tons.<ref>[[Egyptian pyramids|The Pyramids]] and Sphinx by Desmond Stewart and editors of the Newsweek Book Division 1971 p. 80-81</ref> Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient [[obelisk]]s. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several [[Obelisks#Obelisk erecting experiments|obelisk erecting experiments]] including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; 27 August 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=PBS |date=27 August 1999|access-date=5 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430023706/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html|archive-date=30 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[[Time–Life|Time Life]] Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993)p. 56-57</ref>

=== Kom El Deka ===
[[File:AlexandriaAmphitheatre.jpg|thumb|Roman Theater]]
The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as [[Kom El Deka]]. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its [[Thermae|Roman-era baths]].

===Temple of Taposiris Magna===
{{Main|Abusir (Lake Mariout)}}
[[File:Magna temple1.JPG|thumb|right|Side view of The Temple of [[Taposiris Magna]]]]The temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine [[Pharos Lighthouse]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=McKenzie |first1=Judith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFNCaZEZKYAC |title=The Architecture of Alexandria and Egypt, C. 300 B.C. to A.D. 700 |last2=McKenzie |first2=Rhys-Davids Junior Research Fellow in Archaeology Judith |last3=Moorey |first3=Peter Roger Stuart |date=2007-01-01 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-11555-0 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Citadel of Qaitbay ===
[[File:Citadel of Qaitbay, Alexandria, Egypt.jpg|thumb|Citadel of Qaitbay]]
[[Citadel of Qaitbay]] is a defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast. It was established in 1477 AD (882 [[Hijri year|AH]]) by the [[Mamluk Sultanate|mamluk]] Sultan [[Qaitbay|Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa'it Bay]]. The Citadel is located on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the [[Eastern Harbour (Alexandria)|Eastern Harbour]]. It was erected on the exact site of the famous [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], which was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. It was built on an area of 17,550 [[square metre]]s.

== Excavation ==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2023}}

Persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Society and by many individuals. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=New clues to the lost tomb of Alexander the Great discovered in Egypt |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/lost-tomb-alexander-great |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210223223313/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/lost-tomb-alexander-great |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 February 2021 |website=National Geographic|date=28 February 2019 }}</ref>
The past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.

Since the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. [[Cleopatra VII]]'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual [[subsidence]] in the 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite web |title=Discovering the Portus Magnus of Alexandria |url=https://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/alexandria/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307175057/http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |archive-date=7 March 2010 |access-date=2 November 2022}}</ref> This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] and his [[Institut Européen d'Archéologie Sous-Marine|team]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://livestream.com/oxuni/goddio?t=1678727041|title=The Portus Magnus of Alexandria: 25 years of underwater archaeological research by University of Oxford Live|via=livestream.com}}</ref> It raised a noted head of [[Caesarion]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Colossal head of Caesarion |url=https://www.franckgoddio.org/fileadmin/pics/3_5_finds/documents/Franck_Goddio_Caesarion.pdf |access-date=2 November 2022 |website=}}</ref> These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/940333.stm |title=New underwater tourist attraction in Egypt |work=BBC News |date=24 September 2000|access-date=19 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318091331/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/940333.stm|archive-date=18 March 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman [[stratum|strata]].

The most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighbourhood of "Pompey's Pillar", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense [[catacombs]] and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.

The objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in [[Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa|Kom El Shoqafa]] (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).

The German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of [[Kom El Deka]], which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.

The making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered.

[[File:StCatherineChurchAlexandria.jpg|thumb|[[St. Catherine's Cathedral, Alexandria|Saint Catherine's Latin Catholic Cathedral]]]]
Alexandria was once considered the third-most important see in [[Christianity]], after [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]]. Until 430, the Patriarch of Alexandria was second only to the [[bishop of Rome]]. The [[Church of Alexandria]] had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, the Alexandrian Church split between the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] and the [[Melkite]]s. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In the 19th century, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.

Today the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|Saint Mark Cathedral]] (though in practice the Patriarch has long resided in Cairo). The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include [[Cyril of Alexandria|Pope Cyril I]] Church in Cleopatra, [[Saint George]]'s Church in Sporting, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] and [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Pope Peter I]] Church in Sidi Bishr, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, [[Saint Menas|Saint Mina]] Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|Saint Takla Haymanot's Church]] in Ibrahimeya.

The most important [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches in Alexandria are [[Holy Unmercenaries|Agioi Anárgyroi]] Church, Church of the [[Annunciation]], [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] Church, Archangels [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Church, Taxiarchon Church, [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] Church, Cathedral of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] Church, [[Saint George]] Church, [[Saint Joseph]] Church in Fleming, [[Joseph of Arimathea|Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] Church, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] and [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nektarios]] Chapel in Ramleh, [[Saint Nicholas]] Church, [[Paraskevi of Rome|Saint Paraskevi]] Church, [[Saint Sava]] Cathedral in Ramleh, [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] Chapel and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] church of [[Alexander Nevsky|Saint Alexander Nevsky]] in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.

The [[Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said]] has jurisdiction over all [[Latin Church|Latin Catholics]] in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic]] [[Melkite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch|titular Patriarchate of Alexandria]] (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its [[Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan]], which uses the [[Byzantine Rite]], and the nominal see of the [[Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria]] (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the [[Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]], using the [[Armenian Rite]].
	
The Saint Mark Church in [[Shatby]], founded as part of [[Collège Saint Marc, Alexandria|Collège Saint Marc]], is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and Coptic Orthodox rites.

In antiquity Alexandria was a major centre of the cosmopolitan religious movement called [[Gnosticism]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The School of Alexandria |url=https://www.copticchurch.net/patrology/schoolofalex/I-Intro/chapter4.html}}</ref> (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).

===Judaism===
[[File:Eliyahu-Hanavi-Synagogue.jpg|thumb|[[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]]]]
Alexandria's Jewish community declined rapidly following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], after which negative reactions towards [[Zionism]] among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt moved to the newly settled [[Israel]], [[France]], [[Brazil]] and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s.  The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50.<ref>[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue Egypt to restore Alexandria's historic synagogue], (20 December 2010) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224165555/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue|date=24 December 2010 }}</ref> The most important [[synagogue]] in Alexandria is the [[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]].

Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its [[Alexandria Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] & [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]]. In addition, the [[Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology]] in [[New Borg El Arab]] city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010. The [[Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport]] is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students.

Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include [[Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology|Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT)]] and [[Pharos University in Alexandria]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=25 Best Universities in Alexandria - Top Ratings (2023 Fees) |url=https://www.edarabia.com/universities/alexandria/ |access-date=2023-12-11 |website=edarabia.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Schools===
[[File:Lycee Francais d'Alexandrie 2001.JPG|thumb|[[Lycée Français d'Alexandrie]]]]
Alexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by [[Catholic]] missionaries include Collège de la Mère de Dieu, Collège Notre Dame de Sion, [[Collège Saint Marc, Alexandria|Collège Saint Marc]], Écoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), École Girard, École Saint Gabriel, École Saint-Vincent de Paul, École Saint Joseph, École Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lycée Français d'Alexandrie (École Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto "Don Bosco".

English-language schools in Alexandria are the most popular; those in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, [https://www.forsan.edu.eg/?Itemid=645 Forsan American School], [https://www.forsan.edu.eg/ Forsan International School], Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, [[British School of Alexandria]], Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, [[Egyptian English Language School]], Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Zahran Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, [[Schutz American School, Alexandria|Schutz American School]], [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]], [[Manar English Girls School|El Manar Language School for Girls]] (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and [[El Nasr Girls' College]] (previously called English Girls' College).
There are only two German schools in Alexandria which are [[Deutsche Schule der Borromäerinnen Alexandria|Deutsche Schule der Borromärinnen]] (DSB of Saint Charles Borromé) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.

The [[Montessori education|Montessori]] educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.

===Women===
Around the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like ''al-Fatāh'' by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's journal, appeared.<ref name=Kendallp340>Kendall, Elisabeth.

==Culture==

===Libraries===
[[File:Bibliotheca Alexandrina plaza 003.jpg|thumb|The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The Royal [[Library of Alexandria]], in Alexandria, [[Egypt]], was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II of Egypt]]. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the [[Muse]]s—the [[Musaeum|Museion]], Greek ''Μουσείον'' (from which the [[Modern English]] word ''[[Museum#Etymology|museum]]'' is derived).

It has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day, the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Raven |first1=James |title=Lost Libraries: The Destruction of Great Book Collections Since Antiquity |date=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0230524257 |page=12}}</ref>

The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/10/dayintech-1016bibliotheca/ |title=Oct. 16, 2002: Second Great Library Opens in Alexandria |first=Tony |last=Long |magazine=Wired |date=16 October 2009 |access-date=20 January 2020 |archive-date=25 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725025956/https://www.wired.com/2009/10/dayintech-1016bibliotheca/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
