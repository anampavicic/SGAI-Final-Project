==Etymology==
There are three theories about the name Jahrom. Based on [[Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan]], in which Jahrom is mentioned as "Zarham"; It is probable that Jahrom means "green space".<ref>{{cite web |title=Jahrom' |website=Encyclopedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jahrom |access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Based on Ahmad Kasravi, the late Iranian historian and [[Philology|philologist]], the name Jahrom can be analyzed to render a "warm-place".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jahrom.org/htmls/history.html |title=Jahrom History |access-date=2009-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206155148/http://www.jahrom.org/htmls/history.html |archive-date=2011-02-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Jahrom consists of "Ja" and "Hrom", Ja means "place" and "Hrom" in [[Avestan]] means "high and forbidden fortress", which is other name of the city of Barzeh (the current [[Takht-e Soleymān]]) In [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], near the city of [[Maragheh]].

=== Nicknames ===
"Green umbrella" is a nickname of Jahrom due to the resemblance of the huge masses of [[Arecaceae|palm]] trees of Jahrom to green umbrellas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iranboom.ir/gardesh-gari/17419-jahrom-980127-027.html |title=Jahrom |website=Iran Boom |access-date=2020-04-08 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> "Dar ol-Momenin" is the other nickname which means "house of faithful people" because of high percentage of [[Islam]] believers in the city.

Jahrom is also known as the "City of Sour Gold" due to production of [[Persian lime|lime]] and the "Land of Palms and Oranges", which are the two well-known plant species of the city and surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.farsnews.ir/amp/13910725001135 |title=Jahrom must stay faithful |website=Fars news |access-date=2020-04-08 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:قدمگاه جهرم.JPG|220px|thumb|right|Qadamgah in Jahrom]]
Jahrom's history goes back some 2500 years when the [[Achaemenid]]s established the [[Persian Empire]]. The establishment of the city is attributed to [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]]. The [[Sassanid]] monument of Qadamgāh is located to the south of the city, experts believe the monument was constructed during the late Sasanian dynastic era (224-651 AD), and it was a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] shrine, probably a fire temple. Jahrom is the birthplace of [[Barbod]], who became the main [[lyricist]] and musician in the [[Royal court|court]] of the great Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]] (Parviz).

Jahrom was [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered by the Muslims]] in 641 or 644 after a fierce battle. "The Valley of the Martyrs" in west of the city was the site of this battle, which is why it is called so. As it is described in [[Fars-Nama]], Jahrom's taxes were paid to the [[Crown prince|Crown Prince]] during the [[Buyid]] period. In the late [[Safavid]] and early [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] periods, was the start date of planting trees in Jahrom, specially [[Arecaceae|palm]] trees.

During the [[Qajar]] period, the ruler of this city began to build buildings and places for urban affairs, including the construction of the bazaar, as well as numerous [[caravanserai]]s and the development of the city. In 1887, [[Mohammad Hassan Mirza|Mohammad Hassan Mirza Mohandes]], introduced Jahrom as the largest and most prosperous city in Persia after [[Shiraz]] and [[Bushehr]]. Etemad os-Saltanah describes Jahrom in the late [[Qajar]] period a larger city than cities like [[Qom]] and [[Kashan]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite web | url=https://rch.ac.ir/article/Details/7739 | title=Jahrom | publisher=Islamic World Encyclopedia | access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> People of Jahrom had an important rule in [[tobacco protest]]s of 1890 and [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of early 20th century. [[Abd al-Husayn Najafi Lari]] was the Islamic leader of the city in this period.

Jahrom also had an important role in the [[Islamic revolution of Iran]] and was one of the 11 cities with [[martial law]] in pre-revolution protests. [[Seyyed Hossein ayatollahi]] was the Islamic leader of Jahrom in that period. A soldier killed the military governor of Jahrom on the birthday of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] on October 6, 1978. 1,200 people of Jahrom were martyred during [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref name="mehromah">{{cite web | url=http://home.mehromah.ir/fun/touring-iran/4010-Urban-arranged-in-the-East-Empire-of-Ardashir.html | title=Jahrom, a city in the east of Ardeshir's empire | access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="Martyrs">{{cite web | url=https://defapress.ir/fa/news/225110/%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-11-%D8%B4%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8 | title=Jahrom county with 11 Martyrs | publisher=Defa press | access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>
