The ancient history of Gujarat was enriched by the commercial activities of its inhabitants. There is clear historical evidence of trade and commerce ties with [[Egypt]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Sumer]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the time period of 1000 to 750 BCE.<ref name="mapsofindia.com" /><ref>S. R. Rao (1985). Lothal. Archaeological Survey of India. p. 11.</ref> There was a succession of various polities such as the [[Mauryan dynasty]], [[Satavahana dynasty]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] Empire, as well as regional ones such as the [[Western Satraps]], the [[Kingdom of Valabhi]], the [[Kingdom of Gujarat]], the [[Sultanate of Gujarat]] and finally the [[Kingdom of Baroda]].

The early history of Gujarat includes the imperial grandeur of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] who conquered a number of earlier states in what is now Gujarat. Pushyagupta, a [[Vaishya]], was appointed the governor of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day [[Junagadh]]) (322 BCE to 294 BCE) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]], the grandson of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], not only ordered his edicts engraved in the rock at Junagadh, but also asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Indian governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the [[Samprati]] Mauryas of [[Ujjain]], there was an [[Indo-Greek]] defeat in Gujarat of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]]. In 16th century manuscripts, there is an apocryphal story of a merchant of King [[Gondophares]] landing in Gujarat with [[Apostle Thomas]]. The incident of the cup-bearer torn apart by a lion might indicate that the port city described is in Gujarat.<ref>The Acts of Judas Thomas, M.R. James, Tr. by M.R. James, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924.</ref><ref>Medlycott, A. E.

For nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century CE, [[Saka]] rulers played a prominent part in Gujarat's history. The weather-beaten rock at [[Junagadh]] gives a glimpse of the ruler [[Rudradaman I]] (100 CE) of the Saka satraps known as [[Western Satraps]], or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap [[Rudradaman I]] founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from [[Anupa]] on the banks of the [[Narmada]] up to the [[Aparanta]] region bordering Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the Indian dynasties such as the [[Satavahana dynasty]] and the Western Satraps. The greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.<ref>Trade And Trade Routes In Ancient India, von Moti Chandra, page: 99</ref>

The Kshatrapa dynasty was replaced by the [[Gupta Empire]] with the conquest of Gujarat by [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]]. Vikramaditya's successor [[Skandagupta]] left an inscription (450 CE) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The [[Anarta]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 set up the [[Kingdom of Valabhi]]. He shifted his capital from Giringer to [[Valabhi]], near [[Bhavnagar]], on Saurashtra's east coast. The [[Maitraka]]s of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining [[Malwa]]. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted [[Nalanda University]]. It was during the rule of Dhruvasena Maitrak that Chinese philosopher-traveler [[Xuanzang]]/ [[I Tsing]] visited in 640 along the [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mote |first=Sally Hovey Wriggins; with a foreword by Frederick W. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwQLAAAAYAAJ |title=Xuanzang : a Buddhist pilgrim on the Silk Road |date=1996 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-8133-2801-0 |location=Boulder, Colo. |access-date=22 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190304110046/https://books.google.com/books?id=RwQLAAAAYAAJ |archive-date=4 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Gujarat was known to the [[ancient Greeks]] and was familiar with other Western centers of civilisation through the end of the European [[Middle Ages]].

=== Medieval history ===
In the early 8th century, the [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] established an empire in the name of the rising religion of [[Islam]], which stretched from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and modern-day Pakistan in the east. Al-Junaid, the successor of [[Muhammad ibn Qasim|Qasim]], finally subdued the Hindu resistance within [[Sindh]] and established a secure base. The Arab rulers tried to expand their empire southeast, which culminated in the [[Caliphate campaigns in India]] fought in 730; they were defeated and expelled west of the [[Indus]] river, probably by a coalition of the Indian rulers [[Nagabhata I]] of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] dynasty, [[Vikramaditya II]] of the [[Chalukya]] dynasty and [[Bappa Rawal]] of the [[Guhila dynasty]]. After this victory, the Arab invaders were driven out of Gujarat. General [[Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin|Pulakeshin]], a Chalukya prince of [[Lata (region)|Lata]], received the title ''Avanijanashraya'' (refuge of the people of the earth) and honorific of "Repeller of the unrepellable" by the Chalukya emperor [[Vikramaditya II]] for his victory at the battle at [[Navsari]], where the Arab troops suffered a crushing defeat.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Blankinship |first=Khalid Yahya |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNGq6sU-xbgC&pg=PA187 |title=The end of the jihād state : the reign of Hishām ibn ʻAbd al-Malik and the collapse of the Umayyads |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-7914-1828-4 |location=Albany |page=189 |quote=The Syrian troops became increasingly reluctant to serve on the ill-omened Indian front, which seemed, after so many failures, to be well on its way to becoming the worst front. |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190304110046/https://books.google.com/books?id=pNGq6sU-xbgC&pg=PA187 |archive-date=4 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Early 14th-century [[Maghrebi]] adventurer, [[Ibn Batuta]], who famously visited India with his entourage, recalls in his memoirs about Cambay, one of the great emporia of the Indian Ocean that indeed:

{{blockquote| [[Cambay]] is one of the most beautiful cities as regards the artistic architecture of its houses and the construction of its mosques.

Aurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace. Muhammad Azam was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat.<ref name="DNA_May2012"/>

=== Maratha Empire ===

When the cracks had started to develop in the edifice of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the mid-17th century, the [[Maratha Confederacy|Marathas]] were consolidating their power in the west, [[Chatrapati Shivaji]], the great Maratha ruler, attacked Surat in southern Gujarat twice first in 1664 and again in 1672.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Patel |first=Aakar |date=6 April 2012 |title=Blame the British Raj on bankers – Livemint |url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/zgaDxyMuIrH3QWHElwkX3M/Blame-the-British-Raj-on-bankers.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807152732/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/zgaDxyMuIrH3QWHElwkX3M/Blame-the-British-Raj-on-bankers.html |archive-date=7 August 2017 |access-date=7 August 2017 |website=livemint.com |publisher=Livemint}}</ref> These attacks marked the entry of the Marathas into Gujarat. However, before the Maratha had made inroads into Gujarat, the Europeans had made their presence felt, led by the Portuguese, and followed by the Dutch and the English.

The [[Peshwa]]s had established sovereignty over parts of Gujarat and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives. [[Damaji Rao Gaekwad]] and [[Kadam (clan)|Kadam]] Bande divided the Peshwa territory between them,<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/60443/8/08_chapter%204.pdf |title=MULTIPLE AUTHORITIES – DISPUTED SOVEREIGNTY |access-date=7 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807152712/http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/60443/8/08_chapter%204.pdf |archive-date=7 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> with Damaji establishing the sway of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwad]] over Gujarat and making [[Baroda]] (present day [[Vadodara]] in southern Gujarat) his capital. The ensuing internecine war among the Marathas was fully exploited by the British, who interfered in the affairs of both Gaekwads and the Peshwas.

In [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], as elsewhere, the Marathas were met with resistance.<ref name="cpc">{{Cite book |last1=Behera |first1=Deepak Kumar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R--XMUsk7sIC&pg=PA198 |title=The concept of tribal society |last2=Pfeffer |first2=Georg |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=2002 |isbn=9788170229834 |page=198}}</ref> The decline of the [[Mughal Empire]] helped form larger peripheral states in Saurashtra, including [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]], [[Nawanagar State|Jamnagar]], [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]] and a few others, which largely resisted the Maratha incursions.<ref name=cpc />

=== European colonialism, 1614–1947 ===
[[File:Portuguese possessions in the Province of North.jpg|thumb|Territory ceded by the [[Gujarat Sultanate|Sultanate of Gujarat]] to Portugal in 1534 according to the [[Treaty of Bassein (1534)|Treaty of Bassein]].]]

In the 1600s, the Dutch, French, English and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] all established bases along the western coast of the region. Portugal was the first European power to arrive in Gujarat, and after the [[Battle of Diu]], acquired several enclaves along the Gujarati coast, including [[Daman and Diu]] as well as [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. These enclaves were administered by [[Portuguese India]] under a single union territory for over 450 years, only to be later incorporated into the [[Republic of India]] on 19 December 1961 by military conquest.

The [[British East India Company]] established a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Surat]] in 1614 following the commercial treaty made with Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim [[Jahangir]], which formed their first base in India, but it was eclipsed by [[Mumbai|Bombay]] after the English received it from Portugal in 1668 as part of the marriage treaty of [[Charles II of England]] and [[Catherine of Braganza]], daughter of [[King John IV of Portugal]]. The state was an early point of contact with the west, and the first British commercial [[Outpost (military)|outpost]] in India was in Gujarat.<ref name="wingsbirds.com">[http://wingsbirds.com/tours/india-west-gujarat-rann-kutch/ WINGS Birding Tours to India: the West – Gujarat and the Rann of Kutch – Itinerary] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730052857/http://wingsbirds.com/tours/india-west-gujarat-rann-kutch/ |date=30 July 2013 }}.

17th-century French explorer [[François Pyrard de Laval]], who is remembered for his 10-year sojourn in South Asia, bears witness in his account that the Gujaratis were always prepared to learn workmanship from the Portuguese, and in turn imparted skills to the Portuguese:<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Rai |first1=Rajesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb_X3L96AfgC&pg=PA31 |title=The South Asian diaspora transnational networks and changing identities |last2=Reeves, Peter |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-203-89235-0 |location=London |page=31 |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190304110046/https://books.google.com/books?id=zb_X3L96AfgC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31 |archive-date=4 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In fact, the ''Portuguese'' take and learn more from them than they from the ''Portuguese''.}}

Later in the 17th century, Gujarat came under control of the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] that arose, defeating the Muslim Mughals who had dominated the politics of India. Most notably, from 1705 to 1716, [[Senapati]] [[Khanderao Dabhade]] led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. [[Pilaji Gaekwad]], first ruler of [[Gaekwad dynasty]], established the control over Baroda and other parts of Gujarat.

The [[British East India Company]] wrested control of much of Gujarat from the Marathas during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] in 1802–1803. Many local rulers, notably the Maratha Gaekwad Maharajas of Baroda ([[Vadodara]]), made a separate peace with the British and acknowledged British sovereignty in return for retaining local self-rule.

An epidemic in 1812 killed half the population of Gujarat.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Petersen |first1=Eskild |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPEjDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 |title=Infectious Diseases: A Geographic Guide |last2=Chen |first2=Lin Hwei |last3=Schlagenhauf-Lawlor |first3=Patricia |date=14 February 2017 |isbn=9781119085737 |page=8 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903073809/https://books.google.com/books?id=VPEjDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 |archive-date=3 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Gujarat was placed under the political authority of the [[Bombay Presidency]], with the exception of [[Baroda State]], which had a direct relationship with the [[Governor-General of India]]. From 1818 to 1947, most of present-day Gujarat, including [[Kathiawar]], Kutch and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of [[princely states]], but several districts in central and southern Gujarat, namely [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmedabad]], Broach ([[Bharuch district|Bharuch]]), Kaira ([[Kheda district|Kheda]]), [[Panchmahal district|Panchmahal]] and [[Surat district|Surat]], were governed directly by British officials. In 1819, [[Swaminarayan|Sahajanand Swami]] established the World's First [[Swaminarayan Temple, Ahmedabad|Swaminarayan Mandir]] in [[Kalupur]], [[Ahmedabad]].

Initially there was confusion over whether Junagadh would join India or Pakistan. This was resolved in 1947 with a [[plebiscite]] for full union with India following the next year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/research/five-states-that-refused-to-join-india-after-independence/ |title=Five states that refused to join India after Independence |date=August 2017 |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220113171155/https://indianexpress.com/article/research/five-states-that-refused-to-join-india-after-independence/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

After [[Independence of India|Indian independence]] and the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the new Indian government grouped the former princely states of Gujarat into three larger units; [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], which included the former princely states on the [[Kathiawad]] peninsula, [[Kutch]], and [[Bombay state]], which included the former British districts of Bombay Presidency together with most of [[Baroda State]] and the other former princely states of eastern Gujarat. Bombay state was enlarged to include Kutch, Saurashtra (Kathiawar) and parts of [[Hyderabad state]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] in central India. The new state had a mostly Gujarati-speaking north and a Marathi-speaking south. Agitation by Gujarati nationalists, the [[Mahagujarat Movement]], and Marathi nationalists, the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra]], for their own states led to the split of [[Bombay state]] on linguistic lines; on 1 May 1960, it became the new states of Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]].

Gujarat borders the [[Tharparkar District|Tharparkar]], [[Badin District|Badin]] and [[Thatta District|Thatta]] districts of [[Pakistan]]'s [[Sindh]] province to the northwest, is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the southwest, the state of [[Rajasthan]] to the northeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and by Maharashtra, the [[Union Territory]] of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu]] to the south. Historically, the north was known as [[Anarta]], the Kathiawar peninsula, "Saurastra", and the south as "Lata".<ref>P. Page xvii ''Historical and Cultural Chronology of Gujarat'' edited by Manjulal Ranchholdlal Majmudar</ref> Gujarat was also known as Pratichya and Varuna.<ref>P. 391 ''The Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism'' by Benjamin Walker</ref> The Arabian Sea makes up the state's western coast. The capital, Gandhinagar is a [[planned city]]. Gujarat has an area of {{cvt|75686|sqmi|km2}} with the longest coastline (24% of Indian sea coast) {{cvt|1600|km}}, dotted with 41 ports: one major, 11 intermediate and 29 minor.

The [[Narmada River|Narmada]] is the largest river in Gujarat followed by the [[Tapti River|Tapi]]. The [[Sabarmati River|Sabarmati]] has the longest course through the state.
The Sardar Sarovar Project is built on Narmada, one of the major rivers of [[peninsular India]] where it is one of only three major rivers that run from east to west &ndash; the others being the Tapi and the [[Mahi River|Mahi]]. It is about {{cvt|1312|km}} long. Several riverfront embankments have been built on the Sabarmati River.

The eastern borders have fringes of low mountains of India, the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]], [[Western Ghats|Sahyadri (Western Ghats)]], [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] and [[Saputara]]. Apart from this the Gir hills, Barda, Jessore and [[Chotila]] together make up a large minority of Gujarat. [[Girnar]] is the tallest peak and [[Saputara]] is the only hill-station (hilltop resort) in the state.

=== Rann of Kutch ===
{{Main|Rann of Kutch}}
Rann (રણ) is Gujarati for desert. The Rann of Kutch is a seasonally marshy saline clay desert in the [[Thar Desert]] biogeographic region between the Pakistani province of [[Sindh]] and the rest of the state of Gujarat; it commences {{cvt|8|km}} from the village of Kharaghoda, Surendranagar District.

Gujarat is governed by a [[Gujarat Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of 182 members. Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of adult suffrage from one of 182 constituencies, of which 13 are reserved for [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and 27 for [[scheduled tribe]]s. The term of office for a member of the Legislative Assembly is five years. The Legislative Assembly elects a speaker who presides over the meetings of the legislature. A governor is appointed by the [[President of India]], and is to address the state legislature after every general election and the commencement of each year's first session of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the majority party or coalition in the legislature (Chief Minister) or his or her designee acts as the Leader of the Legislative Assembly. The administration of the state is led by the Chief Minister.

After the [[independence of India]] in 1947, the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) ruled the [[Bombay State]] (which included present-day Gujarat and Maharashtra). Congress continued to govern Gujarat after the state's creation in 1960.

During and after India's [[The Emergency (India)|State of Emergency of 1975–1977]], public support for the INC eroded, but it continued to hold government until 1995 with the brief rule of nine months by [[Janata Morcha]]. In the 1995 Assembly elections, the Congress lost to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led by [[Keshubhai Patel]] who became the Chief Minister. His government lasted only two years. The fall of that government was provoked by a split in the BJP led by [[Shankersinh Vaghela]]. BJP again won election in 1998 with clear majority.

Gujarat is the main producer of tobacco, cotton, and groundnuts in India. Other major food crops produced are rice, wheat, ''jowar, bajra'', maize, ''tur'', and ''gram''. The state has an agricultural economy; the total crop area amounts to more than one-half of the total land area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Gujarat State Agriculture Marketing Board |url=http://agri.gujarat.gov.in/gujarati/boards_corporations/gs-agri-mark-board/agri_profile.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204125421/http://agri.gujarat.gov.in/gujarati/boards_corporations/gs-agri-mark-board/agri_profile.htm |archive-date=4 February 2011 |access-date=16 July 2010 |publisher=Agri.gujarat.gov.in}}</ref>

Animal husbandry and dairying have played vital roles in the rural economy of Gujarat. Dairy farming, primarily concerned with milk production, functions on a co-operative basis and has more than a million members. Gujarat is the largest producer of milk in India. The [[Amul]] milk co-operative federation is well known all over India, and it is Asia's biggest dairy.<ref>{{Cite news |date=14 September 2006 |title=Amul to become world's largest liquid milk brand-Food-Cons.

As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97&nbsp;million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002–03, Gujarat produced 6.09&nbsp;million tonnes of milk, 385&nbsp;million eggs and 2.71&nbsp;million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries.

The adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy [[cooperative]]s. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilethe success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilethey have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilelimiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ebrahim |first=Alnoor |year=2000 |title=Agricultural cooperatives in Gujarat, India: Agents of equity or differentiation? |journal=Development in Practice |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=178–188 |doi=10.1080/09614520050010214 |s2cid=154497407}}</ref> An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of [[Amul]] (Anand Milk Union Limited).

70% of Gujarat's area is classified as semi-arid to arid climatically, thus the demand on water from various economic activities puts a strain on the supply.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Suran |first=B |date=10 June 2012 |title=Is Agriculture in Gujarat on a Different Growth Trajectory? |journal=Social Science Research Network |publisher=National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) |ssrn=2080876}}</ref> Of the total gross irrigated area, 16–17% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83–84% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with [[overdrafting|groundwater depletion]], especially after demand for water increased in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, while only 37.5% of all districts has "safe" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gulati |first=Ashok |url=http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20&%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf |title=Agriculture performance in Gujarat since 2000 |publisher=International Water Management Institute & International Food Policy Research Institute |year=2009 |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221231/http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20%26%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. In 2012 Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area, by constructing solar panels over the canals. In a one megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9&nbsp;million litres of water per year.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sharma |first=D.C. |date=June 2012 |title=India Launches Solar Power Project |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |volume=10 |issue=5 |page=230 |doi=10.1890/i1540-9295-10-5-228 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

The Government of Gujarat, to improve [[soil management]] and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a [[Soil Health Card]]. This acts like a ration card, providing permanent identification for the status of cultivated land, as well as farmers' names, account numbers, survey numbers, [[soil fertility]] status and general fertiliser dose. Samples of land from each village are taken and analysed by the [[Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers|Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertiliser Corporation]], State Fertiliser Corporation and [[Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited|Indian Farmers Fertilisers Co-operative]]. 1,200,000 [[soil test]] data from the villages was collected as of 2008, from farmer's field villages have gone into a database. Assistance and advice for this project was given by local agricultural universities and crop and soil-specific data was added to the database. This allows the soil test data to be interpreted and recommendations or adjustments made in terms of fertiliser requirements, which are also added to the database.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Attri |first=S.D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmqIGTngveIC&pg=PA266 |title=Challenges and Opportunities in Agrometeorology |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |isbn=978-3-642-19360-6 |location=Heidelberg |page=265 |access-date=8 August 2020 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414105621/https://books.google.com/books?id=tmqIGTngveIC&pg=PA266 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Diffusion of culture ===

Due to close proximity to the Arabian Sea, Gujarat has developed a mercantile ethos which maintained a cultural tradition of [[seafaring]], long-distance trade, and overseas contacts with the outside world since ancient times, and the diffusion of culture through Gujarati [[diaspora]] was a logical outcome of such a tradition. During the pre-modern period, various European sources have observed that these merchants formed diaspora communities outside of Gujarat, and in many parts of the world, such as the [[Persian Gulf]], Middle East, [[Horn of Africa]], Hong Kong, [[Indonesia]], and [[Philippines]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Rai |first1=Rajesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb_X3L96AfgC&pg=PA41 |title=The South Asian Diaspora: Transnational networks and changing identities |last2=Reeves |first2=Peter |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-203-89235-0 |editor-last=Rajesh Rai, Peter Reeves |page=41 |quote=The Gujarati merchant diaspora can still be found in the littoral cities of West Asia and Africa on the one hand and in Southeast Asia on the other. |access-date=8 August 2020 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414153225/https://books.google.com/books?id=zb_X3L96AfgC&pg=PA41 |url-status=live }}</ref> long before the internal rise of the [[Maratha]] dynasty, and the [[British Raj]] colonial occupation.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 December 2012 |title=Even British were envious of Gujaratis |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/Even-British-were-envious-of-Gujaratis/articleshow/17575976.cms |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928112046/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-11/vadodara/35748553_1_gujaratis-maritime-history-subcontinent |archive-date=28 September 2013 |access-date=25 September 2013 |website=[[The Times of India]] |quote="Most people perceive that British dominated everything in the 19th century when the Indian sub-continent was under their control.

As financers, they (Gujarati merchants) had agents to collect tax, they had money to provide loans, they dominated the merchandise business and they were also into slavery business at [[Nairobi]], [[Mombasa]], [[Zanzibar]] on the East African coast and to some extent their influence was also on the South African region," he said. "In fact, the dominance of Gujarati merchants on economy was to such an extent that at one point of time the British even complained about it.

Early 1st-century Western historians such as [[Strabo]] and [[Dio Cassius]] are testament to Gujarati people's role in the spread of Buddhism in the Mediterranean, when it was recorded that the ''[[Shramana|sramana]]'' monk [[Zarmanochegas]] (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) of [[Barygaza]] met [[Nicholas of Damascus]] in [[Antioch]] while Augustus ruled the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to [[Athens]] where died by [[self-immolation|setting himself on fire]] to demonstrate his faith.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Strabo, Geography, NOTICE. |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&layout=&loc=15.1.73 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004061428/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&layout=&loc=15.1.73 |archive-date=4 October 2008 |access-date=20 December 2014 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Cassius Dio – Book 54 |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html |access-date=20 December 2014 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |archive-date=25 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220925090709/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54%2A.html |url-status=live }}</ref> A tomb to the ''sramana'', was still visible in the time of [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch.

[[File:Tarnetar Fair 09.jpg|thumb|A man in traditional costumes during [[Tarnetar]] fair]]

A five-day festival is held during [[Maha Shivaratri]] at the fort of [[Girnar]], Junagadh, known as the Bhavanth Mahadev Fair (Gujarati: ભવનાથ નો મેળો). The Kutch Festival or Rann Festival (Gujarati: કચ્છ or રણ ઉત્સવ) is a festival celebrated at Kutch during [[Mahashivratri]]. The ''Modhra Dance Festival'' is a festival for classical dance, arranged by the [[Government of Gujarat]]'s Cultural Department, to promote tourism in state and to keep traditions and culture alive.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Modhra Dance Festival |url=http://www.gujaratindia.com/about-gujarat/modhera-festival.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302202810/http://www.gujaratindia.com/about-gujarat/modhera-festival.htm |archive-date=2 March 2012 |access-date=14 February 2012 |publisher=[[Government of Gujarat]]}}</ref>

The Ambaji Fair is held in the Hindu month of Bhadrapad (around August–September) at Ambaji, during a time which is particularly suitable for farmers, when the busy monsoon season is about to end. The Bhadrapad fair is held at Ambaji which is in the Danta Taluka of Banaskantha district, near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway. Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45&nbsp;km away), Palanpur (65&nbsp;km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5&nbsp;million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, while some Muslims attend the fair for trade.

The [[Tarnetar]] Fair is held during the first week of ''Bhadrapad'', (September–October according to [[Gregorian calendar]]), and mostly serves as a place to find a suitable bride for tribal people from Gujarat. The region is believed to be the place where [[Arjuna]] took up the difficult task of piercing the eye of a fish, rotating at the end of a pole, by looking at its reflection in the pond water, to marry [[Draupadi]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tarnetar Fair |url=http://www.gujaratindia.com/about-gujarat/tarnetar-mela.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018082543/http://gujaratindia.com/about-gujarat/tarnetar-mela.htm |archive-date=18 October 2011 |access-date=14 February 2012 |publisher=[[Government of Gujarat]]}}</ref>
