{{nihongo|'''Shimonoseki'''|下関市|Shimonoseki-shi|lead=yes}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2023|06|30}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of  248,193 in 128,762 households and a [[population density]] of 350 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Shimonoseki-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.shimonoseki.lg.jp/soshiki/134/1190.html|title= Shimonoseki City official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{convert|716.18|sqkm|sqmi}}. It is the largest city in Yamaguchi Prefecture and the fifth-largest city in the [[Chūgoku region]] in terms of population. It is nicknamed the "[[Fugu]] Capital" for the locally caught [[pufferfish]], and is the largest harvester of the pufferfish in Japan.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==History==
Shimonoseki is part of ancient [[Nagato Province]]. It has prospered since ancient times as the gateway to Honshu island from the Asian continent, including Kyushu, China, and the [[Korean peninsula]]. According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the semi-legendary [[Emperor Chuai]] constructed a palace at the location of what is now the Shimonoseki city hall during the [[Kofun period]]. The name of  "Shimonoseki" appears in [[Heian period]] documents from 869 AD as the location of a checkpoint controlling maritime access to the Seto Inland Sea; however, by the [[Kamakura period]], the name of "Akamanoseki" was in more common use. During the [[Genpei War]], the [[Heike clan|Heike]] and [[Genji clan|Genji]] fought at the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]] near the present [[Kanmonkyo Bridge|Kanmon Bridge]]. During the [[Muromachi period]], the powerful [[Ōuchi clan]] was ''[[shugo]]'' of both Nagato and [[Buzen Province]] in [[Kyushu]] and thus controlled trade and diplomatic missions from [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] and [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]]. In the [[Edo period]], the area was part of [[Chōfu Domain]] controlled by the [[Mōri clan]]. In February 1691, German explorer [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] visited the town as part of his two-year stay in Japan, and described it as having around 400 to 500 houses, and as a major port in the region for supplying ship provisions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kaempfer|first=Engelbert|title=Histoire naturelle, civile et ecclésiastique de l'Empire du Japon. Tome 2 (translated by François Naudé)|year=1729|location=[[The Hague]]|pages=176|language=fr}}</ref> During the [[Bakumatsu period]], the [[Shimonoseki campaign|Bombardment of Shimonoseki]] occurred in 1864, and in the early [[Meiji period]], the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was signed in 1895, seeing a defeated China hand over [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], and [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]] to the victorious Japanese at the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. An Imperial decree in July 1899 established Shimonoseki as an open port for trading with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>US Department of State. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKCOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA759&dq=  ''A digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties and other international agreements'' (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759].</ref>

Akamagaseki city was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. The city was renamed Shimonoseki on June 1, 1902.

On February 13, 2005, Shimonoseki absorbed the towns of [[Hōhoku, Yamaguchi|Hōhoku]], [[Kikugawa, Yamaguchi|Kikugawa]], [[Toyota, Yamaguchi|Toyota]] and [[Toyoura, Yamaguchi|Toyoura]] (all from [[Toyoura District, Yamaguchi|Toyoura District]]) to create the new and expanded city of Shimonseki. Since October 1, 2005, the city has been designated as a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] by the Japanese government with increased local autonomy.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Geography==
Shimonoseki is located at the westernmost point of Yamaguchi Prefecture and the westernmost point of [[Honshu]]. It borders the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west and the [[Seto Inland Sea]] to the south across the [[Kanmon Straits]]. It is long in the north-south direction and has a fan shape that opens to the Seto Inland Sea. The [[Asa River (Japan)|Asa River]] flows from the north to the central area, and the Ariho River flows from the northeast to the east, flowing southward into the Seto Inland Sea. The city hall is located on the west bank of the Ariho River mouth.
