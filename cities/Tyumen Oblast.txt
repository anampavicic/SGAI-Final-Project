Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The autonomous regions are concentrated the bulk of the country's oil and gas. The total volume of exploration drilling has exceeded 45 million meters. Oil production is concentrated in the Middle Ob. Gas is produced mainly in the northern areas. Large oil fields are located in the Khanty-Ugra: [[Samotlor Field]], Ob, [[Fyodorovskoye Field]], Mamontovskoye, Krasnoleninskoye; gas - in the Yamalo-Nenets District: [[Urengoy Field]], Bear, [[Yamburg Field]]. The depth from 700 m to 4&nbsp;km. Produced [[peat]], [[sapropel]], [[quartz sand]], [[limestone]]. Explored about 400 deposits of raw materials for the production of building materials [source not specified 252 days].

Ore minerals and precious stones discovered on the eastern slope of the Subpolar and [[Polar Urals|Polar]] [[Urals]] (in particular, the deposits of [[Lead]], [[copper]], [[chromite]]).

The area is rich in fresh water resources, which are represented by large rivers - the Ob, Irtysh, Tobol, lakes (650 ths.) - Black (224&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), Big Uvat (179&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), etc., groundwater, that contain more than half of Russian stocks. iodine (30 mlg / l) and bromine (40-50 mlg / l)

Over 44% of the land reserves in the south of the region are covered with forests. 43 million hectares are covered by forests. The forest resources area is the third largest in the Russian Federation after the Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Irkutsk Region. The main forest forming species are pine, birch, spruce, fir, aspen and larch. The total timber reserves are estimated at 5.4 billion cubic meters.

In the south of the Tyumen region are about ten hot (37-50&nbsp;°C) [[Geothermal activity|geothermal]] sources, having [[balneological]] properties. Sources are popular not only among residents of Tyumen, but in neighboring regions as well: the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Sverdlovsk]], [[Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], and [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]] regions.
