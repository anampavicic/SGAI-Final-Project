==Woodbridge Floodplain==
[[File:Flood Plain.jpg|thumb|Flood hazard zones in Woodbridge Township]]
Woodbridge's geographical features make it prone to repeated flooding. It is surrounded by water on three sides: the [[Arthur Kill]], a [[tidal strait]] to the east, and [[tidal river]]s to the south, [[Raritan River]], and north, [[Rahway River]]; and, much of the developed land in Woodbridge has low elevations, as little as five feet above sea level. About 19% of Woodbridge Township lies within [[FEMA]]'s [[Special Flood Hazard Area|flood hazard areas]].<ref name=:"S">{{Cite web |url=https://www.twp.woodbridge.nj.us/DocumentCenter/View/8040/Detailed-Descriptions-of-Woodbridge-Townships-Floodplains|title=Description of Woodbridge Township floodplains|website=www.twp.woodbridge.nj.us|access-date=January 28, 2020|archive-date=January 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115232900/https://www.twp.woodbridge.nj.us/DocumentCenter/View/8040/Detailed-Descriptions-of-Woodbridge-Townships-Floodplains|url-status=live}}</ref> There is a long history of [[tidal flooding]] along the  Woodbridge River in  Woodbridge Proper, the Raritan in Keasbey and the Arthur Kill in Sewaren and Port Reading.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/lps/SRPRs/Woodbridge_SRPR.pdf|title=Special flood Hazard zone|access-date=January 28, 2020|archive-date=January 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128211731/https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/lps/SRPRs/Woodbridge_SRPR.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to tidal flooding, [[fluvial]] flooding is common. Woodbridge streams and rivers have been described as having a "high flow, flashy nature." The land is relatively impervious, and flooding is exacerbated by steep slopes and urban cover. Flooding in the South Branch Rahway River and [[Pumpkin Patch Brook]] hazard zones is predominantly fluvial. Prolonged coastal storms ([[nor'easters]]), which combine tidal and fluvial flooding, along with flow constrictions, cause an increase in the duration of flooding of the [[Woodbridge River]] and its tributaries, [[Heards Brook]] and [[Wedgewood Brook]], which may last for days before water levels subside.<ref name=:"S"/> Frequency of flooding has increased over time. Sea levels are rising and residential areas have moved into previous marsh land, decreasing the ability of the land to absorb excess water. A 1770 map shows that all land surrounding the Woodbridge River was [[salt marshes]]. I
