'''Nekemte''', also spelled as '''Neqemte''' ({{Langx|om|Naqamtee}}, [[Amharic]]: ነቀምት), is a market city and separate [[Districts of Ethiopia|woreda]] in western [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[East Welega Zone]] of the [[Oromia Region]], Nekemte has a latitude and longitude of {{coord|9|5|N|36|33|E}} and an elevation of 2,088 meters.

Nekemte was the capital of the former [[East Welega Zone|East Welega]], and is home to a museum of [[Machaa]] Oromo culture. It is a burial place of [[Onesimos Nesib]], a famous Oromo who translated the Bible to Oromo Language for the first time, in collaboration with [[Aster Ganno]]. It is also the seat of an Apostolic Vicariate of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=NAI-web>[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/n/ORTNEJ.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 27 January 2008)</ref> Nekemte is host to [[Wollega University]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wuni.edu.et/ |title=Wollega university official website |access-date=2012-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213234215/http://www.wuni.edu.et/ |archive-date=2012-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is served by an [[Nekemte Airport|airport]] that is not currently open to commercial flights.

Nekemte is at the center of the road network for south-western Ethiopia. The first major road dates to the early 1930s, with a road that extended from the capital [[Addis Ababa]] west through [[Addis Alem, Shewa|Addis Alem]], although the road was passable only by lorries for the 255 kilometers between Addis Alem and Nekemte.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1968|p=293}} Pankhurst later notes in his book that this road had five toll-gates.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1968|p=522}} A road connecting Nekemte to [[Gimbi]], 110 kilometers in length, was part of the first stage of the Third Highway Program in 1963. Postal service for this city has been present as early as 1923. A branch of the [[Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority]] began providing electricity to the city by 1960. By 1957, phone service extended to the city.<ref name=NAI-web/>

== History ==
Nekemte like most of the towns of the [[Welega Province]] grew as a result of the rise of agricultural surplus after the Oromo became permanently settled in the early in the late 16th-century. Its rise was also closely connected with the rise of the Oromo institution of [[Gadaa]], a system where every 8 years leadership in the community was transferred to a new age class of leaders.<ref name=jstor41966012>{{cite journal |last1=Ta'a |first1=Tesema |title=The Process of Urbanization in Wollega, Western Ethiopia: the Case of Neqemte |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |date=1993 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=59–72 |jstor=41966012 }}</ref>

Nekemte was formerly overshadowed by nearby [[Lieka]] and [[Bilo, Ethiopia|Bilo]], the former regional markets. Nekemte acquired some importance when [[Bekere Godana]] in 1841 extended his rule of Nekemte over more area to form a new polity.<ref name=jstor41966012/> and later his son [[Moroda Bekere]] made it the capital of their kingdom of Welega in the mid-19th century. Under Mereda's son [[Kumsa Mereda|Kumsa Moroda]] (Gebregziabher Moroda after converting to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Christianity]]), the city continued in its importance as it submitted to [[Shewa]]n rule. The Russian explorer [[Alexander Bulatovich]] visited Nekemte 13 March 1897; in memoirs he describes its marketplace as "a very lively place and presents a motley mixture of languages, dress, and peoples", and carefully described the paintings in the city's newly constructed [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] church.<ref>[http://www.samizdat.com/entotto.html ''From Entotto to the River Baro''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216204959/http://www.samizdat.com/entotto.html |date=2017-12-16 }} (1897), translated by Richard Selzer, ''Ethiopia through Russian Eyes: Country in Transition, 1896-1898'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 2000) {{ISBN|1-56902-117-1}} (accessed 2 November 2009)</ref> In 1905, a central government customs office was officially opened in Nekemte. Construction on a hospital began in 1927, and was completed in 1932 with [[Ethiopia–Sweden relations|Swedish]] funds as well as contributions from ''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'' Tafari (who later became Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]]). It formally opened 16 February 1932, although it had already been in operation for eight months.<ref name=NAI-web/>

By 1935 Nekemte had become the most important town in [[Welega]]. There were nearly 70 foreign residents before the [[Italian East Africa|Italian occupation]], mostly merchants and missionaries. 23 importers-exporters had agencies there, most of whom were [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|Indians]], but these also included two [[Greeks in Ethiopia|Greeks]], a [[Lebanese diaspora|Lebanese]], and an [[Ethiopian Armenians|Armenian]].{{sfn|Pankhurst|1968|p=450}} The British explorer Dunlop, who spent four days of the same year in that city, noted that its central location on the main trade route between [[Addis Ababa]] and the Anglo-Sudan led to it having "developed enormously during the preceding few years, as the new school, warehouses, stores, and hospital testified".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dunlop |first1=A. |title=The Dadessa Valley |journal=The Geographical Journal |date=1937 |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=507–521 |doi=10.2307/1787909 |jstor=1787909 }}</ref>

During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion]], Nekemte was bombed by the Italians 5 July 1936; this included dropping 19 bombs on the recently constructed school complex of the local Swedish mission. ''[[Dejazmach]]'' Habte Maryam, governor of Welega, accepted the Italians and received Colonel A. Marone who arrived by air on 14 October and the troops of Colonel Malta who reached the city on 24 October, after having marched by foot and mule for twelve days from Addis Alem, which weakened ''Ras'' [[Imru Haile Selassie]]'s attempts as Prince Regent to establish a center of resistance at [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]]. After his successful return to Ethiopia, on 20 May 1941 Emperor Haile Selassie visited Welega where fighting still continued and where [[Kebede Tesemma]] was in charge of the ''[[Arbegnoch]]''. When he attempted to visit Nekemte, his party came under artillery fire.<ref name=NAI-web/>

A public address system was installed in the central square in Nekemte (and in ten other towns) in 1955, used for receiving transmission from Radio Addis Ababa and re-broadcasting it. In 1957 Haile Sellasie I School was opened, one of nine provincial secondary schools in Ethiopia and outside Eritrea. At that time Nekemte was still the end point of the telephone line westward. The Tafari Makonnen [[Leprosarium]] (founded that year) also had a home-school for children of leprous parents.<ref name=NAI-web/>

Head of State [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] visited Nekemte during a formal tour in March–May 1979. In that same year, over 300 Evangelical Christians had been imprisoned for political reasons.<ref name=NAI-web/>

Early in 1991, the Ethiopian [[Fourth Revolutionary Army]] had its headquarters at Nekemte. The [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] captured Nekemte on 2 April 1991, as part of Operation Freedom and Equality (''Duula Bilisummaa fi Walqixxummaa''). In response, the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF) said in a broadcast on the Radio Voice of Oromo Liberation (Frankfurt am Main) on 15 April 1991: "The OLF strongly opposes the phrase: liberating Wellega or the Oromo nation. It is false for any alien force to say that it will liberate the Oromo nation."<ref name=NAI-web/>

After the Ethiopian trade mission in the Somaliland city of [[Hargeisa]] was hit by a suicide bomb attack, which killed at least four Ethiopian civilian lives on 29 October 2008, three human rights activists working for the [[Ethiopian Human Rights Council]] in Nekemte were arrested, but were released by 27 November.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/11/26/ethiopia-charge-or-free-ethnic-oromo-terrorism-suspects "Ethiopia: Charge or Free Ethnic Oromo Terrorism Suspects"], [[Human Rights Watch]] website, 27 November 2009 (accessed 17 March 2009)</ref>

== Climate ==
The city has a mild [[Oceanic climate|highland subtropical climate]] (Köppen: ''Cwb''). With a lower elevation than [[Addis Ababa]], Nekemte has a slightly higher average temperature, differing mainly in the low averages. The average annual temperature is 18.3&nbsp;°C (high: 24&nbsp;°C and low: 12.6&nbsp;°C), although to the north of [[Equator]] March is the warmest month and July the coldest month. With more than 2080&nbsp;mm, it is one of the rainiest places in the country, with most of that rain occurring in the Summer. Nekemte is on an imaginary line where western winds give way to eastern ones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/africa/etiopia/oromia/nekemte-3653/|title=Nekemte climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Nekemte weather averages - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-8026-1_3 |chapter=The Climate of Ethiopia |title=Landscapes and Landforms of Ethiopia |series=World Geomorphological Landscapes |year=2015 |last1=Fazzini |first1=Massimiliano |last2=Bisci |first2=Carlo |last3=Billi |first3=Paolo |pages=65–87 |isbn=978-94-017-8025-4 }}</ref> It is one of the seven rainiest cities in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcdmp/documents/Ethiopia.pdf|title=Climate Data observation, climate monitoring and long range forecast methods in Ethiopia|last=Lemma|first=Melesse|date=2013-04-15|publisher=National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia|access-date=2019-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503090235/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcdmp/documents/Ethiopia.pdf |archive-date=3 May 2017}}</ref> From about 2007 to 2017, a nearby [[Weather station|meteorological station]] showed an average annual temperature that, though lower than that from 1990, was still higher than 1970, when rigorous recordkeeping began there, as well as greater precipitation than that seen in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Abebe |first1=Gezahegn |title=Long-term climate data description in Ethiopia |journal=Data in Brief |date=October 2017 |volume=14 |pages=371–392 |doi=10.1016/j.dib.2017.07.052 |pmid=28831403 |pmc=5552378 }}</ref>
