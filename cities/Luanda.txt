'''Luanda''' (/luˈændə, -ˈɑːn-/, Portuguese: [luˈɐ̃dɐ]) is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities and towns in Angola|largest city]] of [[Angola]]. It is Angola's primary [[port]], and its major industrial, cultural and urban centre. Located on Angola's northern Atlantic coast, Luanda is Angola's [[administrative centre]], its chief seaport, and also the capital of the [[Luanda Province]]. Luanda and its [[metropolitan area]] is the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city in the world and the most populous [[Lusophone]] city outside [[Brazil]]. In 2020 the population reached more than 8.3 million inhabitants (a third of Angola's population).

Among the oldest colonial cities of Africa, Luanda was founded in January 1576 as ''São Paulo da Assunção de Loanda'' by Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]], being occasionally called "Leonda" or "St Paul de Leonda" by non-portuguese sources. The city served as the centre of the [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]] to Brazil before the institution was prohibited. 

At the start of the [[Angolan Civil War]] in 1975, most of the white Portuguese left as refugees,<ref name=":0" /> principally migrating to Portugal. Luanda's population increased greatly from internal refugees fleeing the war, but its infrastructure was inadequate to handle the increase. This also caused the exacerbation of slums, or [[musseques]], around Luanda. 

In the 21st century, the city has been undergoing a major reconstruction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.angola-today.com/tourism/destinations/luanda/|title=Luanda - Angola Today|work=Angola Today|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420082038/http://www.angola-today.com/tourism/destinations/luanda/|archive-date=2017-04-20|url-status=dead|language=en-US}}</ref> Many new large developments are taking place that will alter its cityscape significantly.

Industries present in the city include the processing of agricultural products, beverage production, textile, cement, new car assembly plants, construction materials, plastics, metallurgy, cigarettes and shoes. The city is also notable as an economic centre for oil,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jan/22/after-the-oil-boom-luanda-faces-stark-inequality-photo-essay|title=After the oil boom: Luanda faces stark inequality – photo essay|author=Guardian Staff|date=2019-01-22|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190615045024/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jan/22/after-the-oil-boom-luanda-faces-stark-inequality-photo-essay|archive-date=2019-06-15|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/extreme-city-specter|title=Luxury Living in a Failed State|last=Specter|first=Michael|magazine=The New Yorker |date=2015-05-25|access-date=2019-06-15|language=en|issn=0028-792X|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109003719/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/extreme-city-specter|archive-date=2019-01-09|url-status=live}}</ref> and a refinery is located in the city.

In recent decades of the 21st century, the number of ethnic [[Bakongo]] and [[Ovimbundu]] have also increased. Ethnic Europeans are mainly Portuguese. 

Luanda was the main host city for the matches of the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|2010 African Cup of Nations]].

In 1618, the Portuguese built the fortress called ''Fortaleza São Pedro da Barra'', and they subsequently built two more: [[Fortaleza de São Miguel]] (1634) and [[Fortress of Sao Francisco do Penedo|Forte de São Francisco do Penedo]] (1765–66).

Luanda was Portugal's bridgehead from 1627, except during the [[Dutch Loango-Angola|Dutch rule of Luanda]], from 1640 to 1648, as Fort Aardenburgh. The city served as the centre of [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]] to [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] from {{circa|1550}} to 1836.<ref>See Joseph Miller, ''Way of Death: Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade'', London & Madison/Wis, : James Currey & University of Wisconsin Press, 1988</ref> The slave trade was conducted mostly with the Portuguese colony of Brazil; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the port of Luanda.

In the 17th century, the [[Imbangala]] became the main rivals of the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] in supplying slaves to the Luanda market. In the 1751, between 5,000 and 10,000 slaves were annually sold.<ref name=a>{{cite book|last=Njoku|first=Onwuka N.|year=1997|title=Mbundu|url=https://archive.org/details/mbundu00njok|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mbundu00njok/page/38 38–39]|publisher=Rosen Pub. |isbn=9780823920044 }}</ref> By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong degree of Brazilian influence was noted in Luanda until the [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822.

In the 19th century, still under Portuguese rule, Luanda experienced a major economic revolution. The [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] was abolished in 1836, and in 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Continental Portugal]], full of trading companies, exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) [[palm oil|palm]] and [[peanut oil]], wax, [[copal]], timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], among many other products. Maize, tobacco, [[jerky|dried meat]], and [[cassava|cassava flour]] are also produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born by this time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Angola Embassy in Cairo|url=https://www.angolaeg.net/|website=www.angolaeg.net|access-date=2020-05-28|archive-date=2021-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604225442/https://www.angolaeg.net/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1889, Governor [[Hermenegildo Capelo|Brito Capelo]] opened the gates of an aqueduct which supplied the city with water, a formerly scarce resource, laying the foundation for major growth.

By the time of [[Angolan War of Independence|Angolan independence]] in 1975, Luanda was a modern city with the majority of its population being African, but also dominated by a strong minority of white Portuguese origin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

After the [[Carnation Revolution]] in Lisbon on April 25, 1974, with the advent of independence and the start of the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), most of the white Portuguese Luandans left as refugees,<ref name=":0">[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723131954/http://www.economist.com/node/12079340?story_id=12079340 |date=2013-07-23 }}, [[The Economist]] (August 16, 1975).</ref> principally for Portugal, however many travelled over land to [[South Africa]].
[[File:Porto de Luanda - Angola 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Luanda is experiencing widespread urban renewal and redevelopment in the 21st century, backed largely by profits from oil and diamond industries.]]
The large numbers of skilled technicians among the force of [[Cuba]]n soldiers sent in to support the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) government in the Angolan Civil War were able to make a valuable contribution to restoring and maintaining basic services in the city.

In the following years, however, slums called ''[[musseques]]''—which had existed for decades—began to grow out of proportion and stretched several kilometres beyond Luanda's former city limits as a result of the decades-long civil war, and because of the rise of deep social inequalities due to large-scale migration of civil war refugees from other Angolan regions. For decades, Luanda's facilities were not adequately expanded to handle this huge increase in the city's population.

The central government supposedly allocates funds to all regions of the country, but the capital region receives the bulk of these funds. Since the end of the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1971–2002), stability has been widespread in the country, and major reconstruction has been going on since 2002 in those parts of the country that were damaged during the civil war.

Luanda has been of major concern because its population had multiplied and had far outgrown the capacity of the city, especially because much of its infrastructure (water, electricity, roads etc.) had become obsolete and degraded.

===Human geography===
Luanda is divided into two parts, the ''Baixa de Luanda'' (lower Luanda, the old city) and the ''Cidade Alta'' (upper city or the new part). The ''Baixa de Luanda'' is situated next to the port, and has narrow streets and old colonial buildings.<ref>[http://www.gpl.gv.ao/Revista/VIAS%20DE%20LUANDA%20-%20Relat%C3%B3rio%20de%20Actividades%20n%C2%BA29%20-%20NOVEMBRO%20e%20DEZEom MBRO%20de%202010.pdf Streets of Luanda from the Luanda Provincial Government website]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} new pictures from Luanda City (Portuguese)</ref> However, new constructions have by now covered large areas beyond these traditional limits, and a number of previously independent nuclei&nbsp;— like Viana&nbsp;— were incorporated into the city.

===Metropolitan Luanda===
Until 2011, the former Luanda Province comprised what now forms five [[List of municipalities of Angola|municipalities]]. In 2011 the Province was enlarged by the addition of two additional municipalities transferred from [[Bengo Province]], namely Icolo e Bengo, and Quiçama. Excluding these additions, the five municipalities comprise Greater Luanda:

Two new municipalities have been created within Greater Luanda since 2017: [[Talatona]] and [[Kilamba-Kiaxi]]

====Districts====
[[File:Miradouro da Lua (Angola).jpg|thumb|left|Miradouro da Lua in Samba district]]
The city of Luanda is divided in six urban districts: [[Ingombota]], Angola Quiluanje, Maianga, Rangel, Samba and Sambizanga.

In Samba and Sambizanga, more high-rise developments are to be built. The capital Luanda is growing constantly - and in addition, increasingly beyond the official city limits and even provincial boundaries.

Luanda is the seat of a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] archbishop. It is also the location of most of Angola's educational institutions, including the private [[Catholic University of Angola]] and the public [[University of Agostinho Neto]]. It is also the home of the colonial Governor's Palace and the [[Estádio da Cidadela]] (the "Citadel Stadium"), Angola's main stadium, with a total seating capacity of 60,000.<ref name="zerozero">{{cite web |url=http://www.zerozero.pt/estadio.php?id=1064 |title=Estádio da Cidadela |publisher=zerozero.pt |access-date=2016-02-07 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504213205/http://www.zerozero.pt/estadio.php?id=1064 |archive-date=2014-05-04 }}</ref>

===Climate===
Luanda has a [[hot semi-arid climate|hot semi-desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh''), bordering upon a [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot desert climate]] (''BWh''). The climate is warm to hot but surprisingly dry, owing to the cool [[Benguela Current]], which prevents moisture from easily condensing into rain. Frequent fog prevents temperatures from falling at night even during the completely dry months from May to October. Luanda has an annual rainfall of {{convert|405|mm|in|1}}, but the variability is among the highest in the world, with a co-efficient of variation above 40 percent.<ref>Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; "Geographical patterning in interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach"; in ''Journal of Climate'', 12; pp. 3457–3466</ref> The climate is largely influenced by the offshore Benguela current. The current gives the city a surprisingly low humidity despite its tropical latitude, which makes the hotter months considerably more bearable than similar cities in Western/Central Africa.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Visit Luanda, Angola |url=https://visitafrica.site/cities/experience-luanda/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210421003943/https://visitafrica.site/luanda.html |archive-date=2021-04-21 |access-date=2021-02-13 |website=visitafrica.site |language=en-GB}}</ref> Observed records since 1858 range from {{convert|55|mm|in}} in 1958 to {{convert|851|mm|in}} in 1916. The short rainy season in March and April depends on a northerly counter current bringing moisture to the city: it has been shown clearly that weakness in the Benguela Current can increase rainfall about sixfold compared with years when that current is strong.<ref>[http://traveltoafrica.info/chuva-em-luanda-angola.html Video from heavy rain falls in Luanda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727171345/http://traveltoafrica.info/chuva-em-luanda-angola.html |date=2012-07-27 }} December 28, 2010</ref>

==== Climate change ====
A 2019 paper published in [[PLOS One]] estimated that under [[Representative Concentration Pathway#4.5|Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5]], a "moderate" scenario of [[climate change]] where global warming reaches ~{{convert|2.5-3|C-change|F-change}} by 2100, the climate of Luanda in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of [[Guatemala City]]. The annual temperature would increase by {{convert|0.7|C-change|F-change}}, the temperature of the coldest month by {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change}}, and the temperature of the warmest month by {{convert|0.1|C-change|F-change}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bastin |first1=Jean-Francois |last2=Clark |first2=Emily |last3=Elliott |first3=Thomas |last4=Hart |first4=Simon |last5=van den Hoogen |first5=Johan |last6=Hordijk |first6=Iris |last7=Ma |first7=Haozhi |last8=Majumder |first8=Sabiha |last9=Manoli |first9=Gabriele |last10=Maschler |first10=Julia |last11=Mo |first11=Lidong |last12=Routh |first12=Devin |last13=Yu |first13=Kailiang |last14=Zohner |first14=Constantin M. |last15=Thomas W. |first15=Crowther |title=Understanding climate change from a global analysis of city analogues |journal=PLOS ONE |date=10 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |at=S2 Table.

Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Luanda is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], Luanda and [[Maputo]]) which would be the most severely affected by the future [[sea level rise]]. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of USD 65 billion under RCP 4.5 and USD 86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to 137.5 billion USD in damages, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to USD 187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, USD 206 billion for RCP8.5 and USD 397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.<ref>Trisos, C.H., I.O.

The inhabitants of Luanda are primarily members of African ethnic groups, mainly [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], [[Ovimbundu]], and [[Bakongo]]. The official and the most widely used language is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], although several [[Bantu languages]] are also used, chiefly [[Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu]], and [[Kikongo]].<ref name=":1" />

The population of Luanda has grown dramatically in recent years, due in large part to war-time migration to the city, which is safe compared to the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-adv/specialsales/spotlight/angola/article8.html |title=International Spotlight: Angola |work=Washingtonpost.com |access-date=2011-04-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106155002/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-adv/specialsales/spotlight/angola/article8.html |archive-date=2012-11-06 }}</ref> In 2006, however, Luanda saw an increase in violent crime, particularly in the shanty towns that surround the colonial urban core.<ref>{{cite news |title=Angola: Easy access to guns concern as election nears - Angola {{!}} ReliefWeb |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/angola/angola-easy-access-guns-concern-election-nears |access-date=26 September 2023 |work=reliefweb.int |agency=The New Humanitarian |date=13 March 2006 |language=en}}</ref>

There is a sizable minority population of [[Europe]]an origin, especially [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] (about 260,000), as well as [[Brazilian people|Brazilians]].

Living conditions in Luanda are poor for most of the people, with essential services such as safe drinking water and electricity still in short supply, and severe shortcomings in traffic conditions.<ref>[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/Case-Studies/2009/Keeping-the-flow-in-Angolas-slums/ Keeping the flow in Angola's slums] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715122124/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/Case-Studies/2009/Keeping-the-flow-in-Angolas-slums/ |date=2009-07-15 }}, [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), United Kingdom (February 13, 2009)</ref>

Luanda is one of the world's [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees|most expensive]] cities for resident foreigners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mercer.com/newsroom/cost-of-living-survey.html |title=Worldwide Cost of Living survey 2015 - City rankings |publisher=www.mercer.com |access-date=2015-06-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619201330/http://www.mercer.com/newsroom/cost-of-living-survey.html |archive-date=2015-06-19 }}</ref> In Mercer’s cost of living index, Luanda was ranked as top of the list due to the extremely high costs of goods and security. Luanda sits above [[Seoul]], [[Geneva]] and [[Shanghai]] in the rankings. These costs have fueled rampant inequality in the city. Skyscrapers are left barren as the price of oil drops.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mayda |first=Matteo de |date=2017-07-07 |title=Divided Luanda: life inside a city fueled by inequality – in pictures |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2017/jul/07/luanda-angola-expensive-city-divided-oil-in-pictures |access-date=2022-09-26 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

New import tariffs imposed in March 2014 made Luanda even more expensive. As an example, a half-litre tub of vanilla ice cream at the supermarket was reported to cost US$31. The higher import tariffs applied to hundreds of items, from garlic to cars. The stated aim was to try to diversify the heavily oil-dependent economy and nurture farming and industry, sectors that have remained weak. These tariffs have caused much hardship in a country where the average salary was US$260 per month in 2010, the latest year for which data was available. However, the average salary in the booming oil industry was over 20 times higher at US$5,400 per month.<ref name="www.independent.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/angolas-new-import-tariffs-putting-the-squeeze-on-the-poorest-residents-in-one-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-cities-9278530.html|title=Angola's new import tariffs putting the squeeze on the poorest residents in one of the world's most expensive cities|newspaper=The Independent|date=2014-04-23|access-date=2014-05-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427052726/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/angolas-new-import-tariffs-putting-the-squeeze-on-the-poorest-residents-in-one-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-cities-9278530.html|archive-date=2014-04-27}}</ref>

Manufacturing includes [[convenience food|processed foods]], [[drink|beverages]], [[textile]]s, [[cement]] and other building materials, [[plastic]] products, metalware, [[cigarette]]s, and shoes/clothes. [[Petroleum]] (found in nearby off-shore deposits) is refined in the city, although this facility was repeatedly damaged during the [[Angolan Civil War]] of 1975–2002. Luanda has an excellent natural harbour; the chief exports are [[coffee]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[diamond]]s, [[iron]], and [[salt]].{{cn|date=October 2022}}

The city also has a thriving building industry, an effect of the nationwide economic boom experienced since 2002, when political stability returned with the end of the civil war. Economic growth is largely supported by [[oil extraction]] activities, although great [[economic diversification|diversification]] is taking place. Large [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] (domestic and international), along with strong economic growth, has dramatically increased construction of all economic sectors in the city of Luanda.<ref name="economist.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10316212 |title=GDP growth: A look ahead |magazine=The Economist |date=2007-12-19 |access-date=2010-06-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125213302/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10316212 |archive-date=2010-01-25 }}</ref> In 2007, the first modern shopping mall in Angola was established in the city at [[Belas Shopping]] mall.<ref name="angonot">{{cite web|url=http://www.angonoticias.com/Artigos/item/12911|title=Belas shopping inaugurado em Luanda|publisher=Angonoticias.com|date=28 March 2007|access-date=2015-05-26|language=pt|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002246/http://www.angonoticias.com/Artigos/item/12911|archive-date=27 May 2015}}</ref>

===Railway===
Luanda is the starting point of the [[Luanda railway]] that goes due east to Malanje. The [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] left the railway non-functional, but the railway has been restored up to [[Dondo, Angola|Dondo]] and [[Malanje]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinainternationalfund.com/projects1.asp?Id=284 |title=China International Fund Limited |publisher=Chinainternationalfund.com |access-date=2010-06-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618030958/http://www.chinainternationalfund.com/projects1.asp?Id=284 |archive-date=2009-06-18 }}</ref>

===Airport===
[[File:Aeroport-4-de-Fevereiro-Chegadas LWS1962.JPG|thumb|right|[[Quatro de Fevereiro Airport]], Luanda]]
The main airport of Luanda is [[Quatro de Fevereiro Airport]], which is the largest in the country.

===Road transport===
Luanda's roads are in a poor state of repair, but are undergoing an extensive reconstruction process by the government in order to relieve [[traffic]] congestion in the city. Major road repairs can be found taking place in nearly every neighbourhood, including a major 6-lane [[highway]] connected Luanda to [[Viana, Angola|Viana]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200808180008.html |title=Angola: Part of Luanda's Highway Complete By December |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2008-08-15 |access-date=2010-06-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004173236/http://allafrica.com/stories/200808180008.html |archive-date=2009-10-04 }}</ref>

===Public transport===
Public transit is provided by the suburban services of the [[Luanda Railway]], by the public company [[Transporte Colectivo Urbano de Luanda|TCUL]], and by a large fleet of privately owned collective taxis as white-blue painted minibuses called ''Candongueiro''. Candongueiros are usually [[Toyota Hiace]] vans, that are built to carry 12 people, although the candongueiros usually carry at least 15 people. They charge from 100 to 200 kwanzas per trip. They are known to disobey traffic rules, for example not stopping at signs and driving over pavements and aisles.

In 2019, the [[Luanda Light Rail]] network with an estimated cost of [[U.S. dollar|US $]]3 billion was announced to begin construction in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://macauhub.com.mo/en/2019/11/06/pt-metro-de-superficie-de-luanda-vai-custar-3000-milhoes-de-dolares/|title=Luanda surface light rail system will cost US$3 billion – Macauhub|website=Macauhub|date=6 November 2019|access-date=6 November 2019}}{{Dead link|date=November 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
