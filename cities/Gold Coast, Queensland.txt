The area that became the Gold Coast was originally inhabited by the indigenous [[Yugambeh people]]. The city grew from a collection of small townships, the earliest being [[Nerang, Queensland|Nerang]] in 1865. From the 1920s onwards, tourism led to significant economic growth in the region, and by 1959 the Gold Coast was declared a city, with its [[Kinkabool|first skyscraper]] being built in 1960. The Gold Coast boomed from the 1980s onwards with [[List of tallest buildings on the Gold Coast|skyscraper construction]].

Europeans arrived in 1823 when explorer John Oxley landed at Mermaid Beach. The hinterland's [[Toona ciliata|red cedar]] supply attracted people to the area in the mid-19th century.

A number of small townships developed along the coast and in the hinterland. The western suburb of [[Nerang]] was surveyed and established as a base for the industry and by 1870 a town reserve had been set aside.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27261085 |title=Government Notifications|newspaper=The Queenslander |volume=V |issue=225 |date=28 May 1870 |access-date=9 May 2016 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> By 1873, the town reserve of [[Burleigh Heads]] had also been surveyed and successful land sales had taken place.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27277719 |title=Country News, by Mail |newspaper=The Queenslander |volume=VIII |issue=398 |date=20 September 1873 |access-date=9 May 2016 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=24 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924030128/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/27277719 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1875, the small settlement opposite the boat passage at the head of the [[Nerang River]], known as Nerang Heads or Nerang Creek Heads, was surveyed and renamed [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]], with the first land sales scheduled to take place in Beenleigh.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27507681 |title=Sixty Years Ago|newspaper=The Queenslander |date=2 May 1935 |access-date=9 May 2016 |page=51 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] quickly grew a reputation as a secluded holiday destination for wealthy [[Brisbane]] residents.

Post-World War One Era saw the rise of the "seaside shack". The seaside shack provided the opportunity for the coastal "getaway" with modest investment.  From 1914 to 1946, they popped up all along the South Coast. Seaside shacks were exceedingly cheap and were an early use of the concept of recycling.

The Gold Coast is approximately half covered by forests of various types. This includes small patches of near-pristine ancient rainforest, mangrove-covered islands, and patches of coastal heathlands and farmland with areas of uncleared eucalyptus forest. Of the plantation pine forests that were planted in the 1950s and 1960s, when commercial forest planting for tax minimisation was encouraged by the Commonwealth government, tiny remnants remain.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gold Coast Transformed |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/20/pid/7365.htm |editor1=Hundloe, Tor |editor2=McDougall, Bridgette |editor3=Page, Craig |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |year=2015 |isbn=9781486303298 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904063650/http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/20/pid/7365.htm |archive-date=4 September 2015  |access-date=24 March 2015 }}</ref> Most of the Gold Coast area was covered by forest prior to European human settlement and extensive land clearing in the 19th century.

Gold Coast City lies in the southeast corner of [[Queensland]], to the south of [[Brisbane]], the state capital. The [[Albert River, Queensland|Albert River]] separates the Gold Coast from [[Logan City, Queensland|Logan City]], a local government area south of the [[City of Brisbane]].

Gold Coast City stretches from the Albert River, [[Logan River]], and [[Southern Moreton Bay Islands (Redland City)|Southern Moreton Bay]] to the border with [[New South Wales]] (NSW) approximately {{convert|56|km|mi|abbr=on}} south, and extends from the coast west to the foothills of the [[Great Dividing Range]] in [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] listed [[Lamington National Park]].

The southernmost town of Gold Coast City, [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]], includes [[Point Danger (Tweed Heads)|Point Danger]] and its [[lighthouse]]. Coolangatta is a twin city with [[Tweed Heads]] located directly across the NSW border. At {{Coord|28.1667|S|153.55|E|region:AU-QLD}}, this is the most easterly point on the Queensland mainland (Point Lookout on the offshore island of [[North Stradbroke Island|North Stradbroke]] is slightly further east). From Coolangatta, approximately forty kilometres of holiday resorts and surfing beaches stretch north to the suburb of Main Beach, and then further on Stradbroke Island. The suburbs of [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] and [[Surfers Paradise]] form the Gold Coast's commercial centre. The major river in the area is the [[Nerang River]]. Much of the land between the coastal strip and the hinterland were once [[wetlands]] drained by this river, but the swamps have been converted into man-made waterways (over {{convert|260|km|mi}} in length<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/boating-969.html |title=Boating |publisher=Gold Coast City Council |date=17 June 2010 |access-date=27 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310212342/http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/boating-969.html |archive-date=10 March 2013  }}</ref> or over 9 times the length of the canals of [[Venice]], Italy) and artificial islands covered in upmarket homes. The heavily developed coastal strip sits on a narrow barrier [[sandbar]] between these waterways and the sea.

To the west, the city borders a part of the [[Great Dividing Range]] commonly referred to as the [[Gold Coast hinterland]]. A {{convert|206|km2|abbr=on}} section of the mountain range is protected by [[Lamington National Park]] and has been listed as a [[World Heritage]] area in recognition of its "outstanding geological features displayed around shield volcanic craters and the high number of rare and threatened rainforest species".<ref name="UNESCO">{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/368|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre, Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510114048/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/368/ |archive-date=10 May 2015 }}</ref> The area attracts [[bushwalking|bushwalkers]] and day-trippers.

=== Urban structure ===
{{Main|List of Gold Coast suburbs}}
The City of Gold Coast includes suburbs, localities, towns and [[rural district]]s.

The declaration of Southport as a Priority Development Area (PDA) and new investment into the CBD is driving transformative change and creating new business and investment opportunities.
[[File:Surfers from 76 Stories-11+ (150849045).jpg|thumb|Suburban canals, as viewed from the [[Q1 (building)|Q1]]]]

===Waterways===
Waterfront canal living is a feature of the Gold Coast. Most canal frontage homes have pontoons. The [[Gold Coast Seaway]], between [[Southport Spit, Queensland|The Spit]] and [[South Stradbroke Island]], allows vessels direct access to the Pacific Ocean from [[Gold Coast Broadwater|The Broadwater]] and many of the city's canal estates. Breakwaters on either side of the Seaway prevent [[longshore drift]] and the bar from silting up. A sand pumping operation on the Spit pipes sand under the Seaway to continue this natural process.

Residential canals were first built in the Gold Coast in the 1950s and construction continues. Most canals are extensions to the Nerang River, but there are more to the south along [[Tallebudgera Creek]] and [[Currumbin Creek]] and to the north along the [[Gold Coast Broadwater]], [[South Stradbroke Island]], [[Coomera River]] and southern Moreton Bay. Early canals included Florida Gardens and [[Isle of Capri, Queensland|Isle of Capri]] which were under construction at the time of a 1954 flood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/emergency/2014-02-18/unnamed-great-gold-coast-cyclone-february-1954/5266720|title=The Great Gold Coast Cyclone – February 1954|author=Damien Larkins|date=20 February 2014|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=25 February 2019|archive-date=24 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224045341/https://www.abc.net.au/news/emergency/2014-02-18/unnamed-great-gold-coast-cyclone-february-1954/5266720|url-status=live}}</ref> Recently constructed canals include Harbour Quays and Riverlinks completed in 2007.

===Beaches===
[[File:Surfers arch.JPG|thumb|The entrance to [[Surfers Paradise]] beach|left]]
The city consists of {{convert|70|km|mi}} of coastline, with some of the most popular [[Surfing|surf]] breaks in Australia and the world, including [[South Stradbroke Island]], [[Southport Spit, Queensland|The Spit]], [[Main Beach, Queensland|Main Beach]], [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]], [[Broadbeach, Queensland|Broadbeach]], Mermaid Beach, Nobby's Beach, [[Miami, Queensland|Miami]], North Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Beach, [[Burleigh Heads, Queensland|Burleigh Heads]], Tallebudgera Beach, [[Palm Beach, Queensland|Palm Beach]], South Palm Beach, Currumbin Beach, Tugun, [[Bilinga, Queensland|Bilinga]], North Kirra Beach [[Kirra, Queensland|Kirra]], [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]], [[Greenmount Beach|Greenmount]], Rainbow Bay, [[Snapper Rocks]] and Froggies Beach. There is almost 42&nbsp;km of unbroken beachfront. [[Duranbah Beach]] is one of the world's best known [[surfing]] beaches and is often thought of as being part of Gold Coast City, but is actually just across the [[New South Wales]] state border in the [[Tweed Shire]].

There are also beaches along many of the Gold Coast's {{convert|860|km|mi|abbr=on}} of navigable tidal waterways. Popular inland beaches include [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]], Budds Beach, Marine Stadium, [[Currumbin Alley]], Tallebudgera Estuary, Jacobs Well, Jabiru Island, Paradise Point, Harley Park Labrador, Santa Barbara, Boykambil and Evandale Lake.[[File:Gold Coast summer, Burleigh Heads Beach.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burleigh Heads]] beach with Surfers Paradise skyline visible on the horizon]]'''Beach safety and management'''

==Government==
{{Main|City of Gold Coast|Government of Queensland}}

Administratively, the Gold Coast is a local government area called the [[City of Gold Coast]]. The City of Gold Coast Council has 14 elected councillors, each representing a division of the city. Businessman Tom Tate is the current [[Mayor of the Gold Coast]], first elected in 2012. Former mayors include [[Ron Clarke|Ron Clake]], Gary Baildon, [[Lex Bell]], [[Ray Stevens (politician)|Ray Stevens]], Ern Harley and [[Bruce Small|Sir Bruce Small]], who was responsible for the development of many of the canal estates that are now home to thousands of Gold Coast residents.

At the state level, the Gold Coast area is represented by eleven members in the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]]. The seats they hold are: [[Electoral district of Bonney|Bonney]], [[Electoral district of Broadwater|Broadwater]], [[Electoral district of Burleigh|Burleigh]], [[Electoral district of Coomera|Coomera]], [[Electoral district of Currumbin|Currumbin]], [[Electoral district of Gaven|Gaven]], [[Electoral district of Mermaid Beach|Mermaid Beach]], [[Electoral district of Mudgeeraba|Mudgeeraba]], [[Electoral district of Southport|Southport]], [[Electoral district of Surfers Paradise|Surfers Paradise]] and [[Electoral district of Theodore|Theodore]]. Federally, the Gold Coast area is split between five divisions in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]: [[Division of Fadden|Fadden]] (northern), [[Division of Moncrieff|Moncrieff]] (central) and [[Division of McPherson|McPherson]] (southern) are located entirely within the Gold Coast, while [[Division of Forde|Forde]] (north-west) and [[Division of Wright|Wright]] (south-west) encompass parts of the Gold Coast and other areas of Southeast Queensland.
[[File:Southport Courthouse.jpg|thumb|[[Southport Courthouse]]]]
Politically, the Gold Coast has often tilted conservative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2015/02/02/4172349.htm|title=Queensland election 2015: LNP retains hold on Gold Coast|work=ABC News|access-date=2 February 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205190923/http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2015/02/02/4172349.htm|archive-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> It was a [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] bastion for most of the first three decades after World War II, but increasing urbanisation has made it a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] stronghold. [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] has historically only done well around Labrador and Coolangatta. Only one Labor MP has ever represented a significant portion of the Gold Coast at the federal level since 1949; the three Gold Coast divisions have only returned Liberals since 1984. At the state level, Labor was fairly competitive in the Gold Coast for most of the early part of the 21st century. However, as part of its massive landslide in the [[2012 Queensland state election|2012 state election]], the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] won every seat there. The LNP repeated its sweep of the Gold Coast seats at the [[2015 Queensland state election|2015 election]], and retained all but one Gold Coast seat at the [[2017 Queensland state election|2017 state election]].

[[Southport Courthouse]] is the city's major courthouse and has jurisdiction to hear petty criminal offences and civil matters up to A$250,000. Indictable offences, criminal sentencing and civil matters above A$250,000 are heard in the higher [[Supreme Court of Queensland]] which is located in Brisbane. There is also a subsidiary Magistrates Court, located at the southern suburb of [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]].

In 2013 a brawl between members of [[Outlaw motorcycle gangs in Australia|Outlaw motorcycle gangs]] also called "bikies" who fought each other outside a [[Broadbeach]] restaurant caused mass fear to restaurant patrons and police.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-05/broadbeach-bikie-brawl-restaurant-patrons-started-screaming/6444926|title=Restaurant patrons started screaming, running away when brawl started, court told|last=Stevenson|first=Ashleigh|date=5 May 2015|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-08-04|archive-date=18 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818061703/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-05/broadbeach-bikie-brawl-restaurant-patrons-started-screaming/6444926|url-status=live}}</ref> This led to the toughest anti-bikie laws introduced in Australia known as [[Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act 2013]].

Another famous tourist attraction are the [[Surfers Paradise Meter Maids]], instituted in 1965 to put a positive spin on new parking regulations. To avoid tickets being issued for expired parking, the Meter Maids dispense coins into the meter and leave a calling card under the windscreen wiper of the vehicle. The Maids are still a part of the Surfers Paradise culture but the scheme is now run by private enterprise.

Despite rapid socio-economic changes and a tourist-centred image, there is evidence of local resident-driven culture (such as [[Surf culture#Surf gangs|surf gangs]]) in geographical pockets and a broader 'Gold Coaster' identity drawn from [[Globalization#Cultural globalization|globalised]] resort and real estate marketing material.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=S.|last2=Bennett|first2=A.|last3=Wise|first3=P.|title='Living 'the Strip': negotiating neighbourhood, community and identities on Australia's Gold Coast'|journal=Habitus of the Hood.|date=2012|page=96}}</ref> The Gold Coast hosts cultural activities that attract tourists and residents alike.

[[Burleigh Bears]] [[rugby league]] football club play in the [[Queensland Cup]] and have won four premierships (in 1999, 2004, 2016 and 2019).

Recreational activities on the Gold Coast include surfing, fishing, cycling, boating and golf. The Gold Coast area has numerous [[golf links]], including [[Hope Island, Queensland|Hope Island]], [[Sanctuary Cove]] and The Glades.

Sporting facilities include the [[Carrara Stadium]], Carrara Indoor Sport Centre, [[Nerang Velodrome]] and the Sports Super Centre. Some of these facilities are being superseded by newer and larger capacity facilities. Two examples of these are the [[Gold Coast Convention & Exhibition Centre]] to play host to a Gold Coast Basketball team and [[Robina Stadium]] to host [[National Rugby League|NRL]] games.

Former [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] performer [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] comes from the Gold Coast, as do Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer [[Grant Hackett]], [[2011 US Open (tennis)|2011 US Open]] tennis champion [[Samantha Stosur]] and [[Sally Pearson]] (who received the keys to the city).

The Gold Coast has garnered a reputation as a "sporting graveyard", as many of the professional clubs that have represented the Gold Coast in national leagues since the 1980s experience generally poor on-field performances, consistently struggle to support themselves financially, and have generally folded within a decade of being founded; as of 2019 no Gold Coast-based team has won a premiership in a national professional club competition.<ref>[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/united-joins-gold-coast-sporting-graveyard-20120404-1wckb.html United joins Gold Coast sporting graveyard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105225633/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/united-joins-gold-coast-sporting-graveyard-20120404-1wckb.html |date=5 January 2017 }}.

Formerly an [[IndyCar]] event, [[Supercars Championship|V8 Supercars]] are now the headline attraction, using a shorter track route, as the circuit was limited following the construction of the [[G:link|Gold Coast Light Rail]] as the Light Rail line replaced the northbound traffic lanes on Surfers Paradise Boulevard which was previously used as the southern section of the street circuit.

Each June, Coolangatta hosts [[Cooly Rocks On]], a two-week 1950s and 1960s nostalgia festival with free entertainment and attractions, including [[hot rod]]s, restored cars and revival bands playing music of the era. Every July, more than 25,000 congregate on the Gold Coast from around the world to participate in the [[Gold Coast Marathon]]. It is also the largest annual community sporting event held on the Gold Coast. In 2015, it will be held on 4–5 July and the 37th Gold Coast Airport Marathon is set to motivate and challenge more than 25,000 people of all ages and abilities. The [[Gold Coast Airport Marathon]] will feature an event for all ages and abilities, including the full Gold Coast Airport Marathon, ASICS Half Marathon, [[Southern Cross University]] {{convert|10|km|mi}} Run, Suncorp Bank {{convert|5.7|km|mi}} Challenge, and Junior Dash over {{convert|4|and|2|km|mi}}.

Late November to early December sees thousands of school leavers across the country descend on the Gold Coast for [[Schoolies week]], a two-week period of celebration and parties throughout Surfers Paradise, hosted by the [[City of Gold Coast]]. The event is often criticised nationally and locally for its portrayal of drinking and acts of violence, however every effort by the [[Queensland Police Service]] and State Government to ensure all school leavers have a good time are put into place, including locals volunteering by walking the streets and keeping an eye out for those in need of assistance. Early each year the Gold Coast hosts one leg of the [[ASP World Tour]] of surfing, where some of the world's best surfers compete in the [[Quiksilver Pro]] at Coolangatta.

[[The Arts Centre Gold Coast]] located in Evandale, features a fine art gallery featuring local and international works from painting to sculpture and new media.

In 2018, 61.6% of the city's population was [[overweight]] or [[obese]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mackay tops list of state's heaviest adults with over 80 per cent overweight or obese – ABC News |url=https://amp.abc.net.au/article/9370172 |access-date=2 June 2023 |archive-date=5 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230605223110/https://amp.abc.net.au/article/9370172 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Infrastructure ==

===Utilities===
'''Electricity'''

Electricity for the Gold Coast is sourced from Powerlink Queensland at bulk supply substations which is provided via the [[National Electricity Market]] from an interconnected multi-State power system. The Government-owned electricity corporation [[Energex]] distributes and retails electricity, natural gas, [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) and value-added products and services to residential, industrial and commercial customers in South-East Queensland.
[[File:Hinze Dam 2019.11.08.jpg|thumb|[[Hinze Dam]]]]
'''Water supply'''

The [[Hinze Dam]] {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Nerang is the population's main water supply. The [[Little Nerang Dam]] which feeds into [[Hinze Dam]] can supplement part of the city area's water needs, and both are managed by the city council directorate [[Gold Coast Water]]. Reforms of the way in which the [[water industry]] is structured have been announced by the State Government, with transfer of ownership and management of water services from local government to the state occurring in 2008–09. [[City of Gold Coast]] also sources water from [[Wivenhoe Dam]], west of Brisbane for northern suburbs when the Hinze Dam, at one-tenth of Wivenhoe's capacity, becomes low.

Water shortage and water restrictions have been current local issues, and a few new Gold Coast residential areas have recently included dual reticulation in their planning and development to supply water from a new water recycling plant being built concurrently. This will make available highly treated recycled water for use around the home in addition to potable water. The Gold Coast has received world recognition for this scheme in its Pimpama-Coomera suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_gcw.asp?PID=5909 |title=Gold Coast City Council – Pimpama Coomera Master Plan Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Gold Coast City Council |access-date=2 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102084652/http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_gcw.asp?PID=5909 |archive-date=2 January 2009 }}</ref>

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport on the Gold Coast, Queensland}}The car is the dominant mode of transport in the Gold Coast, with over 70% of people using it as their sole mode of travelling to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&documentproductno=LGA33460&documenttype=Details&order=1&tabname=Details&areacode=LGA33460&issue=2006&producttype=Census%20Tables&javascript=true&textversion=false&navmapdisplayed=true&breadcrumb=LPTD&&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Method%20of%20Travel%20to%20Work%20by%20Sex&producttype=Census%20Tables&method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&topic=Transport%20Access%20&%20Use&|title=Method of Travel to Work by Sex&nbsp;– Gold Coast (Local Government Area)|date=27 June 2007|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|format=Excel Spreadsheet|access-date=12 April 2008|quote=Consists of people who solely either drove or travelled as a passenger in a car to work.}}{{Dead link|date=December 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Gold Coast has an extensive network of arterial roads that link coastal suburbs with inland suburbs. In recent years, local and state governments have invested money in transport infrastructure on the Gold Coast to combat the increasing congestion on many of the city's roads. The Gold Coast has an extensive public transport network that includes buses, heavy rail and light rail for commuting to work, visiting attractions, and travelling to other destinations. 
[[File:Skylines of Main Beach and Surfers Paradise, Queensland in January 2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Gold Coast Highway]] and [[G:link]] crossing the [[Nerang River]]]]

==== Road ====
A number of major roads connect the Gold Coast with Brisbane, New South Wales, and the surrounding areas. The [[Pacific Motorway (Brisbane–Brunswick Heads)|Pacific Motorway]] (M1) is the main motorway in the area. Beginning at the [[Logan Motorway]] (M6) in Brisbane, it travels through the inland Gold Coast region and links with the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]] at the New South Wales/Queensland border near [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]]. The Pacific Motorway is part of the [[Brisbane]] to [[Sydney]] corridor. Before the [[Tugun Bypass]] was completed in 2008, the motorway ended at [[Tugun, Queensland|Tugun]]. The [[Gold Coast Highway]] services the coastal suburbs of the Gold Coast, including Surfers Paradise, Southport, and Burleigh Heads. Starting at the Pacific Motorway at Tweed Heads, it runs parallel to the coast until it reaches Labrador, where it turns inland to meet the Pacific Motorway again at [[Helensvale]]. Other arterial roads include the [[Smith Street Motorway]] which connects Southport, Gold Coast's CBD with the [[Pacific Motorway (Brisbane–Brunswick Heads)|M1]] in [[Parkwood, Queensland|Parkwood]]. Other major roads include Reedy Creek Road, [[Nerang–Broadbeach Road]], [[Robina Parkway]] and [[Southport – Burleigh Road|Southport–Burleigh Road]].

==== Light rail ====
