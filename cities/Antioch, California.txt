'''Antioch''' is the third-most populous city in [[Contra Costa County, California]], United States. The city is located in the [[East Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] along the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]]. The city's population was 115,291 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]].<ref name="quif"/> The city has grown substantially more diverse since the 1970s.<ref name="U.S. Census Bureau">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Antioch city, California|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/antiochcitycalifornia/PST045219=true|access-date=April 20, 2021|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:José Noriega (Mayor of San Jose).jpg|thumb|left|Don [[José Noriega]], a wealthy [[Californio]] ranchero, was granted [[Rancho Los Méganos]] in 1835.]]

===Early history===
Antioch is one of the oldest towns in the region. The town has been variously named '''East Antioch''', '''Smith's Landing''',<ref>Both {{gnis|1657936}}</ref> and '''Marsh's Landing''',<ref name=CGN /> prior to its current name.

In 1848, [[John Marsh (pioneer)|John Marsh]], owner of [[Rancho Los Méganos]], one of the largest ranches in California, built a landing on the [[San Joaquin River]] in what is now Antioch. It became known as Marsh's Landing, and was the shipping point for the {{convert|17,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} rancho. It included a pier extending well out into the river, enabling vessels drawing {{convert|15|ft|m}} of water to tie up there in any season of the year. The landing also included a slaughterhouse, a smokehouse for curing hams, rodeo grounds, and a {{Fraction|1|1|2}}-story dwelling, embellished with fretwork, that was brought around the Horn to serve as a home for the [[Majordomo|mayordomo]] and his wife.<ref>Lyman, George D. John Marsh, Pioneer: The Life Story of a Trail-Blazer on Six Frontiers, pp. 280-1, The Chautauqua Press, Chautauqua, New York, 1931.</ref>

[[File:John Marsh, Pioneer, 1852.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[John Marsh (pioneer)|John Marsh]] in 1852]]

In 1849, twin brothers Rev. William Wiggins Smith and Rev. Joseph Horton Smith<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Transcription of The Diary of William Wiggins Smith|publisher=his son Charles H. Smith|year=1941–1942|location=Contra Costa County Library Antioch Branch}}</ref> sailed from Boston, purchased land from John Marsh<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking Back - Tales of Old Antioch (CA) and Other Places|publisher=Earl Hohlmayer|year=1991|location=Contra Costa County Library Antioch Branch|isbn=978-0-9651251-1-6 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Back-Tales-Antioch-Places/dp/B002F6T8FU}}</ref> and founded a town slightly west of Marsh's Landing, and named it Smith's Landing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antioch To The Twenties|publisher=Elise S Benyo|year=1972|location=Contra Costa County Library, Antioch, CA|url=https://www.amazon.com/Antioch-twenties-Elise-S-Benyo/dp/B0006C6XPI}}</ref> During the town picnic on July 4, 1851, William, the town's new minister, persuaded the residents to change the name of the town to Antioch, for the [[Bible|biblical]] city of [[Antioch]],<ref name=gudde>{{cite book|first=Erwin|last=Gudde|author2=William Bright|title=California Place Names|year=2004|edition=Fourth|publisher=University of California Press|page=15|isbn=978-0-520-24217-3}}</ref> "in as much as the first settlers were disciples of Christ, and one of them had died and was buried on the land, that it be given a Bible name in his honor, and suggested 'Antioch' (an ancient Syrian town where two important rivers meet and where the followers of Christ were first called Christians), and by united acclamation it was so christened."

Around 1859, coal was discovered in several places in the hills south of Antioch, and coal mining formed the first substantial business apart from farming and dairying for the inhabitants of this community. This new industry resulted in the founding of the towns of Nortonville, Somersville, Stewartville, and Black Diamond (now [[Pittsburg, California|Pittsburg]]), and added greatly to the economic activity of the Antioch area. The Empire Coal Company was formed by John C. Rouse and George Hawxhurst in 1876, which built a railroad that passed from Antioch toward the mines over what is now "F Street" (formerly Kimball Street). However, later on, both the mine and the railroad passed into the hands of the Belshaw brothers. The mines have long since ceased operation, and the railroad tracks have been dug up, though the building that served as the Antioch terminus of the railroad still stands on the corner of F Street and Fourth Street, and the grading and trestles still remain much as they were in those early days.

In 1863, a great excitement arose over the discovery of [[copper]] ore near Antioch. Smelting works were built at Antioch, and the ore fetched $15 to $25 per ton. The copper bubble eventually burst, to the dismay of the citizens, and petroleum was first drilled for near Antioch in 1865, but not enough oil was found to make a decent profit.

The Antioch Post Office was opened in 1851, closed in 1852, reopened in 1855, closed again in 1862, and has operated continuously since reopening in 1863.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|595}}</ref> The city of Antioch was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1872.<ref name=CGN />

The ''[[Antioch Daily Ledger|Antioch Ledger]]'' was first issued on March 10, 1870. To commemorate the paper's formation, a copy of its first issue has been framed and hangs over the desk of the present editor. The sole news item is a report with editorial comment on a women's suffrage meeting that had just been held in the town. The ''Ledger'' later merged with the ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' and printed its last issue in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/contracosta/1917-ch27.htm|title=>ENAMBET > Gabung Dan Main Bandar Live Casino Teresmi|accessdate=February 25, 2024}}</ref> The Time's weekly publication, the Antioch News, which is an expansion of the Brentwood News is published each Friday. The Antioch Press published its first issue in January 2001, direct mailing newspapers to all homes and businesses in the city twice monthly, and then weekly from September 2005 until the 2008 economic crash. It continued to publish and distribute only in racks and stacks throughout town until June 2012. It was then only published online until 2020 when it was combined with the Brentwood Press, Oakley Press and Discovery Bay Press into one paper, distributed in stacks and racks throughout the city as, The Press (www.thepress.net). The Antioch Herald (www.AntiochHerald.com) was first launched online in October 2010 and then expanded to print in May 2011, mailing to homes and businesses in Antioch each month. As of 2021, due to the impacts on businesses from the COVID-19-related government health orders, the "Herald" is only available online. A strictly online news source, EastCountyToday.net was launched in July 2012 covering Antioch and the other three cities and five unincorporated communities in eastern Contra Costa County.

The city's historic Chinese community, which was forcibly segregated,<ref>Pfaelzer, Jean, Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans, 90-91 (Random House New York 2007)</ref> was estimated to number in the hundreds in the late 1800s.{{r|TMN 2021-04-14}} The city's early history included banning Chinese residents from walking the streets after sundown.{{r|KTVU 2021-04-14}} In 1876, the Chinatown was burned down due to arson; the fire department refused to put out the fire.<ref>Driven Out at 90-91; ABC7 April 14, 2021}</ref> For nearly 100 years, virtually no Chinese lived in Antioch.

Antioch is mainly a bedroom community, with most adults working in larger cities toward [[Oakland]] and [[San Francisco]]. The town has grown in the last 30 years, as the population of the Bay Area continues to grow, and real estate prices force families to move towards the outskirts of the Bay Area.{{r|SFG 2021-04-15}}

Antioch's inland location lying in the border of the Central Valley and Bay Area results in hotter temperatures in the summer and colder nights in the winter in contrast to the rest of the Bay Area. However, its location on the delta allows for a slight maritime effect allowing for day time highs to be a few degrees cooler than the neighboring valley cities.

===Burrowing owl protection===
[[File:Burrowing Owl in Antioch 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Threatened burrowing owl in Antioch]]
In late 2008, [[Burrowing owl|western burrowing owl]]s (''Athene cunicularia'') moved into a {{convert|25|acre|ha|adj=on}} housing development slated for construction.<ref>{{cite news | title=Kiper Homes announces {{sic|i|t's|nolink=y}} model grand opening at Blue Ridge in Antioch this weekend|newspaper=Mercury News|date=May 4, 2012|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/real-estate-131220/ci_20551913/kiper-homes-announces-its-model-grand-opening-at}}</ref> In November 2009 the [[California Department of Fish & Game]] gave the developer permission to evict the owls before nesting season begins in February 2010. The birds regularly reuse burrows for years, and there is no requirement that suitable new habitat be found for the owls. Despite being listed as a [[California species of special concern|Species of Special Concern]] (a pre-listing category under the [[Endangered Species Act]]) by the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] in 1979, California's population declined 60 percent from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8 percent per year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Owl Be Damned:Developers plow into the homes of the burrowing owl |author=Rendon, Jim |newspaper=Metro, Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper |date=Nov–Dec 1999 |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.24.99/cover/species5-9947.html }}</ref> In 1994, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] nominated the western burrowing owl as a federal Category 2 candidate for listing as endangered or threatened, but loss of habitat continues due to development of the flat, grassy lands used by the owl.

Their status protects them from disturbance during nesting season or killing at any time, but does not guarantee them a permanent home, as outside of breeding season, owls can be removed.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Antioch Developer Evicts Burrowing Owls |author=Donna Whitmarsh |journal=Bay Nature |url=http://baynature.org/articles/web-only-articles/burrowing-owls-antioch/?searchterm=burrowing%20owl |access-date=January 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004163015/http://baynature.org/articles/web-only-articles/burrowing-owls-antioch/?searchterm=burrowing%20owl |archive-date=October 4, 2011 }}</ref> In November 2009, a local resident tallied 11 owls in the area, including four pairs.
