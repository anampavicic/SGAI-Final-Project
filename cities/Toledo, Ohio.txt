The city was founded in 1833 on the west bank of the [[Maumee River]] and originally incorporated as part of the [[Michigan Territory]]. It was re-founded in 1837 after the conclusion of the [[Toledo War]], when it was incorporated in Ohio. After the 1845 completion of the [[Miami and Erie Canal]], Toledo grew quickly; it also benefited from its position on the railway line between [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]]. The first of many glass manufacturers arrived in the 1880s, eventually earning Toledo its nickname as "The Glass City". [[Downtown Toledo]] has been subject to major revitalization efforts, including a growing [[Warehouse District (Toledo, Ohio)|entertainment district]]. Toledo is home to the [[University of Toledo]].

==History==
{{For timeline}}
The region was part of a larger area controlled by the historic tribes of the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] and the people of the [[Council of Three Fires]] ([[Ojibwe]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Odawa]]). The French established trading posts in the area by 1680 to take advantage of the lucrative [[fur trade]]. The Odawa moved from [[Manitoulin Island]] and the [[Bruce Peninsula]] at the invitation of the French, who established a trading post at [[Fort Detroit]], about 60 miles to the north. They settled an area extending into northwest Ohio. By the early 18th century, the Odawa-occupied areas along most of the Maumee River to its mouth. They served as middlemen between the French and tribes further to the west and north. The Wyandot occupied central Ohio, and the [[Shawnee]] and [[Lenape]] occupied the southern areas.<ref>''Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History'' (University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, 1986) pp. 3, 58–59</ref><ref>R. Douglas Hurt, ''The Ohio Frontier: Crucible of the Old Northwest, 1720–1830'' (Indiana University Press: Bloomington, 1998), pp. 8–12</ref>

When the city of Toledo was preparing to pave its streets, it surveyed "two prehistoric semicircular [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]], presumably for [[stockade]]s." One was at the intersection of Clayton and Oliver Streets on the south bank of Swan Creek; the other was at the intersection of Fassett and Fort Streets on the right bank of the Maumee River.<ref name="slocum"/> Such earthworks were typical of mound-building peoples.

===19th century===
According to Charles E. Slocum, the American military built [[Fort Industry]] at the mouth of Swan Creek about 1805, as a temporary stockade. No official reports support the 19th-century tradition of its earlier history there.<ref name="slocum">[http://ohahgp.genealogyvillage.com/Resources/forts-miami-and-fort-industry.html Charles E. Slocum, "Forts Miami and Fort Industry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227075851/http://ohahgp.genealogyvillage.com/Resources/forts-miami-and-fort-industry.html |date=December 27, 2015 }}, ''Ohio Archaeological and Historical Publications,'' Volume XII, 1903; hosted at American History and Genealogy Project, accessed December 26, 2015</ref>

The United States continued to work to transition the area's population from Native Americans to Whites. In the [[Treaty of Detroit]] (1807), the above four tribes ceded a large land area to the United States of what became southeastern Michigan and northwestern Ohio, to the mouth of the Maumee River (where Toledo later developed). Reserves for the Odawa were set aside in northwestern Ohio for a limited time. The Native Americans signed the treaty at [[Detroit, Michigan]], on November 17, 1807, with [[William Hull]], governor of the Michigan Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs, as the sole representative of the U.S.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2746/ |title=Treaty Between the Ottawa, Chippewa, Wyandot, and Potawatomi Indians |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=November 17, 1807 |access-date=August 3, 2013 |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508212426/https://www.wdl.org/en/item/2746/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

More American settlers entered the area over the next few years, but many fled during the [[War of 1812]], when British forces raided the area with their Native American allies. Resettlement began around 1818 after a Cincinnati syndicate purchased a {{convert|974|acre|km2|1|adj=mid}} tract at the mouth of Swan Creek and named it Port Lawrence, developing it as the [[Downtown Toledo|modern downtown area]] of Toledo. Immediately to the north of that, another syndicate founded the town of Vistula, the historic north end.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite book |title=The Ohio Guide |year=1940 |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |publisher=US History Publishers |isbn=9781603540346}}</ref> These two towns bordered each other across Cherry Street. This is why present-day streets on the street's northeast side run at a slightly different angle from those southwest of it.

In 1824, the Ohio state legislature authorized the construction of the [[Miami and Erie Canal]], and in 1833, its [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] extension. The canal's purpose was to connect the city of Cincinnati to [[Lake Erie]] for water transportation to eastern markets, including to New York City via the Erie Canal and Hudson River. At that time, no highways had been built in the state, and goods produced locally had great difficulty reaching the larger markets east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. During the canal's planning phase, many small towns along the northern shores of the Maumee River heavily competed to be the ending terminus of the canal, knowing it would give them a profitable status.<ref name="Gieck 1913">{{Cite book |last=Gieck |first=Jack |title=A Photo Album of Ohio's Canal Era, 1825–1913 |location=Kent |publisher=Kent State University Press |year=1988 |isbn=9780873383530}}</ref> The towns of Port Lawrence and Vistula merged in 1833 to better compete against the upriver towns of [[Waterville, Ohio|Waterville]] and [[Maumee, Ohio|Maumee]].

The inhabitants of this joined settlement chose the name Toledo: 
<blockquote>"but the reason for this choice is buried in a welter of legends. One recounts that [[Washington Irving]], who was traveling in Spain at the time, suggested the name to his brother, a local resident; this explanation ignores the fact that Irving returned to the United States in 1832. Others award the honor to Two Stickney, son of the major who quaintly numbered his sons and named his daughters after States. The most popular version attributes the naming to Willard J. Daniels, a merchant, who reportedly suggested Toledo because it 'is easy to pronounce, is pleasant in sound, and there is no other city of that name on the American continent.'"<ref name="ReferenceA"/></blockquote>Despite Toledo's efforts, the canal built the final terminus in Manhattan, {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=out|spell=in}} to the north of Toledo, because it was closer to Lake Erie. As a compromise, the state placed two sidecuts before the terminus, one in Toledo at Swan Creek and another in [[Maumee, Ohio|Maumee]], about 10 miles to the southwest.

Among the numerous treaties made between the Ottawa and the United States were two signed in this area: at Miami (Maumee) Bay in 1831 and Maumee, Ohio, upriver of Toledo, in 1833.<ref name="hodge">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fxoTAAAAYAAJ&q=Ondatauauat&pg=PA167 |title=Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico: N-Z |page=167 |website=Books.google.com |access-date=May 23, 2016 |last1=Hodge |first1=Frederick Webb |year=1910 |archive-date=May 23, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240523050245/https://books.google.com/books?id=fxoTAAAAYAAJ&q=Ondatauauat&pg=PA167#v=onepage&q=Ondatauauat&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> These actions were among US purchases or exchanges of land to accomplish [[Indian Removal]] of the Ottawa from areas wanted for European-American settlement.

An almost bloodless conflict between Ohio and the Michigan Territory, called the [[Toledo War]] (1835–1836), was "fought" over a narrow strip of land from the [[Indiana]] border to [[Lake Erie]], now containing the city and the suburbs of [[Sylvania, Ohio|Sylvania]] and [[Oregon, Ohio]]. The strip, which varied between five and {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} in width, was claimed by both the state of Ohio and the Michigan Territory due to conflicting legislation concerning the location of the Ohio-Michigan state line. Militias from both states were sent to the border, but never engaged. The only casualty of the conflict was a Michigan deputy [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]]—stabbed in the leg with a penknife by Two Stickney during the arrest of his elder brother, One Stickney—and the loss of two horses, two pigs, and a few chickens stolen from an Ohio farm by lost members of the Michigan militia. Major Benjamin Franklin Stickney, father of One and Two Stickney, had been instrumental in pushing Congress to rule in favor of Ohio gaining Toledo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2000/12/24/Benjamin-Franklin-Stickney-His-remarkable-life-and-times.html |work=The Blade |title=Benjamin Franklin Stickney: His remarkable life and times |date=December 24, 2000 |access-date=December 16, 2016 |first=George J. |last=Tanber |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116002959/http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2000/12/24/Benjamin-Franklin-Stickney-His-remarkable-life-and-times.html |archive-date=November 16, 2015}}</ref> In the end, the state of Ohio was awarded the land after the state of Michigan was given a larger portion of the [[Upper Peninsula]] in exchange.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1265 |work=Professional Surveyor Magazine |title=History Corner: Ohio-Michigan Boundary War, Part 2 |date=June 2004 |access-date=August 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093839/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1265 |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |first=Gordon |last=Mitchell}}</ref> Stickney Avenue in Toledo is named for Major Stickney.

Toledo was very slow to expand during its first two decades of settlement. The first lot was sold in the Port Lawrence section of the city in 1833. It held 1,205 persons in 1835, and five years later, it had gained just seven more persons. Settlers came and went quickly through Toledo and between 1833 and 1836, ownership of land had changed so many times that none of the original parties remained in the town. The canal and its Toledo sidecut entrance were completed in 1843. Soon after the canal was functional, the new canal boats had become too large to use the shallow waters at the terminus in Manhattan. More boats began using the Swan Creek sidecut than its official terminus, quickly putting the Manhattan warehouses out of business and triggering a rush to move business to Toledo. Most of Manhattan's residents moved out by 1844.

The 1850 census recorded Toledo as having 3,829 residents and Manhattan 541. The 1860 census shows Toledo with a population of 13,768 and Manhattan with 788. While the towns were only a mile apart, Toledo grew by 359% in 10 years. Manhattan's growth was on a small base and never competed, given the drawbacks of its lesser canal outlet. By the 1880s, Toledo expanded over the vacant streets of Manhattan and Tremainsville, a small town to the west.<ref name="Gieck 1913"/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Simonis |first=Louis A. |title=Maumee River, 1835 |location=Defiance |publisher=Defiance County Historical Society |year=1979}}</ref>

In the last half of the 19th century, railroads slowly began to replace canals as the major form of transportation. They were faster and had greater capacity. Toledo soon became a hub for several railroad companies and a hotspot for industries such as furniture producers, carriage makers, breweries, and glass manufacturers. Large [[immigrant]] populations came to the area.

In the 1920s, Toledo had one of the highest rates of industrial growth in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.toledosattic.org/essays/culthistory/92-abstracts/culthistory/116-ess-toledotopics |title=Toledo Topics: Life at the Top in Jazz Age Toledo |first=Timothy |last=Messer-Kruse |work=[[Toledo's Attic]] |location=Toledo |access-date=May 5, 2020 |archive-date=August 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805053002/https://toledosattic.org/essays/culthistory/92-abstracts/culthistory/116-ess-toledotopics |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Toledo continued to expand in population and industry, but because of its dependence on manufacturing, the city was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]]. Many large-scale [[Works Progress Administration]] projects were constructed to re-employ citizens in the 1930s. Some of these include the amphitheater and aquarium at the [[Toledo Zoo]] and a major expansion to the [[Toledo Museum of Art]].

[[File:Toledo Streetcar.jpg|thumb|A streetcar in Toledo, 1949]]
The postwar job boom and [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] brought thousands of [[African Americans]] to Toledo to work in industrial jobs, where they had previously been denied. Due to [[redlining]], many of them settled along Dorr Street, which, during the 1950s and 1960s was lined with flourishing black-owned businesses and homes. [[Desegregation in the United States|Desegregation]], a failed [[urban renewal]] project, and the construction of [[I-75]] displaced those residents and left behind a struggling community with minimal resources, even as it also drew more established, middle-class people, white and black, out of center cities for newer housing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.toledoblade.com/local/2015/04/26/Poor-decisions-accelerated-decline/stories/20150425181 |title=Downtown Toledo: What went wrong? |website=Toledo Blade |access-date=May 6, 2020 |archive-date=January 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116185148/https://www.toledoblade.com/local/2015/04/26/Poor-decisions-accelerated-decline/stories/20150425181 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city rebounded, but the slump of American manufacturing in the second half of the 20th century during industrial restructuring cost many jobs.

On the evening of August 1, 2014, the city of Toledo issued a warning to citizens advising against the use of city water, leaving more than half a million people suddenly without water.<ref name="greatlakes.org"/> A bloom of toxic [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green algae]] had formed directly over Toledo's water intake pipe, which was situated a few miles off shore in Lake Erie.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Because of the algae bloom forming just above the pipe, the water being pumped into Toledo showed levels of harmful bacteria that made the water unsafe to interact with.

===Climate===
Toledo, as with much of the [[Great Lakes]] region, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), characterized by four distinct seasons. Lake Erie moderates the climate somewhat, especially in late spring and fall, when air and water temperature differences are maximal. However, this effect is lessened in the winter because Lake Erie (unlike the other Great Lakes) usually freezes over, coupled with prevailing winds that are often westerly, and in the summer, prevailing winds south and west over the lake bring heat and humidity to the city.

Summers are very warm and humid, with July averaging {{convert|75.4|°F|1}} and temperatures of {{convert|90|°F|0}} or more seen on 18.8 days.<ref name = "NOWData NWS Cleveland, OH (CLE) - TOLthr"/> Winters are cold and somewhat snowy, with a January mean temperature of {{convert|27.5|°F|1}}, and lows at or below {{convert|0|°F|0}} on 5.6 nights.<ref name = "NOWData NWS Cleveland, OH (CLE) - TOLthr"/> The spring months tend to be the wettest time of year, although precipitation is common year-round. November and December can get very cloudy, but January and February usually clear up after the lake freezes. July is the sunniest month overall.<ref name=NOAAsun/> About {{convert|37|in|cm|0}} of snow falls per year, much less than the [[Snow Belt]] cities, because of the prevailing wind direction. Temperature extremes have ranged from {{convert|-20|°F|0}} on January 21, 1984, to {{convert|105|°F|0}} on [[1936 North American heat wave|July 14, 1936]].

Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], Toledo was important as a port city on the [[Great Lakes]]. With the advent of the automobile, the city became best known for industrial manufacturing. Both [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] had factories in metropolitan Toledo, and automobile manufacturing has been important at least since [[Kirk Manufacturing Company (automobile company)|Kirk]] started manufacturing automobiles,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=158}}</ref> which began operations early in the 20th century. The largest employer in Toledo was [[Jeep]] for much of the 20th century. Since the late 20th century, industrial restructuring reduced the number of these well-paying jobs.

The [[University of Toledo]] is influential in the city, contributing to the prominence of healthcare as the city's biggest employer. The metro area contains four [[Fortune 500]] companies: [[Dana Holding Corporation]], [[Owens Corning]], [[The Andersons]], and [[Owens Illinois]]. [[ProMedica]] is a [[Fortune 1000]] company headquartered in Toledo. One SeaGate is the location of [[Fifth Third Bank]]'s Northwest Ohio headquarters.

===Glass industry===
Toledo is known as the Glass City because of its long history of glass manufacturing, including [[window]]s, [[bottle]]s, [[windshield]]s, [[construction|construction materials]], and [[glass art]], of which the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] has a large collection. Several large glass companies have their origins here. [[Owens-Illinois]], [[Owens Corning]], [[Libbey Incorporated]], [[Pilkington]] North America (formerly [[Libbey-Owens-Ford]]), and [[Fortune Brands Home & Security|Therma-Tru]] have long been a staple of Toledo's economy. Other offshoots of these companies also continue to play important roles in Toledo's economy. Fiberglass giant [[Johns Manville]]'s two plants in the metro area were originally built by a subsidiary of Libbey-Owens-Ford.

===Automotive industry===
Several Fortune 500 automotive-related companies had their headquarters in Toledo, including [[Autolite|Electric AutoLite]], [[Sheller-Globe Corporation]], [[Champion (spark plug)|Champion Spark Plug]], Questor, and [[Dana Holding Corporation]]. Only the latter still operates as an independent entity.

Faurecia Exhaust Systems, a subsidiary of France's [[Faurecia]] SA, is in Toledo.

Toledo is the Jeep headquarters and has two production facilities dubbed the [[Toledo Complex]], one in the city and one in suburban Perrysburg. During World War II, the city's industries produced important products for the military, particularly the [[Willys Jeep]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Toledo, Ohio |work=Ohio History Central |date=July 1, 2005 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=808 |access-date=August 4, 2014 |archive-date=March 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321170239/http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=808 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Willys-Overland]] was a major automaker headquartered in Toledo until 1953.

Industrial restructuring and loss of jobs caused the city to adopt new strategies to retain its industrial companies. It offered tax incentives to [[DaimlerChrysler]] to expand its Jeep plant. In 2001, a taxpayer lawsuit was filed against Toledo that challenged the constitutionality of that action. In 2006, the city won the case by a unanimous ruling by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno]]''.

General Motors also has operated a [[Toledo Transmission|transmission plant]] in Toledo since 1916. It manufactures and assembles GM's six-speed and eight-speed rear-wheel-drive and six-speed front-wheel-drive transmissions that are used in a variety of GM vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Toledo Transmission |url=https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/powertrain/toledo.html |website=media.gm.com |publisher=GM |access-date=November 24, 2018 |archive-date=January 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117222712/https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/powertrain/toledo.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Railroads in the past====
Historically, Toledo was a major rail hub where the [[New York Central]] (later, the [[Penn Central]]), [[Baltimore and Ohio]], [[Wabash Railroad]], [[Nickel Plate Road]], [[Ann Arbor Railroad (1895–1976)|Ann Arbor Railroad]], [[Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad]], [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]]/[[Pere Marquette Railway]], [[Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (1916–1988)|Wheeling and Lake Erie]] railroads moved a large amount of freight to and from Toledo's many industries such as Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass, and Willys-Overland (Jeep) Motors. Most of these companies used [[Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza (Toledo)#Central Union Terminal (1950-1971)|Central Union Terminal]] on Emerald Avenue. The Ann Arbor Railroad used its station on Cherry Street. The Pennsylvania Railroad used its station on Summit Street.<ref>Railroad maps of the 1930s-40s; and Toledo Municipal corporation records.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Index of Railroad Stations, 1468 |journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=87 |issue=7 |date=December 1954}}</ref>

Seven interurban companies radiated from Toledo. In the early 1930s, three of the seven, the Cincinnati and Lake Erie from Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, the Lake Shore Electric from Cleveland, and the Eastern Michigan Ry from Detroit, moved a large amount of freight and number of passengers between those heavily industrialized cities. The Great Depression and growing inter city competition from trucks on newly improved roads by the Ohio caused abandonment of all by 1938, and some interurban lines much earlier.<ref>The Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad, Keenan, Jack: Golden West Books, San Marino, CA, 1974. {{ISBN|0-87095-055-X}}: p77-79.</ref> The interurban station where all lines met and exchanged passengers was on N.
