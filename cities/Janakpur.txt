==Etymology==
Janakpurdham, popularly known as Janakpur is Named after the late King of Videha in  [[Mithila region]] - ''[[Janaka]]''.The rulers of the Videha kingdom were accorded the title Janaka, meaning 'father' in [[Sanskrit]], and this character is the best-known bearer of the same.

== History ==
{{See also|Mithila Kingdom|History of Mithila Region}}
[[File:ratnasagar.jpg|thumb|left|Ratna Sagar, Janakpur]]
Accounts from [[ascetic]]s, [[pandit]]s, and [[bard]]s indicate that Janakpur was founded in the early 18th century. The earliest description of Janakpur as a [[Pilgrimage#Hinduism|pilgrimage]] site dates to 1805. Earlier [[archaeological]] evidence of the presence of an ancient city has not been found and there is a lack of evidence to assign the modern-day city of Janakpur with the ancient capital of the [[Videha]] kingdom.<ref name=Burghart1978/>

Until the 1950s, Janakpur was a cluster of rural hamlets inhabited by farmers, artisans, priests, and clerks who worked for the monasteries that controlled the land. After [[Indian Independence Act 1947|the Independence Act in India]], Janakpur expanded into a commercial center and became the capital of the Dhanusa District in the 1960s.<ref name="Burghart88">Burghart, R. (1988.) Cultural knowledge of hygiene and sanitation as a basis for health development in Nepal. Contributions to Nepalese Studies 15 (2): 185–211.</ref>

[[Gautama Buddha]] and Vardhamana [[Mahavira]], the 24th and final ''[[Tirthankara]]'' of the [[Jain]] religion are said to have lived in Janakpur. The region was an important center for the history of Mithila during the [[1st millennium|first millennium]].<ref name="Samiti">Rastriya Samachar Samiti (2004). [http://thehimalayantimes.com/business/more-indian-tourists-visit-janakpurdham/ "More Indian tourists visit Janakpurdham"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802084413/https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/more-indian-tourists-visit-janakpurdham/ |date=2 August 2017 }}. Himalayan Times, 17 January 2004.</ref>
Following the Sugauli Treaty in 1816 between the Nepali rulers and the British East India Company, the northern part of ancient Mithila state, including Janakpur, became part of Nepal, while the southern part went into India.

The paintings on pottery, walls, and courtyards made by Maithili women are known as [[Madhubani art|Mithila art]].

Janakpur attracts migrants from the surrounding area, moving to the city for medical care, education, and jobs. The largest employers were the Janakpur Cigarette Factory Limited and Janakpur Railway until they closed in 2013 due to political corruption and heavy loans.  By the end of 2018 service was resumed.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Janakpur railway nears completion |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2018-10-05/janakpur-railway-nears-completion.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181207102910/http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2018-10-05/janakpur-railway-nears-completion.html |archive-date=7 December 2018 |access-date=2018-12-07 |website=kathmandupost.ekantipur.com |language=en}}</ref> Zonal Hospital, Zonal Police, and the Banking Sector help the locals live a relatively easy lifestyle.

=== Religious sites ===
The [[Janaki Mandir]] temple is in the centre of Janakpur, northwest of the market. It is one of the biggest temples in Nepal and was built in 1898 (1955 in the [[Vikram Samvat|Nepali calendar]]) by Queen Brisabhanu Kunwari of [[Tikamgarh]]. It is also called ''Nau Lakha Mandir'' after the cost of construction, said to be nine [[lakh]] gold coins.<ref name="HT">Mishra, K. C. (1996). Pilgrimage centres and tradition in Nepal. In: D. P. Dubey (ed) Rays and Ways of Indian Culture. M.D. Publications Pvt.

Statues of Rama and his brothers Lakshman, Bharat, and Satrughna stand by Sita.

Adjacent to the Janaki Mandir is the Rama Sita Vivaha Mandir, a building that marks the event in which Rama and Sita were married.

The oldest temple in Janakpur is [[Ram Mandir, Janakpur|Sri Ram Temple]], built by the [[Gorkhali]] General [[Amar Singh Thapa]].<ref name="HT" />(citation does not exist, false claim) Pilgrims also visit the over 200 [[Temple tank|sacred ponds]] in the city for ritual baths.
