'''Nicosia''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɪ|k|ə|ˈ|s|iː|ə}}}} also known as '''Lefkosia'''{{efn|[[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|el|{{linktext|Λευκωσία}}}}; {{IPA|el|lɛfko'siɐ|pron}}}} and '''Lefkoşa''',{{efn|[[Turkish language|Turkish]]: {{IPA|tr|lefkoʃa|pron|small=yes}}}} is the capital and largest city of [[Cyprus]]. It is the southeasternmost of all [[EU member states]]' capital cities.

Nicosia has been continuously inhabited for over 4,500 years and has been the capital of Cyprus since the 10th century. It is the last divided capital in Europe; three years after Cyprus [[London and Zürich Agreements|gained independence from British rule]] in 1960, the [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|Bloody Christmas]] conflict between [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]] triggered {{nowrap|island-wide}} [[Cypriot_intercommunal_violence#Crisis_of_1963–1964|intercommunal violence]], and Nicosia's Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities segregated into its south and [[North Nicosia|north]] respectively in 1964. A decade later, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkey invaded Cyprus]] following [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|Greece's successful attempt]] to [[Enosis|take over the island]]. The leaders of the takeover would later step down, but the dividing line running through Nicosia (and the rest of the island, interrupted only briefly by [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|British military bases]]) became a [[demilitarized zone|demilitarised zone]] that remains under the control of Cyprus while heavily policed by the [[United Nations]]; it is now known as the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus]] between the Republic of Cyprus, which is internationally [[Diplomatic recognition|recognised]], and [[Northern Cyprus]], which is recognised only by Turkey. The ongoing dispute between the two communities is known as the [[Cyprus problem]].

Apart from its legislative and administrative functions, Nicosia has established itself as the island's financial capital and its main international business centre.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kempen|first1=Ronald van|last2=Vermeulen|first2=Marcel|last3=Baan|first3=Ad|title=Urban Issues and Urban Policies in the New EU Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHou6czhjqwC&pg=PA207|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-4511-5|page=207}}</ref> In 2018, Nicosia was the 32nd richest city in the world in relative purchasing power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ubs.com/microsites/prices-earnings/en/cities/nicosia/?year=2018|title=World's richest cities by purchasing power|date=2018|publisher=UBS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803125832/https://www.ubs.com/microsites/prices-earnings/en/cities/nicosia/?year%3D2018|archive-date=2018-08-03|url-status=dead|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref> In the 2022 [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]] ranking, Nicosia was classified as a "Beta '''−'''" city ({{lit|[[global city]]}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=The World According to GaWC 2022 |url=https://x.com/GaWC/status/1697034411714158980 |access-date=22 September 2024 |website=Twitter |publisher=Globalization and World Cities}}</ref>

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Prehistoric Nicosia===
{{main|Ledra}}
Nicosia has been in continuous habitation since around {{nowrap|2500 BC}} near the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]], when the first inhabitants settled in the fertile plain of Mesaoria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_arxaia_lefkosia.shtm |title=Nicosia Municipality |publisher=Nicosia.org.cy |access-date=21 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315231529/http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_arxaia_lefkosia.shtm |archive-date=15 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[city-state]] of [[Ledra]] is similarly connected with the area of Nicosia, although the larger share of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean-era]] ruins in the area are at the broad hill of Ayia Paraskevi or Leondari Vounò {{convert|6|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} southeast of central Nicosia.{{sfnp|Hill|1939|p=379}} Ledra is reported as one of the twelve kingdoms of ancient Cyprus built by [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]] after the end of the [[Trojan War]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-10 |title=Nicosia {{!}} Cyprus, Map, History, & Population {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Nicosia |access-date=2024-07-13 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> The kingdom was quickly destroyed. The Cypriot vassal state transcribed as "Lidir" in a 672 BC Assyrian text is generally identified with the remains which have been found nearer to the modern city.{{sfnp|Hill|1939|p=379}} Its ruler Onasagoras{{clarify|date=February 2024}}<!--Assyrian form of name--> was recorded paying tribute to the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] [[list of Assyrian emperors|king]] [[Esarhaddon]].

===Ancient Nicosia===
By 330 BC, Ledra was recorded to be a small unimportant town.<ref>World and its Peoples: Greece and the Eastern Balkans. Marshall Cavendish, 2010.</ref> It is thought that the settlement was economically and politically dependent on the nearby town of [[Chytri]].{{sfnp|Michaelides & al.|2012|p=52}} The main activity of the town inhabitants was farming. During this era, Ledra did not have the huge growth that the other Cypriot coastal towns had, which was primarily based on trade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_lidras.shtm |title=Nicosia Municipality |publisher=Nicosia.org.cy |access-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307153813/http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_lidras.shtm |archive-date=7 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some sources record that it was restored and improved by Leucos, son of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] of [[Ptolemaid Egypt|Egypt]] around {{nowrap|280 BC,}}<ref>{{citation |last= |first= |contribution=[[:s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Nicosia (Cyprus)|Nicosia]] |title=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |edition=11th |volume= |page= |date=1911 |editor=Hugh Chisholm |display-editors=0 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. |location=New York }}.</ref><ref name=sternburg>{{citation |last=Sternberg |first=C. |title=North Cyprus Pocket Guide |publisher=Rüstem Bookshop |location= |year=2006|isbn=9789944968034 |page=29 }}.</ref> although [[Sir George Hill|Hill]] considered this an early modern "fancy" based solely on pseudoetymological speculations.{{sfnp|Hill|1939|p=379}}

In the 4th century, the town was the seat of a bishopric under the name Ledron, Leuteon, or Leucotheon. Its bishop [[Saint Tryphillius|St Tryphillius]] was a student of [[Saint Spyridon|St Spyridon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintsoftheday108.blogspot.com/2011/06/june-13-saint-tryphillius-trifillios-of.html |title=Saint Tryphillius |publisher=Saintsoftheday108.blogspot.com |access-date=10 March 2012}}</ref> Archaeological evidence indicates that the town regained much of its earlier significance in the early Christian period,<ref name="which is abut 58 secs long demetrios4">{{cite book |last1=Michaelides|first1=Demetrios|last2=Pilides|first2=Despina|editor1-last=Michaelides |editor1-first=D. |title=Historic Nicosia |date=2012 |publisher=Rimal Publications |location=Nicosia |pages=4–8|chapter=Nicosia from the Beginnings to the Roman Ledroi}}</ref> and the presence of two or three [[basilica]]s with ''[[opus sectile]]'' decorations, along with marbles decorated with high relief indicate the presence of a relatively prosperous and sophisticated Christian society.<ref>Demetrios and Pallides, p. 59.</ref>

===Medieval Nicosia===
After the destruction of Cyprus's capital [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] by Arab raids in 647, along with extensive damage to other coastal settlements, the economy of the island became much more inward-looking and inland towns gained relative significance. Nicosia benefited from this and functioned as an outlet of the agricultural products from its hinterland, the [[Mesaoria]] plain. It further was at an advantageous position due to its ample water supply. As such, the town developed enough for the [[Byzantine Empire]] to choose Nicosia as the capital of the island around 965, when the [[Byzantine navy]] restored full Byzantine control over the island and it was organized as a [[Theme of Cyprus|theme of the empire]].<ref>Papacostas 2012, p. 103.</ref> The Byzantines moved the island's administration seat to Nicosia primarily for security reasons as coastal towns were often suffering from raids. From that point on it has remained as the capital of Cyprus and was the seat of the Byzantine governor of Cyprus. The last such governor was [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], who declared himself emperor on the island and ruled it from 1183 to 1191.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_mexri_simera.shtm |title=Nicosia Municipality |publisher=Nicosia.org.cy |access-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305172209/http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_mexri_simera.shtm |archive-date=5 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Testimony as late as 1211 indicates that Nicosia was not a walled city at that point and thus that the Byzantines did not build a city wall, thinking that the city's inland location would be sufficient for defense purposes. The Byzantines did, however, build a relatively weak fort within the city.<ref>Papacostas 2012, pp. 83–84.</ref> The economy under Byzantine rule consisted mostly of the trading of agricultural goods, but the town also produced luxury items and metalware due to the presence of the imperial administration.<ref>Papacostas 2012, pp. 99–100.</ref>

On his way to the [[Holy Land]] during the [[Third Crusade]] in 1187, [[Richard I of England]]'s fleet was plagued by storms, making him to stop first at [[Crete]] and then at [[Rhodes]]. Three ships continued on, one of which was carrying [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily]] and [[Berengaria of Navarre]], Richard's bride-to-be. Two of the ships were wrecked off Cyprus, but the ship bearing Joan and Berengaria made it safely to [[Limassol]]. Joan refused to come ashore, fearing she would be captured and held hostage by [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus]], who hated all Franks. Her ship sat at anchor for a full week before Richard finally arrived on 8 May. Outraged at the treatment of his sister and his future bride, Richard invaded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/crusades/3rd/07.shtml |title=The Crusades – home page |publisher=Boisestate.edu |access-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001165212/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/crusades/3rd/07.shtml |archive-date=1 October 2009 }}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Richard laid siege to Nicosia, finally met and defeated Isaac Komnenos at [[Tremetousia]] and became ruler of the island, but sold it to the [[Knights Templar]].

The Frankish rule of Cyprus started from 1192 and lasted until 1489. During this time, Nicosia was the capital of the medieval [[Kingdom of Cyprus]], the seat of [[Lusignan]] kings, the Latin Church and the Frankish administration of the island. During the Frankish rule, the walls of the city were built along with many other palaces and buildings, including the gothic [[St. Sophia Cathedral, Nicosia|St. Sophia Cathedral]]. The tombs of the [[House of Lusignan|Lusignan kings]] can be found there.

In 1489, when Cyprus came under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]], Nicosia became their administrative centre and the seat of the Republic. The Venetian Governors saw it as a necessity for all the cities of Cyprus to be fortified due to the Ottoman threat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_dikoisi_veneton.shtm |title=Nicosia Municipality |publisher=Nicosia.org.cy |access-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305145302/http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_dikoisi_veneton.shtm |archive-date=5 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1567 Venetians built the new fortifications of Nicosia, which are well-preserved still to this day, demolishing the old walls built by the [[Franks]] as well as other important buildings of the Frankish era including the King's Palace, other private palaces and churches and monasteries of both Orthodox and Latin Christians.<ref name="nicosia.org.cy">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_nea_tixi_tzoulio.shtm |title=Nicosia Municipality |publisher=Nicosia.org.cy |access-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306102256/http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_nea_tixi_tzoulio.shtm |archive-date=6 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The new walls took the shape of a star with eleven bastions.

On 1 July 1570, the city came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. On 22 July, [[Piyale Pasha]] having captured Paphos, [[Limassol]] and Larnaca marched his army towards Nicosia and laid siege to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_poliorkia_lefkosias.shtm |title=Nicosia Municipality |publisher=Nicosia.org.cy |access-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307111831/http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_poliorkia_lefkosias.shtm |archive-date=7 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city managed to last 40 days under siege until its fall on 9 September 1570. The story of the Cypriot martyr [[Arnaude de Rocas]] dates from the fall of Nicosia. Some 20,000 residents died during the siege and every church, public building, and palace was looted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historymedren.about.com/library/text/bltxtcyprus5.htm |title=Cyprus – Historical Setting – Ottoman Rule |publisher=Historymedren.about.com |date=17 June 2010 |access-date=10 March 2012}}</ref> Nicosia had an estimated population of 21,000 before the Ottoman conquest, and based on the Ottoman census data of 1572, the population had been reduced to 1,100–1,200.

Nicosia was the seat of the [[Pasha]], the [[Church of Cyprus|Greek Archbishop]], the [[Dragoman]] and the [[Qadi]]. The {{lang|it|Palazzo del Governo}} of Venetian times became the seat of the Pasha, the governor of Cyprus, and the building was renamed as the Konak or Seraglio (Saray). The square outside was known as Seraglio Square or Sarayonu (literally front of the Saray), as it is known to the present day. The saray was demolished in 1904 and the present block of Government Offices built on the site.<ref name=jeffery>A description of the historic monuments of Cyprus. Studies in the archaeology and architecture of the island, by George Jeffery, Architect, 1918</ref>

When the newly settled Turkish population arrived they generally lived in the north of the old riverbed. Greek Cypriots remained concentrated in the south, where the [[Archbishopric]] of the Orthodox Church was built. Other ethnic minority groups such as the Armenians and Latins came to be settled near the western entry into the city at Paphos Gate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conflictincities.org/nicosia.html |title=Nicosia |publisher=Conflictincities.org |access-date=10 March 2012 |archive-date=25 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141625/http://www.conflictincities.org/nicosia.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The names of the 12 quarters into which Nicosia was originally divided at the time of the Ottoman Conquest are said to be derived from the 12 generals in command of divisions of the Ottoman army at the time. Each general being posted to a quarter, that quarter (with two exceptions) was known by his name as follows:

# General Ibrahim Pasha.
# General Mahmoud Pasha.
# General Ak Kavuk Pasha. (This is a nickname meaning "white cap".)
# General Koukoud Effendi.
# General Arab Ahmed Pasha.
# General Abdi Pasha, known as Chavush (Sergeant) from which rank he was probably promoted.
# General Haydar Pasha.
# General Karamanzade (son of a Caramanian, other names not given).
# General Yahya Pasha (now known as the Phaneromeni Quarter).
# General Daniel Pasha (name of quarter changed subsequently to Omerie in honor of the Caliph Omar who stayed there for a night when in Cyprus).
# Tophane (Artillery Barracks)
# Nebetkhane, meaning police station or quarters of the patrol.<ref name=jeffery/>

The names of the generals in command of the last two-quarters have been lost:

Later the number of neighborhoods was increased to 24. Each neighborhood was organized around a mosque or a church, where mainly the respective Muslim and Christian communities lived.<ref name=Coexistence>"Coexistence in the Disappeared Mixed Neighbourhoods of Nicosia", by Ahmet An (Paper read at the conference, "Nicosia: The Last Divided Capital in Europe", organized by the London Metropolitan University on 20 June 2011)</ref>

Nicosia came under the rule of [[British Empire|the United Kingdom]] on 5 July 1878 in consequence of the [[Cyprus Convention]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Nicosia Municipality |url=http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_aglliki_katoxi.shtm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306054708/http://www.nicosia.org.cy/english/lefkosia_istoria_aglliki_katoxi.shtm |archive-date=6 March 2012 |access-date=10 March 2012 |publisher=Nicosia.org.cy}}</ref> in exchange for its support of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Congress of Berlin]].

The old Ottoman administrative headquarters (the Saray) was replaced in 1904 by a new building containing Law Courts, the Land Registry, and the Forestry, Customs, and Nicosia Commissioner's Offices.<ref name=jeffery/> Adjacent was the Nicosia Police headquarters, while opposite were the General Post Office and the Telegraph Office.<ref>See map drawn in 1952 published in "Romantic Cyprus", by Kevork Keshishian, 1958 edition</ref> A Venetian Column, previously in a fenced courtyard near the Saray,<ref>"Levkosia, the capital of Cyprus" by Archduke Louis Salvator, 1881</ref> was restored on a new site in the summer of 1915 in the middle of Saray Square. The Nicosia column was presumably erected in compliment to the reigning Doge Francesco Donati about the year 1550.<ref name=jeffery/>

Just after the British Occupation a Municipal Council was constituted in Nicosia in 1882 for the general administration of public affairs within the city and for a certain area without the walls, under the presidency of a Mayor.<ref name=jeffery/> The first municipal offices were in Municipality Square (now the central municipal market), but in 1944 the offices were transferred temporarily to the d'Avila bastion and in 1952 this was made permanent with a decision to renovate the building.<ref>[http://www.nicosia.org.cy Municipality web site, section on Municipal Building] retrieved August 2013</ref>

[[File:Nicosia boundary extensions.png|thumb|upright=1.35|left|alt=Extensions to the Nicosia municipal area|Extensions to the Nicosia municipal area]]

[[Nicosia International Airport]] was opened in 1947. It remained the location for the Air Station until its abandonment in 1974.

In 1955 an armed struggle against British rule began aiming to unite the island with Greece, [[Enosis]]. The struggle was led by EOKA, a [[Greek Cypriot]] nationalist military resistance organization,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/cyprus/war.html|title=War and Politics – Cyprus|access-date=12 December 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216001406/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/cyprus/war.html|archive-date=16 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and supported by the vast majority of Greek Cypriots. The unification with Greece failed and instead the independence of Cyprus was declared in 1960.

On 15 July 1974, there was [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|an attempted coup d'état]] led by the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]] to unite the island with [[Greece]].

== Geography ==

===Climate===
Being in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Troodos Mountains]], Nicosia has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh'') due to its low annual precipitation totals and annual temperature range.<ref>[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/World_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.jpg Map]</ref> The city experiences long, hot to sweltering, dry summers, and mild winters, with most of the rainfall occurring in winter. Winter precipitation is occasionally accompanied by [[Ice pellets|sleet]] but rarely by [[snow]]. The accumulation of snow is particularly rare (last events occurred in 1950, 1974, 1997, 2015 and 2022). There is occasionally light [[frost]] during the winter nights. On 4 September 2020, Nicosia recorded a temperature of {{convert|46.2|C|F|abbr=on|sp=us}}, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Cyprus.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 September 2020|title=Ιστορική θερμοκρασιακή καταγραφή - Καταρρίφθηκε το παγκύπριο ρεκόρ των 45.6 βαθμών Κελσίου|url=https://www.kitasweather.com/forecasts/istoriki-thermokrasiaki-katagrafi-katarrifthike-to-pagkiprio-rekor/|website=Kitasweather}}</ref>

[[Ledra Street]] is in the middle of the walled city. The street has historically been the busiest shopping street of the capital and adjacent streets lead to the most lively part of the old city with narrow streets, boutiques, bars and art-cafés. The street today is a historic monument on its own, covering about {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} in length and connects the south and north parts of the old city. During the [[EOKA|EOKA struggle]] that ran from 1955 to 1959, the street acquired the informal nickname ''[[Ledra Street|The Murder Mile]]'' in reference to the frequent targeting of the British colonialists by nationalist fighters along its course.<ref>{{cite news|title=The First Move |date= 27 August 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864100-1,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407234812/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864100-1,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 April 2008 |work=Time Magazine |access-date= 20 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/cyprus/war.html |title=War and Politics-Cyprus |publisher=Britains-smallwars.com |access-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216001406/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/cyprus/war.html |archive-date=16 December 2008 }}</ref> In 1963, during the outbreak of hostilities between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, following the announcement of amendments to the Cypriot Constitution, Turkish Cypriots withdrew to the northern part of Nicosia which became one of the many [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves]] which existed throughout the island. Various streets which ran between the northern and southern part of the city, including Ledra Street, were blockaded. During the Turkish army invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Turkish troops occupied northern Nicosia (as well as the northern part of Cyprus). A buffer zone was established across the island along the ceasefire line to separate the northern Turkish controlled part of the island, and the south. The buffer zone runs through Ledra Street. After many failed attempts on reaching agreement between the two communities, Ledra Street was reopened on 3 April 2008.

[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img09 StJohn the Apostle Church.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. John's Cathedral, Nicosia|St. John's Cathedral]]]]
To the east of Ledra Street, [[Faneromeni Square]] was the centre of Nicosia before 1974. It hosts a number of historical buildings and monuments including Faneromeni Church, Faneromeni School, Faneromeni Library and the Marble Mausoleum. Faneromeni Church, is a church built in 1872 in the stead of another church located at the same site, constructed with the remains of La Cava castle and a convent. There rest the archbishop and the other bishops who were executed by the Ottomans in the Saray Square during the 1821 revolt. The Palace of the Archbishop can be found at [[Archbishop Kyprianos]] Square. Although it seems very old, it is a wonderful imitation of typical Venetian style, built in 1956. Next to the palace is the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. John's Cathedral, Nicosia|St. John's Cathedral]] (1665) with picturesque frescos. The square leads to [[Onasagorou Street]], another busy shopping street in the historical centre.

The walls surrounding the old city have three gates. In The [[Kyrenia Gate]] which was responsible to the transport to the north, and especially [[Kyrenia]], the [[Famagusta Gate]] which was responsible for the transport from [[Famagusta]], [[Larnaca]] and [[Limassol]] and [[Karpasia (town)|Karpasia]], and the [[Paphos Gate]] for transport to the west and especially [[Paphos]]. All three gates are well-preserved,<ref name=kesh2>Keshishian, Kevork K. (1978).

Presently, the main square of the city is [[Eleftheria square|Eleftheria (Freedom) Square]], with the city hall, the post office and the library. The square, which has been redesigned by [[Zaha Hadid Architects]] and was delivered to the public in 2021,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-14 |title=Eleftheria Square / Zaha Hadid Architects |url=https://www.archdaily.com/973570/eleftheria-square-zaha-hadid-architects |access-date=2023-12-06 |website=ArchDaily |language=en-US}}</ref> connects the old city with the new city where one can find the main shopping streets such as the prestigious [[Stasikratous Street]], [[Themistokli Dervi Avenue]] and [[Makariou Avenue, Nicosia|Makariou Avenue]].

[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img10 Archbishops Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Archbishop's Palace]]
Nicosia is also known for its fine museums. The [[Archbishop's Palace, Nicosia|Archbishop's Palace]] contains a [[Byzantine]] museum containing the largest collection of religious icons on the island. [[Leventio Museum|Leventis Municipal Museum]] is the only historical museum of Nicosia and revives the old ways of life in the capital from ancient times up to our days. Other interesting museums include the Folk Art Museum, National Struggle Museum (witnessing the [[EOKA|rebellion against the British administration]] in the 1950s), Cyprus Ethnological Museum (House of Dragoman Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios, 18th century) and the Handicrafts centre.

Nicosia also hosts an [[Armenian Diocese of Cyprus|Armenian archbishopric]], a small Buddhist temple, a [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Cyprus|Maronite archbishopric]], and a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church.

==Politics and administration==

===Governance of the metropolitan area===
[[File:Nicosia conurbation map.png|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Map of Greater Nicosia|Greater Nicosia]]Greater Nicosia is administered by several municipalities. In the centre is the city municipality of Nicosia itself (see below). Other municipalities are [[Strovolos]], [[Lakatamia]], [[Latsia]], [[Aglandjia]], [[Engomi]], [[Agios Dhometios]] and the newly formed ({{As of|2011|lc=y}}) [[Yeri, Cyprus|Yeri]] & [[Tseri]].

The population of the conurbation is 300,000 (2011 census, plus Turkish Cypriot administered census of 2006) of which 100,000 live within the Nicosia municipal area. Because Nicosia municipality has separate communal municipal administrations, the population of Strovolos (67,904 (2011 Census)) is actually the largest of all the local authorities in Greater Nicosia.

Within Nicosia municipality, most of the population resides in the more recently annexed outlying areas of [[Kaimakli]], [[Pallouriotissa]], [[Omorfita]] and [[Ayioi Omoloyites, Nicosia|Ayii Omoloyites]].

There is no metropolitan authority as such for Greater Nicosia and various roles, responsibilities and functions for the wider area are undertaken by the Nicosia District administration, bodies such as the Nicosia Water Board and, to some extent, Nicosia municipality.

The Nicosia Water Board supplies water to the following municipalities: Nicosia, Strovolos, Aglandjia, Engomi, Ay. Dometios, Latsia, Geri and Tseri. The board consists of three persons nominated by the Council of each municipality, plus three members appointed by the government, who are usually the District Officer of Nicosia District, who chairs the Board, the Accountant General and the Director of the Water Department. The board also supply Anthoupolis and Ergates, for whom the government provide representatives. Thus the board is in the majority controlled by the municipalities of Greater Nicosia in providing this vital local government service.<ref>[http://www.wbn.org.cy Official web site of the Nicosia Water Board] (extract 20 May 2013)</ref>

The Nicosia Sewerage Board, is likewise majority controlled by the municipalities of Greater Nicosia. It is chaired ''ex officio'' by the Mayor of Nicosia and consists of members chosen by the municipalities of Nicosia (6 members), Strovolos (5 members),
Aglandjia (2 members),
Lakatamia (2 members),
Ay. Dometios (2 members),
Engomi (2 members),
Latsia (1 member).
The sewage treatment plant is at [[Mia Milia]]. The Nicosia Sewerage System serves a population of approximately 140,000 and an area of {{convert|20|km2|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Approximately 30% of the influent is contributed by the Turkish Cypriot Side.<ref>[http://www.sbn.org.cy Official web site of the Nicosia Sewerage Board] (extract 20 May 2013)</ref>

Public transport is not controlled by the local authorities, but comes under the Nicosia District administration, which is an arm of the Ministry of the Interior. Transport services (primarily bus and taxi) are provided by private operators such as OSEL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.osel.com.cy/ |title=Official web site of Organization for Communications of Nicosia District |access-date=23 September 2011 |archive-date=6 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606042432/http://www.osel.com.cy/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> In late 2019 the contract for providing transport services in the district of Nicosia was awarded via tender to a private consortium which was expected to take over the system on 5 July 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/nicosia-bus-services-in-the-hands-of-kapnos-consortium/|title=Nicosia bus services in the hands of Kapnos consortium|website=in-cyprus.philenews.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politis.com.cy/politis-news/kypros/leoforeia-leykosias-ypografike-i-symvasi/|title=Λεωφορεία Λευκωσίας: Υπογράφηκε η σύμβαση|date=24 January 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img18 View from Shacolas Tower.jpg|thumb|Holy Cross Church]]
Historically Nicosia is a melting pot harmonizing multiple religious establishments, denominations, churches, mosques, synagogues, etc.
Traditionally Nicosia hosts Greek Orthodox churches, Armenian Apostolic churches, Latin Catholic, Maronite Catholic, Anglican churches, Evangelical churches as well as mosques and synagogues.

==== Armenian Apostolic Church ====
[[File:Sourp Asdvadzadzin-front.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Armenian Apostolic Church in Nicosia]]
One of the oldest Armenian churches known as the Benedictine Abbey of Our Lady of Tyre, was founded in the 13th century as a principal convent following the fall of Jerusalem. In 1308, the Lusignan king, [[Henry II of Jerusalem]], repaired the church after it was destroyed by an earthquake. As many of the nuns were Armenian in origin, it came under the Armenian Church before 1504.<ref name="Hadjilyras-1">{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19540738/The-Armenians-of-Cyprus-booklet|title=The Armenians of Cyprus (Booklet) |via=Scribd |last=Hadjilyra|first=Alexander-Michael|date=May 2009|publisher=Kalaydjian Foundation|access-date=16 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103031242/https://www.scribd.com/doc/19540738/The-Armenians-of-Cyprus-booklet |archive-date= Nov 3, 2012 }}</ref>
Since 1963, the church has been located in [[North Nicosia]], under Turkish Cypriot administration.

With the help of the World Council of Churches, the Church of Westphalia, the Cyprus government and the faithful, a new church was built in Strovolos, also called "Sourp Asdvadzadzin". Its foundation stone was laid on 25 September 1976 by Archbishop Makarios III and Archbishop Nerses Pakhdigian. It was officially inaugurated on 22 November 1981 by Catholicos of Cilicia Khoren I and Coadjutor Catholicos of Cilicia Karekin II, in the presence of Archbishop Chrysostomos I, Bishop Zareh Aznavorian and Representative Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian.

==== Maronite Catholic Church ====
[[File:Nicosia by Paride 11.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Maronite Church in Nicosia]]
The Maronite community is a traditional community in Nicosia. The archeparchy extends its jurisdiction over all the faithful Maronites of the island of Cyprus. Its arcieparchial seat is the city of Nicosia, where is located the [[Our Lady of Grace Cathedral (Nicosia)]].

The archeparchy at the end of 2013 out of a population of 838,897 people had 10,400 baptized, corresponding to 1.2% of the total. Its territory is divided into 12 parishes.
''Our Lady of Grace Cathedral'' is the main Maronite church of the city of Nicosia, in Cyprus, and is the cathedral of the [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Cyprus]].

The first cathedral was dedicated to St. John, but during the Ottoman occupation it was turned into a mosque. The Lebanese Maronite community erected the church of Santa Croce, later entrusted to the Franciscans, and the current church of Our Lady of Grace is near to the Franciscan church. In 1960, the seat of the vicarage and the surrounding buildings were built.<ref>{{cite web |date=2012-06-03 |url=http://www.cyprushighlights.com/en/index.php/2012/06/03/cathedral-church-of-our-lady-of-graces/ |title=Cathedral Church of Our Lady of Graces (within the walls) Nicosia |access-date=2016-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212147/http://www.cyprushighlights.com/en/index.php/2012/06/03/cathedral-church-of-our-lady-of-graces/ |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
On 6 June 2010 [[Pope Benedict XVI]], the first pope to make an apostolic trip to the island, visited the cathedral of Nicosia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2010/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20100606_catt-maronita.html|title=Apostolic Journey to Cyprus - Visit at the Cathedral of the Maronite Church of Cyprus (Nicosia, 6 June 2010) &#124; BENEDICT XVI |website=www.vatican.va}}</ref>

==== Anglican Church ====
[[File:St-Pauls-Cathedral-Nicosia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Anglican Church in Nicosia]]
The church of St. Paul was built in 1893 when Cyprus was a protectorate of the British Empire. The influence of politics on architecture is evident by the structural elements of the building, which is reminiscent of an English parish church. The Christian church today is part of the Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf.

==== Greek Evangelical Church ====
[[File:Greek Evangelical Church Nicosia.jpg|thumb|right|Greek Evangelical Church of Nicosia]]
The Greek Evangelical Church of Nicosia is a relatively modern architecture serving the local Protestant community. Along with special hours dedicated to services of the Greek Evangelical community, it serves as a worship centre of local Protestants of other nationalities, such as Armenian, American, Romanian, Korean, Chinese, etc. It is located on Gladstone Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cyprushighlights.com/en/2012/11/12/greek-evangelical-church-in-nicosia/|title = Greek Evangelical Church in Nicosia|date = 12 November 2012}}</ref>

==== Armenian Evangelical Church ====
[[File:Nicosia Armenian Evangelical.jpg|thumb|left|Armenian Evangelical Church of Nicosia]]
The first [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] in Cyprus came after the arrival of the [[United Kingdom|British]] in July 1878. As they were not committed, and very few in number, they quickly became associated with the ''Mother Church'' ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]), such as Apisoghom Utidjian, the official state documents translator and the son of Stepan Utidjian, one of the original founders of the [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], who served as chairman of the Nicosia parish council for 30 years. With the influx of more [[Protestants]], [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] became affiliated with the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]] as early as 1887. Although the main centres were Nicosia and [[Larnaca]], gatherings were occasionally held in [[Limassol]], [[Famagusta]], and [[Pano Amiantos|Amiandos]].

There was also a small Armenian Evangelical church, located on Mahmoud Pasha Street, in the Turkish-occupied part of the walled city of Nicosia—behind the old American Academy building, near the [[Arabahmet Mosque|Arab Ahmed mosque]]. Prior to its erection, [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] used to worship God at the Reformed Presbyterian Church on Apostolos Varnavas Street, opposite the old Powerhouse and behind the building of the Holy Archbishopric of Cyprus. The church - a vision already since the early 1930s - was eventually built thanks to the initiative of pastor Yohanna Der Megerditchian, with the financial contribution of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]] and the Armenian Evangelical faithful; its architect was Dickran H. Davidian. Its foundation stone was laid on 28 July 1946 by pastor Yohanna Der Megerditchian, who dedicated it on 1 July 1947. On the lower part of the right wall to the side of the entrance, there is an inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

==== Converted cathedral ====
[[File:Nicosia church.jpg|thumb|[[Selimiye Mosque, Nicosia|Selimiye Mosque]], converted from a cathedral as the right of conquest]]
Perhaps the most iconic religious architecture of Nicosia is the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, also known as the Agia Sophia of Nicosia, which was constructed in the year of 1326 as a Catholic church.  It was converted into a [[mosque]] and it is located in [[North Nicosia]]. It has historically been the main mosque of the city. As a mosque it is known as the Selimiye Mosque which is housed in the largest and oldest surviving [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] church in [[Cyprus]] (interior dimensions: {{convert|66|x|21|m|ft|abbr=in|disp=or|sp=us}}) possibly constructed on the site of an earlier [[Byzantine]] church.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitcyprus.com/index.php/en/discovercyprus/culture-religion/sites-monuments/item/207-st-paul-s-anglican-church |title=St. Paul's Anglican Church |website=www.visitcyprus.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905061649/http://www.visitcyprus.com/index.php/en/discovercyprus/culture-religion/sites-monuments/item/207-st-paul-s-anglican-church |archive-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>
During the 50-day [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)|siege of the city in 1570]], the cathedral provided refuge for a great number of people. When the city fell on 9 September, Francesco Contarini, the Bishop of Paphos, delivered the last Christian sermon in the building, in which he asked for divine help and exhorted the people. The cathedral was stormed by Ottoman soldiers, who broke the door and killed the bishop along with others. They smashed or threw out Christian items, such as furniture and ornaments in the cathedral<ref name=kesh>Keshishian, Kevork K. (1978). ''Nicosia: Capital of Cyprus Then and Now'', p. 104, The Mouflon Book and Art Centre.</ref> and destroyed the choir as well as the nave.<ref name=gurkan>{{cite book|last1=Gürkan|first1=Haşmet Muzaffer|title=Dünkü ve Bugünkü Lefkoşa|year=2006|publisher=Galeri Kültür|isbn=9963660037|pages=117–8|edition=3rd|language=Turkish}}</ref> Then, they washed the interior of the mosque to make it ready for the first [[Friday prayer]] that it would host on 15 September, which was attended by the commander [[Lala Mustafa Pasha]] and saw the official conversion of the cathedral into a mosque.<ref name=kesh/> According to [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the main temple of a city conquered by Muslims and not surrendered in peace may be converted to a mosque as a symbol of the takeover and superiority of Islam.

Following its conversion, the mosque became the property of the Sultan Selim Foundation, which was responsible for maintaining it. Other donors formed a number of foundations to help with the maintenance.{{sfn|Bağışkan|2013}} Okçuzade Mehmed Paşa, a governor of Cyprus in the 16th century, donated a shop to provide income for the Sultan Selim Foundation; other donations include estates in the countryside and other shops.

[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img13 Omeriye Mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Omeriye Mosque in Nicosia]]
Historically Nicosia (south and north) hosts over 15 mosques, either originally constructed as such or converted from a church.
The Ömeriye Mosque, formerly known as the Augustinian Church of Saint Mary is a mosque in the walled city of Nicosia on the island of [[Cyprus]], currently located in the south section of Nicosia.<ref name="TDV"/> Following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], the mosque gained significance as one of the most important sites of Muslim worship in the non-Muslim section of the island and the city.<ref name="TDV">{{cite journal|last1=Çiçek|first1=Kemal|title=LEFKOŞE, published by Türk Diyanet Vakfı(Turkish Religious Affairs Association), Location: Gazimağusa, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|journal=İslam Ansiklopedisi (Encyclopedia of Islam)|date=1997|volume=27|page=126|url=http://www.tdvia.org/dia/ayrmetin.php?idno=270126|access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref>
