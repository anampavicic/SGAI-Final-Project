'''Johor Bahru''' ({{IPA|zsm|ˈdʒohor ˈbahru|lang}}), colloquially referred to as '''JB''', is the capital city of the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] of [[Johor]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[core city]] of [[Johor Bahru District]], the second-largest district in the country, by population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=DOSM: Petaling district has highest population, density in 2023 |url=https://www.thesundaily.my/local/dosm-petaling-district-has-highest-population-density-in-2023-GG11426671 |access-date=2023-10-25 |website=www.thesundaily.my |language=en-MY}}</ref> It is the second-largest national [[GDP]]-contributor among the major cities in Malaysia,<ref>{{Cite journal |date=November 2015 |title=Achieving A System of Competitive Cities in Malaysia: Main Report |url=https://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/709061475743434007/pdf/102222-v1-REVISED-PUBLIC-Malaysia-Competitive-Cities-Main-Report-low-res-final.pdf |journal=World Bank Group & Khazanah Nasional}}</ref> and forms a part of [[Iskandar Malaysia]], the nation's largest [[special economic zone]], by investment value.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lee |first=Shaun |date=14 January 2019 |title=An international metropolis 13 years in the making |url=https://lot.dhl.com/an-international-metropolis-13-years-in-the-making/ |access-date=2023-10-27 |website=DHL Logistics of Things |language=en}}</ref> The city has a population of 858,118 people within an area of 391.25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

As the financial centre and logistics hub of southern [[Peninsular Malaysia]], Johor Bahru has been ranked the second-most competitive city in the nation behind the capital, [[Kuala Lumpur]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ni Pengfei，Marco Kamiya, Guo Jing, Zhang Yi, etc |title=Global Urban Competitiveness Report (2020–2021) |url=https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2021/11/1_report_on_competitiveness_of_cities_worldwide2020-2021.pdf |journal=United Nations Human Settlements Programme}}</ref> Geographically, it is located at the southern end of the [[Malay Peninsula]], along the north bank of the [[Straits of Johor]], north of the [[city-state]] [[metropolis]] of [[Singapore]], specifically [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]]. Johor Bahru serves as one of two international border crossings, on the Malaysian side, between the country and Singapore, making it the [[Border checkpoint#Land|busiest international border crossing in the world]]; its direct land link to Singapore, via the [[Johor–Singapore Causeway|JB-Woodlands Causeway]] (the other being the [[Malaysia–Singapore Second Link|(Tuas) Second Link]] at [[Iskandar Puteri]]), [[KTM Intercity]] (''Shuttle Tebrau'') and the future [[Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System|RTS Link]] (under construction), is a key economic driver of the [[Border town|border city]]. Johor Bahru is categorised as Zone A of [[Iskandar Malaysia]], adjacent to [[Senai International Airport]] and the 16th-busiest port in the world, [[Port of Tanjung Pelepas|Tanjung Pelepas]].

During the reign of [[Sultan]] [[Abu Bakar of Johor|Abu Bakar]] (between 1886–1895), there was further development and modernisation within the city, with the construction of administrative centres, offices, schools, civic and religious buildings, and railways connecting to [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] in [[North Region, Singapore|Northern Singapore]]. Along with most of Southeast Asia, Japanese forces [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|occupied]] Johor Bahru from 1942 to 1945 during the [[Pacific War]]. Johor Bahru thus became the post-war cradle of [[Early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalism]], and a major political party (known as the [[United Malays National Organisation]], or UMNO) was founded at the [[Istana Besar]] of Johor Bahru in 1946. After the [[Malaysian Independence Day parade|formation of modern Malaysia]] in 1963, Johor Bahru retained its status as state capital, and was eventually granted city status, in 1994.

==Etymology==
The present area of Johor Bahru was originally known as ''Tanjung Puteri'', and was a fishing village of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]. [[Temenggong]] [[Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim|Daeng Ibrahim]] then renamed ''Tanjung Puteri'' to ''Iskandar Puteri'' upon his arrival to the area in 1858, after acquiring the territory from [[Ali Iskandar of Johor|Sultan Ali]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Zainol Abidin Idid (Syed.)|title=Pemeliharaan warisan rupa bandar: panduan mengenali warisan rupa bandar berasaskan inventori bangunan warisan Malaysia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AePVAAAAMAAJ|language=ms|publisher=Badan Warisan Malaysia|isbn=978-983-99554-1-5|date=}}</ref> It was renamed to Johor Bahru by [[Abu Bakar of Johor|Sultan Abu Bakar]] following the Temenggong's death.<ref name="jb history">{{cite web |date=12 March 2013 |title=Background of Johor Bahru City Council and History of Johor Bahru |url=http://myrepositori.pnm.gov.my/bitstream/123456789/752/3/Majlis%20Bandaraya%20Johor%20Bahru%20%5BSumber%20Internet%5D.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627001833/http://myrepositori.pnm.gov.my/bitstream/123456789/752/3/Majlis%20Bandaraya%20Johor%20Bahru%20%5BSumber%20Internet%5D.pdf |archive-date=27 June 2015 |access-date=27 June 2015 |publisher=Malaysian Digital Repository}}</ref> The word "Bah(a)ru" means "new" in Malay; thus, Johor Bahru  means "New Johor". ''Bahru'' is normally written as "baru" in English ([[Latin script|Roman]]) characters, today, although the word appears in other place names with several English spelling variants, such as in [[Kota Bharu]], Kelantan, and  [[Pekanbaru]], [[Riau]] ([[Indonesia]]).

Johor Bahru was once known as ''Shantou'', or "Little Swatow", by the city's [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese community]], as most of the Chinese residents are [[Teochew people|Teochew]] whose ancestry can be traced back to [[Shantou]], China; they arrived in the mid-19th century, during the reign of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim.<ref name="teochew">{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20100724-228663.html|title=Keeping the art of Teochew opera alive|work=[[New Straits Times]]|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|date=24 July 2010|access-date=24 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724135919/http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20100724-228663.html|archive-date=24 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city, however, is generally known in Chinese as ''Xinshan'', meaning "New Mountain" ({{zh |c=新山|p= Xīnshān}}), as "mountain" may be used to mean "territory" or "land".<ref>{{cite book|title=Decoding Sejarah Melayu: The Hidden History of Ancient Singapore|first=Jason|last= Heng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_X0wEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT127|year=2021|publisher=Jason Heng |isbn=9798201638450}}</ref> The name "New Mountain" distinguished it from "Old Mountain" (''Jiushan''), once used to refer to [[Kranji]] and [[Sembawang]] (in Singapore), where the Chinese first cultivated [[black pepper]] and [[Uncaria gambir|gambier]] on plantations before relocating to new lands in Johor Bahru in 1855.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder, and Entrepreneur|author=Patricia Pui Huen Lim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5BuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA35|year= 2002|page=35 |publisher=Times Editions |isbn=9789812323699}}</ref>

Due to a dispute between the Malays and the [[Bugis people|Bugis]], the Johor-Riau Sultanate was split in 1819 with the mainland portion of the [[Johor Sultanate]] coming under the control of [[Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim]] while the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]] came under the control of the Bugis.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald B.

There are two monsoon periods each year, the first one between mid-October and January, which is the north-east Monsoon. This period is characterised by heavier rainfall and wind from the north-east. The second one is the south-west Monsoon, which hardly affects the rainfall in Johor Bahru, where winds are from the south and south-west. This occurs between June and September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/malaysia|date=25 February 2019|title=Malaysia|website=Climates To Travel|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>
