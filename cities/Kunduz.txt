'''Kunduz''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ʊ|n|d|uː|z}}; {{langx|ps|قندوز}}; {{langx|fa|قندوز}}) is a city in northern [[Afghanistan]] and the capital of [[Kunduz Province]]. The city has an estimated population of about 268,893 as of 2015, making it about the [[List of cities in Afghanistan|seventh largest city]] of Afghanistan, and the largest city in northeastern Afghanistan.<ref name="soac1">{{cite web|date=2015|title=State of Afghan Cities report 2015 (Volume-I English)|url=https://unhabitat.org/soac2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026042513/https://unhabitat.org/soac2015|archive-date=2021-10-26|access-date=2021-10-26|publisher=[[UN-Habitat]]|language=en}}</ref> Kunduz is in the historical [[Tokharistan]] region of [[Bactria]], near the confluence of the [[Kunduz River]] with the [[Khanabad River]]. Kunduz is linked by highways with [[Kabul]] to the south, [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] to the west, and [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]] to the east. Kunduz is also linked with [[Dushanbe]] in [[Tajikistan]] to the north, via the Afghan [[dry port]] of [[Sherkhan Bandar]]. This city is famous in Afghanistan for its watermelon production.

As of 2015, the land use of the city (within the municipal boundary) is largely agricultural (65.8% of total area). Residential land comprises nearly half of the 'built-up' land area (48.3%) with 29,877 dwellings. Institutional land comprises 17.9% of built-up land use, given that the airport is within the municipal boundary.<ref name="soac2">{{cite web|date=2015|title=State of Afghan Cities report 2015 (Volume-II)|url=https://unhabitat.org/soac2015_volume2|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026042608/https://unhabitat.org/soac2015_volume2|archive-date=2021-10-26|access-date=2021-10-26 |publisher=[[UN-Habitat]]|language=en, prs}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Kunduz is also sometimes spelled ([[romanized]]) as '''Kundûz''', '''Qonduz''', '''Qondûz''', '''Konduz''', '''Kondûz''', '''Kondoz''', or '''Qhunduz'''. The name of the city is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] compound, ''kohan dež'', "old/ancient fort".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Branch|first=India Army General Staff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPVtAAAAMAAJ|title=Historical and Political Gazetteer of Afghanistan|date=1972|publisher=Akadem.

== History ==
{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}
Kunduz is the site of the ancient city of '''Drapsaka'''. It was a great centre of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] learning and very prosperous during the 3rd century AD.

The city used to be called [[Aornos]] ({{Langx|xbc|οαρνο|translit=warn}})<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sims-Williams |title=New Light on Ancient Afghanistan |pages=16–17}}</ref> and later '''Walwalij'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/voror/Personal/Islamic_Numismatics.html|title=Asien-Afrika-Institut|work=uni-hamburg.de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204821/http://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/voror/Personal/Islamic_Numismatics.html|archive-date=2012-05-09}}</ref> or '''Varvaliz''', a compound of the old name Warn and {{Langx|xbc|λιζο|lit=fortress|translit=liz}}'''.'''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gholami |first=Saloumeh |title=Selected Features of Bactrian Grammar |pages=80}}</ref> The name ''Kuhandiz'' began to be used from the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] time.

In the 18th and 19th centuries it was the capital of an [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[Kunduz Khanate|khanate]] which reached its largest extent, from [[Balkh]] to the [[Pamir Mountains]], during the reign of [[Mohammad Murad Beg|Murad Beg]] (1815–1842). Murad Beg faced the decline of his state [[Afghan Turkestan Campaign (1838–39)|after being defeated]] by [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Noelle-Karimi |first=Christine |url=http://archive.org/details/state-and-tribe-in-nineteenth-century-afghanistan-the-reign-of-amir-dost-muhamma |title=State And Tribe In Nineteenth Century Afghanistan: The Reign Of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan (1826-1863) |publication-date=1997 |pages=84}}</ref> After Murad's death, the khanate declined and was eventually [[Afghan Conquest of Kunduz|subjugated by Afghanistan]] in 1859.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Noelle-Karimi |first=Christine |url=http://archive.org/details/state-and-tribe-in-nineteenth-century-afghanistan-the-reign-of-amir-dost-muhamma |title=State And Tribe In Nineteenth Century Afghanistan: The Reign Of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan (1826-1863) |publication-date=1997 |pages=88}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, between 100 and 200,000 Tajiks and Uzbeks fled the conquest of their homeland by the Russian Red Army and settled in northern Afghanistan.<ref name="Afghanistan Analysts Network">{{cite web|url=http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/fachpublikationen/wrm_2012_the_networks_of_Kunduz.pdf|title=The Networks of Kunduz: A History of Conflict and Their Actors, from 1992 to 2001|last=Wörmer|first=Nils|date=2012|website=Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik|publisher=[[Afghanistan Analysts Network]]|page=8|access-date=2014-01-12}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, under the governance of [[Sher Khan Nashir]], Kunduz became one of the wealthiest Afghan provinces. This was mainly due to Nasher's founding of the Spinzar Cotton Company, which continues to exist in post-war Afghanistan. At its peak, the Spinzar Cotton Company employed 5,000 people full time. Kunduz is the most important agricultural province which produces [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[millet]], and other products and obtained the nickname of "the hive of the country."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-02-08 |title=Afghanistan's Misguided Economy {{!}} Boston Review |url=https://bostonreview.net/world/graciana-del-castillo-afghanistans-misguided-economy |access-date=2023-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208005722/https://bostonreview.net/world/graciana-del-castillo-afghanistans-misguided-economy |archive-date=8 February 2014 }}</ref>

===21st century===
Kunduz is the centre for the northeast provinces and was captured by the [[Taliban]] in 1997. It was the last major city held by the Taliban before its fall to US-backed [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] forces on 26 November 2001.[[File:Kunduz.JPG|220x220px|thumb|left|Countryside in Kunduz, 2005]]During the summer of 2015, the Taliban advanced and attacked the city, which resulted in a [[Battle of Kunduz (2015)|battle for control of the city]] against Afghan forces.

The [[Afghan Armed Forces]] counter-attacked and managed to re-capture the city in 15 days. The Taliban announced that, after achieving their objectives, they have withdrawn from the city's center. [[Zabiullah Mujahid]], a Taliban spokesperson, said that their main object in leaving the city is to avoid civilian casualties from air raids.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34520318|title=Taliban admit Kunduz withdrawal|date=13 October 2015|access-date=8 April 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In April 2018 the Afghan Air Force conducted [[Kunduz Madrassah Attack|an airstrike]] that killed and injured dozens of civilians at a [[madrasa|religious school]] in Kunduz.<ref>{{cite web|date=3 April 2018|author=cbs/AFP|title=Carnage as airstrike hits boy's[sic] school in Taliban territory|website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=2018-04-13|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-airstrike-kunduz-dashte-archi-district-kabul-says-taliban-hit/}}</ref> On 31 August 2019, the Taliban forces launched another attack on the city, setting off a major battle with local security forces.
