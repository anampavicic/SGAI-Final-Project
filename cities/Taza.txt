'''Taza''' ({{langx|ar|تازة}}) is a city in northern [[Morocco]] occupying the corridor between the [[Rif]] mountains and [[Middle Atlas]] mountains, about 120&nbsp;km east of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and 150&nbsp;km south of [[Al Hoceima]]. It recorded a population of 148,406 in the 2019 [[Moroccan census]]<ref name=census2014/> and is the capital of [[Taza Province]].

==History==
Historically Taza was known first as ''Ribāt Taza'' ({{Langx|ar|رباط تازة|links=no}}), a military camp belonging to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid state]], founded by the local governor [[Musa ibn Abi'l-Afiya]] ({{Lang|ar|موسى بن أبي العافية}}) who was also the leader of the [[Miknasa]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of the Arabs and the Berbers and Their Powerful Contemporaries by Ibn Khaldūn (تاريخ ابن خلدون)}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=November 2022}} Up to at least the early 20th century, Taza was a considerable trading centre on the route between Fez and the [[Algeria]]n frontier.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Morocco |volume=18 |page=854 |first1=James |last1=Meakin |first2=Kate |last2=Meakin}}</ref> Taza as a [[toponym]] could be derivative from Tizi (Tamazight for a hill that lies between mountains) which is where it stands up.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}}

Taza was first settled by [[Miknasa]] tribesmen, who gave it its name: ''Miknasa Taza'', similar to ''Miknasa al-Zeitoun'' (present-day [[Meknes]], another Miknasa settlement). The [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] empire took over Taza in 1074. They were replaced by the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] empire in 1132. In 1248 the city was captured by the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]]. Although Taza barred the route of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] from [[Algiers]] seeking conquest in what is now [[Morocco]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Taza|title=Taza {{!}} Morocco|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}</ref> it fell to the [[French colonial empire|French]] in 1914. The old town has Berber monuments, [[mosque]]s, and a 14th-century [[madrasa]] ([[Koran]]ic school). Population in 1982 stood at 77,216.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}}

==Geography==
Taza is located in north-central Morocco, in the south of the [[Rif]] region right outside the mountain range on a narrow plain. The city is composed of two formerly separate towns built on separate terraces overlooking a mountain valley. The old-Taza town is at an elevation of 1,919 feet (585 m) above sea level and is surrounded by fortifications; the newer town, established by the French in 1920, is located in a fertile plain at an elevation of 1,460 feet (445 m). [[Fossil]] remains indicate that caves in the area were inhabited as early as the [[Paleolithic Period]]. One of the most important caves in Morocco, [[Rhar Chara]], is close to Taza. This cave is over 7.6 kilometres long.<ref name=gunn>{{cite book|editor-last=Gunn|editor-first=John|title=Encyclopedia of caves and karst science|year=2003|publisher=Dearborn|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=1579583997|page=26}}</ref>

The city is located in a mountain pass known as the "Taza Gap", where the Rif mountains and the Middle-Atlas range come together. Through this pass successive waves of invaders moved westward onto the Atlantic coastal plains of north-western Africa.

===Climate===

The [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean]] (Csa).<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web|title=Climate: Taza تازة - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/763640/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|access-date=28 August 2013}}</ref> Located along the Atlas Mountains, Taza has a seasonal climate, shifting from cool in winter to hot days in summer. Rainfall can reach up to 900&nbsp;mm per year. The highest temperature ever registered in Taza was {{convert|46.4|°C}}, on July 23, 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?ind=60127&ano=2021&mes=7&day=24&hora=6&min=0&ndays=30 |title=60127: Taza (Morocco) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 23 July 2021|website=ogimet.com |publisher=[[OGIMET]] |access-date= 24 July 2021|quote=}}</ref>

==Sights==
The city's most famous historic monument is the [[Great Mosque of Taza]], an important piece of [[Moroccan architecture]] from the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] and [[Marinid Sultanate|Marinid]] periods.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Terrasse|first=Henri|title=La grande mosquée de Taza|publisher=Les Éditions d'art et d'histoire|year=1943|location=Paris}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Bloom|first=Jonathan M.|title=Architecture of the Islamic West: North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, 700-1800|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2020|isbn=9780300218701|pages=121–123, 182–184}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{Cite book|last=Marçais|first=Georges|title=L'architecture musulmane d'Occident|publisher=Arts et métiers graphiques|year=1954|location=Paris|pages=201, 271}}</ref> The old town's main thoroughfare is enlivened by the Grain Market and the [[Souk]]s where wickerwork, tapestries, jewellery and other goods are sold. The road terminates at a square doubling as a parade ground which sports the Al-Andalous Mosque. The Mosque's minaret, constructed in the 14th century, is wider at the top than at its base.

Bab el-Qebbour Street crosses the Kissaria (covered marketplace), then leads on to the Market Mosque where it meets up with Bab Jamaa gate, the main point of entry of Taza. Somewhat further south, across from Bab el-Rih, the Wind Gate, a bastion dating from the 16th century closes the ring around the [[kasbah]]. Taza's city walls, raised in the 12th century and frequently enlarged on later occasions were equipped with a Borj or fortified tower 26 metres (85&nbsp;ft) wide at the base by the [[Saadi Sultanate|Saadian]] sultan [[Ahmad I al-Mansur Saadi|Ahmed el-Mansour]] in the 16th century. The gate with an iron grate and the [[casemate]]s with terraced roofs are clearly influenced by European military architecture.

==Topology==
The topology of the area has imposed a pattern of urban spread. Viewed from above, the city takes the form of a "T". It has its root in Taza high and stretches north to reach the bed of the Oued Larbaâ. Since the urban stretches east and west along the N6 between Fez and Oujda.

At the dawn of independence, the city consisted of the [[Medina of Taza|Medina High Taza]], the European district occupying a hill called "No Adrar Illouz. People usually pronounce Draâ louz. This area became the center of town, and finally the station area a few kilometers below.

During the following years (60s, 70s) districts have emerged, midway between downtown and the train station (Bit Goulem, Ourida, Bin-Jradi).

During the 80s, other districts make their appearance, especially north of the city (and Massira Al-Quds), extended and developed areas today. The goal of this extension was the [[slum clearance]]. It was a success, since 1986 the city was declared a city without slums. The craze is such that sections like (Massira II) are villa style.

The 90s marked the beginning of the urbanization of the axis center - Taza above. These are buildings with 6 or 7 floors occupying a strategic content between public facilities (municipality, space, civil protection, hospital ibn baja, high school and college ...) and on the other hand, it is down the high rock a hundred yards. This area is also adjacent to the uptown-Qessou meddah, Friouato and Hay Shuhada (developed throughout the last three decades).

More recently this area continues to morph and promises a beautiful view from the heights of the city. The planning now also spread on the road to Fez for several kilometers to reach the intermittently R508 (about Tainast).

The development plan provides a direct link between Taza West (at the "white bridge") and Taza high.
