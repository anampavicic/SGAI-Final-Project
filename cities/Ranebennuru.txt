===Fauna===
Ranebennuru is home to a wildlife sanctuary. [[Ranibennur Blackbuck Sanctuary]] is home to [[blackbuck]], [[Great Indian Bustard]] and wolves. Great Indian Bustard was last spotted in 2005 and maybe locally extinct.

==Demographics==
{{As of|2011}} India [[census]], Ranebennur has a population of 106,365. Males constitute 50.7% of the population and females 49.3%. Ranebennur has a literacy rate of 60.98%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. Male literacy is 60.16% and female literacy is 61.8%. In Ranebennur, 10.8% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==Economy==
The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture and related activities. Cotton and jowar ([[sorghum]]) are very well suited to the semi-arid climate. Coconut, [[brinjal]], maize, betel leaves, and tomatoes are the other crops grown here both as produce and for their seeds. Much of the agricultural output is dependent on the [[southwest monsoon]] and hence gets challenging at times. the [[Tunga River|Upper Tunga]] project, if completed, will be a boon for the farmers in this region.<ref>http://waterresources.kar.nic.in/salient_features_uppertunga.htm {{Dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref> [[Sericulture]] (rearing of [[silkworms]]) is growing in popularity among the farmers. [[Mulberry]] plants are grown and silkworm larvae are fed cut-up mulberry leaves. This is a labour-intensive activity and hence well suited to this region.

Ranebennur is home to a rich commodity market. Commodities like cotton yarn, [[cottonseed]], [[oilseeds]], red chilli, [[betel nut]], and [[betel leaf]] are traded. Ranebennur has a seed multiplication industry. Several seed companies are located and operating in the city. Ranebennur is also known for its wholesale cloth market and all type of wholesale business.
