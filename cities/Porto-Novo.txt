Situated on an inlet of the [[Gulf of Guinea]], in the southeastern portion of the country, the city was originally developed as a port for the [[Transatlantic Slave Trade|transatlantic]] [[History of slavery|slave trade]] led by the [[Portuguese Empire]]. It is Benin's second-largest city, and although it is the official capital, where the national legislature sits, the larger city of [[Cotonou]] is the [[seat of government]], where most of the government buildings are situated and government departments operate.

==Etymology==
The name ''Porto-Novo'' is of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] origin, literally meaning "New Port". It remains untranslated in French, the [[national language]] of Benin.

==History==
{{see also|List of rulers of Hogbonu (Porto-Novo)}}
Porto-Novo was once a tributary of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] kingdom of [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]],<ref name=beninguide>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=op5eAvnZfG0C&q=Porto+Novo+Yoruba+Kingdom+Oyo&pg=PA111|title=Benin (Other Places Travel Guide)|author=Erica Kraus|author2=Felicie Reid|page=111|publisher=Other Places Publishing|isbn=978-0-982-2619-10|access-date=March 9, 2015|year=2010|archive-date=April 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407175811/https://books.google.com/books?id=op5eAvnZfG0C&q=Porto+Novo+Yoruba+Kingdom+Oyo&pg=PA111|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yGPTsRubWEC&q=Porto+Novo+Hogbonou+Yoruba+History+Oyo&pg=PA297|title=Historical Dictionary of Benin (African Historical Dictionaries)|page=297|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2013|author=Mathurin C.

The Yoruba community in Porto-Novo today remains one of the two ethnicities aboriginal to the city. The city was originally called ''Ajashe'' (Àjàṣẹ́ in Yoruba orthography) by the Yorubas, and ''Hogbonu'' by the [[Gun people|Gun]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Although historically the original inhabitants of the area were [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] speaking, there seems to have been a wave of migration from the region of [[Allada]] further west in the 1600s, which brought Te-Agbalin (or Te Agdanlin) and his group to the region of Ajashe in 1688.<ref name="Bradt"/> {{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

In 1730, the Portuguese Eucaristo de Campos named the city "Porto-Novo" because of its resemblance to the city of [[Porto]].<ref>Mathurin C. Houngnikpo, Samuel Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Benin'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2013, p. 297</ref><ref>Britannica,

In 1861, the [[United Kingdom|British]], who were active in nearby [[Nigeria]], bombarded the city, which persuaded the Kingdom of Porto-Novo to accept [[France|French]] protection in 1863.<ref name="prelude">{{cite book|url=|last=Hargreaves|first=John|title=Prelude to the Partition of West Africa|access-date=|year=1963|publisher=MacMilland|location=London|pages=59–60|url-access=|via=|isbn=}}{{ISBN?}}</ref> The neighbouring [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] objected to French involvement in the region and war broke out between the two states. In 1883, Porto-Novo was incorporated into the French "colony of [[Dahomey]] and its dependencies" and in 1900, it became Dahomey's capital city.<ref name="Bradt"/> As a consequence, a community that had previously exhibited endoglossic bilingualism now began to exhibit exoglossic bilingualism, with the addition of French to the language repertoire of the city's inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Unlike the city's earlier [[Ogu people|Gun]] migrants, however, the French sought to impose their language in all spheres of life and completely stamp out the use and proliferation of indigenous languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

[[File:Y Pranishnikoff, Porto Novo, Groupe de Naturels (1887).jpg|thumb|left|Porto-Novo (1887)]] 
The kings of Porto-Novo continued to rule in the city, both officially and unofficially, until the death of the last king, [[Alohinto Gbeffa]], in 1976.<ref name="Bradt">Butler, Stuart (2019) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Benin'', pgs. 121-131</ref> From 1908, the king held the title of ''Chef supérieur''.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Many [[Afro-Brazilian]]s settled in Porto-Novo following their return to Africa after [[abolitionism|emancipation]] in [[Brazil]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Brazilian architecture and foods are important to the city's cultural life.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Under French colonial rule, flight across the new [[Benin-Nigeria border|border]] to British-ruled [[Nigeria]] in order to avoid harsh taxation, military service and forced labour was common.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Of note is the fact that the Nigeria-Benin southern border area arbitrarily cuts through contiguous areas of Yoruba and [[Ogu people|Egun]]-speaking people. A combination of the aforementioned facts, coupled with the fact that the city itself lies within the sphere of Nigerian socioeconomic influence, have given Porto-Novians a preference for some measure of bi-nationality or dual citizenship, with the necessary linguistic consequences; for example, Nigerian home video films in Yoruba with English subtitles have become popular in Porto-Novo and its suburbs.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

==Seat of government==
Benin's parliament ([[National Assembly (Benin)|''Assemblée nationale'']]) is in Porto-Novo, the official capital, but [[Cotonou]] is the seat of government and houses most of the governmental ministries.

== Economy ==
[[File:Marche ouando porto-novo.jpg|thumb|300px|Ouando Market in Porto-Novo]]

== Transport ==
[[File:Joseph H Ahissou photo charcoal transportation in PortoNovo.jpg|thumb|Charcoal transportation by motorcycle]]
Porto-Novo is served by an extension of the [[Bénirail]] train system.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Privately owned motorcycle taxis known as ''zemijan'' are used throughout the city.<ref>{{Citation|title=ZEMIJAN - Taxis motos (Bénin, ancien Dahomey)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-nzWaCHRiE|language=en|access-date=2023-02-18}}</ref> The city is located about {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} away from [[Cotonou Airport]], which has flights to major cities in West Africa and Europe.

== Demographics ==
Porto-Novo had an enumerated population of 264,320 in 2013.<ref name="citypopulation.de"/> The residents are mostly [[Yoruba People|Yoruba]] and Gun people as well as people from other parts of the country, and from neighbouring [[Nigeria]].

Population trend:<ref name="citypopulation.de"/>
*1979: 133,168  (census)
*1992: 179,138  (census)
*2002: 223,552  (census)
*2013: 264,320  (census)

== Geography and climate ==
Porto-Novo has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') with consistently hot and humid conditions and two wet seasons: a long wet season from March to July and a shorter rain season in September and October. The city’s location on the edge of the [[Dahomey Gap]] makes it much drier than would be expected so close to the equator, although it is less dry than [[Accra]] or [[Lomé]].
