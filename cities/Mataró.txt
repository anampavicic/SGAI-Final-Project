'''Mataró''' ({{IPA|ca|mətəˈɾo}}) is the capital and largest town of the [[Maresme]] county in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It is located on the [[Costa del Maresme|Maresme coast]], to the south of [[Costa Brava]], between [[Cabrera de Mar]] and [[Sant Andreu de Llavaneres]], {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} north-east of [[Barcelona]]. {{As of|2021}}, it had a population of 129,749.

==History==
[[File:Catalonia Mataró Vil·laRomanaDeCanLlauder VistaGeneral.JPG|thumb|[[Roman villa of Can Llauder]].]]
Mataró dates back to [[Roman Republic|Roman]] times when it was a village known as "Iluro" or "Illuro". The ruins of a first-century BC Roman [[Thermae|bath house]] (known locally as the ''Torre Llauder'') were recently discovered and can be visited. The coastal {{nowrap|[[Carretera Nacional N-II|N-II highway]]}} follows the same path as the original Roman road, [[Via Augusta]].

Mataró was declared a city by royal decree, even though at the time (nineteenth century) the population fell short of the requirement for city status.

The first [[railway]] in [[peninsular Spain]] was the Mataró – [[Barcelona]] line which opened on 28 October 1848 by the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] businessman and Mataró native [[Miquel Biada]]. This line now forms part of the [[Renfe]]/[[Rodalies de Catalunya]] [[R1–RG1 (Rodalies de Catalunya)|R1]] suburban service between [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] and [[Maçanet de la Selva|Maçanet-Massanes]]. Mataró is also connected with Barcelona and [[Girona]] by the {{nowrap|[[C-32 highway (Spain)|C-32 ''autopista'']]}} (freeway) and with [[Granollers]] by the {{nowrap|[[Autovia C-60|C-60 ''autopista'']]}}.

During the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, Mataró was the starting point for the [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|marathon]] events.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s2.pdf 1992 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011647/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s2.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }} Volume 2. pp. 204-6.</ref>

==Main sights==
Mataró is the birthplace of the ''[[noucentisme|noucentista]]'' [[architect]] [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], who designed the ''ajuntament'' (town hall) and several other notable buildings in the town:
* [[Casa Coll i Regàs]].
* Casa Parera.
* Casa Sisternes.
* El Rengle.
* [[Hermitage of St. Simon]].
* La Beneficiència.
* Mataró City Wall. (was built between 1569 and 1600 and was designed by the military engineer Jorge de Setara. This wall is supposed to follow, to a large extent, the line of the old Roman wall. It was built with small stones bound with lime mortar. The Mataró City Wall had seven large gates, as well as attached towers that gave it greater defence.  During the 19th century, many sections of the old Mataró City Wall were demolished.)

Nearby the town are the archaeological remains of the [[Roman villa of Can Llauder]].

==Agriculture==
The traditional [[vineyard]]s were devastated by [[Phylloxera]] in the nineteenth century and only partially replanted, due to the growth of the tourist industry and the development of [[irrigation]] in the area. [[Potato]]es were one of the first replacement crops to be introduced, especially the ''[[Royal Kidney potato|Royal Kidney]]'' variety, and Mataró obtained a ''[[Protected Geographical Status|Denominació d'Origen]]'' in 1932.<ref>Source: [[:ca:Mataro|Catalan Wikipedia]]. This ''Denominació d'Origen'' is not currently (2006) protected at [[European Union]] level (see [http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/qual/es/es_es.htm list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117133554/http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/qual/es/es_es.htm |date=17 January 2007 }}).</ref> ''[[Trocadero lettuce|Trocadero]]'' [[lettuce]] and [[pea]]s are also grown, mostly for export. The production of cut flowers is less important than in other towns of the [[Maresme]]. Irrigated land made up {{convert|9.13|km²|2|abbr=out}} of the {{convert|10.57|km²|2|abbr=out}} of agricultural land in the municipality in 1986 (47% of the municipal territory).

In modern [[viticulture]], the red [[mourvèdre]] grape variety is a better-known synonym for the grape known in Spain, the U.S., and Australia as mataro. Mataró, the city, is thought to be the likely origin of mataro, the wine grape.

==Climate==
Mataró has a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' in [[Köppen climate classification]]) bordering with a [[Hot-summer mediterranean climate]], ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'').
