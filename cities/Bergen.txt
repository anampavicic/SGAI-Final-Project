'''Bergen''' ({{IPA|no|ˈbæ̀rɡn̩|-|Bergen.ogg}}), historically '''Bjørgvin''', is a city and [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Vestland]] county on the [[Western Norway|west coast]] of [[Norway]]. {{As of|2021|01|alt=As of 2022}}, its population was roughly 289,330.<ref name="Pop2021Q1">{{Cite web |date=19 May 2021 |title=Folketall per 1. januar 2022 |url=https://www.bergen.kommune.no/omkommunen/fakta-om-bergen/befolkning/folketall-per-1-januar-2022 |access-date=10 August 2022 |publisher=SSB|language=nb}}</ref> Bergen is the [[list of towns and cities in Norway|second-largest]] city in Norway after the national capital [[Oslo]]. The municipality covers {{convert|465|km2}} and is located on the peninsula of [[Bergenshalvøyen]]. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]], 'the city fjord'. The city is surrounded by mountains, causing Bergen to be called the "city of [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|seven mountains]]". Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the administrative centre of Vestland county.  The city consists of eight boroughs: [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Bergenhus]], [[Fana]], [[Fyllingsdalen]], [[Laksevåg]], [[Ytrebygda]], [[Årstad, Bergen|Årstad]], and [[Åsane]].

Trading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by King [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]] and was named Bjørgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a [[Kontor|bureau city]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between [[Northern Norway]] and abroad, and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as [[Oslo]]). What remains of the quays, [[Bryggen]], is a World Heritage Site. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The [[Bergen School of Meteorology]] was developed at the [[Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen|Geophysical Institute]] starting in 1917, the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] was founded in 1936, and the [[University of Bergen]] in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own [[counties of Norway|county]]. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.

The city is an international centre for aquaculture, shipping, the offshore petroleum industry and subsea technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. [[Bergen Port]] is Norway's busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Heggemsnes |first=Nils |date=26 September 2012 |title=Bergen Havn |url=https://snl.no/Bergen_havn |access-date=8 January 2016 |website=Store norske leksikon |language=nb}}</ref> a number that has doubled in 10 years.<ref name="Port of Bergen">{{Cite web |date=2016 |title=Cruisestatistikk |url=http://bergenhavn.no/cruise/cruisestatistikk/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526145406/http://bergenhavn.no/cruise/cruisestatistikk/ |archive-date=26 May 2015 |access-date=8 January 2016 |website=Cruise |publisher=Port of Bergen |language=nb}}</ref> Almost half of the passengers are German or British.<ref name="Port of Bergen" /> The city's main football team is [[SK Brann]] and a unique tradition of the city is the [[buekorps]],  which are traditional marching neighbourhood youth organisations. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as [[Bergensk]]. The city features [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]] and [[Bergen Light Rail]], and is the terminus of the [[Bergen Line]]. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.

Bergen has a mild winter climate, though with significant precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can, in rare cases, be up to {{convert|20|C-change}} warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60° North. In summer however, Bergen is several degrees cooler than Oslo due to the same maritime effects. The Gulf Stream keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.

The city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]], son of [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardråde]] in 1070{{spaces}}AD,<ref name="omkomm">{{Cite web |last=Elisabeth Farstad |year=2007 |title=Om kommunen |url=http://www.bergen.kommune.no/aktuelt/omkommunen |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005165817/http://www.bergen.kommune.no/aktuelt/omkommunen |archive-date=5 October 2007 |access-date=16 September 2007 |publisher=Bergen kommune |language=nb}}</ref> four years after the Viking Age in England ended with the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement had already been established in the 1020s or 1030s.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hella |first=Asle |date=2004-06-07 |title=Bergens historie må skrives om |url=https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.201637 |work=[[NRK]] |language=nb}}</ref>

Bergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city's cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. [[Bergenhus fortress]] dates from the 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to [[Oslo]] during the reign of King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] (1299–1319).

In the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four ''{{lang|de|[[Kontor]]e}}'' of the [[Hanseatic League]] at [[Bryggen]] in Bergen. The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast,<ref name="codmr">{{Cite web |last=Marguerite Ragnow |year=2007 |title=Cod |url=http://bell.lib.umn.edu/Products/cod.html |access-date=14 August 2007}}</ref> which started {{Circa|1100|lk=no}}. The city was granted a monopoly for trade from the north of Norway by King [[Håkon Håkonsson]] (1217–1263).<ref name="Stockfish">{{Cite news |last=Tom R.

In 1665, the city's harbour was the site of the [[Battle of Vågen]], when an English naval flotilla attacked a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet supported by the city's garrison. Accidental fires sometimes got out of control, and one in 1702 reduced most of the town to ashes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The fire of 1702 |url=https://kulturpunkt.org/article/875/ |access-date=3 May 2023 |website=kulturpunkt.org |publisher=[[Bergen City Museum]]}}</ref>

Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Bergen remained one of the largest cities in [[Scandinavia]], and it was Norway's biggest city until the 1830s,<ref name="attentretti">{{Cite web |title=Innvandring 1600–2000, Arkivenes dag 2002 |url=http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/sab/innvandring/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021206093817/http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/sab/innvandring/index.html |archive-date=6 December 2002 |access-date=9 October 2007 |publisher=Arkivverket |language=nb}}</ref> being overtaken by the capital city of [[Oslo]]. From around 1600, the Hanseatic dominance of the city's trade gradually declined in favour of Norwegian merchants (often of Hanseatic ancestry), and in the 1750s, the ''{{lang|de|Kontor}}'', or major trading post of the Hanseatic League, finally closed. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Bergen was involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Bergen-based slave trader [[Jørgen Thormøhlen]], the largest shipowner in Norway, was the main owner of the [[slave ship]] ''Cornelia'', which made two slave-trading voyages in 1673 and 1674 respectively; he also developed the city's industrial sector, particularly in the neighbourhood of [[Møhlenpris]], which is named after him.<ref name="nbl">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Jørgen Thormøhlen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Jørgen_Thormøhlen |last=Fossen |first=Anders Bjarne |editor-last=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref> Bergen retained its monopoly of trade with northern Norway until 1789.<ref name="histnor">{{Cite web |last=Ivan Kristoffersen |author-link=Ivan Kristoffersen |year=2003 |title=Historien om Norge i nord |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/dok/NOU-er/2003/NOU-2003-32/10.html?id=373172 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328031006/http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/dok/NOU-er/2003/NOU-2003-32/10.html?id=373172 |archive-date=28 March 2008 |access-date=9 October 2007 |publisher=Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |language=no}}</ref> The Bergen stock exchange, the ''{{lang|no|Bergen børs}}'', was established in 1813.

During World War II, Bergen was occupied on the first day of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, after a brief fight between German ships and the Norwegian [[coastal artillery]].

===Fires===
The city's history is marked by numerous great fires. In 1198, the {{lang|no|[[Bagler]]}} faction set fire to the city in connection with a battle against the {{lang|no|[[Birkebeiner]]}} faction during the civil war. In 1248, {{lang|no|Holmen}} and {{lang|no|Sverresborg}} burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by the [[Victual Brothers]], and in 1455, [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchants were responsible for burning down [[Munkeliv Abbey]]. In 1476, {{lang|no|Bryggen}} burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and {{lang|no|Strandsiden}}. In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in {{lang|no|Øvregaten}}. In 1686 another great fire hit {{lang|no|Strandsiden}}, destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire in history was in 1702, when 90% of the city was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at {{lang|no|Vågsbunnen}}. In 1756, yet another fire at {{lang|no|Strandsiden}} burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit {{lang|no|Strandsiden}} in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings [[Bergen fire of 1916|burned down]] in the city centre including the [[Swan pharmacy]], the oldest pharmacy in Norway, and in 1955 parts of {{lang|no|Bryggen}} burned down.

===Toponymy===
Bergen is pronounced in English {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜːr|g|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛər|g|ən}} and in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{IPA-no|ˈbæ̀rɡn̩||Bergen.ogg}} (in [[Bergensk|the local dialect]] {{IPA-all|ˈbæ̂ʁɡɛn|}}). The [[Old Norse]] forms of the name were ''{{lang|non|Bergvin}}'' {{IPA-non|ˈberɡˌwin|}} and ''{{lang|non|Bjǫrgvin}}'' {{IPA-non|ˈbjɔrɡˌwin|}} (and in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the city is still called ''{{lang|is|Björgvin}}''). The first element is {{wikt-lang|non|berg}} (n.) or ''{{lang|non|bjǫrg}}'' (n.), which translates as 'mountain(s)'. The last element is {{wikt-lang|non|vin}} (f.), which means a new settlement where there used to be a pasture or meadow. The full meaning is then "the meadow among the mountains".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brekke |first=Nils Georg |title=Kulturhistorisk vegbok Hordaland |publisher=Hordaland Fylkeskommune |year=1993 |isbn=82-7326-026-7 |location=Bergen |page=252 |language=no}}</ref> This is a suitable name: Bergen is often called "the city among the seven mountains". It was the playwright [[Ludvig Holberg]] who felt so inspired by the [[seven hills of Rome]], that he decided that his home town must be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains – and locals still argue which seven they are.

In 1918, there was a campaign to reintroduce the Norse form ''{{lang|non|Bjørgvin}}'' as the name of the city. This was turned down – but as a compromise, the name of the [[diocese]] was changed to ''{{lang|no|[[Diocese of Bjørgvin|Bjørgvin bispedømme]]}}''.<ref name="bispedoeme">{{Cite web |year=2004 |title=Bjørgvin bispedøme |url=http://www.scandion.no/article/archive/826/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226020759/http://www.scandion.no/article/archive/826/ |archive-date=26 December 2007 |access-date=10 October 2007 |publisher=Scandion.no |language=no}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:TettstedetBergen.jpg|thumb|left|Bergen: Urban areas ([[Statistics Norway]])]]
Bergen occupies most of the peninsula of [[Bergenshalvøyen]] in the [[districts of Norway|district]] of [[Midthordland]] in mid-western Hordaland. The municipality covers an area of {{convert|465|km2|0|abbr=off}}. Most of the urban area is on or close to a fjord or bay, although the urban area has several mountains. The city centre is surrounded by the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although there is disagreement as to which of the nine mountains constitute these. [[Ulriken]], [[Fløyen]], [[Løvstakken]] and [[Damsgårdsfjellet]] are always included as well as three of [[Lyderhorn]], [[Sandviksfjellet]], [[Blåmanen]], [[Rundemanen]] and [[Kolbeinsvarden]].<ref name="syvendehm">{{Cite web |last=Gunhild Agdesteen |year=2007 |title=I den syvende himmel |url=http://www.bt.no/kuriosa/article380762.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041155/http://www.bt.no/kuriosa/article380762.ece |archive-date=30 September 2007 |access-date=14 August 2007 |website=Bergens Tidende |language=no}}</ref> [[Gullfjellet]] is Bergen's highest mountain, at {{convert|987|m}} [[above mean sea level]].<ref name="wcpeaks">{{Cite web |title=Norwegian Mountains: Gullfjellstoppen |url=http://www.westcoastpeaks.com/Peaks/gullfjellstoppen.html |access-date=8 September 2007}}</ref> Bergen is far enough north that during clear nights at the solstice, there is borderline civil daylight in spite of the sun having set.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sunrise and sunset times in Bergen, June |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/norway/bergen?month=6 |access-date=4 July 2023 |publisher=Timeanddate.com}}</ref>

Bergen is sheltered from the North Sea by the islands [[Askøy]], [[Holsnøy]] (the municipality of [[Meland]]) and [[Sotra]] (the municipalities of [[Fjell]] and [[Sund, Norway|Sund]]). Bergen borders the municipalities [[Alver (municipality)|Alver]] and [[Osterøy]] to the north, [[Vaksdal]] and [[Samnanger]] to the east, [[Os, Hordaland|Os]] ([[Bjørnafjorden (municipality)|Bjørnafjorden]]) and [[Austevoll]] to the south, and [[Øygarden]] and [[Askøy]] to the west.

==Climate==
[[File:Bergen vågsallmenningen rain.jpg|thumb|left|Bergen on a rainy day]]
Bergen has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dolk''), with mild summers and cool winters. Rainfall is plentiful in all seasons, along with intermittent snowfall during winter, which often melts quickly. The exceptionally plentiful precipitation that defines the city is caused by [[orographic lift]], sometimes causing more than two months of consecutive rainy days.<ref name="nedboersrekord">{{Cite web |last=ANB-NTB |year=2007 |title=Stopp for nedbørsrekord |url=http://www.siste.no/Innenriks/var_og_uvar/article2537456.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015155849/http://www.siste.no/Innenriks/var_og_uvar/article2537456.ece |archive-date=15 October 2007 |access-date=9 October 2007 |publisher=siste.no |language=no}}</ref> The city is therefore considered the rainiest city in Europe, although it is not the wettest "place" on the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Meze-Hausken |first=Elisabeth |date=October 2007 |title=Seasons in the sun—weather and climate front-page news stories in Europe's rainiest city, Bergen, Norway |journal=International Journal of Biometeorology |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=17–31 |bibcode=2007IJBm...52...17M |doi=10.1007/s00484-006-0064-5 |issn=1432-1254 |pmid=17245564 |s2cid=29081365 |hdl-access=free |hdl=1956/2114}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The rainiest city in Europe.

Bergen's weather is much warmer than the city's latitude (60.4° N) might suggest. Temperatures below −10&nbsp;°C (14&nbsp;°F) are rare. Summer temperatures sometimes reach the upper 20s, although temperatures over 30{{spaces}}°C were previously only seen a few days each decade. The growing season in Bergen is exceptionally long for its latitude, more than 200 days. Its mild winters and proximity to the Gulf Stream provide the city with a [[Hardiness zone|plant hardiness zone]] of 8b and 9a depending on location; this zone is much more common below 50°N even in Europe, with cities as far south as [[Bordeaux]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Istanbul]] falling into this category. The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below {{convert|0|°C|1|abbr=on}}) in spring is April 4<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 May 2012 |title=Siste frostnatt om våren |url=https://www.yr.no/artikkel/siste-frostnatt-om-varen-1.8119060}}</ref> and average date for first freeze in autumn is November 7<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 September 2013 |title=Første frostnatt |url=https://www.yr.no/artikkel/forste-frostnatt-1.11261900}}</ref> giving a frost-free season of 216 days.

Extreme temperatures are also quite rare in the city. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|33.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on 26 July 2019,<ref>{{Cite news |date=26 July 2019 |title=Nå er 33,4 den nye varmerekorden i Bergen |url=https://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/i/QoE3rA/Na-er-33_4-den-nye-varmerekorden-i-Bergen |access-date=26 July 2019 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=no}}</ref> beating the previous record from 2018 at {{convert|32.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}} degrees, and the lowest was {{convert|-16.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in January 1987.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bjørbæk |first=G |title=Norsk vær i 110 år |publisher=N.W. DAMM & Sønn |year=2003 |isbn=8204086954 |page=260}}</ref>

The city is quite cloudy year round, although old sunshine hours data might have caused an underestimate of sunshine hours, due to the city's mountainside location.<ref name="soltimer Bergen">{{Cite web |date=10 February 2017 |title=Over 1600 soltimer i Bergen i fjor trass i elendig vær i skoleferien |url=http://www.arstadposten.no/2017/02/10/1600-soltimer-bergen-fjor-trass-elendig-vaer-skoleferien/}}</ref> A new sun recorder was established at [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]] (a location with less terrain obscuring the sun) in December 2015, and this recorded an average of 1,596 hours of sun annually during 2016–2022.<ref name="Arstadposten">{{Cite web |date=22 February 2022 |title=Årstadposten – Nytt fra Årstad siden 1993 |url=https://www.arstadposten.no/2023/11/30/naer-80-soltimer-i-bergen-i-november-dobbelt-sa-mange-som-normalen/ |access-date=24 February 2024 |publisher=Arstadposten.no}}</ref>

As of 2007, people of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] origin (those who have two parents born in Norway) make up 84.5% of Bergen's residents. In addition, 8.1% were [[Immigrant generations|first]] or second generation immigrants of Western background and 7.4% were first or second generation immigrants of non-Western background.<ref name="ssbtall" /> The population grew by 4,549 people in 2009, a growth rate of 1.8%. Ninety-six percent of the population lives in urban areas. As of 2002, the average [[gross income]] for men above the age of 17 is 426,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK), the average gross income for women above the age of 17 is NOK{{spaces}}238,000, with the total average gross income being NOK{{spaces}}330,000.<ref name="ssbtall">{{Cite web |title=SSB: Tall om Bergen kommune |url=http://www.ssb.no/kommuner/hoyre_side.cgi?region=1201 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001031834/http://www.ssb.no/kommuner/hoyre_side.cgi?region=1201 |archive-date=1 October 2007 |access-date=1 October 2007 |publisher=Statistics Norway |language=no}}</ref> In 2007, there were 104.6 men for every 100 women in the age group of 20–39.<ref name="ssbtall" /> 22.8% of the population were under 17{{spaces}}years of age, while 4.5% were 80 and above.

The immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from more than 200 countries representing 15.5% of the city's population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993–2008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergen's population growth and 60.8% of Norway's population growth during the period 1993–2008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Statistics Norway |url=http://statbank.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/Default_FR.asp?PXSid=0&nvl=true&PLanguage=0&tilside=selecttable/hovedtabellHjem.asp&KortnavnWeb=innvbef |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526191822/http://statbank.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/Default_FR.asp?PXSid=0&nvl=true&PLanguage=0&tilside=selecttable/hovedtabellHjem.asp&KortnavnWeb=innvbef |archive-date=26 May 2012 |access-date=4 January 2012 |publisher=Stat Bank}}</ref>

The immigrant population in Bergen has changed a lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western immigrant population in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also in relation to the total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of [[Polish people|Poles]] in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.<ref>[http://www.bt.no/multimedia/archive/00321/Faktaark_321842a.pdf Immigrant population in Bergen]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

As of 2022, immigrants of non-Western origin and their children enumerated 30,540, and made up an estimated 11% of Bergen's population.

The city centre of Bergen lies in the west of the municipality, facing the fjord of [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]]. It is among a group of mountains known as the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although the number is a matter of definition. From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. [[Årstad, Bergen|Årstad]], inner [[Laksevåg]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]]), the majority of the population lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by [[apartment|apartment building]]s and modern [[terraced house]]s (e.g. [[Fyllingsdalen]]), others are dominated by [[single-family detached home|single-family home]]s.<ref name="bl27">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1994 |title=Bergen |encyclopedia=[[Bergen Byleksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |last=Hagen Hartvedt |first=Gunnar |edition=1st |pages=27 |isbn=82-573-0485-9}}</ref>

[[File:SkansenSeptember2007 2.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the city centre with [[Torgallmenningen]]]]
The oldest part of Bergen is the area around the bay of Vågen in the city centre. Originally centred on the bay's eastern side, Bergen eventually expanded west and southwards. Few buildings from the oldest period remain, the most significant being [[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]] from the 12th century. For several hundred years, the extent of the city remained almost constant. The population was stagnant, and the city limits were narrow.<ref name="bl23">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1994 |title=Bergen |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |last=Hagen Hartvedt |first=Gunnar |edition=1st |pages=23 |isbn=82-573-0485-9}}</ref> In 1702, seven-eighths of the city burned. Most of the old buildings of Bergen, including Bryggen (which was rebuilt in a mediaeval style), were built after the fire. The fire marked a transition from [[tar]] covered houses, as well as the remaining [[log home|log house]]s, to painted and some brick-covered wooden buildings.<ref name="bl25">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1994 |title=Bergen |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |last=Hagen Hartvedt |first=Gunnar |edition=1st |pages=25 |isbn=82-573-0485-9}}</ref>

[[File:Marienkirche in Bergen 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]]]]
The last half of the 19th century saw a period of rapid expansion and modernisation. The fire of 1855 west of [[Torgallmenningen]] led to the development of regularly sized city blocks in this area of the city centre. The city limits were expanded in 1876, and [[Nygård, Norway|Nygård]], [[Møhlenpris]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]] were urbanized with large-scale construction of city blocks housing both the poor and the wealthy.<ref name="bt_nygaardshøyden">{{Cite news |last=Østerbø |first=Kjell |date=23 September 2007 |title=Da rike og fattige fikk sine strøk |url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article413890.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625091158/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article413890.ece |archive-date=25 June 2008 |access-date=18 December 2008 |work=Bergens Tidende |language=no}}</ref> Their architecture is influenced by a variety of styles; [[historicism (art)|historicism]], [[classicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name="bl2526">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1994 |title=Bergen |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |last=Hagen Hartvedt |first=Gunnar |edition=1st |pages=25–26 |isbn=82-573-0485-9}}</ref> The wealthy built villas between Møhlenpris and Nygård, and on the side of Mount Fløyen; these areas were also added to Bergen in 1876. Simultaneously, an urbanization process was taking place in [[Solheimsviken]] in Årstad, at that time outside the Bergen municipality, centred on the large industrial activity in the area.<ref name="bl2627">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1994 |title=Bergen |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |last=Hagen Hartvedt |first=Gunnar |edition=1st |pages=26–27 |isbn=82-573-0485-9}}</ref> The workers' homes in this area were poorly built, and little remains after large-scale redevelopment in the 1960s–1980s.

[[File:Kong Oscars gate, Bergen 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Kong Oscars gate]]]]
After Årstad became a part of Bergen in 1916, a development plan was applied to the new area. Few city blocks akin to those in Nygård and Møhlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in [[Landås]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired [[Fyllingsdalen]] from [[Fana (municipality)|Fana]] municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. [[Lambertseter]]), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, [[Tower block|mid-rise]]s, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen's city limits, for example in [[Loddefjord]].<ref name="bl961">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1994 |title=Bergen |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |last=Hagen Hartvedt |first=Gunnar |edition=1st |pages=9–61 |isbn=82-573-0485-9}}</ref> 
[[File:06.05.25 16 Fra Nordnes i Bergen.JPG|thumb|View from the Nordnes part of Bergen]]
At the same time as [[New town|planned city]] expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in [[Åsane]] and Laksevåg. Most of the homes in these areas are detached [[Terraced house|row house]]s,{{clarify|reason=row houses are attached, by definition|date=April 2020}} single family homes or small apartment buildings.<ref name="bl961" /> After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future [[Bergen Light Rail]] stations, and elsewhere.<ref name="bt_fortetting1">{{Cite news |last=Mæland |first=Pål Andreas |date=16 May 2008 |title=Nå kommer slangen til Paradis |url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112052521/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece |archive-date=12 January 2013 |access-date=18 December 2008 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=no}}</ref><ref name="bt_fortetting2">{{Cite news |last=Røyrane |first=Eva |date=9 May 2007 |title=Bergen bygges tettere |url=http://bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100820/http://www.bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |archive-date=7 August 2011 |access-date=18 December 2008 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=no}}</ref>

As part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the [[Local government|city government]] ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely [[Nordnes]], Marken, and Stølen. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and Stølen redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.<ref name="bl961" />

Demolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at Nøstet.<ref name="bt_jonsvoll">{{Cite news |last=Okkenhaug |first=Liv Solli |date=21 April 2007 |title=Rev de siste husene |url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427074218/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece |archive-date=27 April 2007 |access-date=18 December 2008 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=no}}</ref>

The city centre is located in [[Bergenhus]].

Local borough administrations have varied since Bergen's expansion in 1972. From 1974, each borough had a politically chosen administration. From 1989, Bergen was divided into 12 health and social districts, each locally administered. From 2000 to 2004, the former organizational form with eight politically chosen local administrations was again in use and from 2008 through to 2010, a similar form existed where the local administrations had less power than previously.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lokaldemokratiets utvikling 1814 – 2014 |url=https://www.bergen.kommune.no/omkommunen/avdelinger/byradsavd-for-klima-kultur-og-naring/2435/article-114765 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819185132/https://www.bergen.kommune.no/omkommunen/avdelinger/byradsavd-for-klima-kultur-og-naring/2435/article-114765 |archive-date=19 August 2016 |access-date=10 June 2016 |website=Bergen kommune |language=nb}}</ref>

[[Bergensk]] is the native dialect of Bergen. It was strongly influenced by [[Low German]]-speaking merchants from the mid-14th to mid-18th centuries. During the [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian period]] from 1536 to 1814, Bergen was more influenced by [[Danish language|Danish]] than other areas of Norway. The Danish influence removed the female [[grammatical gender]] in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are [[uvular trill]]s, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the [[alveolar trill]] in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved [[literacy rate]], Bergensk was influenced by [[Norwegian Bokmål|riksmål]] and bokmål in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired [[vocabulary]] disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.<ref name="slikblevi">{{Cite book |last=Nesse |first=Agnete |title=Slik ble vi bergensere – Hanseatene og bergensdialekten |publisher=Sigma Forlag |year=2003 |isbn=82-7916-028-0}}</ref>
