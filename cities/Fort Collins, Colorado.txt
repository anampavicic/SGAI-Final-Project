The city is the [[Colorado municipalities by population|fourth most populous city]] in Colorado. Situated on the [[Cache La Poudre River]] along the [[Colorado Front Range]], Fort Collins is located {{convert|56|mi||abbr=on}} north of the [[Colorado State Capitol]] in [[Denver]]. 

Fort Collins is a prominent college town, home to [[Colorado State University]], a public research university and the second-largest university by enrollment in Colorado.<ref>{{cite web |title=College Navigator - Colorado State University |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics |url=https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=colorado+state+university&s=all&id=126818}}</ref>

==History==
The [[Northern Arapaho]] were centered in the [[Cache la Poudre River]] Valley near present-day Fort Collins. [[Friday (Arapaho chief)|Friday]], who attended school in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] in his youth, was a leader of the band of Arapahos as well as an interpreter, negotiator, and peacemaker. He made friends of white settlers who moved into the area, but was pushed out of Colorado in the 1860s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dunn |first=Meg |title=Friday, the Arapaho – Northern Colorado History |url=http://www.northerncoloradohistory.com/friday-the-arapaho/ |access-date=December 8, 2021 |language=en-US |archive-date=December 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208030118/https://www.northerncoloradohistory.com/friday-the-arapaho/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Fort Collins was founded as a military outpost of the [[United States Army]] in 1864. It succeeded a previous encampment, known as [[Camp Collins]], on the [[Cache la Poudre River]], near what is known today as [[Laporte, Colorado|Laporte]]. Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the region. Travelers crossing the county on the [[Overland Trail]] would camp there, but a flood destroyed the camp in June 1864.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.fort-collins.co.us/oem/historical-flooding.php |title=Flooding Timeline in Fort Collins |access-date=September 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125183726/http://www.ci.fort-collins.co.us/oem/historical-flooding.php |archive-date=January 25, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Afterward, the commander of the fort wrote to the commandant of [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]] in southeast Wyoming, Colonel [[William O. Collins]], suggesting that a site several miles farther down the river would make a good location for the fort. The post was manned originally by two companies of the [[11th Ohio Cavalry Regiment|11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry]] and never had walls.<ref name = "l1860"/>

Settlers began arriving in the vicinity of the fort nearly immediately. The fort was decommissioned in 1867. The original fort site is now adjacent to the present historic "Old Town" portion of the city. The first school and church opened in 1866, and the town was [[plat]]ted in 1867. The civilian population of Fort Collins, led by local businessman Joseph Mason, led an effort to relocate the county seat to Fort Collins from LaPorte, and they were successful in 1868.<ref name="l1860">{{cite web |url=http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1860.php |title=Fort Collins Time Line 1860 |access-date=March 24, 2007 |work=Fort Collins Local History Archive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710232717/http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1860.php |archive-date=July 10, 2011  }}</ref>

The city's first population boom came in 1872, with the establishment of an agricultural colony. Hundreds of settlers arrived, developing lots just south of the original Old Town. Tension between new settlers and earlier inhabitants led to political divisions in the new town, which was incorporated in 1873. Although the Colorado Agricultural College was founded in 1870, the first classes were held in 1879.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcome.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=history |title=History of Colorado State University |access-date=May 12, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012223229/http://welcome.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=history |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The 1880s saw the construction of a number of elegant homes and commercial buildings and the growth of a distinctive identity for Fort Collins. Stone quarrying, sugar-beet farming, and the [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] of sheep were among the area's earliest industries. Beet tops, an industry supported by the college and its associated agricultural experiment station, proved to be an excellent and abundant food for local sheep,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1890.php |title=Fort Collins Time Line 1890 |access-date=March 24, 2007 |work=Fort Collins Local History Archive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710232732/http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1890.php |archive-date=July 10, 2011  }}</ref> and by the early 1900s the area was being referred to as the "Lamb feeding capital of the world". In 1901 the Great Western sugar processing plant was built in the neighboring city of [[Loveland, Colorado|Loveland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1900.php |title=Fort Collins Time Line 1900 |access-date=March 24, 2007 |work=Fort Collins Local History Archive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710232757/http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1900.php |archive-date=July 10, 2011  }}</ref>

The [[Poudre River Public Library District]] operates three branch locations in the city of Fort Collins—Old Town, Harmony, and Council Tree.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District">{{Cite web |last=Poudre River Public Library District |title=About Us |url=https://www.poudrelibraries.org/about/ |access-date= |website=poudrelibraries.org}}</ref> The Library District was established in 2006 by voter approval, and aims to serve the more than 207,000 people in northern Larimer County, Colorado.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District" /> The district is governed by a board of volunteer trustees, jointly appointed by the city of Fort Collins and Larimer County.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Poudre River Public Library District |title=Board |url=https://www.poudrelibraries.org/board/ |website=poudrelibraries.org}}</ref>

The library participates in cooperative projects with the local [[Poudre School District]] and [[Colorado State University]].

==== Facilities ====
The Old Town Library (formerly, the Main Library) is a 43,000 square foot facility that has served the Fort Collins Community since 1976.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1">{{Cite web |last=Poudre River Public Library District |title=Facts |url=https://www.poudrelibraries.org/about/facts |website=poudrelibraries.org}}</ref> It is located in the Fort Collins Old Town Historic District at 201 Peterson Street.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1" />

The Harmony Library is a 30,000 square foot joint-use facility located on the [[Front Range Community College]] campus, at 4616 South Shield Street in Fort Collins.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1" /> Since its opening in 1998, the facility has served both the Community College (students, faculty, and staff) and the general public.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1" />

The Council Tree Library is a nearly 18,000 square foot facility that opened in 2009 in the Front Range Village (a retail commons) and is located at 2733 Council Tree Avenue in Fort Collins.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1" /> The facility has a unique neighborhood atmosphere with an emphasis on families with young children.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1" />

The Webster House Administration Center opened in 2011 and houses the administration, collections, systems administration, maintenance, communications, and outreach staff.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1" /> The center's opening freed up 3,000 square feet in the Old Town Library, space that is now used for library materials and services.<ref name="Poudre River Public Library District-1" />

==== History ====
The library as an institution in Fort Collins dates back to the late 19th century, where reading rooms were established in churches or other rented locations.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District">{{Cite web |last=Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District |title=The History of Public Libraries in Fort Collins |url=https://history.fcgov.com/visit/library-history |website=Fort Collins History Connection, an online collaboration between Fort Collins Museum of Discovery and Poudre River Public Library District}}</ref> In 1882, for example, a reading room was established in the back of a Presbyterian Church on Whitton Block.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> The [[Fort Collins Public Library]] was officially established in 1900, the sixth public library in the state.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> The city received $12,500 from philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]] to build the library, with the condition that it would be maintained as a free public library. It was completed in 1904 at a total cost of approximately $15,000.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hansen |first=James E. |title=Democracy's college in the Centennial State: a history of Colorado State University |publisher=Colorado State University |year=1977 |location=Fort Collins |pages=230–231}}</ref> When the Library opened, there were 2,770 books on hand.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> In 1937, the Library was awarded a grant from the [[Works Progress Administration|Work Projects Administration]] for an annex to the building that would double its space, allowing for the construction of an auditorium/community room that opened in 1939.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" />

As the Fort Collins community grew, so too did the need for more library space. In 1973, the City Council adopted a seven-year master plan which included a new library building.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> Voters approved a one percent tax increase to fund the plan.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> The new library building, named the Fort Collins Public Library (now, the Old Town Library), opened in 1976 and remains to this day in Library Park at 201 Peterson Street in Fort Collins.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" />

In 2006, with ongoing city budget cuts impacting library services, residents voted to create and fund a library district with a 62% majority.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> This initiated a transition period in 2007 of separating the library from the city, for example, transferring finances, staff, and property to the Library District.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> The library was also given a temporary name, the Fort Collins Regional Library District.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> An intergovernmental agreement was finally signed in December 2007, that detailed each party's responsibilities during the transfer.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" /> In 2009, after asking for ideas from the public, the Poudre River Public Library District was approved as the library's permanent name.<ref name="Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, Poudre River Public Library District" />

===Higher education===
[[File:CSU The Oval.jpg|thumb|right|The Oval, part of the CSU campus]]

====Streets====
Fort Collins' downtown streets form a grid with [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] running north and south on the east side of the city. Many of the streets are named after the town's founders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.fcgov.com/newsflashback/street|title=Street Names Recall Early History: News Flashbacks: Fort Collins History Connection|website=history.fcgov.com|access-date=February 24, 2019|archive-date=December 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211229045043/https://history.fcgov.com/newsflashback/street|url-status=live}}</ref> [[U.S. Highway 287 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 287]] becomes College Avenue inside the city and is the busiest street; It runs north and south, effectively bisecting the city, and serving as the east–west meridian, while Mountain Avenue is the north–south. [[Colorado State Highway 14|SH 14]] runs concurrent with US 287 at the northern city limit to Jefferson Street, running southeast along Jefferson (later turning into Riverside Avenue), then turning east onto Mulberry Street where it goes east out of the city after an interchange with Interstate 25.

====Transit and taxi====
Fort Collins also once had a municipally owned [[Tram|trolley]] service with three branches from the intersection of Mountain and College avenues. The trolley was begun in 1907 by the Denver and Interurban Railroad, which had the intention of connecting the Front Range of Colorado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortcollinstrolley.org/history.html|title=Fort Collins Municipal Railway – History|website=www.fortcollinstrolley.org|access-date=November 12, 2018|archive-date=November 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112141445/http://www.fortcollinstrolley.org/history.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It was closed in 1951 after ceasing to be profitable. In 1983–84, a portion of the Mountain Avenue line and one of the original trolley cars, Car 21, were restored as a [[heritage streetcar|heritage trolley]] service, under the same name used by the original system, the [[Fort Collins Municipal Railway]].<ref>Long, Raphael P.

The [[MAX Bus Rapid Transit (Colorado)|MAX Bus Rapid Transit]] is a [[bus rapid transit]] that provides service on the Mason Corridor Transitway parallel to College Avenue from Downtown Fort Collins to a transit center just south of Harmony Road. The trip takes approximately 15 minutes from end to end with various stops between. The service began in May 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2014/05/08/million-max-project-ready-roll-fort-collins/8883481/ | title = $87 million MAX project ready to roll in Fort Collins | date = May 9, 2014 | access-date = February 6, 2015 | archive-date = February 9, 2015 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20150209154830/http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2014/05/08/million-max-project-ready-roll-fort-collins/8883481/ | url-status = live }}</ref> The Mason Corridor and the Mason Express are intended to be the center of future [[transit-oriented development]].

Fort Collins is connected to [[Loveland, Colorado|Loveland]], [[Berthoud, Colorado|Berthoud]], [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]], and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] via the FLEX regional bus route. [[Greeley-Evans Transit]] operates a service called the Poudre Express connecting Fort Collins with [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]] and [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]].

[[Bustang]] provides additional intercity transportation for the city. Fort Collins is the northernmost stop on the North Line, which connects southward to Denver. Planning for restoration of regional passenger rail recommenced in earnest in 2017. Fort Collins would be an intermediate stop for the proposed north–south [[Front Range Passenger Rail]] corridor between [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] and [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], though it would be the northern terminus of most trips.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Vision for Front Range Passenger Rail |url=https://www.codot.gov/about/southwest-chief-commission-front-range-passenger-rail/news/vision |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation |access-date=August 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Front Range Corridor|url=https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/front-range-corridor/|access-date=January 24, 2023}}</ref>

====Railroads====
Freight service is provided by [[Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF]].

Currently there is no intercity passenger service; the last remaining services connecting the Front Range cities ceased with the formation of [[Amtrak]] in 1971. [[Front Range Passenger Rail]] is a current proposal to link the cities from [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] in the south, north to Fort Collins and possibly to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heins |first1=Nicole |title=Amtrak hopes to reduce I-25 traffic by creating a passenger rail along the Front Range |url=https://www.kktv.com/2021/04/13/amtrak-hopes-to-reduce-i-25-traffic-by-creating-a-passenger-rail-along-the-front-range/ |access-date=January 1, 2022 |work=KKTV 11 News |date=April 13, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

The [[Fort Collins Municipal Railway]] was a [[tram|streetcar]] system from 1919 to 1951, and from 1984 has been partially reinstated as a seasonal [[Heritage Streetcar]] service, under the same name.

====Cycling====
Bicycling is a popular and viable means of transportation in Fort Collins. There are more than {{convert|280|mi|km}} of designated bikeways in Fort Collins, including on-street designated bike lanes, and the Spring Creek and Poudre River Trails, both paved. There is also a dirt trail, the {{convert|5.8|mi|km|adj=on}} Foothills Trail, parallel to Horsetooth Reservoir from Dixon Reservoir north to Campeau Open Space and Michaud Lane.

The Fort Collins Bicycle Library lends bicycles to visitors, students, and residents looking to explore the city of Fort Collins.
