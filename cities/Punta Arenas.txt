'''Punta Arenas''' ({{IPA|es|ˈpunta aˈɾenas}}, historically known as '''Sandy Point''' in English) is the capital [[List of cities in Chile|city]] of [[Chile]]'s southernmost [[Regions of Chile|region]], [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes and Antarctica Chilena]]. Although officially renamed as '''Magallanes''' in 1927, the name was changed back to Punta Arenas in 1938. The city is the largest south of the [[46th parallel south]] and the most populous southernmost [[List of cities in Chile|city in Chile]] and the [[Americas]]. Due to its location, it is also the coldest coastal city with more than 100,000 inhabitants in [[Latin America]]. Punta Arenas is one of the world's most southerly ports and serves as an [[Antarctic Gateway Cities|Antarctic gateway city]]. Punta Arenas is the world's southernmost city with more than 100,000 inhabitants and claims the title of southernmost city in the world, although this title is also claimed by [[Ushuaia]] in Argentina, which lies farther south but is slightly smaller than Punta Arenas.

Since 1977, Punta Arenas has been one of only two [[List of free ports|free ports]] in Chile, the other being [[Iquique]] in the country's far north.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://diario.latercera.com/2012/04/01/01/contenido/negocios/27-105200-9-zona-franca-de-aysen-tendra-caracteristicas-similares-a-las-de-iquique-y-punta.shtml |title= Zona franca de Aysén tendrá características similares a las de Iquique y Punta Arenas| trans-title= Aysén free zone will have characteristics similar to those of Iquique and Punta Arenas| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140422031606/http://diario.latercera.com/2012/04/01/01/contenido/negocios/27-105200-9-zona-franca-de-aysen-tendra-caracteristicas-similares-a-las-de-iquique-y-punta.shtml |archivedate= 22 April 2014 | work= [[La Tercera]]| date= 1 April 2012| language= es| access-date= }}</ref>{{efn-ua|Punta Arenas itself is not a "free port": Outside the city there is a "zona franca" where certain products can be imported into the country under a reduced-tax regime.}} Located on the [[Brunswick Peninsula]] north of the [[Strait of Magellan]], Punta Arenas was originally established by the Chilean government in 1848 as a small [[penal colony]] to assert sovereignty over the Strait. During the remainder of the 1800s, Punta Arenas grew in size and importance due to the increasing maritime traffic and trade travelling to the west coasts of South and North America. This city's growth was also due to waves of European immigrants, mainly from [[Croatia]] and [[Russia]], attracted by a [[Tierra del Fuego gold rush|gold rush]] and [[Patagonian sheep farming boom|sheep farming boom]] in the 1880s and early 1900s. The largest sheep company, which controlled 10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina, was based in Punta Arenas, and its owners lived there.

Since its founding, Chile has used Punta Arenas as a base to defend its sovereignty claims in the southernmost part of South America. This led to the Strait of Magellan being recognized as Chilean territory in the [[Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]]. Punta Arenas' geopolitical importance has remained high in the 20th and 21st centuries due to its logistic significance in accessing the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

Since 2017, the city and its region have been on their [[Time in Chile#Time zones|own time zone]], using summer time throughout the year (UTC−3). The city is supplied with water from the [[San Juan River (Chile)|San Juan River]].<ref name="BCNhidro">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bcn.cl/siit/nuestropais/region12/hidrografia.htm |title=Hidrografía Región de Magallanes |access-date=2022-03-02 |website= bcn.cl| publisher= Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile |language=es}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Punta Arenas'' whose literal translation would be "Point Sands", is actually derived from the Spanish term ''Punta Arenosa'', a literal translation of the English name "Sandy Point".

The name Sandy Point derives from the [[English expedition to Valdivia|voyage of John Narborough]] in 1669-1671. He wrote in his account:

{{Quote|Sand-Point [sic] is a mean low Point, lies out more than the other Points of the shore, and a few trees grow on it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmundson |first1= William |title=A History of the British Presence in Chile: From Bloody Mary to Charles Darwin and the Decline of British Influence |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|isbn=9780230101210 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVjCAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA115 |access-date=3 July 2019}}</ref>}}

The English 18th-century explorer [[John Byron]] is sometimes erroneously credited with naming this area.

The city has also been known as ''Magallanes''. Today that term is normally used to describe the administrative region which includes the city.

Punta Arenas has been nicknamed "the city of the red roofs" for the red-painted metal roofs that characterized the city for many years. Since about 1970, the availability of other colours in protective finishes has resulted in greater variety in the characteristic metal roofs.

==Geography==
Located on the [[Brunswick Peninsula]], Punta Arenas is among the largest cities in [[Patagonia]]. In 2012, it had a population of 127,454.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ine.cl/ine/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/censo2002/mapa_interactivo/mapa_interactivo.htm |title= Interactive map, INE Census 2002, Chile| website= ine.cl| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061120051028/http://www.ine.cl/ine/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/censo2002/mapa_interactivo/mapa_interactivo.htm |archivedate= 20 November 2006 }} (Click on XII Region and then on Punta Arenas)</ref> It is roughly {{cvt|1,419|km}} from the coast of Antarctica and {{cvt|635|km}} from [[Ushuaia]], the capital of the Argentine province of [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra Del Fuego]].

The Magallanes region is considered part of Chilean [[Patagonia]]. Magallanes is Spanish for [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]], and was named after Ferdinand Magellan, the Portuguese explorer sailing for [[Spain]]. While circumnavigating the Earth for Spain, he passed close to the present site of Punta Arenas in 1520. Early English navigational documents referred to this site as "Sandy Point."

The city proper is located on the northeastern shore of Brunswick Peninsula. Except for the eastern shore, containing the settlements of Guairabo, Rio Amarillo and Punta San Juan, the peninsula is largely uninhabited. The municipality of Punta Arenas includes all of Brunswick Peninsula, as well as all islands west of the ''[[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]]'' and north of [[Cockburn Channel|Cockburn]] and [[Magdalena Channel|Magdalena]] channels.

The largest of those are:
* [[Santa Inés Island]]
* [[Desolación Island]]
* [[Dawson Island]]
* [[Aracena Island]]
* [[Clarence Island, Chile|Clarence Island]]
* ''Carlos Island''
* ''Wickham Island''

Except [[Dawson Island]], which had a population of about 301 in 2002, the islands are largely uninhabited. [[Clarence Island, Chile|Clarence Island]] had a population of five.

===Climate===
[[File:Punta Arenas con nieve.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Snow in winter]]

Due to its far southern latitude, Punta Arenas has a [[subpolar oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfc''). The seasonal temperature in Punta Arenas is greatly moderated by its proximity to the ocean, with average lows in July near {{cvt|-1|°C|°F}} and highs in January of {{convert|14|°C|°F}}.
It is known for stable constant temperatures, which vary only slightly with the seasons. Rainfall is highest in April and May, and the snowy season runs all through the Chilean winter (June until September). As in most of [[Patagonia]], average annual precipitation is quite low, only {{cvt|15|in|mm|order=flip}} because of a [[rain shadow]] created by the Andes. The average temperature does not go below {{cvt|1|°C|°F}}.<ref name="Punta Arenas article">{{cite web| url= http://www.letsgochile.com/locations/patagonial/magallanes-xii/punta-arenas |title= Punta Arenas |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090227150806/http://www.letsgochile.com/locations/patagonial/magallanes-xii/punta-arenas |archivedate= 27 February 2009 |website= Letsgochile.com| publisher= | date= | access-date= }}</ref> The city is also known for its strong winds (up to {{cvt|130|km/h|disp=sqbr}}), which are strongest during the summer. City officials have put up ropes between buildings in the downtown area to assist pedestrians with managing the strong downdrafts.{{citation needed|reason=A source that corroborates the officials putting up ropes is needed|date=November 2015}}

Since 1986, Punta Arenas has been the first significantly populated city in the world to be affected directly by the thinning [[ozone layer]]. Its residents are considered to be exposed to potentially damaging levels of [[ultraviolet radiation]].<ref name=NYT03Mar95>{{cite web |author= Calvin Sims |date=3 March 1995 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/world/punta-arenas-journal-a-hole-in-the-heavens-chicken-little-below.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FScience%2FTopics%2FAir%20Pollution |title= Punta Arenas Journal; A Hole in the Heavens (Chicken Little Below?) |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=16 May 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510143528/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/world/punta-arenas-journal-a-hole-in-the-heavens-chicken-little-below.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FScience%2FTopics%2FAir%20Pollution |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=live }}{{update after|2013|8}}{{update inline|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref name= PPPv18i6>{{Cite journal

==History==
{{see also|Spanish colonization attempt of the Strait of Magellan}}
[[File:Casa España, Punta Arenas, Magallanes, Chile.jpg|thumb|Casa España, established in 1917 by the ''Spanish Society of Socorros Mutuos''. It was formed between 1936 and 1938. Plaza de Armas ([[Muñoz Gamero Park]]).]]

[[File:Avenida Cristóbal Colón, Punta Arenas, Magallanes, Chile.jpg|thumb|Christopher Columbus Avenue, the location of the Old Machine House was built in 1890 by Croatians.]]

Two early [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] settlements were attempted along this coast (on the Straits of Magellan). The first was founded in 1584 and was called ''Nombre de Jesús.'' It failed due to the harsh weather and difficulty in the settlers' obtaining food and water, and the enormous distances from other Spanish ports. A second colony, ''Ciudad del Rey don Felipe'', was attempted about 80 kilometres south of Punta Arenas. This became known later as ''[[Puerto del Hambre]]'', which translates to ''Port Famine''. Spain had established these settlements in an attempt to protect its shipping and prevent piracy by [[English people|English]] [[Pirate|pirates]], by controlling the Straits of Magellan. An English [[privateer]], [[Thomas Cavendish]], during his [[Thomas Cavendish's circumnavigation|circumnavigation]], rescued the last surviving member of Puerto del Hambre in 1587.<ref>Martinic, Mateo, (2000) Rey don Felipe: Historical facts (in Spanish).

===Penal colony===
{{further|Chilean colonization of the Strait of Magellan}}
In 1843 the [[Chilean government]] sent an expedition to build a fort and establish a permanent settlement on the shores of the Strait of Magellan. It built and commissioned a schooner called ''Goleta Ancud.'' Under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], Chilean Navy, it transported a crew of 21 people ([[captain (naval)|captain]], eighteen crew, and two women), plus cargo, to accomplish the mandate. The founding act of the settlement took place on 21 September 1843.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Braun-Menéndez |first1=Armando |year=1968 |title=Fuerte Bulnes: Colección Cruz del Sur; 10 |language=es |publisher=Francisco de Aguirre |edition=2nd |url=https://www.amazon.com/Fuerte-Bulnes----Biblioteca-Francisco-Aguirre/dp/B00OTVV6FE/ref=sr_1_3_twi_har_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1449783635&sr=1-3&keywords=Fuerte+Bulnes}}</ref>

The fort was well-positioned on a small rocky [[peninsula]], but the location could not support a proper civilian settlement. With this in mind the Military Governor, José de los Santos Mardones, decided in 1848 to move the settlement to its current location, along the ''Las Minas'' river, and renamed it Punta Arenas.

In the mid-19th century, Chile used Punta Arenas as a penal colony and a disciplinary posting for military personnel with "problematic" behaviour. It also settled immigrants there. In December 1851, a prisoners' [[Mutiny of Cambiazo|mutiny led by Lieutenant Cambiaso]], resulted in the murder of Governor Muñoz Gamero and the priest, and the destruction of the church and the hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interpatagonia.com/puntaarenas/historia_i.html |title=Punta Arenas, History and Legends |publisher=Interpatagonia.com |access-date=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419151046/http://www.interpatagonia.com/puntaarenas/historia_i.html |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The mutiny was put down by [[William Houston Stewart|Commander Stewart]] of {{HMS|Virago|1842|6}} assisted by two Chilean ships: ''Indefatigable'' and ''[[Meteoro (brigantine)|Meteoro]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=2260 |title=History HMS ''Virago'' |publisher=Pdavis.nl |access-date=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415022651/http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=2260 |archive-date=15 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://patlibros.org/iam/index.php |title= Brown, Charles H., "Insurrection at Magellan.

In 1867, President [[José Joaquín Pérez]] issued a decree offering land grants in an effort to get Chileans or foreigners to settle around Punta Arenas.  The first British immigrants arrived in 1867, and their number increased as [[sheep farming]] grew in the [[Magallanes Region|Chilean Magallanes]].  The greatest immigration continued to be by the British until 1906, when Croatians surpassed them in numbers.<ref name=William>{{cite book |last1=Edmundson |first1=William |title=A History of the British Presence in Chile: From Bloody Mary to Charles Darwin and the Decline of British Influence |url=https://archive.org/details/historybritishpr00edmu |url-access=limited |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |location=New York |isbn=9780230114838 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historybritishpr00edmu/page/n129 117]-125}}</ref>

An 1877 mutiny, known as ''El motín de los artilleros'' (Mutiny of the Artillerymen), led to the destruction of a large part of the town and the murder of many civilians not directly associated with the prison. In time the city was restored. The growth of the sheep farming industry and the [[Tierra del Fuego Gold Rush|discovery of gold]], as well as increasing trade via sailing ships, attracted many new settlers, and the town began to prosper.

===Economic boom===
Between about 1890 and 1940, the [[Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes region]] became an important sheep-raising region, with one company (''[[Sociedad Explotadora de Tierra del Fuego]]'') controlling over {{convert|11000|km2}}.  In 1910, Sociedad Explotadora merged with Sociedad Ganadera, resulting in a company possessing 3 million [[hectare]]s in southern Chile and Argentina, with over 2 million head of sheep.<ref name=William/>{{rp|120–125}}  The headquarters of this company and the residences of the owners were in Punta Arenas. The Sarah Braun Museum is now established at the former Braun-Menéndez mansion, in the centre of Punta Arenas.

The Punta Arenas harbour, although exposed to storms, was considered one of the most important in Chile before the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. It was used as a [[coaling station]] by the [[steamships]] transiting between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Today it is mostly used by tourism cruises and scientific expeditions.

===Modern city===
The city is often a base for Antarctic expeditions; [[Ushuaia]] (Argentina) and [[Christchurch]] (New Zealand) are also common starting points.<ref>[http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=391&sid=1298418 Punta Arenas example] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219211609/http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=391&sid=1298418 |date=19 February 2008 }}<br /> [http://www.cruise-reviews.com/reviews/destinations/destinationdetail2.asp?fReviewID=180 Ushuaiaexample] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219180536/http://www.cruise-reviews.com/reviews/destinations/destinationdetail2.asp?fReviewID=180 |date=19 February 2008 }}<br /> [https://www.responsibletravel.com/holiday/2671/antarctica-holiday-classic-cruise Ushuaiaexample] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208123432/http://www.responsibletravel.com/Trip/Trip101420.htm |date=8 February 2008 }}<br /> [http://www.smallgrouptours.net/Antarctica_Classic.html Ushuaiaexample] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220072235/http://www.smallgrouptours.net/Antarctica_Classic.html |date=20 February 2008 }}<br /> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3683431.stm "New Zealand is still the jumping-off point for today's expeditions to Antarctica, and the home of several Antarctic research institutes."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826070920/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3683431.stm |date=26 August 2008 }}, BBC News<br /> [http://www.pacificislandbooks.com/antarctica.htm "Christchurch... is still the major jumping off point for Antarctica.

In 2012 Punta Arenas recorded a population of over 127,000 inhabitants for the (2012 Census) by the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]]. The population grew by 5.1% (5,830 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses and further rose to 127,454 at the 2012 Census.<ref name="INE"/>

The city was populated by many colonists from [[Spain]] and [[Croatian Chilean|Croatia]] in the mid-nineteenth century, and many of their descendants remain. Other national ethnic groups represented are [[German Chilean|German]], [[English Chilean|English]], [[Italian Chilean|Italian]], [[Swiss Chilean|Swiss]] and [[Irish Chilean|Irish]].

[[Croatian people|Croatian immigration]] to Punta Arenas was a crucial development in the region of [[Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes]] and the city in particular. Currently, this influence is still reflected in the names of shops, streets and many buildings. Punta Arenas is said to have the largest percentage of Croatians in the world outside Croatia and the former Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Punta Arenas also has the largest percentage of residents of British descent in the whole of Chile.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} 

Punta Arenas is home to the southernmost Hindu temple in the world, which is used by the relatively small, but significant, [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] community in Punta Arenas. Sindhi merchants began arriving in the area during the early 1900s, and today constitute one of the largest communities of [[Indians in Chile]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-08-02|title=Keeping cultures alive: Sindhis and Hindus in Chile|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/keeping-cultures-alive-sindhis-and-hindus-in-chile/story-SArpBs0aDiHbhOXqjazqIP.html|access-date=2021-12-30|website=Hindustan Times|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Haksar|first=Nandita|title=Punta Arenas: Did you know of the Chilean town where a Sindhi man set up a business outpost in 1905?|url=https://scroll.in/article/883496/punta-arenas-did-you-know-of-the-chilean-town-where-a-sindhi-set-up-a-business-outpost|access-date=2021-12-30|website=Scroll.in|language=en-US}}</ref>

Agricultural production, including sheep and cattle, continues to play a significant role.

Tourism has contributed to the city's economy and steady growth. Tourist destinations include the Cathedral and other notable churches, the city cemetery, and the statue of Magellan. Some cruise ships to Antarctica depart from Punta Arenas's port, which also serves as a hub for many cruise lines that travel along the channels and fjords of the region.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

A scheduled ferry service connects Punta Arenas with the main island of [[Tierra del Fuego]], and a less frequent ferry runs to the Chilean town of [[Puerto Williams]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
