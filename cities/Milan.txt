Milan was founded with the Celtic name of Medhelanon,<ref name="Tellier"/><ref name="cronologia"/> later [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] by the [[ancient Romans]] into [[Mediolanum]]. In [[Celtic language]] ''medhe-'' meant "middle, centre" and the name element ''-lanon'' is the Celtic equivalent of Latin ''-planum'' "plain", meant "(settlement) in the midst of the plain",<ref>{{cite book |last= Delamarre |first= Xavier |title= Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise |url= https://archive.org/details/dictionnairedela00dela_348 |url-access= limited |edition= 2nd |year= 2003 |publisher= Errance |location= Paris |isbn= 2-87772-237-6 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dictionnairedela00dela_348/page/n219 221]–222 |language= fr}}</ref><ref name="Quintela">{{cite journal|first=Marco|last=García Quintela|title=Celtic Elements in Northwestern Spain in Pre-Roman times"|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies|year=2005|quote=[...] a toponym, clearly in the second part of the composite Medio-lanum (=Milan), meaning 'plain' or flat area [...]}}</ref> or of "place between watercourses" (Celtic ''medhe'' = "in the middle, central"; ''land'' or ''lan'' = "land"), given the presence of the [[Olona]], [[Lambro]], [[Seveso (river)|Seveso]] rivers and the Nirone and Pudiga streams.<ref name="CraccoRuggini17">L.Cracco Ruggini, ''Milano da "metropoli" degli [[Insubri]] a capitale d'Impero: una vicenda di mille anni'', in Catalogo della Mostra "''Milano capitale dell'Impero romani (286-402 d.C.)''", edited by Gemma Sena Chiesa, Milano, 1990, p.17.</ref>

The [[Ancient Rome|Latin]] name ''[[Mediolanum]]'' comes from the Latin words ''medio'' (in the middle) and ''planus'' (plain).<ref>{{cite book|last= Ambrogio|first= Renzo|title= Nomi d'Italia : origine e significato dei nomi geografici e di tutti i comuni|year= 2009|publisher= Istituto geografico De Agostini|location= Novara|isbn= 978-88-511-1412-1|page= 385}}</ref> However, some scholars believe that ''lanum'' comes from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] root ''lan'', meaning an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''[[Llan (placename)|llan]]'', meaning "a sanctuary or church", ultimately cognate to English/German ''Land'') in which Celtic communities used to build shrines.<ref>{{cite book|last= Wise|first= Hilary|title= The vocabulary of modern French origins, structure and function|year= 1997|publisher= Routledge|location= London|isbn= 0-203-42979-6|page= 39}}</ref>

Hence ''Mediolanum'' could signify the central town or sanctuary of a Celtic tribe. Indeed, about sixty Gallo-Roman sites in France bore the name "Mediolanum", for example: [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] (''[[Mediolanum Santonum]]'') and [[Évreux]] (''[[Mediolanum Aulercorum]]'').<ref>{{cite book|last= Michell|first= John|title= The sacred center: the ancient art of locating sanctuaries|year= 2009|publisher= Inner Traditions|location= Rochester, Vt.|isbn= 978-1-59477-284-9|page= 32}}</ref> In addition, another theory links the name to the ''[[scrofa semilanuta]]'' ("half-woolly sow") an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''Emblemata'' (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of ''Mediolanum'' given as "half-wool",<ref>''medius'' + ''lanum''; Alciato's "etymology" is intentionally far-fetched.</ref> explained in Latin and in French.

According to this theory, the foundation of Milan is credited to two [[Celts|Celtic peoples]], the [[Bituriges Cubi|Bituriges]] and the [[Aedui]], having as their [[emblem]]s a ram and a boar;<ref>''Bituricis vervex, Heduis dat sucula signum.''</ref> therefore "The [[Symbols of Milan|city's symbol]] is a wool-bearing boar, an animal of double form, here with sharp bristles, there with sleek wool."<ref>''Laniger huic signum sus est, animálque biforme, Acribus hinc setis, lanitio inde levi.''</ref> Alciato credits [[Ambrose]] for his account.<ref>{{cite web

=== Celtic era ===
[[File:9754 - Museo archeologico di Milano - Olletta celtica (sec. II-I a.C.) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 13-mar-2012.jpg|thumb|Celtic finds dating back to the period preceding the Roman conquest (3rd-2nd century BC), which is preserved in the [[Archaeological Museum, Milan|Civic Archaeological Museum of Milan]]]]

Around 590 BC<ref name="cronologia"/> a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe belonging to the [[Insubre]]s group and belonging to the [[Golasecca culture]] settled the city under the name Medhelanon.<ref name="Tellier"/><ref name="cronologia"/> According to the legend reported by [[Livy]] (writing between 27 and 9 BC), the [[Gaul]]ish king [[Ambicatus]] sent his nephew [[Bellovesus]] into northern Italy at the head of a party drawn from various Gaulish tribes; Bellovesus allegedly founded the settlement in the times of the Roman monarchy, during the reign of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus|Tarquinius Priscus]]. Tarquin is traditionally recorded as reigning from 616 to 579 BC, according to ancient Roman historian Titus Livy.<ref>Livius, ''[[Ab Urbe condita]]'' 5.34–35.3.</ref>

Medhelanon, in particular, was developed around a [[sanctuary]], which was the oldest area of the village.<ref name="Tosi">{{cite book|first=Stefano|last=Tosi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofosDAAAQBAJ&dq=fossato+celtico+via+moneta+milano&pg=PA27|title=Da Milano alla Barona. Storia, luoghi e persone di questa terra|date=2 May 2016 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-326-64414-7 |access-date=16 July 2018|language=it}}</ref> The sanctuary, which consisted of a wooded area in the shape of an ellipse with a central clearing, was aligned according to precise astronomical points. For this reason, it was used for religious gatherings, especially in particular celebratory moments. The sanctuary of Medhelanon was an ellipse with axes of {{convert|443|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|323|m|abbr=on}} located near [[Piazza della Scala]].<ref name="Tosi"/> The urban planning profile was based on these early paths, and on the shape of the sanctuary, reached, in some cases, up to the 19th century and even beyond. For example, the route of the modern Corso Vittorio Emanuele, [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan|Piazza del Duomo]], [[Piazza Cordusio]] and Via Broletto, which is curvilinear, could correspond to the south side of the ellipse of the ancient sanctuary of Medhelanon.<ref name="Tosi"/>

One axis of the Medhelanon sanctuary was aligned towards the [[heliacal rising]] of [[Antares]], while the other towards the heliacal rising of [[Capella]]. The latter coincided with a Celtic spring festival celebrated on 24 March, while the heliacal rising of Antares corresponded with 11 November, which opened and closed the Celtic year and which coincided with the point where the Sun rose on the winter [[solstice]].<ref name="Tosi"/> About two centuries after the creation of the Celtic sanctuary, the first residential settlements began to be built around it. Medhelanon then transformed from a simple religious center to an urban and then military centre, thus becoming a real village.<ref name="Tosi"/>

The first homes were built just south of the Celtic sanctuary, near the modern [[Royal Palace of Milan]].<ref name="Tosi"/> Subsequently, with the growth of the town centre, other important buildings for the Medhelanon community were built. First, a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Belisama]] was built, which was located near the modern [[Milan Cathedral]]. Then, near the modern Via Moneta, which is located near today's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]], a fortified building with military functions was built which was surrounded by a defensive moat.<ref name="Tosi"/>

The ancient Celtic settlement was, from a [[Topography|topographic]] point of view, superimposed and replaced by the Roman one. The Roman city was then gradually superimposed and replaced by the medieval one. The urban center of Milan has therefore grown constantly and rapidly, until modern times, around the first Celtic nucleus. The original Celtic toponym Medhelanon then changed, as evidenced by a graffiti in Celtic language present on a section of the Roman walls of Milan which dates back to a period following the Roman conquest of the Celtic village, in Mesiolano.<ref name="romanoimpero">{{cite web|url=https://www.romanoimpero.com/2010/07/mediolanum-milano-lombardia.html|title=Mediolanum-Milano|access-date=8 July 2018|language=it}}</ref> In 286, the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] moved the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from Rome to Mediolanum.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/16_febbraio_12/antica-mediolanum-rivive-computer-milano-romana-circo-anfiteatro-urbanfile-blog-66026574-d1af-11e5-9819-2c2b53be318b.shtml |title=Video of Roman Milan |access-date=24 November 2018 |archive-date=5 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505073359/http://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/16_febbraio_12/antica-mediolanum-rivive-computer-milano-romana-circo-anfiteatro-urbanfile-blog-66026574-d1af-11e5-9819-2c2b53be318b.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Diocletian himself chose to reside at [[Nicomedia]] in the Eastern Empire, leaving his colleague [[Maximian]] at Milan.

During the Augustan age Mediolanum was famous for its schools; it possessed a theatre and an [[Milan amphitheatre|amphitheatre]] (129.5 x 109.3 m), the third largest in [[Roman Italy]] after the [[Colosseum]] in Rome and the vast amphitheatre in [[Capua]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Herbert W. |last=Benario |title=Amphitheatres of the Roman World |journal=The Classical Journal |volume=76 |issue=3 |year=1981 |pages=255–258 |jstor=3297328 }} </ref> A large stone wall encircled the city in Caesar's time, and later was expanded in the late third century AD, by [[Maximian]]. Maximian built several gigantic monuments including the large [[Roman circus|circus]] (470 × 85 metres) and the ''[[thermae]]'' or [[Baths of Hercules]], a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which few visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area to 375 acres by surrounding it with a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5&nbsp;km long) with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; the one included later in the construction of the convent of [[San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore|San Maurizio Maggiore]] remains 16.6 m high.

It was from Mediolanum that the [[Emperor Constantine]] issued what is now known as the [[Edict of Milan]] in AD 313, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, thus paving the way for Christianity to become the dominant religion of the Empire. Constantine was in Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, [[Licinius]]. In 402, the [[Visigoths]] besieged the city and the [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] moved the Imperial residence to [[Ravenna]].<ref>Compare:

The [[Lombards]] took [[Ticinum]] as their capital in 572 (renaming it ''Papia'' – the modern [[Pavia]]), and left [[Early Middle Ages|early-medieval]] Milan to the governance of its [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|archbishops]].

The 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. City-states emerged in northern Italy, an expression of the new political power of the cities and their will to fight against all feudal powers. Milan was no exception. It did not take long, however, for the Italian city-states to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017|archive-date=29 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429093826/http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|url-status=live}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] for help.

Following this economic growth, works such as the [[Sforza Castle]] (already existing in the Visconti era under the name of Porta Giovia Castle, but re-adapted, enlarged and completed by the Sforza family) and the [[Policlinico of Milan|Ospedale Maggiore]] were completed. The Sforzas also managed to attract to Milan personalities such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who redesigned and improved the function of the [[navigli]] and painted ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', and [[Bramante]], who worked on the [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro|church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro]], on the [[basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] and to the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan|church of Santa Maria delle Grazie]], influencing the development of the [[Renaissance in Lombardy|Lombard Renaissance]].

[[Image:1807KingdomItaly.jpg|thumb|Highlighted in yellow, the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]], which had Milan as its capital]]
Milan's last independent ruler, [[Lodovico il Moro]], requested the aid of [[Charles VIII of France]] against the other [[Italian states]], eventually unleashing the [[Italian Wars]]. The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orléans]], took part in the expedition and realized most of Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor François I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[François I of France|François I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated François I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], which included Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>

In 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629–1631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629–31, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']]. This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>

In 1700, the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713–1714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan. [[Napoleon]] invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned King of Italy in the [[Milan Cathedral|cathedral]]. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy and Milan, to Austrian control in 1815.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/regno-lombardo-veneto/|title=Lombardo-Veneto, Regno|access-date=29 October 2023|publisher=[[Treccani]]|language=it}}</ref>

=== Late modern and contemporary ===
[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the "[[Five Days of Milan]]" (18–22 March 1848) uprising against Austrian rule]]

On 18 March 1848 Milan effectively rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called "[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]" ({{langx|it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Piedmont–Sardinia]] sent troops to protect the insurgents and organised a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont–Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy. About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]], [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]] were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name="Solferino">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J. Morris |url=http://www.battlefieldanomalies.com/solferino/08_the_battle.htm |access-date=9 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630084539/http://www.battlefieldanomalies.com/solferino/08_the_battle.htm |archive-date=30 June 2009}}</ref> Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into Piedmont-Sardinia, which then proceeded to annex all the other Italian statlets and proclaim the birth of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on 17 March 1861.

The political [[unification of Italy]] enhanced Milan's economic dominance over northern Italy. A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lastampa.it/verbano-cusio-ossola/2012/06/15/news/orient-express-quando-tra-londra-e-costantinopoli-c-erano-le-fermate-a-stresa-e-pallanza-1.36470455/#:~:text=Visto%20il%20successo%2C%20nel%201919,il%20simbolo%20della%20Belle%20%C3%89poque|title=Orient Express, quando tra Londra e Costantinopoli c'erano le fermate a Stresa e Pallanza|date=15 June 2012 |access-date=29 October 2023|language=it}}</ref> Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. In May 1898, Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilpost.it/2018/05/08/bava-beccaris-moti-milano/|title=Le cannonate di Bava Beccaris, 120 anni fa|date=8 May 2018 |access-date=29 October 2023|language=it}}</ref>

Milan's northern location in Italy closer to Europe, secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that [[Benito Mussolini]] built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist [[Blackshirts]] rallied for the first time in the city's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]]; here the future [[Fascist]] dictator launched his [[March on Rome]] on 28 October 1922.

During the post-war economic boom, the reconstruction effort and the [[Italian economic miracle]] attracted a large wave of internal migration (especially from rural areas of [[southern Italy]]) to Milan. The population grew from 1.3&nbsp;million in 1951 to 1.7&nbsp;million in 1967.<ref name="Ginsborg">{{cite book|last= Ginsborg|first= Paul|title= A history of contemporary Italy: society and politics, 1943 – 1988|year= 2003|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|location= New York|isbn= 1-4039-6153-0|page=220}}</ref> During this period, Milan was rapidly rebuilt, with the construction of several innovative and modernist skyscrapers, such as the [[Torre Velasca]] and the [[Pirelli Tower]], that soon became the symbols of this new era of prosperity.<ref name="Foot">{{Cite book |last=Foot |first=John |title=Milan since the miracle: city, culture, and identity |publisher=Berg |year=2001 |isbn=1-85973-545-2 |location=New York |page=119}}</ref> The economic prosperity was, however, overshadowed in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the so-called [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of lead]], when Milan witnessed an unprecedented wave of street violence, [[labour strike]]s and [[political terrorism]]. The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when [[Piazza Fontana bombing|a bomb]] exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing 17 people and injuring 88.
[[File:Expo2015Milano-Cardo.JPG|thumb|[[Expo 2015]], which took place in Milan]]
In the 1980s, with the international success of Milanese houses (like [[Armani]], [[Prada]], [[Versace]], [[Moschino]] and [[Dolce & Gabbana]]), Milan became one of the world's fashion capitals. The city saw also a marked rise in [[international tourism]], notably from America and Japan, while the stock exchange increased its market capitalisation more than five-fold.<ref>{{cite web|title=Italian Stock Exchange – Main indicators 1975–2012|url=http://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsaitaliana/ufficio-stampa/dati-storici/principaliindicatori2012_pdf.htm|access-date=16 October 2012|archive-date=6 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106211102/https://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsaitaliana/ufficio-stampa/dati-storici/principaliindicatori2012_pdf.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> This period led the mass media to nickname the metropolis ''"Milano da bere"'', literally "Milan to be drunk".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/cultura/200804articoli/31497girata.asp |title=L'uomo che inventò la Milano da bere |publisher=Lastampa.It |date=4 January 2008 |access-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914065500/http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/cultura/200804articoli/31497girata.asp |archive-date=14 September 2009}}</ref> But in the 1990s Milan was badly affected by [[Tangentopoli]], a political scandal in which many politicians and businessmen were tried for corruption.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Milano Santa Maria delle Grazie ogrod.jpg|thumb|The cloister of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] in the spring of 2010]]
Milan features a mid-latitude, four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Milan's climate is similar to much of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot, humid summers and cold, foggy winters. The [[Alps]] and [[Apennine Mountains]] form a natural barrier that protects the city from the major circulations coming from northern Europe and the sea.<ref>{{cite web|title=The ENVIBASE-Project – Climate of Milan|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/archiv_sensut/umwelt/uisonline/envibase/handbook/climate3.htm|access-date=14 August 2012|archive-date=28 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228142756/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/archiv_sensut/umwelt/uisonline/envibase/handbook/climate3.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

During winter daily average temperatures can fall below freezing ({{cvt|0|C|disp=sqbr}}) and accumulations of snow can occur: the historic average of Milan's area is {{convert|25|cm|0}} in the period between 1961 and 1990, with a record of {{convert|90|cm|0}} in January 1985.

The city was often shrouded in thick cloud or fog during winter, although the removal of rice paddies from the southern neighbourhoods and the [[urban heat island]] effect have greatly reduced this occurrence since the turn of the 21st century.

The municipality of Milan is subdivided into nine administrative Borough Councils (''Consigli di Municipio''), down from the former twenty districts before the 1999 administrative reform.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Borough Councils of Milan|url=http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/CDM?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/ContentLibrary/In%20Comune/In%20Comune/I%20Consigli%20di%20Zona|publisher=Municipality of Milan|access-date=18 October 2012|archive-date=18 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418043458/http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/CDM?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fwps%2Fwcm%2Fconnect%2FContentLibrary%2FIn%20Comune%2FIn%20Comune%2FI%20Consigli%20di%20Zona|url-status=live}}</ref> Each Borough Council is governed by a Council (''Consiglio'') and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor.

=== Regional government ===
Milan is also the capital of [[Lombardy]], one of the twenty [[Regions of Italy|regions]] of Italy. Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. It is governed by a Regional Council, composed of 80 members elected for a five-year term. On 26 March 2018, a list of candidates of the [[Centre-right coalition (Italy)|centre-right coalition]], a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Attilio Fontana, largely won the regional election, defeating a coalition of socialists, liberals and ecologists and a third-party candidate from the populist [[Five Stars Movement]]. The conservatives have governed the region almost uninterruptedly since 1970. The regional council has 48 members from the centre-right coalition, 18 from the [[Centre-left coalition (Italy)|centre-left coalition]] and 13 from the Five Star Movement. The seat of the regional government is [[Palazzo Lombardia]] that, standing at {{convert|161.3|m|abbr=off}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Awards/AllPastWinners/12_PalazzoLombardia/tabid/3360/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|access-date=18 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027145405/http://ctbuh.org/Awards/AllPastWinners/12_PalazzoLombardia/tabid/3360/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|archive-date=27 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> is the fifth-tallest building in Milan.

The [[History of architecture and art in Milan|architectural and artistic presence in Milan]] represents one of the attractions of the Lombard capital. Milan has been among the most important Italian centers in the [[history of architecture]], has made important contributions to the development of art history, and has been the cradle of a number of [[modern art]] movements.

There are only few remains of the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, notably the well-preserved [[Colonne di San Lorenzo]]. During the second half of the 4th century, [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, reshaping the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built in Roman times are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates: [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Sant'Ambrogio]], [[San Nazaro in Brolo]], [[Basilica of San Simpliciano|San Simpliciano]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio|Sant'Eustorgio]], which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan. [[Duomo di Milano|Milan's Cathedral]], built between 1386 and 1877, is the largest church in the Italian Republic—the larger [[St. Peter's Basilica]] is in the [[State of Vatican City]], a sovereign state—and the [[List of largest churches|third largest in the world]],<ref name="ReferenceA"/> as well as the most important example of [[Gothic architecture]] in Italy. The gilt bronze statue of the [[Madonnina (statue)|Virgin Mary]], placed in 1774 on the highest pinnacle of the Duomo, soon became one of the most enduring [[symbols of Milan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Sharon|title=A perfect trip to Italy in the golden years.|year=2011|publisher=iUniverse Inc.|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4502-8443-1|page=93}}</ref>

In the 15th century, when the [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] ruled the city, an old Viscontean fortress was enlarged and embellished to become the [[Sforza Castle|Castello Sforzesco]], the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park. Notable architects involved in the project included the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Filarete]], who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milanocastello.it/ing/lungaRicostruito.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830184307/http://www.milanocastello.it/ing/lungaRicostruito.html |archive-date=30 August 2003 |title=The Castle Reconstructed by the Sforza |website=Castello Sforzesco website}}</ref> The alliance between Francesco Sforza and Florence's [[Cosimo de' Medici]] bore to Milan Tuscan models of Renaissance architecture, apparent in the [[Ospedale Maggiore]] and Bramante's work in the city, which includes [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]] (a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the tribune of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] and three cloisters for Sant'Ambrogio.<ref name="murray"/> The [[Counter-Reformation]] in the 16th to 17th centuries was also the period of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish domination]] and was marked by two powerful figures: [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]] and his cousin, [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Federico Borromeo]]. Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]], in a building designed by [[Francesco Maria Richini]], and the nearby [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]]. Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, [[Pellegrino Tibaldi]], [[Galeazzo Alessi]] and Richini himself.<ref name="Wittkower"/>

Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was responsible for the significant renovations carried out in Milan during the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Reill|editor-first=Peter Hanns|last=Wilson|first=Ellen Judy|title=Encyclopedia of the enlightenment|year=2004|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-8160-5335-9|page=392|edition=Rev.}}</ref> This urban and artistic renewal included the establishment of [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]], inaugurated in 1778, and the renovation of the [[Royal Palace of Milan|Royal Palace]].

Hoepli|location=Milano|isbn=88-203-3092-X|page=324}}</ref> The massive [[Arch of Peace]], situated at the bottom of Corso Sempione, is often compared to the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris. In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial centre of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London. Several other arcades such as the [[Galleria del Corso]], built between 1923 and 1931, complement it. Another late-19th-century eclectic monument in the city is the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] graveyard, built in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] style between 1863 and 1866.

The tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture. [[Art Nouveau]], also known as ''[[Liberty style|Liberty]]'' in Italy, is recognisable in [[Palazzo Castiglioni (Milan)|Palazzo Castiglioni]], built by architect [[Giuseppe Sommaruga]] between 1901 and 1903.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Other examples include Hotel Corso,<ref name="ReferenceC"/> [[Casa Guazzoni]] with its wrought iron and staircase, and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional Milanese Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revival architecture, regarded as one of the last such types of architecture in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.100milano.com/liberty/191.html |title=Verso Una Conclusione: Casa Berri Meregalli |publisher=100milano.com |access-date=10 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424052448/http://www.100milano.com/liberty/191.html |archive-date=24 April 2012}}</ref> A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medieval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info2015expo.it/index.php?/archives/826-Castello-Cova.html |title=Castello Cova – info2015expo |publisher=Info2015expo.it |access-date=10 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424225206/http://www.info2015expo.it/index.php?%2Farchives%2F826-Castello-Cova.html |archive-date=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> An important example of [[Art Deco]], which blended such styles with [[Fascist architecture]], is the huge [[Milano Centrale|Central railway station]] inaugurated in 1931.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ICYUKYHQ_cC&q=milan+railway+station+1931&pg=PA119|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Milan & the Lakes|last=Birmingham|first=Brenda|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4053-6747-9|location=London|language=en|oclc=828734755|access-date=17 November 2020|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529132107/https://books.google.com/books?id=-ICYUKYHQ_cC&q=milan+railway+station+1931&pg=PA119|url-status=live}}</ref>

The post-World War II period saw rapid reconstruction and fast economic growth, accompanied by a nearly two-fold increase in population. In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including [[Giò Ponti|Gio Ponti]]'s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1956–60), [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1956–58), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low-quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, [[urban decay]] and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably [[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]] in downtown Milan and [[FieraMilano]] in the suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]]. In addition, the old exhibition area is being completely reshaped according to the [[CityLife (Milan)|Citylife]] regeneration project, featuring residencial areas, museums, an urban park and three skyscrapers designed by international architects, and after whom they are named: the {{convert|202|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Isozaki Arata]]—when completed, the tallest building in Italy,<ref name="Isozaki Tower Citylife"/> the twisted [[Zaha Hadid|Hadid Tower]],<ref name="Hadid Tower Citylife"/> and the curved [[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind Tower]].<ref name="Liebskind Tower Citylife"/>

Two business districts dominate Milan's skyline: ''Porta Nuova'' in the north-east (boroughs No. 9 and 2) and ''CityLife'' (borough No. 8) in the north-west part of the commune. The [[List of tallest buildings in Milan|tallest buildings]] include the [[Unicredit Tower]] at 231 m (though only 162 m without the spire), and the 209 m [[Allianz Tower]], a 50-story tower.

Also notable is [[Monte Stella (Milan)|Monte Stella]] ("Starmount"), also informally called Montagnetta di San Siro ("Little mountain of San Siro"), an artificial hill and surrounding city park in Milan. The hill was created using the debris from the buildings that were bombed during [[World War II]], as well as from the last remnants of the [[Walls of Milan|Spanish walls]] of the city, demolished in the mid 20th century. Even at only {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} height, the hill provides a panoramic view of the city and hinterland, and in a clear day, the [[Alps]] and [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] can be distinguished from atop. A notable area of the park is called "Giardino dei Giusti" (Garden of the Just), which is a memorial to distinguished opponents of genocide and crimes against humanity; each tree in the garden is dedicated to one such person. Notable people who have been dedicated a tree in the Giardino dei Giusti include [[Moshe Bejski]], [[Andrej Sakharov]], [[Svetlana Broz]], and [[Pietro Kuciukian]].

The [[Orto Botanico di Brera]] a [[botanical garden]] located behind [[Palazzo Brera]] at Via Brera 28 in the center of Milan, is another major park in the city. The garden consists primarily of rectangular flower-beds, trimmed in brick, with elliptical ponds from the 18th century, and specula and [[greenhouse]] from the 19th century (now used by the Academy of Fine Arts). It contains one of the oldest ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' trees in Europe, as well as mature specimens of ''[[Firmiana platanifolia]]'', ''[[Juglans nigra]]'', ''[[Pterocarya fraxinifolia]]'', and ''[[Tilia]]''. 

In addition, even though Milan is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Italy, it is surrounded by a belt of green areas and features numerous gardens even in its very centre. The farmlands and woodlands north (Parco Nord Milano since 1975) and south ([[Parco Agricolo Sud Milano]] since 1990) of the urban area have been protected as regional parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parconord.milano.it/scopri-il-parco/la-storia-del-parco/|title=La storia del Parco|date=18 October 2019 |access-date=29 October 2023|language=it}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cittametropolitana.mi.it/parco_agricolo_sud_milano/#:~:text=Il%20Parco%20Agricolo%20Sud%20Milano,un%20totale%20di%2047.000%20ettari.|title=Parco Agricolo Sud Milano|access-date=29 October 2023|language=it}}</ref> West of the city, the Parco delle Cave (Sand pit park) has been established on a neglected site where gravel and sand used to be extracted, featuring artificial lakes and woods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parcodellecave.it/index.php/informazioni-mainmenu/informazioni-parco/storia-del-parco|title=Parco delle Cave|access-date=29 October 2023|language=it}}</ref>

After [[World War II]], Milan experienced two main waves of immigration: the first, dating from the 1950s to the early 1970s, saw a large influx of migrants from poorer and rural areas within Italy; the second, starting from the late 1980s, has been characterized by the preponderance of foreign-born immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Foot|first=John|title=Mapping Diversity in Milan. Using the administrative division of the Milanese territory in the functional areas some important aspects of the spatial distribution of demographic phenomena can be captured. As well as the aggregated data on the stocks, the individual information (also geographically referenced) by the population register are considered for this purpose. The stocks at the 1st on January of the years from 2005 to 2009 are available. The totals for individuals and family are consistent with the totals published by ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics) by means of appropriate scaling coefficients, since some differences can occur between the two sources.

The early period coincided with the so-called Italian economic miracle of postwar years, an era of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and great public works, that brought to the city a large influx of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and underdeveloped [[Southern Italy]].<ref name="Foot" />

Decades of continuing high immigration have made the city one of the most cosmopolitan and multicultural in Italy. Immigrants came mainly from Africa (in particular [[Eritreans in Italy|Eritreans]], [[Egyptians in Italy|Egyptians]], [[Moroccans in Italy|Moroccans]], [[Senegalese people in Italy|Senegalese]] and [[Nigerian people in Italy|Nigerian]]), and the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (notably [[Albanians in Italy|Albanians]], [[Romanians in Italy|Romanians]], [[Ukrainians in Italy|Ukrainians]], [[Macedonian diaspora|Macedonians]], [[Moldovans]], and [[Russians in italy|Russians]]), in addition to a growing number of Asians (in particular [[Chinese people in Italy|Chinese]], [[Sri Lankans in Italy|Sri Lankans]] and [[Filipino Italians|Filipinos]]) and Latin Americans (Mainly South Americans). At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already had a population of foreign-born residents of approximately 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that rose rapidly to over 117,000 by the end of the decade (about 9% of the total).<ref>{{Cite book |author=Istituto Nazionale di Urbanistica della Lombardia |title=Lombardia, politiche e regole per il territorio |publisher=Alinea Editrice |year=1999 |isbn=88-8125-332-1 |location=Florence |page=139}}</ref>

Milan is home to the second-largest [[East Asia|Far East Asian]] community in Europe after [[Vietnamese community in Paris|Paris]], with the Philippines and China, making up about a quarter of its foreign population (around 76,000 out of 301,000 in 2023). Another 4,000 foreigners come from other East Asian countries; notably, Milan hosts more than 2,000 Japanese nationals and 1,000 Koreans, excluding those who also hold Italian citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statistiche Demografiche Cittadini stranieri Milano 2021 |url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/lombardia/18-milano/statistiche/cittadini-stranieri-2021/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210728131010/https://www.tuttitalia.it/lombardia/18-milano/statistiche/cittadini-stranieri-2021/ |archive-date=28 July 2021 |access-date=5 November 2021 |publisher=tuttitalia.it |language=it}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Foreigners holding East-Asian citizenship thus make up around 5.36% of the city's population. Milan notably hosts the oldest and largest (along with [[Prato]]) [[Chinatown, Milan|Chinese community]] in Italy, with around 37,000 people in 2023, excluding Italians of Chinese descent such as immigrants who have acquired Italian citizenship or their descendants. Situated in the [[Administrative divisions of Milan|8th district]], and centered on [[Via Paolo Sarpi]], an important commercial avenue, the Milanese Chinatown was originally established in the 1920s by immigrants from [[Wencheng County]], in the [[Zhejiang]], and used to operate small textile and leather workshops.<ref>{{Cite book

Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' for the monastery of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]].<ref name=Kemp>{{Cite book|first=Martin|last=Kemp|title=Leonardo|year=2004}}</ref>

In the late 18th century and throughout the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caffè'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture.

In the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Additionally, [[Giuseppe Parini]] and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship.

In the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.

After the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to prewar Italian movement of ''[[Verismo]]'' in Southern Italy, its greatest ''Verista'' novelist [[Giovanni Verga]] formed in Sicily who wrote his most important books in Milan.

In addition to Italian, approximately 2&nbsp;million people in Northern Italy can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or other [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coluzzi|first=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy: an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3-03911-041-4|page=260}}</ref>

Like most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, butter than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no tomato or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]]'', a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]). Other typical dishes are ''[[cassoeula]]'' (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with [[Cabbage|Savoy cabbage]]), ''[[ossobuco]]'' (braised [[veal]] shank served with a condiment called ''[[gremolata]]''), ''[[risotto|risotto alla milanese]]'' (with [[saffron]] and beef marrow), ''busecca'' (stewed [[tripe]] with beans), ''[[mondeghili]]'' ([[meatballs]] made with leftover meat fried in butter) and ''brasato'' (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).

Season-related pastries include ''chiacchiere'' (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and ''tortelli'' (fried spherical cookies) for [[Carnival]], ''colomba'' (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for Easter, ''pane dei morti'' ("bread of the (Day of the) Dead", cookies flavoured with [[cinnamon]]) for [[All Souls' Day]] and [[panettone]] for Christmas. The ''salame Milano'', a [[salami]] with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy. Renowned Milanese cheeses are [[gorgonzola]] (from the [[Gorgonzola, Milan|namesake]] village nearby), [[mascarpone]], used in pastry-making, [[taleggio cheese|taleggio]] and quartirolo.

The ''[[comune]]'' of [[San Colombano al Lambro]], located about {{convert|40|km}} south-east of Milan, is home to the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) wine which includes 100 hectares (250 acres) producing a single red wine.
