'''Sétif''' ({{langx|ar|سطيف}}) is the capital city of the [[Sétif Province]] and the 5th most populous city of [[Algeria]], with an estimated population of 410,000  residents in 2015 in an area of more than 127&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (49 sq mi). It is one of the most important cities of eastern Algeria and the country as a whole, since it is considered the [[trade]] capital of the country and an industrial pole with 3 industrial zones within the borders of the city.

It is an inner city, situated in the eastern side of Algeria, 270 kilometers east of [[Algiers]], 131&nbsp;km west of [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]], in the [[Hautes Plaines]] region south of [[Béjaia]] and [[Jijel]]. The city is at 1,100 meters of altitude.

The city was part of the Phoenician Empire then it became part of the ancient [[Berbers|Berber]] kingdom of [[Numidia]], the capital of [[Mauretania Sitifensis]] under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]]. It was destroyed during the Arab invasion of North Africa. In 1839 when France occupied the site, they found it in ruins apart from Roman ruins of the Byzantine fortress of Setif,<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Beautiful Cities of Algeria - Setif (3) |lang=fr |website=algeroisementvotre.free.fr |url=http://algeroisementvotre.free.fr/site2000/setif001/villes03c.html |access-date=2024-07-24 }}</ref> and the ruined civilian housing from roman and byzantine periods. Reconstruction of a civilian part of the city began with the construction of a Catholic Church of Setif which is the first building established by the colonial French.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Compagnie genevoise des colonies suisses de Sétif |url=https://setif.com/Compagnie_genevoise.html |access-date=2024-07-24 |website=setif.com |quote="Lorsque les Français s'installèrent sur le site de l'ancienne Sétifis, l'antique cité avait disparu, il n'en subsistait que des ruines, comme en témoigne cette gravure, datant de 1839"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boudjenouia |first=Abdelmalek |last2=Fleury |first2=André |last3=Tacherift |first3=Abdelmalek |date=2006-03-01 |title=Le statut de l'espace agricole périurbain à Sétif (Algérie) : réserve foncière ou projet urbain ? |url=https://revues.cirad.fr/index.php/cahiers-agricultures/article/view/30581 |journal=Cahiers Agricultures |language=fr |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=221–226 (1) |issn=1777-5949 |quote=Setif, a mid-sized city located on the Algerian highlands, was founded in 1847}}</ref>

The city was the starting point of the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre|8 May 1945 protests and massacre]], which was a crucial factor to the start of the [[Algerian War]].

== Etymology ==
Sétif was [[Numidia|numidan]] before undergoing [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule. The name of Sétif comes from Latin "Sitifis", that is drawn from a [[Berber languages|Berber]] word "Zdif" which means "black lands" referring to the fertility of its lands.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The prehistory of Setif begins with the first traces of human occupation, about 2.4 million years ago, and ends with the first [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] texts, in the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BC]].

The site of [[Aïn El Ahnech]], in [[Guelta Zerka]], includes several sites that have yielded very ancient [[Lithic technology|lithic]] remains of the Oldoway type, but without associated human fossils. The [[Aïn Boucherit]] site delivered in 2018 [[Lithic technology|lithic industry]] remains (carved stone tools), dated between 1.9 and 2.4 million years ago. On November 29, 2018, [[Science (journal)|the journal Science]] announced the dating of the site by four corroborating methods:<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sahnouni |first=Mohamed |date=2018 |title=1.9-million- and 2.4-million-year-old artifacts and stone tool–cutmarked bones from Ain Boucherit, Algeria |url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau0008 |journal=Science |volume=362 |issue=6420 |pages=1297–1301 |doi=10.1126/science.aau0008 |pmid=30498166 |bibcode=2018Sci...362.1297S |hdl=10072/383164 |s2cid=54166305 |hdl-access=free |access-date=9 February 2023 |archive-date=22 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122211753/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau0008 |url-status=live }}</ref> negative geomagnetic polarity reported to the Matuyama chron, ESR dating, biochronology (fossil species assemblages) and sedimentation rate. Aïn Boucherit could be the third oldest African site after [[Lomekwi|Lomekwi 3]] in [[Kenya]] (3.3 Ma), and [[Gona, Ethiopia|Kada Gona]] in [[Ethiopia]] (2.55 Ma). The prehistoric site of Ain El Ahnech is located a few kilometers east of the city, and the age of the lithic remains is estimated by archaeomagnetism to be about 2.4 million years old. It is an ancient lake, located in the commune of [[Guelta Zerka]]. The site was discovered in [[1947]] by the French [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Camille Arambourg]] (1885-1969), during his paleontological research of continental deposits in the Setif region. On November 29, 2018, a discovery of tools dating back 2.4 million years was published, making this site, at the time of its discovery, the cradle of Humanity before that of Tanzania. Professor [[Mohamed Sahnouni]] confirms this discovery.

=== Ancient history ===

==== Numidia ====
[[File:Kingdom of Numidia-02.png|thumb|300x300px|Map of the Kingdom of Numidia]]
The city, of [[Numidia]]n origin, was part of the kingdom of [[Masaesyli|Massaesyli]] in the year [[225 BC]]. It was also considered as a capital before [[Juba II]] preferred [[Cherchell]].

It was near Sétif that [[Jugurtha]] campaigned and lost against [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] in [[105 BC]]. Overcome by Marius, he was taken to [[Rome]] where was executed in the prison of [[Mamertine Prison|Tullianum]]. No remains of this period have been found. The city was small under the Numidian kings.

==== Roman Era ====
[[File:Jardin à setif 8.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Roman ruins in El Amir garden, the city center]]

It was an integral part of the Roman province of Caesarian Mauritania which became Setifian Mauritania. When Jugurtha was delivered, Sitifis became part of the kingdom of Mauretania, successively attributed to Bocchus then Boccuris, Juba II and finally to Ptolemy of Mauretania, assassinated at Lugdunum at the instigation of Caligula.

For its strategic situation, Sitifis interested Nerva who installed there from 96 AD a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony for veteran]]s the Colonia Nerviana Augusta Martialis Veteranorum Sitifensium. Although no buildings of this period are known, a cemetery excavated in the 1960s seems to have contained tombs from the early colony.<ref>R. Guéry, 1985, ''La Necropole orientale de Sitifis: fouilles de 1966–1967''. Paris.</ref> Claudius reduced Mauritania into a Roman province, divided it in two, and attached Setif to the new Caesarian Mauritania, capital Caesarea (Cherchell). In 290, Setif became the capital of [[Mauretania Sitifensis]] (present-day eastern Algeria), detached from [[Mauretania Caesariensis]]. The new province was then under the diocese of Africa, itself under the prefecture of Italy.<ref>Francois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa (James Clarke & Co, 2011) p.&nbsp;2.</ref>

===== Mauretania Sitifensis =====
{{main|Mauretania Sitifensis}}
[[File:Diocese of Africa - AD 400.png|thumb|200x200px|Map of the Roman Empire ca. 400 AD, showing Mauretania Sitifensis]]
In the later division of the [[Roman Empire]] under the Emperor [[Diocletian]], the eastern part of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], from [[Saldae]] to the river Ampsaga, was split into a new province, and called Mauretania Sitifensis named after the inland town of [[Setifis]] ([[Setif]] in modern [[Algeria]]).

At the time of [[Constantine the Great]], Mauretania Sitifensis was assigned to the administrative [[Diocese of Africa]], under the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]]. The new province had a huge economic development in the 4th century, until the conquest by the [[Vandals]]. In this province, the Christian denomination known as [[Donatism]] challenged the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]] (which was the main local religion after Constantine), while Setifis was a center of [[Mithraism]].

After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], certain areas of Mauretania Sitifensis were under Vandal and later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] control, but most of the province (until 578 AD) was ruled by [[Berbers|Berber]] kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Altava]]. Only the coastal area around Saldae and Setifis remained fully [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]].

Byzantine emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] in 585 AD created the province of Mauretania Prima and erased the old Mauretania Sitifensis. Indeed, the emperor Maurice in that year created the office of "Exarch", which combined the supreme civil authority of a [[praetorian prefect]] and the military authority of a ''[[magister militum]]'', and enjoyed considerable autonomy from [[Constantinople]]. Two exarchates were established, one in [taly, with seat at [[Ravenna]] (hence known as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), and one in Africa, based at Carthage and including all imperial possessions in the Western Mediterranean. The first African exarch was the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine period|''Patricius'']] [[Gennadius (magister militum Africae)|Gennadius]]: he was appointed as ''magister militum'' [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|''Africae'']] in 578 AD, and quickly defeated the Romano-Moorish kingdom of [[Garmul]] in [[Mauretania]] extending the territory of the Mauretania Sitifensis. Among the provincial changes done by emperor Maurice, Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Sitifensis were re-merged as a province of Mauretania Prima.

Mauretania Sitifensis initially had an area of 17800 square miles and had a good agriculture (cereals, etc..), that was exported through the port of [[Saldae]]. But under Byzantine control the province was reduced to only the coastal section, with one third of the original area.

In the newly prosperous town a [[Thermae|bath building]] was built, decorated with fine mosaics: its restoration in the fifth century had a cold room (''frigidarium'') paved with a large mosaic showing the birth of Venus.<ref>E. Fentress, ed., ''Fouilles de Sétif 1977–1984'' BAA supp. 5, Algiers, 29–92</ref> On the northwest edge of the town two great Christian [[basilica]]s were built at the end of the fourth century, decorated, again, with splendid [[mosaic]]s,<ref>P.-A. Fevrier, ''Fouilles de Sétif: les basiliques chrétiennes du quartier nord-ouest'' Paris, 1965.</ref> and a [[Bishopric]] was founded at this time.
There was a Jewish community in the area.<ref>Francois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa (James Clarke & Co, 2011) p13</ref> The [[Romans-sur-Isère|Romans]] built a [[Circus (building)#row-Sitifis|circus at Sitifis]], which aerial photographs show survived substantially intact until the 20th century; today only a small part of the curved end continues visible; the remainder has been destroyed or built over. In the 5th century it suffered from a violent earthquake.<ref>Augustine, Ep., lxxxiv; Serm., xix.</ref>

The region of Sétif was one of the granaries of ancient Rome: Caput Saltus Horreorum (today Aïn-Zada) was its seat.

The city has preserved vestiges from the 2nd and 4th centuries: ramparts, a temple, a circus, a mausoleum known as "Scipio's", etc. The product of the archaeological excavations is preserved and exhibited in the city's Archaeological Museum, and various steles in the Abd el-Kader garden. It is to put in relation with the site of [[Cuicul]] (Djemila).

===== Bishopric =====
The city was the base of a [[Bishopric]].<ref>Francois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa (James Clarke & Co, 2011) p.&nbsp;84.</ref> [[Augustine]], who had frequent relations with Sitifis, tells us that in his day the Bishopric had a [[monastery]] and an episcopal school. Several Christian inscriptions have been found there, one of 452 mentioning the relics of [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]], another naming two [[martyr]]s of Sitifis, Justus and Decurius.

==== Vandal Era ====
[[File:Peutinger-Bida.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] map (4th century) showing Sitifi Colonia (Sétif)]]Preluding the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476, the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]] of the [[Vandals]], led by their king [[Gaiseric|Genseric]] (427- 477), crossed from [[Spain]] to Africa in 429 at the request of the Roman governor [[Bonifatius]], who was in revolt against the Emperor [[Valentinian III]]. The route of the Vandals in Africa, from [[Tingi]] (Tangier) to [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], passed through [[Setifis]], which was probably reached in 430. Bonifatius defeated, Genseric established the seat of his kingdom in Carthage in 439, forcing the emperor to recognize him as master of Roman Africa.

Under the Vandals it was the chief town of a district called Zaba.

==== Byzantine Era ====
[[File:Romain ruins Sétif.jpg|thumb|Byzantine fortress west wall.]]In 531, the king of the [[Vandals]], [[Hilderic]], was overthrown by the usurper [[Gelimer]], giving the Roman emperor of the East [[Justinian I|Justinian]], anxious to restore the [[Roman Empire]], a pretext for intervention. After his departure from [[Byzantium]] ([[Constantinople]] / [[Istanbul]]), General [[Belisarius]] took advantage of uprisings in [[Tripolitania]] and the [[Moors]], which enabled him to take [[Carthage]] (533) and then Gelimer himself (534).

The Byzantines found in [[Setifis|Sitifis]], a small population, because of the vandal predations. In 539, Sitifis again became the capital of a Byzantine "Roman" province: [[Mauretania Sitifensis|Mauritania Sitifensis]]. At that time, [[Solomon (magister militum)|Solomon]] built the Byzantine fortress walls, whose west and south walls are still visible.

=== Islamic Era ===
In 647 AD (the year 27 of the Hijrah), the first [[Muslim]] expedition to Africa took place. By 700&nbsp;AD, the area had been conquered and converted to the [[Islamic faith]]. We know little of the early Islamic town, but by the tenth century the area outside of the fortress was once more filled with houses: on the site of the Roman baths over twelve of these were excavated, with large courtyards surrounded by long, thin, rooms.<ref>E. Fentress, ed., ''Fouilles de Sétif 1977–1984'' BAA supp. 5, Algiers, 114–151</ref>

Setif according to the geographer and historian [[Al-Bakri]]:

"The city of Sétif is two days from El-Mecila (...) one arrives at Sétif, a large and important city, whose origin dates back to ancient times.' The wall that surrounded it was destroyed by the Ketama, followers of Abu Abd'Allah ash-Shi'i, because the Arabs had taken it away from them and had forced them to pay a tithe every time they wanted to enter it. It is now without walls, but it is nevertheless well populated and very flourishing. The bazaars are in great number, and all the commodities are in great number, Sétif is ten days from Kairouan, ten days from Gazrouna and one day from Tanaguelalt located in the neighborhood of Mila. ".

The city was successively administered by the Muslim dynasties that ruled North Africa: Umayyads, Abbasids, Aghlabids, Fatimids, Zirids, Almohads, Hafsids, Ottomans. According to the historian Al-Yaqubi in the Kitab al-Buldan, taken up by A.Duri, a fraction of the Arabs Banu Assad ibn Khuzaima called Banu Usluja originating from Iraq settled in Setif at the time of the [[Aghlabids]] with non-Arabs (Persian abna) from Khorasan.

In 903, following the death of the [[Aghlabid]] emir [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya]], Sétif briefly served as the headquarters of his son [[Muhammad (Aghlabid prince)|Muhammad]]. Muhammad intended to lead a military campaign against the [[Isma'ili]] leader [[Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i]], who had gained a following among the [[Kutama]] Berbers, but he aborted it before any battles were fought because his brother [[Abdallah II of Ifriqiya|Abdallah]] had been murdered. Intending to seize the throne, Muhammad left Sétif for the capital of [[Tunis]], but he was arrested in [[Baghaya]] and then executed by the new emir, [[Ziyadat Allah III of Ifriqiya|Ziyadat Allah III]], alongside all of Ziyadat Allah's brothers and uncles, in August 903.<ref name="Halm">{{cite book |last1=Halm |first1=Heinz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usUjj9OV9l0C |title=The Empire of the Mahdi: The Rise of the Fatimids (Translated from the German by Michael Bonner) |date=1996 |publisher=E.J. Brill |isbn=90-04-10056-3 |location=Leiden |pages=107–108 |access-date=3 September 2020}}</ref>

This internal power struggle enabled Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i to go on the offensive and capture Sétif from the Aghlabids. He had already tried to besiege the strongly fortified city twice, but to no avail. However, in probably October or November of 904, after the city's Arab ruler died, a Berber from the [[Lahisa]] tribe surrendered the city to Abu Abdallah, who then demolished part of the fortifications to prevent them from being used against him and his Kutama allies. Then, possibly encouraged by Abu Abdallah's military success, the Isma'ili imam [[Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah]] (who would later found the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]) left Egypt to go to the Maghreb.<ref name="Halm" />

After conquering [[Cairo]], the [[Fatimids]] abandoned [[Tunisia]] and parts of eastern [[Algeria]] to the local [[Zirids]] (972–1148).<ref name="stearns2">{{cite book |last1=Stearns |first1=Peter N. |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged |last2=Leonard Langer |first2=William |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-395-65237-5 |edition=6 |pages=129–131}}</ref> The invasion of [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Banu Hilal]], a warlike [[Arabs|Arab]] tribes encouraged by the Fatimids of [[Egypt]] to seize North Africa.

It was in Sétif that the [[battle of Sétif]] took place between the Hilalian Arabs and the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] [[Berbers]], which resulted in the victory of the Almohads.<ref>{{Cite web |title=IBN-ALATHYR : EXTRAITS DE L'Histoire des croisades |url=http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/arabe/alathyr/croisades6.htm |access-date=2023-02-09 |website=remacle.org |archive-date=14 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414055541/http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/arabe/alathyr/croisades6.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Remains of this Arab-Muslim period were unearthed in the early 1980s. According to Khelifa Abderrahmane, the results of these excavations are very interesting: "The city was not totally abandoned and the remains of the baths served as occasional shelter for men and livestock. The development of the Muslim city would have taken place first to the north of the Byzantine fortress."

This excavation demonstrated that the first Islamic houses were built with reused ashlars reinforced on their inner side with pebbles bound with adobe. Carbon 14 dating refers to a period between 655 and 970. The excavation brought to light nine buildings that were dated between the year 810 (during the Aghlabid period) and 974 (during the Fatimid caliphate). A coin of the Fatimid caliph [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|Al Mu'izz]] with a figurative ceramic shard was found in the third floor. According to Khelifa Abderahmane, the important thing is that the excavation was able to identify a typology of the tenth and eleventh century habitat for this region, with pieces that are longer than they are wide.19 The Arab tribe of Bani Hil'izz was the first to be found in the area.

==== Ottoman Empire ====
During the [[Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman era]], the city of Sétif saw great interest from the Ottomans and experienced noticeable development. An Islamic neighborhood was found in the Sétif recreation park. The city also witnessed several major battles between the Beys of Tunis and Constantine during the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

We find that there are several Ottoman monuments in the city of Sétif, including some landmarks in the region and the Al-Atiq mosque located in the heart of the city and the Abu Zer Al-Ghafari mosque located in the city. Both of these mosques date back to the Ottoman era and, especially their minarets, still testify to the brilliance of Islamic art to this day.

In the mid-eleventh century this development stopped abruptly, and a defensive wall was built around the city. Nothing more is known of Sétif until the ruins of the town were used by the French army, who built their own fortress on the site in 1848, using the line of the medieval city wall and the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]] fortress.

=== French era ===
[[File:Sétif CoA (French Algeria).svg|thumb|110x110px|Coat of arms of Sétif during French colonization]]
In 1838, the city was taken by a column of the French colonial army as part of the operations to take Constantine. The occupation was initially military, but civilians (workers) soon flocked to the city. A first urban plan of the city was set up by decree in 1843 and saw the formation of a European city in 1846. The following year, on February 11, 1847, a European city was created by royal decree with an endowment of 2,509 hectares of land. From 1850, the city became a center of colonial settlement attracted by the agricultural potential of the region.

The colonization developed notably under the Second Empire, and accentuated the urban structuring of the current city center. The construction of the station of Sétif, on the Algiers-Constantine line, would have been decided by the town council in 1877.

In 1926, the city saw the launch of a social housing program for the Algerians of Sétif.

==== Massacre in Sétif (1945) ====
{{main|Sétif and Guelma massacre}}
[[File:Carte Massacre Sétif, Guelma, Kherrata, 1945.svg|thumb|200x200px|Map of the Setif, Guelma and Kherrata massacres in 1945]]
On 8 May [[1945]], the day of the formal end of [[World War II]] in Europe, Sétif was the starting point for a series of nationalist riots that were bloodily suppressed by the French colonial authorities. The demonstrations and the explosion of violence that accompanied them originated in a nationalist insurrection project whose aim was to create a "liberated zone" with a provisional government led by [[Messali Hadj]]. But these plans had to be abandoned after Messali's failed escape attempt from his house arrest and his transfer to [[Brazzaville]]. The Sétif riot, often presented as the consequence of popular anger caused by the death of the flag-bearer {{Ill|Bouzid Saâl|fr|Bouzid Saâl}}, was in fact "a real armed insurrection that left 23 dead and 80 wounded Europeans and estimates of Algerian casualties vary widely from 2,000 to 40,000.
[[File:Manifestation du 8 mai 1945 à Setif.svg|thumb|300x300px|Map of the course of the protests of May the 9th, 1945 in Setif]]
The news of the riot quickly spread throughout the region. The demonstration of independence fighters in Sétif turns into a violent insurrection. The revolt spread to neighboring towns. The repression that followed was disproportionate and extremely brutal, killing thousands of demonstrators. This repression was carried out by the army and civilian militias. 3,700 men were deployed in the subdivision of Sétif (equivalent to two French departments). It was Governor Chataigneau who declared a state of siege. He gave full powers to General Henri Martin, head of the army in North Africa, to "restore emergency order.

France announced 103 dead Europeans and 110 wounded (84 killed, including 13 women on the first day of the riot in Setif and its surroundings); between 600 and 1,500 Algerians were killed or wounded. 400 killed and 250 wounded by the army, 200 killed by the air force, and about ten killed by the navy, but there were also 2,000 to 3,000 Muslim deaths as a result of the reaction of civilians who, from the start of the riots, organized themselves into self-defense militias. Officially, the Algerian government counted 45,000 victims, a figure put forward in the summer of 1945 by the [[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA). In 2015, French historians François Cochet, [[Maurice Faivre]], Guy Pervillé and Roger Vétillard, reviewing recent research by a dozen French historians, estimated the number of Algerian victims at between 3,000 and 8,000 dead.

==== The Algerian War (1954–1962) ====
{{main|Algerian War}}

The events in Sétif during the Algerian War were marked by political and social unrest, as well as acts of violence and resistance against the French colonial government. The conflict that started in 1945 continued for several years, with acts of sabotage, guerrilla warfare and armed attacks being carried out by both sides. During the outbreak of the revolution, the city was marked by the following events:

* Commando operation against policeman Benton in 1956,
* Elimination of Brigadier Ferrand in 1957,
* Elimination of Dr. Kanaba, a member of the organization "the hand," in 1958,
* Clash at the train station in the Tlidjan district in 1960,
* Release of death row prisoners in 1961,
* Battle of the city market in 1962. The city of Sétif offered many martyrs including: Bouchareb Roumila / Harchi Masaouda / Zarrougui Kheira / Sebti Naima / Narwal Zouina / ... / Mohammed Kerouani / Sheikh El Aifa ...

The events in Sétif during the war reflect the broader struggle for independence and self-determination that was taking place in Setif as well as across the country.

Eventually, the war ended with Algeria gaining independence from France in 1962. The events in Sétif during the Algerian War remain a sensitive and controversial issue in the country's modern history.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
The natural structure of Sétif is characterized by its non-homogeneity due to its location between two distinct regions; the Tellian Atlas in the north and the Aures mountains in the south, with the plain region in the middle. This diversity results in a city with both a wide and elevated terrain, reaching an altitude of 1,100 meters. The city also has a unique geographical position that separates the Tellian Atlas in the north and the desert chain in the south. This combination of diverse landscapes and geographical features makes the city of Sétif a unique and attractive place to live and visit.

=== Hydrography ===
The hydrography of Sétif is characterized by its wadis, or dry riverbeds, which have an irregular flow due to climatic data and precipitation patterns. The main waterways are the Boussalem and El Kébir wadis.

The hydrography of Sétif plays a crucial role in the city's water management and availability. The unpredictable flow of the wadis can make access to water resources challenging, but they also provide a source of water for both the city and surrounding agricultural lands. Effective management and conservation of these resources is necessary for sustainable development in the region.

=== Geology and relief ===
The geology of Sétif is defined by its location on the high plateaus of the Little Kabylie region in northeastern Algeria. The city is situated on sedimentary rock formations composed mainly of sandstones, marls, and limestones. These rock formations are rich in mineral resources, including iron, lead, and zinc, which have played a significant role in the economic development of the region. The geology of the area is also characterized by its high altitude, which provides a cooler climate and stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The geology and relief of Sétif work together to create a unique environment that sets it apart from other cities in the region. The diverse and varied landscape provides a rich and interesting environment, with features such as towering cliffs, rolling hills, and fertile valleys all contributing to the character of the region.

The city of is located in a region that is characterized by a great diversity in its geological formations, whether in terms of age, nature, or affiliation to the geological units. This is what the geological map of the city shows, where there are three main groups:

Formations of the Rbai Era, which are divided into three types: Modern formations: Representing Tmai, granite, and limestone, which are located near the main wadies, where erosion is still active, and these deposits form a group of areas near these wadies, especially along the Boslam valley. Undefined formations: Formed from the slopes deposits of Tmai and granite and form arable land for agriculture, which spreads along the main wadies in a circular shape. Sometimes they form a group of small plateaus, the most important of which is the Fermatou plateau. Ancient formations: Representing clays from the Bechar sea and flanks of the Philakron formation, with a feature that distinguishes it by the uplift of the Setifian high plateau.

Formations of the Tertiary Era: Paleocene Formations: Representing sand, Tmai limestone and clay. It is located in the form of a wide strip in the eastern side, narrowing to the west with some northern and southern branches. These formations form the foundation on which the city of Setif is located.

Formations of the Paleozoic Era: Formations of the Permian and Lothian: Representing white clay with cracks of black silica. They are located in narrow areas to the north of the city Cambrian and Mastricht formations: Represents white clay with fragments of sandstone and black shale. They are located in limited areas in the eastern part of the city.

This geographical diversity reflects the historical, cultural and economic richness of the city of Setif and its surrounding areas, making it a unique destination for geological tourism.

=== Climate ===
Many factors are involved in determining the climate of Sétif, which are: the estimated altitude of 1,100 m, the distance of 50&nbsp;km from the Mediterranean Sea, its location on the eastern [[Hautes Plaines]] and the fact that it is, of course, surrounded by mountains, the combination of these factors means that Sétif enjoys a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger climate classification]] BSk), its summers are hot and dry, while its winters are cold and rainy.

Due to Setif's location in the highlands, it has one of the coldest winters in Algeria, it frequently sees annual snowfalls of up to 40&nbsp;cm. The region records significant rainfall in winter. Flash floods are rare, but have recently occurred around spring and fall. The summer is relatively hot, where extreme heat waves are frequent around July and August, when temperatures can sometimes exceed 40&nbsp;°C.

=== Vegetation ===
The vegetation coverage of Sétif is characterized by a low percentage of the minimum ecological balance, estimated at 25% of the total area of the wilaya. Forests make up a significant portion of the vegetation, representing 66.15% of the total area of the wilaya, including 62,750 hectares of natural forests and 39,144 hectares of planted forests, which make up 41.38% of the total tree coverage. The low vegetation coverage in the city of Sétif is a concern as it can lead to soil erosion, reduced air quality, and decreased biodiversity. On the other hand, the high percentage of forested area within the wilaya provides important ecological benefits, including carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities. It is crucial for the city to address the low vegetation coverage and work towards improving the balance between urbanization and preservation of the natural environment.

== Administration ==
[[File:Sétif OSM 01.png|thumb|200x200px]]
The municipality of Sétif was created at the beginning of independence, on July the 5th, 1962.

The municipality of Setif includes 12 administrative annexes elaborating the activities that affect the civil status of citizens. These annexes are: Downtown, Cité El Moustakbel (Birguey), Cité Yahaoui (Tandja), Cité 1er Novembre (1014), Bouaroua, El Hidhab, El Hassi, Ain Trik, El Baz, Chouf Lekdad, Chikh El Aifa, Tlidjan (Beau marché).

=== Urbanism and architecture ===
[[File:Sitifiana actualidad.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The municipal theater]]
Setif saw a significant growth in [[modern architecture]] between 1930 and 1962, reflecting the urban dynamics of the city and being influenced by various factors such as financial measures, technological processes, and the work of architects and contractors. The introduction of reinforced concrete was a catalyst for the development of modern architecture in the city, with [[François Hennebique]] design agency being instrumental in enabling the use of the material in various architectural works such as grain silos, banks, and townhouses. The colonial state was involved in social housing programs starting from the early 20th century, creating suburban housing districts, garden cities, and workers' housing schemes. The city center of Setif was reinvested twice, with modern architecture being promoted in the 1930s with public operations, and after World War 2 by the holders of agricultural capital, who consolidated the best locations to form tall buildings made with reinforced concrete structures. The new modern urban form neighborhood, The Pines, located at the southern boundary of the public hospital, which was highly regarded for its architecture and modern amenities. The architecture in The Pines was utilitarian, focusing on functionality and the absence of ornament, while the Bouaroua district located at the eastern end of the city saw a similar situation. Some buildings in Setif showed a return to the past with an Arabist style, drawing on Islamic architecture, and this return was seen as more of a [[Situationist approach]] than a doctrine. Setif was a testing ground for the Modern Movement, with the application and experimentation of modern architecture and building techniques, and a mix of traditional and modern elements being incorporated into the city's architectural language.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Setif |first1=Samaï Bouadjadja |last2=Mazouz |first2=Saïd |date=2015-03-01 |title=Modern Architecture in Setif (Algeria, 1930–1962).

Sheep breeding is very common in the Sétif region. The sheep population accounts for about 85% of the total livestock population with approximately 90,000 ewes.

Cattle breeding is highly developed in the most favorable suburban areas where irrigated forage crops or grasslands along the streams that run through the city from north to south are observed. They represent about 15% of the total large livestock population in the area.

Goat breeding alone is more common in the rural areas, in wooded and mountainous areas. In these peripheral farms, the goat is associated with sheep; however, the size of the populations is very small and does not exceed 10 heads per breeder.

Poultry breeding. Chicken egg farming accounts for nearly 62% of the structures of this activity, followed by chicken meat farming. e) Beekeeping is very rare in the agricultural landscape of Sétif.

==== Monuments and attractions ====
[[File:Ain El Fouara - Setif عين الفوارة - سطيف (48374418556).jpg|thumb|333x333px|Ain Fouara fountain]]
[[Ain El Fouara Fountain|Ain El Fouara fountain]] is one of the most important historical monuments in the city of Sétif. It was moved to the city of Sétif during the time of French colonialism in 1899 AD and was placed in the heart of the old city in the middle of three religious monuments, the old mosque, the Jewish temple and the church, in the middle of Independence Square. This fountain represents a huge sculpture created by the French sculptor [[Francis de Saint-Vidal]], the stories differed on the true history of the construction of this monument.

[[The Byzantine citadel of Sétif]] is a largely preserved carved stone wall that surrounded a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fortress built in the first half of the 6th century, around 540 AD. It was built by [[Solomon (magister militum)|General Solomon]] with the aim of securing the Byzantine camp from surprise attacks. After the Islamic conquest of the city of Setif, the citadel was used for various purposes, including grain storage and as stables for animals. During the French colonial period, the citadel regained its original function as a defensive structure, with a military barracks and hospital being built inside it. The citadel is built from massive blocks of cut stone, 2.5 meters thick, in a rectangular shape.[[File:Setif - parc d'attraction حديقة التسلية بسطيف - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Park Mall seen from the amusement park]]
