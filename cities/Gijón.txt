'''Gijón''' ({{IPA|es|xiˈxon|lang|Pronunciation of Gijón in Spanish.ogg}}) or '''{{lang|ast|Xixón|italics=no}}''' ({{IPA-ast|ʃiˈʃoŋ|lang}}) is a city and municipality in north-western Spain. It is the largest city and [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] by population in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Asturias]]. It is located on the coast of the [[Cantabrian Sea]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], in the central-northern part of Asturias; it is approximately {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Oviedo]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://esdistancia.com/route/oviedo/gijon|title=Distancia de Oviedo a Gijón en coche|website=esdistancia.com|language=es|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> the capital of Asturias, and {{convert|26|km|abbr=on}} from [[Avilés]].

Gijón forms part of a large metropolitan area that includes twenty councils in the center of the region, structured with a dense network of roads, highways and railways and with a population of 835,053 inhabitants in 2011, making it the seventh largest in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fomento.gob.es/MFOM.CP.Web/handlers/pdfhandler.ashx?idpub=BAW013|title=Información estadística de las grandes áreas urbanas españolas|date=2012|website=Ministerio de fomento, ed.}}</ref>

During the 20th century, Gijón developed as an industrial city in the steel and naval industries. However, due to the decline in manufacturing in these industries, in recent years Gijón is undergoing a transformation into an important tourist, university, commercial and R&D center. Gijón is the location of the [[Radiotelevisión del Principado de Asturias]], the neighbourhood of [[Cimavilla]], the [[Universidad Laboral de Gijón]], the Revillagigedo Palace, and the adjoining Collegiate Church of San Juan Bautista.

Gijón is part of the statistical (not yet developed from an administrative standpoint) [[Comarcas of Spain|''comarca'']] of [[Gijón (comarca)|Gijón]].

==Etymology==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
One theory based on some early medieval texts mention it as "Gigia", derived from the identical Greek and Latin term "gigias", meaning "giant", both of which refer to the Greek mythological giant [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigas]]. The medieval "Gigia" name, in turn, more specifically would refer to the ancient Roman wall built on the peninsula of the [[Cimavilla]] neighbourhood of Gijón. This wall was called the "Gegionem" by the Romans, and is itself a compound Latin term being either "geg-ionem", meaning "giant-ness/gigantic", "gegi-onem", meaning "concrete giant", or "gegio-nem" meaning "giant end". Presumably the use of the term meaning "giant" referred to either the pre-Germanic Astur peoples who inhabited the area being of large physical stature, or simply the largeness of the wall itself.

The name of the city might also come from the hypothetical Roman actual name of the place "Sessio" which may have turned into the word "Xixón" as the centuries went by. Then the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word "Gijón", which has been also written during the Middle age as "Jijón" or even "Jixón", would be a Castilianization of the [[Asturian language|Asturian]] name. This theory is nowadays known as the most acceptable.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Gijón}}

===Prehistory and Romanization===
[[File:Campa Torres, casa romana, 01.jpg|thumb|View of the archaeological site of {{ill|Campa Torres|es}}]]
The first evidence of human presence in what is known nowadays as the municipality of Gijón is located on Monte Deva, where there exists a series of [[tumuli]], and on Monte Areo, where there are some neolithic dolmens. These dolmens were discovered in 1990 and were supposedly built around 5000 BC.<ref>Ayuntamiento de Gijón (ed.). "[https://www.gijon.info/page/6443-dolmenes-del-monte-areo Dólmenes del Monte Areo]". Consultado el 28 de enero de 2016.</ref>

The first noticed settlement (Noega) is located in Campa Torres. It has its origin between the 6th and 5th centuries BC. It was populated by [[Astures]] (''Cilúrnigos'') and later Romanized. Noega was progressively abandoned when the Roman wall in the peninsula of [[Cimavilla]], called the ''Gegionem'', was built.

===Middle Ages and modern era===
[[File:GijonsigloXVII.jpg|thumb|View of Gijón {{circa|1630}}]]
[[File:Plano de Gijón, 1910.jpg|thumb|Map of Gijón in 1910]]
The invasions of barbarian tribes in the 5th and 6th centuries left no traces. The region submitted to the power of the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] king [[Sisebut]] in the 7th century. This period marks the beginnings of Christianization, one of the first Christian worshipping places being the Roman villa of Veranes.

Gijón was capital of the Muslim territories on the [[Cantabric Sea]], under the power of [[Munuza]], for a short period between 713 and 718 or 722. In 722 the Asturians won the [[Battle of Covadonga]] which is regarded as the beginning of the [[Reconquista]]. The Asturian forces were led by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], who would become the first king of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]].

Until 1270 there were no reliable references to Gijón as a settlement, with only short mentions in some documents. In this year, [[Alfonso X of Castile]] gave it the status of ''puebla''. This documentation appears in the [[Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo]].

In the 14th century, the war between [[Alfonso Enríquez, Count of Gijón and Noreña]] and [[Henry III of Castile]] ended when the village of Gijón was burned and totally destroyed, practically disappearing. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Gijón reemerged. A new dock was built in the port adding fishing and commerce to the area. In the 17th and 18th centuries Gijón began to develop rapidly, growing out of the old city center, supported by the commercial links between the port of Gijón and the American colonies. In the 18th century, due to the French invasions, the wars and the financial trouble in the era, the development stopped until late in the century, when the Oviedo-Gijón road was created and the port was recognized as the best one in Asturias, favoring the start of industrial activities in the town.

===Contemporary history===
[[File:Puerto Gijón.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting the port published in 1884]]
The 19th century brought with it great development, with the commerce of coal, the Gijón–[[León, Spain|León]] road and later the [[Langreo]]–Gijón railway. All this contributed to the quick expansion of the port, since the intensity of the traffic overflowed the port. A new port, [[El Musel]], was built in 1893 and it was the first coal port of the peninsula.

Gijón was going through a conversion to an industrial town with a new bourgeois and an urban development, opening new streets and squares, with new municipal equipments like water, garbage collection, lighting, and so on. All this industrial development brought new manpower to the city and the creation of new neighborhoods like Natahoyo, La Calzada, [[Tremañes]] or El Humedal.

In the 20th century, with the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city supported the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]]. The army was located in El Coto. The resistance was eliminated in August 1936. Later, the village was the capital of the [[Sovereign Council of Asturias and León]] until 20 October 1937, when the troops of General [[Francisco Franco]] occupied the city.

Iron manufacture was the main industry of Gijón from the last years of the 19th century until the last decades of the 20th. Uninsa was created in 1971, and it merged with Ensidesa. In the last years of the century was converted in [[Aceralia]], and integrated in [[Arcelor]], along with the Luxembourg-based [[ARBED|Arbed]] and the French company [[Usinor]].<!--[[File:Elogio chillida gijon.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Eulogy to the Horizon'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]], one of the most known symbols of Gijón.]]--> The last decades of the century brought an industrial crisis affecting mainly iron manufacture and local shipbuilding. This brought new terrain for the creation of new beaches, parks and neighborhoods. It was also created a campus of the [[University of Oviedo]].

=== Location ===
The city is situated on the coast of central Asturias, from sea level to an altitude of {{convert|513|m|abbr=on}} at ''Picu Samartín'' and {{convert|672|m|abbr=on}} at [[Peña de los Cuatro Jueces]], bordered on the West by [[Carreño]], the East by [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]], and to the South by [[Siero]] and [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]].

The city is situated along the Asturian coast and is distinguished by the peninsula of [[Cimavilla]] (the original settlement) which separates the beach of San Lorenzo and adjacent neighborhoods to the east from the beaches of Poniente and Arbeyal, the shipyards, and the recreational port and the Port of [[El Musel]] to the west. It is close to the other main Asturian cities, [[Oviedo]] and [[Avilés]].

=== Climate ===
Gijón has a temperate [[oceanic climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=41080&cityname=Gijon%2C+Principado+de+Asturias%2C+Spain&units=|title=Gijon, Spain Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|access-date=22 July 2015}}</ref> ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') typical of the Atlantic coast of Spain, with cool summers and wet and mostly mild winters. The onshore flow from the Atlantic Ocean creates a cool summer and mild winter climate where severe heat and very cold temperatures are rare. The narrow temperature range is demonstrated by the record August temperature being only 6.4&nbsp;°C warmer than the all-time record January temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=ast&l=1208&datos=det&x=1208&m=13&v=TMX|title=Extreme values for Gijón|publisher=Aemet.es|access-date=22 July 2015}}</ref> The climate is wet and cloudy by Spanish standards, but is indeed drier than other locations on the Atlantic in the country. Humidity is high year-round.

Summer temperatures are very consistent as proven by the fact that the all-time warmest month of August 1997 had an average temperature of {{convert|20.9|C|F}} and no month has ever been recorded at an average high above {{convert|24.7|C|F}} in comparison to the {{convert|23.2|C|F}} August normal high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=ast&l=1208&datos=det&x=1208&m=8&v=TMMA|title=Extreme Values: Gijón|publisher=Aemet.es|access-date=22 July 2015}}</ref> Another clear underlining of the marine influence is that the coolest ever August has been as near the average as {{convert|17.9|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=ast&l=1208&datos=det&x=1208&m=13&v=TMMA|title=Extreme values: Gijón|publisher=Aemet.es|access-date=22 July 2015}}</ref>

== Demography ==

According to the 2021 Municipal Population Register (INE), the council had 268,896 inhabitants, of which 142,411 are women and 126,485 are men.<ref>{{cite web |title=Asturias: Población por municipios y sexo. |url=https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=2886 |website=ine.es |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística |access-date=16 November 2022 |language=es}}</ref>

The municipal population grew remarkably throughout the 20th century, especially between the 1960s and 1980s, a period in which it doubled. Starting in the 1990s, growth stagnated, reflecting the similar slowdown at the national level of Spain. However, due to immigration, both from other Asturias councils and from abroad, the population started to increase again at the turn of the 21st century.

== Culture ==
[[File:024 Plaza del Marqués (Gijón), amb el Palacio de Revillagigedo i la Fuente de Pelayo edited.jpg|thumb|Revillagigedo barroque Palace]]
[[File:Universidad Laboral gijon (cropped).jpg|thumb|Old Universidad Laboral, today ''LABoral Ciudad de la Cultura'', biggest building in Spain]]
Cultural activities are carried out throughout the year, which increase considerably in the summer months, especially in August due to the Feast of the Assumption, with parties, music and theater. This complements the continuous programming of the Teatro Municipal Jovellanos (Jovellanos Municipal Theater). The various festivities carried out in Gijón include:

* The Iberoamerican Book Fair, in May
* The [[Semana Negra]] in July
* The Feria Internacional de Muestras de Asturias
* The [[Gijón International Film Festival]]
* The Semana Mágica Festival, in December.

The [[Universidad Laboral de Gijón]], completed in 1955, contains the [[LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial]] (Laboral Center of Art and Industrial Creation). The center was inaugurated on March 30, 2007 as an interdisciplinary space to promote artistic exchange and foster the relationship between society, art, science, technology and the creative industries.

In recent years, Gijón has become a stop city for the [[Cirque du Soleil]]. The performances of the Cirque du Soleil have been very successful in the city. In July 2004, Saltimbanco arrived and in the summer of 2007, they presented Alegría in Gijón, the first time that this tour stopped in northern Spain. During the summer of 2009, Cirque du Soleil returned to Gijón with the Varekai show.

Gijón is the birth place of several notable people, like [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], statesman, author, philosopher and a major figure of the Age of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

=== Film ===

The film would later win an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. In the early 1990s there was a boom in indie music bands in the town, which became known as the "Xixón Sound". The comedy [[Mortadelo & Filemon: The Big Adventure]] was also filmed in part in the City of Culture of Gijón. In 2009, the Laboral and its surroundings were converted to the University of Oxford for Fernando González Molina's film, [[Brain Drain (film)|Brain Drain]].

Amalia Ulman’s 2021 film “El Planeta” was shot in and discusses Gijon.
