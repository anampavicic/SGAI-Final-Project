==Etymology==
According to one popular tale, Thomas Wilkinson, who was a British captain, choose Archi (an Oraon tribal village) as headquarters. ''Archi'' means Bamboo forest in local [[Sadri language|Nagpuri dialect]]. The British inadvertently named "Archi" as "Ranchi". Captain Wilkinson renamed Kishunpur village as Rachi. Up to 1927, the place was known as Rachi.<ref name="focusmagazine">{{cite web|url=https://www.focusmagazine.in/1800s-when-british-developed-ranchi-as-summer-capital/|title=1800s: When British Developed Ranchi As Summer Capital|website=focusmagazine|date=13 August 2018|access-date=16 January 2020}}</ref><ref>Cultural Configuration of Ranchi,                                                       Lalita Prasad Vidyarthi, Rajendra Behari Lal, India.

In his book ''The Mundas and Their Country'', anthropologist [[Sarat Chandra Roy]] writes that the name of the city is derived from the [[Mundari language|Mundari]] word ''aranchi'' or "short stick" used in driving cattle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roy|first=Sarat Chandra|title=The Mundas and Their Country|publisher=Jogendra Nath Sarkar at City Book Society|year=1912|location= Calcutta.|pages=142–143 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzIkAAAAMAAJ }} [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.215493/page/n176/ Alt URL]</ref> while other opined that ''aranchi'' is bi-weekly market.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Misra |first1=R.

According to another local story, the name of Ranchi comes from a local bird named "Rici" which was mostly found in the [[Pahari Mandir]] premise.{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}  ''Rici'' is name for Black Kite ''([[Black kite|Milvus migrans]]'') in Mundari language, the modern-day landmark of Ranchi city, the Pahari Mandir, is also known as ''Rici Buru'' (रिचि बुरु) - the hill of the kites,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sylvan tales : stories from the Munda country|last=Samar|first=Bosu Mullick|isbn=9789384465056|location=Kolkata, India|publisher=Adivaani|oclc=935915532|year = 2015}}</ref> and the city originated on the foothills of Rici Buru with the construction of ''Bada Talab'' by Commissioner Thomas Wilkinson at the same site.

After the [[Battle of Buxar]], Nagvanshi became a vassal of the [[East India Company]].

==Geography==
Ranchi lies at {{Coord|23.36|N|85.33|E|format=dms}} near the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. The city covers an area of {{convert|175|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}<ref name='RMC'/> and its average elevation is 651&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]. Ranchi is located in the southern part of the [[Chota Nagpur plateau]], which is the eastern section of the Deccan plateau.

Ranchi has a hilly topography and its dense tropical forests a combination that produces a relatively moderate climate compared to the rest of the state. However, due to the uncontrolled deforestation and development of the city, the average temperature has increased.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Sultry-weather-likely-to-continue-in-city-for-now/articleshow/52662846.cms|title=Sultry weather likely to continue in city, for now – Times of India|website=[[The Times of India]]|access-date=2016-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619080252/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Sultry-weather-likely-to-continue-in-city-for-now/articleshow/52662846.cms|archive-date=19 June 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Climate===
Although Ranchi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen Climate Classification]]: ''Cwa''), its location and the forests surrounding it combine to produce the unusually pleasant climate for which it is known. Summer temperatures range from 20 to 42&nbsp;°C, winter temperatures from 0 to 25&nbsp;°C. December and January are the coolest months, with temperatures dipping to the freezing point in some areas ([[Kanker district|Kanke]]). The annual rainfall is about 1,430&nbsp;mm (56.34&nbsp;inches). From June to September the rainfall is about 1,100&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=590752&cityname=Ranchi,%20Jharkhand,%20India&units=|title=Ranchi, India Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)}}</ref>
