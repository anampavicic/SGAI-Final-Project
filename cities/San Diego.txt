==Name==

=== Etymology ===
San Diego's name can be traced back to the 16th century when Spanish explorer [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] bestowed it upon the area in 1602. He named the bay and the surrounding area "San Diego de Alcalá" in honor of [[Didacus of Alcalá|Saint Didacus of Alcalá]].<ref name=":4" />

=== Kumeyaay Toponymy ===
Prior to the Spanish establishment of San Diego, the [[Kumeyaay]] town was called [[Kosa'aay]], meaning "drying out place" in the [[Kumeyaay language]].<ref name=":1" /> After the establishment of San Diego, the Kumeyaay called town and city ''Tepacul Watai'', meaning "Stacked Big".<ref>{{Cite web |title=San Diego in Kumiai - English-Kumiai Dictionary {{!}} Glosbe |url=https://glosbe.com/en/dih/San%20Diego |access-date=November 17, 2023 |website=glosbe.com |language=en}}</ref> [[Luiseño language|Luiseño]] speakers in the [[North County (San Diego area)|North County region]] called it ''Pushuyi''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pushuyi in Spanish - Luiseno-Spanish Dictionary {{!}} Glosbe |url=https://glosbe.com/lui/es/Pushuyi |access-date=November 17, 2023 |website=glosbe.com |language=en}}</ref>

The permanent [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of both California and San Diego began in 1769 with the arrival of four contingents of Spaniards from New Spain and the [[Baja California]] peninsula. Two seaborne parties reached San Diego Bay: the ''San Carlos'', under Vicente Vila and including as notable members the engineer and cartographer [[Miguel Costansó]] and the soldier and future governor [[Pedro Fages]], and the ''San Antonio'', under [[Juan José Pérez Hernández|Juan Pérez]]. An initial overland expedition to San Diego from the south was led by the soldier [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Fernando Rivera]] and included the [[Franciscan]] missionary, explorer, and chronicler [[Juan Crespí]], followed by a second party led by the designated governor [[Gaspar de Portolà]] and including the mission president (and now saint) [[Junípero Serra]].<ref>Pourade, Richard F. 1960.

===Mexican period===
[[File:José_María_Estudillo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[José María Estudillo]] served as commandant of the [[Presidio of San Diego]] and founded the [[Estudillo family of California|Estudillo family]], a powerful clan of [[Californio]]s.]]
In 1821, Mexico [[Mexican War of Independence|won its independence from Spain]], and San Diego became part of the Mexican territory of [[Alta California]]. In 1822, Mexico began its attempt to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularized by the Mexican government in 1834]], and most of the Mission lands were granted to former soldiers. The 432 [[Vecino|residents]] of the town petitioned the governor to form a [[Cabildo (council)|pueblo]], and [[Juan María Osuna]] was elected the first ''[[alcalde]]'' ("municipal magistrate"), defeating [[Pío Pico]] in the vote. Beyond the town, Mexican [[land grant]]s expanded the number of [[Ranchos of California|California ranchos]] that modestly added to the local economy. (See, ''[[List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego]]''.)

However, San Diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s, due to increasing tension between the settlers and the indigenous [[Kumeyaay]] and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/timeline/timeline1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224204925/https://www.sandiegohistory.org/timeline/timeline1.htm|archive-date=December 24, 2015|title=Timeline of San Diego History {{!}} San Diego History Center|date=December 24, 2015|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref> The [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] in the San Diego region would face Kumeyaay raids in the late 1830s and the town itself would face raids in the 1840s.<ref>Connolly, Mike.

Americans gained an increased awareness of California, and its commercial possibilities, from the writings of two countrymen involved in the often officially forbidden, to foreigners, but economically significant hide and tallow trade, where San Diego was a major port and the only one with an adequate harbor: [[William Shaler]]'s "Journal of a Voyage Between China and the North-Western Coast of America, Made in 1804" and [[Richard Henry Dana Jr.|Richard Henry Dana]]'s more substantial and convincing account, of his 1834–36 voyage, the classic ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bean |first=Walton |title=California: An Interpretive History |date=1973 |edition=Second |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/californiainterp00bean/page/74 74–76] |isbn=978-0-07-004224-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/californiainterp00bean/page/74 }}</ref>

In 1846, the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land [[Conquest of California|expedition to conquer Alta California]]. At first, they had an easy time of it, capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in [[Los Angeles]], the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1, the American garrison learned that the dragoons of General [[Stephen W. Kearney]] were at [[Warner's Ranch]]. Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain [[Archibald Gillespie]] to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under [[Andrés Pico]]. 
[[File:Battle of San Pasqual by William H Meyers c1846.jpg|thumb|right|The 1846 [[Battle of San Pasqual]] was a decisive battle between American and [[Californio]] forces.]]
In the ensuing [[Battle of San Pasqual]], fought in the [[San Pasqual Valley]] which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sandiegohistory.org/journal/2003/january/war-2/|first=Richard|last=Griswold del Castillo|title=The U.S.-Mexican War in San Diego, 1846–1847 |work=San Diego Historical Society Quarterly |date=Winter 2003|volume=49|issue=1}}</ref> Stockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the "[[Treaty of Cahuenga]]" on January 13, 1847. As a result of the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–48, the territory of Alta California, including San Diego, was ceded to the United States by Mexico, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848. The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was "for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco", and the Mexican–American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of [[San Diego Bay]], so as to include the entire bay within the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Griswold de Castillo|1990|page=39}}</ref>

===American period===
[[File:San Diego California Looking East Across the Bay by Alfred Mathews 1873.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[San Diego Bay]] in 1873 following the [[conquest of California|U.S. conquest of California]]]]
The state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850. That same year San Diego was designated the seat of the newly established County of San Diego and was incorporated as a city. [[Joshua H. Bean]], the last alcalde of San Diego, was elected the first mayor.

The original town of San Diego was located at the foot of Presidio Hill, in the area which is now [[Old Town San Diego State Historic Park]]. The location was not ideal, being several miles away from navigable water at its port at [[La Playa, San Diego|La Playa]]. In 1850, [[William Heath Davis]] promoted a new development by the bay shore called "New San Diego", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier, a few houses and an [[San Diego Barracks|Army depot]] for the support of [[Fort Yuma]]. After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by [[Steamboats of the Colorado River|steamboats on the Colorado River]] and the depot fell into disuse. From 1857 to 1860, San Diego became the western terminus of the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]], the earliest overland [[stagecoach]] and mail operation from the [[Eastern United States]] to California, coming from [[Texas]] through [[New Mexico Territory]] in less than 30 days.<ref name = "Pierce">Basil C.

In the late 1860s, [[Alonzo Horton]] promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called "New Town" and which became [[downtown San Diego]]. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because its location on [[San Diego Bay]] was convenient to shipping. New Town soon eclipsed the original settlement, known to this day as [[Old Town, San Diego, California|Old Town]], and became the economic and governmental heart of the city.<ref name=Cornerstone>{{harvnb|Engstrand|2005|page=80}}</ref> Still, San Diego remained a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878. In 1884–1886, [[John J.

In 1912, San Diego was the site of a [[San Diego free speech fight|free speech fight]] between the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and the city government who passed an ordinance forbidding the [[freedom of speech]] along an area of "Soapbox Row" that led to civil disobedience, [[vigilantism]], [[police violence]], the abduction of [[Emma Goldman]]'s husband [[Ben Reitman]] and [[San Diego free speech fight|multiple riots]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hall|first=Matthew T.|date=February 8, 2012|title=100 years ago, San Diego banned free speech|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-100-years-ago-san-diego-banned-free-speech-2012feb08-story.html|access-date=July 9, 2021|website=San Diego Union-Tribune|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Dotinga|first=Randy|date=March 15, 2011|title=When San Diego Had Its Own Big Labor Clash|url=https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/when-san-diego-had-its-own-big-labor-clash/|access-date=July 9, 2021|website=Voice of San Diego|language=en-US}}</ref> San Diego's proximity to Tijuana during the [[Mexican Revolution]] made this one of the most significant [[free speech fights]] during the [[Wobbly]] era.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Waller|first=Tom|date=April 2, 1992|title=The Wobblies and San Diego's shame {{!}} San Diego Reader|url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1992/apr/02/battle-soapbox-row/|access-date=July 9, 2021|website=San Diego Reader|language=en}}</ref>

In the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted the [[World's Fair]] twice: the [[Panama–California Exposition]] in 1915 and the [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in 1935. Both expositions were held in [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair.

During [[World War II]], San Diego became a major hub of military and defense activity, due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers. The city's population grew rapidly during and after World War II, more than doubling between 1930 (147,995) and 1950 (333,865).<ref name="RM 54">Moffatt, Riley.

The [[San Diego River]] runs through the middle of San Diego from east to west, creating a river valley that serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments. During the historic period and presumably earlier as well, the river has shifted its flow back and forth between San Diego Bay and Mission Bay, and its [[fresh water]] was the focus of the earliest Spanish explorers. [[Miguel Costansó]], a cartographer, wrote in 1769, "When asked by signs where the watering-place was, the Indians pointed to a grove which could be seen at a considerable distance to the northeast, giving to understand that a river or creek flowed through it, and that they would lead our men to it if they would follow."<ref name=":0">"Expeditions by Sea" ''The Explorers''.

Notable peaks within the city limits include [[Cowles Mountain]], the highest point in the city at {{convert|1591|ft|m}};<ref name="city data"/> [[Black Mountain Open Space Park|Black Mountain]] at {{convert|1558|ft|m}}; and [[Mount Soledad]] at {{convert|824|ft|m}}. The [[Cuyamaca Mountains]] and Laguna Mountains rise to the east of the city, and beyond the mountains are desert areas. The [[Cleveland National Forest]] is a half-hour drive from downtown San Diego. Numerous farms are found in the valleys northeast and southeast of the city.

The climate in San Diego, like most of Southern California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances, resulting in [[microclimate]]s. In San Diego, this is mostly because of the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the "May gray/[[June Gloom|June gloom]]" period, a thick "[[marine layer]]" cloud cover keeps the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but yields to bright cloudless sunshine approximately {{convert|5|–|10|mi|km|0}} inland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meteora.ucsd.edu/cap/gloom.html |title=UCSD |publisher=Meteora.ucsd.edu |date=May 14, 2010 |access-date=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613050427/http://meteora.ucsd.edu/cap/gloom.html |archive-date=June 13, 2010 }}</ref> Sometimes the June gloom lasts into July, causing cloudy skies over most of San Diego for the entire day.<ref name=weather1>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/USca0982|title=Monthly Averages for San Diego, CA|access-date=April 22, 2009|publisher=[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502201247/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/USCA0982|archive-date=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref name=weather_el_cajon>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/92020|title=Monthly Averages for El Cajon, CA|access-date=April 22, 2009|publisher=[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604055354/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/92020|archive-date=June 4, 2011}}</ref> Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. Thus, for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of {{convert|50|F|C}} and August highs of {{convert|78|F|C}}. The city of [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]], just {{convert|12|mi|km}} inland from downtown San Diego, averages January lows of {{convert|42|F|C}} and August highs of {{convert|88|F|C}}.

The average surface temperature of the water at Scripps Pier in the [[California Current]] has increased by almost {{convert|3|F-change}} since 1950, according to scientists at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Lee, Mike|title=Is global warming changing California Current?|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/jun/18/taking-stock-california-current/|date=June 18, 2011|work=U-T (San Diego Union Tribune)|access-date=June 20, 2011}}</ref> Additionally, the mean minimum is now above {{convert|40|F|C}}, putting San Diego in [[hardiness zone]] 11, with the last freeze having occurred many decades ago.

Rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of San Diego; some of the higher areas can receive {{convert|11|-|15|in|mm}} per year. Variability from year to year can be dramatic: in the wettest years of 1883/1884 and 1940/1941, more than {{convert|24|in|mm|-1}} fell, whilst in the driest years there was as little as {{convert|3.2|in|mm|-1}}. The wettest month on record is December 1921 with {{convert|9.21|in|mm|0}}.

Snow in the city is rare, having been observed only six times in the century and a half that records have been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow remained on the ground for a few hours in higher locations like [[Point Loma, San Diego|Point Loma]] and [[La Jolla]].

Altogether the city contains more than 100 identified [[Neighborhoods of San Diego, California|neighborhoods]].

[[Downtown San Diego]] is located on [[San Diego Bay]]. [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] encompasses several mesas and canyons to the northeast, surrounded by older, dense urban communities including [[Hillcrest, San Diego|Hillcrest]] and [[North Park, San Diego|North Park]]. To the east and southeast lie [[City Heights, San Diego|City Heights]], the [[College Area]], and [[Southeast San Diego]]. To the north lies [[Mission Valley]] and [[Interstate 8]]. The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar]], include [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], [[Kearny Mesa]], [[Tierrasanta]], and [[Navajo, San Diego|Navajo]]. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of [[Mira Mesa]], [[Scripps Ranch]], [[Rancho Peñasquitos]], and [[Rancho Bernardo]]. The far northeast portion of the city encompasses [[Lake Hodges]] and the [[San Pasqual Valley]], which holds an agricultural preserve. [[Carmel Valley, San Diego|Carmel Valley]] and [[Del Mar Heights, San Diego|Del Mar Heights]] occupy the northwest corner of the city. To their south are [[Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve]] and the business center of the [[Golden Triangle, San Diego|Golden Triangle]]. Further south are the beach and coastal communities of [[La Jolla]], [[Pacific Beach, San Diego|Pacific Beach]], [[Mission Beach, San Diego|Mission Beach]], and [[Ocean Beach, San Diego|Ocean Beach]]. [[Point Loma]] occupies the peninsula across San Diego Bay from downtown. The communities of [[South San Diego]] (an [[Exclave]]), such as [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] and [[Otay Mesa]], are located next to the [[Mexico–United States border]], and are physically separated from the rest of the city by the cities of [[National City, California|National City]] and [[Chula Vista]]. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/how-san-ysidro-became-part-of-the-city-of-san-diego/|title=How San Ysidro Became Part of the City of San Diego|date=May 8, 2019|website=Voice of San Diego|language=en-US|access-date=December 9, 2019}}</ref>

San Diego was originally centered on the [[Old Town, San Diego|Old Town]] district, but by the late 1860s the focus had shifted to the bayfront, in the belief that this new location would increase trade. As the "New Town" – present-day Downtown – waterfront location quickly developed, it eclipsed Old Town as the center of San Diego.<ref name=Cornerstone />

According to data from the Downtown San Diego Partnership, the number of individuals living outside or in vehicles has reached a two-year low, standing at approximately 1,200 as of last month. The decrease is attributed to the implementation of the city's camping ban and the concerted efforts to establish new shelters. While enforcement has led to relatively few individuals being punished, the threat of legal consequences appears to have played a role in the reduction.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nelson |first=Blake |date=December 12, 2023 |title=The homeless population downtown just hit a two-year low.

Television stations today include [[XHCPDE-TDT|XHCPDE]] 11 ([[Canal Once (Mexico)]]), [[XETV-TDT|XETV]] 6 ([[Canal 5 (Mexico)|Canal 5]]/[[Nueve (Mexican TV network)|Nueve]]), [[KFMB-TV|KFMB]] 8 ([[CBS]], with [[The CW]]/[[MyNetworkTV|MNTV]] on DT2), [[KGTV]] 10 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[XEWT-TDT|XEWT]] 12 ([[Televisa Regional]]), [[KPBS (TV)|KPBS]] 15 ([[PBS]]), [[KBNT-CD]] 17 ([[Univision]]), [[XHTIT-TDT]] 21 ([[Azteca 7]]), [[XHJK-TDT]] 1 ([[Azteca Uno]]), [[XHAS-TDT|XHAS]] 33 ([[Canal 66]]), [[K35DG-D]] 35 ([[UCSD-TV]]), [[KDTF-LD]] 36 ([[Unimás]]), [[KNSD]] 39 ([[NBC]]), [[KUAN-LD]] 48 ([[Telemundo]]), [[KSEX-CD]] 42 (Infomercials), [[XHBJ-TDT]] 45 ([[Canal 6 (Mexico)]]), [[XHDTV-TDT|XHDTV]] 49 ([[Milenio Televisión]]), [[KUSI]] 51 (Independent), [[XHUAA-TDT]] 19 ([[Canal de las Estrellas]]), and [[KSWB-TV]] 69 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]).

Due to the ratio of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest [[media market]] in the United States that is legally unable to support a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|television station duopoly]] between two full-power stations under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require that there would be eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).<ref>[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/1999/nrmm9019.html "FCC revives local television ownership rules"]. ''[[Federal Communications Commission]]''. August 5, 1999.</ref> Though the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power]] television stations in the same market is permitted regardless of the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly ([[Entravision Communications]] owns both [[XHAS-TV]] and XHDTV-TV, [[Azteca (multimedia company)|Azteca]] owns [[XHJK-TV]] and [[XHTIT-TV]], and [[Televisa|Grupo Televisa]] owns [[XHUAA-TV]] and [[XEWT-TDT|XEWT-TV]] along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary [[Bay City Television]]).

San Diego's television market is limited to only [[San Diego County]]. The [[Imperial County, California|Imperial Valley]], including [[El Centro]], is in the [[Yuma, Arizona]], television market while neighboring [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] counties are part of the Los Angeles market. (Sometimes, in the past, a missing network affiliate in the Imperial Valley would be available on cable TV from San Diego.) As a result, San Diego is the largest single-county media market in the United States.

The radio stations in San Diego include nationwide broadcaster [[iHeartMedia]], [[Audacy, Inc.]], Local Media San Diego, and many other smaller stations and networks. Stations include: [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO AM 600]], [[KGB (AM)|KGB AM 760]], [[KCEO|KCEO AM 1000]], [[KCBQ|KCBQ AM 1170]], [[KPRZ|K-Praise]], [[KLSD|KLSD AM 1360]], [[KFSD|KFSD 1450 AM]], [[KPBS-FM]] 89.5, [[KHTS-FM|Channel 933]], [[KMYI|Star 94.1]], [[KBZT|FM 94/9]], [[KSSX|FM News and Talk 95.7]], [[KYDO|Q96]] 96.1, [[KYXY|KyXy]] 96.5, [[Free Radio San Diego]] (AKA [[Pirate Radio]] San Diego) 96.9FM FRSD, [[KWFN]] 97.3, [[KXSN]] 98.1, [[KFBG (FM)|Big-FM 100.7]], 101.5 [[KGB-FM]], [[KLVJ (FM)|KLVJ]] 102.1, [[KSON (FM)|KSON]] 103.7, [[KIOZ|Rock 105.3]], and another ''[[Pirate Radio]]'' station at 106.9FM, as well as a number of local Spanish-language radio stations.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{main|Transportation in San Diego|Streets and highways of San Diego}}
[[File:Union Station, San Diego (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Santa Fe Depot (San Diego)|Santa Fe Depot]] is served by [[Amtrak California]] and [[Coaster (rail service)|Coaster]] trains.]]
With the automobile being the primary means of transportation for over 80 percent of residents, San Diego is served by a network of freeways and highways. This includes [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate&nbsp;5]], which runs south to [[Tijuana]] and north to Los Angeles; [[Interstate 8]], which runs east to [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]] and the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]]; Interstate&nbsp;15, which runs northeast through the [[Inland Empire]] to [[Las Vegas]] and [[Salt Lake City]]; and [[Interstate 805]], which splits from I-5 near the Mexican border and rejoins I-5 at [[Sorrento Valley, San Diego|Sorrento Valley]].

Major state highways include [[California State Route 94|SR&nbsp;94]], which connects downtown with I-805, I-15 and [[East County, San Diego|East County]]; [[California State Route 163|SR&nbsp;163]], which connects downtown with the northeast part of the city, intersects I-805 and merges with I-15 at [[Miramar, San Diego|Miramar]]; [[California State Route 52|SR&nbsp;52]], which connects La Jolla with [[East County, San Diego|East County]] through [[Santee, California|Santee]] and [[California State Route 125|SR&nbsp;125]]; [[California State Route 56|SR&nbsp;56]], which connects I-5 with I-15 through [[Carmel Valley, San Diego|Carmel Valley]] and [[Rancho Peñasquitos, San Diego|Rancho Peñasquitos]]; [[California State Route 75|SR 75]], which spans [[San Diego Bay]] as the [[San Diego–Coronado Bridge]], and also passes through [[South San Diego]] as Palm Avenue; and [[California State Route 905|SR&nbsp;905]], which connects I-5 and I-805 to the [[Otay Mesa Port of Entry]].
[[File:MTSgreenline-convctr (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[San Diego Trolley]] is operated by the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System|S.D. Metropolitan Transit System]].]]
The stretch of SR&nbsp;163 that passes through Balboa Park is San Diego's oldest freeway, dating back to 1948 when it was part of [[U.S. Route 80 in California|US&nbsp;80]] and [[U.S. Route 395 in California|US&nbsp;395]]. It has been called one of America's most beautiful parkways.<ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tG3asbfLcUsC&dq=163+beautiful+diego&pg=PA110 |title=San Diego's Balboa Park |series=Postcard History Series |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-7385-4754-1}}</ref>

San Diego's roadway system provides an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to [[utility cycling]]. This is partly because the grid street patterns are now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban-style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, the majority of cycling is recreational.
[[File:CBX exterior.jpg|thumb|The [[Cross Border Xpress]], also known as the ''Puerta de [[las Californias]]'', connects San Diego to [[Tijuana International Airport]] in [[Baja California]].]]

The Amtrak and Coaster trains currently run along the coastline and connect San Diego with Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura via [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] and the Pacific Surfliner. There are two Amtrak stations in San Diego, in [[Old Town Transit Center|Old Town]] and [[Santa Fe Depot (San Diego)|Santa Fe Depot]] downtown.

Recent regional transportation projects have sought to mitigate congestion, including improvements to local freeways, expansion of San Diego Airport, and doubling the capacity of the cruise ship terminal. Freeway projects included expansion of Interstates 5 and 805 around "The Merge" where these two freeways meet, as well as expansion of Interstate 15 through North County, which includes new [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV "managed lanes"]]. A tollway (the southern portion of SR 125, known as the South Bay Expressway) connects SR 54 and Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border. According to an assessment in 2007, 37 percent of city streets were in acceptable condition. However, the proposed budget fell $84.6&nbsp;million short of bringing streets up to an acceptable level.<ref name="37perStreets">{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Hall|title=City: 37 percent of streets in acceptable driving condition|newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=May 2, 2007|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20070502-1610-bn02streets.html|access-date=April 22, 2009}}</ref> Expansion at the port has included a second cruise terminal on [[Broadway Pier, San Diego|Broadway Pier]], opened in 2010.

===Utilities===
Water is supplied to residents by the Water Department of the City of San Diego. The city receives most of its water from the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]], which brings water to the region from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, via the state project and the Colorado River, via the Colorado Aqueduct.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MWD {{!}} Securing Our Imported Supplies |url=https://www.mwdh2o.com/securing-our-imported-supplies/ |access-date=December 16, 2023 |website=www.mwdh2o.com}}</ref>

====Street lights====
[[File:Sandiego gaslampquarter (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Street lights in the [[Gaslamp Quarter]]]]
In the mid-20th century the city had [[mercury vapor]] street lamps. In 1978, the city decided to replace them with more efficient [[sodium vapor]] lamps. This triggered an outcry from [[astronomer]]s at [[Palomar Observatory]] {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1}} north of the city, concerned that the new lamps would increase [[light pollution]] and hinder astronomical observation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/14/us/astronomers-say-street-lights-will-blind-palomar.html|title=Astronomers say street lights will blind Palomar|last=Blakeslee|first=Sandra|date=August 14, 1983|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 20, 2014}}</ref> The city altered its lighting regulations to limit light pollution within {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of Palomar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/pdf/cpc/agendas/attachments/outdoorlighting.pdf|title=Outdoor lighting regulations|work=City of San Diego|access-date=February 20, 2014|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114654/http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/pdf/cpc/agendas/attachments/outdoorlighting.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2011, the city announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient lights that use [[Electrodeless lamp|induction technology]], a modified form of [[fluorescent lamp]] producing a broader spectrum than sodium vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2&nbsp;million per year in energy and maintenance.<ref name="install">{{cite news|url=http://www.sdgln.com/news/2011/09/19/san-diego-install-brighter-more-efficient-streetlights|title=San Diego to install brighter, more efficient streetlights|date=September 19, 2011|work=San Diego Gay & Lesbian News|access-date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> The city stated the changes would "make our neighborhoods safer."<ref name = "install" /> They also increase [[light pollution]].<ref>[http://www.sandiego.gov/street-div/services/electrical/strlight.shtml City of San Diego official website, "Street Division: Electrical Street Lights"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221083431/http://www.sandiego.gov/street-div/services/electrical/strlight.shtml |date=February 21, 2014 }} Retrieved February 15, 2014</ref>

In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, using an "intelligent" lighting system to control 3,000 [[LED]] street lights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dailyfusion.net/2014/01/san-diego-to-link-street-lights-to-industrial-internet-26286/|title=San Diego to Link Street Lights to Industrial Internet|work=Daily Fusion|access-date=January 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202175840/http://dailyfusion.net/2014/01/san-diego-to-link-street-lights-to-industrial-internet-26286/|archive-date=February 2, 2014}}</ref>
