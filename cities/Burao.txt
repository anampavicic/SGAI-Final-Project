For much of the 19th century, Burao served as the capital of the [[Habr Yunis Sultanate]]. Sultan [[Nur Ahmed Aman]], Sutan [[Awad Deria]] and Sultan [[Madar Hersi]] ruled from Burao at different periods of time.<ref>British SomaliLand by Ralph E Drake Brockman, p.66</ref><ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, By Frank Linsly james, p.62</ref>

<blockquote>After leaving the Berbera coastlands and ascending the escarpments of the great inland plateau, the convoy followed the valley of the Tug Dayr as far as Burao, capital of a powerful but friendly Habr Gerhaji sultan.<ref>The Academy, Volume 35, 1889, p.126</ref></blockquote>
 
Explorer [[Frank Linsly James]], a guest of Sultan [[Awad Diiriye]] during his visit to Somaliland in 1884, describes a performance he witnessed by Habr Yunis Horsemen at Burao's [[Togdheer River]].

<blockquote>During our stay at Burao, the Sultan collected a great many of his people together, and twice entertained us with some well-executed and characteristic evolutions on horseback. On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second "fan- tasia", in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remount- ing. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout "Mort, mort" ("Welcome, welcome"), to which we replied, "Kul liban" ("Thanks").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, By Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>

===Dervish movement===

The Dervish movement was founded in Burao in 1899. In the end of late August of that year the Dervish leaders and their clan followers assembled at Burao, [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] with his followers from the [[Dhulbahante]], the various [[Habr Je'lo|Habar Jeclo]] sub clans with their principle headman [[Haji Sudi]], and [[Nur Ahmed Aman|Sultan Nur Ahmed Aman]] with his followers from the [[Habr Yunis]] clan, declared open hostility.<ref>Sessional papers Volume 48 p. 8</ref> The assembled dervish and their clan allies sent the following stern letter to Captain Cordeauxe and James Hayes Sadler:
<blockquote>
"This is to inform you that you have done whatever you have desired, and oppressed our well-known religion without any cause. Further, to inform you that whatever people bring to you they are liars and slanderers. Further, to inform you that Mahomed, your Akil, came to ask from us the arms we therefore, send you this letter. Now choose for yourself; if you want war we accept it, if you want peace pay the fine." September 1, 1899.<ref>Sessional papers Volume 48. p. 15</ref>
</blockquote>

===Burao tax revolt and RAF bombing===

{{main|1922 Burao Tax Revolt}}

[[File:Captainallangibb.jpg|thumb|Captain Allan Gibb]]

The people of Burao clashed with the British in 1922 after a heavy tax was imposed upon them. They revolted in opposition to the tax and this caused them to riot and attack British government officials. In the ensuing disturbances a shootout between the British and Burao residents broke out; Captain Allan Gibb, a Dervish war veteran and district commissioner, was shot and killed. The British, fearing they could not contain the revolt, requested that [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] Sir [[Winston Churchill]] send troops from [[Aden]] and [[Bomber|bomber aircraft]] in order to bomb Burao and the livestock of the revolting clans to quell any further rebellion.<ref>Colonial Office, 11 April 1922</ref> The RAF planes arrived at Burao within two days and proceeded to bomb the town with incendiaries, effectively burning the entire settlement to the ground.

Telegram from Sir [[Geoffrey Archer (colonial administrator)|Geoffrey Archer]], Governor of British Somaliland to [[Sir Winston Churchill]] the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]:
<blockquote>I deeply regret to inform that during an affray at Burao yesterday between Rer Sugulleh and Akils of other tribes Captain Gibb was shot dead. Having called out Camel corps company to quell the disturbance, he went forward himself with his interperter, whereupon fire opened on him by some Rer segulleh riflemen and he was instantly killed..Miscreants then disappeared under the cover of darkness.
In order to meet the situation created by the Murder of Gibb, we require two aeroplanes for about fourteen days. I have arranged with resident, Aden, for these. And made formal application, which please confirm. It is proposed they fly via Perim, confining sea crossing to 12 miles. We propose to inflict fine of 2,500 camels on implicated sections, who are practically isolated and demand surrender of man who killed Gibbs. He is known. Fine to be doubled in failure to comply with latter conditions and aeroplanes to be used to bomb stock on grazing grounds.<ref>Correspondence between Governor of British Somaliland and Secretary of State for the Colonies. Colonial Office, 28th February, 1922</ref></blockquote>

Sir [[Winston Churchill]] reporting on the Burao incident in the [[House of Commons]]:

<blockquote>On 25th February the [[Governor of Somaliland]] telegraphed that an affray between tribesmen had taken place at Burao on the previous day, in the course of which Captain Allan Gibb, D.S.O., D.C.M., the [[District Commissioner (British Colonial)|District Commissioner]] at Burao, had been shot dead. Captain Gibb had advanced with his interpreter to quell the disturbance, when 1954 fire was opened upon him by some riflemen, and he was instantly killed. The murderers escaped under cover of falling darkness.
Captain Gibb was an officer of long and valued service in Somaliland, whose loss I deeply regret. From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary in order to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, in order to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden. He also telegraphed that in certain circumstances it might become necessary to ask for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Protectorate.<ref>1922 Commons sitting. HC Deb 14 March 1922 vol 151 cc1953-4</ref></blockquote>

James Lawrence author of ''Imperial Rearguard: Wars of Empire'' writes

<blockquote>[Gibb]..was murdered by rioters during a protest against taxation at Burao. Governor Archer immediately called for aircraft which were at Burao within two days. The inhabitants of the native township were turned out of their houses, and the entire area was razed by a combination of bombing, machine-gun fire and burning.<ref>Imperial Rearguard: Wars of Empire, 1919–1985 pp.168</ref></blockquote>

After the RAF aircraft bombed Burao to the ground, the leaders of the rebellion acquiesced, agreeing to pay a fine for Gibb's death, but they refused to identify and apprehend the accused individuals. Most of the men responsible for Gibb's shooting evaded capture. In light of the failure to implement the taxation without provoking a violent response, the British abandoned the policy altogether.<ref>British Somaliland: An Administrative History, 1920–1960 pp.110</ref><ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tW_eEVbVxpEC&q=Gibbs&pg=PA991|title=Dictionary of battles and sieges P-Z, p.991|isbn=9780313335396|last1=Jaques|first1=Tony|year=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic }}</ref><ref name="corr 1922"/>

===1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion===

{{main|1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion}}

[[File:Sheikh Bashir praying.jpg|thumb|300px|Sheikh Bashir praying [[Sunnah prayer]], 1920]]

The 1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion was a rebellion waged by tribesmen of the [[Habr Je'lo]] clan in the former [[British Somaliland]] protectorate against British authorities in July 1945 led by [[Sheikh Bashir]], a [[Somalis|Somali]] religious leader.<ref name=":0">{{Cite thesis|title=Constructing colonial hegemony in the Somaliland protectorate, 1941-1960|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/14169|date=1996|degree=Thesis|first=Jama|last=Mohamed}}</ref>

On 2 July, Sheikh Bashir collected 25 of his followers in the town of [[Wadamago]] and transported them on a lorry to the vicinity of Burao, where he distributed arms to half of his followers. On the evening of 3 July, the group entered Burao and opened fire on the police guard of the central prison in the city, which was filled with prisoners arrested for previous demonstrations. The group also attacked the house of the district commissioner of [[Burao District]], Major Chambers, resulting in the death of Major Chamber's police guard before escaping to [[Buur Dhaab|Bur Dhab]], a strategic mountain south-east of Burao, where Sheikh Bashir's small unit occupied a fort and took up a defensive position in anticipation of a British counterattack.<ref>{{Cite book|last=of Rodd|first=Lord Rennell|title=British Military Administration in Africa 1941-1947|publisher=HMSO|year=1948|pages=481}}</ref>

The British campaign against Sheikh Bashir's troops proved abortive after several defeats as his forces kept moving from place to place and avoiding any permanent location. No sooner had the expedition left the area, than the news traveled fast among the Somali nomads across the plain. The war had exposed the British administration to humiliation. The government came to a conclusion that another expedition against him would be useless; that they must build a railway, make roads and effectively occupy the whole of the protectorate, or else abandon the interior completely. The latter course was decided upon, and during the first months of 1945, the advance posts were withdrawn and the British administration confined to the coast town of [[Berbera]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Taariikhdii Halgamaa: Sheekh Bashiir Sh.

Sheikh Bashir settled many disputes among the tribes in the vicinity, which kept them from raiding each other. He was generally thought to settle disputes through the use of Islamic [[Sharia]] and gathered around him a strong following.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Sheekh Caamir|first=Prof. Yaxye|date=11 January 2018|title=Taariikhdii Halgamaa: Sheekh Bashiir Sh. Yuusuf|journal=Laashin}}</ref>

The British administration recruited Indian and South African troops, led by police general James David, to fight against Sheikh Bashir and had intelligence plans to capture him alive. The British authorities mobilized a police force, and eventually on 7 July found Sheikh Bashir and his unit in defensive positions behind their fortifications in the mountains of Bur Dhab. After clashes Sheikh Bashir and his second-in-command, Alin Yusuf Ali, nicknamed Qaybdiid, were killed. A third rebel was wounded and was captured along with two other rebels. The rest fled the fortifications and dispersed. On the British side the police general leading the British troops as well as a number of Indian and South African troops perished in the clashes, and a policeman was injured.<ref name=":1" />

After his death, Sheikh Bashir was widely hailed by locals as a martyr and was held in great reverence. His family took quick action to remove his body from the place of his death at Geela-eeg mountain, about 20 miles from Burao.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Akyeampong|first1=Emmanuel.

=== Post-colonial ===

The town became a district capital and a number of public buildings were subsequently established in the following years. Burao's administrative importance declined after Hargeisa replaced Berbera as the capital of the British Somaliland protectorate in 1941, and Burao's urban infrastructure remained underdeveloped. However, with the expansion of the region's livestock trade in the 1950s the city once again began to grow. Serving as the most important regional market hub, where livestock from the [[Haud|Hawd]] region as well as the city's south-western hinterlands was assembled and exported to Saudi Arabia, Burao grew rapidly and replaced Berbera as the second largest city of the Protectorate.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web |date=2010 |title=LOCAL CAPACITIES FOR PEACE – Land-Based Conflict Project |url=https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/58088/1/final_report-final_2010_04_12.pdf |website=Cardiff University |pages=11–12}}</ref>

Burao's rapid growth continued after independence in 1960. Burao regained its administrative importance as it was made the capital of the Togdheer region, which at the time encompassed today's [[Togdheer]], [[Sool]] and [[Sanaag]] regions.<ref name=":03" /> Burao was also during this time the third largest city of [[Somalia]] after [[Mogadishu]] and Hargeisa.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=In the Valley of Death: Somaliland's Forgotten Genocide |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/in-the-valley-of-death-somalilands-forgotten-genocide/tnamp/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Tekle |first1=Amare |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC&dq=hargeisa+and+burao+second+and+third+largest+cities+somalia&pg=PA152 |title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: From Conflict to Cooperation |publisher=The Red Sea Press |year=1994 |isbn=9780932415974}}</ref>

With the opening of a local branch of the [[Economy of Somaliland|Somali Commercial Bank]], livestock traders gained access to credits and further expanded their business activities by investing their profits in the real estate market, further contributing to the development and growth of the city.<ref name=":03" /> Burao was reorganized and restructured massively during the 1970s, and with the migration of locals to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]], where the oil boom had opened up new job opportunities, Burao's vibrant land market was stimulated further as their savings were often invested in real estate.<ref name=":03" /> The city's growth was also caused by the development of its shoe industry and educational facilities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bohra |first=D.M. |date=1979 |title=Patterns of Urban Settlements in Somalia |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41142187 |journal=GeoJournal |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=63–68 |doi=10.1007/BF02484660 |jstor=41142187 |pmid=12263146 |issn=0343-2521}}</ref>

=== Somaliland War of Independence ===

{{Main|1988 Hargeisa-Burao offensive|Somaliland War of Independence}}

After Siad Barre took power in 1969, the Isaaq sub-clans felt more and more marginalized, as outsiders from the [[Darod|Darood]] clan dominated the political establishment of Burao. Most governors during Barre's time in office came from the South and belonged to Darood clans. Violent incidents against the Isaaq civilian population increased in the 1980s, which led to Isaaqs supporting the rebellion of the Somali National Movement.<ref name=":3" />

Following the first two days of the conflict, angered by the extent to which Isaaqs welcomed the SNM incursion, and frustrated by their inability to contain the SNM advance, the military started attacking the civilian population without restraint "as if it was the enemy".<ref name="HRW2" /> The military used "heavy artillery and tanks, causing severe damage, both to civilians and to property. [[Bazooka]]s, machine guns, hand grenades and other weapons of mass destruction were also directed against civilian targets in Hargeisa which had also been attacked as well as in Burao."<ref name="HRW2" />

A United States Congressional [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] team reported the Somali government's response to the SNM attack as follows:<blockquote>The Somali army reportedly responded to the SNM attacks in May 1988 with extreme force, inflicting heavy civilian casualties and damages to Hargeisa and Burao....The Somali military resorted to using artillery and aerial shelling in heavily populated urban centres in its effort to retake Burao and Hargeisa. A majority of the refugees we interviewed stated that their homes were destroyed by shelling despite the absence of SNM combatants from their neighbourhoods....The refugees told similar stories of bombings, strafings, and artillery shelling in both cities and, in Burao, the use of armored tanks.

They would shout, "Who is from [[Galkayo]]? [[Mogadishu]]? [[Las Anod]]? [[Garoowe|Garoe]]?" [Non-Isaaq territory].

==Economy==

[[File:Burcobout.jpeg|thumb|right|A fabric and carpet boutique in Burao's old section]]
 
The city's economy is primarily based on the export of livestock, with Burao and the nearby town of [[Yiroowe]] being home to two of the largest livestock markets, known in [[Somali language|Somali]] as ''seylado'' in the [[Horn of Africa]], with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily in the city.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Project|first1=War-torn Societies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTtyAAAAMAAJ&q=yiroowe|title=Rebuilding Somaliland: Issues and Possibilities|last2=Programme|first2=WSP Transition|date=2005|publisher=Red Sea Press|isbn=978-1-56902-228-3}}</ref> Burao's livestock market is also the most important livestock market in Somaliland as well as Somalia.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Alexandra|year=2003|title=Hargeisa Urban Household Economy Assessment|url=https://fews.net/sites/default/files/documents/reports/so_baseline_urban_Hargeisa_en.pdf|journal=FEWS Net|location=Hargeisa|publication-date=24 April 2003|pages=21|quote=The main Hargeisa livestock market is the second most important livestock market in Somaliland/Somalia after Burao}}</ref>

The city's central location serves as a hub that connects the nomadic interior of Somaliland and major cities like [[Erigavo]], [[Aynaba]] and [[Las Anod]] to Somaliland's capital [[Hargeisa]] and its main port in [[Berbera]]. The central location of Burao has contributed to its economic revival. Goods travelling to the south, central and eastern parts of Somaliland all depart from the city's outskirts. Rural merchants also sell their produce on a daily basis, which attracts business. This along with the main livestock market of the city fuels Burao's economy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2EwAQAAIAAJ&q=yiroowe|title=A Self-portrait of Somaliland: Rebuilding from the Ruins|date=1999|publisher=Somaliland Centre for Peace and Development}}</ref>

In 2007, Burao's city authority (in conjunction with development organizations and local traders) opened the Burco Meat and Produce complex. One year in the making, the market has two main halls and can accommodate more than 2000 merchants.<ref name="Anmcfbt">{{cite web|url=http://www.qarannews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=318&Itemid=62|title=Qaran News|website=www.QaranNews.com|access-date=4 June 2012}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==

Burao's landscape is semi-desert and fairly flat.

The [[Togdheer River]] runs through the town. It is often dry but subject to flooding. The river divides the city in half, and can be crossed via a newly built bridge in the city center.

Weather in Burao, much like other inland towns in Somaliland, is very warm to hot and dry year-round. The city has a [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh'') in common with most of Somalia, although Burao's weather is moderated by altitude. The average daytime temperatures during the summer months of June and August can rise to {{convert|31|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, with a low of {{convert|20|°C|°F|disp=or}} at night. The weather is cooler the rest of the year, averaging {{convert|27|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} during the day and {{convert|13|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} at nighttime. The city's limited rainfall of {{convert|222|mm|in|0|disp=or}} usually comes with two peaks during April–May and October–November.

==Wildlife==

Due to the fertility and greenery of the region, wild animals come to the area either to breed or to graze on the grassland savannah. Prominent animals found locally include the [[kudu]], [[wild boar]], [[zebra]], [[Somali wild ass]], [[warthog]], [[antelope]], the [[Somali sheep]], [[wild goat]], [[camel]], and many different types of birds. Due south of Burao is a grassland savannah, which attracts many types of fauna to the region, including lions and leopards.

==Transportation==

[[File:Burcoresid.jpeg|thumb|right|A residential area in Burao]]

Burao has a working bus system. Air transportation needs are served by the [[Burao Airport]], which offers flights via [[Daallo Airlines]] to [[Hargeisa]] and other cities in the [[Horn of Africa]], as well as international locations such as [[Addis Ababa]] and [[San'aa]]. As of 2012, the airport's facilities are undergoing major renovations, supervised by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).
