Raleigh is an early example in the United States of a [[Planned community|planned city]].<ref name="RaleighNCHP"/> Following the [[American Revolutionary War]] when the U.S. gained independence, the area was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the [[North Carolina State Capitol]] at the center, in Union Square. During the [[American Civil War]], the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period, related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and  the social unrest of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. The establishment of the [[Research Triangle Park]] (RTP) in 1959 helped create tens of thousands of jobs in the fields of science and technology. By the early 21st century, Raleigh had become one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Raleigh, North Carolina}}

===Earlier capitals===
[[Bath, North Carolina|Bath]], the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], was established in 1743.

===18th century===
In December 1770, [[Joel Lane House|Joel Lane]] successfully petitioned the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly.<ref>{{cite web |title=History Of Raleigh |url=https://raleighnc.gov/history-raleigh |access-date=2020-10-21 |website=raleighnc.gov |language=en |archive-date=October 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026083013/https://raleighnc.gov/history-raleigh |url-status=dead }}</ref> The county was formed from portions of [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland]], [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange]], and [[Johnston County, North Carolina|Johnston]] counties, and was named for [[Margaret Wake Tryon]], the wife of Governor [[William Tryon]]. The first county seat was [[Bloomsbury Historic District|Bloomsbury]].

[[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], a port town on the [[Neuse River]] {{cvt|35|mi}} from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the [[American Revolution]]. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nchistory.web.unc.edu/state-capital/ |title=Fact: The state capital of North Carolina is Fayetteville &#124; North Carolina History |publisher=Nchistory.web.unc.edu |access-date=June 1, 2014 |archive-date=July 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701200627/http://nchistory.web.unc.edu/state-capital/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]].

Raleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital.<ref>{{cite web |title=Raleigh History |url=http://www.cityofraleighmuseum.org/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214101426/http://www.cityofraleighmuseum.org/history/ |archive-date=December 14, 2019 |website=City of Raleigh Museum |access-date=April 24, 2022}}</ref> The city was incorporated on December 31, 1792, and a charter granted January 21, 1795.<ref name="RaleighNCHP">{{Cite web |last=Peters |first=Ken |title=City of Raleigh |url=https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/city-of-raleigh/ |access-date=November 6, 2022 |website=North Carolina History Project |publisher=John Locke Foundation |language=en-US}}</ref> The city was named for [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the "lost colony" on Roanoke Island.<ref>{{cite book |last=Powell |first=William |title=North Carolina Gazetteer |date=1968 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |page=402}}</ref>

No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site.

Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South.<ref name="nc architecture">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NccTgQkmPIEC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2005 |page=73 |title=North Carolina Architecture |first=Catherine |last=Bishir |isbn=978-0-8078-5624-6}}</ref> The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on [[Thomas Holme]]'s 1682 plan for [[Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whitfield |first1=Peter |title=Cities of the World: A History in Maps |date=2005 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |page=149 |isbn=9780520247253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WS4jgVqnck8C&pg=PA149}}</ref> The city was developed on the land of various [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantations]] including [[Crabtree Jones House|Crabtree]], [[Mordecai House|Mordecai]], [[Historic Oak View|Oak View]], [[Pine Hall (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Pine Hall]], [[Pullen House|Pullen]], [[Spring Hill (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Spring Hill]], and [[Joel Lane House|Wakefield]].

The [[North Carolina General Assembly]] first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a [[charter]], with a board of seven appointed [[commissioner]]s and an "[[Intendant]] of Police" (which developed as the office of [[Mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina|Mayor]]) to govern it. After 1803, city commissioners were elected. In 1799, the ''N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser'' was the first newspaper published in Raleigh.<ref name="cityhistory">{{cite web |title=City of Raleigh Years (1587–1844) |publisher=City of Raleigh |url=http://www.raleigh-nc.org/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-095008-History_of_Raleigh__1587.html |access-date=March 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117213722/http://www.raleigh-nc.org/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-095008-History_of_Raleigh__1587.html |archive-date=November 17, 2007}}</ref> [[John Haywood (politician)|John Haywood]] was the first Intendant of Police.<ref name="haywood">{{cite web |title=About John Haywood |publisher=NSCDA |url=http://haywoodhall.org/Haywood/haywood.html |access-date=September 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405225549/http://www.haywoodhall.org/Haywood/haywood.html |archive-date=April 5, 2005}}</ref>

In 1831, a fire destroyed the [[North Carolina State House]]. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried [[gneiss]] being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completion of the new [[North Carolina State Capitol|State Capitol]] and new [[Raleigh and Gaston Railroad|Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company]] in 1840.

In 1853, the first [[North Carolina State Fair|State Fair]] was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, [[Peace College]], was established in 1857. Raleigh's [[Historic Oakwood]] contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic Oakwood - Society for the Preservation of Historic Oakwood (SPHO) |url=https://www.historicoakwood.org/ |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=Historic Oakwood - Society for the Preservation of Historic Oakwood (SPHO) |language=en-US}}</ref>

North Carolina seceded from the Union during the [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|American Civil War]] on May 20, 1861. After the war began, Governor [[Zebulon Baird Vance]] ordered the construction of [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] around the city as protection from [[Union Army|Union]] troops. Near the end of the Civil War, Governor Vance arranged his evacuation to avoid capture as [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Union General William Sherman's]] [[Campaign of the Carolinas|forces approached]] the city. Before leaving, Vance met with former governors [[William Alexander Graham|Graham]] and [[David Lowry Swain|Swain]] to draft a letter of surrender for Raleigh. Their intention was to protect Raleigh from [[Scorched earth#American Civil War|the destruction inflicted on other cities]] by Union troops. Graham and Swain departed to meet the advancing Federal forces on the morning of April 12, 1865, and were to return by that evening. The evening struck, but Graham and Swain had not returned due to train delays and their temporary capture by Sherman. Governor Vance left the evening after Graham and Sherman failed to return, leaving behind a letter giving Mayor William H. Harrison the authority to surrender. On the morning of April 13, Mayor Harrison among others went to the southern Wake County area to meet General [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick]] and propose surrender. Kenneth Rayner, a long-time resident of Raleigh, delivered the proposal including a promise of no resistance. Kilpatrick agreed to accept the surrender and protect Raleigh from destruction. Kilpatrick's [[cavalry]] occupied Raleigh and removed the flagpole from the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]], replacing it with a [[Flag of the United States|United States Flag]] above the dome.

Due to the economic and social problems of the postwar period and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], with a state economy still heavily dependent on agriculture, the city grew little over the next several decades.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Reconstruction in North Carolina |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/reconstruction-north |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=NCpedia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Civil War and Reconstruction |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Carolina-state/The-Civil-War-and-Reconstruction |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

In 1867, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] clergy founded [[St. Augustine's College (Raleigh)|St. Augustine's College]] for the education of [[free negro|freedmen]]. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the United States' first school for blind and deaf Black people, to be located in Raleigh.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Governor Morehead School |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/governor-morehead-school |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=NCpedia}}</ref> In 1874, the federal government constructed the [[Federal Building (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Federal Building]] in Raleigh, the first [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] project in the Southern U.S. following the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Federal Building-- Raleigh: A Capital City: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/raleigh/fed.htm |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>

In 1880, the newspapers ''News'' and ''Observer'' combined to form ''[[The News & Observer]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Raleigh News and Observer |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/raleigh-news-and-observer |access-date=2020-10-21|website=NCpedia}}</ref> It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as [[North Carolina State University]], was founded as a [[land-grant college]] in 1887. The city's [[Rex Hospital]] opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as [[Meredith College]], opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Southern Conservatory Of Music (1898-1924) |url=https://www.opendurham.org/buildings/southern-conservatory-music-1898-1924 |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=www.opendurham.org}}</ref>

In the late nineteenth century, two Black Congressmen were elected from [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district|North Carolina's 2nd district]], the last in 1898. [[George Henry White]] sought to promote civil rights for Black citizens and to challenge efforts by White Democrats to reduce Black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and his allies were unsuccessful. Based on a White supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new [[State constitution (United States)|constitution]], with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of most Black citizens and many poor White citizens. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified Black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office—local, state or federal. The rising Black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican Party]] was no longer competitive in the state.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Constitution, State |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/government/nc-constitution-history |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=NCpedia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Primary Source: The Suffrage Amendment |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/suffrage-amendment |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=NCpedia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Struggle for Voting Rights |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/struggle-voting-rights |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=NCpedia}}</ref>

It was not until after federal [[civil rights]] legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of Black citizens in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Great Migration |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/history/cw-1900/great-migration#:~:text=Between%201900%20and%201940,%20almost,immigrants%20to%20New%20York%20State. |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=NCpedia}}</ref> No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.

In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.

In 1923, the Raleigh Fall Festival was formed. The Festival was reorganized as the [[North Carolina Debutante Ball]] in 1927.

Following immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh]] was officially established by [[Pope Pius XI]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=https://dioceseofraleigh.org/about/our-history |access-date=2020-10-21 |website=Diocese of Raleigh |language=en}}</ref> The [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] became the official seat of the diocese with [[William Joseph Hafey]] as its bishop.

The city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the [[Stock market crash#Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]] resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title=City of Raleigh Years (1889–1930) |publisher=City of Raleigh |url=http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-122719-Years__1889___1930.html |access-date=March 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722152014/http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-122719-Years__1889___1930.html |archive-date=July 22, 2009}}</ref>

During the difficult 1930s of the [[Great Depression]], government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, [[Raleigh Memorial Auditorium]] was dedicated. The [[North Carolina Symphony]], founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] constructed the area now known as [[William B. Umstead State Park]]. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham,<ref>{{cite web |title=Airport Authority |url=https://www.rdu.com/airport-authority/ |access-date=2020-10-21 |website=Raleigh-Durham International Airport |language=en-US}}</ref> with the first flight occurring in 1943.

In 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government, which is still the city's current form of government. Council members are elected from [[single-member district]]s. They hire a city manager.

The [[Dorton Arena]], a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by [[Maciej Nowicki (architect)|Matthew Nowicki]], was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dorton Arena – NCDA&CS – N.C.

In 1953, [[WNAO-TV]], channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.

With the opening of the [[Research Triangle Park]] in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web |title=City of Raleigh Years (1931–1965) |publisher=City of Raleigh |url=http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-131835-Years__1931___1965.html |access-date=March 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703010909/http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-131835-Years__1931___1965.html |archive-date=July 3, 2010}}</ref> In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% White and 23.4% Black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=May 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref>

Following the passage of the federal [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], one of the main achievements of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.

From the early-to-mid 20th century [[East Hargett Street (Raleigh, North Carolina)|East Hargett Street]] was known as Raleigh's "Black Main Street" and hosted numerous Black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Beverly |title=East Hargett Street was center of Black life and business |newspaper=The News & Observer |date=February 28, 1982 |url=https://www.newsobserver.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/past-times/article62016532.html |access-date=April 27, 2020}}</ref> Another of Raleigh's oldest Black neighborhoods, Fourth Ward, was demolished starting in 1971, with about 600 homes and 60 businesses south of downtown gone as a result of [[urban renewal]], and 1,600 people forced to move.

By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and [[urban sprawl]]. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman [[Clarence Lightner]] defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first Black mayor, and thus the first Black mayor in a major White-majority city in the South.<ref name= christensen>{{cite news |last=Christensen |first=Rob |title=When Raleigh elected a Black mayor |newspaper=The News & Observer |date=November 10, 2017 |url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/rob-christensen/article183884041.html |access-date=December 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the [[Wake County Public School System]], now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wcpss.net/ |title=Wake County Public School System |website=wcpss.net |access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>

During the 1970s and 1980s, the [[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|I-440]] beltline was constructed, in an attempt to ease traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.

The first [[Raleigh Convention Center]] (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web |title=City of Raleigh Years (1966–1990) |publisher=City of Raleigh |url=http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-140652-Years__1966___1990.html |access-date=March 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302040920/http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-140652-Years__1966___1990.html |archive-date=March 2, 2006}}</ref>

During the [[1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak]] of November 28, 1988, the city was affected by the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in [[Northeastern North Carolina]] and southeastern [[Virginia]] between 1:00&nbsp;am and 5:45&nbsp;am. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77&nbsp;million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in [[Nash County, North Carolina|Nash County]]) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at {{cvt|84|mi|km|0}} long, and {{cvt|.5|mi|km|1}} wide at times. The tornado was rated [[Fujita scale|F4]].<ref name="tornado">{{cite web |last=Gonski |first=Rod |title=Raleigh Tornado, November 28, 1988 |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] |date=November 3, 2004 |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~nwsfo/storage/cases/19881128/ |access-date=April 17, 2009}}</ref>

In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, [[First Union Capitol Center]] and [[Two Hannover Square]], along with the popular [[Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek]] in Southeast Raleigh.

In 1996, the [[Olympic Flame]] passed through Raleigh while on its way to the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. Also in 1996, [[Hurricane Fran]] struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, [[WRAL-TV]] became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.

In 1997, the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Hartford Whalers]] announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.

In 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called [[Lenovo Center]]), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball]] team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web |title=City of Raleigh Years (1991–1999) |publisher=City of Raleigh |url=http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-150347-Years__1991___1999.html |access-date=March 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302040927/http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-150347-Years__1991___1999.html |archive-date=March 2, 2006}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|149.60|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|148.54|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.07|sqmi}} (0.72%) is water.<ref name="TigerWebMapServer"/> The [[Neuse River]] flows through the northeastern corner of the city.

Raleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and [[Atlantic coastal plain]] regions meet. This area is known as the "[[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain.

The city of Raleigh is located {{cvt|24|mi}} southeast of [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Distance between Durham, NC and Raleigh, NC |url=https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-durham-nc-to-raleigh-nc |access-date=2020-10-23 |website=www.distance-cities.com}}</ref> {{cvt|63|mi}} northeast of [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Distance between Fayetteville, NC and Raleigh, NC |url=https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-fayetteville-nc-to-raleigh-nc |access-date=2020-10-23 |website=www.distance-cities.com}}</ref> {{cvt|131|mi}} northwest of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Distance between Wilmington, NC and Raleigh, NC |url=https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-wilmington-nc-to-raleigh-nc |access-date=2020-10-23 |website=www.distance-cities.com}}</ref> and {{cvt|155|mi}} southwest of [[Richmond, Virginia]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Distance between Richmond, VA and Raleigh, NC |url=https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-richmond-va-to-raleigh-nc |access-date=2020-10-23 |website=www.distance-cities.com}}</ref> and {{cvt|165|mi}} northeast of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Distance between Charlotte, NC and Raleigh, NC |url=https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-charlotte-nc-to-raleigh-nc |access-date=2020-10-23 |website=www.distance-cities.com}}</ref> A small portion of Raleigh is located in [[Durham County, North Carolina]].

Raleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a [[ZIP code]] that begins with the digits 276. [[PNC Plaza (Raleigh)|PNC Plaza]], formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of {{cvt|538|ft}}, with a floor count of 34.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://downtownraleigh.org/space-available/301-fayetteville-street |title=PNC Plaza |website=DowntownRaleigh.org |access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2022/10/11/as-crime-decreases-in-durham-it-climbs-in-raleigh|title=Who will pass PNC Plaza as Raleigh's tallest tower?|last=Howsam|first=Melissa|date=September 29, 2021|website=Raleigh Magazine|access-date=November 26, 2022}}</ref>

====Inside the Beltline====
[[File:Warehouse raleigh.jpg|thumb|Warehouses on Martin Street]]
One common division of Raleigh is to differentiate the central part of the city, which lies inside of the [[circumferential highway]] known as the Raleigh Beltline ([[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|I-440]] and [[Interstate 40 (North Carolina)|I-40]]) from areas outside of the Beltline. The area inside of the beltline includes the entirety of the central business district known as Downtown Raleigh, as well as several more residential areas surrounding it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oakcityproperties.com/the-pros-and-cons-to-living-inside-the-raleigh-beltline-itb/|title=The Pros & Cons of Living inside Raleigh's Beltline|website=Oak City Properties|date=March 5, 2019 |access-date=November 26, 2022}}</ref>

The downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the [[Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel]] built in the early 20th century, the restored [[City Market (Raleigh, North Carolina)|City Market]], the [[Fayetteville Street (Raleigh)|Fayetteville Street]] downtown business district (which includes the [[PNC Plaza (Raleigh)|PNC Plaza]] and [[Wells Fargo Capitol Center]] buildings), as well as the [[North Carolina Museum of History]], [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]], [[North Carolina State Capitol]], [[William Peace University]], the [[City of Raleigh Museum]], [[Raleigh Convention Center]], [[Shaw University]], [[Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law|Campbell University School of Law]], and [[St. Augustine's College (North Carolina)|St. Augustine's College]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://downtownraleigh.org/districts/fayetteville-street |title=Fayetteville Street |website=downtownraleigh.org |access-date=November 3, 2021}}</ref> In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: [[Fayetteville Street]], [[Moore Square Historic District|Moore Square]], [[Glenwood South]], [[Warehouse District (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Warehouse]], and [[Capitol Area Historic District|Capital District]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitraleigh.com/plan-a-trip/cities-and-towns/raleigh/downtown-raleigh/moore-square/ |title=Moore Square |website=visitRaleigh.com |access-date=November 3, 2021}}</ref> The nearby North Blount Street Historic District includes many of the city's historic [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Queen Anne architecture|Queen Anne]], and [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] mansions, including [[Norris-Heartt House]], [[Andrews-Duncan House]], [[Heck-Andrews House]], [[Capehart House]], and the [[Garland Scott and Toler Moore Tucker House]] (the latter was later moved from its original location to Oakwood).

Some of the names have become commonplace among locals, such as the Warehouse District, Fayetteville Street, and [[Glenwood South]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitraleigh.com/things-to-do/museums/museum-guide/cam-raleigh/ |title=Glenwood South |website=visitraleigh.com |access-date=October 8, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://downtownraleigh.org/districts/capital-district |title=Capital District |website=downtownraleigh.org |access-date=November 3, 2021}}</ref> Other neighborhoods lying inside the Beltline include [[Cameron Park Historic District|Forest Park]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=William.Hartye@raleighnc.gov |title=Raleigh Neighborhood Registry |url=https://raleighnc.gov/community/raleigh-neighborhood-registry |access-date=2023-04-13 |website=raleighnc.gov |language=en}}</ref> [[Boylan Heights (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Boylan Heights]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boylanheights.org/ |title=Historic Boylan Heights Neighborhood Main Page |publisher=Boylanheights.org |access-date=January 4, 2012}}</ref> Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, [[Glenwood-Brooklyn Historic District|Glenwood-Brooklyn]], [[Hayes Barton Historic District]], [[Moore Square Historic District|Moore Square]], [[Mordecai Place Historic District|Mordecai]] (home to the historic [[Mordecai House]]), Rochester Heights, [[East Raleigh–South Park Historic District|South Park]], Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and [[Historic Oakwood]]. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II, and roughly correspond to the extent of the city of Raleigh before the population boom of the latter half of the 20th century led to growth of the city limits beyond the historic urban core.

====Midtown Raleigh====
[[File:North Hills in Raleigh.jpg|alt=|thumb|The towers at North Hills in Midtown Raleigh]]
Midtown Raleigh is a [[neologism|relatively new term]] used to describe the residential and commercial area lying on the northside of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Six Forks Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as [[North Hills (Raleigh)|North Hills]] and [[Crabtree Valley Mall]]. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitraleigh.com/plan-a-trip/cities-and-towns/raleigh/midtown-raleigh/ |title=Midtown Raleigh |website=VisitRaleigh.com |access-date=June 7, 2018}}</ref> The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. ''The'' ''News & Observer'' newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only.<ref>{{cite news |title=Who birthed Midtown |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2009/09/30/117476/who-birthed-midtown.html#storylink |author=Matthew Eisley |newspaper=[[The News & Observer]] |access-date=November 12, 2011 |date=September 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105113548/http://www.newsobserver.com/2009/09/30/117476/who-birthed-midtown.html#storylink |archive-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref> The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011, as a way for community leaders to promote the area.<ref>{{cite news |title=Slideshow: Midtown Raleigh Alliance |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2011/07/25/slideshow-midtown-ralleigh-alliance.html#storylink |author=Dathan Kazsuk |newspaper=[[Triangle Business Journal]] |access-date=April 12, 2013 |date=July 25, 2011}}</ref> The center of the area, especially around the North Hills development at the junction of Six Forks Road and the Beltline, is experiencing rapid urbanization as several high-rise buildings have been built since 2010.

====East Raleigh====
East Raleigh is situated roughly from [[Capital Boulevard]] and the eastern side of [[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|I-440]] beltline to the Neuse River, and extending as far south as Poole Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|U.S. 1]] (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, [[Madonna Acres Historic District (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Madonna Acres]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rhdc.org/madonna-acres-historic-district-2 |title=Madonna Acres Historic District |website=rhdc.org |access-date=November 3, 2021}}</ref> New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove.

====North Raleigh====
North Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built [[subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, [[North Ridge Country Club|North Ridge]], Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, The Sanctuary, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley.

====South Raleigh====
South Raleigh is located along [[U.S. Route 401 (North Carolina)|U.S. 401]] south toward [[Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina|Fuquay-Varina]] and along [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|US 70]] into suburban [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]]. This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the [[Swift Creek Township, Wake County, North Carolina|Swift Creek]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], to the east by [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]], to the southwest by [[Holly Springs, North Carolina|Holly Springs]] and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke and Enchanted Oaks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitraleigh.com/plan-a-trip/cities-and-towns/raleigh/south-raleigh/ |title=South Raleigh |website=VisitRaleigh.com |access-date=June 7, 2018}}</ref>

====Southeast Raleigh====
Southeast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]] on the southwest, and rural [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Abbington Ridge, Pearl Ridge, Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village, Worthdale and Biltmore Hills. [[Coastal Credit Union Music Park]] (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road. [[Shaw University]] is located in this part of the city. Starting in 2020, large tracts of formerly unoccupied land along Rock Quarry Road between New Hope Road and Barwell Road, and between Barwell Road and Battle Bridge Road, have been cleared for new developments.

===Climate===
[[File:Ducks in Fall.jpg|thumb|Ducks swimming at Durant Nature Preserve in the Fall]]Like much of the Southeastern United States, Raleigh has a four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''). Winters are generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of {{cvt|41.9|°F|1}}<!--(maximum+minimum)/2, NOT the maximum-->.<ref name="NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)" /> On average, there are 69&nbsp;nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7&nbsp;days that fail to rise above freezing.<ref name="NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)" /> Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of {{cvt|46.07|in|cm|1}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/raleigh/north-carolina/united-states/usnc0558 |title=Climate – Raleigh – North Carolina |date=November 10, 2018 |website=U.S. Climate Data |access-date=November 10, 2018}}</ref> Annual and monthly temperature and precipitation data are in chart below, based on 1991–2020 climate data. February is the driest month, with an average of {{cvt|2.78|in|1}} of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms, and the threat of tropical weather systems (primarily from August to early October) bringing heavy rainfall. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of {{cvt|80.5|°F|1}}<!--(maximum+minimum)/2, NOT the maximum-->.<ref name="NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)" /> There are 48&nbsp;days per year with highs at or above {{cvt|90|°F|0}}.<ref name="NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)" /> Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two-day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably [[Hurricane Floyd]] on September 15–16. Raleigh's all-time record high temperature is  {{cvt|106|°F|0}} on July 5, 2024,<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 July 2024 |title=BREAKING: All-time record high/daily record high set at Raleigh & the daily record high set at Fayetteville.

[[File:Raleigh snow.jpg|thumb|Light snow in downtown Raleigh along [[Hillsborough Street]], 2015]]
Raleigh receives an average of {{cvt|5.2|in|cm|1}} of snow in winter. [[Freezing rain]] and [[Ice pellets|sleet]] also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging [[ice storm]]. On January 24–25, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm{{spaced ndash}}{{cvt|20.3|in|cm|0}}{{spaced ndash}}the [[January 25, 2000 Winter Storm|Winter Storm of January 2000]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abc11.com/snow-snowstorm-worst-in-north-carolina-history/5870402/ |title=20 inches of snow in Raleigh: A look back at the big snow of January 2000 |date=January 26, 2021 |website=ABC11.com |access-date=January 26, 2021}}</ref> Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of [[cold air damming]] that affects the city due to its proximity to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.

The region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience [[hurricane]]s. In 1996, [[Hurricane Fran]] caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abc11.com/hurricane-fran-dorian-nc-north-carolina/5519835/ |title=23 years ago, Hurricane Fran made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina |date=September 6, 2019 |website=ABC11.com |access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref> Hurricanes [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Dennis]] and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was [[Hurricane Florence]] in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the [[1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak|November 28, 1988, tornado]] which occurred in the early morning hours and rated F4 on the [[Fujita scale]] and affected northwestern portions of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wral.com/remembering-raleigh-saturday-marks-anniversary-of-historic-deadly-1988-tornado/19405711/ |title=Remembering Raleigh: Saturday marks anniversary of historic, deadly 1988 Tornado |last=Leah |first=Heather |date=November 28, 2020 |website=WRAL.com |access-date=November 28, 2020}}</ref> There also was the [[Tornado outbreak of April 14–16, 2011|April 16, 2011, EF3 tornado]], which affected portions of downtown and northeast Raleigh and the suburb of Holly Springs.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/04/15/north-carolina-tornado-outbreak-2011/?outputType=amp |title=Ten years ago, a swarm of tornadoes devastated North Carolina |last=Cappuci |first=Matthew |date=April 15, 2021 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref>{{Weather box

====Public transit====
[[File:GoTriangle2706 800Short.jpg|thumb|[[GoTriangle]] bus]]
Public transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by [[GoRaleigh]] (formerly Capital Area Transit),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raleighnc.gov/transit |title=The Official City of Raleigh Portal – Capital Area Transit |publisher=Raleighnc.gov |date=January 1, 1970 |access-date=January 4, 2012}}</ref> which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the [[R-Line (Capital Area Transit)|R-Line]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=2009-02-16|title=Raleigh starts downtown circulator - Raleigh - News & Observer|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/wake/raleigh/story/1404670.html|access-date=2023-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216122445/http://www.newsobserver.com/news/wake/raleigh/story/1404670.html |archive-date=February 16, 2009 }}</ref> and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.

Raleigh is also served by [[GoTriangle]] (formerly Triangle Transit Authority). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]], [[Research Triangle Park]] and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive [[vanpool]] and [[carpool|rideshare]] program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.

[[North Carolina State University]] also maintains its own transit system, the [[Wolfline]], that provides [[zero-fare]] bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://transportation.ncsu.edu/wolfline/ |title=Wolfline Information |website=NCSU.edu |date=January 26, 2019 |publisher=[[North Carolina State University]] |access-date=October 8, 2021}}</ref>

Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.

From 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], and [[Research Triangle Park]], to [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] using [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] with [[light rail]] technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the [[Federal Transit Administration]] declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.

The region's two [[metropolitan planning organization]]s appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |title=Regional Transit Infrastructure Blueprint |publisher=Transitblueprint.org |date=May 21, 2008 |access-date=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106111406/http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref>

[[Greyhound Lines]] provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.

====Bicycle and pedestrian====
* The Maine-to-Florida [[U.S. Bicycle Route#1]] routes through suburban Raleigh, along with [[North Carolina Bicycle Route 2|N.C. Bicycle Route #2]], the "Mountains To Sea" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route No. 1 and NC Bike Route No. 2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. [[North Carolina Bicycle Route 5|N.C. Bicycle Route #5]] is routed nearby, connecting Apex to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600-kilometer brevet route.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/~alanj/ |title=27th ANNUAL NCBC BREVET SERIES – 2010 Brevet Series |access-date=September 19, 2010}}</ref>
