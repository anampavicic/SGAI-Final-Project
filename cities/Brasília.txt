== Etymology ==
The term Brasília comes from the Latin translation of Brazil, which was suggested as a name for the country's capital in 1821 by [[José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Qual a origem dos nomes das capitais dos países da América Latina? |url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/geral-43201538 |access-date=2024-06-28 |work=BBC News Brasil |language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Lobos, córregos e candangos inspiram nomes de cidades do DF |url=https://agenciabrasilia.df.gov.br/2016/10/16/lobos-corregos-e-candangos-inspiram-nomes-de-cidades-do-df/agenciabrasilia.df.gov.br |access-date=2024-06-28 |website=agenciabrasilia.df.gov.br |language=pt-br}}</ref>

=== Background ===
[[File:Pedra fundamental.jpg|thumb|left|The foundation stone of Brasilia, Centennial Hill, erected in 1922 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]]]]
Brazil's first capital was [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]; in 1763 [[Rio de Janeiro]] became Brazil's capital and remained so until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeastern region, and most of the country's population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=David G. |title=Brasília, Plan and Reality: A Study of Planned and Spontaneous Urban Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSMrAQAAMAAJ |publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press]] |access-date=5 April 2017 |page=26 |language=en |date=1980 |isbn=9780826309594 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170705/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nSMrAQAAMAAJ |archive-date=5 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Brasilia's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first [[Brazilian Constitution of 1891|republican constitution]], dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.

The idea of relocating Brazil's capital city was conceived in 1827 by [[José Bonifácio]], an advisor to Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]. He presented a plan to the [[Empire of Brazil#Parliament|General Assembly of Brazil]] for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I [[History of the Empire of Brazil|dissolved the Assembly]].

According to a legend, Italian saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasilia's location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.santuariodombosco.org.br/bosco.asp |title=São João Bosco |language=pt |work=Don Bosco Sanctuary website |access-date=8 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321112351/http://santuariodombosco.org.br/bosco.asp |archive-date=21 March 2013}}</ref> In Brasilia today, many references to Bosco, who founded the [[Salesian]] order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.<ref>[http://www.brazil-travel-northeast.com/brasilia-brazil.html About Brasilia Brazil] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002043901/http://www.brazil-travel-northeast.com/brasilia-brazil.html |date=2 October 2013}} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

=== Costa plan ===
[[File:Lúcio_Costa,_1970.tif|thumb|left|Urban planner [[Lúcio Costa]] was the winner of the competition for the construction project of Brasília and played a key role in the city's landmarking.]]
[[File:Brasilia - Plan.JPG|thumb|left|Plano Piloto]]
[[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was elected [[President of Brazil]] in 1955. Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected [[Lúcio Costa]]'s plan to guide the construction of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect [[Le Corbusier]], and some of [[modernism]]'s architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city.<ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality">{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=David |title=Brasilia, Plan and Reality: a study of planned and spontaneous urban development |date=1973 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=0520022033 |oclc=691903 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/brasiliaplanreal0000epst}}</ref> Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.

Brasilia's accession as the new capital and its designation for the development of an extensive interior region inspired the symbolism of the plan. Costa used a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite thesis |type=Master of City Planning, 1988 |last1=Wong |first1=Pia |title=Planning and the Unplanned Reality: Brasilia |date=October 1989 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley, Institute of Urban & Regional Development |series=IURD Working paper series|volume=499 |oclc=21925988}}</ref> often likened to a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird.<ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/> Costa's plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south). The Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities, and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building and the television and radio tower.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 {{ill|City block#Superblock|lt=superblocks|pt|superquadra|display=1}} limited to six-story buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-story buildings;<ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/> Costa's intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The [[urban design]] of the communal apartment blocks was based on [[Le Corbusier]]'s [[Ville Radieuse]] of 1935, and the superblocks on the North American [[Radburn design housing|Radburn layout]] from 1929.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Deckker |first=Thomas |title=Brasília: Life Beyond Utopia |journal=[[Architectural Design]] |volume=86 |number=3 |issn=1554-2769 |doi=10.1002/ad.2050 |pages=88–95 |date=2016 |quote=Brasília was not, in fact, planned in any meaningful way. The Brazilian architect and planner Lúcio Costa's entry for the design competition for the new city in 1956 was a series of sketches of ideal urban forms of communal apartment blocks loosely based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and 'superblocks' of single-family houses based on the North American Radburn layout (1929). He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.}}</ref> Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (''[[favela]]s'') in the urban periphery.<ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/><ref>{{cite book |page=58 |title= Rethinking the Informal City: Critical Perspectives from Latin America |series=Berghahn Series:Remapping cultural history |volume=11 |editor1=Peter William Kellett |editor2=Felipe Hernández |editor3=Lea Knudsen Allen |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1845455828}}</ref> The {{lang|pt|superquadra}} has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=el-Dahdah |editor-first1=Farès |title=Lucio Costa: Brasilia's superquadra |series=CASE |isbn=3791331574 |date=2005 |publisher=[[Prestel Verlag]] |oclc=491822493}}</ref>

One of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north–south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis;<ref name="ReferenceA"/> the [[cul-de-sac]] access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. And the reason behind the heavy emphasis on automobile traffic is the architect's desire to establish the concept of modernity in every level.

Though automobiles were invented prior to the 20th century, mass production of vehicles in the early 20th made them widely available; thus, they became a symbol of modernity. The two small axes around the Monumental axis provide loops and exits for cars to enter small roads. Some argue that his emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars.<ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/> But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.

Later, as the population of the city increased, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Due to the larger influx of vehicles, traffic lights were introduced to the Monumental Axis, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasilia was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though this growth has made Brasilia no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic management, bus routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all serve as a remedy to the dystopia, enabling the citizens to enjoy the kind of modernity that was not carefully planned.

At the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theaters, cinemas and restaurants. Costa's Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.<ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/>

One of the main features of Costa's plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This meant that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this was that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.<ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/> In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of Lúcio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as 19th century city planning, not modern 20th century in urbanism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pessôa |first=José |title=Lúcio Costa and the Question of Monumentality in his Pilot Plan for Brasilia |date=Winter 2010 |journal=Docomomo Journal |volume=43, ''Brasilia 1960-2010'' |issn=1380-3204 |url=http://www.docomomo.com/shop/node/3 |access-date=17 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117203326/http://www.docomomo.com/shop/node/3 |archive-date=17 January 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

An interesting analysis can be made of Brasilia within the context of Cold War politics and the association of Lúcio Costa's plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil's minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Denicke |first=Lars |editor-last=Hecht |editor-first=Gabrielle |encyclopedia=Entangled geographies: empire and technopolitics in the global Cold War |date=2011 |oclc=731854048 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0262515788 |pages=185–208 |title=Fifty years' progress in five: Brasilia—modernization, globalism, and the geopolitics of flight}}</ref> Furthermore, Brasilia is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasilia is explored in James Holston's book, ''[[The Modernist City]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Modernist City" An Anthropological Critique of Brasília |author=James Holston |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1989 |isbn=9780226349794 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Syc2y5QhgQgC |via=Google Books |access-date=13 September 2020 |archive-date=21 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231121160911/https://books.google.com/books?id=Syc2y5QhgQgC |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Construction ===
[[Juscelino Kubitschek]], president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasilia's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasilia was part of Juscelino's "fifty years of prosperity in five" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer [[Louis Cruls]], in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. [[Lúcio Costa]] won a contest and was the main urban planner<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20632277 |title=Niemeyer's Brasilia: Does it work as a city? |first=Robin |last=Banerji |publisher=BBC News |date=7 December 2012 |access-date=30 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930234539/https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20632277 |archive-date=30 September 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> in 1957, with 5550 people competing. [[Oscar Niemeyer]] was the chief architect of most public buildings, [[Joaquim Cardozo]] was the [[Structural engineering|structural engineer]], and [[Roberto Burle Marx]] was the [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]]. Brasilia was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.

The city sits at an elevation of {{convert|1000|m}} and more, high on the [[Brazilian Highlands]] in the country's [[Central-West Region, Brazil|center-western]] region. [[Paranoá Lake]], a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region's humidity. It has a [[marina]], and hosts wakeboarders and [[Windsurfing|windsurfers]]. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasilia used to live.<ref name=Holston>{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernistcityant00hols/page/n178 341] |via=Google Books|title=The Modernist City: An Anthropological Critique of Brasilia |url=https://archive.org/details/modernistcityant00hols |url-access=limited |author=James Holston |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1989 |isbn=0226349799}}</ref>

The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Keiner|first1=Marco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbSoDQAAQBAJ&q=the+plano+piloto+was+planned+for+about+500,000+inhabitants,&pg=PT227|title=Managing Urban Futures: Sustainability and Urban Growth in Developing Countries|last2=Koll-Schretzenmayr|first2=Martina|last3=Schmid|first3=Willy A.|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-92020-9|language=en|access-date=10 January 2021|archive-date=21 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231121160850/https://books.google.com/books?id=nbSoDQAAQBAJ&q=the+plano+piloto+was+planned+for+about+500,000+inhabitants,&pg=PT227#v=onepage&q=the%20plano%20piloto%20was%20planned%20for%20about%20500%2C000%20inhabitants%2C&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm |title=Population of Brasília |publisher=Geocities.com |date=17 January 2007 |access-date=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000524141552/http://geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm |archive-date=24 May 2000 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

From the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/facts/history.html |title=Immigration to Brasília |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |access-date=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211139/http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/facts/history.html |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the close of the 20th century, Brasilia was the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.<ref>[http://salebatterymart.over-blog.com/article-brasilia-and-asuncion-110994606.html Brasília in the World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715044630/http://salebatterymart.over-blog.com/article-brasilia-and-asuncion-110994606.html |date=15 July 2014 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref> Brasilia has one of the highest [[population growth]] rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to [[internal migration]].

Brasilia's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian [[internal migration|internal migrants]]. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city's [[Human Development Index]] was 0.936 in 2000 ([[developed country|developed]] level), and the city's [[literacy]] rate was around 95.65%.

Brasília does not have a mayor or councillors, because article 32 of the [[Constitution of Brazil]] expressly prohibits the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] being divided into [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]].

The Federal District is a [[Juridical person|legal entity of internal public law]], which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil of a ''[[sui generis]]'' nature, because it is neither a [[Federated state|state]] nor a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]], but rather a special entity that incorporates the legislative powers reserved to the states and municipalities, as provided in Article 32, § 1º of the Constitution, which gives it a hybrid nature, both state and municipal.<ref name="Constituição">{{cite web |language=pt |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/ConstituicaoCompilado.htm |title=Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil de 1988 - Título III, Capítulo V: Do Distrito Federal e dos Territórios |publisher=Governo do Brasil |date=1988 |access-date=4 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505161928/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/ConstituicaoCompilado.htm |archive-date=5 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.<ref>{{cite book |language=pt |url=http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm#prefeitos |title= A História de Brasília |contribution= Prefeitos |publisher= Info Brasília |access-date= 17 April 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100412115640/http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm#prefeitos |archive-date= 12 April 2010 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |language=pt |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/educacao/voce-sabia/por-que-brasilia-nao-tem-prefeito,7318859fd53ea310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html |title=Por que Brasília não tem prefeito? |publisher=Portal Terra |date=25 August 2010 |access-date=4 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003809/http://noticias.terra.com.br/educacao/voce-sabia/por-que-brasilia-nao-tem-prefeito,7318859fd53ea310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html |archive-date=3 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the [[Legislative Chamber of the Federal District]], whose nomenclature includes a mixture of [[legislative assembly]] (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and of [[municipal chamber]] (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.<ref>{{cite web |language=pt |url=http://www.cl.df.gov.br/sobre-a-cldf |title=Sobre a Câmara Legislativa |publisher=Câmara Legislativa do Distrito Federal |access-date=4 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090920/http://www.cl.df.gov.br/sobre-a-cldf |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Câmara Legislativa do Distrito Federal 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Legislative Chamber of the Federal District]] building]]

The judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories as it is constituted, but Brazil does not have any territories. Therefore, the [[Court of Justice of the Federal District and of the Territories]] only serves the Federal District.

Part of the budget of the Federal District Government comes from the Constitutional Fund of the Federal District. In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6&nbsp;billion reais.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.portaldatransparencia.gov.br/PortalComprasDiretasOEUnidadeGestora.asp?Ano=2012&Valor=&CodigoOS=25000&NomeOS=MINISTERIO%20DA%20FAZENDA&ValorOS=26473976606247&CodigoOrgao=73901&NomeOrgao=FUNDO%20CONSTITUCIONAL%20DO%20DISTRITO%20FEDERAL-FCDF&ValorOrgao=962927173616 |title=Portal da Transparência - Fundo Constitucional do Distrito Federal |access-date=26 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221143621/http://www.portaldatransparencia.gov.br/PortalComprasDiretasOEUnidadeGestora.asp?Ano=2012&Valor=&CodigoOS=25000&NomeOS=MINISTERIO%20DA%20FAZENDA&ValorOS=26473976606247&CodigoOrgao=73901&NomeOrgao=FUNDO%20CONSTITUCIONAL%20DO%20DISTRITO%20FEDERAL-FCDF&ValorOrgao=962927173616 |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By 2015, the forecast is 12.4&nbsp;billion reais, of which more than half (6.4&nbsp;billion) is spent on public security spending.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seplan.df.gov.br/noticias/item/2511-c%C3%A2mara-legislativa-aprova-or%C3%A7amento-para-2015.html |title=Ao todo, o GDF poderá contar com um orçamento de R$ 37,2 bilhões para o próximo ano |access-date=26 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221151436/http://www.seplan.df.gov.br/noticias/item/2511-c%C3%A2mara-legislativa-aprova-or%C3%A7amento-para-2015.html |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Brasilia aerea torredetveixomonumental.jpg|thumb|South Hotel Sector]]

The major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasilia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center.

Industries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gdf.df.gov.br/045/04501022.asp |title=GDP – Division – Federal District |publisher=Gdf.df.gov.br |access-date=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202195724/http://www.gdf.df.gov.br/045/04501022.asp |archive-date=2 December 2009 }}</ref>

Besides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://g1.globo.com/df/distrito-federal/noticia/2020/12/16/brasilia-tem-terceiro-maior-pib-entre-cidades-do-pais-diz-ibge.ghtml |title=GDP 2018 |date=16 December 2020 |access-date=19 May 2022 |archive-date=19 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220519185947/https://g1.globo.com/df/distrito-federal/noticia/2020/12/16/brasilia-tem-terceiro-maior-pib-entre-cidades-do-pais-diz-ibge.ghtml |url-status=live }}</ref> representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.

Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by [[UNESCO]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445/ |title=Brasília UNESCO |access-date=19 May 2022 |archive-date=10 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230510220137/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445/ |url-status=live }}</ref> the government in Brasilia has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.

According to [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]]'s [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees#Mercer surveys|city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees]], Brasilia ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind São Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).

===Industries===

Industries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others); food processing (Perdigão, Sadia); furniture making; [[recycling]] (Novo Rio, [[Rexam]], Latasa and others); [[pharmaceuticals]] (União Química); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are [[coffee]], [[guava]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, [[papaya]]s, [[soybean]]s, and [[mango]]es. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.

The [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], where Brasilia is located, has a GDP of R$133,4&nbsp;billion (about US$64.1&nbsp;billion), about the same as Belarus according to [[The Economist]]. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%.<ref name=GDF>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/content/compare-cabana |title=Comparing Brazilian states with countries |publisher=Economist.com |date=5 September 2011 |access-date=25 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115526/http://www.economist.com/content/compare-cabana |archive-date=10 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Federal District has the largest [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.<ref name=GDF/>

The city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including [[Hotel|accommodation]], Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of [[Lake Paranoá]].

==Culture==

[[File:Brasília_-_Museu_e_Biblioteca_nacional.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cultural Complex of the Republic]] is formed by the National Library of Brasília and the National Museum of the Republic buildings]]

As a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasilia is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 [[embassies]], a wide range of restaurants and a complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.

In June, large festivals known as "[[festa junina|festas juninas]]" are held celebrating [[List of Catholic saints|Catholic saints]] such as [[Saint Anthony of Padua]], [[Saint John the Baptist]], and [[Saint Peter]]. On 7 September, the traditional [[Brazilian Independence Day|Independence Day]] parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. [[Christmas]] is widely celebrated, and [[New Year's Eve]] usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.<ref>[http://nichecreator.com/Brasilia Brasília] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507063453/http://nichecreator.com/Brasilia |date=7 May 2014 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

The city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like [[Bruno Giorgi]], Alfredo Ceschiatti, [[Athos Bulcão]], Marianne Peretti, [[Alfredo Volpi]], [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti|Di Cavalcanti]], Dyllan Taxman, [[Victor Brecheret]] and [[Burle Marx]], whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelbite.co.uk/destinations/city-guide/guides/what-do/what-do-in-brasilia-$447179.htm |title=Culture in Brasília |publisher=Travelbite.co.uk |date=9 August 2006 |access-date=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220141939/http://www.travelbite.co.uk/destinations/city-guide/guides/what-do/what-do-in-brasilia-%24447179.htm |archive-date=20 December 2011 }}</ref>

The city is the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of bands like: [[Legião Urbana]], [[Capital Inicial]], [[Aborto Elétrico]], [[Plebe Rude]] and [[Raimundos]]. Brasilia has the Rock Basement Festival which brings new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking of the [[Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha|Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha]].

Since 1965, the annual Brasilia Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasilia still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.

The International Dance Seminar in Brasilia has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro.

Brasilia has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, ''The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy'', by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm |title=Dom Bosco – Brasília |publisher=Infobrasilia.com.br |date=21 April 1965 |access-date=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412115640/http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm |archive-date=12 April 2010 }}</ref> According to Don Bosco's prophecy:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ginasant/3383018251/ |title=Dom Bosco – Brasília |publisher=Flickr.com |date=24 March 2009 |access-date=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824041650/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ginasant/3383018251/ |archive-date=24 August 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> "Between parallels [[15th parallel south|15]] and [[20th parallel south|20]], around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land". Brasilia lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake ([[Lake Paranoá|Paranoá Lake]]) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasilia's [[patron saint]].

''[[American Flagg!]]'', the [[First Comics]] comic book series created by [[Howard Chaykin]], portrays Brasilia as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 [[Rede Globo]] series ''[[Felizes para Sempre?]]'' was set in Brasilia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/revista-da-tv/maria-fernanda-candido-enrique-diaz-gravam-com-fernando-meirelles-nova-serie-da-globo-em-brasilia-14750029|title=Maria Fernanda Cândido e Enrique Diaz gravam com Fernando Meirelles nova série da Globo, em Brasilia|author=Natália Castro|date=8 December 2014|publisher=Revista da TV|work=[[O Globo]]|access-date=22 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222005104/http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/revista-da-tv/maria-fernanda-candido-enrique-diaz-gravam-com-fernando-meirelles-nova-serie-da-globo-em-brasilia-14750029|archive-date=22 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Architecture and urbanism ===
[[File:BrasiliaBanNacional.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Brazilian Flag]] and the National Congress in spring]]

At the Square of Three Powers, Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and Brazilian structural engineer [[Joaquim Cardozo]] made buildings in the style of modern Brazilian architecture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.homestratosphere.com/oscar-niemeyer-design/ |title=Oscar Niemeyer |date=25 May 2022 |access-date=28 May 2022 |archive-date=8 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220808172617/https://www.homestratosphere.com/oscar-niemeyer-design/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.

The National Congress building is located in the middle of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]], the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]] where the [[Palácio do Planalto]] and the [[Supreme Federal Court]] are located. The Brazilian landscape architect [[Roberto Burle Marx]] designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings. In residential areas, buildings were built that were inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11688-review-of-roberto-burle-marx-brazilian-modernist |title=Roberto Burle Marx - Brazilian Modernist |access-date=28 May 2022 |archive-date=28 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220528175343/https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11688-review-of-roberto-burle-marx-brazilian-modernist |url-status=live }}</ref>

Although not fully accomplished, the "Brasilia utopia" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the ''{{lang|pt|superquadras}}'') surrounded by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.<ref name="global.britannica.com">{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/77841/Brasilia|title=Brasília - Britannica|date=21 September 2023|language=en|access-date=20 September 2014|archive-date=21 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231121160852/https://www.britannica.com/place/Brasilia|url-status=live}}</ref> Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname "ilha da fantasia" ("fantasy island"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of [[Goiás]] and [[Minas Gerais]], around Brasilia.<ref name="global.britannica.com"/>

Critics of Brasilia's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:
[[File:Brasilia aerea eixo monumental.jpg|thumb|The [[Monumental Axis]]]]
[[File:Vista_aérea_da_Asa_Sul_em_direção_ao_Lago_Sul.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of South Wing (''Asa Sul'') district]]

{{Blockquote|Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with [[Volkswagen]]s. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.|author=[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|title=''[[The Shock of the New]]''|source=Episode 4: "Trouble in Utopia", (1980)}}

====Notable structures====

The [[Cathedral of Brasília|Cathedral of Brasilia]] in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and the structural engineer [[Joaquim Cardozo]]. This concrete-framed [[hyperboloid structure]], seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.

The cathedral's structure was finished on 31 May 1970, and only the {{convert|70|m|2|abbr=on}} diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's and Cardozo's project of Cathedral of Brasilia is based in the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.

At the end of the ''[[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]]'' ("Monumental Axis") lies the ''Esplanada dos Ministérios'' ("Ministries Esplanade"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/maps/esplanada-ministerios.php|title=Esplanada dos Ministérios - map - Brasilia|website=www.aboutbrasilia.com|access-date=27 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305055530/http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/maps/esplanada-ministerios.php|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> an open area in downtown Brasilia. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.

''[[Praça dos Três Poderes]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Square of the Three Powers'') is a plaza in Brasilia. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the [[Palácio do Planalto]] (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Court]] (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasilia, designed by [[Lúcio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.

[[File:Homologação do tombamento de obras do Niemeyer (34321040524).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Palácio da Alvorada]]]]

The [[Palácio da Alvorada]] is the official residence of the [[president of Brazil]]. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasilia, by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the "Alvorada" lies on a peninsula at the shore of [[Lake Paranoá]].
[[File:Meteoro - Palácio Itamaraty.jpg|left|thumb|Itamaraty Palace facade]]
The principles of simplicity and modernity that in the past characterized the great works of architecture motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landing on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m<sup>2</sup> with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor.

The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.

The [[Palácio do Planalto]] is the official workplace of the [[president of Brazil]]. It is located at the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]] in Brasilia. As the [[Politics of Brazil|seat of government]], the term "Planalto" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto.

The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the [[Palácio da Alvorada]]. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the "Planalto", including the [[Vice-President of Brazil]] and the [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|Chief of Staff]]. The other Ministries are along the [[Monumental Axis|Esplanada dos Ministérios]]. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was [[Oscar Niemeyer]], creator of most of the important buildings in Brasilia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.

[[File:Brasilia aerea aeroporto.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the airport]]
[[Brasília International Airport|Brasilia–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport]] serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest Brazilian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.<ref name="pax"/> Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This results in a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in a holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, [[Infraero]] built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.<ref name="pax">[http://www.infraero.gov.br/upload/arquivos/movi/mov.operac.1207.pdf Airport Statistics for 2007] (PDF). {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216053929/http://www.infraero.gov.br/upload/arquivos/movi/mov.operac.1207.pdf |date=16 February 2008 }}</ref> The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasilia Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the central area of Brasilia, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasilia's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/travel/airport.html |title=Brasilia International Airport – facts |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |date=4 January 2007 |access-date=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325062139/http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/travel/airport.html |archive-date=25 March 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasilia's International Airport was won by the InfraAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.<ref>[http://export.gov/brazil/build/groups/public/@eg_br/documents/webcontent/eg_br_063331.pdf Brazilian Airport Privatization – Second Round Concessions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507044503/http://export.gov/brazil/build/groups/public/@eg_br/documents/webcontent/eg_br_063331.pdf |date=7 May 2014 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref> During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40&nbsp;million passengers a year.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304311204579506002107709102 Brazil Opens First Expansion at a Privately Operated Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314043812/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304311204579506002107709102 |date=14 March 2016 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

In 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750&nbsp;million in the project. In the same year, the number of [[parking]] spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance has a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a [[VIP room]] was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments increased the airport's capacity from approximately 15&nbsp;million passengers per year to 21&nbsp;million by 2014.<ref>[http://www.copa2014.gov.br/en/noticia/inframerica-group-will-invest-r-750-million-brasilias-airport-world-cup Inframerica Group will invest R$ 750 million in Brasilia's Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507040150/http://www.copa2014.gov.br/en/noticia/inframerica-group-will-invest-r-750-million-brasilias-airport-world-cup |date=7 May 2014 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref> [[Brasília Air Force Base|Brasília Air Force Base - ALA1]], one of their most important bases of the [[Brazilian Air Force]], is located in Brasília.

===Road transport===
[[File:Hora_mágica_no_lago_Paranoá_e_Ponte_JK_em_Brasília.jpg|thumb|The [[Juscelino Kubitschek bridge|Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge]]]]
Like most Brazilian cities, Brasilia has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.

The [[Juscelino Kubitschek bridge]], also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses [[Lake Paranoá]] in Brasilia. It is named after [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], former [[president of Brazil]]. It was designed by architect [[Alexandre Chan]] and [[structural engineer]] Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the [[Gustav Lindenthal]] Medal<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eswp.com/bridge/awards.htm |title=Bridge Awards |publisher=Eswp.com |access-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717071219/http://www.eswp.com/bridge/awards.htm |archive-date=17 July 2012 }}</ref> for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in [[Pittsburgh]] due to "...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation". It consists of three {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200&nbsp;m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8&nbsp;million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.

[[File:Rodoviária do Plano Piloto.jpg|thumb|Central Bus Station]]

The main bus hub in Brasilia is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]] and the Eixão, about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Praça dos Três Poderes|Three Powers Plaza]]. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasilia. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasilia and others connecting Brasilia to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasilia (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.

===Metro===
[[File:TUE_Série_2000_(Metrô_DF).jpg|thumb|[[Federal District Metro (Brazil)|Federal District Metro]]]]
There is no passenger rail service in Brasilia, but the [[Expresso Pequi]] rail line is planned to link Brasilia and Goiânia (see below). A 22&nbsp;km [[light rail]] line is also planned, estimated to cost between 1&nbsp;billion reais (US$258&nbsp;million) and 1.5&nbsp;billion reais with capacity to transport around 200,000 passengers per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/infrastructure/brasilia-to-start-works-for-us260mn-light-rail-this-year1/|title=Brasília to start works for US$260mn light rail this year|website=BNAmericas|date=2 April 2019|access-date=3 October 2019|archive-date=3 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003091243/https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/infrastructure/brasilia-to-start-works-for-us260mn-light-rail-this-year1/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Federal District Metro (Brazil)|Federal District Metro]] is Federal District's underground [[rapid transit|metro system]]. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of {{convert|43|km|mi|abbr=on}}, covering some of the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Federal District Metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center. The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as [[Samambaia, Federal District|Samambaia]], [[Taguatinga, Federal District|Taguatinga]] and [[Ceilândia]], as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that [[Ceilândia]] had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.df.gov.br/ |title=Companhia do Metropolitano do Distrito Federal|publisher=Metro.df.gov.br |access-date=25 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209075925/http://www.metro.df.gov.br/ |archive-date=9 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Expresso Pequi [[High-speed rail in Brazil|high-speed railway]] was planned between Brasilia and [[Goiânia]], the capital of the state of [[Goias]], but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, including Anápolis and Alexânia.<ref>{{cite web |author=Fábio Amato Do G1, em Brasília |url=http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2012/06/estudo-vai-apontar-viabilidade-de-trem-entre-brasilia-anapolis-e-goiania.html |title=G1 - Estudo vai apontar viabilidade de trem entre Brasília, Anápolis e Goiânia - notícias em Distrito Federal |publisher=G1.globo.com |date=28 June 2012 |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015213355/http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2012/06/estudo-vai-apontar-viabilidade-de-trem-entre-brasilia-anapolis-e-goiania.html |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Brasilia is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered [[air sports]], sports that may be practiced with [[hang gliding]] or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city's dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great "[[cloud street|cloud-streets]]", which is also the name for a maneuver quite appreciated by practitioners.
