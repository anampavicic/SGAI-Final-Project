It is believed that the entire tribe migrated to [[Cuba]] by the mid-1700s.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Matt |date=February 4, 2014 |title=Questions of preservation after ancient village found in downtown Miami |work=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/us/florida-indian-village/index.html?hpt=hp_c3 |access-date=February 4, 2014 |archive-date=February 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205080447/http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/us/florida-indian-village/index.html?hpt=hp_c3 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Settlement===
In 1566, admiral [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], Florida's first governor, claimed the area for [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. A Spanish [[mission (station)|mission]] was constructed one year later. Spain, and briefly [[British Empire|Britain]], ruled Florida until it ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the U.S. built [[Fort Dallas]] on the banks of the Miami River as part of their development of the [[Florida Territory]] and their attempt to suppress and remove the [[Seminole]]s. As a result, the Miami area became a site of fighting in the [[Second Seminole War]].

===Founding===
Miami is noted as the only major city in the United States founded by a woman. [[Julia Tuttle]], a local [[citrus|citrus grower]] and a wealthy [[Cleveland]] native, was the original owner of the land upon which Miami was built.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Copquin |first=Claudia Gryvatz |date=January 23, 2014 |title=What's the One Major American City Founded by a Woman? |url=https://parade.com/256292/claudiagryvatzcopquin/whats-the-one-major-american-city-founded-by-a-woman/ |access-date=June 18, 2019 |website=Parade |archive-date=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015162952/http://parade.condenast.com/256292/claudiagryvatzcopquin/whats-the-one-major-american-city-founded-by-a-woman/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In the late 19th century, the area was known as "Biscayne Bay Country", and reports described it as a promising wilderness and "one of the finest building sites in Florida".<ref>{{Cite news |date=January 10, 1893 |title=The Day in St. Augustine&nbsp;— The Hack Line to Biscayne Bay |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=March 9, 1893 |title=A Trip to Biscayne Bay |work=The Tropical Sun}}</ref> The [[Great Freeze]] of 1894–1895 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops there were the only ones in Florida that survived.

===20th century===
{{See also|Cuban migration to Miami}}
During the early 20th century, migrants from the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] and African-Americans constituted 40 percent of the city's population.<ref name="Concrete">{{Cite book |last=Connolly |first=Nathan |title=A World More Concrete: Real Estate and the Remaking of Jim Crow South Florida |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2014}}</ref>{{rp|25}}  When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans around Avenue J, what would later become NW Fifth Avenue, a gang of white men with torches marched through the neighborhood and warned the residents to move or be bombed.<ref name="Concrete" />{{rp|33}}

Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and development in infrastructure as northerners moved to the city. The legacy of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] was embedded in these developments. Miami's chief of police at the time, [[H. Leslie Quigg]], did not hide the fact that he, like many other white Miami police officers, was a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Unsurprisingly, these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law. Quigg, for example, "personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman".<ref name="Concrete" />{{rp|53}}<ref>{{Cite news |title=Miami Police chief is jailed for murder joins 5 other officers |work=The New York Times |date=March 24, 1928 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1928/03/24/archives/miami-police-chief-is-jailed-for-murder-joins-5-other-officers.html |access-date=August 23, 2021 |archive-date=August 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210823050952/https://www.nytimes.com/1928/03/24/archives/miami-police-chief-is-jailed-for-murder-joins-5-other-officers.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The collapse of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]], and the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s slowed development. When [[World War II]] began, Miami became a base for U.S. defense against [[U-boat|German submarines]] due to its prime location on the southern coast of Florida. This brought an increase in Miami's population; 172,172 people lived in the city by 1940. The city's nickname, ''The Magic City'', came from its rapid growth, which was noticed by winter visitors who remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic.<ref name="MDInfocenter" />

After [[Fidel Castro]] rose to power in [[Cuba]] following the [[Cuban Revolution|Revolution]] in 1959, many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the city's population. Miami's national profile expanded dramatically in the 1970s, particularly in 1972.<ref name="SFMN 1972">{{cite web |last1=Permuy |first1=Antonio |last2=Cosio |first2=Leo |title=Revisiting 1972: the year that made modern Miami |url=https://sfmn.fiu.edu/dolphins-democratic-convention-1972-nixon-miami/ |website=www.sfmn.fiu.edu |date=December 27, 2022 |publisher=South Florida Media Network |access-date=December 27, 2022 |archive-date=December 27, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221227181828/https://sfmn.fiu.edu/dolphins-democratic-convention-1972-nixon-miami/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The region hosted both the [[1972 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[1972 Republican National Convention|Republican National Conventions]] in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 Presidential election]].

The area's educational and cultural institutions also developed significantly in this period, positioning the city to service a larger and increasingly international population.<ref name="SFMN 1972" /> 

Miami developed new businesses and cultural amenities as part of the [[New South]] in the 1980s and 1990s. At the same time, South Florida weathered social problems related to [[War on drugs|drug wars]], immigration from [[Haiti]] and Latin America, and the widespread destruction of [[Hurricane Andrew]].<ref>{{cite web |date=October 1, 2017 |title=Zoe Pound (Miami) |url=https://unitedgangs.com/zoe-pound-miami/ |access-date=March 23, 2021 |archive-date=April 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415163031/https://unitedgangs.com/zoe-pound-miami/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="MDInfocenter">{{cite web |title=Miami-Dade County&nbsp;– Information Center |url=http://www.miamidade.gov/infocenter/about_miami-dade_history.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225012927/http://www.miamidade.gov/infocenter/about_miami-dade_history.asp |archive-date=February 25, 2008 |access-date=April 18, 2008 |publisher=[[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]}}</ref> Racial and cultural tensions sometimes sparked, but Miami developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international, financial, and cultural center.

==Geography==
Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the [[Everglades]] to the west and [[Biscayne Bay]] to the east, which extends from [[Lake Okeechobee]] southward to [[Florida Bay]]. The elevation of the area averages at around {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Miami, Florida metropolitan area as seen from STS-62 |url=http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption_direct.jsp?photoId=STS062-85-026 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201191110/http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption_direct.jsp?photoId=STS062-85-026 |archive-date=December 1, 2007 |access-date=August 19, 2007 |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]}}</ref> above sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest points are found along the [[Miami Rock Ridge]], which lies under most of the eastern Miami metro. The main portion of Miami is on the shores of Biscayne Bay, which contains several hundred natural and artificial [[barrier island]]s, the largest of which contains [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] and [[South Beach]]. The [[Gulf Stream]], a warm [[ocean current]], runs northward just {{convert|15|mi|km}} off the coast, allowing Miami's climate to stay warm and mild all year.

===Geology===
The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called [[Miami oolite]] or Miami limestone. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than {{convert|50|ft|m}} thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent [[glacial period]]s, or [[ice age]]s. Beginning some 130,000 years ago, the [[Sangamonian|Sangamonian Stage]] raised sea levels to approximately {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida [[plateau]], stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the [[Dry Tortugas]].<ref name="geology"/> 

The area behind this reef line was a large lagoon. Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of [[bryozoans]]. Starting about 100,000 years ago, the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped {{convert|300|to|350|ft|m|-1}} below the current level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4,000 years ago, leaving the [[mainland]] of South Florida just [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].<ref name="geology">{{Cite web |title=Miami Geology |url=http://www.miami-americabeach.com/about_us/Miami_Geology.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314102309/http://www.miami-americabeach.com/about_us/Miami_Geology.html |archive-date=March 14, 2017 |access-date=April 3, 2019 |website=miami-americabeach.com}}</ref>

Beneath the plain lies the [[Biscayne Aquifer]], a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] to [[Florida Bay]]. It comes closest to the surface around the cities of [[Miami Springs, Florida|Miami Springs]] and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=USGS Ground Water Atlas of the United States |url=http://capp.water.usgs.gov/gwa/ch_g/G-text4.html |access-date=February 19, 2006 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |archive-date=June 16, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616200409/http://capp.water.usgs.gov/gwa/ch_g/G-text4.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the [[Miami metropolitan area]] obtains its drinking water from the Biscayne Aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some [[Underground parking in South Florida|underground parking garages]] exist. For this reason, the [[rapid transit|mass transit]] systems in and around Miami are elevated or [[land grading|at-grade]].<ref name="geology" />

Most of the western fringes of Miami border the [[Everglades]], a tropical marshland covering most of the southern portion of Florida. [[American alligator|Alligators]] that live in the marshes have ventured into Miami communities and onto major highways.<ref name="geology" />

Miami is split roughly into north, south, west, and Downtown areas. The heart of the city is [[Greater Downtown Miami|Downtown Miami]], which is on the eastern side and includes the neighborhoods of [[Brickell]], [[Virginia Key]], [[Watson Island]], and [[PortMiami]]. Downtown Miami is Florida's largest and most influential central business district, with many major banks, courthouses, financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks, and a large residential population. [[Brickell Avenue]] has the largest concentration of international banks in the United States. Just northwest of Downtown is the [[Health District (Miami)|Health District]], which is Miami's center for hospitals, [[research institute]]s and [[biotechnology]], with hospitals such as [[Jackson Memorial Hospital]], [[Bascom Palmer Eye Institute]], and the [[University of Miami]]'s [[Miller School of Medicine]].<ref name="neighborhoods">{{Cite web |title=Neighborhoods in Miami |url=http://www.miami-americabeach.com/about_us/Neighborhoods_in_Miami.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314095512/http://www.miami-americabeach.com/about_us/Neighborhoods_in_Miami.html |archive-date=March 14, 2017 |access-date=April 1, 2019 |website=miami-americabeach.com}}</ref>

The southern side of Miami includes the neighborhoods of [[Coral Way]], [[The Roads]], and [[Coconut Grove]]. Coral Way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 between Downtown and [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets.

Miami's sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and proximity to the [[Gulf Stream]] shape its climate. Average winter high temperatures, from December to March, range from {{convert|76.4|-|80.3|F|C|abbr=}}. January is the coolest month with an average daily temperature of {{convert|68.2|F}}. Low temperatures fall below {{convert|50|F}} about 3 to 4 nights during the winter season,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} after the passage of [[cold front]]s that produce what little rainfall that falls in the winter.

There are two basic seasons in Miami, a hot and wet season from May to October, and a warm and dry season from November to April. During the hot and wet season, daily thundershowers occur in the humid unstable air masses. The wet season in Miami is defined as the period during which the average daily [[dew point]] temperature is above {{Convert|70|F}}. The rainy season typically begins on the first day that occurs, or within a few days later.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Duration of Summer Season in South Florida |url=https://www.weather.gov/mfl/summer_season |access-date=May 22, 2021 |website=NOAA National Weather Service |archive-date=May 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210522184501/https://www.weather.gov/mfl/summer_season |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Daily rainfall in Miami decreases sharply when the average daily dew point falls to {{Convert|70|F}} or below. In some years, a stalled front to the south of the Florida peninsula may cause rains to continue for a few more days. From 1956 to 1997, the date summer began ranged from April 16 to June 3, with a median date of May 21. In those same years, the date summer ended ranged from September 24 to November 1, with a median date of October 17.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Duration of Summer Season in South Florida |url=https://www.weather.gov/mfl/summer_season |access-date=May 22, 2021 |website=NOAA National Weather Service |archive-date=May 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210522184501/https://www.weather.gov/mfl/summer_season |url-status=live }}</ref> 

During summer, temperatures range from the mid-80s to low 90s °F (29–35&nbsp;°C) and are accompanied by high humidity. The heat is often relieved in the afternoon by thunderstorms or a [[sea breeze]] that develops off the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the year's {{convert|61.9|in|mm|0}} of rainfall occurs during this period. [[Dew point]]s in the warm months range from {{convert|71.9|F}} in June to {{convert|73.7|F}} in August.<ref name=NOAA/>

Miami is the largest city in [[South Florida]], the second-largest city in [[Florida]], and is the anchor of the largest metropolitan area in Florida: the [[Miami metropolitan area]], which has over 6 million residents. Despite Miami being home to less than a fourteenth (1/14) of the population of the metro area, it is an outlier compared to its neighbors, being nearly twice the size of the next-largest city in the metro: [[Hialeah]]. Miami has approximately a sixth of the population of its own county, [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], which is the state's largest.

Miami had rapid growth in the first half of the twentieth century. Its population grew from 1,681 in the [[1900 United States census|1900 census]] to 249,276 in the [[1950 United States census|1950 census]]. This made it Florida's largest city, a title it retained until the [[Jacksonville Consolidation]], when the city of Jacksonville absorbed most of [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], nearly tripling its population. Since then, Miami has retained its spot as Florida's second-largest city.

Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, Miami experienced a certain amount of stagnation in its population, with expansion slowing during the 1950s and 1960s before nearly halting in the next three decades as suburbanization occurred. Miami grew by 34.3% in the 1950s and 1960s as its population reached 334,859 at the [[1970 United States census|1970 census]]. In the next three decades, it only grew 8.2%. By the time of the [[2000 United States census|2000 census]], Miami's population stood at 362,470.

In the 2000s and 2010s, spurred by high-rise construction in Downtown Miami, Edgewater, and Brickell, Miami's population began to grow quickly once more.<ref name="DowntownGrowth1">{{cite web |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Rene |title=More people than ever live in downtown Miami &#124; AP News |url=https://apnews.com/article/6d7c12fb3ff54bbd898baf096bf92819 |website=More people than ever live in downtown Miami |publisher=AP News |access-date=March 22, 2023 |date=June 2, 2018 |archive-date=March 22, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230322191015/https://apnews.com/article/6d7c12fb3ff54bbd898baf096bf92819 |url-status=live }}</ref> An estimate by the American Community Survey found that the downtown population, from Brickell north to Midtown Miami, grew nearly 40% between 2010 and 2018.<ref name="DowntownGrowth2">{{cite web |title=Miami FL growth creates social & economic inequality &#124; Miami Herald |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article229029784.html |website=Priced out of paradise: Why locals can no longer afford to live in Miami |publisher=Miami Herald |access-date=March 22, 2023 |archive-date=July 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220718114955/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article229029784.html |url-status=live }}</ref> From 2000 to 2010, Miami's population grew by 10.2% and reached 399,457 in 2010.

The non-Hispanic Black population of the city of Miami peaked in 1990 at almost 90,000, making up nearly a quarter of the population of Miami. Since then, Miami's non-Hispanic Black population has experienced a precipitous and steady decline. In the 2020 census, it was 52,447, only 11.7% of the population. Reasons for this include high costs in areas such as [[Liberty City, Miami|Liberty City]] and [[Little Haiti]], compounded with [[gentrification]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dieujuste |first1=Kevin |title=Little Haiti and Liberty City residents raise concerns about gentrification |url=https://sfmn.fiu.edu/little-haiti-and-liberty-city-residents-raise-concerns-about-gentrification/ |website=Caplin News |publisher=FIU |access-date=March 22, 2023 |date=June 30, 2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230322191019/https://sfmn.fiu.edu/little-haiti-and-liberty-city-residents-raise-concerns-about-gentrification/ |archive-date= March 22, 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What's really driving 'climate gentrification' in Miami?

The non-Hispanic White population began to rebound in the twenty-first century, as the monolithically Hispanic areas in the Western and Central parts of Miami experienced population stagnation. This caused them to begin to be outweighed by migration into the Downtown region, from Latin America and the rest of the United States. This caused the non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the [[2000 United States census|2000 census]] to 11.9% at the time of the [[2010 United States census|2010 census]]. After this, the non-Hispanic White population grew significantly faster than Miami as a whole did during the 2010s. In the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], non-Hispanic Whites were 14.0% of the population of Miami and numbered 61,829, the highest number since the 1980s. The non-Hispanic White population of Miami surpassed the non-Hispanic Black population of Miami in the 2010s.

Miami is infamous for its [[Miami drug war|drug war in the early 1980s]] and its outrun aesthetics.<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 12, 2019 |title=8 Things you didn't know about the Miami Drug Wars |url=https://culturecrusaders.com/2019/02/12/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-miami-drug-wars/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=culturecrusaders.com |archive-date=March 27, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220327070117/https://culturecrusaders.com/2019/02/12/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-miami-drug-wars/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/03/cocaine-cowboys-billionaires-controlled-miami-netflix|title=Cocaine Cowboys: the story of the billionaires who controlled Miami|last=Simonpilali|first=Radheyan|date=August 3, 2021|website=theguardian.com|access-date=November 20, 2023|archive-date=November 20, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231120222014/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/03/cocaine-cowboys-billionaires-controlled-miami-netflix|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9252490|title=Timeline: America's War on Drugs|date=April 2, 2007|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=November 20, 2023|archive-date=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329060119/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9252490|url-status=live}}</ref> It is nicknamed the "Capital of Latin America" because of its high population of Spanish-speakers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fajardo |first=Luis |date=May 16, 2016 |title=How Miami became the capital of affluent Latin America |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36281648 |access-date=May 16, 2016 |website=[[BBC News]] |archive-date=May 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516050618/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36281648 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Alvarez |first=Lizette |date=July 19, 2014 |title=Influx of South Americans Drives Miami's Reinvention |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/us/20miami.html |access-date=July 19, 2014 |website=[[The New York Times]] |archive-date=July 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720043100/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/us/20miami.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/05/07/if-latin-america-has-a-commercial-capital-it-is-miami|title=If Latin America has a commercial capital, it is Miami|date=May 7, 2022|website=Economist.com|access-date=November 19, 2023|archive-date=November 20, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231120005929/https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/05/07/if-latin-america-has-a-commercial-capital-it-is-miami|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2018/05/01/why-miami-is-latin-americas-center-of-interconnection/|title=Why Miami is Latin America's Center of Interconnection|last=Garcia|first=Gustavo|date=May 1, 2018|website=blog.equinix.com|access-date=November 19, 2023|archive-date=November 20, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231120010311/https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2018/05/01/why-miami-is-latin-americas-center-of-interconnection/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Miami is a reflection of its diverse population, with a heavy influence from [[Latin American cuisine|Latin American]], [[Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]], [[Soul food|Soul]], and [[Jewish cuisine]]. By combining them with mainstream-[[American cuisine]], it has spawned a unique [[South Florida]] style of cooking known as [[Floribbean cuisine]]. It is widely available throughout Miami and South Florida and can be found in restaurant chains such as [[Pollo Tropical]].

Cuban immigrants in the 1960s originated the [[Cuban sandwich]] and brought [[medianoche]], [[Cuban espresso]], [[Bistec de palomilla]], and [[croquette|croquetas]], all of which have grown in popularity among all Miamians and have become symbols of the city's varied cuisine. Today, these are part of the local culture and can be found throughout the city at window cafés, particularly outside of supermarkets and restaurants.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cuban Sandwich, History of Cuban Sandwich, History of Cubano Sandwich |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/CubanSandwich.htm |website=Whatscookingamerica.net |date=May 21, 2015 |access-date=July 3, 2011 |archive-date=April 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421105240/http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/CubanSandwich.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Local Cuisine in Miami at Frommer's |url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/miami/0017024034.html |access-date=October 8, 2012 |website=Frommers.com |archive-date=October 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004143352/http://www.frommers.com/destinations/miami/0017024034.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Some of these locations, such as the [[Versailles restaurant]] in [[Little Havana]], are landmark eateries of Miami. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, and with a long history as a [[Port|seaport]], Miami is also known for its seafood, with many seafood restaurants located along the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] and in and around Biscayne Bay.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Miami Cuisine: Seafood Restaurants Guide – Miami Dining Guide |work=[[Miami New Times]] |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/restaurants/search/cuisine:Seafood/ |access-date=October 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720222320/https://www.miaminewtimes.com/restaurants/search/cuisine%3ASeafood/ |archive-date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The city is also the headquarters of restaurant chains such as [[Burger King]] and [[Benihana]].

===Dialect===
{{Main|Miami accent}}
The Miami area has a unique dialect of [[American English]], commonly called the "[[Miami accent]]", that is widely spoken. The accent developed among second- or third-generation [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]], including [[Cuban Americans]], whose first language was English. Some [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic white]], [[black people|black]] and [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|other races]] who were born and raised in the Miami area have tended to adopt it as well.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 27, 2013 |title=Miami Accents: Why Locals Embrace That Heavy "L" Or Not |url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-why-locals-embrace-heavy-l-or-not?nopop=1 |access-date=September 1, 2013 |publisher=WLRN ([[WLRN-TV]] and [[WLRN-FM]]) |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082641/http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-why-locals-embrace-heavy-l-or-not?nopop=1 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

It is based on a fairly [[General American|standard American accent]] but with some changes, very similar to dialects in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]], especially those in the [[New York City English|New York area]] and [[New Jersey English|Northern New Jersey]], including [[New York Latino English]]. Unlike [[Piedmont region of Virginia|Virginia Piedmont]], Coastal Southern American, Northeast American dialects and [[Florida Cracker]] dialect, "Miami accent" is [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic]]. It incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish, where rhythm is [[isochrony#syllable timing|syllable-timed]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 13, 2004 |title='Miami Accent' Takes Speakers By Surprise |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-06-13/news/0406130047_1_cuban-accent-spanish-sound |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820020926/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-06-13/news/0406130047_1_cuban-accent-spanish-sound |archive-date=August 20, 2012 |access-date=October 8, 2012 |website=Articles – [[Sun-Sentinel]].com}}</ref>

This is a native dialect of English, not learner English or [[interlanguage]]. It is possible to differentiate this variety from an [[interlanguage]] spoken by second-language speakers, in that the "Miami accent" does ''not'' generally display the following features: there is no [[epenthesis|addition]] of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} before initial consonant clusters with {{IPA|/s/}}, speakers do not confuse {{IPA|/dʒ/}} with {{IPA|/j/}}, (e.g., ''Yale'' with ''jail''), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as [[Alveolar approximant|alveolar approximant <nowiki>[</nowiki>{{IPA|ɹ|cat=no}}<nowiki>]</nowiki>]] instead of [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or [[alveolar trill]] [r] in Spanish.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 26, 2013 |title=Miami Accents: How 'Miamah' Turned Into A Different Sort Of Twang |url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang |access-date=September 1, 2013 |publisher=WLRN ([[WLRN-TV]] & [[WLRN-FM]]) |archive-date=August 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831034043/http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Haggin |first=Patience |date=August 27, 2013 |title=Miami Accents: Why Locals Embrace That Heavy "L" Or Not |url=https://y-dc.info/2020/09/17/miami-accents-why-locals-embrace-heavy-l-or-not/ |access-date=August 10, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Watts |first=Gabriella |date=August 26, 2013 |title=Miami Accents: How 'Miamah' Turned Into A Different Sort Of Twang |url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang |access-date=August 10, 2015 |archive-date=August 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831034043/http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Haggin |first=Patience |date=September 16, 2013 |title=English in the 305 has its own distinct Miami sound |work=[[Miami Herald]] |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/07/3609984/english-in-the-305-has-its-own.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203181803/http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/07/3609984/english-in-the-305-has-its-own.html |archive-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref>

===Expressways and roads===
[[File:Venetian Causeway South Beach.jpg|thumb|[[Venetian Causeway]] (left) and [[MacArthur Causeway]] (right) connect [[Greater Downtown Miami|Downtown]] and [[South Beach]].]]
[[File:A306, Skyline at twilight, Miami, Florida, USA, 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Florida State Road 886|State Road 886]], also known as Port Boulevard, connects [[Greater Downtown Miami|Downtown Miami]] and [[PortMiami]] over [[Biscayne Bay]].]]
Miami's road system is based along the numerical Miami grid where [[Flagler Street]] forms the east–west [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] and [[Miami Avenue]] forms the north–south [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]. The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown [[Macy's]] (formerly the [[Burdine's]] headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have "NW" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, the "NW" and "SW" quadrants are much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., [[Tamiami Trail|Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St]]), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.

With few exceptions, within this grid north–south roads are designated as Courts, Roads, Avenues or Places (often remembered by their acronym), while east–west roads are streets, Terraces, Drives or occasionally Ways. Major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals. There are 16 [[City block|blocks]] to each mile on north–south avenues, and 10 blocks to each mile on east–west streets. Major north–south avenues generally end in "7" – e.g., 17th, 27th, 37th/Douglas Aves., 57th/Red Rd., 67th/Ludlam, 87th/Galloway, etc., all the way west beyond 177th/Krome Avenue. One prominent exception is 42nd Avenue, LeJeune Road, located at the half-mile point instead. 

Major east–west streets to the south of Downtown are multiples of 16, though the beginning point of this system is at SW 8th St, one half-mile south of Flagler ("zeroth") Street. Thus, major streets are at 8th St., 24th St./Coral Way, 40th St./Bird, 56th/Miller, 72nd/ Sunset, 88th/N. Kendall, 104th (originally S. Kendall), 120th/Montgomery, 136th/Howard, 152nd/Coral Reef, 168th/Richmond, 184th/Eureka, 200th/Quail Roost, 216th/Hainlin Mill, 232nd/Silver Palm, 248th/Coconut Palm, etc., well into the 300s. Within the grid, odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side, and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side.

All streets and avenues in [[Miami-Dade County]] follow the Miami grid, with a few exceptions, most notably in [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[Hialeah]], Coconut Grove and [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]. One neighborhood, [[The Roads]], is named as such because its streets run off the Miami grid at a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads.

[[Miami-Dade County]] is served by four Interstate Highways ([[Interstate 75 (Florida)|I-75]], [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|I-195]], [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|I-395]]) and several U.S. Highways including [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]], [[U.S. Route 27 (Florida)|U.S. Route 27]], [[U.S. Route 41 (Florida)|U.S. Route 41]], and [[U.S. Route 441 (Florida)|U.S. Route 441]].

Miami has six major [[causeway]]s that span over Biscayne Bay connecting the western mainland, with the eastern barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean. The [[Rickenbacker Causeway]] is the southernmost causeway and connects Brickell to [[Virginia Key]] and [[Key Biscayne, Florida|Key Biscayne]]. The [[Venetian Causeway]] and [[MacArthur Causeway]] connect [[Greater Downtown Miami|Downtown]] with [[South Beach]]. The [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]] connects [[Midtown Miami|Midtown]] and [[Miami Beach]]. The [[Florida State Road 934|79th Street Causeway]] connects the [[Upper Eastside, Miami, Florida|Upper East Side]] with [[North Beach (Miami Beach)|North Beach]]. The northernmost causeway, the [[Broad Causeway]], is the smallest of Miami's six causeways and connects [[North Miami, Florida|North Miami]] to [[Bay Harbor Islands]] and [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]].

Miami's heavy-rail rapid transit system, [[Metrorail (Miami-Dade County)|Metrorail]], is an elevated system comprising two lines and 23 stations on a {{convert|24.4|mi|km|adj=on}}-long line. Metrorail connects the urban western suburbs of [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], [[Medley, Florida|Medley]], and inner-city Miami with suburban [[The Roads]], [[Coconut Grove]], [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[South Miami]], and urban [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] via the central business districts of [[Miami International Airport]], the [[Health District (Miami)|Health District]], and Downtown. A free, elevated [[people mover]], [[Metromover]], operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater Downtown Miami, with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and Brickell. Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.miamidade.gov/global/transportation/metrorail.page|title=Metrorail Information|website=Miamidade.gov|access-date=November 19, 2023|archive-date=December 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231206145302/https://www.miamidade.gov/global/transportation/metrorail.page|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Tri-Rail]], a commuter rail system operated by the [[South Florida Regional Transportation Authority]] (SFRTA), runs from [[Miami International Airport]] northward to [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], making eighteen stops throughout [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], [[Broward County|Broward]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]] counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tri-rail.com/|title=Tri-Rail Homepage|website=tri-rail.com|access-date=November 19, 2023|archive-date=November 20, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231120183540/https://www.tri-rail.com/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Miami Intermodal Center]] is a massive transportation hub servicing [[Metrorail (Miami-Dade County)|Metrorail]], [[Amtrak]], [[Tri-Rail]], [[Brightline]], [[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrobus|Metrobus]], [[Greyhound Lines]], [[Taxicab|taxis]], [[rental cars]], [[MIA Mover]], private automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians adjacent to Miami International Airport. Miami Intermodal Center was completed in 2010, and is serving about 150,000 commuters and travelers in the Miami area. Phase I of [[MiamiCentral]] Station was completed in 2012, and the Tri-Rail part of Phase II was completed in 2015, but the construction of the Amtrak part remains delayed.

Two new light rail systems, Baylink and the Miami Streetcar, have been proposed and are currently in the planning stage. BayLink would connect Downtown with [[South Beach]], and the Miami Streetcar would connect Downtown with [[Midtown Miami|Midtown]].

Miami is the southern terminus of [[Amtrak]]'s Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the [[Silver Meteor]] and the [[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]], both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station is located in the suburb of [[Hialeah]] near the [[Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station|Tri-Rail/Metrorail Station]] on NW 79 St and NW 38 Ave. Current construction of the Miami Central Station will move all Amtrak operations from its current out-of-the-way location to a centralized location with [[Miami Metrorail|Metrorail]], [[MIA Mover]], [[Tri-Rail]], [[Miami International Airport]], and the [[Miami Intermodal Center]] all within the same station closer to Downtown.
