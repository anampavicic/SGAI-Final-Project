'''Songea''' is the capital of [[Ruvuma Region]] in southwestern [[Tanzania]].<ref name="Songea">{{cite book| last = Ndembwike| first = John| title = Tanzania: The Land and Its People| publisher = New Africa Press| date = 2006| location = [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]]| pages = 49| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j3xRcobNKXcC&q=songea+capital+ruvuma| isbn = 0-9802534-4-6}}</ref> It is located along the [[A19 road (Tanzania)|A19 road]].<ref>{{Google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps?ll=-10.683333,35.65&q=-10.683333,35.65&hl=en&t=m&z=12|title=Songea|access-date=29 May 2023}}</ref>  The city has a population of 286,285,<ref name="pop">[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/tanzania/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of cities & urban localities in Tanzania</ref><ref name="Songea" /> and is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Songea]].  Between 1905 and 1907, the city was a centre of African resistance during the [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] in [[German East Africa]].  The city is poised to experience significant economic growth in the near future as the [[Mtwara]] Corridor opens up in a few years. It is projected to be the sixth fastest growing city on the African continent between 2020 and 2025, with a 5.74% growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-worlds-fastest-growing-cities/|publisher=virtual capitalist| access-date=2021-08-17|title=Ranked: The World's Fastest Growing Cities|date=13 August 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813174630/https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-worlds-fastest-growing-cities/|archive-date=13 August 2021}}</ref>

==History==
The city took its names after one of the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] warrior, killed in 1906 during the time of German repression of the [[Maji Maji Rebellion|Maji Maji rebellion]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=All about Songea and tourism {{!}} Nkosi Zwangendaba Hotel |url=http://www.zwangendabahotels.com/all-about-songea-and-tourism |access-date=2024-07-05 |website=www.zwangendabahotels.com}}</ref>

After the Second World War, the area was marked for rapid agricultural development linked to the ultimately disastrous [[groundnut scheme]]. A railway had been planned from the coast to Songea and actually appeared in 1950s high school geography text books. During the liberation war with Mozambique the Songea area was a restricted zone and occasionally suffered aerial attacks by Portuguese forces. Its remoteness made it vulnerable to ivory poaching, and communications  remained unreliable until 1985 when a new British funded road was opened linking it northwards to the road and rail hub of [[Makambako]].

Songea became a municipality in 2006.<ref name="Muni-Council" />

==Education==
Songea is the home to many educational institutions including;

# Matogoro Teachers Colleges
# Peramiho School of Nursing
# Kigonsera High School
# Songea Boys Secondary School
# Songea Girls Secondary School
# Peramiho Girls School
# The St. Augustine University
# The Ghetto brand College

==Administration==
Songea is coextensive with [[Songea Urban District]] and is divided into [[Administrative divisions of Tanzania#Wards|wards]]. It is managed by the Songea Municipal Council.<ref name="Muni-Council">{{Cite web|title=Songea Municipality, Ruvuma, Tanzania Municipal Profile 2010|date=2010|publisher=Songea Municipal Council|url=http://www.songeaskids.org/muniprof.pdf|access-date=2012-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901072239/http://www.songeaskids.org/muniprof.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>
