'''Ambikapur''' is a city and headquarters of [[Surguja district]] in the Indian state of [[Chhattisgarh]]. It is one of the oldest cities in the state, in east-central [[India]]. Ambikapur is also the divisional headquarters of Surguja Division which consists of the six districts of [[Surguja]], [[Koriya district|Korea]], [[Manendragarh district|Manendragarh]], [[Balrampur district, Chhattisgarh|Balrampur]], [[Surajpur district|Surajpur]] and [[Jashpur district|Jashpur]].

Ambikapur was the capital of the [[Surguja State|Princely state of Surguja]] before [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]]. The name of the city is derived from the Hindu goddess Ambika ([[Mahamaya]]) Devi, who is the central figure of worship for the Hindus in the area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://surguja.nic.in/default.htm/ |title=Surguja |access-date=28 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107010021/http://surguja.nic.in/default.htm |archive-date=7 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The area under Ambikapur Municipal Corporation is 35.360 km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brickwork Ratings withdraws issuer ratings of Ambikapur Municipal Corporation.|url=https://www.brickworkratings.com/Admin/PressRelease/Ambikapur-Municipal-Corporation-25Mar2019%20(1).pdf|access-date=9 December 2020|website=Brickwork Ratings}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Ambikapur is located at {{Coord|23|12|N|83|2|E|}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/37/Ambikapur.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Ambikapur, India|website=www.fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 623&nbsp;metres (2078&nbsp;feet). The district is spread over a forest-rich area of 22,237&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Most of the district's terrain is forested and hilly. Natural resources include [[bauxite]], forest products and [[rice|paddy]] crops. [[Mainpat]] (near Ambikapur) a well known tourist place is called Shimla of Chhattisgarh. Mainpat is on a plateau with the area surrounded by jungles. The place has beautiful hill slopes, jungles, waterfalls and is a hill station that has not been exploited. There is a Tibetan settlement that offers an excellent opportunity for inter action with them. In fact, Mainpat is also known as 'Mini Tibet' because of the settlements.

===Land===
The land is classified into six categories. About 41.67% is under agriculture, while about 5.70% remains fallow. A further 11.44% of the land could be brought under cultivation by improvements in farming techniques and reclamation of marginal areas {{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. A further 1.27% is barren and uncultivated while 33.09% is forest cover and 6.83% is covered by buildings, roads and other infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

This distribution of cultivated land reflects the patterns and intensity of early agricultural practices and the extent of the population, combined with physical factors. Areas with a high concentration of cultivated land are generally those with longer histories of settlement and agricultural use.

Ambikapur is inhabited by people from across India. Moderate weather makes it an attractive place for settlement. Unlike the capital, the district population comprises [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] populations including the Pandos and [[Korwa people|Korwas]], who still live in rural areas.

Mainpat near Ambikapur is home to a significant number of Tibetan migrants who took refuge in India after the Chinese annexation of [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] in 1959.
