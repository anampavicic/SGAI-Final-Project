==Economy==
The vast majority of the economy is based on sustenance farming, despite the fact that the agriculture is an extremely challenging endeavor giving the sporadic rainfall. A logical move therefore would be a transition to non-agricultural industries.<ref name="kenya-information-guide.com"/>

During a recent, informal survey of the businesses in the town of Ikutha in southern Kitui County, the following businesses were identified:

*Butcheries
*Food Staples (rice, corn meal)
*Mini-markets (sells things like Coca-Cola, potato chips, bread, long-shelf milk)
*Mechanics
*Pubs
*Hotels and restaurants

===Industries===
Situated in Kitui town is a cotton ginnery where cotton farmers from around the county can deliver their harvest. It is the only major industry in the region, and was set up way back in 1935. Kitui is a semi-arid region and not many crops fare well there apart from cotton, hence the ginnery plays a major role creating income for the many cotton farmers in the region.<ref>[https://gesnetworking.globalinnovationexchange.org/user/kglcotton-africacom]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref>

===Minerals===
Kitui county has large deposits of coal in Mui Basin,<ref name="visitkitui.com"/> having low energy content/[[calorific value]], meaning it produces less heat when burned. It also has [[sulphur]]. The coal could potentially supply the 1,000 MW [[Lamu Coal Power Station]], and the 960-megawatt (MW) Kitui coal plant.<ref name=EnergySiren2018-12-18>{{cite web | url=http://energysiren.co.ke/2018/12/18/kitui-coal-mining-to-displace-30000-households/ | title=Kitui coal mining to displace 30,000 households |publisher= Energy Siren |date=2018-12-18 |access-date=2019-03-19 }}</ref>
