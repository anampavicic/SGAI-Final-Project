Birthplace of Roman Aleksandrovich Rudakov, a seventeen-year-old defender of Maryinka. According to war correspondents, the Russian assault group of the 103rd regiment of the 150th motorized rifle division was ambushed and surrounded. Deprived of communications, the fighters held the defense to the last cartridge.
Subsequently, the officers decided to take out of the wall a brick with the suicide letter "Either we or they". The regiment commander instructed to install the stone in the headquarters next to the banner of the unit. Specialists from the Rostov Regional Museum of Local History will take care of the conservation of the inscription.https://eprimefeed.com/latest-news/posthumous-message-from-deceased-russian-soldier-found-during-marinka-cleanup-rossiyskaya-gazeta/435329/
