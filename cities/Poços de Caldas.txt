'''Poços de Caldas''' is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the south of [[Minas Gerais]] state, Brazil, in the microregion of the same name. Its estimated population in 2020 was 168,641 inhabitants.<ref name="IBGE2" /> The city is known for its hot springs

==History==
{{Unsourced|section|date=December 2022}}
Poços was founded in 1872. The region had been inhabited by the Cataguases Indians, who were expelled from their lands by the ''[[Bandeirantes|Bandeiras Unidas Paulistas]]'' during their quest for gold. The place was first called ''Freguesia de Nossa Senhora da Saúde das Águas de Caldas'' ("Parish of Our Lady of Health of Caldas Waters"). 

In 1874 it became a district, then, in 1875, it was elevated to the category of city. It became famous after the discovery of the [[hot spring]]s, and many important people began to visit the spa in search of cures provided by the water.

The name comes from [[Caldas da Rainha]], a spa town in central [[Portugal]].

==Geography==
{{Moresources|section|date=December 2022}}
It lies on the boundary of the state of [[São Paulo]] at 1186 meters elevation and is the main socio-economic nucleus of its region, having an area of 547&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (85&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> urban and 459&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> rural) in the municipality.

The physical area is made up for the most part of a high plateau formed by mountains, fields and valleys with an area of approximately 750&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The average elevation is 1200&nbsp;m (3937&nbsp;ft), with Cristo Redentor, the highest point, at 1686&nbsp;m (5531&nbsp;ft). The topography is highly suggestive of a [[volcanic crater]] and, given that the region's rocks are indeed [[Igneous rock|igneous]] and there are [[hot spring]]s, this gave rise to a common misconception that Poços de Caldas would be located inside the crater of a large extinct volcano. In reality, Poços de Caldas is inside a [[caldera]] that was formed by the collapse of a central portion of terrain amid elevated areas, and while the latter have volcanic origin, the process that formed the supposed "crater" had nothing to do with volcanic activity.<ref name='frayha'>{{cite web | url = http://www.pocosnarede.com/cidade/historia/curiosidades.php#vulcao | title = A Verdadeira História sobre o Vulcão (The True Story about the Volcano) | access-date =23 December 2010| language = pt}}</ref>

Poços de Caldas occupies a highly strategic geographical location, due to its proximity to São Paulo (243&nbsp;km), [[Belo Horizonte]] (460&nbsp;km) and [[Rio de Janeiro]] (470&nbsp;km), whose connections are made with good highways, and due to its integration into the routes of the hydro-mineral spas of [[Serra Negra]], [[Águas de Lindóia]], [[Socorro, São Paulo|Socorro]], [[Monte Alegre do Sul]], [[Águas da Prata]], [[Caldas, Minas Gerais|Caldas]] (Pocinhos do Rio Verde), [[Cambuquira]], [[Lambari, Minas Gerais|Lambari]], [[Caxambu]] and [[São Lourenço, Minas Gerais|São Lourenço]]. Poços de Caldas is also close to the most developed regions of the interior of the state of São Paulo, such as [[Ribeirão Preto]] (240&nbsp;km), [[Campinas]] (160&nbsp;km) and [[São José dos Campos]] (315&nbsp;km).

===Climate===
The climate is characterized by dry winters and mild summers. The winter is from April to September and has an average temperature of 15&nbsp;°C and rainfall of 315&nbsp;mm. The summer is from October to March and has an average temperature of 21&nbsp;°C with rainfall of 1,430&nbsp;mm. The annual rainfall is 1,745&nbsp;mm. The average annual temperature is 17&nbsp;°C with record low of -6&nbsp;°C and record high of 31.7&nbsp;°C.

==Economy==
{{Unsourced|section|date=December 2022}}
Known principally for its thermal baths, there are several [[resort]]s in the city. Due to its wealth in hydro-mineral resources, Poços de Caldas is also known for the quality of the [[soap]] that it produces. There are four factories in the city: Raízes, Antares, Sarandi and Terra Brasil. Poços is famous for its glass, which is known internationally.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The founders of the factories were descendants of the [[Venetian glass|artistic glassmakers]] who lived on the [[Murano|Island of Murano]], near Venice, in Italy. In the city there are four glass factories: Ca'D'oro, São Marcos, Veneza and Bonora.

The local soils are rich in minerals that yield [[thorium]] and [[zirconium]]. One rare zirconium ore, [[caldasite]], was named for the area. The city has Brazil's first [[uranium ore|uranium-ore]] concentration plant, for use in the [[Angra Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Angra dos Reis]].

Poços is also the home of one of the largest [[bauxite]] mines in the world, owned by [[Alcoa]]. Bauxite is an ore that contains at least 45% alumina, which is extracted to make [[aluminum]]. The smelting operations at Poços de Caldas have an annual capacity of 90,000 tons/year of primary aluminum. The facility is the largest aluminum-powder production facility in Latin America, and the second largest in the world.

The plant has a capacity of 14,000 tonnes/year of aluminum powder and meets the market demand for ferroalloys, refractories, pigments, metallurgy, chemicals, explosives and solid fuel for rockets. The facility began production of hydrated aluminas and hard-burned calcined aluminas in 1985.

The city gets most of its electricity from [[hydroelectric]] power plants, built and administrated with local resources ([[dimethyl ether]]), leading to independence from the state's power system.

==Tourism==
The city has parks, squares, gardens, and São Domingos mountain, which has trails for walking. The sulphurous water is the main attraction and can be consumed in several fountains and at Thermas Antônio Carlos. There is an aerial tram to get to the Statue of Christ the Redeemer (1,686&nbsp;m). 

At the top of the mountain there is a great view of the nearby mountains. The city also offers options such as a Japanese tea garden, a theme park, museums, theaters, and other cultural events, including the yearly Music in the Mountains Festival (''Festival Musica nas Montanhas'').

The city is served by [[Poços de Caldas Airport|Emb. Walther Moreira Salles Airport]].
