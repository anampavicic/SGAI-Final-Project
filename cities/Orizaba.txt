'''Orizaba''' ({{IPA|es|oɾiˈsaβa|lang|OrizabaPronunciation.ogg}},  [[Otomi language|Otomi]]: {{Lang|ote|Mbo'ñu}}) is a city and [[Municipalities of Veracruz|municipality]] in the [[List of states of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Veracruz]]. It is located 20&nbsp;km west of its sister city [[Córdoba, Veracruz|Córdoba]], and is adjacent to [[Río Blanco, Veracruz|Río Blanco]] and [[Ixtaczoquitlán]], on [[Mexican Federal Highway|Federal Highways 180 and 190]]. The city had a 2020 census population of 120,500 and is almost coextensive with its small municipality, with only a few small areas outside the city. The municipality, with an area of 27.97&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (10.799 sq mi), had a population of 123,182.<ref name="ORIZABACENSUS2020">{{cite web |url=http://ceieg.veracruz.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/06/ORIZABA_2021.pdf |title=Censo Orizaba 2020 |language=es |access-date=August 1, 2023 }}</ref> While the metropolitan area of Orizaba has a population of 462,261 as 2020.

In the town of Ixhuatlancillo north of Orizaba, and in a large mountainous area to the south (the [[Sierra de Zongolica]]), live many thousands of people who speak a variant of [[Nahuatl]] which is often called [[Orizaba Nahuatl]] ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] code nlv).

==Naming==
It is generally understood that the name ''Orizaba'' comes from a Hispanicized pronunciation of the [[Nahuatl]] name ''Āhuilizāpan'' [''a: wi li sa: pan''], which means "place of pleasing waters." Another possibility, however, is the word Harish ([[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Andalusia]], in 16th-century Spanish pronunciation), this place being the hometown of the first Spanish settlers (1521) of Orizaba. Harish or—in a simplified form—Ariz, with the addition (under the influence of the Arabic language) of the gentilic "i" and/or with the ending "aba", meaning fortification, would have become Ariziba or Arizaba, from which Orizaba would have derived. (The word Harish—in turn—is, according to some authors, linked to the capital of [[Tartessus]] and could refer to the biblical [[Tarshish]]. Its Semitic meaning could be "trading post" or "foundry site", since Tartessus was a major Phoenician center of tin commerce and bronze production.)

==Geography==
[[Image:Orizaba and Pico.jpg|thumb|250px|The Orizaba Valley<br>Looking north, Orizaba in the middle distance, the Pico de Orizaba on the horizon]]
The town lies at 1,200 m. (4000&nbsp;ft.), at the confluence of the [[Río Blanco (Veracruz)|Río Blanco]] with several tributaries, including the Río Orizaba, near the mouth of a large valley heading westward into the eastern [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. This location, at the bottom of the ascent into the mountains, is an important transition point along what has been for centuries the main trade route between [[Mexico City]] and Veracruz on the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] Coast. in 1938 the upper Río Blanco watershed was designated [[Cañón del Río Blanco National Park]].<ref name = unep>UNEP-WCMC (2021). Protected Area Profile for Cañón del Río Blanco from the World Database of Protected Areas. Accessed 9 October 2021. [https://www.protectedplanet.net/5385]</ref>

Orizaba has an unusually wet dry-winter [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Cwb''').

The climate is generally pleasant, though often cloudy and rainy, and the soil of the Orizaba valley is extraordinarily fertile. Overlooking the valley from the north is the [[Pico de Orizaba]] (Citlaltépetl), a volcano that, at 5,636 m. (18,490&nbsp;ft.), is the highest mountain in Mexico and third highest in North America.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2023}}
=== Prehistory and conquest ===
Orizaba was already an important town at the time of the Spanish conquest, and it was in Orizaba that [[La Malinche]], [[Hernán Cortés]]'s interpreter and mistress, was married to the Spanish gentleman [[Juan Jaramillo]]. A plaque at the Temple of "The Immaculate Conception" in [[Huiloapan de Cuauhtémoc|Huiloapan]] commemorates this event.

=== Colonial period ===
During the colonial period, Orizaba became an important city. On January 27, 1774, the Spanish king [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] granted town (''villa'') status to Orizaba, and on November 29, 1830 Orizaba was declared a city.

=== Independence war ===
In October 1812, [[José María Morelos]] captured the city for the insurgent army. In 1821 to the end of the war, [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was in Orizaba before and after the signing of the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] in the neighbor city.

=== Independent period ===
[[File:Palacio de Hierro en 1910.jpg|thumb|Orizaba during the [[Porfiriato]]]]
When [[Lucas Alamán]] established, in 1836, the first textile factory (''Cocolapan'') of Orizaba, the city started its economic life as an industrial city.

In 1839, the newspaper ''La Luz'' was created and Veracruz Governor Francisco Hernández y Hernández gave the name of ''Veracruz-Llave'' (remembering General [[Ignacio de la Llave]], who was born in Orizaba) to the state.

On May 8, 1874, Orizaba was declared the capital city of [[Veracruz]] by Governor Apolinar Castillo, but in 1878 the status was transferred to [[Xalapa]].

During [[Porfiriato|the rule of Porfirio Díaz]], Orizaba was declared the most educated city in the state.

In the late years of Díaz's government, there was an important workers' [[Cananea strike|strike in Cananea]]. Another important [[Río Blanco strike|strike, in Río Blanco]], took place in Orizaba and was an important prelude to the [[Mexican Revolution]].

The US transport ship [[USS Orizaba (ID-1536)]], active in both World Wars, was named after the city.

The Orizaba's area (including the municipalities of [[Ixtaczoquitlán]], [[Río Blanco, Veracruz|Río Blanco]], [[Nogales, Veracruz|Nogales]] and Cd. Mendoza) economy has grown significantly in the last years due to the safety of the area, being of great confidence for national and foreign investors who wants to establish in a safe place. Another important reason is the presence of recognised Universities like [[Universidad Veracruzana]], Instituto Tecnológico de Orizaba or Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Central de Veracruz en Córdoba.
The industry is mainly focused in the following areas: breweries, paper, cement, pharmaceutical, iron and steel sector, soft drinks and food, leather and shoemaker companies among others. Also in the last years the commercial area experiments a significant growth due to the opening of new Malls & Major Retailers.
It is one of the cheapest cities to live and invest in México, as Mercer consultory published in the "Estudio de costo de la vida nacional 2012"; this study includes 42 localities of México, and was done comparing 182 products and services.

The inquiry also disclose that Orizaba's Valley will grow 10% in 2013, due to the lack of pollution, existence of enough water and other points like price of housing.

==Main sights==
[[File:Orizaba Palacio de Hierro.JPG|thumb|The [[Art Nouveau]] ''Palacio de Hierro'']]
The old city hall ''El Palacio de Hierro'' (The Iron Palace) in the centre of the city was designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]] and built from 1891 to 1894.<ref name="LPM">{{cite book |last1=Planet |first1=Lonely |last2=Noble |first2=John |last3=Armstrong |first3=Kate |last4=Butler |first4=Stuart |last5=Hecht |first5=John |last6=Kaminski |first6=Anna |last7=Masters |first7=Tom |last8=Quintero |first8=Josephine |last9=Sainsbury |first9=Brendan |last10=Symington |first10=Andy |title=Lonely Planet Mexico |date=2016 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=9781786572981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bXMDAAAQBAJ&q=palacio+de+hierro+gustave+eiffel+orizaba&pg=PT542 |language=en}}</ref> Built with 600 tons of steel, its parts were shipped from Belgium during the ''Porfiriato'' (the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]], 1876–1911), to be assembled in Orizaba. The palace cost 100,000 pesos (gold), equivalent to about 21.3 million pesos or 1.1 million [[United States dollar|USD]] as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://0cmb.atwebpages.com/calce.html|title=Mexico Inflation Calculator|website=0cmb.atwebpages.com|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> Don [[Manuel Carrillo Tablas]]  loaned the money to the city, and had to pay the additional cost of unloading the palace from the port and having it reassembled at its present location, the Plaza de Armas. Don Manuel died on New Year's Eve, 1899 without having received any repayment from the city for his loan. He had also donated the land where the present Cathedral of Orizaba and the adjacent "El Mercado" shopping center  stand. El Palacio de Hierro served as the City Hall until the city considered that it was not large enough for the growing needs of the local government, and moved to its present location.

Orizaba has an important industrial life. There is, for example, the [[Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma]], a [[brewery]]  established in 1896 in Orizaba.
