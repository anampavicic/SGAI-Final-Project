The total area of the city was  {{convert|382.97|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==History==
[[File:AizuCastle.jpg|thumb|[[Aizuwakamatsu Castle]] after the [[Battle of Aizu]], 1868 photograph.]]
The area of present-day Aizuwakamatsu was part of ancient [[Mutsu Province]], and was settled from prehistoric times. The [[Aizu-Otsuka Kofun]] within the city borders dates from the 4th century AD, and is an [[Important Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Cultural Property]].

According to legend, in 88 BCE, [[Emperor Sujin]] sent two generals; Ohiko and Takenukawa-wake to the [[Tōhoku region]] for the purpose of establishing peace after the quashing of a rebellion in the region.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=10|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

Before the late 12th century, Aizuwakamatsu was mainly a market town and a base for regional warlords. Starting in 1192, Aizuwakamatsu became part of the regions that were controlled by the [[Kamakura shogunate]]. Soon after taking power, Yoritomo granted a [[samurai]] named Suwara Yoshitsura (from the [[Miura clan]]) all of Aizu. A descendant of Suwara, Ashina Morinori, began construction of the first castle in the city in 1384.<ref name=":0" /> During the [[Sengoku period]] the final lord of Aizu, Ashina Moritaka, died in 1583 and soon the [[Ashina clan (Japan)|Ashina clan]] lost power. After the [[Satake clan]] took control of the castle, they placed a twelve-year-old member of their clan who was renamed Ashina Morishige and proclaimed lord of Aizu. The Ashina clan regained control of Aizu for a brief time in 1589 with the help of [[Date Masamune]]. However, Masamune took over the domain for himself soon after. He surrendered in 1590 to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Toyotomi gave Aizu to one of his allies, [[Gamo Ujisato]] who then began construction in 1592 of a new castle at the site. It was during this time that the town was renamed "Wakamatsu" (young pine).<ref name=":0" />

During the [[Edo period]], Aizu was controlled briefly by [[Uesugi Kagekatsu]] in 1600 after the death of Gamo Ujisato in 1596. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] accused Uesugi of gathering troops in Aizu. Ieyasu then transferred the Uesugi to [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]].  Through inheritance, Aizu was passed to [[Hoshina Masayuki]] (a brother of the third Tokugawa shogun) in 1643. The [[Edo period]] saw the economic and cultural growth of Aizu.<ref name=":0" />

Hoshina's descendants would rule the [[Aizu Domain]] for the next 200 years, adopting the [[Matsudaira clan|Matsudaira]] name until the ninth generation [[Daimyō]], [[Matsudaira Katamori]], backed the [[bakufu]] in the [[Boshin War]]. [[Aizuwakamatsu Castle]] would fall during the [[Battle of Aizu]] and the domain forfeit. A group of 22, including loyal retainers and their families, managed to escape to California and lend the name of their home to establish the first Japanese colony in America, the ill fated [[Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony]] in 1869.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dowd |first1=Katie |title=The only samurai colony ever attempted outside of Japan was in California |url=https://www.sfgate.com/sfhistory/article/wakamatsu-farm-japanese-immigrants-california-15896619.php |access-date=31 January 2021 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=26 January 2021}}</ref>

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Wakamatsu Town was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It became Wakamatsu City in 1899. On April 1, 1937, a part of Machikita village (from [[Kitaaizu District, Fukushima|Kitaaizu District]]) was merged into the city of Wakamatsu. The remained was annexed on April 1, 1951. The name of the city was changed to Aizuwakamatsu on January 1, 1955 when Wakamatsu merged with seven villages of Kitaaizu District (Kouya, Kouzashi, Monden, Ikki, Higashiyama, Ōto and Minato). {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. A part of the town of [[Aizuhongō, Fukushima|Hongō]] (locality of Oya) (from [[Ōnuma District, Fukushima|Ōnuma District]]) was merged into Aizuwakamatsu on April 1, 1955.

Aizuwakamatsu further expanded by annexing  the village of [[Kitaaizu, Fukushima|Kitaaizu]] (from Kitaaizu District) on November 1, 2004 and the town of [[Kawahigashi, Fukushima|Kawahigashi]] (from [[Kawanuma District, Fukushima|Kawanuma District]]) on November 1, 2005. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
