'''Esbjerg''' ({{IPA|da|ˈesˌpjɛɐ̯ˀ|lang|Da-Esbjerg.ogg}}, {{IPA-all|ˈɛspʲæa̯|[[Jutlandic dialect|West Jutish dialect]]:}}) is a [[seaport]] city and seat of [[Esbjerg Municipality]] on the west coast of the [[Jutland]] peninsula in southwest Denmark. By road, it is {{convert|71|km}} west of [[Kolding]] and {{convert|164|km}} southwest of [[Aarhus]]. With an [[urban area|urban]] population of 71,505 (1 January 2024)<ref name=pop>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1.  January by urban areas, area and population density] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> it is the [[List of cities and towns in Denmark|fifth-largest city in Denmark]], and the largest in West Jutland.

Before a decision was made to establish a [[Port of Esbjerg|harbour]] (now the second largest in Denmark) at Esbjerg in 1868, the area consisted of only a few farms. Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13,000 by 1901 and 70,000 by 1970. In addition to its fishing and shipping activities, it also became an important centre for agricultural exports. Over the years, many of the city's visitors have arrived by ferry from [[Harwich]], [[Essex]], England, but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875. The harbour facilities are being expanded to answer the needs of the [[Wind power industry|wind-turbine industry]] and [[Containerization|container shipping]] traffic. Esbjerg is served by [[Esbjerg Airport]] with flights to [[Aberdeen]], Scotland and [[Stavanger]], Norway.

The town has several notable museums and entertainment venues, including [[Esbjerg Art Museum]], [[Esbjerg Museum]] and the privately owned [[Fisheries and Maritime Museum, Esbjerg|Fisheries and Maritime Museum]]. The [[Esbjerg Performing Arts Centre]] was completed in 1997 to designs by [[Jan Utzon|Jan]] and [[Jørn Utzon]]. When approached by sea, the ''[[Man Meets the Sea]]'' is one of the prominent monuments, consisting of four 9-metre-tall (27&nbsp;feet) white-coloured men, overlooking [[Sædding|Sædding Beach]]. The sculpture was designed by [[Svend Wiig Hansen]] and installed in 1995. Esbjerg hosts branches of the [[University of Southern Denmark]] and [[Aalborg University]], and is increasingly recognized for its university facilities and sporting activities. It is home to the Danish [[Association football|football]] club [[Esbjerg fB]], who play their home matches at [[Blue Water Arena]], and also has an [[ice hockey]] division called [[Esbjerg Elite Ishockey]], which plays at the [[Granly Hockey Arena]].

==History and economy==
The town itself was not established until 1868 when it was built as a replacement for the harbour in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Dansk litteraturs historie: 1870–1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jVckGVrlaIC&pg=PA14|year=2009|publisher=Gyldendal A/S|isbn=978-87-02-04184-2|page=14}}</ref> which had previously been Denmark's most important [[North Sea]] port but came under German control after the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864. At the time, Esbjerg consisted of only a few farms. Developed under royal decree from 1868 until 1874,{{sfn|Chambers|Chambers|1897|p=420}} the [[Port of Esbjerg|harbour]] was officially opened in 1874, with rail connections to [[Varde]] and to [[Fredericia]], an important hub on the east coast of [[Jutland]]. Initial planning of the town was conducted by chartered surveyor H. Wilkens in 1870 with streets laid out in the form of a rectangular grid. The [[market square]] (''Torvet'') was positioned at the centre, midway between the harbour and the railway station.<ref name="Town walk in Esbjerg">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitesbjerg.dk/sites/default/files/asp/visitesbjerg/pdf_esbjerg/diverse-pdf/esbjerg_byvandring_uk.pdf|title=Town walk in Esbjerg|publisher=Visit Esbjerg|access-date=10 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222143045/http://www.visitesbjerg.dk/sites/default/files/asp/visitesbjerg/pdf_esbjerg/diverse-pdf/esbjerg_byvandring_uk.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> From only 400 inhabitants at the beginning of the 1870s, the town and its population grew rapidly,<ref name="Nagel">{{cite book|title=Scandinavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEEYAAAAIAAJ|year=1958|publisher=Nagel}}</ref><ref name=danishnet>{{cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/esbjerg-28.html|title=Esbjerg, Denmark|publisher=Danishnet.com|access-date=25 January 2014 }}</ref> with 1529 residents mentioned in 1880, and 4,211 in 1890.{{sfn|Chambers|Chambers|1897|p=420}}

[[File:Esbjerg May 1945 (10308508233).jpg|thumb|left|225px|Esbjerg in May 1945]]

In 1893, Esbjerg became a municipality in its own right (initially known as Esbjerg Ladeplads), receiving the status and privileges of a [[market town]] in 1899 and incorporating the parish of Jerne (east of the centre) in 1945. A number of institutions and facilities were soon established, including the [[Courthouse and Jail, Esbjerg|courthouse and town hall]] (1891), the gas and waterworks (1896) and the power plant (1907).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/Esbjerg|title=Esbjerg|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=25 January 2014 |language=da}}</ref> From the beginning of the 20th century, Esbjerg prospered not only as a fishing port but became one of the country's major export centres. Established in 1895 by nine local dairies, the butter-packaging factory, Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employed some 150 workers until 1920, packing and dispatching butter for the London market. It was later extended to include egg marketing under the name Dansk Andels Ægeksport. Ultimately, it handled produce from 140 dairies spread across the whole of Jutland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coneliand.dk/Danmarks%20aeldste%20forretninger/DAEF100-199/Side%20120%20Dans%20-%20Dans.html|title=Erhvervsdrivende, deres ansatte og andre personligheder. Side 120: Dansk Andels Smøreksportforening|publisher=Danmarks ælste forretninger |access-date=5 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref> After the [[Second World War]], the town developed several agricultural industries, especially meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300. The slaughterhouse and meat packaging facility, Esbjerg Andels-Slagteri, established in 1887, became Denmark's sixth largest by 1962. It later became part of Vestjyske Slagterier in 1986, and in 2001, it was acquired by [[Danish Crown AmbA|Danish Crown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slagtermuseet.dk/esbjerg-andels-slagteri/|title=Esbjerg Andels-Slagteri|publisher=Slagtermuseet i Roskilde|access-date=5 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref><ref name=byhistorie/>

Once Denmark's principal fishing port, the Port of Esbjerg is still a driving force for the town's economy. While it has a long history of ferry services to England, the town is by no means a tourist destination. ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' remarked that "nobody comes to Esbjerg for a holiday, in fact, as with many industrial ports, most visitors rush through as quickly as possible".{{sfn|Stone|Parnell|2009|p=99}} Esbjerg is the main town for Denmark's oil and offshore activities, with companies like [[Maersk]], [[Ramboll]], Stimwell Services, [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Schlumberger]], [[COWI]] and [[Atkins (company)|Atkins]] all having offshore-related activities in the town. [[Halliburton]] has an office in Esbjerg.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office Location|url=http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/locations/locations-home.page?node-id=hgbr8q6p|publisher=Halliburton|access-date=13 January 2009|archive-date=25 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625004910/http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/locations/locations-home.page?node-id=hgbr8q6p|url-status=dead}}</ref> The port has served the Danish offshore industry since [[North Sea oil|oil and gas]] were first extracted from the [[North Sea]] in the early 1970s. More recently, it has become a centre for shipping [[offshore wind turbine]]s. In addition to handling 65 percent of all Danish wind turbines, which supply {{convert|3|GW}} of offshore wind power, components have been shipped to various British wind farms. In order to cope with enormous future increases in Danish offshore wind power, 12 companies, including [[DONG Energy]] and Bluewater Energy Services are already planning the establishment of a Green Offshore Centre in Esbjerg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/wind-energy/an-ocean-of-wind-turbines/|title=An ocean of wind turbines - Green Offshore|author=Jan Aagaard|publisher=Denmark.dk|access-date=11 February 2014|archive-date=13 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213005437/http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/wind-energy/an-ocean-of-wind-turbines/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In connection with this, in June 2013, the port was significantly expanded with the opening of the Østhavn (East Harbour), covering an area of {{convert|650000|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portesbjerg.dk/en/about-port-of-esbjerg--the-latest--the-latest--new-oesthavn-will-boost-port-of-esbjerg-growth-potential.aspx|title=New Østhavn will boost Port of Esbjerg growth potential|publisher=Port of Esbjerg|date=21 June 2013|access-date=11 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140212082553/http://www.portesbjerg.dk/en/about-port-of-esbjerg--the-latest--the-latest--new-oesthavn-will-boost-port-of-esbjerg-growth-potential.aspx|archive-date=12 February 2014}}</ref>

Historically, in addition to its success as a fishing port, Esbjerg established its position as one of the country's major export centres. Before [[World War II]], there was a large butter factory, Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employing some 150 workers while after the war the town developed agricultural industries, especially for meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300.<ref name=byhistorie/> Latterly owned by [[Danish Crown AmbA|Danish Crown]] and employing 500, the plant closed in May 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/danish-crown-closing-in-esbjerg.1585.html|title=Danish Crown closing in Esbjerg|newspaper=Copenhagen Post|date=11 May 2012|access-date=29 May 2014 }}</ref>

More recently, Esbjerg has grown into an important centre for education with campuses belonging to the [[University of Southern Denmark]] (1998) and [[Aalborg University]] (1995).<ref name=danishnet/> The town holds an annual music festival spanning two weekends (nine days) in mid-August. It is focused around the central Torvet Square which hosts the main stage. The music includes everything from church concerts to opera and pop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esbjergfestuge.dk/|title=Esbjerg Festuge 2014|publisher=Esbjerg Festuge|access-date=29 May 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Sædding Strandvej 2013.jpg|thumb|left|300px|View of Esbjerg in the distance]]

The town is situated on the southwestern coast of Denmark, and is a port on the [[North Sea]]. By road, it is {{convert|71|km}} west of [[Kolding]], {{convert|164|km}} southwest of [[Aarhus]], {{convert|298|km}} west of [[Copenhagen]] and {{convert|274|km}} southwest of [[Aalborg]].<ref name="GM">{{Google maps | url =https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=55.483333,8.45&q=loc:55.483333,8.45&hl=en&t=h&z=12| access-date =29 January 2014}}</ref> By sea, it is situated roughly {{convert|380|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} northeast of Harwich, England. As a result of planned development, the older sections of the town look like a chessboard with long, wide streets with rectangular corners.<ref name=danishnet/>

The high ground of Esbjerg stretches along the east coast of the [[Wadden Sea]] (now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]])<ref>{{cite web |title= Wadden Sea World Heritage Site |url= http://www.waddensea-worldheritage.org/ |publisher= Waddensea World Heritage |access-date= 29 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1160 |title= Six new sites inscribed on World Heritage List |publisher= UNESCO |access-date= 23 June 2014}}</ref> between the rivers of [[Varde River|Varde]] and [[Sneum River|Sneum]], encompassing the coastal area of [[Ho Bugt]] and the seaside district of [[Hjerting]] to the north. Opposite Esbjerg, across [[Fanø Bay]], is the island of [[Fanø]], {{convert|16|by|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, with [[Nordby, Fanø|Nordby]] as its principal settlement, connected to Esbjerg by ferry. To the west of Esbjerg, the town boundary is defined by a number of small streams. The highest point is some {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=jernbanen/> The town is located on top of steep slopes leading down to the flatlands of the harbour area. The built-up area itself is not very hilly but there are considerable differences in terrain. Apart from the cliff in the town park overlooking the harbour, the valley of Fourfelt Bæk, {{convert|1.2|km}} in length, is the main feature of the landscape, resulting in differences of up to {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} with the surroundings.<ref name=jernbanen>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturstyrelsen.dk/en/vadehavet-kulturarvsatlas/kulturmiljoeer/jernbanen-og-exnersgade-i-esbjerg/|title=Jernbanen og Exnersgade i Esbjerg|publisher=Kultirstyrelsen|access-date=5 February 2014|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222163803/http://www.kulturstyrelsen.dk/en/vadehavet-kulturarvsatlas/kulturmiljoeer/jernbanen-og-exnersgade-i-esbjerg/|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Climate===
Esbjerg experiences an [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]; Do in the [[Trewartha climate classification]]) due to its geographical location, being next to the [[North Sea]]. Due to the presence of the sea's temperate marine currents, the city sees warm summers and rather mild winters, moderating the weather in all seasons to be mild. Unlike Denmark's eastern portion (which consists of islands), the city hardly sees any continental influences to its weather.

==Demographics and administration==
As of 1 January 2019, Esbjerg has a population of 72,168,<ref>[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&PLanguage=1 "BEF44: Population 1st January, by urban areas"] database from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> making it the fifth-largest city in Denmark, and the largest in west Jutland. Until the harbour was developed in the 1860s, the area was sparsely inhabited with just a few farms. Thereafter, it grew rapidly: by 1880, there were some 1,500 inhabitants, rising to some 13,000 by 1901 when it was already larger than neighbouring [[Varde]] and [[Ribe]]. By the end of the 1950s, with almost 60,000 inhabitants, it had become Denmark's fifth-largest city. By 1970, Esbjerg had seen a fivefold increase in population since 1901, reaching some 70,000.

The old [[Courthouse and Jail, Esbjerg|Courthouse]] on the main square was designed by [[Hans Christian Amberg]] and completed in 1892 when the town had only 4,000 inhabitants. The red-brick building with [[stepped gable]]s, round-arched windows and a tower reaching 30&nbsp;m (98&nbsp;ft) in height resembles a medieval castle.

===Churches===
The first church to be built in Esbjerg was the red-brick [[Church of Our Saviour, Esbjerg|Church of Our Saviour]] designed by Axel Møller, which was completed in 1887. In 1896, it was expanded with transepts and galleries on either side of the nave, doubling the seating capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vorfrelserkirke.dk/Kirkens_historie-5482.htm|title=Kirkens historie|publisher=Vor Frelsers Kirke|access-date=2 February 2014|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225134204/http://www.vorfrelserkirke.dk/Kirkens_historie-5482.htm|archive-date=25 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Several more churches were established after the Second World War when there was a marked increase in the city's population. The first of these, the yellow-brick [[Trinity Church, Esbjerg|Trinity Church]] with its large triangular [[stained-glass windows]], was designed to accommodate a large congregation while offering additional facilities for both young and old. Breaking with tradition, its square-shaped nave was built directly adjacent to lower ancillary buildings including a hall with a stage, meeting rooms and a kitchen. The bell tower stands alone, quite separate from the church.<ref name=natmus>{{cite web|url=http://webshop-arkiv.esbjergkommune.dk/Default.aspx?ID=21&ProductID=PROD229&PID=65|title=Ikke kun om søndagen - Treenighedskirken Esbjerg 1961–2011|publisher=Esbjerg Kommune|access-date=13 February 2014|language=da|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222180029/http://webshop-arkiv.esbjergkommune.dk/Default.aspx?ID=21&ProductID=PROD229&PID=65|url-status=dead}}</ref> 
[[File:Sankt Nikolaj Kirke Esbjerg.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St Nikolai Church by [[Johan Otto von Spreckelsen]]]]
[[St Nikolaj Church, Esbjerg|St Nikolaj]] is a Roman Catholic church, built in 1969. Unusual for a church, it is built of aerated concrete. Its innovative square-shaped design by [[Johan Otto von Spreckelsen]] served as a basis for his [[Grande Arche]] in Paris. {{sfn|Sommer|2009|p=448}} The dimensions of the inner cube of St Nikolaj Church are very close to those of the "holy of holies" in [[Solomon's Temple]] as described in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 40:5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanktnikolaj.dk/index.php?id=15|title 	=Skt.

The modern red-brick [[Grundtvig's Church, Esbjerg|Grundtvig's Church]], southeast of the town centre, was designed by Ole Nielsen. With its strangely shaped, red-tiled roof, it was completed in 1969. Inside, the large wall surfaces are broken only by 12 narrow windows on the east side, creating a contrast with the much brighter tower room which opens into the chancel with light entering from a window high on the east side of the tower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historiskatlas.dk/Grundtvigskirken_%282562%29|title=Grundtvigskirken|publisher=Historisk Atlas|access-date=15 February 2014 |language=da}}</ref>
