Malolos is the historical site of the constitutional convention of 1898 that led to the establishment of the [[First Philippine Republic]], led by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. Malolos was the site of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] of 1898, known as the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Convention]], that led to the establishment of the [[First Philippine Republic]], at the sanctuary of the [[Barasoain Church]]. The convent of the [[Malolos Cathedral]] served as the presidential palace at that time. 

Malolos gave birth to the [[First Philippine Republic]], sometimes characterized as the first proper constitutional republic in Asia,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nhcp.gov.ph/the-first-philippine-republic/|title=The First Philippine Republic|date=September 7, 2012|publisher=Philippine Government|access-date=August 18, 2021|archive-date=October 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211007035227/https://nhcp.gov.ph/the-first-philippine-republic/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.mantlemagazine.com/index.php/2019/06/12/creating-philippines-independence-hard-work/|title=Asia's First Republic|date=June 12, 2019|magazine=Mantle|access-date=January 18, 2022|archive-date=January 18, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118135955/https://www.mantlemagazine.com/index.php/2019/06/12/creating-philippines-independence-hard-work/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Saulo |first=A.

On April 5, 1572, Legazpi merges the encomiendas of Malolos and Calumpit into a single entity to form a new town of Calumpit with Juan Moron and Herrera as co-encomenderos.

On April 15, 1572, Legazpi entrusted 6 villages along Atlag River and given it to Don Jeronimo Tirado.<ref>Historia General Archivo de Sevilla</ref>

Nine years later, Malolos was officially established as a town and included it in Bulacan and dismembered on Alcaldia de Calumpit on June 11, 1580, and accepted as priory with Fray Matheo de Mendoza as its first minister in an Augustinian Council held in Tondo Convent but the civil administration still belongs to its encomendero at that time, Don Jeronimo Tirado.

The [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] constituted the majority of the Malolos populace although it is said that the town had a [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] origin; the name Malolos is a Spanish pronunciation of Kapampangan word ''maluslús.''<ref>[https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2009/05/14/467087/crossing-river-their-itlog-turns-ebun/amp/ Crossing a river, their 'itlog' turns to 'ebun'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231101104953/https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2009/05/14/467087/crossing-river-their-itlog-turns-ebun/amp/ |date=November 1, 2023 }} on Philstar.com</ref>  They were led by prominent families, among them are descendants of the royal clans of Gatbontons, Gatmaitan, Gatsalian (Gatchalian), Dimagiba, Lakandola, Ladia and Lacancale and in the 17th-19th centuries, [[Chinese Filipino]] families through [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and [[Binondo]], such as Chichioco, Cojuangco, Chiong, Chico, Cunanan, Tantocos, Tanchangco, Tanjosoy, Tengco, Tenjeco, Tiongson, Lomotan, Manahan, joined by [[Spanish Filipino]] families of Adriano, Bautista, Jacinto, Reyes, Santos, Rustia, de Leon, Agustin, Vasquez, Valenzuela, Crisostomo and Estrella.

[[Chinese Filipino]] traders settled in Malolos starting in 1670 for economic opportunity. The settlers increased, and Malolos began engaging with textile, rice production. However, the Chinese are expelled from the town on June 30, 1755, due to political and social issues.

On August 31, 1859, Malolos was divided into three independent towns; "Malolos", "Barasoain, and "Santa Isabel". These new towns are former districts of Malolos, with own respective Presidente Municipal and Parish priests. With the beginning of American rule in 1903, these towns were again reunited into a single municipality. The two other districts became barangays under the political jurisdiction of Malolos.

A major factor in the progress of Malolos was the opening of the [[Philippine National Railways|Manila&ndash;Dagupan railways]] in April 1892.

Malolos was first organized into a formal municipal unit in 1822 when the first "alcalde constitucional" or municipal head was appointed. He was Jorge de Victoria, a Filipino, who like all succeeding "alcaldes", served for one year. He was followed by thirty-one other "alcaldes", with Juan Dimagiba as the thirty-first. In 1859, Malolos was subdivided into three administrative districts; Malolos, Barasoain and Santa Isabel. Juan Dimagiba became the first "alcalde" of the down-scaled Malolos. There were 12 others who served as "alcaldes" from 1859 to 1879, the first one being Mariano C. Cristobal and the second being Capitan Tomas Tanchanco, whose term marked the start of civil turmoil in the town.<ref>''Malolos Historical Digest'', June 2000</ref>

Malolos is the historical site of the constitutional convention of 1898 that led to the establishment of the [[First Philippine Republic]], the first republic in Asia, led by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. Malolos served as the capital of the short-lived republic from 1898 to 1899. In 1899, after the Malolos Constitution was ratified, the Universidad Scientifico Literaria de Filipinas was established in Malolos, [[Bulacan]]. It offered Law as well as Medicine, Surgery and Notary Public; Academia Militar,(the Philippine's First Military School) which was established on October 25, 1898; and The Burgos Institute, (the Philippine's first law school) and an exclusive school for boys.

The Congress of the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines]] convened in Barasoain Church in Malolos on September 15, 1898. On the 18th, Aguinaldo proclaimed Malolos as the capital of the Philippines. The first important act of the Congress was the ratification on September 29, 1898, of the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|independence proclamation]] at [[Kawit]], [[Cavite]] of June 12, 1898. On October 19, 1898, by virtue of an act of Congress, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established. It was in Malolos on December 20, 1898, when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo declared December 30 of every year as a day of national mourning. The greatest achievement and for which the Malolos Congress was known was the framing of the [[Malolos Constitution]], prepared by a committee headed by Felipe Calderón, was approved by the congress after amendments have been made on January 20, 1899, sanctioned by Aguinaldo the next day and promulgated on January 22. The last congressional act of the Malolos Congress was the inauguration of the Philippine Republic with Aguinaldo as the President on January 23, 1899, amidst the people's jubilation.

On March 31, 1899, at the height of the [[Philippine–American War]], Aguinaldo ordered Gen. [[Antonio Luna]] to set the Malolos Church including its huge silver altar on fire as part of their strategy called "Scorched-earth Policy" where everything will be rendered useless. Malolos was totally destroyed when the Americans captured the capital. Aguinaldo escaped to [[San Fernando, Pampanga]] before the American Forces arrived at Malolos.

More than a year after the 1899 Battle of Malolos and the victory of and occupation by American forces, the national seat of power was officially conferred again to [[Manila]] and on February 27, 1901, by the virtue of Act No. 88 of the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]], the commission officially transferred the provincial seat from the heavily damaged town of [[Bulakan, Bulacan|Bulakan]] to the nearby town of Malolos and it became the capital of Bulacan.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=88|date=February 27, 1901|accessdate=June 19, 2023|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%2088|title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Bulacan|archive-date=October 21, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231021145736/https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%2088|url-status=live}}</ref> On January 12, 1904, by virtue of Act No. 1038, the former municipalities of Barasoain and Santa Isabel were merged with Malolos, with Barasoain designated as the municipal seat.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1038|date=January 12, 1904|accessdate=June 19, 2023|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201038|title=An Act Amending Act Numbered Nine Hundred and Thirty-two, as Amended, So as to Locate the Seat of Municipal Government of the Municipality of Malolos, of the Province of Bulacan, in the Former Municipality of Barasoain|archive-date=October 21, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231021145736/https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201038|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Casa Presidencia de Malolos was converted as the new Casa Real of Bulacan (became Casa Real Shrine) making it as the new Official Office and Residence of Governor until 1930 when the new Provincial Capitol Building in Barrio Guinhawa, also in Malolos was built.

===Governments of Malolos after the Philippine–American War===
*''During the American Period'' <br> After the War, the Americans appointed a martial law administrator in the person of Jose Reyes Tiongson. He served as "presidente politico militar" from 1901 to 1902.  With the capture of Aguinaldo in [[Palanan]], [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] and the defeat of most of the Filipino armed forces all over the country, the Americans began to put up a network of local government units. The municipality of Malolos was re-organized, composed of the districts of Malolos, Barasoain and Santa Isabel. Appointed "presidente municipal" or town mayor was Ramon Gonzalez de Leon of Sitio Tampoy, one of the original members of the Katipunan Balangay Apuy. He was in the post for two years, 1903 to 1905.  He and the nine others who followed him were all appointive officials. When the Philippines became a [[Philippine Commonwealth|commonwealth]], Leon Valencia was elected mayor in 1937, the first ever elected. Diosdado Dimagiba succeeded him in 1940 but had to vacate the position because of the Japanese conquest. Also in this period, the Malolos Municipal Hall facing the Malolos Church was built, in a manner of Neo-Classical Roman Style.<ref>Malolos Historical Digest, June 2000</ref>
*''During the Japanese Occupation'' <br> The Japanese appointed two "punong bayan" or mayors, Luis Peralta and Ignacio Tapang. After the joint US and Philippine Commonwealth armed forces liberated Malolos in March 1945, Adonis P. Maclang of the guerrillas' Bulacan Military Area was appointed guerrilla mayor of the town, before battle for the liberation of Bulacan, the local Filipino forces of the 3rd and 32nd Infantry Division of the [[History of the Philippine Army#History|Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] was liberated in Malolos to helping the local guerrilla resistance fighters of the Bulacan Guerrilla Unit and American troops of the U.S. Army against the Japanese in 1945 at the end of World War II, followed by the appointment of Isberto Crisostomo as civilian town mayor in 1946. The first post-war election was held in 1946 and Carlos Maclang was elected mayor.

===Contemporary history===
On June 30, 1998, Malolos was the site again for another [[Inauguration of Joseph Estrada|presidential inauguration]], this time of [[Joseph Estrada]] when he was inaugurated at [[Barasoain Church]] as the 13th [[President of the Philippines]]. Estrada, whose real surname is Ejercito, traced his ancestry to the Ejercitos who were prominent in the history of Malolos.

[[File:Malolos flyover.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Malolos Steel Flyover]]
The construction of the Malolos flyover in summer of 2004 marked a new milestone being the first in the city. The structure, part of the former Philippine President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]'s Bridge Program, was constructed in a record-breaking 60 days only according to the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]]. The structure was built to solve daily traffic jams, which have become a bane to motorists and to employees in both private and government offices in the city. This remarkable feat hastened not only the city's development in commerce and trade but also that of its neighboring municipalities as well.

On July 28–30, 2008, the city hosted the first National Conference for Philippine-Spanish Relations. This is a project of both the Province of Bulacan's research arm, the Center for Bulacan Studies of [[Bulacan State University]], and by the Samahang Pangkasaysayan ng Bulacan, Incorporated.

=== Cityhood ===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
In February 1999, [[Bulacan's 1st congressional district]]  representative [[Wilhelmino Sy-Alvarado]] authored a bill converting the then-[[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]] of Malolos into a [[Cities of the Philippines#City classification|component city]], which was approved as ''[[Republic Act]] No. 8754'' on November 4.<ref>''Republic Act No. 8754:''

On May 1, 2009, the bill lapsed into law as ''Republic Act No. 9591'' without the [[President of the Philippines|president]]'s signature, amending the city charter (''RA No. 8754'').<ref name="ra9591h" /><ref name="sc2010" /><ref>{{cite PH act |chamber=RA |number=9591 |url=http://www.op.gov.ph/directives/RA9591.pdf |title=An Act Amending Section 57 of Republic Act No. 8754, otherwise known as the Charter of the City of Malolos |date=May 1, 2009 |access-date=March 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614110048/http://www.op.gov.ph/directives/RA9591.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

In August, the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) issued ''Resolution No. 09-0544'', on the allocation of a legislative district for Malolos, concerning the said law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/resolutions/2010natl_local/mr_09_0544.html |title=Minutes Resolution No. 09-0544 |website=[[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] |publisher=[[Government of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031226/http://www.comelec.gov.ph/resolutions/2010natl_local/mr_09_0544.html |archive-date=February 22, 2012}}</ref>

However, on June 16, four individuals from the city had filed a petition, with the COMELEC as respondent, questioning the constitutionality of ''RA No. 9591''<ref name="sc2010" /> which violated [[Constitution of the Philippines|the 1987 Constitution]] and its Ordinance; both require a population of at least 250,000 for a city to have its own representative in [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]].<ref name="sc2010" /><ref name="d0110tPS" />

===Barangays===
Malolos is politically subdivided into 51 [[barangay]]s that are spread over a land area of {{convert|7725|ha}} consisting of agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential, bodies of water, fishponds, marshes and roads. Many of the name of the barangays were derived from the name of common Philippine trees, because Malolos was once a vast virgin land and forests, before the Spaniards came and Christianized the natives. While others were named in honor of their patron saints.

Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

As of 2015, the Philippine Statistics Authority released the official result of 2015 census in which Malolos has a population of 261,189 people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|261,189/67.25|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or|sp=us}}, an increase of 17,129 people from the 2010 census. There are 52,547 households in the city. Majority of the Malolos households usually lives along the major roads. It has an average crime rate of 6.28% and has a crime solution efficiency of 97.11%.

===Language and ethnicity===
The majority of the Maloleños (or Malolenyo in [[Filipino language|Filipino]]) traces their roots to [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] ethnicity although there are also [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] and other ethnicities who migrated to the city. The vernacular language is [[Filipino language|Filipino]], in the form of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], while [[Philippine English]] is the language most widely used in education and business throughout the city. Although Malolos is the city where the Filipinos established the Spanish as their only official language in the first constitution, the native speakers of Spanish still alive are reduced to the very old members of a handful of families.

===Religion===
[[File:Malolos basilica.jpg|220px|thumb|Malolos Cathedral-Basilica, the principal church of the city and the Province of Bulacan]]
[[File:Santa Isabel Church Malolos.jpeg|220px|thumb|Santa Isabel de Hungaria Church, built in 1673 as visita of Malolos and became Parish in 1859]]

The Christianization of Malolos was done by the [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian Order]] in May 1572 thru the effort of Fray Diego Vivar-Ordonez (parochial vicar of Calumpit, assistant to Fray Diego Herrera and Martin de Rada) and it became one of the visitas of Parish of Nicolas de Tolentino (became San Juan Bautista in 1576). Since 1572 the apostolic administration in Malolos was under the Convent of Calumpit. On June 11, 1580, the mission chapel was accepted by the Augustinians as House of Order and became ''Iglesia Convento y Malolos'' with visitas of Paombong, Matimbo, Mambog and Quingua in 1581. Later due to the frequent high tides that submerged the area, the friars moved the church to its present location in Poblacion in 1590 under the curate Fray Cristobal Tarique, where they started to build a church made of light materials and wood. In 1599 Fray Roque de Barrionuevo started to build a church made of stone and it was finished in 1673. The majority of the residents are Christians. Roman Catholic is the predominant religion in the city.
[[File:Feast of Sto. Niño de Malolos in Bulacan, Philippines.jpg|thumb|Feast of Sto. Niño de Malolos]]
Until today, the [[Roman Catholic]] faith in Malolos remained intensive. It is evident through the existence of the three stone churches. (Malolos Cathedral, Barasoain Church, and the Santa Isabel Church)
Being predominantly Catholic, Malolos, together with the whole province of Bulacan is constituted as ''Vicaria dela Immaculada Concepcion'' in which the (Cura de Malolos is the Vicar Forane). It was part of the Archdiocese of Manila until March 11, 1962, when [[Pope John XXIII]] created the Diocese of Malolos making the Malolos Church its cathedral. In March 2012 the Diocese of Malolos will celebrate its 50th anniversary.
It was highlighted by the Canonical Coronation of the patroness and queen of the city and the whole province, ''Virgen Inmaculada Concepción de Malolos'' enshrined at the cathedral's altar.

Other Christian religious groups, such as [[Methodist]]s, [[Aglipayan]]s, [[Adventism|Adventist]]s, [[Baptist]]s, [[Mormons]], and other [[Protestant]] churches, as well as [[Nontrinitarian]] churches (like [[Members Church of God International]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], and [[Jehovah's Witness]]) can be found in the city.

[[Islam]] ([[Muslim]]s) could also be found in the city.
