'''Yamoussoukro''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|j|æ|m|ʊ|ˈ|s|uː|k|r|oʊ}};<ref name="collins_english">{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/yamoussoukro |title=English Dictionary: Definition of Yamoussoukro |publisher=Collins |access-date=24 August 2013}}</ref> {{IPA|fr|jamusukʁo}}, <small>locally</small> {{IPA|fr|jamsokʁo|}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]] and an autonomous [[Districts of Ivory Coast|district]]. As of the 2014 census, Yamoussoukro is the [[list of cities in Ivory Coast|fifth most populous city in the Ivory Coast]], with a population of 212,670.<ref name="pop"/> Located {{convert|240|km|sp=us}} north-west of [[Abidjan]], the district of Yamoussoukro covers {{convert|2075|sqkm|sp=us}} among rolling hills and plains.

Yamoussoukro became the legal capital of Ivory Coast in 1983, although the former capital Abidjan retains several political functions. Prior to 2011, what is now the district of Yamoussoukro was part of [[Lacs Region]]. The district was created in 2011<ref>Décret n° 2011-263 du 28 septembre 2011 portant organisation du territoire national en Districts et en Régions.</ref> and is split into the [[departments of Ivory Coast|departments]] of [[Attiégouakro Department|Attiégouakro]] and [[Yamoussoukro Department|Yamoussoukro]]. In total, the district contains 169 settlements. Yamoussoukro is a [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefecture]] in Yamoussoukro Department and is also a [[Communes of Ivory Coast|commune]]: since 2012, the city of Yamoussoukro has been the sole commune in the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro.

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2020}}

===Prehistory===
{{main|History of Ivory Coast#Prehistory and early history}}
Stone tools found in the country from hundreds of thousands of years ago show that the area around Yamoussoukro has been occupied since ancient times. Due to the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahara]], many moved south to avoid the harsh conditions.

===Colonial period===
Queen Yamoussou, the niece of Kouassi N'Go, ran the city of ''N'Gokro'' in 1929 at the time of [[French colonization]]. The village of N'Gokro was renamed Yamoussoukro, the suffix ''Kro'' meaning town in [[Baoulé language|Baoule]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Cote d'Ivoire |date=2023-11-14 |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/cote-divoire/ |work=The World Factbook |access-date=2023-11-22 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |language=en}}</ref>

Diplomatic and commercial relations were then established, but in 1909, on the orders of the Chief of Djamlabo, the Akoué revolted against the administration. Bonzi station, {{convert|7|km|mi}} from Yamoussoukro on the [[Bouaflé]] road, was set on fire, and the French administrator, Simon Maurice, was spared only by the intervention of Kouassi N'Go.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Braimah |first=Ayodale |date=2019-01-28 |title=Yamoussoukro, Cote d’Ivoire (1909- ) • |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/yamoussoukro-cote-divoire-1909/ |access-date=2023-11-22 |language=en-US}}</ref>

As the situation got worse, Maurice, judging that Bonzi had become safe, decided to transfer the French military station to Yamoussoukro, where the French Administration built a pyramid to the memory of Kouassi N'Go, Chief of the Akoué, who was assassinated in 1910 by Akoué rebels, accusing him of being too close to the French.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Coates|first1=Carrol F.|title=A Fictive History of Côte d'Ivoire: Kourouma and "Fouphouai"|journal=Research in African Literatures|date=1 January 2007|volume=38|issue=2|pages=124–139|jstor=4618379|doi=10.2979/RAL.2007.38.2.124|s2cid=161600527 }}</ref>

In 1919, the civil station of Yamoussoukro was removed. [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] became the leader of the village in 1939. A long period passed wherein Yamoussoukro, still a small agricultural town, remained in the shadows. This continued until after the Second World War, which saw the creation of the [[African Agricultural Union]], as well as the first conferences of its chief. However, it was only with independence that Yamoussoukro finally started to rise.<ref name="Braimah">{{cite web|last1=Braimah|first1=Ayodale|title=Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire (1909– )|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/yamoussoukro-cote-d-ivoire-1983|website=BlackPast.org|access-date=8 September 2017|archive-date=14 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914085310/http://www.blackpast.org/gah/yamoussoukro-cote-d-ivoire-1983|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1950, the village comprised 500 inhabitants.<ref>Cyril K. Daddieh, ''Historical Dictionary of Cote d'Ivoire (The Ivory Coast)'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 490</ref>

===Since independence===
After 1964, the President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] made ambitious plans and started to build. One day in 1965, later called the Great Lesson of Yamoussoukro, he visited the plantations with the leaders of the county, inviting them to transpose to their own villages the efforts and agricultural achievements of the region. On 21 July 1977, Houphouët offered his plantations to the State.{{cn|date=March 2024}}

In March 1983, President Houphouët-Boigny made Yamoussoukro the political and administrative capital of [[Ivory Coast]], as the city was his birthplace.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 339</ref> This marked the fourth movement of the country's capital city in a century. Ivory Coast's previous capital cities were [[Grand-Bassam]] (1893), [[Bingerville]] (1900), and Abidjan (1933). Most economic activity still takes place in Abidjan, and it is officially designated as the "economic capital" of the country.

Yamoussoukro is the seat of [[Yamoussoukro Department]] and the neighbouring [[Bélier Region]], but Yamoussoukro itself is not part of the region.

==Governance==
[[File:Côte d'Ivoire - District autonome Yamoussoukro.svg|thumb|left|Location of the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro]]
Beginning in 2001, the city was governed as part of the [[Yamoussoukro Department]] and incorporated into [[Lacs Region]]. In 2011, the department was abolished and the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro was created and separated from the rest of Lacs, which became a [[Lacs District|separate district]].

Unlike most [[districts of Ivory Coast|districts]] of the country, the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro is not subdivided into [[regions of Ivory Coast|regions]]. The district, however, is divided into departments, sub-prefectures and a commune. The district consists of the [[Departments of Ivory Coast|departments]] of [[Attiégouakro Department|Attiégouakro]] and [[Yamoussoukro Department|Yamoussoukro]]. The departments further divided into the [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]] of [[Attiégouakro]], [[Kossou]], [[Lolobo, Yamoussoukro|Lolobo]], and Yamoussoukro. There is one [[Communes of Ivory Coast|commune]], which is also named Yamoussoukro, and it shares the same borders as the district. In 2011, the position of Mayor of Yamoussoukro was replaced with a district governor appointed by the head of state.

== Architecture ==
Also noteworthy are the [[Kossou Dam]], the [[PDCI-RDA House]], the schools of the [[Institut National Polytechnique Félix Houphouët-Boigny|Félix Houphouët-Boigny National Polytechnic Institute]], the Town Hall, the Protestant Temple, the Mosque, and the [[Palace of Hosts]]. The [[Yamoussoukro International Airport]] had an average of six hundred passengers and 36 flights in 1995. It is one of two airports in Africa (with [[Gbadolite]]) that could accommodate the [[Concorde]].

== Places of worship ==   
Among the [[places of worship]] are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples: [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Yamoussoukro]] ([[Catholic Church]]), United Methodist Church Ivory Coast ([[World Methodist Council]]), [[Union of Missionary Baptist Churches in Ivory Coast]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Assemblies of God]].<ref>J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‘'Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices'’, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 811-812</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.

Like many other cities in [[West Africa]], Yamoussoukro is affected by the [[harmattan]], which serves as a primary source of the city's [[dry season]].
