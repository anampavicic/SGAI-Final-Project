'''Huai'an''',<!--Chinese in infobox; see [[WP:MOS-ZH]]--> formerly '''Huaiyin''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Jiangsu Province]] in [[East China|Eastern China]]. As of [[2020 Chinese census|2020]], the built-up area (metro) of its 3 central urban districts had 2,544,767 inhabitants and the prefecture-level city as a whole had 4,556,230 inhabitants, down from 4.8 million in [[2010 Chinese census|2010]].

Long an important regional center, Huai'an lies on and is named for the [[Huai River]], the historical boundary between [[Northern China|Northern]] and [[Southern China|Southern Chinese culture]]. Once much closer to the [[East China Sea]], it now lies in the middle of [[Jianghuai]], the vast [[alluvial plain]] created by silt from the Huai and from the [[Yellow River]], which flowed nearby for centuries prior to the massive floods in the mid-19th century which returned it to its old course north of [[Shandong]]. Huai'an is known as the birthplace of [[Han Xin]], a famed general who helped found the [[Han dynasty]] and overwhelm [[Xiang Yu]] in [[Chu–Han Contention|Chu-han contention]]; [[Wu Cheng'en]] (1500–1582), the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] author of ''[[Journey to the West]]''; and [[Zhou Enlai]] (1898–1976), a prominent and early [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist]] leader who served as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] of the [[PRC]] from 1949 until his death in 1976.

{{anchor|Name|Etymology|Toponymy}}

==Names==
Huai'an is the [[Chinese tones|atonal]] [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] pronunciation of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name {{lang|zh|{{linktext|淮安}}}} (''Huái'ān''), the name of the [[River Huai]] and the Chinese word for "peaceful" or "pacified". The apostrophe is necessary because the second character begins with a vowel and pinyin generally avoids hyphens.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.pinyin.info/romanization/hanyu/apostrophes.html |contribution=Apostrophes in Hanyu Pinyin... |url=http://www.pinyin.info |title=Pinyin.info |last=Swofford |first=Mark |location=Banqiao |publisher= |date=2023 }}.</ref> The same name was previously romanized as '''Huai-an''' in [[Wade-Giles]].

For much of the 20th century, Huai'an was officially known as '''Huaiyin''' in pinyin, '''Huai-yin''' in Wade-Giles, and '''Hwaiyin''' in [[Postal Map romanization|Postal Map]], all romanizing the Chinese name written {{lang|zh|{{linktext|淮陰}}}} in [[traditional characters]] and {{lang|zh|{{linktext|淮阴}}}} in [[simplified characters|simplified ones]], meaning "area on the [[yin-yang|yin]], shady, or south [[riverbank|bank]] of the Huai".

==Geography==
Huai'an lies on the [[Huai River]] in the [[alluvial plain|alluvial]] [[Jianghuai Plain]]. The area is very flat with only a few notable hills in [[Xuyi County]]. The highest altitude in the municipality is {{convert|200|m|sp=us}}. The area is notable for its large number of lakes, rivers, and canals. The [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] connects with the Huai in the city. [[Hongze Lake]], the fourth-largest [[lakes of China|freshwater lake in China]], is southwest of the urban districts. Towards the south, there are also several smaller lakes. Huai'an is situated almost directly south of [[Lianyungang]], southeast of [[Suqian]], northwest of [[Yancheng]], and north of [[Yangzhou]] and [[Nanjing]] in [[Jiangsu]] and northeast of [[Chuzhou]] in [[Anhui]].

=== Climate ===
The climate in Huai'an is mild, generally warm and temperate. Winters are much drier than summers. Its [[Köppen climate classification]] is Cwa: humid subtropical climate with dry winters.

===Prehistoric China===
Huai'an lies southeast of the cradle of early [[History of China|Chinese civilization]] on the [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Yellow River]]s. Modern [[Chinese archaeology]] has found remains from [[Neolithic China|Neolithic civilizations]] in the area as far back as the 4th millennium{{nbsp}}BC. The most famous of these is the Qinglianggang culture ({{lang|zh|[[:zh:青莲岗文化|青莲岗文化]]}}). Traditional [[Chinese historiography]] considered the area part of the [[Dongyi]] or "Eastern [[Hua-Yi distinction|Barbarians]]", but [[Chinese myth]] sometimes extended the [[flood control]] efforts of [[Yu the Great]] to the Huai.

===Ancient China===
Under the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], the area became an important agricultural center contested by the [[ancient Chinese states|petty kingdoms]] of the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. In 486{{nbsp}}BC, the [[hegemon (China)|hegemon]] [[Fuchai of Wu|Fuchai]] of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] completed the Han or [[Hangou Canal]] {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|邗溝}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|邗沟}}}},}} ''Hángōu''), connecting his center of power at [[Suzhou]] near the [[Yangtze Delta]] with the Huai River at Huai'an to ease his supply lines in conflicts against [[Qiguo|Qi]]. Increasing in commercial and strategic importance, the town also became a waypoint on the Qian and Shan Roads.{{what?|date=March 2023}} During the [[Warring States period]], the area was held in turn by Wu, [[Yueguo|Yue]], and [[Chuguo|Chu]] before being conquered by [[Shi Huangdi]] of [[Qin dynasty|Qin]].

===Imperial China===
[[File:淮安府大堂.JPG|thumb|250px|Huai'an Prefecture's central offices in imperial times]]
[[File:文通塔.JPG|thumb|250px|Wentong Pagoda]]
Under the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]], the area of present-day Huai'an was administered as the [[county (China)|counties]] or districts of Huaiyin (with its seat at present-day [[Matou, Jiangsu|Matou]] in [[Huaiyin District, Huai'an|Huaiyin]]), Xuyi, and Dongyang (with its seat at present-day [[Maba, Jiangsu|Maba]] in [[Xuyi County|Xuyi]]). Its people joined the rebels who [[fall of Qin|overthrew the Qin]], prominently including [[Han Xin]].

Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], the counties of Huaipu (with its seat in western [[Lianshui County|Lianshui]]), Sheyang (with its seat in southeastern [[Huai'an District|Huai'an]]), and Fulin (with its seat now under the waters of [[Hongze Lake]]) were added.

In [[Jian'an Era|Jian'an]] 5 ({{c.|200}}), near the beginning of the [[Three Kingdoms period]], the [[Guangling Commandery|Guangling]] [[commandery (China)|commander]] [[Chen Deng]]{{mdash}}then subordinate to [[Lü Bu]]{{mdash}}constructed the first 30-[[li (unit)|li]] section of the [[Gaojia Dike]] ({{lang|zh|高家堰}}, ''Gāojiāyàn'') to minimize damage from flooding along the Huai.<ref name=shlwsab>[[#CITEREFSHLWSA7_Sept._2020|SHLWSA (7 Sept. 2020)]].</ref> He also expanded the Hangou Canal westward and combined the small [[Fuling Lakes|Fuling lakes]] into a single [[Pofu Pond]] to assist with [[irrigation in China|irrigation]].

Under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], the Hangou Canal was expanded north and south to establish the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], increasing traffic and trade through the city. [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]] was also responsible for changing Pofu's name to the present-day [[Hongze Lake]] out of his delight at rainfall there, encountered after an inspection tour through drought-afflicted areas.<ref name=huaia>[[#CITEREFHuai'an5_Feb._2018|Huai'an (5 Feb. 2018)]].</ref>

During the [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Kaifeng]]'s governor [[Du Chong]] {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|杜|充}}}},}} ''Dù Chōng'', d.{{nbsp}}1141) breached the levees holding back the Yellow River in 1128 as part of the [[Jin–Song wars|ongoing wars]] with the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jurchen Jin|Jin]] further north. A series of massive floods, manmade and natural, then caused it to [[stream capture|capture]] the [[Si River]] and begin flowing into the lower reaches of the Huai. The massive amounts of silt greatly expanded the farmland to the east of Huai'an but also greatly expanded Hongze Lake<ref name=shlwsa>[[#CITEREFSHLWSA3_Sept._2020|SHLWSA (3 Sept. 2020)]].</ref> and caused repeated and disastrous floods despite centuries of attempts at river management by [[Pan Jixun]] and similar [[Viceroy of Southern Rivers|viceroys]],<ref name=shlwsab/> often based within modern Huai'an.

The [[Ming Dynasty Ancestral Tomb]] ({{lang|zh|明祖陵}}, ''Míngzǔlíng'') is located in [[Xuyi County|Xuyi]]. Now part of Huai'an, the area around it was administered as the separate [[Si Prefecture (Huai valley)|Sizhou Prefecture]] during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], when it was the home of the family of the future [[Hongwu Emperor of Ming|Hongwu Emperor]] Zhu Yuanzhang. Although his family moved to [[Fengyang]] in present-day [[Anhui]] before his birth, he erected a large mausoleum in honor of his grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather after his establishment of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]. The site's was entirely submerged{{mdash}}along with the entire city of Sizhou{{mdash}}in 1680. It did not reappear above water until the early 1960s.{{sfnp|Danielson|2008}}

The original [[Qing Yan Garden]] was first built during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]].

===Modern China===
The area was occupied by the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] during [[World War II]] and administered as part of [[Wang Jingwei]]'s [[Wang Jingwei regime|puppet regime]].

During the closing phases of the [[Chinese Civil War]], it fell to the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] [[People's Liberation Army|army]] in December 1948. On 21 April 1949, the area was reorganized as Huaiyin District and divided into the 10 counties of Guanyun, Huaiyin, Huaibao (western Huai'an and Baoyin with its seat at Chahe), Lianshui, Pisui (southern Pixian and northern Suining with its seat at Tushan), Shuyang, Siyang, Suining, Suqian, and Xin'an (parts of Shuyang and Suqian with its seat at Xin'an).

On 12 May 1950, Huaibao County was divided between Huaiyin County, Huai'an County in Yancheng District, and Baoyin County in Yangzhou District. On December 18 of the same year, the urban area of Huaiyin was separately organized as Qingjiang City, which became the seat for the district. Huaiyin District joined Jiangsu upon its reestablishment in January 1953. Xin'an County was renamed Xinyi and the seat of Pisui County was moved to Yunhe. Later the same year, Pisui, Suining, and Xinyi Counties were placed under the administration of [[Xuzhou District]]. Qingjiang was separately elevated to a prefecture-level city despite still being subordinate to Huaiyin District. Shortly thereafter, the district added Huai'an County from Yancheng, Sihong County from Suxian, and Xuyi County from Chuxian District in Anhui. In 1956, Hongze County was established from parts of Huaiyin, Sihong, and Xuyi Counties, with its seat at Gaoliangjian. In 1957, parts of Guanyun and Lianshui Counties were organized as the Xian'an Administrative Office, which shortly became the separate Guannan County. In 1958, Qingjiang absorbed the surrounding more rural Huaiyin County but was renamed Huaiyin City.

In 1964, Huaiyin County was again separated but kept its seat in the urban area, which again became Qingjiang. In 1966, Xuyi County was transferred to Luhe District.

In 1970, Huaiyin District became the Huaiyin Region. The next year, Xuyi was transferred back from the Luhe Region. Luhe also yielded Jinhu County. In 1975, Huaiyin County's administration moved from Qingjiang to Wangyin.

In 1983, the Huaiyin Region became the directly administered Huaiyin City, with its urban core losing the separate name Qingjiang and being instead divided into [[Qinghe District, Huai'an|Qinghe]] and [[Qingpu District, Huai'an|Qingpu Districts]]. Most of the Huaiyin Region's counties{{mdash}}Guannan, Huai'an, Huaiyin, Hongze, Jinhu, Lianshui, Shuyang, Sihong, Siyang, Suqian, Xuyi{{mdash}}were placed under the city's administration while the last{{mdash}}Guanyun County{{mdash}}was placed under Lianyungang. In December 1987, Huai'an and Suqian Counties were promoted to county-level cities.

In 1996, the county-level city of Suqian was promoted to prefecture-level, taking Sihong, Siyang, and Shuyang Counties along with it. Guannan County was separately placed under the administration of Lianyungang.

On 21 December 2000, the prefecture-level city of Huaiyin was renamed Huai'an. The Huaiyin County and the county-level Huai'an City became Huaiyin and Huai'an Districts and the various districts' and counties' borders slightly adjusted in different ways. In October 2016, Qinghe and Qingpu reunited to form the city's current [[Qingjiangpu District]].

==Culture==
The people of Huai'an are generally [[Nationalities of China|ethnically]] [[Han Chinese]]. The local culture is known as "[[Jianghuai people|Jianghuai]]", referring to its position between the [[Huai River]] and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]], long known poetically in China as simply "The River" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|江}}}}, ''Jiāng''). The local dialect is a form of [[Jianghuai Mandarin|Jianghuai]] or [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]]. Similarly, the local cuisine is [[Jianghuai cuisine|Jianghuai]] or [[Huaiyang cuisine]], historically considered one of the [[Four Great Traditions|four chief styles]] of true [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese cooking]].

==Sports==
The Huai'an City Sports Stadium is a [[soccer|football]] stadium with a capacity of 30,000.

==Transportation==
Huai'an is served by the [[Xinyi-Changxing railway]], which has a station in Huaiyin District.

Being at the intersection of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and [[Huai River]] Huai'an is an important [[inland port]].

The city is also served by nearby [[Huai'an Lianshui International Airport]]. Currently the airport is served by China Eastern Airlines, which offers flights to Beijing-Capital, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai-Hongqiao, Shanghai-Pudong, Wenzhou, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Xi'an. Several other airlines offer domestic flights to cities such as Nanning and Zhengzhou. The airport is located {{convert|22|km|abbr=on}} from central Huai'an in Lianshui county.

Public transportation includes a [[Trams in Huai'an|tram system]] that connects the city center with the southeastern side of the city.
