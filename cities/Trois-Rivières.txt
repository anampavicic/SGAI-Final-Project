'''Trois-Rivières''' ({{IPA|fr|tʁwɑ ʁivjɛʁ|lang}}, {{IPA|fr-CA|tʁwɔ ʁivjaɛ̯ʁ||Qcfr-Trois-Rivières.ogg|label=[[Canadian French]]:}}; {{lit.|Three Rivers}}) is a city in the [[Mauricie]] administrative region of [[Quebec]], Canada, at the confluence of the [[Saint-Maurice River|Saint-Maurice]] and [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] rivers, on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River across from the city of [[Bécancour, Quebec|Bécancour]]. It is part of the densely populated [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor]] and is approximately halfway between [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]]. Trois-Rivières is the economic and cultural hub of the Mauricie region.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/trois-rivieres Trois Rivières] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110080239/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/trois-rivieres |date=November 10, 2018 }} at [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]], accessed September 7, 2019</ref> The settlement was founded by French colonists on July 4, 1634, as the second permanent settlement in [[New France]],<ref>Roy-Sole, Monique. "A Tale of Tenacity", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', April 2009, Vol. 129, No. 2, p. 31.</ref> after Quebec City in 1608.

The name of Trois-Rivières, which dates from the end of the 16th century, was used by French explorers in reference to the three channels in the Saint-Maurice River formed at its mouth with the Saint Lawrence, as it is divided by two islands, Potherie (Île Caron) and [[Saint-Quentin Island|Île Saint-Quentin]]. The city occupies a location near where [[Jacques Cartier]], in a 1535 trip along the St. Lawrence, stopped to plant a cross on Saint-Quentin island. 

Trois-Rivières is also the name of a [[territory equivalent to a regional county municipality]] (TE) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Trois-Rivières. Its geographical code is 371. Together with the [[regional county municipality]] of [[Les Chenaux Regional County Municipality|Les Chenaux]], it forms the [[Census geographic units of Canada|census division]] (CD) of [[Francheville (census division)|Francheville]] (37). The municipalities within Les Chenaux and the former municipalities that were amalgamated into Trois-Rivières formerly constituted the regional county municipality of Francheville. Trois-Rivières is the seat of the [[Judicial districts of Quebec|judicial district]] of the same name.<ref>[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/D_11/D11_A.HTM ''Territorial Division Act''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926125200/http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=%2FD_11%2FD11_A.HTM |date=September 26, 2018 }}.

==City name==
The city's name, which is French for 'three rivers', is named for the fact the Saint-Maurice River has three mouths at the Saint Lawrence River, as it is divided by two islands in the river. 
The ''Trois-Rivières'' name was used for the first time in 1599 by Sieur [[François Gravé Du Pont]], a geographer under Champlain, whose records confirmed the name in 1603. As Sieur Gravé Du Pont sailed upriver toward Montreal, he saw what appeared to be three separate tributaries. He did not know two large islands divide the course of the Saint-Maurice River in three parts where the latter flows into the St. Lawrence River.

Historically, in English this city was once known as '''Three Rivers'''. 
Since the late 20th century, when there has been more recognition of Quebec and French speakers, the city has generally been referred to as ''Trois-Rivières'' in both English and French. The anglicized name still appears in many areas of the town (e.g., the city's [[Three Rivers Academy]]), bearing witness to the influence of English settlers in the town. The city's inhabitants are known as ''Trifluviens'' (Trifluvians).

== History ==
{{See also|Fort Trois-Rivières|Government of Trois-Rivières}}

For thousands of years, the area that would later become known as Trois-Rivières was frequented by indigenous peoples. The historic [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] peoples used it as a summer stopping place. They would fish and hunt here, as well as gather roots and nuts. The area was rich in resources. The French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] described the site while on his second journey to the New World in 1535. 

The name "Trois-Rivières", however, was not given until 1599, by Captain Dupont-Gravé, and first appeared on maps of the area dated 1601.<ref>[http://laville.v3r.net/docs_upload/documents/langue1/renseignements_/Guide_du_citoyen_2007.pdf untitled<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>

In 1603, while surveying the Saint-Lawrence River, [[Samuel de Champlain]] recommended establishing a permanent settlement in the area. The settlement grew into a village, officially formed on July 4, 1634, by its first governor, [[Sieur de Laviolette]]. Early inhabitants of Trois-Rivières included Quentin Moral, Sieur de St-Quentin; future governor [[Pierre Boucher|Pierre Boucher de Grosbois]], François Hertel de la Fresnière (father of [[Joseph-François Hertel de la Fresnière]]), François Marguerie, René Robineau, and Jean Sauvaget, and interpreter Jean Godefroy de Lintot, who married Marie, daughter of Michel Le Neuf.<ref>''Report Concerning the Archives of Canada for the year 1905''.  Vol I. of III., p. li.</ref>

[[Jacques Leneuf de La Poterie]], who would become [[List of governors of Trois-Rivières|governor of Trois-Rivières]], and acting governor of New France, and royal judge Michel Le Neuf du Hérisson, who would be acting governor of Trois-Rivières, brothers, arrived with their widowed mother, Jeanne Le Marchand, in 1636. The Le Neufs were accompanied by Jacques' wife, Marguerite, and her brothers, [[Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny (admiral)|Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny]] and future governor [[Charles Legardeur de Tilly]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lamontagne |first1=Léopold |title=LENEUF DE LA POTERIE, JACQUES |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/leneuf_de_la_poterie_jacques_1E.html |work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1 |publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003– |access-date=1 December 2019 |date=1966 |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223210300/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/leneuf_de_la_poterie_jacques_1E.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city was the second to be founded in [[New France]] (after [[Quebec City]], before [[Montreal]]). Given its strategic location, it played an important role in the colony and in the [[fur trade]] with [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] peoples. The settlement became the seat of a regional [[Government of Trois-Rivières]]  in 1665.  [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] nuns first arrived at the settlement in 1697, where they founded  the first school and helped local missionaries to Christianize the local indigenous people, developing a class of [[Métis]] people.

French sovereignty in Trois-Rivières continued until 1760, when the city was captured as part of the [[Montreal Campaign|British conquest of Canada]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Sixteen years later, on June 8, 1776, it was the theatre of the [[Battle of Trois-Rivières]] (part of the ill-fated [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of the province of Quebec]] by ''les Bostonnais'', Americans from the [[Boston]] area) during the [[American Revolutionary War]] who arrived with the goal of weakening the British settlement.

Trois-Rivières continued to grow in importance throughout this period and beyond. In 1792 it was designated as the seat of a judicial district. In 1852, the Roman Catholic church made this the see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trois-Rivières|Diocese of Trois-Rivières]].

In 1816, Captain A.G. Douglas, a former adjutant at the British military college at Great Marlow, recommended a military college for Catholic and Protestant boys be established at Trois-Rivières. He proposed it operate in a disused government house and he would be superintendent. Douglas' college was intended as a boarding school to educate the young sons of officers, amongst others, in [[Latin]], English, French, history, geography, drawing and mathematics. This preceded the founding of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in 1876.<ref>Richard Preston, ''Canada's RMC: A History of the Royal Military College of Canada'', U of Toronto Press for RMC Club.</ref>

In 1908, the greater part of the city of Trois-Rivières was destroyed by a fire; most of the city's original buildings, many dating to the French colonial years, were destroyed. Among the surviving buildings were the Ursuline Monastery and the De Tonnancour Manor. As a result of the destruction, a major redesign and renovation of the city was undertaken, including the widening and renewal of many of the city's roads. Many new businesses and industries became established in the town, attracting additional residents.

During the mid-century, the city became heavily industrialized and lost jobs during the later restructuring. In the 1960s, Trois-Rivières undertook a large-scale project of economic diversification, including founding several cultural institutions and attractions. The Old City of Trois-Rivières was declared an "historic sector" in 1964. The [[Laviolette Bridge]], linking Trois-Rivières to Bécancour and the south shore of the Saint-Lawrence River, was opened officially on December 20, 1967. In 1969, the city founded the {{Lang|fr|[[Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières]]|italic=no}}, known for its [[chiropractic]] school, its podiatric medical education, and its programs for primary and secondary school education.

Although historically an important centre of commerce, trade and population, Trois-Rivières has been superseded by the two major cities of Quebec: the [[city|metropolis]] of Montreal and the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of Quebec City. It remains as one of the principal medium-sized cities of Quebec, along with [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[Sherbrooke]], and [[Gatineau]].

== Geography ==
=== Islands ===
{{See also|Lake Saint Pierre}}

Saint-Quentin Island lies at the confluence of the [[Saint-Maurice River]] and [[St. Lawrence River]], where the city of Trois-Rivières developed. With the islands ''Saint-Christophe'' and ''De La Poterie'', it creates three [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s at the mouth of the Saint-Maurice River, where it flows into [[St. Lawrence River]]. The island was named in honour of judge Quentin Moral, also said to be a fur trader and one of the first dealers on this island.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Parc-de-l%C3%AEle-Saint-Quentin-%C3%A0-Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res/212154122147344|title=Parc de l'île Saint-Quentin (Québec, Canada)|website=Parc de l'île Saint-Quentin (Québec, Canada)|access-date=November 1, 2017|archive-date=September 24, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230924184115/https://www.facebook.com/ilesaintquentin/|url-status=live}}</ref> It is now a centre of popular outdoor activities and relaxation at the heart of city. The patron saint of the island is [[Saint Quentin|Quentin de Rome]].

It was first inhabited by an [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquin]] tribe who cultivate corn in the lowlands of the river. On October 7, 1535, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a [[Cross (symbol)|cross]] on the island and proclaimed the sovereignty of France on this territory. A commemorative wrought iron cross was erected at the site associated with Cartier's claim. The natural environment of Saint-Quentin has remained virtually unchanged. For nearly a century, it was not developed or cultivated.

Since 1930, the island has become more important as a destination for recreation. The island belonged at the time to Quebec Savings and Trust Company Limited and the Canada Power and Paper Corporation. The city bid for the land in 1933, but did not take ownership until November 3, 1947. <!-- and how was that achieved? --> During World War II, it was the site of a training camp for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. Services were gradually introduced in 1950.

The park and the beach on the island Saint-Quentin were officially inaugurated on June 24, 1962, in the presence of 5,000 people. There were more than 100 000 visitors that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.v3r.net/|title=Accueil - Site officiel de la Ville de Trois-Rivières|first=Ville de|last=Trois-Rivières|website=Ville de Trois-Rivières|access-date=June 16, 2004|archive-date=September 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905133709/http://www.v3r.net/|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, many facilities have been developed on the island, including a [[marina]], a [[bike path]], an interpretative trail, an [[ice rink]], and [[camping]] ground. Several happenings and [[festival]]s are held annually on the island.

"A Tale of Tenacity", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', April 2009, Vol. 129, No. 2, p. 35</ref>

From the late 1920s until the early 1960s, the city was known as the [[pulp and paper industry]] capital of the world.<ref>Roy-Sole, Monique. "A Tale of Tenacity", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', April 2009, Vol. 129, No. 2, p. 36</ref> The city once had five mills in operation (Trois-Rivières Ouest, Wayagamack, C.I.P., and St-Maurice Paper). Today, there are three mills left operating (Kruger Trois-Rivières Ouest, Kruger Wayagamack and Cascades Lupel ex-St-Maurice Paper); the closures resulted largely to a decline in newsprint demand and globalization. The closures were not limited to just the pulp and paper industry. Trois-Rivières had an [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] in the 1980s and 1990s, when several textile mills were closed after owners moved jobs offshore. Unemployment rose to 14 percent in the 1990s.<ref>Roy-Sole, Monique. "A Tale of Tenacity", ''Canadian Geographic Magazine'', April 2009, Vol. 129, No. 2, p. 37</ref>

Trois-Rivières is attempting an industrial revitalization by establishing technology parks and taking advantage of its central location to both Montreal and Quebec City, its university and port. An example of the new economy is Marmen Incorporated, which manufactures [[wind turbine]] towers and employs 1,000 people between its operations in Trois-Rivières and [[Matane]].

The city's other prominent industries include [[Metallurgy|metal transformation]], [[electronics]], [[thermoplastic]]s, and [[cabinet making]]. An industrial park adjoining [[Trois-Rivières Airport]] serves also as a major centre for the [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] industry. Also, the production of [[food crop]]s is still important to the economy.

== Arts and culture ==
Trois-Rivières hosts the FestiVoix de Trois-Rivières, a 10-day summer [[music festival]] which attracts in excess of 300,000 visitors annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festivoix.com/ |title=Le FestiVoix de Trois-Rivières |access-date=2009-04-03 |archive-date=April 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413094407/http://www.festivoix.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The city also hosts the Festival International de la Poésie&nbsp;– an international [[:Category:Poetry festivals|poetry festival]]&nbsp;– as well as the Festival International Danse Encore,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-encore.com |title=Accueil |publisher=Festival encore |access-date=2012-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721102811/http://www.festival-encore.com/ |archive-date=2012-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the MetalFest de Trois-Rivières every November.

An International Festival of Poetry is held annually in the first week of October. <!-- Wouldn't the festival be the reason for the nickname? Where were each established? -->

The city's main thoroughfare is Boulevard des Forges, an area several blocks long in the heart of the Old Town composed of century-old buildings housing a great variety of cafés, restaurants, clubs, bars, and shops. In the warmer months, the area is regularly closed to vehicular traffic to accommodate various festivals and events, turning the downtown core into a [[pedestrian mall]].

Notable landmarks include the [[Forges du Saint-Maurice]], a [[foundry]] dating back to the 1730s, the [[Ursulines]] Monastery, and [[Notre-Dame-du-Cap Basilica]].

Local bus service is provided by the [[Société de transport de Trois-Rivières]]. The [[Laviolette Bridge]] links Trois-Rivières to [[Bécancour, Quebec|Bécancour]] of the [[Centre-du-Québec]] administrative region on the south shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The Laviolette Bridge is the only bridge across the Saint Lawrence River between [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]]; therefore it provides an important connection between the north and south shores of the river. Known for its impressive structure, its elegant aesthetics, the bridge has become a major landmark of Trois-Rivières and the [[Mauricie]] region. Approximately 40,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day. An [[Trois-Rivières Airport|airport]] also serves the city. 

Passenger rail service was provided to [[Trois-Rivières station]] as recently as 1990, but was suspended as part of service cuts by [[Via Rail]]. However, in 2022 Via Rail proposed adding passenger rail service again to Trois-Rivières as part of its [[High Frequency Rail]] project that would link [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[Montréal]] and [[Québec City]].

On April 8, 2014, during morning commute an SUV fell into a giant pothole in Trois-Rivières caused by heavy rain accumulation. Nobody was injured during the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/giant-pothole-swallows-suv-in-trois-rivi%C3%A8res-1.2602793?cmp=fbtl|title=Giant pothole swallows SUV|access-date=April 8, 2014|archive-date=April 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410203745/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/giant-pothole-swallows-suv-in-trois-rivi%C3%A8res-1.2602793?cmp=fbtl|url-status=live}}</ref>
