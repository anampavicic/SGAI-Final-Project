'''Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky''' ({{langx|ru|Петропавловск-Камчатский}}, {{IPA|ru|pʲɪtrɐˈpavləfsk kɐmˈtɕatskʲɪj|IPA|Петропавловск-Камчатский.ogg}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Kamchatka Krai]], [[Russia]]. It is located in the [[Russian Far East|far east]] of the country and lies along the coast of [[Avacha Bay]] by the [[Pacific Ocean]]. As of the 2021 census, it had a population of 164,900.<ref name=2021Census>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref>

The city is widely known simply as ''Petropavlovsk'' (literally "city of [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[St. Paul|Paul]]"). The adjective ''Kamchatsky'' ("Kamchatkan") was added to the official name in 1924.

==History==
{{stack|[[File:Tebenkov-Petropavlosk.png|thumb|Section of [[Mikhail Tebenkov]]'s 1872 Petropavlovsk harbor chart]]}}

===Origins===
[[Cossacks|Cossack]] units visited the area from 1697. The explorer and navigator Captain [[Vitus Bering]] (a Danish-born Russian) is considered{{by whom|date=June 2019}} to have founded the city in 1740, although navigator {{ill|Ivan Fomich Yelagin|ru|Елагин, Иван Фомич}} had laid the foundation a few months earlier. Bering reached Avacha Bay in late 1740 and in his capacity as the superior officer, named the new settlement "Petropavlovsk" (Peter and Paul) after his two ships, the ''[[Saint Peter]]'' and the ''[[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'', which had been built in [[Okhotsk]] for his second expedition (1733–42). The town's location on the eastern coast of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], on the sheltered Avacha Bay and at the mouth of the [[Avacha River]], saw it develop to become the most important settlement in Kamchatka. It gained town status on 9 April 1812.

===Crimean War===
During the 1853–55 [[Crimean War]], Anglo-French forces initiated the [[Siege of Petropavlovsk]] (August–September 1854), but it never fell. The city had been fortified under the overall command of [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky|Nikolay Muravyov]] ([[Governorate-General (Russian Empire)|Governor-General]] of the {{ill|Eastern Siberia Governorate-General|ru|Восточно-Сибирское генерал-губернаторство}} from 1847 to 1861) in the preceding years, but possessed only a small garrison of a few hundred soldiers and sixty-seven cannon. After much exchange of fire, six hundred Anglo-French troops landed south of the city; two hundred and thirty Russian troops forced them to retreat after heavy fighting (1 September 1854). Four days later, a larger force of nine hundred Anglo-French troops landed east of the town, but again the Russians repelled the allies (5 September 1854). The allied ships then retreated from Russian Pacific waters (7 September 1854). The total Russian losses were reported {{by whom|date=June 2019}} at around a hundred men; the Anglo-French were said to have lost 209 men, over twice that number.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|title=Western warfare 1775–1882|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21472-0|page=80}}</ref>

===Post-World War 2===
At the time of the [[surrender of Japan]] in [[World War II]] (August/September 1945), [[Seabee|United States Naval Construction Battalion]] 114 was in the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]]. In September 1945 the battalion received orders to send a detachment to the [[USSR]] to build a Naval Advance Base (a Fleet Weather Central)<ref>The 114th CB cruisebook, 1946, U.S.Navy Seabee Museum Archives, [[Port Hueneme, California]], pp. 123-125 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4nwmm4QfSXQC&pg=PA123]</ref> – located ten miles outside Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and  code-named TAMA.<ref name="Yanks">"Yanks in Siberia: U.S. Navy Weather Stations in Soviet East Asia, 1945", G. Patrick March, ''Pacific Historical Review'', Vol. 57, No. 3 (August 1988), pp. 327–342, Published by: University of California Press. {{JSTOR|3640708}}</ref> The original agreement gave the Seabees three weeks to complete the camp. Upon arrival the Soviets told the Seabees they had ten days, and were amazed that the Seabees achieved the task. It was one of two to which [[Stalin]] agreed. The other was near [[Khabarovsk]], in buildings provided by the Russians.<ref name="Yanks" />  For mail Petropavlovsk was assigned Navy number 1169, FPO San Francisco.<ref>"[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/u/us-navy-abbreviations-of-ww2/navy-numbers.html US Navy Abbreviations of World War II --N--Navy Numbers]", The Navy Department Library, NHHC; published 23 July 2015.</ref> The American use of these two bases proved short-lived.

Petropavlovsk was a great source of fish, particularly [[salmon]], and [[crab]] meat for the [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century. Following the [[End of the Soviet Union|end of the Soviet era]] in December 1991, fishing rights have also been granted to foreign interests. [[Poaching]] of salmon for their [[caviar]] at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy remains a problem amid lax law-enforcement and widespread corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11439051 |title=Poaching in Far Eastern Russia Threatens Ecosystem |publisher=NPR |date=22 July 2007 |access-date=29 June 2014 |author=Feifer, Gregory |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133125/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11439051 |archive-date=9 May 2015 }}</ref>

===2020 earthquake===
A {{M|w}} 7.5 [[Kamchatka earthquakes#2020 earthquake|earthquake occurred on March 25, 2020]]. The earthquake was the largest to occur in Russia since the 2013 Okhotsk Sea earthquake. In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, 285 miles (460km) away from the epicenter, the intensity was felt at 5: objects fell in buildings and people ran out into the street for safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usb000h4jh/executive|title=M8.3 - Sea of Okhotsk|access-date=24 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.znak.com/2020-03-25/zhiteli_petropavlovska_kamchatskogo_snyali_na_video_zemletryasenie|title=Жители Петропавловска-Камчатского сняли на видео землетрясение}}</ref>

==Administrative and municipal status==
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is the [[administrative center]] of [[Kamchatka Krai]].<ref name="Ref42">Law #46</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated as Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Krai Jurisdiction]] — an administrative unit with status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Kamchatka Krai|districts]].<ref name="Ref42" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Urban Okrug.<ref name="Ref729">Law #220</ref>

==Geography==
The city is situated at sea level and surrounded by [[volcanoes]]. The surrounding terrain is mountainous enough that the horizon cannot be seen clearly from any point in town. Across [[Avacha Bay]] from the city in [[Vilyuchinsk]] is Russia's largest [[submarine base]], the Rybachiy Nuclear Submarine Base, established during the Soviet period and still used by the [[Russian Navy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/russia/naval/nucflt/pacflt/rybachiy.htm |website=NTI  |title=Russia |access-date=2011-12-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106140812/http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/Russia/naval/nucflt/pacflt/rybachiy.htm |archive-date=November 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The city is located {{convert|6766|km|}} from [[Moscow]]  and about {{convert|2220|km}} from [[Vladivostok]].

===Climate===
The [[climate]] at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy reasonably qualifies as a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfc''), falling just short of a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''). However, this area's climate has strong oceanic influences due its proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|1180|mm|sp=us}}, or about {{frac|3|1|2}} times as much as most of [[Siberia]] averages, mostly falling as frozen precipitation, primarily [[snow]], from November to April. Average monthly precipitation is highest in autumn, with October the wettest month on average, closely followed by November. May through July are markedly the driest months on average; June is the single driest month. Winter temperatures are much milder than in Siberia. Here, average January daytime high temperatures are around {{convert|-4.0|C}}, while average daytime high temperature in August, the warmest month, is {{convert|17|C}}. Thus, resulting from oceanic cooling, summer daytime high temperatures in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy are markedly cooler than in interior Siberia. In warmer-summer years, monthly high averages in July–August can reach {{convert|18|C}} and higher. Days of above {{convert|20|C|}} can be expected an average of 19.6 days per summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pogoda.ru.net/monitor.php?id=32583&month=8&year=2006 |title=Погода в Петропавловск-Камчатском - климатический монитор за август 2006 года |access-date=2011-12-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601124725/http://pogoda.ru.net/monitor.php?id=32583&month=8&year=2006 |archive-date=June 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} [[Hydrometeorological Centre of Russia]]</ref>

Despite the generally high precipitation, the weather is less cloudy than in the adjacent [[Kuril Islands]] that are one of the least sunny places in the world,<ref>See [http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/europe/russia/simusir_e.htm Climatological Norms of Simusir Island] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924055102/http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/europe/russia/simusir_e.htm |date=September 24, 2012 }}</ref> since the city is located behind a peninsula to the north that blocks some of the [[fog]] from the cold [[Oyashio Current]] offshore of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Oceanic water in Avacha Bay and adjacent bays is also warmer than coastal waters of Kuril Islands and Okhotsk sea coast (except Southern Kuriles and Southern Sakhalin).

In the spring (February to April), seawater may freeze.

Highest Temperature: {{convert|30.0|C}} on July 2, 2012

Lowest Temperature: {{convert|-31.7|C}} on February 14, 1917

Highest Daily Precipitation: {{convert|200.2|mm}} on November 10, 2002

Wettest Year: {{convert|1996|mm}} in 1971

Driest Year: {{convert|432|mm}} in 1947
