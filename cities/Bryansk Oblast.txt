'''Bryansk Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Бря́нская о́бласть|Bryanskaya oblastʹ}}), also known as '''Bryanshchina''' ({{langx|ru|Брянщина|label=none}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈbrʲænʲɕːɪnə|IPA}}), is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Bryansk]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]], its population was&nbsp;1,169,161.<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Infobox city
|module ={{Infobox mapframe|display=right|wikidata=yes|zoom=7|marker=|coord={{WikidataCoord|display=i}}}}
}}
Bryansk Oblast lies in western [[European Russia]] in the central to western parts of the [[East European Plain]], on the divide between the [[Desna River|Desna]] and [[Volga River|Volga]] [[drainage basin|basins]]. The [[oblast]] borders with [[Smolensk Oblast]] in the north, [[Kaluga Oblast]] in the northeast, [[Oryol Oblast]] in the east, [[Kursk Oblast]] in the southeast, [[Chernihiv Oblast|Chernihiv]] and [[Sumy Oblast]]s of [[Ukraine]] in the south, and with [[Gomel Region|Gomel]] and [[Mogilev Region|Mogilev Oblasts]] of [[Belarus]] in the west.

Natural resources include deposits of [[peat]], [[sand]], [[clay]], [[chalk]], [[marl]], and other building materials, as well as [[phosphorite]]. About a quarter of the total area of the oblast is covered by forests, mainly [[pinophyta|coniferous]], mixed, and [[deciduous]], as well as forest-steppe.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

[[Bryansky Les Nature Reserve]] is a biosphere reserve that protects, among other things, a limited population of [[European bison]].{{cn|date=August 2024}}

===Ecology===
As a result of the [[Chernobyl disaster]] on April&nbsp;26, 1986, part of the territory of Bryansk Oblast (mainly [[Gordeyevsky District|Gordeyevsky]], [[Klimovsky District|Klimovsky]], [[Klintsovsky District|Klintsovsky]], [[Krasnogorsky District, Bryansk Oblast|Krasnogorsky]], [[Surazhsky District|Surazhsky]], and [[Novozybkovsky District]]s) has been contaminated with [[radionuclide]]s. In 1999, some 226,000 people, representing approximately 16% of the oblast's population, lived in areas with the contamination level above 5&nbsp;Curie/km<sup>2</sup>.

==History==
The [[Venus of Eliseevichi]] is a piece of [[Paleolithic]] art (dated to 14,000 [[YBP]]) found in the region.<ref>[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/prehistoric/venus-of-eliseevichi.htm Venus of Eliseevichi]</ref> The Eliseevichi site is also associated with the earliest recognized dog remains, dating to 15,000 YBP.<ref name=sablin2002>{{cite journal|author= Sablin, M.|s2cid= 144574445|year= 2002|title= The earliest Ice Age dogs: Evidence from Eliseevichi I| journal= Current Anthropology|volume= 43|issue= 5|pages= 795–799|doi= 10.1086/344372}}</ref><ref name=thalmann2013>{{Cite journal|author= Thalmann, O.|year= 2013|title= Complete mitochondrial genomes of ancient canids suggest a European origin of domestic dogs|journal= Science|doi= 10.1126/science.1243650|pmid= 24233726|volume= 342|issue= 6160|pages= 871–4|bibcode= 2013Sci...342..871T|s2cid= 1526260}}</ref>

In the 9th to 11th centuries AD [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes lived along the banks of the [[Desna River]] and in the forests of the land between the Desna and the [[Oka River|Oka]]. The city of Bryansk was established in 985.<ref name="Cherno">{{cite web|url= http://www.chernobyl.info/index.php?userhash=&navID=561&lID=2|title= Bryansk Oblast|publisher= Chernobyl Info|access-date= May 31, 2010}}{{dead link|date= July 2017 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}</ref>

Bryansk remained poorly attested until the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|1237-1242 Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus']]. It was the northernmost of the [[Severia]]n cities in the possession of the [[Chernigov]] [[Rurikids]] and the [[Principality of Novgorod-Seversk]]. After the Mongols murdered Prince [[Mikhail of Chernigov]] in 1246 and his capital was destroyed, his son [[Roman Mikhailovich (Prince of Chernigov)|Roman Mikhailovich]] moved his seat to Bryansk. In 1310, when the Mongols sacked the town again, it belonged to the principality of [[Smolensk]]. After the Mongols took Chernigov, the Principality of Bryansk was formed. In 1356 Bryansk territory was under the authority of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].
[[File:Спасский монастырь в Севске, ныне школа-интернат..JPG|thumb|left|Holy Transfiguration monastery in [[Sevsk, Bryansk Oblast|Sevsk]], one of the oldest cultural heritage monuments in the province]]

The [[Great Duchy of Moscow]] conquered Bryansk following the [[Battle of Vedrosha]] in 1503. The town was turned into a fortress that played a major role during the [[Time of Troubles]] of 1598–1613. Bryansk became Moscow's south-western outpost in the fights against [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], and [[Crimean Khanate]]. In 1618 the [[Truce of Deulino]] saw the southern and western area of the modern Bryansk Oblast ceded to Poland.

After the annexation of the lands by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1654, all the left bank of the [[Dnieper]], including the south-western area of Bryansk, was divided into hundreds of administrative regiments. One of the largest was [[Starodub]]. In 1781, these regiments merged into districts and several territories.

[[Peter the Great]] ({{reign | 1682 | 1725}}) incorporated Bryansk into the [[Kiev Governorate]], but Empress [[Catherine the Great]] deemed it wise to transfer the town to the [[Oryol Governorate]] in 1779. She also promulgated the town's coat of arms.

In 1709, part of the Bryansk ([[Bryansky Uyezd|Bryansky]], [[Karachevsky Uyezd|Karachevsky]], [[Sevsky Uyezd|Sevsky]], and [[Trubchevsky Uyezd]]s) belonged to [[Kiev Governorate (1708–1764)|Kiev Governorate]]. In 1727, {{Ill|Sevsk Province|lt=Sevsk Province|ru|Севская_провинция}} became part of the newly formed [[Belgorod Governorate]].

The 17th and 18th centuries saw a period of significant regional economic development. The industrial revolution began in the 18th century, particularly in the eastern part of Bryansk; due to its reserves of sand Bryansk saw the growth of the glass industry.
[[File:Брянск - Рождественская гора.jpg|thumb|[[Bryansk]] in the 1900s]]

On April&nbsp;1, 1920, Bryansk Oblast was established but on October&nbsp;1, 1929 it was incorporated into the [[Western Oblast]]. On September&nbsp;27, 1937, the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]] decided to abolish the Western Krai, dividing it into Smolensk and Oryol Oblasts. The current territory of Bryansk Oblast became a part of [[Oryol Oblast]].

In August–October 1941 [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops took over the region. From the first days of occupation, the struggle against the invaders took on the character of a popular movement. In the Bryansk area about 60,000 guerrillas from the guerrilla units of [[Sydir Kovpak]], [[Oleksiy Fedorov]] and [[Alexander Saburov]] operated. The fighting resulted in the destruction and burning of many towns and villages, affecting some 111,000 homes and many important industrial enterprises. After the [[Red Army]] liberated the area (August–September 1943), extensive restoration work commenced.

==Politics==
[[File:Bryansk Duma.JPG|thumb|Oblast Duma seat in Bryansk]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the First Secretary of the Bryansk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the Chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power).

The Charter of Bryansk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Bryansk Oblast Duma]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter under the [[Constitution of Russia]].

The current [[governor of Bryansk Oblast]] since 2015 is [[Alexander Bogomaz]], a member of the [[United Russia]] party. He was re-elected in 2020, winning 71.7% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.bryanskobl.ru/governora Губернатор Брянской области]</ref>

"'Church of the Ascension in the village of Veliky Bor'"
[[File:Разрушенная церковь в селе Великий Бор Гордеевского района.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the church in the village Veliky Bor of Gordeevsky district of Bryansk region built in 1809]]
The supplier on the hill of intermediaries is the compositional center of his development. Year of construction of the church (by order of Count Bezborodko) - 1809. By now, the side porticos and the top of the bell tower have been lost. An interesting example of a cross-shaped manor church in the style of mature classicism. Around the building were comparatively short sidearms, which were slightly protruding rectangular altars ending in a lowered semicircular apse.

The originality of the composition is given by a large light quadrangle towering over the center with a tetrahedral dome cover and a small dome on a cubic pedestal. A small refectory with one window on the side facades is adjoined by a preserved quadrangle of the bell tower. A profiled belt bypasses all facades of the building at the level of the apse cornice. Four Tuscan pilasters decorating the ends of the side arms correspond to the columns of the lost porticoes.

Between them, in the center, there are side entrances marked with triangular sandrids, and on the sides - rectangular windows. Above the openings, there are, respectively, an oval and two round niches. A large semicircular three-part Empire-type window is cut in the upper part of each quadrangle facet. The tier of the bell tower is decorated with large flat-arched niches in the center of the facets, rusticated corner parts to the waist, and round niches-medallions above it. In the interior, all the side parts are completely open into the high central one, forming a single space of the temple.

The central part is covered with a four-lane closed vault, the altar is covered with a conch, and the altar vima, the side arms, and the refectory are covered with cylindrical vaults. The lower tier of the bell tower with rounded inner corners has a corrugated vault along the north–south axis. On the sides of the trapezoidal passage to the refectory, there are small rooms with a staircase in the southern one. Only the plaster cornices at the base of the vaults and at the top of the main quadrangle, as well as pilasters between the windows on the north and south walls, have survived from the interior decoration.

==Heraldry==
{{Main|Flag of Bryansk Oblast}}
The Flag of Bryansk Oblast represents a panel burgundy with a ratio of 1:1,5. In the center of the cloth is placed the coat of arms of the Bryansk region and includes a hammer and sickle up top. The coat of arms is a blue shield representing Slavic unity between the states of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. In the upper part of the shield is a stylized golden spruce with a three-tiered crown representing the forests of Bryansk. The flag is [[burgundy (color)|burgundy]] in color, representing the color of the banners under which the army and guerrillas fought for the liberation of Bryansk.
