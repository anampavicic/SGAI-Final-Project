[[File:Zhuzhou Railway Station 20170726 134725.jpg|thumb|Zhuzhou Railway Station in July 2017]]
Zhuzhou is a very important transportation junction in South China. The [[Beijing–Guangzhou railway]] and the [[Shanghai–Kunming railway]] meet here, which makes [[Zhuzhou railway station]], conveniently located in downtown Zhuzhou, one of the five special class passenger-and-goods transportation stations in China. On average, a train passes through every three minutes. Zhuzhou North Station is the largest goods transportation marshalling station in South China, with 110 trains and more than 30,000 passengers passing through every day.

The [[Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway]] serves the city as well. As almost everywhere along this line, the high-speed railway is routed away from the city core. High-speed trains to Guangzhou, Wuhan, Beijing, Xi'an and points in between stop at [[Zhuzhou West railway station]], which is located about {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} to the west of downtown Zhuzhou.

As well through its comprehensive railway system, Zhuzhou is connected to the rest of the country by 106 National Highway, 320 National Highway, 211 Provincial Highway, the [[Beijing]]–[[Zhuhai]] expressway, the [[Shanghai]]–[[Ruili]] expressway, and three highways linking south [[Fujian]], south [[Jiangxi]] and south Hunan Province.

Zhuzhou is {{convert|37|km|abbr=off}} away from [[Changsha Huanghua International Airport]]. It takes about 30 minutes to drive to the airport by the [[Changsha]]–Zhuzhou Highway.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Su |first=Yi |date=2010-01-18 |title=长株高速有望节前通车 株洲半小时到黄花机场 |trans-title=The Changzhu Expressway is expected to be open to traffic before the festival, and Zhuzhou will reach Huanghua Airport in half an hour. |url=https://hunan.voc.com.cn/article/201001/201001180925297226.html |access-date=2024-05-16 |website=华声新闻 |language=zh}}</ref>

The [[Xiang River]] (Xiangjiang) flows through Zhuzhou, which makes it one of the eight river ports of Hunan Province.

Phase 1 of the world's first [[Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit]] (ART) system, opened in 2018 and was later extended.  The system uses 300 passenger rubber tyred vehicles capable of both following markings on the roadway and being steered by a driver.  It is commonly called either a "guided bus" and a "trackless tram".  The system was developed by the [[CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive|CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Research Institute]].
