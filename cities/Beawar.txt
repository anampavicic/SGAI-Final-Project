==History==
[[File:Duncan MacLaren Young Sommerville 1.jpg|thumb|[[Duncan Sommerville]]|225x225px|left|alt=]]
In the early 19th century, Beawar was a village. By 1825, the [[East India Company|British]] acquired control of the [[Ajmer-Merwara]] region, and established a cantonment around 4 miles from the existing village. In 1836, they attracted merchants and constructed a [[bazaar]] (market), which became the core of a site called "Naya Shahar" or "Naya Nagar" ("New Town").<ref name="JH"/> Colonel George Dickson (1795–1857) established this new town on the waste land adjacent to the cantonment and the original Beawar village. The area eventually evolved into the present-day town of Beawar.<ref>{{cite book |author=V.K. Vashishtha |chapter=Growth of Beawar as an Urban Centre |editor=V. K. Chavda |title=Studies in Trade and Urbanisation in Western India |year=1985 |publisher=Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1XaAAAAMAAJ }}</ref>

The population of the town rose substantially over the next decade, as it became the centre of cotton trade. In 1871, the battalion was moved from the local cantonment to Ajmer, but the town continued remained an important trading centre.<ref name="JH">{{cite book |author=James Heitzman |title=The City in South Asia |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780203483282 |doi=10.4324/9780203483282 |pages=133–134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdcnAgh_StUC&pg=PA134 }}</ref>

A municipality was established at Beawar in 1866.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rima Hooja |title=A History of Rajasthan |year=2006 |publisher=Rupa |isbn=9788129108906 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tosMAQAAMAAJ |page=1166}}</ref> In 1880, railway reached the town, and in 1881, Krishna Cotton Mill was established there. By 1901, the town had a population of 21,928, with 48.6 of the work force employed in the manufacturing sector (38% in cotton textiles industry). Metalwork, [[calico]] printing, and grain trade were the other important industries of the town.<ref name="JH"/>
