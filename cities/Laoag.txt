'''Laoag''' ({{IPA|tl|laʊˈag|}}), officially the '''City of Laoag''' ({{langx|ilo|Siudad ti Laoag}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Laoag}}), is a 3rd class [[component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]].  According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 111,651 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the province's most populous, political, commercial, and industrial hub and the location of Ilocos Region's busiest [[Laoag International Airport|commercial airport]]. It is also the northernmost city in the Philippines.

The municipalities of [[San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte|San Nicolas]], [[Paoay, Ilocos Norte|Paoay]], [[Sarrat, Ilocos Norte|Sarrat]], [[Piddig, Ilocos Norte|Piddig]], [[Vintar, Ilocos Norte|Vintar]], and [[Bacarra, Ilocos Norte|Bacarra]] form its boundaries. The foothills of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] mountain range to the east, and the [[South China Sea]] to the west are its physical boundaries.

Laoag experiences the prevailing [[monsoon]] climate of Northern [[Luzon]], characterized by a dry season from November to April and a wet season from May to October, occasionally visited by powerful [[typhoon]]s. Laoag is also called the "Sunshine City"

==History==
[[File:Laoag1923.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Laoag, 21 July 1923 11:06 am]]

Long before the coming of the Spaniards, there already existed an extensive region consisting of the present provinces of [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Abra (province)|Abra]], and [[La Union]] renowned for its gold mines.  Merchants from [[Japan]] and [[China]] would often visit the area to trade gold with beads, ceramics, and silk.  The [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] inhabitants of the region called their place ''samtoy'', from ''sao mi itoy'', which literally meant "this is our language."{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In 1571, when the [[Spanish conquistadors]] had [[Manila]] more or less under their control, they began looking for new sites to conquer. Legaspi's grandson, Juan de Salcedo, volunteered to lead one of these expeditions.  Together with eight armed boats and 45 men, the 22-year-old voyager headed north.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

On June 13, 1572, Salcedo and his men landed in [[Vigan]] and then proceeded towards Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc.  As they sailed along the coast, they were surprised to see numerous sheltered [[cove]]s (''looc'') where the locals lived in harmony.  As a result, they named the region "Ylocos" and its people "Ylocanos".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

As the [[Christianization]] of the region grew, so did the landscape of the area.  Vast tracts of land were utilized for churches and bell towers in line with the Spanish mission of {{lang|es|bajo de las campanas}} ('under the bells') – a proclamation by King Philip's 1573 [[Law of the Indies]]. In the town plaza, it was not uncommon to see garrisons under the church bells.  The colonization process was slowly being carried out.

The [[Spanish occupation of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]] of the region, however, was never completely successful. Owing to the abusive practices of many [[Augustinian friars]], a number of Ilocanos revolted against their colonizers.  Noteworthy of these were the Dingras uprising (1589) and Pedro Almasan revolt in San Nicolas (1660).  In 1762, [[Diego Silang]] led a series of battles aimed at freeing the Ilocanos from the Spanish yoke.  When he died from an assassin's bullet, his widow Gabriela continued the cause.  Unfortunately, she too was captured and hanged. In 1807, the [[sugar cane]] (''basi'') brewers of Piddig rose up in arms to protest the government's monopoly of the wine industry.  In 1898, the church excommunicated Gregorio Aglipay for refusing to cut off ties with the revolutionary forces of Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].  Unperturbed, he established the {{lang|es|Iglesia Filipina Independiente|italic=no}}.  Aglipay's movement and the national sentiment it espoused helped restore the self-respect of many [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].

{{stack|float=right|[[File:A street of Laoag, the capital of Ilocos Norte, 1900-1913.jpg|thumb|left|A street of Laoag, the capital of Ilocos Norte, 1900–1913]]}}
"The great increase in population from 1715 to 1818 from 18,980 to 282,845 made the administration of the province very difficult. Due to the excessive monopolies and forced labor, there were several uprisings: first by the people of Dingras in 1589; one that was led by Pedro Almazan in 1616; the revolt of [[Diego Silang]] in 1762–1763; by Ambaristo in 1788; by Pedro Mateo in 1808 (also known as [[Basi Revolt]]) and uprising of Sarrat in 1815. For this reason, the division of the Ilocos into two provinces was recommended by the local authorities. On February 2, 1818, a Spanish Royal Decree was promulgated dividing the Province of Ilocos Norte from Ilocos Sur. Laoag, which was then the biggest center of population, was made the capital of Ilocos Norte."

Laoag was captured by the Japanese Army on December 12, 1941, two days after the landing at Vigan and Aparri. Its airport was then used by the Japanese for most of World War II.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On June 19, 1965, Laoag changed from municipality to city status, following a [[plebiscite]] and passed into law by the Senate President [[Ferdinand Edralin Marcos]]. It remained the capital of [[Ilocos Norte]]. Mayor Eulalio F. Siazon and Engineer Trinidad Lucas Aurelio were part of a team that led the drive to convert Laoag into a city. Another members of the group was Simeon M. Valdez who filed the bill in congress, co-authored by Antonio V. Raquiza. The first city mayor was Eulalio Fonacier Siazon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laoagcity.gov.ph/index.php/about-the-city/background/history/|title=History|publisher=City Government of Laoag|access-date=August 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075321/http://laoagcity.gov.ph/index.php/about-the-city/background/history/|archive-date=July 23, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
Laoag is located at the west-central part of the Province of [[Ilocos Norte]] bordering the [[South China Sea]].  It is bounded on the east by the Municipality of [[Sarrat]]; in the southeast by the Municipality of [[San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte|San Nicolas]]; in the southwest by the Municipality of [[Paoay]], in the northeast the Municipality of [[Vintar]]; in the northwest by the Municipality of [[Bacarra]]; and in the west by the [[South China Sea]]. It is one of the largest cities in the [[Ilocos Region]].<ref name="Geographical Location">{{cite web|url=http://laoagcity.gov.ph/index.php/about-the-city/background/geographical-location/|title=Geographical Location|publisher=City Government of Laoag|access-date=August 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011020942/http://laoagcity.gov.ph/index.php/about-the-city/background/geographical-location/|archive-date=October 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Barangays===
Laoag is politically subdivided into 80 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

[[Tourism in the Philippines|Tourism]] has become a major economic driver of Laoag City, paving the way for new commercial investments and infrastructure development. Fort Ilocandia Resort, first and only 5-star hotel in the north, continues to attract foreign and domestic tourists. Other places of interest include a tour of heritage sites featuring Spanish colonial buildings, [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] churches, [[La Paz Sand Dunes]], white-sand beach resorts of [[Pagudpud]], and Marcos-era mansions.

The dramatic increase in tourist arrivals also prompted the establishment of a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] consulate to oversee the security of Chinese citizens living or visiting the city. A new immigration policy was  made to simplify entry of Chinese tourists into the country by issuing visitor visas at the airport upon arrival to entice more guests to come. Laoag City has been named as one of the top tourist destinations in [[Ilocos Region|Region I]] and in the country.
