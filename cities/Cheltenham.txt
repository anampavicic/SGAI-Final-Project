'''Cheltenham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|t|n|ə|m}}) is a [[spa town]] and borough on the edge of the [[Cotswolds]] in [[Gloucestershire]], England. Cheltenham became known as a health and holiday spa town resort following the discovery of mineral springs in 1716, and claims to be the most complete [[Regency era|Regency]] town in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitcheltenham.com/explore-the-area/regency-cheltenham#:~:text=Cheltenham%3A%20The%20UK's%20most%20complete%20Regency%20Town |title=Visit Cheltenham |publisher=visitcheltenham.com |access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref> It is directly northeast of [[Gloucester]].

The town hosts several cultural festivals, often featuring nationally and internationally famous contributors and attendees: the [[Cheltenham Literature Festival]], the [[Cheltenham Jazz Festival]], the [[Cheltenham Science Festival]], the [[Cheltenham Music Festival]], the Cheltenham International Film Festival, the [[Cheltenham Cricket Festival]] and the [[Cheltenham Food & Drink Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.garden-events.com/ |title=Welcome to Garden Events |publisher=Garden-events.com |date=17 June 2012 |access-date=4 February 2014 |archive-date=3 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603133415/https://garden-events.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheltenhamfestivals.com/ |title=Jazz, Science, Music & Literature |publisher=Cheltenham Festivals |access-date=8 November 2012}}</ref> In [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] horse racing, the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] is the main event of the [[Cheltenham Festival]] held every March.

==History==
[[File:Cheltenhammap 1933.jpg|thumb|left|Cheltenham in 1933]]
Cheltenham stands on [[River Chelt]], which rises nearby at [[Dowdeswell]] and runs through the town on its way to the [[River Severn|Severn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50869 |title=Chedgrave – Cheltenham &#124; A Topographical Dictionary of England (pp. 562–569) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=22 June 2003 |access-date=4 February 2014}}</ref> It was first recorded in 803, as ''Celtan hom''; the meaning has not been resolved with certainty, but latest scholarship concludes that the first element preserves a Celtic noun ''cilta'', 'steep hill', here referring to the Cotswold scarp; the second element may mean 'settlement' or 'water-meadow'.<ref>R Coates, English Place-Name Society ''Journal'' 16 (1983–84)</ref> As a royal manor, it features in the earliest pages of the [[Gloucestershire]] section of [[Domesday Book]]<ref>John Morris (ed.), ''Domesday Book, 15 Gloucestershire'' (1982) p162 {{ISBN|0850333210}}</ref> where it is named ''Chintenha[m]''. The town was awarded a market charter in 1226.

Though little remains of its pre-spa history, Cheltenham has always been a health and holiday spa town resort since the discovery of [[mineral spring]]s there in 1716. Captain [[Henry Skillicorne]] (1678–1763), is credited with being the first entrepreneur to recognise the opportunity to exploit the mineral springs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Norman's History of Cheltenham|last = Goding|first = John|publisher = Longman|year = 1863|location = London|pages = 124–25}}</ref> The retired "master mariner" became co-owner of the property containing Cheltenham's first mineral spring upon his 1732<ref>at Long Ashton, Somerset on 4 January; note in family bible</ref> marriage to Elizabeth Mason.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = The English Spa, 1560–1815: A Social History|last = Hembry|first = Phyllis May|publisher = Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year = 1900|isbn = 978-0838633915|location = Madison, New Jersey|page = 179}}</ref> Her father, William Mason, had done little in his lifetime to promote the healing properties of the mineral water apart from limited advertising and building a small enclosure over the spring.<ref name=":0" /> Skillicorne's wide travels as a merchant had prepared him to see the potential lying dormant on this inherited property. After moving to Cheltenham in 1738, he immediately began improvements intended to attract visitors to his spa. He built a pump to regulate the flow of water and erected an elaborate well-house complete with a ballroom and upstairs billiard room to entertain his customers. The beginnings of Cheltenham's tree-lined promenades and the gardens surrounding its spas were first designed by Captain Skillicorne with the help of "wealthy and traveled" friends who understood the value of relaxing avenues. The area's walks and gardens had views of the countryside, and soon the gentry and nobility from across the county were enticed to come and investigate the beneficial waters of Cheltenham's market town spa.<ref name=":1" />

The visit of [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] with the queen and royal princesses in 1788 set a stamp of fashion on the spa.<ref>Lewis 1848.</ref> The spa waters can still be sampled at the [[Pittville Pump Room]], built for this purpose and completed in 1830;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/interactive/interactive_map/cheltenham/pitville.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215144940/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/interactive/interactive_map/cheltenham/pitville.shtml |archive-date=15 December 2008|title=One of Cheltenham's finest – the Pittville Pump Room }}</ref> it is a centrepiece of [[Pittville]], a planned extension of Cheltenham to the north, undertaken by [[Joseph Pitt]], who laid the first stone 4 May 1825.<ref>Lewis, 1848.</ref>

Cheltenham's success as a spa town is reflected in the railway station, which is still called [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham Spa]], and spa facilities in other towns that were inspired by or named after it.<ref>For example, the Cheltenham Baths at [[Ossett#Spa]], see [http://www.larkshill.org.uk/ossett_spa.html History of Ossett Spa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121050738/http://www.larkshill.org.uk/ossett_spa.html |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref>

[[Alice Liddell]] and [[Lewis Carroll]] were regular visitors to a house in Cudnall Street, [[Charlton Kings]] – a suburb of Cheltenham. This house was owned by Alice Liddell's grandparents, and still contains the mirror, or looking glass, that was purportedly the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', published in 1871.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswolds.info/places/cheltenham.shtml|title=Cheltenham Tourist Information Guide|work=cotswolds.info}}</ref>

Horse racing began in Cheltenham in 1815, and became a major national attraction after the establishment of the [[Cheltenham Festival|Festival]] in 1902.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.cheltenhamfestival.net/subcategory/guide/history/ |publisher=Cheltenham Festival |access-date=26 October 2019}}</ref> The racecourse attracts tens of thousands of visitors to each day of the festival each year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingchronicle.com/blogger/2007/07/cheltenham-festival-attendance-figures.html|title=Sports News – Sporting Chronicle: Cheltenham Festival Attendance Figures 2005|publisher=Sporting Chronicle|access-date=4 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055447/http://www.sportingchronicle.com/blogger/2007/07/cheltenham-festival-attendance-figures.html|archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref> with such large numbers of visitors having a significant impact on the town.

In the [[Second World War]], the [[United States Army Services of Supply]], European Theatre of Operations established its primary headquarters at Cheltenham under the direction of [[John C. H. Lee|Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee]], with the flats of the Cheltenham Racecourse<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cheltenham.racecourse.arp.jpg|title=Cheltenham Racecourse|work=wikimedia.org|date=17 June 2006 }}</ref> becoming a giant storage depot for countless trucks, jeeps, tanks and artillery pieces. Most of this materiel was reshipped to the continent for and after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day invasion]]. Lee and his primary staff had offices and took residence at [[Thirlestaine Hall]] in Cheltenham.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thirlestaine Hall, Thirlestaine Road Concept Statement |url=http://www.cheltenham.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/2307/thirlestaine_hall_thirlestaine_road-concept_statement |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412075511/http://www.cheltenham.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/2307/thirlestaine_hall_thirlestaine_road-concept_statement |archive-date=12 April 2015 |access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref>

The first British jet aircraft prototype, the [[Gloster E.28/39]], was manufactured in Cheltenham. Manufacturing started in [[Hucclecote]] near Gloucester, but was later moved to Regent Motors in Cheltenham High Street (now the Regent Arcade), considered a location safer from bombing during the Second World War.

==Geography==
[[File:Panorama of Cheltenham.jpg|thumb|A view of Cheltenham from the hills]]
Cheltenham is on the edge of the [[Cotswolds]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] in the South-West region of England. The small [[River Chelt]] flows under and through the town.

[[Cleeve Hill, Gloucestershire|Cleeve Hill]], overlooks the town and is the highest point in the [[county]] of [[Gloucestershire]] and the Cotswold Hills range, at {{convert|1,083|ft|m}}.

The town is near the northeastern edge of the [[South West of England]] region being {{convert|88|mi|km}} west-northwest of London, {{convert|38|mi|km}} northeast of [[Bristol]] and {{convert|41|mi|km}} south of Birmingham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Cheltenham,+UK&toplace=London,+UK&dt1=ChIJqzQuUDgDcUgRIOD5QaW8Z9A&dt2=ChIJdd4hrwug2EcRmSrV3Vo6llI|title=Distance between Cheltenham, UK and London, UK (UK)|website=distancecalculator.globefeed.com}}</ref>

===Neighbourhoods===

The districts of Cheltenham include: [[Arle, Cheltenham|Arle]], [[Benhall, Cheltenham|Benhall]], [[Charlton Kings]], [[Fairview, Cheltenham|Fairview]], Fiddler's Green, [[Hesters Way]], [[Lansdown, Cheltenham|Lansdown]], [[Leckhampton]], Lynworth, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham|Montpellier]], Oakley, [[Pittville]], [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], the Reddings, [[Rowanfield]], St Luke's, St Mark's, [[St. Pauls, Cheltenham|St Paul's]], St Peter's, Springbank, [[Swindon Village]], Tivoli, [[Up Hatherley]], [[Whaddon, Cheltenham|Whaddon]] and [[Wyman's Brook]].

The borough contains three [[civil parish]]es within its boundaries. These are [[Charlton Kings]], [[Leckhampton with Warden Hill]] and [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]]. These all have their own [[parish council (England)|parish council]]s who handle local services and planning with elected councillors.

=== Green belt ===
{{further|Gloucester and Cheltenham Green Belt}}
Parts of the town has [[green belt]] along its fringes, and this extends into the surrounding Tewkesbury district, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned expansion towards Gloucester and Bishop's Cleeve, as well as protecting smaller villages in between. West of the Greenfield Way and Fiddlers Green Lane roads, along with much of the open space up to the Civil Service Sports Ground, as well as the Cheltenham Racecourse and surrounding green park, along with St Peter Leckhampton parish church and Brizen Playing Fields/Haven and Greenmead parks along the south of the borough, are covered.

== Potential merger of Cheltenham and Gloucester ==
In May 2024, under plans by [[Gloucestershire County Council]], it was reported that there are secret talks to formally merge the conurbations of Cheltenham and Gloucester with each other.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garcia |first1=Carmelo |date=11 May 2024 |title=Secret plans to 'merge Cheltenham with Gloucester' and create garden towns |url=https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/secret-plans-merge-gloucester-cheltenham-9276608 |access-date=19 July 2024 |work=Gloucestershire Live |language=en}}</ref> The plans suggest that around ten new [[garden towns]] could be built around the green belt at [[Boddington, Gloucestershire|Boddington]] which if removed would result in the complete merger of both boroughs. Doing so would facilitate and effectively merge the two into a [[supercity]].<ref>{{cite web |date=10 July 2024 |title=Cheltenham and Gloucester councilors are said to be opposing any move towards a 'super city' in the green belt – uwfinance |url=https://www.uwfinance.ca/g00d/8dcea63080P34fdd54/ |access-date=19 July 2024}}</ref> The move has been criticised by both [[Cheltenham Borough Council]] and [[Gloucester City Council]].<ref>{{cite news |date=9 July 2024 |title=Cheltenham and Gloucester council chiefs would oppose any move for 'supercity' on green belt |url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/cheltenham-gloucester-council-chiefs-oppose-132946076.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAFKtdjlJL1-2cZdiWp6KZ1QXPyz8-AM680-AsR1AUv6kUPRitCQsbC7z-qKkZG9k2JNSc5R0YJcBDCNjZxEdLk63B85GrhqudH2yNNhSLKbiOAcFvyQzPkT0ktMtD1Zvx2hVXzSBma3ybPgtidB12I2sUTmLm2GyFRCJJkyUuvD |access-date=19 July 2024 |work=Yahoo News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=16 May 2024 |title=Build 140k homes could 'merge' Gloucester and Cheltenham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c25rr4d218zo#:~:text=Plans%20to%20%27merge%27%20districts%20could%20create%20140k%20homes&text=The%20draft%20also%20proposes%20removing,largely%20undeveloped%20or%20agricultural%20land. |access-date=19 July 2024 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

==Government==
{{main|Cheltenham Borough Council}}

Cheltenham Borough Council is the local authority for Cheltenham; it is split into 20 wards, with a total of 40 councillors elected to serve on the borough council. Since 2002, elections have been held every two years with half of the councillors elected at each election.

===Administrative history===
Cheltenham was an [[ancient parish]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cheltenham Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10366458 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=27 August 2023}}</ref> Until 1786 it was administered by its [[vestry]], in the same way as most rural areas. The vestry was supplemented by a body of unelected [[improvement commissioners]] in 1786 known as the Paving and Lighting Commission, initially charged with paving, lighting and repairing the streets, which later gained other powers including providing a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watch]] and setting standards for new buildings. The commissioners were reformed in 1852 to be partly-elected and were eventually replaced in 1876 when the town was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cheltenham Borough Records |url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/98121c17-9055-4d99-9ec5-dbdb11170ee9 |website=The National Archives |access-date=27 August 2023}}</ref>

On 1 April 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the borough of Cheltenham was merged with [[Charlton Kings]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] to form the [[non-metropolitan district]] of Cheltenham. Four parishes—[[Swindon Village]], [[Up Hatherley]], [[Leckhampton]] and [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]]—were added to the borough of Cheltenham from the borough of [[Tewkesbury (borough)|Tewkesbury]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1991/Uksi_19910281_en_1.htm |title=The Gloucestershire (District Boundaries) Order 1991 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |access-date=4 February 2014}}</ref>

===GCHQ===

[[File:Aerial of GCHQ, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England 24May2017 arp.jpg|thumb|Government Communications Headquarters' head office (2017)]]

The head office of the British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), known to locals as ''[[The Doughnut]]'', is located in Cheltenham, to which it moved in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/about/moving5.html|title=History of GCHQ Cheltenham|work=GCHQ website 'About Us' pages|access-date=29 June 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061005175413/http://www.gchq.gov.uk/about/moving5.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 5 October 2006}}</ref>

==Climate==
As with the vast majority of the [[British Isles]], Cheltenham experiences a temperate [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). It has warm summers and cool winters. The town held the British maximum temperature record from 1990 to 2003—temperatures reached {{convert|98.8|F|C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/interesting/aug1990/ |title=Hot spell August 1990 |publisher=Met Office |access-date=4 February 2014}}</ref> The absolute minimum is {{convert|-4.2|F|C}}, set during December 1981. During a typical year, 145.6 days will report at least 1&nbsp;mm of rain, and some 42.2 nights will record air frost.

===Cheltenham Festival===
{{main|Cheltenham Festival}}
Cheltenham Festival is a significant [[National Hunt racing]] meeting,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/66009.stm |title=Going is good for Cheltenham |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=17 March 1998 |access-date=10 March 2009}}</ref> and has race prize money second only to the [[Grand National]]. It is an event where many of the best British and Irish trained horses race against each other, the extent of which is relatively rare during the rest of the season.

The festival takes place annually in March at [[Cheltenham Racecourse]]. The meeting is often very popular with Irish visitors,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/sport/horse-racing/cheltenham-festival-gets-underway-this-afternoon-14219806.html |title=Cheltenham festival gets underway this afternoon |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |date=10 March 2009 |access-date=10 March 2009}}</ref> mostly because of that nation's affinity with horse racing, but also because it usually coincides with [[St. Patrick's Day]], a national holiday in celebration of the [[patron saint]] of [[Ireland]].

Large amounts of money are bet during festival week, with hundreds of millions of [[pound Sterling|pounds]] being gambled over the four days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/Cheltenham-Festival-2015-numbers-150million-bets/story-26172465-detail/story.html|title=Cheltenham Festival 2015 in numbers: £150million in bets, 10,745 bottles of champagne and 250 chefs|work=Gloucestershire Echo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705013128/http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/Cheltenham-Festival-2015-numbers-150million-bets/story-26172465-detail/story.html|archive-date=5 July 2015}}</ref> Cheltenham is often noted for its atmosphere, most notably the "Cheltenham roar", which refers to the enormous amount of noise that the crowd generates as the starter raises the tape for the first race of the festival.

==Transport==
===Railways===
[[File:Cheltenham Spa Railway Station.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance of Cheltenham Spa station]]
[[Cheltenham Spa railway station]] is a stop on the [[Cross Country Route|Bristol-Birmingham main line]]. It is located to the west of the [[Montpellier, Cheltenham|Montpellier]] area of the town and is known locally as ''Lansdown''.

The station is served by three [[train operating companies]]:
* [[CrossCountry]] operates long-distance services between the [[South West England|South West]], [[South Wales]], the [[Midlands]], the [[North West England|North West]], the [[North East England|North East]] and [[Scotland]].<ref> {{Cite web |work=CrossCountry |title=Timetables |date=10 December 2023 |access-date=11 December 2023 |url= https://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/travel-updates-information/train-timetables |quote=}}</ref>
* [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] connects the town with {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}}, {{rws|Worcester Foregate Street}}, {{rws|Gloucester}}, {{rws|Swindon}} and [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]].<ref> {{Cite web |work=Great Western Railway |title=Train Times |date=10 December 2023 |access-date=11 December 2023 |url= https://www.gwr.com/travel-information/train-times |quote=}}</ref> 
* [[Transport for Wales]] operates services between Cheltenham Spa and South Wales, usually running through to Maesteg via Gloucester, Chepstow, Newport, Cardiff Central and Bridgend.

The ''[[Cheltenham Spa Express]]'', once known as the ''Cheltenham Flyer'', is a [[List of named passenger trains of the United Kingdom|named passenger train]] connecting Cheltenham with London. The former Cheltenham Flyer was, for a time, the fastest passenger train in scheduled service in the world.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df_N0gJhKI8 | title='The World's fastest train'... The Cheltenham Flyer 1931 | website=[[YouTube]] | date=29 April 2021 }}</ref> 

At its peak, the town had eight railway stations,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/history/forgotten-railway-stations-gloucestershire-7470012 | title=The forgotten railway stations of Gloucestershire | date=21 August 2022 }}</ref> only one of which survives. It is a matter of local controversy that trains are not run directly to London but instead via Gloucester; although routes do exist for a direct and therefore much faster service, as demonstrated during 2023 when a bridge closure in Oxfordshire led to some services to Hereford stopping at Cheltenham.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/cotswolds-rail-passengers-face-long-8369834 | title=Closure of key Cotswold bridge used by 240 trains a day | date=20 April 2023 }}</ref>

[[File:Cheltenham racecourse.JPG|thumb|Cheltenham Racecourse station platforms]]
The restored [[Cheltenham Racecourse railway station]] is the southern terminus of the [[heritage railway|heritage]] [[Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway]]. The [[Honeybourne Line]] was extended northwards to [[Broadway railway station|Broadway]] in 2018,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gwsr.com/Opening_to_Broadway__30_March_to_2_April_2018--post--45.html |title=Opening to Broadway - 30 March to 2 April 2018 |access-date=2 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701030800/https://www.gwsr.com/Opening_to_Broadway__30_March_to_2_April_2018--post--45.html |archive-date=1 July 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with an aspiration to extend the line southwards to Cheltenham Spa where the line originally branched off from the Bristol to Birmingham main line.

===Roads===
Cheltenham is adjacent to the [[M5 motorway]], between Bristol and Birmingham. Junction 10 serves the north of the town, via the A4019; junction 11 links to the south, via the [[A40 road|A40]] which continues towards [[Oxford]] and London.

===Buses and coaches===
[[Stagecoach West]] operate the majority of bus services in Cheltenham, including routes to [[Gloucester]] and [[Tewkesbury]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stops in Cheltenham |work=Bus Times |date=2023 |access-date=11 December 2023 |url= https://bustimes.org/localities/cheltenham-gloucs |quote=}}</ref>

[[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates a number of coach services from Cheltenham including route 444 to London and [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]]. Before becoming part of National Express, Cheltenham was a major hub for ''Black and White Coaches'', with routes throughout the country, many of which formed a mass exodus through the town at 14:30 each day.

===Tramroad===
Cheltenham was a terminus of the [[Gloucester and Cheltenham Tramroad]].

==Churches==
{{main|List of churches in Cheltenham}}

The first [[parish church]] is [[Cheltenham Minster, St Mary's]], which is the only surviving medieval building in the town. As a result of expansion of the population, absorption of surrounding villages, and the efforts of both evangelical and Anglo-Catholic missions, the town has a large number of other parish churches,<ref>{{cite web |title=Cheltenham |url=https://www.findachurch.co.uk/search/?address=Cheltenham |publisher=Find a Church |access-date=26 October 2019}}</ref> including [[Trinity Cheltenham|Trinity Church]] and All Saints', [[Pittville]], where the composer [[Gustav Holst]]'s father was the organist.

[[St Gregory's Church, Cheltenham|St Gregory's]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church is an example of the work of the architect [[Charles Francis Hansom|Charles Hansom]].<ref name=Verey128>{{cite book |last=Verey |first=David |series=[[The Buildings of England]] |title=Gloucestershire: The Vale and the Forest of Dean |volume=2 |year=1970 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth |page=128}}</ref> The [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] building was built 1854–57, the porch was added in 1859, the tower and spire were completed in 1861 and the [[nave]] was extended to join the tower in 1877.<ref name=Verey128/> The church's [[stained glass]] is by [[Hardman & Co.]]<ref name=Verey128/>

===Bell ringing===
The town has three rings of bells hung for [[change ringing]]. One is located in St Mark's Church - a ring of 8 bells, with the heaviest being some 16cwt. These were originally a ring of 5 bells cast at John Taylor of Loughborough in 1885, extensively overhauled and augmented in 8 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarkschelt.co.uk/|title=St Mark's Church}}</ref> Another is at [[St Christopher's - Warden Hill|St. Christopher's (Warden Hill)]], the lightest ring of church bells in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tciwh.org.uk/index.php?page=bell_ringers#bell_ringers_general |title=St. Christopher's Church |publisher=Tciwh.org.uk |date=13 July 2001 |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> The other is a ring of 12 bells hung in [[Cheltenham Minster, St Mary's|St. Mary's Church]] (the Minster). These were the venue in 2008 for the eliminators of the National 12 Bell Striking contest, in which teams of [[Campanology|campanologists]] from around the world compete to win the Taylor Trophy. In 2017 the old ring of 12 was completely replaced with [http://www.cheltminsterbells.org.uk/ new bells] cast by [[John Taylor & Co]]. The tenor bell is just over a ton in weight, and the new ring also includes a thirteenth bell, a sharp 2nd, to provide a lighter 8. The towers in the locality of Cheltenham belong to the Cheltenham branch of the Gloucester & Bristol Diocesan Association of Church Bell Ringers.
