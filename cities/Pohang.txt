'''Pohang''' ({{Korean|hangul=포항}}; {{IPA|ko|pʰo.ɦaŋ}}), formerly spelled '''Po-Hang''', is the largest city in  [[North Gyeongsang Province]], South Korea, with a [[List of cities in South Korea|population]] of 499,363 as of 2022, bordering the [[Sea of Japan]] to the east, Yeongcheon to the west, Gyeongju to the south, and Cheongsong and Yeongdeok to the north.

The city has food, textile, and metal industries. Agricultural products such as grapes, persimmons and garlic chives are abundant, and the city's proximity to the [[Sea of Japan]] has led to the development of a fishing industry. [[Hagfish]] is a local specialty.

The Korean Marine Corps 1st Division is stationed in Pohang, and their Education and Training Command is located there as well.

Tourist attractions include the Jukdo Fish Market, where fresh seafood is sold, as well as the Yeongildae Beach, Wolpo Beach, and Pohang Songdo Beach. Naejangsan Mountain divides Pohang and Yeongdeok and has twelve waterfalls.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ko:포항12경 |trans-title=12 Views of Pohang |url=https://www.pohang.go.kr/phtour/wmap/tourInformation/index.do?menu_idx=45&representative_views=true |access-date=2023-04-21 |website=www.pohang.go.kr |language=ko}}</ref>

==History==
{{prose|section|date=February 2019}}
The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Pohang area is from the [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (1500–300 BC). Archaeologists have unearthed small villages and megalithic burials ([[dolmen]]) from this period. Still a small fishing village at the dawn of the 20th century, the earliest steps toward developing Pohang into a place of greater significance were taken in 1930 with the construction of a modern harbour. Pohang grew rapidly afterward, attaining the designation of town ([[Eup (administrative division)|''eup'']]) in 1931 and then earning the status of city ([[List of cities in South Korea|''si'']]) in 1949.<ref name="worldportsource.com">[http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/KOR_Port_of_Pohang_1487.php WPS - Port of Pohang contact information]. Worldportsource.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref>

Pohang's road arteries and shipping port made it a place of strategic significance during the [[Korean War]]. An unopposed landing of UN forces at Pohang on July 18, 1950 was the first large-scale amphibious operation since World War II, and the region around Pohang saw [[Battle of P'ohang-dong|fierce clashes]] between South Korea's [[3rd Infantry Division (South Korea)|3rd Infantry Division]] and North Korea's [[5th Division (North Korea)|5th Infantry Division]] during August–September 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/07/116_43998.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802234605/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/07/116_43998.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-02 |script-title=ko:페이지를 찾을 수 없습니다 |publisher=Archive.is |date=2012-08-02 |access-date=2018-09-01}}</ref>

By the 1960s, Pohang was a small coastal city with a population of 50,000.<ref>[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~kocsea/pohang.htm KASTN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604164606/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~kocsea/pohang.htm |date=2011-06-04 }}. Cs.virginia.edu (1996-02-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref> The next major development in Pohang's growth came in 1968 with the inauguration of the steel maker [[POSCO]], and the local plant's commencement of production in 1972. The introduction of [[heavy industry]] to the city brought the local economy to a blend of iron, steel, shipbuilding and fisheries through the end of the 20th century.<ref name="worldportsource.com"/>

The early 21st century and the age of [[globalization]] has brought new economic challenges to companies such as POSCO, giving rise to beliefs that Pohang would be wise to not be overly reliant on heavy industry to maintain its prosperity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esri.handong.edu/korean/download.php?id=209&sid=8e8361e216e22553cc306b08f4598736 |script-title=ko:자동등록방지를 위해 보안절차를 거치고 있습니다 |publisher=Esri.handong.edu |access-date=2018-09-01 |archive-date=2018-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901145611/http://esri.handong.edu/korean/download.php?id=209&sid=8e8361e216e22553cc306b08f4598736 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In response, the Pohang of today presents itself as having an eye to the future, striving to become a diversified city of [[environmentalism]] and advanced learning, as well as a centre of arts and culture.<ref>[http://eng.ipohang.org/En/About/AP01/?navi=AP01_1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901131644/http://eng.ipohang.org/En/About/AP01/?navi=AP01_1|date=September 1, 2009}}</ref>

During the [[Silla]] Dynasty the area was made up of four ''[[hyeon]]'', Toehwa-hyeon ({{Korean|labels=no|퇴화현|退火縣}}), Jidap-hyeon ({{Korean|labels=no|지답현|只沓縣}}), Geunoji-hyeon ({{Korean|labels=no|근오지현|斤烏支縣}}), Haea-hyeon ({{Korean|labels=no|해아현|海阿縣}}). Then during the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty these four were renamed to Heunghae-[[Administrative divisions of South Korea|gun]] (흥해군/{{lang|ko|興海郡}}), Janggi-hyeon ({{Korean|labels=no|장기현|長鬐縣}}), Yeongil-hyeon ({{Korean|labels=no|영일현|迎日縣}}), Cheongha-hyeon ({{Korean|labels=no|청하현|淸河縣}}) respectively.

On 4 August 1896, the three remaining ''hyeon'', which at that time were Janggi, Yeonil ({{Korean|labels=no|연일|延日}}; originally Yeongil) and Cheongha were reassigned as counties or ''[[Administrative divisions of South Korea|gun]]'' as part of the change to the 13-province division of the [[Korean Empire]].

On 1 March 1914, the four counties were unified as one Yeongil-gun ({{Korean|labels=no|영일군|迎日郡}}), which was subdivided into 18 ''[[Myeon (administrative division)|myeons]]''.

On 1 April 1931, Pohang-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|포항면|浦項面}}) was designated as an ''[[Eup (administrative division)|eup]]'', thus giving Yeongil-gun 1 eup and 17 myeon.

On 1 April 1934, Jukbuk-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|죽북면|竹北面}}) and Juknam-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|죽남면|竹南面}}) were united to make Jukjang-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|죽장면|竹長面}}), while Janggi-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|장기면|長鬐面}}) and Bongsan-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|봉산면|峰山面}}) united to make Jihaeng-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|지행면|只杏面}}), so that there were 1 eup and 15 myeon.

On 1 October 1938, Hyeongsan-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|형산면|兄山面}}) was incorporated into Pohang-eup, leaving Yeongil-gun with 1 eup and 14 myeon.

On 1 October 1942 Changju-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|창주면|滄洲面}}) was renamed and reclassified as Guryongpo-eup (구룡포읍/九龍浦邑), leaving 2 eup and 13 myeon.

On 15 August 1949, Pohang-eup was designated as Pohang-[[List of cities in South Korea|''si'']] ({{Korean|labels=no|포항시|浦項市}}), leaving Yeongil with 1 si, 1 eup, 13 myeon and 1 local office.

On 8 July 1956, Heunghae-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|흥해면|興海面}}) and Gokgang-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|곡강면|曲江面}})  are incorporated into Uichang-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|의창면|義昌面}}) leaving 1 si, 1 eup and 12 myeon.

On 29 October 1957, Daljeon-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|달전면|達田面}}) is abolished and incorporated into Heunghae-myeon and Yeonil-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|연일면|延日面}}) leaving 1 si, 1 eup and 11 myeons.

On 1 March 1967, the Gibuk Local Office ({{Korean|labels=no|기북출장소|杞北出張所}}) of Gigye-myeon (기계면/{{lang|ko|杞溪面}}) is established.

On 1 July 1973, Uichang-myeon is designated as Uichang-eup ({{Korean|labels=no|의창읍|義昌邑}}) leaving 1 si, 2 eup, 10 myeon and 3 local offices.

On 1 December 1980, Yeonil-myeon and Ocheon-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|오천면|烏川面}}) are both designated as eup leaving 1 si, 4 eup, 8 myeon and 3 local offices.

On 1 September 1982, Haedo-dong ({{Korean|labels=no|해도동|海島洞}}) and Sangdae-dong ({{Korean|labels=no|상대동|上大洞}}) are separated into Haedo 1 and 2-dong and Sangdae 1 and 2-dong respectively.

On 1 April 1986, Daebo Local Office ({{Korean|labels=no|대보출장소|大甫出張所}}) and Gibuk Local Office are designated as myeon leaving 1 si, 4 eup, 10 myeon and 1 local office.

On 1 January 1995, a united Pohang absorbs all of Yeongil-gun, composed of 1 si, 2 gu, 4 eup, 10 myeon, 25 dong and 1 local office.

On 1 September 1998, the unification of Small-dong left Pohang with 1 si, 2 gu, 4 eup, 10 myeon, 19 dong and 1 local office.

On 1 January 2009, the unification of Small-dong left Pohang with 1 si, 2 gu, 4 eup, 10 myeon, 15 dong and 1 local office.

==Transportation==
The city is served by several trains a day from [[Seoul]] and [[Daegu]]. Pohang is the terminus for a number of ferry routes serving the adjacent Sea of Japan, including the main tourist route for [[Ulleung Island]] and [[Liancourt Rocks]]. 
Pohang is the home of [[POSCO]] (the Pohang Steel Company), one of the largest steel producers in the world, and a host of related industries. As a result, the port shipped a total of 54.8 million tons in 2006.<ref>[http://eng.ipohang.org/En/Business/BU01/?navi=BU01_1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501160334/http://eng.ipohang.org/En/Business/BU01/?navi=BU01_1|date=May 1, 2009}}</ref>

Several flights per day to Seoul [[Gimpo Airport]] and [[Jeju Airport]] are available at [[Pohang Airport|Pohang Gyeongju Airport]].

Local transportation is served by only city buses. They run about 20 different ways of the city and some of them reach to the mountain folk. Also, the buses are classified into 2 kinds – one is Ilban-bus (normal bus) and the other is Jwaseok-bus (full of seats and a little more expensive than Ilban-bus). They run 15~25 minutes intervals along their own way. The bus routes are listed in both [http://bis.ipohang.org/Guide/LineGuide/# Korean] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612154911/http://bis.ipohang.org/Guide/LineGuide |date=2011-06-12 }} and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091216001813/http://eng.ipohang.org/home/eng/travelers_Info/page.wscms English] but the Korean version is interactive, and thus more helpful.

There are two main bus terminals - Shiwae ({{Korean|hangul=시외|labels=no}}) and Gosok ({{Korean|hangul=고속|labels=no}}) which roughly translate into intercity/city and express. The Shiwae bus terminal ({{Korean|hangul=시외버스터미널|labels=no}}) also acts as the cross-country bus terminal from which access to nearby metropolitan cities such as Daegu and Busan (~1.5 hrs each depending on traffic) is available. Their [http://포항터미날.kr/main/main.asp website] is only in Korean and only accessible in Internet Explorer. The Gosok bus terminal ({{Korean|hangul=고속버스터미널|labels=no}}) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070212052546/http://www.kobus.co.kr/web/eng/index.jsp website] is in both English and Korean.  From Gosok bus terminal one can travel to Seoul and Gwangju.

Pohang is also serviced by two train stations - [[Pohang station]] ({{Korean|hangul=포항역|labels=no}}) and Wolpo station ({{Korean|hangul=월포역|labels=no}}). Times and destinations are available on the [http://info.korail.com/2018/eng/eng_index.jsp Korail website] which is in English and Korean.

Passengers using the [[KTX]] had to go to [[Gyeongju station]] ({{Korean|hangul=경주역|labels=no}}) until 2015. However, since 2015, the [[KTX]] travels directly to [[Pohang station]] ({{Korean|hangul=포항역|labels=no}}).

There are some hospitals to treat people; two types of hospitals exist: public, and private. Public hospitals are run by the government, and supported by the government. Conversely, private hospitals are managed by the individuals. For example, S Pohang hospital is sponsored by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security which means it is supported by the government ("Introduction of the hospital" 1). They provide the treatments of brain disease, and spine disease. For private hospital, Pohang Sunlin Hospital is run by Hyunsu Shin ("Introduction of the head of the hospital" 1).

The beach is also home to the 'Hands of Harmony' sculpture.

Bogyeongsa is a major [[Buddhist temple]] nestled in a steep green valley at the foot of Mount Naeyeon (710 m) in Songna-myeon, an area in the extreme northern part of Pohang. Yeonsan Waterfall is located nearby in the same mountain valley. There are hiking trails leading from the temple up into the mountains. Bogyeongsa also has a number of mountain hermitages in the vicinity.

Oeosa is a temple located in the extreme southern part of Pohang, just inside the mountains south of the coastal plain formed by the Naengcheon River. It is located at the foot of Mt. Unjae (481 m) in a steep valley in Daesong-myeon. Signs placed in and around Oeosa claim that the temple was founded by [[Wonhyo]], the well-travelled [[Silla]] monk.
