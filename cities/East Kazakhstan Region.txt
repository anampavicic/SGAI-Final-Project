'''East Kazakhstan Region''' ({{langx|kk|Шығыс Қазақстан облысы|translit=Şyğys Qazaqstan oblysy}}; {{langx|ru|Восточно-Казахстанская область|Vostochno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast}}) is a [[Regions of Kazakhstan|region]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. It occupies the easternmost part of Kazakhstan, and includes parts of the [[Irtysh River]], [[Lake Markakol]], and [[Lake Zaysan]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2017|title=East Kazakhstan Region|url=http://primeminister.kz/enpage/article-88|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307212418/http://primeminister.kz/enpage/article-88|archive-date=2017-03-07|access-date=2020-08-14|publisher=The Office of the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan|language=en}}</ref> Its administrative center is [[Öskemen]] (also known as Ust'-Kamenogorsk).<ref name=":0" /> The region borders Altai Krai and Altai republic in [[Russia]] in the north and northeast and the [[China|People's Republic of China]], via [[Xinjiang]], in the south and southeast. The easternmost point of the Oblast is within about 50 kilometres of the westernmost tip of [[Mongolia]];{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} however, Kazakhstan and Mongolia do not share a common border, the two countries being separated by a small part of Russia and China.

The region was created by the merger of two Soviet-era Kazakhstan [[oblast]]s: the old Vostochno-Kazakhstanskaya (East Kazakhstan) Oblast and [[Semipalatinsk Oblast, Kazakhstan|Semipalatinsk Oblast]]. On 17 March 2022, it was announced that East Kazakhstan region would be divided, creating the [[Abai Region]]. This came into force on 8 June 2022, with eight districts of East Kazakhstan Region being transferred to the new region. The new border dividing Abai Region and East Kazakhstan region roughly corresponds to the border that existed between the two Soviet-era Oblasts.

==Geography==
East Kazakhstan Region borders [[Abai Region]] to the west, Russia's [[Altai Krai]] and [[Altai Republic]] to the north and China's [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] to the south and east.<ref name=":0" />

The region occupies a very diverse range of geographic and climatic regions with the [[Altai Mountains]] in the east and the eastern margins of the [[Kazakh Steppe]] in the west of the region.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}
