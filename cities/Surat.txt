=== Etymology ===
The traditional account is that Surat was built up by a wealthy Hindu merchant named Gopi around the year 1500. At first, the town had no name and was simply called "the new place". Gopi consulted with astrologers, who suggested the name "Suraj", or "Suryapur", or "city of the sun". Gopi sent a request to the unnamed king of Gujarat for this to be the new town's name. The Muslim king altered it to ''Surat'' after the word ''[[surah]]'', which is the name of the chapters of the [[Qur'an]]. However, the names Suryapur and Surat are both mentioned in sources before 1500, so both the name and the town predate Gopi's time.<ref name="Gazetteer 1962">{{cite book |last1=Palande |first1=M.R. |title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Surat District |date=1962 |publisher=Directorate of Government Printing, Stationery, and Publications |location=Ahmedabad |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ministry.08210 |access-date=2 May 2023}}</ref>{{rp|82–4}}

[[Duarte Barbosa]] described Surat as Suratt. Jacob Peeters referred to Surat as Sourratte which is a Dutch name.<ref>{{cite web |title=PEETERS, Jacob.

===Surat before the Mughal Empire===
Before the rise of Surat in the 1500s, the nearby town of [[Rander]] was the main commercial centre in the area. Rander had a prominent Arab merchant community involved in overseas trade with regions such as Burma, China, Malaya, and Sumatra. In the 1500s, Rander declined due to Portuguese raids. Surat became an important port city around the same time, and some of Rander's merchant population likely moved to Surat for economic opportunity.<ref name="Gazetteer 1962"/>{{rp|82–3}}

Early references to Surat appear by the 10th century, but they shed little light on what type of settlement it was. As Suryapur, it is mentioned along with Bharuch as a place where an army from [[Patan, Gujarat|Anhilwara]] passed through in 990 en route to attack the ruler of [[Lata (region)|Lata]]. Suryapur may also be the port called "Surabaya" mentioned by the 10th-century Arabic geographer [[Istakhri]] as being four days south of [[Khambhat]] and five days north of [[Sanjan, Gujarat|Sanjan]]. Other Arabic authors spelled the name as "Subara" or "Sufara". The identification of this place with Surat, though, is uncertain, and in any case these early mentions of Suryapur or Surabaya do not indicate whether it was a sizeable town or just a small hamlet.<ref name="Gazetteer 1962"/>{{rp|82–3}}

Another early mention of Surat is in the 1190s, after [[Qutb ud-Din Aibak]], then a general of [[Muhammad of Ghor|Muhammad Ghuri]], defeated the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] king [[Bhima II]] in battle. According to the local histories of Bakshi Mian Walad Shah Ahmad and Munshi Ghulam [[Mohyeddin|Mohi ud-Din]], Aibak went as far south as Rander and Surat. Surat was then ruled by a Hindu chief based at nearby [[Kamrej]]. This ruler initially tried to take refuge in a garden at Surat, but then decided that he had no chance of resisting Aibak's forces and offered his submission. Aibak, in turn, confirmed him as ruler of Kamrej.<ref name="Gazetteer 1962"/>{{rp|82–3}}

From 1297, Gujarat was gradually conquered by [[Allauddin Khilji]], the ruler of the principal state in north India at the time, the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. The Delhi Sultanate appointed Governors to control Gujarat, but this had to be forcefully imposed, notably in 1347, when [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] sacked Surat, among other cities.{{sfn|Campbell|1896}} [[Firoz Shah Tughlaq]] later built a fort at Surat in 1373. According to Bakshi Mian's account, when [[Muzaffar Shah I|Zafar Khan]] was appointed governor of Gujarat in 1391, he appointed his son Masti Khan to govern Rander and Surat, but Bakshi Mian adds that Surat was not very populous at this point.<ref name="Gazetteer 1962"/>{{rp|82–3}}

As control from the Delhi Sultanate waned at the end of the 14th century, pressure grew for an independent Gujarat, culminating in Zafar Khan declaring independence in 1407. Surat was controlled directly by the nobles of the Rajput kingdom of [[Baglana]] who fell either under the Gujarat Sultans or the [[Deccan sultanates]]. However, following the fall of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1538 it was controlled by more local nobles starting with Chengiz Khan who enjoyed absolute authority over Surat, [[Bharuch|Broach]], [[Baroda]] and [[Champaner]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44147187 |author=Arshia Shafqat |title=Pre-Annexation Sultanate: Administration Under Gujarat Sultans |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |year=2008 |volume=69 |pages=251–264 |jstor=44147187 |access-date=16 July 2021 |url-status=live |archive-date=16 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210716163501/https://www.jstor.org/stable/44147187}}</ref> However, in 1637, [[Aurangzeb]] fully annexed Baglana into the Mughal Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://amp.ww.en.freejournal.org/37160111/1/baglana.html |title=Baglana - mughal empire |website=amp.ww.en.freejournal.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210716163501/https://amp.ww.en.freejournal.org/37160111/1/baglana.html |archive-date=2021-07-16}}</ref>

In 1514, the Portuguese traveler [[Duarte Barbosa]] described Surat as an important seaport, frequented by many [[ship]]s from [[Zamorin|Malabar]] and various parts of the world. By 1520, the name of the city had become Surat. It was burned by the Portuguese (1512 and 1530), conquered by the Mughals (1573) and was twice raided by the Maratha king [[Shivaji]] (17th century).<ref name="EB">{{cite web |date=6 August 2014 |title=Surat |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Surat |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110000241/https://www.britannica.com/place/Surat |archive-date=10 January 2018 |access-date=9 January 2018 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.}}</ref> Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] placed major importance on Gujarat and successfully obtained numerous towns in Gujarat. The Mughals were able to conquer Surat due to his campaigns against Gujarat during his rule. In the 1570s, he launched two major [[Mughal conquest of Gujarat|campaigns against Gujarat]]—one of a much longer duration and one much shorter. The fall of Surat occurred during the former campaign and lasted one month and seventeen days.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44143369 |author=Zaman, M.K. |title=AKBAR'S GUJARAT CAMPAIGNS — A MILITARY ANALYSIS. |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |year=1994 |volume=55 |pages=313–318 |jstor=44143369 |access-date=26 November 2023}}</ref> Akbar implemented large military power during these conquests, fighting many battles. Notably, the conquest of Surat was an important catalyst for overseas trade during the rule of the Mughal Empire as it became the most important port city of that reign and evolved into a bustling trading hub.

===During the Mughal Empire===
It was the most prosperous port in the Mughal empire.<ref name="Eraly07">{{cite book |author1=Abraham Eraly |author-link1=Abraham Eraly |title=The Mughal World: Life in India's Last Golden Age |date=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0143102625 |pages=13–14}}</ref> Despite being a rich city, Surat looked like a typical "grubby" trader's town with mud-and-bamboo tenements and crooked streets, although along the riverfront there were a few mansions and warehouses belonging to local merchant princes and the establishments of Turkish, Armenian, English, French and Dutch traders. There were also hospitals for cows, horses, flies and insects run by religious [[Jain]]s, which puzzled travelers.<ref name="Eraly07" /> Some streets were narrow while others were of sufficient width. In the evening, especially near the Bazaar (marketplace), the streets became crowded with people and merchants (including [[Banyan merchants]]) selling their goods. Surat was a populous city during the Mughal era but also had a large transient population: during the [[monsoon]] season, when ships could come and go from the ports without danger, the city's population would swell.<ref name="Eraly07" /> In 1612, [[England]] established its first Indian [[trading factory]] in Surat.<ref name="EB" /> The city was looted twice by the Maratha king [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj|Shivaji]], with the first sacking occurring in 1664.{{r|municipality}}<ref name="EB" /> Shivaji's raids scared trade away and caused ruin to the city.<ref name="Eraly07" />

Later, Surat became the emporium of India, exporting gold and cloth. Its major industries were shipbuilding and textile manufacture.<ref name="EB" /> The coast of the [[Tapti River]], from Athwalines to Dumas, was specially meant for shipbuilders, who were usually Rassis.{{r|municipality}} The city continued to be prosperous until the rise of Bombay (present-day [[Mumbai]]). Afterward, Surat's shipbuilding industry declined and Surat itself gradually declined throughout the 18th century.{{r|municipality}}<ref name="EB" /> During 1790–1791, an epidemic killed 100,000 [[Gujaratis]] in Surat.<ref>{{cite book |page=193 |title=Eighteenth-Century Gujarat: The Dynamics of Its Political Economy, 1750–1800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=En_heITTXCoC&pg=PA193 |author=Ghulam A.

By the middle of the 19th century, Surat had become a stagnant city with about 80,000 inhabitants. When India's railways opened, the city started becoming prosperous again. [[Silk]]s, cotton, brocades, and objects of gold and silver from Surat became famous and the ancient art of manufacturing fine [[muslin]] was revived.<ref name="EB" />

=== Surat under British Raj ===
Under [[British Raj]], Surat saw a period of decline from its success under the Mughal Empire. Though it remained a pivotal city for textile-based products, it was less important to the British as a port city than it was for the Mughals. Nevertheless, Surat was very interconnected with Asia and Europe, involving trade with both Europeans and Armenian merchants.<ref name="maloni">{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27644270 |author=Maloni, Ruby. |title=Europeans in Seventeenth Century Gujarat: Presence and Response. |journal=Social Scientist |year=2008 |volume=36 |issue=3/4 |pages=64–99 |jstor=27644270 |access-date=26 November 2023}}</ref>

Tactically, Surat involved itself in trade in fields that did not compete with existing European products, such as pearls and silver.<ref name="lal">{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4399673 |author=Lal, Vinay |title=Review: Surat under the Raj. |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |year=1993 |volume=28 |pages=863–865 |jstor=4399673 |access-date=26 November 2023}}</ref> The textile industry was also a large portion of Surat’s shipping success. But despite being a primary port for textiles, Surat rarely manufactured these textiles locally.<ref name="maloni" /> Bullion was also quite important to Surat’s economy during this time. During his first-hand experience on a trip to Surat, Britisher [[John Ovington]] recalls the great ores Surat possessed, such as gold and silver.<ref name="johnOv">{{cite web |title=A Voyage To Surat In The Year 1689. |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.79805/page/n159/mode/2up |last=Ovington |first=John |website=Internet Archive |access-date=26 November 2023}}</ref> He recollects the notable “abundance of Pearls” and other precious stones like diamonds that could “be purchas’d here [Surat] at very reasonable rates.”<ref name="johnOv" /> As Ovington observed, this industry was imperative to Surat’s prosperity under the British Raj and allowed it to maintain its relevance as a port city.

During the [[Quit India Movement]] of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1942, A large number of 3,000 [[Koli people|Koli]] [[cultivator]]s from Matwad, Karadi, Machhad and Kothmadi in [[Surat]] [[List of districts of Gujarat|District]] fought against British soldiers at Matwad with lathis and dharias on 21 August 1942. In this fight, four persons including one policeman died. The kolis also snatched away four police muskets and two bayonets. Kolis smashed up the [[Jalalpore]] [[List of railway stations in India|Railway Station]], removed the Rails and burnt down the post office. After this, situation in the neighbouring villages of [[Borsad]], [[Anand, Gujarat|Anand]] and [[Thasra]] [[Tehsil|taluqas]] became so aggravated that British troops was marched through the villages between 22 and 24 August 1942.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Krishan|first=Shri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7sOGAwAAQBAJ&q=Matwad+Koli|title=Political Mobilization and Identity in Western India, 1934-47|date=2005-04-07|publisher=SAGE Publications India|isbn=978-81-321-0208-3|location=[[New Delhi]], [[India]]|pages=226|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardiman|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNA-AQAAIAAJ|title=Histories for the Subordinated|publisher=[[Seagull Books]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-905422-38-8|location=New Delhi, India|pages=157|language=en}}</ref>

=== Armenians in Surat ===
The Armenian community in Surat, [[India]], flourished from the [[16th century|16th]] to the [[17th century|17th]] centuries, leaving a lasting impact on the city's history. The Armenian gravestones in Surat, dating back to this period, are intricate and well-preserved, showcasing the community's presence and customs.

Armenians in Surat were renowned traders, dealing in jewelry, precious stones, cotton, and silk. They established trade routes to destinations such as [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], [[Turkey]], [[Venice]], and [[Livorno|Leghorn]], often traveling with their families.

The British recognised the Armenians' business prowess, seeking their cooperation for trading privileges in the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal court]]. Today, these gravestones serve as a poignant reminder of the Armenian community's significant contributions to Surat's history and culture.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ani |first=Margaryan |title=THE 16TH-17TH CENTURIES' ARMENIAN GRAVESTONES – A TESTAMENT TO THE ARMENIAN PRESENCE IN SURAT, INDIA |url=https://chinarmart.com/2023/08/26/the-16th-17th-centuries-armenian-gravestones-a-testament-to-the-armenian-presence-in-surat-india/ |website=Chinarmart |date=26 August 2023}}</ref>

=== Modern period ===

==== Post Independence ====
After India gained independence on 15 August 1947, Surat became part of India. At that time it was a part of Bombay State. Later it became the part of Gujarat state. Along with Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Nagpur and Vadodara, Surat became one of the fast growing cities and major commercial and industrial centers of Western India. During the post-independence period, Surat has experienced considerable growth in industrial activities especially textiles and chemical along with trading activities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Surat {{!}} District Surat, Government of Gujarat {{!}} India |url=https://surat.nic.in/about-surat/ |access-date=2022-04-07 |language=en-US |archive-date=18 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220518105938/https://surat.nic.in/about-surat/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

==== 1994 Plague ====
Surat faced a major health crisis in 1994. News of a plague outbreak in Surat occurred in September 1994, and when the possibility of quarantine for the city was mentioned, many residents of Surat fled the city.<ref name="pallipparambil">{{cite web |title=The Surat Plague and its Aftermath |url=https://www.montana.edu/historybug/yersiniaessays/godshen.html |last=Pallipparambil |first=Godshen Robert |website=Montana State University |access-date=26 November 2023}}</ref>

About a quarter of Surat’s population fled the city, including people who were in the incubation phase of the disease. This, in turn, partly contributed to the spread of the plague throughout India.

In the media, the cause of the plague was attributed to poor garbage disposal. However, the spread was instead brought about by rodents and fleas which were inadvertently caused by garbage in Surat. The disease ran more rampant through the slum population of Surat. In order to combat the spread of this disease, Surat closed its schools, universities, and public places for an indefinite period. They also ordered the shutdown of important industrial businesses, including diamond-cutting units.<ref name="pallipparambil" /> Eventually, antibiotics were given out and the plague was controlled.
Prior to the major plague outbreak, [[Surat Municipal Corporation]] was suspended in 1993, leaving no major elected body in charge. During the plague, [[Suryadevara Ramachandra Rao]] was elected as the new administrator and launched extensive cleaning campaigns to combat the outbreak.

This was a major step towards sanitation and cleanliness in Surat. Rao’s campaigns included launching hotel and shop inspections (to address their irresponsible garbage practices) for several months and calling for the broadening of roads.<ref name="shah1997">{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4405200 |author=Shah, Ghanshyam |title=Bureaucracy and Urban Improvement: Can It Made to Last? Post-Plague Scenario in Surat. |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |year=1997 |volume=32 |issue=12 |pages=607–613 |jstor=4405200 |access-date=26 November 2023}}</ref> He enforced designated sweeping of the city as well as the regular collection of garbage. Rao also demolished many illegal constructions. However, slums would often fall subject to removal when streets were widened, but Rao ensured that the residents were given alternative residential sites with adequate facilities to accommodate them. Rao’s urban and sanitary-related actions fostered the revival of Surat in its post-plague state.

Nevertheless, the plague had long-lasting implications for Surat. It brought attention to the lack of information and the spread of misinformation that occurred in India. Incorrect death tolls and false facts about the cause of the disease were spread, leaving lots of room for post-plague city revival both in terms of information control and cleanliness. Surat’s actions pertaining to the latter eventually resulted in the [[Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage]] deeming Surat as the second cleanest city in India.<ref name="shah1997" />

==== Present Day Surat ====
On 2 October 2007, Surat district was split into two by the creation of a new Tapi district, under the Surat District Re-organisation Act 2007.

== Geography ==
[[File:Tapi river.jpg|thumbnail|left|Tapi river]]
Surat is a port city situated on the banks of the [[Tapi River, India|Tapi]] river. After dams were built, water flow in Tapi deceased causing the original port facilities to close. The nearest port is now in the [[Magadalla]] and [[Hazira]] area of [[Surat Metropolitan Region]]. It has a famous beach called 'Dumas Beach' located in Dumas.The city is located at {{Coord|21.205|N|72.840|E|format=dms |region:IN_type:city}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latlong.net/place/surat-gujarat-india-6781.html |title=Location |publisher=latlong |access-date=13 June 2020 |archive-date=13 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613161027/https://www.latlong.net/place/surat-gujarat-india-6781.html |url-status=live}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 13 metres. The Surat district is surrounded by the [[Bharuch]], [[Narmada District|Narmada]], [[Navsari]] and Tapi districts, and [[Gulf of Cambay]] to the west. The climate is tropical and monsoon rainfall is abundant. According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-III]], in a scale of I to V (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes).<ref name="hazardprofile">{{cite web |url=http://www.caee.uottawa.ca/India.pdf |title=Performance of buildings during the 2001 Bhuj earthquake |access-date=3 August 2008 |work=Jag Mohan Humar, David Lau, and Jean-Robert Pierre |publisher=The Canadian Association for Earthquake Engineering |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710000016/http://www.caee.uottawa.ca/India.pdf |archive-date=10 July 2007}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Surat has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: Aw), moderated strongly by the Sea to the Gulf of Camboy. The summer begins in early March and lasts until June. April and May are the hottest months, the average maximum temperature being {{cvt|37|C|F|0}}. [[Monsoon]] begins in late June and the city receives about {{cvt|1200|mm|in}} of rain by the end of September, with the average maximum being {{cvt|32|C|F}} during those months. October and November see the retreat of the monsoon and a return of high temperatures until late November. Winter starts in December and ends in late February, with average mean temperatures of around {{cvt|23|C|F}}, and negligible rain.

Since the 20th century, Surat has experienced some 20 floods.<ref name="citiscope.org">{{cite web |url=http://citiscope.org/story/2015/what-surat-learned-preventable-flood |title=What Surat learned from a preventable flood {{!}} Citiscope |website=citiscope.org |language=en |access-date=8 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308103442/http://citiscope.org/story/2015/what-surat-learned-preventable-flood |archive-date=8 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1968, most parts of the city were flooded and in 1994 a flood caused a country-wide plague outbreak, Surat being the epicenter.

=== Public Safety ===
Surat began the 'Safe City Project' in 2011 aimed at keeping the city safe using surveillance cameras. The project was headed by Sanjay Srivastava (IPS) who was then the Joint-Commissioner of Surat Police. The 280-square-foot video wall claimed to be the largest surveillance screen in the country, is being installed in the control room of Police Commissioner Mr. Rakesh Asthana (IPS). This will help the police view the entire city live through 10,000 CCTV cameras across the city. Surat police have decided to install 5,000 CCTV cameras at sensitive points across the city. While 1,000 cameras will be night vision cameras, 4,000 others will be simple CCTV cameras. This has been installed on PPP base with the help of the city's businessmen, the city's social persons, [[Surat Municipal Corporation]], and the Surat City Police.
