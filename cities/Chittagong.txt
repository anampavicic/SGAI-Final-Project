The [[Nawab of Bengal]] ceded the port to the [[British East India Company]] in 1793. The Port of Chittagong was re-organized in 1887 and its busiest shipping links were with [[British Burma]]. In 1928, Chittagong was declared a "Major Port" of [[British India]]. During [[World War II]], Chittagong was a base for [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] engaged in the [[Burma Campaign]]. The port city began to expand and industrialize during the 1940s, particularly after the [[Partition of British India]]. The city was the historic terminus of the [[Assam Bengal Railway]] and [[Pakistan Eastern Railway]]. During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, Chittagong was the site of the [[Bangladeshi declaration of independence]]. The port city has benefited from the growth of [[heavy industry]], logistics, and manufacturing in Bangladesh. Trade unionism was strong during the 1990s.

Chittagong accounts for 12% of Bangladesh's GDP, including 40% of industrial output, 80% of [[international trade]], and 50% of [[tax]] revenue. The port city is home to many of the oldest and largest companies in the country. The Port of Chittagong is one of the busiest ports in [[South Asia]]. The [[BNS Issa Khan|largest base]] of the [[Bangladesh Navy]] is located in Chittagong, along with an air base of the [[Bangladesh Air Force]], garrisons of the [[Bangladesh Army]] and the main base of the [[Bangladesh Coast Guard]]. The eastern zone of the [[Bangladesh Railway]] is based in Chittagong. The [[Chittagong Stock Exchange]] is one of the twin stock markets of Bangladesh with over 700 listed companies. The [[Chittagong Tea Auction]] is a [[Commodities exchange|commodity exchange]] dealing with [[Tea production in Bangladesh|Bangladeshi tea]]. The [[Chittagong Export Processing Zone|CEPZ]] and [[Karnaphuli Export Processing Zone|KEPZ]] are key industrial zones with foreign direct investments. The city is served by [[Shah Amanat International Airport]] for domestic and external flights. [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel]], the first and only [[Underwater tunnel|underwater road tunnel]] of South Asia, is located in Chittagong. The city is the hometown of prominent economists, a Nobel laureate, scientists, freedom fighters and entrepreneurs. Chittagong has a high degree of religious and ethnic diversity among Bangladeshi cities, despite having a great [[Muslim]] majority. Minorities include [[Hindus]], [[Christians]], [[Buddhists]], [[Chakma people|Chakmas]], [[Marma people|Marmas]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuris]], [[Garo people|Garos]] and others.

The Bengali word for Chittagong, ''Chattogram (চট্টগ্রাম)'', has the suffix "-gram" (গ্রাম) meaning village in [[Standard Bengali]]. The earliest records, before Islam reached the region, state that it was a place of chaitya or Buddhist monasteries. The city had a very large Buddhist population before Islam. The city was renamed ''Islamabad (City of Islam)'' during the Mughal era. The name continues to be used in the old city.

Arab Muslim traders frequented Chittagong from the 9th century. In 1154, [[Al-Idrisi]] wrote of a busy shipping route between [[Basra]] and Chittagong, connecting it with the [[Abbasid]] capital of [[Baghdad]].<ref name="banglapedia.org"/>

During the 13th and 16th centuries, [[Arabs]] and [[Persians]] heavily colonized the port city of Chittagong, initially arriving for trade and to spread [[Islam]].

Persians and other [[Iranic peoples]] have deeply affected the history of the Bengal Sultanate, with Persian being one of the main languages of the Muslim state, as well as also influencing the Chittagonian language and writing scripts.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Role of the Persian Language in Bengali and the World Civilization: An Analytical Study |url=https://www.uits.edu.bd/research/journal/v1i2/7-Persian.pdf |website=uits.edu |access-date=4 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031134308/http://uits.edu.bd/research/journal/v1i2/7-Persian.pdf |archive-date=31 October 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Eaton |first1=Richard M. |title=The rise of Islam and the Bengal frontier, 1204–1760 |date=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |isbn=9780195635867}}</ref> It has been affirmed that much of the Muslim population in Chittagong are descendants of the Arab and Persian settlers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bangladesh – Ethnic groups |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangladesh/Ethnic-groups |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=6 February 2024 |language=en}}</ref>

Two decades after [[Vasco Da Gama]]'s landing in [[Calicut]], the Bengal Sultanate permitted the Portuguese settlement in Chittagong to be established in 1528. It became the first European colonial enclave in Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate lost control of Chittagong in 1531 after Arakan declared independence and the established Kingdom of Mrauk U. This altered geopolitical landscape allowed the Portuguese unhindered control of Chittagong for over a century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Biplab |date=2005 |title=European trade and colonial conquest |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=1-84331-029-5}}</ref>

Portuguese ships from Goa and [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] began frequenting the port city in the 16th century. The ''[[cartaz]]'' system was introduced and required all ships in the area to purchase naval trading licenses from the Portuguese settlement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=M.N. |date=2006 |title=The Portuguese in India |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-02850-7}}</ref> [[History of slavery|Slave trade]] and piracy flourished. The nearby island of [[Sandwip]] was conquered in 1602. In 1615, the [[Portuguese Navy]] defeated a joint [[Dutch East India Company]] and Arakanese fleet near the coast of Chittagong.

In 1666, the Mughal government of Bengal led by viceroy [[Shaista Khan]] moved to retake Chittagong from Portuguese and Arakanese control by launching the Mughal conquest of Chittagong. The Mughals attacked the Arakanese from the jungle with a 6,500-strong army, which was further supported by 288 Mughal naval ships blockading the Chittagong harbor.<ref name=":0">Trudy, Ring; M.

Mughal rule ushered a new era in the history of Chittagong territory to the southern bank of Kashyapnadi (Kaladan River). The port city was renamed Islamabad. The Grand Trunk Road connected it with [[North India]] and Central Asia. Economic growth increased due to an efficient system of land grants for clearing hinterlands for cultivation. The Mughals also contributed to the architecture of the area, including the building of Fort Ander and many mosques. Chittagong was integrated into the prosperous Bengali economy, which also included [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Bihar]].<ref name="Eaton"/><ref name="books.google.com.my">Chittagong, Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places [https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&dq=french+east+india+company+chittagong&pg=PT344]</ref> Shipbuilding increased dramatically under the Mughal rule, and the Ottoman Sultans had many Ottoman warships built in Chittagong during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shipbuilding_Industry |title=Shipbuilding Industry |website=Banglapedia}}</ref>

In 1685, the British East India Company sent out an expedition under Admiral Nicholson with the instructions to seize and fortify Chittagong on behalf of the English; however, the expedition proved abortive. Two years later, the company's Court of Directors decided to make Chittagong the headquarters of their Bengal trade and sent out a fleet of ten or eleven ships to seize it under Captain Heath. However, after reaching Chittagong in early 1689, the fleet found the city too strongly held and abandoned their attempt at capturing it. The city was possessed by the Nawab of Bengal until 1793 when East India Company took complete control of the former Mughal province of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Osmany |first1=Shireen Hasan |last2=Mazid |first2=Muhammad Abdul |year=2012 |chapter=Chittagong Port |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chittagong_Port |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V10_315.gif |title=Imperial Gazetteer of India |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Hunter, William Wilson |author-link=William Wilson Hunter |year=1908 |location=Oxford, UK |pages=308, 309}}</ref>

The [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1823 threatened the British hold on Chittagong. There were several rebellions against British rule, notably during the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], when the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th companies of the 34th [[Bengal Army|Bengal Infantry Regiment]] revolted and released all prisoners from the city's jail. In a backlash, the rebels were suppressed by the [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles|Sylhet Light Infantry]].<ref name="banglapedia.org"/>

[[Arakan]] was annexed in 1829 and incorporated into the [[Bengal Presidency]].

Railways were introduced in 1865, beginning with the [[Eastern Bengal Railway]] connecting Chittagong to [[Dacca]] and [[Calcutta]]. Chittagong became the main gateway to [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/339699/indo-bangla-economic-relations|title=Indo-Bangla economic relations}}</ref> In the 1890s, Chittagong became the terminus of [[Assam Bengal Railway]]. The hinterland of Chittagong Port covered the [[tea]] and [[jute]]  producing regions of Assam and Bengal, as well as [[Assam oil|Assam's oil industry]]. Chittagong was also linked to the crucial [[oil and gas industry in Burma]]. Chittagong was a major center of trade with [[British Burma]]. It hosted many prominent companies of the British Empire.

The [[Chittagong armoury raid]] by Bengali revolutionaries in 1930 was a major event in British India's anti-colonial history.

===World War II===

During World War II, Chittagong became a frontline city in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Southeast Asian Theater]]. It was a critical air, naval and military base for Allied Forces during the [[Burma Campaign]] against Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] carried out [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] on Chittagong in April and May 1942, in the run-up to the aborted Japanese invasion of Bengal.<ref>{{cite news |date=9 May 1942 |title=Nippon Bombers Raid Chittagong |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19420509&id=WP0tAAAAIBAJ&pg=4560,1489075 |newspaper=The Miami News |agency=Associated Press}}{{Dead link|date=July 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=14 December 1942 |title=Japanese Raid Chittagong: Stung By Allied Bombing |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17799625 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=13 May 2013}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of Imphal]], the tide turned in favor of the Allied Forces.

Chittagong was a [[melting pot]] of ethnicities during the [[Bengal Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Bengal]] periods. Muslim immigration started as early as the seventh century, and significant Muslim settlements occurred during the medieval period. Muslim traders, rulers, and preachers from Persia and Arabia were the early Muslim settlers, and their descendants are the majority of the current Muslim population of the city. The city has a relatively wealthy and economically influential [[Shia Muslim]] community, including [[Ismaili]]s and [[Twelver]] Shias. The city also has many ethnic minorities, especially members of [[Jumma people|indigenous groups]] from the frontier hills of Chittagong Division, including [[Chakma people|Chakmas]], [[Rakhine people|Rakhines]] and [[Tripuri people|Tripuris]]; as well as [[Rohingya]] refugees. The Bengali-speaking [[Theravada Buddhists]] of the area, known as ''[[Barua]]s'', are one of the oldest communities in Chittagong and one of the last remnants of Buddhism in Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chakma |first=Niru Kumar |year=2012 |chapter=Buddhism |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Buddhism |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNeT-aAF9XwC&q=barua+in+chittagong&pg=PA16 |title=Contemporary Indian Buddhism: Tradition and Transformation |year=2008 |page=16 |isbn=9788182202474 |last1=Singh |first1=N.
