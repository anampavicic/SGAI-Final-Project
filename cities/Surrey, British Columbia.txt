'''Surrey''' (/ˈsɝɹi/) is a city in [[British Columbia]], Canada. It is located south of the [[Fraser River]] on the [[Canada–United States border]]. It is a member municipality of the [[Metro Vancouver]] regional district and metropolitan area. Mainly a suburban city, Surrey is the province's second-largest by population after [[Vancouver]] and the third-largest by area after [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]]. Seven neighbourhoods in Surrey are designated [[town centre]]s: [[Cloverdale, Surrey|Cloverdale]], [[Fleetwood, Surrey|Fleetwood]], [[Guildford, British Columbia|Guildford]], [[Newton, Surrey|Newton]], [[South Surrey]], and City Centre encompassed by [[Whalley, Surrey|Whalley]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Surrey Communities |url=https://www.surrey.ca/community/6798.aspx |access-date=February 1, 2019 |archive-date=January 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128082934/https://www.surrey.ca/community/6798.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==

Surrey was incorporated in 1879, and encompasses land formerly occupied by a number of [[Halqemeylem]]-speaking indigenous groups, including the [[Semiahmoo people|Semiahmoo]], [[Katzie]], and the [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen]] peoples.<ref name="City of Surrey 2019 h652">{{cite web | title=History of Surrey, BC | website=City of Surrey | date=December 11, 2019 | url=https://www.surrey.ca/about-surrey/history-of-surrey | access-date=August 15, 2023 | archive-date=August 15, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230815175029/https://www.surrey.ca/about-surrey/history-of-surrey | url-status=live }}</ref> When Englishman H.J. Brewer looked across the [[Fraser River]] from [[New Westminster]] and saw it was reminiscent of his native [[County of Surrey]] in England, the settlement of Surrey was placed on the map.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/whats-in-a-name/ |title=What's in a name? |date=November 20, 2013 |website=Surrey Now-Leader |accessdate=December 28, 2021 |archive-date=December 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211203075721/https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/whats-in-a-name/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The area then comprised forests of [[Douglas fir]], [[fir]], [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]], [[tsuga|hemlock]], [[blackberry]] bushes, and [[cranberry]] bogs. A portion of present-day Whalley (named after Harry Whalley, who owned and operated a gas bar at the bend in King George Blvd, (formerly King George Highway) at 108 Avenue, "Whalley's Corner") was used as a burial ground by the [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen]] (or Qw'ontl'en) Nation.

Settlers arrived first in Cloverdale and parts of South Surrey, mostly to farm, fish, harvest oysters, or set up small stores. Once the [[Pattullo Bridge]] was erected in 1937, the way was open for Surrey to expand. In the post-war 1950s, North Surrey's neighbourhoods filled with single-family homes and Surrey (not yet a city) became a bedroom community, absorbing commuters who worked in Burnaby or Vancouver.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the city witnessed unprecedented growth, as people from different parts of Canada and the world, particularly Asia, began to make the municipality their home. In 2013, it was projected to surpass the city of Vancouver as the most populous city in BC within the following 10 to 12 years.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bennett |first=Jill |date=June 18, 2013 |title=Surrey's population projected to surpass Vancouver's |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/653206/surreys-population-projected-to-surpass-vancouvers/ |access-date=September 29, 2015 |website=Global News |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017001357/http://globalnews.ca/news/653206/surreys-population-projected-to-surpass-vancouvers/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:King George Hub District, Surrey 2018.jpg|thumb|left|Whalley City Centre]]
The city is characterized by low population density [[urban sprawl]], typical of North American cities, which includes areas of residential housing, light industry and commercial centres and is prone to strip development and malls. Approximately {{convert|6091|acre|ha|order=flip}} or 27 percent of the land area is designated as part of the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] and can only be used for farming.<ref>{{Cite web |title=B.C.

Surrey is the 11th largest city in Canada, and is also the fifth-largest city in Western Canada (after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Vancouver]]). Surrey forms an integral part of Metro Vancouver as it is the second largest city in the region, albeit while also serving as the secondary economic core of the metropolitan area. When combined with the City of Vancouver, both cities account for nearly 50 percent of the region's population. In recent years, a rapidly expanding urban core in [[Whalley, Surrey|Downtown Surrey]], located in [[Whalley, Surrey|Whalley]] has transformed the area into the secondary downtown core in [[Metro Vancouver]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=British Columbia's Second City |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=February 16, 2012 |url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2012/02/british-columbias-second-city/1250/ |access-date=November 10, 2018 |archive-date=November 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110160114/https://www.citylab.com/life/2012/02/british-columbias-second-city/1250/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The New Surrey: The city's not-so-secret weapon |url=https://vancouversun.com/technology/surrey+city+secret+weapon/8069958/story.html |accessdate=January 27, 2021 |archive-date=September 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909222927/http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/surrey+city+secret+weapon/8069958/story.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Ethnicity ===
Within the City of Surrey itself feature many neighbourhoods including City Centre, Whalley, [[Newton, Surrey|Newton]], [[Guildford, British Columbia|Guildford]], [[Fleetwood, Surrey|Fleetwood]], [[Cloverdale, Surrey|Cloverdale]] and [[South Surrey]]. Each neighbourhood is unique and includes ethnically diverse populations. While Europeans and South Asians can be found in large numbers across the city, areas which house a large proportion of the former include South Surrey (72 percent) and Cloverdale (69 percent), with Newton (58 percent) and Whalley (51 percent) being home to large numbers of the latter.<ref>{{Cite web |title=South Surrey |url=https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-South-Surrey.pdf |access-date=July 26, 2019 |archive-date=October 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022000348/https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-South-Surrey.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Cloverdale |url=https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-Cloverdale.pdf |access-date=July 26, 2019 |archive-date=January 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128083227/https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-Cloverdale.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Newton |url=https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-Newton.pdf |access-date=July 26, 2019 |archive-date=January 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128083017/https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-Newton.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Whalley |url=https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-Whalley.pdf |access-date=July 26, 2019 |archive-date=October 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021215423/https://www.surrey.ca/files/Neighbourhood-Profile-Whalley.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Immigration to Surrey has drastically increased since the 1980s; this has created a more ethnically and linguistically diverse city. 52 percent do not speak English as their first language, while approximately 38 percent of the city's inhabitants are of [[South Asian Canadians in Greater Vancouver|South Asian]] heritage. Beginning in the 1990s, an influx of South Asians began moving to the city from the [[Punjabi Market, Vancouver|Punjabi Market]] neighbourhood of South Vancouver due to rising housing costs and rapidly increasing rent costs for businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/News/surrey/change-in-the-air-at-the-punjabi-market-as-businesses-depart-for-surrey?r |title=Change in the air at the Punjabi Market as businesses depart for Surrey |date=February 3, 2013 |access-date=August 2, 2021 |archive-date=August 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210802230604/https://vancouversun.com/News/surrey/change-in-the-air-at-the-punjabi-market-as-businesses-depart-for-surrey?r |url-status=live }}</ref> The outflow of these residents combined with increased immigration from the [[South Asia|Indian Subcontinent]] therefore established in Surrey one of the largest concentrations of South Asian residents in North America.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mapping Ethnicity Part One: South Asia In Surrey |url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Mapping+ethnicity+Part+South+Asia+Surrey/5547648/story.html |accessdate=January 27, 2021 |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016021700/http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Mapping+ethnicity+Part+South+Asia+Surrey/5547648/story.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Other significant groups which reside in the city include [[East Asian Canadians|East Asians]]{{efn|name=EastAsian}} (10.9 percent) and Southeast Asians{{efn|name=SoutheastAsian}} (9.7 percent).<ref name="SurreyCityMinority2021" /> Forming nearly 2.3 percent of the total population, the [[Black Canadians|Black]] community of Surrey is small, though the city is home to the largest Black population in British Columbia;{{cn|reason=cited source does not compare to other BC cities|date=April 2024}} roughly 21 percent of the entire Black population of the province resides in Surrey.<ref name="SurreyCityMinority2021" /> Similar to most cities across English-speaking Canada, a large majority (64 percent) of Surrey residents of [[European Canadians|European]] heritage can trace their roots to the [[British Isles]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915004&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&SearchText=Vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Ethnic+origin&TABID=1&type=0 |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census – Surrey, City [Census subdivision], British Columbia and British Columbia [Province] |first=Statistics Canada |last=Government of Canada |date=February 8, 2017 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |accessdate=December 28, 2021 |archive-date=December 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211229003921/https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915004&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&SearchText=Vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Ethnic+origin&TABID=1&type=0 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===

Farming has strongly been attached to the economic well-being of Surrey, as the city of Surrey itself fostered and cemented a robust culture of farming. Approximately a third of Surrey's land is preserved and designated as farmland that is utilized for the local production of food to cater the city's growing population as well as increasing employment opportunities via the creation of local jobs. Agriculture continues to invigorate Surrey's economy employing 3300 people or 1.6 percent of Surrey's overall labour force. Manufacturing is also a highly diversified sector where products are produced for developed and emerging industries that range from the cutting of lumber for various BC logging firms to constructing wind turbines as many Surrey-based environmental firms are capitalizing on the city's initiatives for the clean energy sector.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Economic Development |url=http://www.surrey.ca/business-economic-development/3506.aspx |access-date=February 14, 2015 |publisher=City of Surrey |archive-date=February 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215065730/http://www.surrey.ca/business-economic-development/3506.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Farming |url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/Agriculture_Sector_Profile_LORES.pdf |access-date=February 14, 2015 |publisher=City of Surrey |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112038/http://www.surrey.ca/files/Agriculture_Sector_Profile_LORES.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Every October since 1991, Surrey has hosted the [[Surrey International Writers' Conference]]. This event brings established writers, agents, editors and publishers from all over the world to the Comfort Inn & Suites Surrey Hotel and Sheraton Vancouver Guildford Hotel in [[Guildford Town Centre]].

There are presently three live theatre venues in the City of Surrey in British Columbia as of January 2013: the Bell Centre for Performing Arts, the [[Chandos Pattison Auditorium]] and the Surrey Arts Centre.<ref>Kelly Sinoski, The New Surrey: Developing six cities at once: Surrey must build and link town centres while maintaining their unique traits, [[Vancouver Sun]], January 26, 2013, p.A12</ref>

One of the lesser-known events in Surrey is the annual Nicomekl River Race. Every year, in early June, teams of four meet at Nicomekl Park in [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley, British Columbia]] to begin the race. Unlike most traditional boat races, the Nicomekl River Race requires that all boats be made by the participants. The racecourse extends from Nicomekl Park to Blackie Spit Park at Crescent Beach. The first team to reach the mouth of the river is awarded a prize of $1,000. Additional prizes are awarded to the most creative boat and costume. All proceeds go towards the BC Cancer society.

== Sports and recreation ==

Every summer, Surrey hosts the [[Canada Cup (softball)|Canada Cup]] International Women's Fastpitch Tournament. It began in 1993 as an international women's [[softball|fastpitch]] developmental softball [[tournament]] to help teams prepare for the [[summer Olympics|Olympics]] by facing top-calibre competition. The event continues to be a fan favourite with gate attendance reaching 93,000 for the nine-day tournament in 2004.

The [[British Columbia Hockey League|BCHL]] [[Surrey Eagles]] [[ice hockey|hockey]] team plays at the South Surrey Arena in Surrey. The Eagles won the BCHL championship, the [[Fred Page Cup]], in 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2013; the western championship, the [[Doyle Cup]], in 1997 and 1998; and the national championship, the [[Royal Bank Cup]], in 1998.

Surrey hosted the Canadian national qualifying tournament in 2006, and sends a local team to compete for a spot in the [[Little League World Series]] in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]].

==Transportation==
===History===
The first non-Indigenous settlement of Surrey was founded near [[Crescent Beach, Surrey|Crescent Beach]], located in [[South Surrey]]; another was founded near Bridgeview/[[Brownsville, British Columbia|Brownsville]], located in North Surrey. Early trails and roads helped to encourage the settlement of Surrey. The first trail built by a settler was the 1861 the [[Kennedy Trail]]. James Kennedy built the trail to provide a route between New Westminster and the natural pasture land on the Mud Bay Flats next to the Serpentine River.<ref>Early Trails and Roads in the Lower Fraser Valley, W. N. Draper, British Columbia Historical Quarterly, January 1943, Vol. 7, p. 49-56.</ref> The Semiahmoo Wagon Road was built in 1873 between Brownsville (opposite New Westminster) and Semiahmoo (Blaine).<ref>The Semiahmoo Trail: Myths Makers Memories by Ron Dowle, Surrey Historical Society, 1998.</ref> The first regular ferry service across the Fraser River started in 1882 on the steam ferry ''K de K'', with the point of departure at Brownsville.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 11, 1993 |title=Surrey History |url=http://members.shaw.ca/jack_brown/surrey.html |access-date=March 9, 2011 |website=Members.shaw.ca |archive-date=June 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090613034316/http://members.shaw.ca/jack_brown/surrey.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The ferry landed on the Surrey side at the start of Old Yale Road, which connected directly inland to Yale and was a major gold rush trail.

The [[New Westminster Bridge|New Westminster Rail Bridge]] was opened in 1904, allowing personal vehicles to cross the [[Fraser River]] on the upper deck. The lower deck, for rail, enabled [[British Columbia Electric Railway|BC Electric Railway]] to finally construct the Interurban line, an electric suburb commuter rail route connecting Chilliwack to Vancouver. It opened for service in 1910, and ran through Kennedy, [[Newton Town Centre|Newton]], Sullivan, and [[Cloverdale, Surrey|Cloverdale]]. Currently, two of the BCER cars (1225 & 1304) are nearly finished being restored for operation on the mainline between Cloverdale and Sullivan. New car barns and museum currently under construction in Cloverdale (as of 2012).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fraser Valley Heritage Railway Society |url=http://www.fvhrs.org/ |access-date=August 1, 2012 |website=Fvhrs.org |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720053612/http://www.fvhrs.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1937, the then two-lane [[Pattullo Bridge]] linking [[New Westminster]] and Surrey was opened.

In the early 1950s, BC Electric Railways ceased operating its interurban line, thus increasing the number of vehicles on Surrey roads. [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]] was built in 1953, and [[British Columbia Highway 15|Highway 15]] in 1957. In 1964, the provincial government completed Highway 401 and the [[Port Mann Bridge]]; that section of roadway would later be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]]. In 1959, the [[George Massey Tunnel]] was opened, along with what is known as [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]]. With the completion of the new Highways 1 and 99, the Fraser Highway and King George Boulevard became major arteries.

In the early 1990s, Surrey saw the return of rail transit with the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] expansion into Surrey. The four stations added were [[Scott Road station|Scott Road]], [[Gateway station (SkyTrain)|Gateway]], [[Surrey Central station|Surrey Central]] and [[King George station|King George]].

Public transit in Surrey, as with the rest of Metro Vancouver, is operated by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], which provides frequent bus service throughout Surrey, and to other Metro Vancouver municipalities. Metro Vancouver's metropolitan rail system, SkyTrain, provides Surrey with an Expo Line service to [[Downtown Vancouver]] via four stations: Scott Road, Gateway, Surrey Central, and King George.

===Future transportation===
Funding a [[Surrey LRT|light rail transit]] (LRT) line linking both [[Newton, Surrey|Newton]] and Guildford with [[Surrey City Centre]] was agreed to by both BC's provincial government and the federal government. The project was unpopular, and after electing a new mayor and council in October 2018, who had run on a platform to cancel the LRT line in favour of extending the existing SkyTrain line to Langley, made it their first order of business.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Surrey council passes motions to scrap LRT, start municipal police force – CBC News |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mccallum-first-day-as-mayor-1.4893538 |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107042135/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mccallum-first-day-as-mayor-1.4893538 |url-status=live }}</ref> TransLink's Mayors' Council, who has the ultimate authority over the project, responded to this decision by indefinitely suspending work on the light rail project.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Metro Vancouver mayors agree to suspend Surrey LRT, start process for SkyTrain to Langley – CBC News |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/metro-vancouver-mayors-council-first-meeting-mccallum-1.4907048 |access-date=November 16, 2018 |archive-date=December 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211204173558/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/metro-vancouver-mayors-council-first-meeting-mccallum-1.4907048 |url-status=live }}</ref> In July 2019, a {{convert|7|km|adj=on}} Expo Line extension from King George station to 166 Street and [[Fraser Highway]] in [[Fleetwood, Surrey|Fleetwood]] was approved and is estimated to be completed by 2025.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chan |first=Kenneth |date=December 9, 2018 |title=TransLink could open new 16-km SkyTrain in Surrey by 2025 |work=Daily Hive |url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/translink-skytrain-surrey-potential-timeline-december-2018 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209224310/https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/translink-skytrain-surrey-potential-timeline-december-2018 |archive-date=December 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Chan |first=Kenneth |date=July 25, 2019 |title=Mayors' Council approves first phase of new Surrey-Langley SkyTrain up to Fleetwood |url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/surrey-langley-fraser-highway-skytrain-fleetwood-july-25-2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728040900/https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/surrey-langley-fraser-highway-skytrain-fleetwood-july-25-2019 |archive-date=July 28, 2019 |access-date=July 28, 2019 |website=Daily Hive}}</ref> However, the plan is now to take the SkyTrain the entire way to Langley in one phase by 2028.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Surrey-to-Langley SkyTrain won't be up and running until 2028 |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/8205897/surrey-to-langley-skytrain-2028-finish-date/ |access-date=July 10, 2022 |website=Global News |archive-date=September 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922052446/https://globalnews.ca/news/8205897/surrey-to-langley-skytrain-2028-finish-date/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Sustainable development ==

In 2008, Surrey city council created and adopted the Surrey Sustainability Charter:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sustainability Charter: a commitment to sustainability |url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/Sustainability_Charter.pdf |access-date=February 13, 2013 |publisher=City of Surrey |archive-date=August 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818092829/http://www.surrey.ca/files/Sustainability_Charter.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> a comprehensive document spanning 72 pages that takes a comprehensive look at all facets of society and creates an overarching document to guide the urban development of the city for the next 50 years. In 2011, the city council released the second update to the 2008 document indicating the progress made in the three years since the inception of the report.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sustainability Charter update 2011 |url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/2011FinalSustainabilityReport_web.pdf |access-date=February 13, 2013 |publisher=City of Surrey |archive-date=May 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513120432/http://surrey.ca/files/2011FinalSustainabilityReport_web.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Problems ===
{{Anchor|Hurdles}}Being an all-inclusive plan requires an interplay of many complex and sometimes [[wicked problems]]. Trying to account for all problems is ambitious, and as the report admits, being at the municipal level reduces the funding, power and resources to implement the vision. The report acknowledges the political hurdle and notes that the city needs to influence players with more power such as the provincial or federal government in order for the vision to be successful.

Some other hurdles that have arisen since the inception of the charter include the following:

==== Suburban sprawl and the Gateway Program ====
[[File:Holland Park, Surrey BC2.jpg|thumb|Holland Park and Residential towers in Surrey]]
{{See also|Urban sprawl|Gateway Program}}

Surrey currently faces the problem of urban sprawl, the phenomenon that is characterized by the low density residential, with almost no commercial or industrial zoning. This results in a heavy outflow of traffic in the morning, and inflow in the evening.

The announcement of the Gateway Program in 2005 by the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation]] meant a large expenditure in transportation infrastructure. Despite the oppositions by the [[Metro Vancouver]] and several mayoral councils,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Burnaby Public Consultation on Provincial Gateway Program |url=http://www.burnaby.ca/Assets/city+services/roads+and+traffic/Transportation+-+Gateway+-+January+15+2007+Council+Report.pdf |access-date=February 13, 2013 |publisher=City of Burnaby |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101816/http://www.burnaby.ca/Assets/city+services/roads+and+traffic/Transportation+-+Gateway+-+January+15+2007+Council+Report.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Standing Committee Minutes |url=http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/20060606/documents/ttmin.pdf |access-date=February 13, 2013 |publisher=City of Vancouver}}</ref> the project went ahead to create the [[South Fraser Perimeter Road]] and the Port Mann Bridge, both which pass through major portions of Surrey. It has been criticized to be contradictory to not only Metro Vancouver's Sustainable Region Initiative,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Proposed twinning of the Port Mann Bridge and Highway 1 expansion |url=http://www.livableregion.ca/pdf/PortMannBriefingJune06.pdf |access-date=February 13, 2013 |publisher=David Suzuki Foundation |archive-date=June 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626210338/http://www.livableregion.ca/pdf/PortMannBriefingJune06.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> but also Surrey's Sustainability Charter. Studies have shown that with an increase in road capacity, ''generated traffic'' increases, that is traffic that is diverted (shifted in time and route) and induced travel (increased total motor vehicle travel).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Litman |first=Todd |date=September 10, 2012 |title=Generated Traffic and Induced Travel Implications for Transport Planning |url=http://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf |access-date=February 11, 2013 |publisher=Victoria Transport Policy Institute |archive-date=March 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310045906/http://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> With the construction of the 10 lane Port Mann Bridge, the problem of suburban sprawl is exacerbated not only with the additional capacity, but [[RapidBus (TransLink)|RapidBus]] service was also cancelled despite expectations of a stop in Surrey.<ref>{{Cite news |date=November 23, 2012 |title=Dianne Watts angry Surrey dropped from RapidBus plans |work=News 1130 |url=http://www.news1130.com/2012/11/23/dianne-watts-angry-surrey-dropped-from-rapidbus-plans/ |access-date=February 13, 2013 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522004406/http://www.news1130.com/2012/11/23/dianne-watts-angry-surrey-dropped-from-rapidbus-plans/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Transportation and land use ====

The Sustainability Charter hinges on a large reduction on [[automobile dependency]] requiring a well established transit infrastructure to the multiple districts of Surrey. In 2008, [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] announced the extension of the [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] beyond the current terminus to as far as Langley.<ref>{{Cite news |date=January 16, 2008 |title=More Skytrains for Surrey |work=Surrey Leader |id={{ProQuest|373127516}}}}</ref> However, financial shortfall came upon Translink shortly after, and many of the announced plans came to a halt. Plans to expand northward via the [[Evergreen Extension|Evergreen extension]] came to fruition prior to the vision of extending [[light rail]] out to Guildford, Newton and Langley. Mayor Watts attempted impose equal tolling across the region to assist with funding transit to reduce car reliance.<ref>{{Cite news |date=June 15, 2012 |title=A better Surrey hinges on halted transit plans |work=The Globe and Mail |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/a-better-surrey-hinges-on-halted-transit-plans/article4279109/ |access-date=February 13, 2013 |archive-date=May 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520082048/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/a-better-surrey-hinges-on-halted-transit-plans/article4279109/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Protecting agricultural land reserves also play an important part in the charter of sustainability. The idea behind the agricultural land reserves is to encourage and increase the role of urban agriculture, thus reducing the reliance of food transport and increasing the quality and availability of food to local people. The Charter takes the idea one step further by encouraging food processing [[agribusiness]] to complete the supply chain circle.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sustainability Charter: a commitment to sustainability |url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/Sustainability_Charter.pdf |access-date=February 13, 2013 |publisher=City of Surrey |pages=20 |archive-date=August 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818092829/http://www.surrey.ca/files/Sustainability_Charter.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In a case study of Toronto completed by Pierre Filion, he claims that while transit and natural area conservation are successful at achieving their respective immediate objectives, they "do not modify metropolitan-wide relations between transportation and land use...in a fashion that is consistent with smart growth". Filion identifies that the largest obstacles are [[NIMBY]] reactions from the public and the limited finances from the public sector.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Vojnovic |editor-first=Igor |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781609173470/ |title=Urban sustainability : a global perspective |publisher=Michigan State University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9781611860559 |location=East Lansing |pages=509–523 |access-date=February 13, 2013 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017001357/http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781609173470/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Higher education ===
Surrey's local higher education needs are met by the two major research universities in the neighboring municipalities of the [[Metro Vancouver|Vancouver Metropolitan Area]], the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Simon Fraser University]]. In addition to several career, community, and junior colleges that offer [[Vocational_school|vocational]] and [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]] education throughout the city, [[trade school|trades]] and [[technical school|technical career education]] is mainly provided by [[College (Canada)|colleges]] such as [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]] in the Cloverdale and Newton area and by the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] in the neighboring municipality of Burnaby. 

Surrey is home to the third satellite campus of [[Simon Fraser University]], the SFU Surrey Campus, which opened its doors in 2002, acting as a satellite campus operating as a public research university as well as providing further impetus for shaping the city.
