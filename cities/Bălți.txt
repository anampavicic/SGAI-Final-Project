'''Bălți''' ({{IPA|ro|ˈbəltsʲ|-|Ro-Bălți.ogg}}) is a city in [[Moldova]]. It is the second-largest city in terms of population, area and economic importance, after [[Chișinău]]. The city holds the status of [[municipiu]]. Sometimes called "the northern capital", it is a major industrial, cultural and commercial centre and transportation hub in the north of the country. It is situated {{convert|127|km}} north of the capital Chișinău, and is located on the river [[Răut River|Răut]], a tributary of the [[Dniester]], on a hilly landscape in the [[Bălți Steppe|Bălți steppe]].

==Name==
The word "''bălți''" (pl. of [[Romanian language|Romanian]] sing. "''baltă''") in direct translation means "puddle".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.ectaco.co.uk/main.jsp?do=e-services-dictionaries-word_translate1&direction=1&status=translate&lang1=23&lang2=ro&source=swamp|title=Electronic Dictionary, Electronic Translator, Software for Translation for 45 languages - ECTACO UK|website=online.ectaco.co.uk|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> It is believed that the city had been named thus because it was founded on a hill dominating the wetland formed where the creek Răuțel ("Little Răut") falls into the river Răut.

In addition to the official name ''Bălți'' and the Russian name {{lang|ru|Бельцы}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|Beltsy}}), between 1940 and 1989 in [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]], and after 1989 in Russian, the name was/is also rendered in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] as {{lang|ru|Бэлць}} ({{IPA|ru|ˈbɛɫts}}).

==History and symbols==

{{further|History of Bălți}}

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Balti-arm.jpg|thumb|left|Current coat of arms]]
The current [[coat of arms]] and flag of Bălți, elaborated by Silviu Tabac from the Moldovan State Commission for [[Heraldry]], were adopted by the Municipal Council in April 2006.

A shield, with alternating six silvery strips (symbolizing water), and six blue strips (symbolizing earth), form the background (symbolizing the [[#Name|name of the city]]). The central element of the shield is an [[Archery|archer]] in red clothes, in the military outfit (yellow) of [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: Ștefan cel Mare) times (15th century). The archer represents the medieval [[military recruitment]], formed by local free peasants.<ref>In medieval [[Moldavia]] ''Arcașii lui Ștefan'' (''Stephen's archers'')  were free peasants paying tax only to the country's ruler and ready to serve at the first call. They formed the first line of defence against invaders, and often had to defend their villages and families themselves or hide them in the forests before the [[Principality]]'s army would come to relief. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Throughout the hilly part (i.e. most) of Moldova, many summits have an additional man-made earth addition of up to {{convert|10|m|abbr=off}} in some places, where [[warning fires]] were located in the [[early Middle Ages]]. One can easily recognize these spots on the Moldovan, now deforested, mainly cultivated landscape, all the way to the banks of the river [[Dniester]], across from which the Asian [[steppe]] begins, and can observe a repeating peculiarity: From each of the summits the otherwise obscured neighborhood is very well observable, with at least three other such spots in clear view, although possibly at a couple hours' walking distance.</ref>

On top of the shield is a silver crown in the shape of a fortress wall with seven towers. (The crown represents the fact that the locality is a city. Apart from Bălți, only the capital [[Chișinău]], and [[Tiraspol]] are allowed to have seven towers, while other cities must limit this number to three or five.) The shield is supported by two rearing silver horses (the white horse is the traditional symbol of the region, which was part of [[Iași County]] before 1812). Under the shield, there is a ribbon with the [[Latin]] inscription ''[[Cedant arma togae|CEDANT ARMA TOGAE]]'', meaning ''let arms yield to the [[toga]]''.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the archer was featured on the coats of arms of the region. In the 19th century, the city and district coats of arms also featured a horse head. In the early 20th century, a shield representing an archer, standing on a hill, the sun, and three [[Schoenoplectus|bullrush]] sticks (elements quite sufficient to identify the place where Bălți is situated in the landscape of the north of Moldova) formed the coat of arms of the Bălți county, while these and horse elements - the coat of arms of the city proper.

===Flag===
The city's flag is composed of two horizontal strips: a blue one on the bottom, and a silver one on top. The shield and archer elements from the coat of arms are also present in the centre of the flag.

==Geography==
Bălți is situated on the tops and slopes of three hills and in two small valleys. The land in the north of [[Moldova]] is very fertile, mostly consisting of [[Dark earth|black earth]] or [[chernozem]]. Several extraction sites for raw materials used in the construction industry are also found in the vicinity of Bălți. The creeks Răuțel, Copăceanca, and Flămândă cross the territory of the municipality, and flow into the river [[Răut River|Răut]]. Also, several lakes are situated in Bălți: City Lake, Komsolskoe Lake, Hunters and Fishermen Lake, Strâmba Lake.

The [[municipality]] covers an area of {{convert|78.0|km2}}, of which the city proper {{convert|41.42|km2}}, the village [[Elizaveta, Moldova|Elizaveta]] (an eastern suburb) {{convert|9.81|km2}}, and the village [[Sadovoe]] (a north-western suburb) {{convert|26.77|km2}}. Of these, an important portion ({{convert|20.11|km2}}) is agriculturally cultivated.

===Neighbourhoods===
The city itself is located on portions of three hills. The river Răut separates one of the hills to the north-east, the slopes of this hill are occupied by the neighbourhood Slobozia. Răut's affluent Răuțel separates another hill in the south, the slopes of which are the Podul Chișinăului. The largest of the three hills dominates the valleys of the creek and river, and contains the city centre and the old town, and the neighbourhoods Pământeni, [[Dacia, Bălți|Dacia]], 6th district, 8th district, the city's main industrial area, and Molodova neighborhood. The top of this hill is occupied by the medical facilities district. Bălții Noi neighborhood is situated in the valley of the Răuțel creek.

A Soroca neighborhood, 10th district, 9th district, the area of the former Bălți concentration camp, and the [[Bălți City Airport]] are situated in the valley of the Răut river.

The names of city neighborhoods reflect different historic influences, such as names of 19th century suburbs that are nowadays within city limits: ''Pământeni'', ''Slobozia'', ''Molodova'', ''Podul Chișinăului'', ''Bălții Noi''; others are known by their [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era names: ''6th district'', ''8th district'', ''9th district''. A neighbourhood in the northern part of the city is called ''Dacia'', and is colloquially sometimes referred to as ''BAM''. A district in the eastern part is known as ''10th district''.

Cultural venues in the city include:
* [[Bălți National Theatre|Vasile Alecsandri National Theatre]]
* The oldest surviving building, a two-story boyar house, right in the heart of the city centre, dates back to 1609. Though it has been re-constructed and re-modeled many times with total disregard to conservation to the extent that now it simply looks like an odd two-story building.
* Monument of Stephen the Great (2003)

Although [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], the building, financed by Gheorghe Panaiti, has a degree of [[catholic]] influence brought in by the architect Antuan Weismann from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]].
* [[Saint Constantine and Elena Cathedral, Bălți]] (1934), Orthodox, built in neo-[[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]]. The building, at which official opening the Romanian [[royal family]] was present, survived almost without visible effects the harsh treatment during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era. During this time it was mostly a depot and later turned into the municipal museum.

===Social aspects===
[[File:Balti (1985). (31938427254).jpg|thumb|A mass demonstration on a square in Bălți in 1985.]]
The post-independence decrease in the city population is mainly due to the [[Economy of Moldova|economic]] and [[Demographics of Moldova|demographic]] situation of Moldova, which prompted a wave of permanent or temporary emigration.

Remittances from the [[Foreign worker|migrant workers]] account for 30% of Moldova's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], the highest percentage in all of Europe.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=214287&data=2007-01-17 Romanii din strainatate vor sa revina in tara]</ref> Often, elderly relatives and children of these workers are left to live in Bălți.

The majority of the population of Bălți is bilingual ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]), but some people only know one of these two languages. Many people in the city also understand and/or speak [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].

===Pre-WWII Jewish Community===

"Between the two world wars, the Jewish community of Bălți was a vibrant population of trade, industry and culture, Zionism and Yiddish, political parties and youth movements. Bălți was the second-largest populated city in Bessarabia, with the second-largest number of Jewish inhabitants after Chișinău, and the economic center of the region. In the official 1930 census, Bălți was listed as having 14,229 Jewish residents, about 60% of its total population.

"Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Agreement, Bălți was absorbed into the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940, coming under Soviet rule.

"On 22 June 1941, the Germans invaded the USSR. On 9 July, Bălți was occupied by German and Romanian armies, and waves of abuse and murder began. At the end of July, the German units and Gestapo officers left the city in the hands of the Romanians. In September 1941 the last of the Jews of Bălți– some 2,800 people – were expelled to the Mărculești Camp, and the Jewish population of the city ceased to exist. In Mărculești, many members of the community died, and the rest were deported to Transnistria."

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Bălți}}

Historically Bălți was known for producing [[tobacco]]. They also had many [[vineyard]]s and [[orchard]]s.<ref name=Kaba>{{cite book|last=Kaba|first=John|title=Politico-economic Review of Basarabia|year=1919|publisher=American Relief Administration|location=United States|page=14|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7313/view/1/14/}}</ref>

Most of the city's industry centres on [[food processing]], notably in the production of flour, sugar, and wine. [[Manufacturing]] of furniture and agricultural machinery also plays an important role in Bălți's economy.

The [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] has developed after 1989 to cover the [[basic needs]] of the population.

===Manufacturing===
This city is an important economic centre, with [[manufacturing]] playing an important role. Besides traditional for Moldova [[Winemaking|wine making]], [[sugar]], [[Meat packing industry|meat processing]], [[Flour|flour milling]], oil production, and [[light industry]] in general, Bălți is the centre for manufacturing of [[agricultural machinery]], of various [[construction]] materials, fur, textile, chemical and furniture industries. A mammoth Soviet-type [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] 8,000-worker factory (called "Lenin" before 1989 and "Răut" afterwards) produced a large variety of machine [[Building material|building products]] for consumer or industry use, from [[Ironing|irons]] and [[Telephone|telephone sets]] to [[sonar]] equipment for [[Military history of the Soviet Union|Soviet military]] [[submarine]]s. However, due to swift changes in the economic environment after the breakdown of the Soviet [[planned economy]] system, the manufacturing base of the city has severely suffered. Nevertheless, more recently, new economic ties are being created, with collaboration and direct investment mostly from [[European Union|the European Union]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Lisa Dräxlmaier GmbH celebrated the inauguration of its second plant in Moldova. The facility, which will be located in Balti, will produce wiring harnesses. The plant has about {{convert|13,000|m2|sqft|lk=out|abbr=off}} of production and logistics space.

===Shopping===
Bălți has several major [[Chain store|shopping chain]] outlets, such as the German [[Metro AG|Metro Group AG]], Ukrainian Fourchette and Moldovan [[Fidesco Group|Fidesco]].

Numerous shops, can be found in the central (retail), eastern (en gros) and northern (retail) parts of the city. The biggest shopping galleries are located in the centre and in the Dacia district (north) of the city. Souvenir boutiques are mostly found around the central square Vasile Alecsandri. The central [[market (place)|market]] is open from early morning.

A variety of small private stores and supermarkets are available. There are also six public-owned and four private-owned markets. More recently several supermarket chains have opened stores in the city.

===Health facilities===
The city has a big Republican hospital, another multifunctional municipal hospital, a children's hospital, and a range of other medical facilities (smaller clinics and hospitals, as well as buildings, named poly-clinics, gathering doctors offices).<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.balti.md/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=18&id=58&Itemid=40 Health institutions] on balti.md</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Oficiul Stării Civile, Bălți.jpg|thumb|Register office in Bălți]]
'''Bălți Municipality''' is a [[Administrative divisions of Moldova|territorial unit]] of [[Moldova]] (one of its 3 municipalities not subordinated to other territorial units; it has had the status of municipality since 1994), containing the city itself, and the villages of [[Elizaveta, Moldova|Elizaveta]] and [[Sadovoe]].

The Mayor Office ({{langx|ro|Primăria}}) is headed by the [[Mayor of Bălți|Mayor]] ({{langx|ro|Primar}}), and administers the local affairs, while the Municipal Council serves as a consultative body with some powers of general policy determination. It is composed of 35 council members elected every four years. As a result of the last regional elections of local [[public administration]] held in June 2007, the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communist Party]] (PCRM) holds 21 mandates, 11 mandates are held by representatives of other parties, and 3 mandates by independents. There are two factions in the Municipal Council: the PCRM faction (21 members) and "Meleag" (Romanian for "Native land") faction (3 independents and 4 representatives of different parties).

The [[Mayor of Bălți|Mayor]] of the municipality is elected for four years. Vasile Panciuc, [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|PCRM]], is the incumbent from 2001 and was re-elected twice: in 2003 during the anticipated elections (as a result of a new reform of the [[administrative division]] in Moldova), and in 2007.

===Politics===
Until recently, voters in the Bălți municipality mainly supported the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|PCRM]]. This is explained by the fact that the municipality contains a large [[Russian language|Russian-speaking minority]] (43%) which primarily votes Communist. However, support for the [[Communists]] has seen a steady decline in the last three elections.

Bălți offers a choice of taxi services, most of which operate for a fixed fee in the [[inner city]]. Three taxi companies are branches of Moldovan national companies, two taxi companies are Bălți registered businesses.

===Road===
Bălți is an important transportation hub of [[Moldova]]. The best [[Transport|inter-city]] transportation is done by coach or van (privately or [[Public company|publicly owned]]). {{convert|135|km|0|abbr=off}} of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style highway (portions in good or fair condition) connect the city to the capital [[Chișinău]]. By road one can also reach [[Ukraine]] (in about 2 hours) to the north or to the east, and [[Romania]] (in about 1 hour) to the south-west by the [[Sculeni]]&ndash;[[Victoria, Iași|Sculeni]] crossing point, which leads to the Romanian city of [[Iași]] ({{convert|104|km|0|abbr=off}} from Bălți), or to the west by the [[Stânca-Costești Dam|Stânca&ndash;Costești]] crossing.

The [[railway]] lines are not electrified, and contain only a single track between stations. Since Moldova gained independence, the railway lines became the responsibility of [[Calea Ferată din Moldova]] (Railways of Moldova) state company.

There are two [[railway station]]s: Bălți-City Station and Bălți-Slobozia Station (the name of a city neighbourhood), which both serve internal and international traffic.
