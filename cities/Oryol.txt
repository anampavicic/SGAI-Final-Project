=== Early history ===
While there are no historical records, archaeological evidence shows that a fortress settlement existed between the [[Oka River]] and [[Orlik River]]s as early as the 12th century, when the land was a part of the [[Principality of Chernigov]]. The name of the fortress is unknown; it may not have been called Oryol at the time. In the 13th century, the fortress became a part of the [[Zvenigorod]] district of the [[Karachev]] Principality. In the early 15th century, the territory was conquered by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The city was soon abandoned by its population after being sacked either by Lithuanians or the [[Golden Horde]]. The territory became a part of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the 16th century.

=== Tsardom of Russia ===
[[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV Vasilyevich]] decreed that a new fortress be built on the spot in 1566 for the purpose of defending the southern borders of the country.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The fortress was built starting in the summer of 1566 and ending in the spring of 1567. The location chosen was less than ideal strategically, as the fortress was located on a seasonally flooded low ground easily targeted from the neighboring high ground. [[False Dmitry I]] and his army passed through Oryol in 1605; [[Ivan Bolotnikov]] in 1606; [[False Dmitry II]] camped in Oryol for the winter of 1607–1608. Polish forces sacked it in 1611 and 1615. While the population fled after the second sacking and moved to [[Mtsensk]], the Orlovsky Uyezd continued to exist administratively.

Oryol was rebuilt in 1636. The question of moving the fortress to the more advantageous high ground was debated until the 1670s, but the move was never made. The fortress was deemed unnecessary and taken apart in the early 18th century.

=== Russian Empire ===
In the mid-18th century Oryol became one of the major centers of grain production, with the Oka River being the major trade route until the 1860s when it was replaced by a railroad.

Oryol was granted town status in 1702. In 1708, Oryol was included as a part of [[Kiev Governorate]]; in 1719, [[Oryol Province]] was created within Kiev Governorate. The Province was transferred to the newly created [[Belgorod Governorate]] in 1727. On March&nbsp;11 (February&nbsp;28 [[Julian calendar|old style]])<!--check date-->, 1778 [[Oryol Vice-Royalty]] was created from parts of [[Voronezh Governorate|Voronezh]] and Belgorod Governorates. In 1779, the city was almost entirely rebuilt based on a new plan; and the Oryol River was renamed Orlik (lit: "little eagle").

=== Russian Republic ===
After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the city was in Bolshevik's hands, except for a brief period between October 13 and October 20, 1919, when it was controlled by [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[White movement|White Army]].

=== Soviet Union ===
Oryol was once again moved between different [[oblast]]s in the 1920s and 1930s: first as Oryol Governorate until 1928, then [[Central Black Earth Region]] between 1928 and 1934, finally in [[Kursk Oblast]]), finally becoming the administrative center of its own Oryol Oblast on September 27, 1937.

The [[Oryol Prison]] was a notable place of incarceration for political prisoners and war prisoners of the [[Second World War]]. [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Maria Spiridonova]], [[Olga Kameneva]] and 160 other prominent political prisoners were shot on September&nbsp;11, 1941 on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s orders in the [[Medvedev Forest massacre]] outside Oryol.

During the German-Soviet War, Oryol was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] on October&nbsp;7, 1941.

The French air squadron [[Normandie-Niemen]] fought in the skies over Oryol.

Oryol was liberated on August&nbsp;5, 1943 during the [[Operation Kutuzov|Oryol strategic offensive operation "Kutuzov"]] on the [[Battle of Kursk|Oryol-Kursk Bulge]]. The city was almost completely destroyed. By Order No .2 of I. V. Stalin of August 5, 1943, on this day in Moscow, an artillery salute was given to the troops that liberated Oryol. Since then, the city has had the nickname, "City of the First Salute", and the day of the liberation from the German invaders was celebrated as the city's day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

On September 19, 1943, in the Oryol, was the first parade of partisan units stationed in the Oryol region during the war.

== Geography ==
[[File:Oryol2006.jpg|thumb|right|Orlik River]]

=== Time zone ===
Oryol has the same time zone as Moscow (Moscow time), or UTC+03:00.<ref>{{cite web|title=Статья 5. Часовые зоны|url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_114656/b2707989c276b5a188e63bc41e7bcbcc18723de8/|website=consultant.ru}}</ref>

=== Location ===
Oryol stands on the banks of the [[Oka River]] and its tributary Orlik river in the [[Central Russian Upland]] of the [[East European Plain]], approximately {{convert|368|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-southwest of Moscow.

==={{anchor|Urban layout}}Layout===

Oryol was founded at the behest of Ivan the Terrible in 1566, in the area between the Oka and Orlik rivers. Little information exists about its early history; the earliest data available refers to 1636, when the city was rebuilt after its destruction during the [[Time of Troubles]]. According to historian T. G. Svistunova, the 16th-century Oryol fortress had three lines of fortifications and consisted of a city, an [[Ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] and a [[posad]] surrounded by gaps. The city housed a cathedral, a [[voivode]]'s (warlord or military leader's) house, government buildings and courts for the [[boyar]] children; the prison consisted of gunners' yards, a blacksmith, and two parish churches near the prison towers. In the posad was a [[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]]. In 1636, Oryol was rebuilt by the voivode B. Koltovsky; it expanded with annexation of land beyond the Oka. Oryol remained a fortress city with a corresponding garrison; Pushkarskaya Sloboda was still located in the prison, boyar children and nobles settled on the left bank of the Orlik, and a Cossack sloboda developed near the Oka. Oryol lost its military character after the 1689 fire, when the partially-burned city fortress was not rebuilt.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

In central Oryol, streets fan out from the fortress; two main axes are the Upper and Lower Korchak Roads. Opposite the fortress was probably a second marketplace in the Zaotsk section, where the dragoon settlements had a relatively-regular layout along the river. Away from the river, the grid becomes a fan. The city{{snd}}its fortress, three marketplaces, two monasteries and a number of parish churches{{snd}}was developed from the river. Its structure was visible from the Oka: the central fortress, the fan-shaped center and the grid of the Zaotsk settlements. The city was connected by bridges, making Oryol a military fortress and a trade center.<ref>{{cite thesis|title=Масштабность в планировке городов Центральной России : На примере Калуги, Тулы, Рязани, Орла, Брянска, Курска, Белгорода|lang=ru|author=Татьяна Николаевна|pages=84–86|place=Moscow|year=2001}}</ref>

The city's earliest plans, by Mikhail Buzovlev and Petr Botvinev, date to 1728. A 1778 plan fixed its radial layout, and a radial-semicircular system was proposed the following year. In 1848, a new plan including Polesskaya Square was approved.

Oryol's modern layout was developed in 1939 by Suborov, an architect at the leningrad-based [[Russian State Research and Design Institute of Urbanism]]. The first post-war reconstruction plan was made in Lengiprogor under the direction of architect V. A. Gaikovich. Oryol's development required a new general plan, which was drawn up in 1958 by V. A. Gaikovich and A. M. Suborov of Lengiprogor. The city's center was Lenin Square, on which the House of Soviets was built in 1961. In 1966, construction of flood-control embankments in the central city began.<ref>{{cite thesis|title=Масштабность в планировке городов Центральной России : На примере Калуги, Тулы, Рязани, Орла, Брянска, Курска, Белгорода|lang=ru|author=Татьяна Николаевна|pages=120–123|place=Moscow|year=2001}}</ref>

On November 3, 1898, Oryol inaugurated an electric tram. The draft was prepared by the Belgian entrepreneur FF Gilon and firm «Compagnie mutuelle de tramways», which won the right to build not only a tram, but also lighting in the city. Oryol tram is one of the oldest electric tram systems in Russia. It is 1 year older than Moscow and 9 years — St. Petersburg. In 2017, the length of the lines in double-track calculation was {{convert|18.3|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
