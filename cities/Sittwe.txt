'''Sittwe ''' ({{MYname|MY=စစ်တွေမြို့|MLCTS=cac twe mrui.}}, {{IPA-my|sɪʔtwè mjo̰}}), formerly '''Akyab''' ({{lang|my|အာကျပ်}}), is the capital of [[Rakhine State]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma). Sittwe is located on an [[estuarial]] island created at the confluence of the [[Kaladan River|Kaladan]], [[Mayu (river)|Mayu]], and [[Lay Mro]] rivers emptying into the [[Bay of Bengal]].

{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}
==Names==
The name Sittwe ({{lang|my|စစ်တွေမြို့}}) is derived from the [[Burmese language|Burmese pronunciation]] of [[Arakanese language|Arakanese]] {{lang|my|စစ်တွေ}}, meaning "the place where the war meets".{{fact|date=June 2024}} When the Burmese king [[Bodawpaya]] invaded the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U|Mrauk U Kingdom]] in 1784, the Rakhine defenders encountered the Burmese force at the mouth of Kaladan river. In the ensuing battle, which was waged on both land and water, the Mrauk U forces were defeated. The place where the battle occurred came to be called  ''Saittwe'' by the Rakhine and then as ''Sittwe'' by the Burmese. The name was initially [[anglicization of names|anglicized]] as ''Tset-twe''{{sfnp|Phayre|1841|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9TpLoLlZ0sQC&pg=PA692 692]}} and ''Site-tway''.

The colonial name Akyab ({{lang|my|အာကျပ်}}) derived from the town's hill ''Akyatkundaw''{{sfnp|Forchhammer|1891|p=59}} or ''A-khyat-dau-kun''<!--replace with modern transcription once known--> ({{lang|my|ကုန်း}}), named for one of its four [[stupa]]s whose own name ''Ankyeit'',{{sfnp|Forchhammer|1891|p=59}} ''Akyattaw'',{{sfnp|Forchhammer|1891|p=59}} ''Akyatdaw''{{sfnp|Smith|1882|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fnQIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA132 132]}} or ''Ahkyaib-daw''{{fact|date=June 2024}}<!--and provide Burmese form: ?တော်?--> ("Royal Rear-Jaw Pagoda") referenced its supposed possession of a [[Relics associated with Buddha|Buddhist relic]], a rear section of [[Siddhartha Gautama]]'s [[jawbone]].{{sfnp|Phayre|1841|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9TpLoLlZ0sQC&pg=PA692 692]}}

==History==
[[File:Police Checkpoint with Closed-Off Muslim (Rohingya) Area (Aung Mingalar) - Sittwe - Rakhaing (Arakan) State - Myanmar (Burma) (12232262756).jpg|thumb|Police checkpoint in Sittwe with closed-off Rohingya Muslim area in the background.]]
The area of modern Sittwe was the location of a battle during the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] (later [[Arakan]] and now [[Rakhine State]], Myanmar) by the [[Kingdom of Burma|Burmese]] [[king of Burma|king]] [[Bodawpaya]]. In 1784, a Burmese expeditionary force said to be 30,000 strong encountered the governor of U-rit-taung Province, General ("Saite-ké") Aung and his force of 3000.<ref>Shwe Lu Maung alias Shahnawaz Khan: The Price of Silence, A Muslim-Buddhist conflict of Myanmar - A Social Darwinist's Analysis, DewDrop Arts & Technology, 2005</ref> Although heavily outnumbered, the Arakanese force tried to fight the Burmese forces on both land and sea, but were brutally crushed. This defeat opened the route towards the inland Arakanese capital of [[Mrauk-U]], which was soon conquered, ending the independence of the [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]]. According to Arakanese lore, all{{what?|date=June 2024}}<!--in Sittwe? or throughout the kingdom?--> of the Arakanese defenders were killed.

Saittwe or Sittwe was only a small fishing village at the time of the [[British Empire|British]] [[British conquest of Burma|conquest of Burma]],{{sfnp|Phayre|1841|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9TpLoLlZ0sQC&pg=PA692 692]}} but its four poorly-maintained stupas ''Akyattaw'', ''Thingyittawdhāt'', ''Letyatalundaw'', and ''Letwetalundaw'' were later claimed to date to the 16th century and to hold various [[Relics associated with Buddha|relics]] of [[the Buddha]]: part of his rear [[jawbone]], his [[thigh]], his right [[shinbone]], and his left [[shinbone]] respectively.{{sfnp|Forchhammer|1891|p=59}}

The local defenses were stormed by the British under [[Joseph Wanton Morrison|Gen. Morrison]] in 1825 during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].{{sfnp|Smith|1882|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fnQIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA133 133]}} Despite Morrison and many of his men succumbing to [[malaria]], [[cholera]], and other tropical diseases to the point the entire settlement was abandoned for a time,{{sfnp|Smith|1882|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fnQIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA133 133]}} the port was chosen to serve as Arakan's seat of government in 1826 largely because [[Mrauk U]] was considered even more unhealthy.{{sfnp|Forchhammer|1891|p=59}} It was renamed Akyab after the town's hill and its eponymous [[Burmese pagoda|pagoda]].{{sfnp|Phayre|1841|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9TpLoLlZ0sQC&pg=PA692 692]}} The bell of the pagoda at the [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple]] south of [[Mandalay]] was removed to the basement of the Akyab courthouse until 1867.{{sfnp|Forchhammer|1891|pp=7-8}}

Under British occupation, the town grew into an important maritime base, particularly for the export of the area's rice.{{sfnp|Smith|1882|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fnQIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA132 132]}} Despite its bad reputation for disease, historical records indicate Akyab was no more dangerous to its European colonizers than other locations along the India coast.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Its population increased to 15,536 inhabitants {{c.|1865}},<ref name="EB1911"/> 33,200 {{c.|1880}}, and 31,687 by 1901, when it was the third largest port city in [[British Burma]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Akyab|first=James George|last=Scott|author-link=James George Scott|volume=1|page=458}}</ref> In the 1860s, the [[Consulate General of the United States, Kolkata|Consulate General of the United States (Kolkata)]] had a consular agency in Akyab.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://span.state.gov/wwwfspjulyaug072.pdf|title=Indo-American relations: From Emergence into Strength|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701063403/http://span.state.gov/wwwfspjulyaug072.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The four stupas along the ridge overlooking the town were rebuilt in the late 19th century very plainly and unattractively.{{sfnp|Forchhammer|1891|p=59}}

During [[World War II]], Sittwe was an important site of many battles during the [[Burma Campaign]] due to its possession of both an airfield and a deepwater port.

Sittwe is the birthplace of political monks in Myanmar. It was the birthplace of [[U Ottama]], the first monk who protested against the colonial British in Myanmar. Also, in the recent 2007 protest marches, known as the [[Saffron Revolution]], it was the monks in Sittwe who started the protest against the military government in Myanmar. Sittwe houses the Dhanyawadi Naval Base, named after the ancient Rakhine city-state of Dhanyawadi.

Since 2012, the Myanmar government has held tens of thousands of [[Rohingya]]s in camps at Sittwe. There are now some 140,000 Rohingyas living in poor condition huts with limited electricity and food. Rohingya refugees can not go out or move around and also not allowed to work outside of camp. The beach at Ohn Daw Gyi became the main departure point.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Thomas|title=Myanmar to Bar Rakhine From Fleeing, but Won't Address Their Plight|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/world/asia/myanmar-to-bar-rohingya-from-fleeing-but-wont-address-their-plight.html|access-date=12 June 2015|agency=New York Times|date=12 June 2015}}</ref>

In early 2024, as a result of the [[Myanmar civil war (2021–present)|Myanmar Civil War]], Sittwe was surrounded by [[Arakan Army]] forces, which gained control of most of Rakhine State. Sittwe and a number of other cities are the only remaining areas in the state still controlled by the [[State Administration Council|ruling military junta]]. A mass population exodus has been reported, with the only remaining avenue of escape being the airport.<ref name=":0" />

==Climate==
Sittwe's climate is classified as a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''), according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system. The city experiences a [[dry season]] from December through April, and an extraordinarily rainy [[wet season]] covering the remaining seven months. Sittwe sees average rainfall in excess of {{convert|1|m|in|-1}} per month during June, July and August. Conditions are noticeably cooler and less humid in the months of December, January and February than during the remainder of the year.

==Demographics==
The largest ethnic group in Sittwe is the [[Rakhine people]]. Alongside, there are [[Rohingya Muslims]] and some [[Bamar people|Burmese]] from other parts of the country.
The vast majority practises [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] and [[Islam]]. The Rohingya Muslim quarter used to be called Aung Mingala, until the Muslims were driven out by mobs during the 2012 riots in October.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Unforgiving history |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21565638-why-buddhists-and-muslims-rakhine-state-myanmar-are-each-others%E2%80%99-throats-unforgiving |magazine=The Economist |date=3 November 2012}}</ref> It is difficult to document the number of Rohingya who remain in the Internally Displaced Persons camps as the so-called "illegal people" were not permitted to register for the national census and the government refuses to address this minority Rohingya ethnic group by name.

[[Human Rights Watch]], Fortify Rights, Amnesty International and the UN Special Rapporteur have documented the spread of orchestrated anti-Muslim violence with the permission (and sometimes the direct involvement of) government and military authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/reports/patterns-of-anti-muslim-violence-in-burma.html|title = Physicians for Human Rights - Patterns of Anti-Muslim Violence in Burma}}</ref>

==Economy==
In February 2007, India announced a plan to develop the port under the [[Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project]], which would enable ocean access from Indian north-eastern states, so called "Seven sisters", like [[Mizoram]], via the Kaladan River.<ref>{{cite news |title=India to develop Myanmar port to benefit northeast |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1918666,0002.htm |newspaper=Hindustan Times |agency=Press Trust of India |date=February 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205105234/http://hindustantimes.com/news/181_1918666,0002.htm |archive-date=February 5, 2007}}</ref> Sittwe's citizenry, especially Buddhist monks, have participated in the [[2007 Burmese anti-government protests]].

In October 2011, as part of a recent bilateral trade deal signed by Myanmar and India, the two countries pledged a US$120 million port and multimodal investment to complete the infrastructure linking Indian north-eastern provinces to Sittwe overland via India's Mizoram by 2013.

The port of Sittwe will undergo extensive dredging and the construction of new berthing terminals. Once operational it will offer direct passage to enable Burmese and Indian shippers to pick up mainline services to and from [[Kolkata]]. The two countries also pledged to double bilateral trade to US$3 billion by 2015 by reducing trade tariffs.

==Attractions==
