==History==
Nagahama is part of ancient  [[Ōmi Province]] and has been settled since at least the [[Yayoi period]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was contested between the [[Kyogoku clan]], [[Azai clan]] and [[Asakura clan]]. The city center was developed and renamed by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] when Hideyoshi moved the center of his administration from [[Odani Castle]]. [[Kunitomo]] ([[:ja:国友|国友]]), the northeast of the city center, had been known for the production of [[arquebus]]es and guns since 1544. The settlement was originally called '''Imahama''' (今濱), but  Hideyoshi renamed it "Nagahama", taking one ''[[kanji]]'' from the name of his overlord, [[Oda Nobunaga]]. It is not related to the area of the same name in [[Fukuoka|Fukuoka City]] and [[Nagahama, Ehime|same name town]] in [[Ehime Prefecture]]. In the [[Edo period]], it was largely under the control of [[Hikone Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]; however, the ''[[jin'ya]]'' of [[Ōmi-Miyagawa Domain]], a 13,000 ''[[koku]]'' [[han system|feudal holding]] under a cadet branch of the [[Hotta clan]] was located in what is now southeastern Nagahama. After the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Nagahama was established within [[Sakata District, Shiga]] with the creation of the modern municipalities system. 

On April 1, 1943, Nagahama annexed the neighboring villages of Kamiteru, Rokusho, Minamigori, Kitagori, Nishikuroda and Kanda to form the city of Nagahama. On February 13, 2006, the towns of [[Azai, Shiga|Azai]] and [[Biwa, Shiga|Biwa]] (both from [[Higashiazai District, Shiga|Higashiazai District]]) were merged into Nagahama. On January 1, 2010, the towns of [[Kohoku, Shiga|Kohoku]] and [[Torahime, Shiga|Torahime]] (both from Higashiazai District), and the towns of [[Kinomoto, Shiga|Kinomoto]], [[Nishiazai, Shiga|Nishiazai]], [[Takatsuki, Shiga|Takatsuki]] and [[Yogo, Shiga|Yogo]] (all from [[Ika District, Shiga|Ika District]]) were merged into Nagahama. Both districts were thereby dissolved as a result of this merger.<ref name="Plannedmerge">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/chubu/20.htm |title=市町村合併情報 長野県 ＜国土地理協会＞ |access-date=2008-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418104711/http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/chubu/20.htm |archive-date=2008-04-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The current city thus consists of areas once within three former districts; [[Sakata District, Shiga|Sakata District]], [[Higashiazai District, Shiga|Higashiazai District]] and [[Ika District, Shiga|Ika District]].

==Government==
Nagahama has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 26 members. Nagahama contributes four members to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Shiga 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The economy of Nagahama is centered on agriculture and light manufacturing. 

==Education==
Nagahama has 23 public elementary schools and ten public middle schools and two combined elementary/middle schools operated by the city government. There are five public high schools operated by the Shiga Prefectural Department of Education. The prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped.
