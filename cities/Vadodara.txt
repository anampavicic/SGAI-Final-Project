'''Vadodara''' ({{IPA|gu|ʋəˈɽodɾɑ|lang|Vadodarapronun.flac}}) formerly, '''Baroda''', is a major city in the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Gujarat]]. It serves as the administrative headquarters of the [[Vadodara district]] and is situated on the banks of the [[Vishwamitri River]], {{convert|141|km|abbr=on}} from the state capital of [[Gandhinagar]]. The railway line and [[National Highway 8 (India, old numbering)|National Highway 8]], which connect [[Delhi]] with [[Mumbai]], pass through Vadodara. The city is named for its abundance of [[banyan]] (''vad'') trees. Vadodara is also locally referred to as the ''Sanskrutik Nagari'' ({{Translation|'Cultural City'}}) and ''Kala Nagari'' ({{Translation|'City of Art'}})<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baroda.com/aboutvadodara.php|title=About Vadodara|website=www.baroda.com|access-date=2019-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411052514/http://www.baroda.com/aboutvadodara.php|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> of India.

The city is prominent for landmarks such as the [[Laxmi Vilas Palace, Vadodara|Laxmi Vilas Palace]], which served as the residence of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] royal [[Gaekwad dynasty]] that ruled over [[Baroda State]]. It is also the home of the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://vmc.gov.in|title= Vadodara Municipal Corporation}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2022}}
[[File:Street scene in Baroda (c. 1880).jpg|thumb|left|Street scene in Baroda (''circa'' 1880)]]
The city once was called Chandanavati after the rule of Raja Chandan of the Dodiya Rajputis. The capital was also known as Virakshetra (Land of Warriors). Later, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodará, and according to tradition, is a corrupt form of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vatodara'', meaning "in the belly of the banyan tree". It is, as of 2009, almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; early English travelers and merchants of the 15th century mention the town as Baroda,<ref  name=painting>{{cite web|date=1781|work=Collect Britain, British Library|title=Hand Painting of Bridge over the River Vishwamitri, near Brodera|url=http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|access-date=3 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928134532/http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=live}}
</ref> and it is from this, that the name Baroda is derived; in 1974 (well after independence), the official name of the city was changed to Vadodara.

==History==
===Prehistory===
At [[Akota]], now a suburb of Vadodara, excavations have found rich [[microlith]] deposits, providing early evidence of habitation in the area. These prehistoric people took part in hunting and fishing and lived no later than 1000 BCE.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 79 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979">{{cite book |last1=Rajyagor |first1=S.B. |title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Vadodara |date=1979 |publisher=Directorate of Government Printing, Stationery, and Publications |location=Ahmadabad |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.csl.3201 |access-date=4 May 2023}}</ref>{{rp|79}}

===First millennium CE===
By the first centuries CE, Akota was the site of a commercial town with far-reaching trade links.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 81 --> Known in antiquity as ''Aṅkoṭṭaka'', it had well-built houses made from burnt bricks.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 82 --> Two re-struck coins of the early [[Western Satraps]] have been found here, along with artifacts possibly of Greco-Roman origin.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 80-1 --> A [[Gupta dynasty|Gupta]]-era coin has also been found here.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 81 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|80–2}}

Akota flourished under the [[Maitraka dynasty]], although it experienced periodic severe flooding. A huge hoard of Jain bronzes, largely dating from this period, was found at Akota's old site, indicating that the city was a centre of [[Jainism]]. The bronzes include images of various [[tirthankara]]s as well as an elephant-shaped incense burner. Many of them have inscriptions that have been used to indicate when they were made.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 82-3 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|82–3}}

In the 6th century, the town's inhabitants shifted away from the river to a new site near Akota's modern centre. At Kothi, which also now forms part of Vadodara, evidence of habitation also first emerges during this period.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 82 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|82}}

An early mention of Vadodara itself is in an 812 [[copper-plate grant]] of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]]. It records Karka Suvarṇavasha, second ruler of [[Branches of Rashtrakuta dynasty|the Lata branch of the Rashtrakutas]], giving the village of ''Vaḍapadraka'', in the province of Aṅkoṭṭaka and identified with present-day Vadodara, to a Brahmin from [[Valabhi]].<!-- Rajyagor, p. 83 --> Meanwhile, Akota continued to flourish during this period.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 84 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|83–4}}

===Chaulukya period: from village to city===
By the 11th century, under the [[Chaulukya dynasty]], Vadodara appears to have gained in importance. A plate dated to 1077 mentions a battle on the bank of the Vishvamitri river in the [[vishaya]] of ''Vaṭapadraka'', which had evidently replaced the earlier province of Aṅkoṭṭaka. The Akota bronzes continue until the 11th century but cease thereafter. The main centre of Jainism in the area shifted to Vadodara.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 85 --> By this period, Vadodara is referred to as a ''pura'', or city, rather than just a village.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 86 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|85–6}}

A manuscript of the [[Panchavastuka]] written at Vadodara in 1123 indicates that the province of [[Lata (region)|Lāṭa]] was then governed by [[Santūka]], a minister of the Chaulukya king [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]]. At some point, Santūka organised a [[rathayatra]], or chariot procession, at ''Vaṭapadraka''. Several other manuscripts from Vadodara are known from this period, including a [[Prakrit]] work composed by Chandraprabhasuri in 1128 along with two copies of Jain works made in 1156 and 1168 respectively. Another manuscript, although copied at [[Dabhoi]], was written by a scribe named Vosari whose father was a [[pandit]] named Kesava who came from Vadodara.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 85-6 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|85–6}}

During this period, merchants from Vadodara contributed to the temples at the Chaulukya capital of [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]. At some point, the minister [[Tejpal]], returning from a victory at [[Godhra]], stopped at Vadodara for several days and renovated the local shrine of [[Parshvanatha]]. Around 1264, shrines to [[Mahavira]] and [[Adishvara]] were built at Vadodara by one Pethad Shah.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 86 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|86}}

===Delhi Sultanate===
Under the [[Delhi Sultanate]], Vadodara was home to a group of Afghan amirs known collectively as the ''Amir-i Sadgan'', or "the nobles of the hundred", because each one commanded a force of 100 cavalry. In 1344, during the reign of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], they revolted. Led by one Qazi Jalal, they defeated Muqbil, the sultan's main deputy in Gujarat, in a decisive battle near Dabhoi. They went on to occupy a large territory stretching from [[Kadi, Gujarat|Kadi]] in the north to [[Bharuch]] in the south, and from [[Khambhat]] in the west to the hill country in the east. In 1345, Muhammad bin Tughluq led an army to Gujarat to put down the rebellion and, after initially camping at [[Pandu Mewas]], defeated them in battle at Bharuch.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 87-9 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|87–9}}

===Gujarat Sultanate===
[[Muzaffar Shah I]], founder of the [[Gujarat Sultanate]], appointed his son Firuz Khan as governor of Vadodara at some point. After Muzaffar Shah's death in 1411, he was succeeded by his grandson [[Ahmad Shah I]] (Firuz's nephew). Firuz immediately laid claim to the throne. Because the sultanate's central authority in central and southern Gujarat was weak at this point, Firuz had little trouble assembling an army at Vadodara. He then marched to [[Nadiad]] and then to Bharuch, which he seized by force. Ultimately, the rebellion dissipated without a pitched battle: internal tensions had already arisen among Firuz Khan's main allies, and when Ahmad Shah offered them amnesty in return for standing down, they readily complied. Firuz Khan was forgiven and given [[Navsari]] as a [[jagir]], thus giving up his position as governor of Vadodara.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 90 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|90}}

In 1451, Vadodara was sacked by troops under [[Mahmud Khalji]], ruler of the [[Malwa Sultanate]]. Later, during the reign of [[Mahmud Begada]], a major re-foundation of Vadodara took place. A new city called ''Daulatabad'' was built, close to the old site. The Muslim name evidently did not stick, but the city itself did, and this new foundation became the basis for the modern city of Vadodara. A later atlas by [[John Ogilby]] refers to people moving from the old town to the new one.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 92 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|92}}

===Mughal Empire===
After [[Akbar]] conquered Gujarat in 1573, he gave Vadodara to one [[Nawab Aurang Khan]]. There was an administrative reform under Akbar's reign, and Raja [[Todar Mal]] conducted a land survey of parts of Gujarat. Vadodara, however, does not seem to have been included in this survey.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 93-4 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|93–4}}

In the late 1600s, Gujarat was increasingly attacked by Maratha and Koli raids. One raid, by the Kolis, hit Vadodara in 1705; they looted the city for two days.<!-- Rajyagor, p. 94-5 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1979"/>{{rp|94–5}}

==Geography==
Vadodara is located at {{coord|22.30|N|73.19|E|}} in western India at an elevation of {{convert|39|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. It is the 10th-largest city in India with an area of {{convert|400|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of 3.5 million, according to the 2010–11 census. The city sits on the banks of the [[Vishwamitri River]], in central Gujarat. The Vishwamitri frequently dries up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water. The city is located on the fertile plain between the [[Mahi River|Mahi]] and [[Narmada River]]s. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the cosmopolis falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-III]], on a scale of I to V (in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes).<ref name=hazardprofile>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdma.org/hazard/eq/200_year.jpg |title=Gujarat Earthquake Hazard Risk Zone |access-date=23 August 2006 |publisher=Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929061637/http://www.gsdma.org/hazard/eq/200_year.jpg |archive-date=29 September 2007 }}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Kirti Mandir, Vadadora (Baroda) - India (3-2) (8147894472).jpg|thumb|left|Kirti Mandir]]
Vadodara features a borderline [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') that despite the roughly {{convert|950|mm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}} of rain that the city receives annually is due to the area's high [[potential evapotranspiration]] very close to being classified as a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''). There are three main seasons: summer, [[monsoon]] and winter. Aside from the monsoon season, the climate is dry. The weather is hot during March to July, when the average maximum is {{convert|39|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, and the average minimum is {{convert|24|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}. From November to February, the average maximum temperature is {{convert|30|°C|disp=or}}, the average minimum is {{convert|15|°C|disp=or}}, and the climate is extremely dry. Cold northerly winds are responsible for mildly chilly days in January. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. The average rainfall is {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on}}, but infrequent, torrential rains cause the river to flood<ref name="Weatherbase">{{cite web|title=Baroda, India (2~35 kilometers)|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=74724&units=metric|access-date=6 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211144022/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=74724&units=metric|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=live}}{{better source needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> like the [[2005 Gujarat Flood|2005 Gujarat flood]] or the [[2008 Indian floods]], which were catastrophic.<ref name="floods">{{cite web | url=http://www.iahv.org/in-en/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Gujarat-Floods-2005-Report.pdf | title=Gujarat Floods 2005: Project Report | publisher=International Association for Human Values and the Art of Living | date=2005 | access-date=2 November 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112001510/http://www.iahv.org/in-en/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Gujarat-Floods-2005-Report.pdf | archive-date=12 January 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Urban planning ===
The two main institutions involved in planning and development in Vadodara are VMSS and the Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA). The responsibilities of both these agencies are demarcated clearly not only physically but also functionally. The governing acts for both institutions differ. The principal responsibility of VUDA is to ensure a holistic development of the Vadodara agglomeration covering an area of {{convert|714.56|km2|abbr=on}},<ref name="zone" /> whereas VMSS is involved in the development of area of {{convert|235|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="zone" />

Vadodara's population grew the fastest during the decade between 1961 and 1971.<!-- Vasudeva 2023, p. 652 -->  The Vadodara Municipal Corporation drew up the first official urban plan for the city's growth in 1970, the Vadodara Development Plan.<!-- Vasudeva 2023, p. 652 -->  The VUDA was formed in 1980.<!-- Vasudeva 2023, p. 652 --><ref name="Vasudeva 2023"/>{{rp|652}} The second Development Plan, developed in 1984, included decentralising the city's infrastructure. During the mid-late 70s early 80s, development on the city's outskirts focused on building cheap, low-income housing for industrial workers.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> By the 1990s, the focus had shifted to mixed-density, "self-sustainable settlements" in peri-urban areas, especially on the west and southwest sides of town.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --><ref name="Vasudeva 2021"/>{{rp|45}} Farmland was purchased from nearby villages to provide space for these new developments, which caused a large drop in cultivated acreage and overall agricultural produce in the area.<!-- Vasudeva 2023, p. 652 --><ref name="Vasudeva 2023"/>{{rp|652}}

Initially, major industrial development happened on the city's north side; the east side also saw plenty of development because of its location near the old city core.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> The south and west were relatively less populated in comparison.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --><ref name="Vasudeva 2021"/>{{rp|45}}

Various unplanned slum areas have been formed by rapid immigration from rural areas that outpaced formal city planning.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> These slum areas consist largely of temporary (''kachcha'') structures with communal toilets or none at all.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> They are often found in less-desired areas along river banks and [[nullah|nallahs]] or in other low-lying spots.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> Sanitation in these developments is generally poor.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --><ref name="Vasudeva 2021"/>{{rp|45}}

A low of relatively lower-income, blue-collar workers live in industrial housing developments on Vadodara's outskirts.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> Economically Weaker Section (EWS) housing and slums are located especially on the northwest, northeast, and east sides of the city.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> In recent decades (as of 2021), major industrial development has taken place along the [[NH-8]] corridor.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --> Religious institutions like temples and [[ashram]]s have especially developed on the east side of town, while the [[Transport Nagar, Vadodara|Transport Nagar]] development is located on the northeast.<!-- Vasudeva 2021, p. 45 --><ref name="Vasudeva 2021"/>{{rp|45}}
