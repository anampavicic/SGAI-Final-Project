==History==
{{main|Adal Sultanate|Somali aristocratic and court titles}}
[[File:Qorgab Valley.jpg|thumb|right|Qorgab Valley outside Borama]]

As with several nearby towns such as [[Amud]], numerous archaeological finds have been discovered in the Borama area that point to an eventful past. The latter include ancient remains of [[tomb]]s, [[house]]s and [[mosque]]s, in addition to sherds of Oriental wares, particularly [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]]. The artefacts and structures date from various historical periods, ranging from the 12th through to the 18th centuries. Most, however, are from the 15th and 16th centuries, a time of great commercial activity in the region that is associated with the medieval [[Adal Sultanate]].<ref name="Eoa">Bernard Samuel Myers, ed., ''Encyclopedia of World Art'', Volume 13, (McGraw-Hill: 1959), p.xcii.</ref>

Excavations in the late 1800s and early 1900s at over fourteen sites in the vicinity of Borama unearthed, among other things, coins identified as having been derived from [[Qaitbay|Kait Bey]], the eighteenth [[Burji dynasty|Burji]] [[Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] of [[Egypt]]. Most of these finds were sent to the [[British Museum]] for preservation shortly after their discovery.<ref name="Tgj">Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain), ''The Geographical Journal'', Volume 87, (Royal Geographical Society: 1936), p.301.</ref>

In the first half of the 20th century, Borama formed a part of the [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]]. It was later given district status in 1925.

In 1933, Sheikh [[Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur]], a [[Qur'an]]ic teacher and son of Borama's ''[[qadi]]'' (judge), devised a new orthography for transcribing the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] [[Somali language]]. A quite accurate phonetic [[List of writing systems|writing system]], this [[Borama script]] was principally used by Nuur, his circle of associates in the city and some of the merchants in control of trade in Zeila and Borama. Students of Sheikh Nuur were also trained in the use of this script.  .<ref name="Laitin">David D.

In the post-[[Independence Day (Somalia)|independence]] period, Borama was administered as part of the official [[Awdal]] administrative region of Somalia. During the [[Ethio-Somali War|Ogaden War]] in the late 1970s, Borama was one of several northern cities aerially bombarded by Ethiopian forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mohamoud |first1=Abdulkadir |title=The Night SNM Fighters came to Hargeisa |url=http://www.wardheernews.com/Articles_10/Oct/06_snm_hargeisa_partII_abdulkadir.html |website=Warheernews |access-date=3 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528045317/http://www.wardheernews.com/Articles_10/Oct/06_snm_hargeisa_partII_abdulkadir.html |archive-date=28 May 2012 }}</ref>

Federico Battera (2005) states about the [[Awdal]] Region:
<blockquote>"Awdal is mainly inhabited by the Gadabuursi confederation of clans."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Battera |first1=Federico |others=Walter Dostal, Wolfgang Kraus (ed.)  |title=Shattering Tradition: Custom, Law and the Individual in the Muslim Mediterranean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4AAAwAAQBAJ&q=gadabuursi+awdal&pg=PA296|access-date=2010-03-18 |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A UN report published by Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (1999), states concerning [[Awdal]]:
<blockquote>"The Gadabuursi clan dominates Awdal region. As a result, regional politics in Awdal is almost synonymous with Gadabuursi internal clan affairs."<ref name="Somaliland p. 5"/></blockquote>

Roland Marchal (1997) states that numerically, the [[Gadabuursi]] are the predominant inhabitants of the [[Awdal]] Region:
<blockquote>"The Gadabuursi's numerical predominance in Awdal virtually ensures that Gadabuursi interests drive the politics of the region."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeuSqpJeoEoC&q=Gadabuursi  |title= United Nations Development Office for Somalia: Studies on Governance: Awdal Region|year=1997|df=dmy-all|quote=The Gadabuursi's numerical predominance in Awdal virtually ensures that Gadabuursi interests drive the politics of the region.|last1= Marchal|first1= Roland}}</ref></blockquote>

Marleen Renders and Ulf Terlinden (2010) both state that the [[Gadabuursi]] almost exclusively inhabit the [[Awdal]] Region:
<blockquote>"Awdal in western Somaliland is situated between Djibouti, Ethiopia, and the Issaq-populated mainland of Somaliland.
