Indigenous settlement of Vancouver began more than 10,000 years ago and included the [[Squamish people|Squamish]], [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam]], and [[Tsleil-Waututh First Nation|Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard)]] peoples. The beginnings of the modern city, which was originally named [[Gastown]], grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of [[Hastings Mill]] that was built on July 1, 1867, and owned by proprietor [[John Deighton|Gassy Jack]]. The Gastown steam clock marks the original site. Gastown then formally registered as a [[townsite]] dubbed [[Granville, British Columbia|Granville]], [[Burrard Inlet]]. The city was renamed "Vancouver" in 1886 through a deal with the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. The city's large natural seaport on the [[Pacific Ocean]] became a vital link in the trade between [[Asia-Pacific]], [[East Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[Eastern Canada]].<ref name="Morley">{{cite book |last=Morley |first=A. |year=1974 |title=Vancouver, from milltown to metropolis |lccn=64026114 |location=Vancouver |publisher=Mitchell Press}}</ref><ref name="STEV">{{Cite book |last=Norris |first=John M. |lccn=72170963 |title=Strangers Entertained |publisher=Vancouver, British Columbia Centennial '71 Committee |year=1971}}</ref>

The city takes its name from [[George Vancouver]], who explored the inner harbour of [[Burrard Inlet]] in 1792 and gave various places British names.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/vancouver_george_4E.html |title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography: George Vancouver |website=biography.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203064456/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/vancouver_george_4E.html |archive-date=February 3, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The family name "Vancouver" itself originates from the Dutch "van Coevorden", denoting somebody from the city of [[Coevorden]], Netherlands.

It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp, who had begun logging in the [[Port Alberni]] area, first attempted to run a mill at [[Brockton Point]], but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to a point near the foot of Dunlevy Street. This mill, known as the [[Hastings Mill]], became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed.

In 1870, the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–1871)|colonial government]] surveyed the settlement and laid out a [[townsite]], renamed "[[Granville, British Columbia|Granville]]" in honour of the then–British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]].

===Ecology===
The vegetation in the Vancouver area was originally [[temperate rainforest]], consisting of [[conifer]]s with scattered pockets of maple and alder and large areas of swampland (even in upland areas, due to poor drainage).<ref>{{cite web |year=2009 |title=Stanley Park History |url=http://vancouver.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/history.htm |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810102612/http://vancouver.ca/parks/parks/stanley/history.htm |archive-date=August 10, 2011 |access-date=December 1, 2009 |publisher=City of Vancouver}}</ref> The conifers were a typical coastal British Columbia mix of [[Douglas fir]], [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]] and [[Tsuga heterophylla|western hemlock]].<ref>{{cite web |title="Lower Mainland Ecoregion": Narrative Descriptions of Terrestrial Ecozones and Ecoregions of Canada (#196) |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/Nardesc/Region.cfm?region=196 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127133028/http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/Nardesc/Region.cfm?region=196 |archive-date=January 27, 2007 |publisher=Environment Canada |access-date=December 4, 2009}}</ref> The area is thought to have had the largest trees of these species on the [[British Columbia Coast]].

The largest trees in Vancouver's old-growth forest were in the [[Gastown]] area, where the first logging occurred and on the southern slopes of [[False Creek]] and English Bay, especially around [[Jericho Beach]]. The forest in Stanley Park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s, and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as [[Logging#Springboards|springboard notches]] can still be seen there.<ref>{{cite web |year=2009 |title=Stanley Park: Forest – Monument Trees |url=http://vancouver.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/nature.htm |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201164108/http://vancouver.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/nature.htm |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |access-date=December 1, 2009 |publisher=City of Vancouver}}</ref>

Many plants and trees growing throughout Vancouver and the [[Lower Mainland]] were imported from other parts of the continent and points across the Pacific. Examples include the [[araucaria araucana|monkey puzzle tree]], the [[Acer palmatum|Japanese maple]] and various flowering exotics, such as [[magnolia]]s, [[azalea]]s and [[rhododendron]]s. Some species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe have grown to immense sizes. The native [[Acer glabrum|Douglas maple]] can also attain a tremendous size. Many of the city's streets are lined with flowering varieties of [[Cherry blossom|Japanese cherry]] trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of Japan. These flower for several weeks in early spring each year, an occasion celebrated by the [[Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival]]. Other streets are lined with flowering chestnut, [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse chestnut]] and other decorative shade trees.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.vcbf.ca/history |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503001521/http://www.vcbf.ca/history |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |publisher=Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival |year=2009 |access-date=November 30, 2009}}</ref>

=== Homelessness ===
{{Main|Homelessness in Vancouver}}
Homelessness is a significant and persistent issue in Vancouver. A 2019 count found that at least 2,223 people in the city were experiencing homelessness, the highest number recorded since counts began in 2005. Of those surveyed, 28 percent reported having no physical shelter. Indigenous people accounted for 39 percent of all respondents. Three-fifths of respondents said at least two health concerns, and 67 percent said an addiction to at least one substance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vancouver Homeless Count 2019 |publisher=City of Vancouver |date=2019 |url=https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/vancouver-homeless-count-2019-final-report.pdf |access-date=July 2, 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709182131/https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/vancouver-homeless-count-2019-final-report.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Government and politics of Vancouver}}
[[File:Vancouver_neighbourhoods.jpg|thumb|Map of the 22 official neighbourhoods of Vancouver]]
Vancouver, unlike other British Columbia municipalities, is [[Local government in Canada|incorporated]] under the ''[[Vancouver Charter]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/vanch_00 |title=Vancouver Charter |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=November 18, 2009 |access-date=November 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165944/http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/vanch_00 |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The legislation, passed in 1953, supersedes the ''Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921'' and grants the city more and different powers than other communities possess under British Columbia's ''Municipalities Act''.

The civic government was dominated by the centre-right [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA) since [[World War II]], albeit with some significant centre-left interludes until 2008.<ref name="GVB" /> The NPA fractured over the issue of [[narcotic|drug]] policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE) on a [[harm reduction]] platform. Subsequently, North America's only legal safe injection site at the time, [[Insite]], was opened for the significant number of intravenous heroin users in the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15130282 |title=Vancouver Insite drug-injection facility can stay open |work=BBC News |date=September 30, 2011 |access-date=September 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151624/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15130282 |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Vancouver is governed by the eleven-member [[Vancouver City Council]], a nine-member [[Vancouver School Board|School Board]], and a seven-member [[Vancouver Park Board|Park Board]], all of whom serve four-year terms. Unusually for a city of Vancouver's size, all municipal elections are on an [[at-large]] basis. Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along [[Conservatism in Canada|conservative]] or [[Liberalism in Canada|liberal]] lines. In contrast, the city's eastern side has voted along [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] lines.<ref>{{cite thesis |first=Andrea Barbara |last=Smith |title=The Origins of the NPA: A Study in Vancouver Politics |type=MA |publisher=University of British Columbia |date=1981}}</ref> This was reaffirmed with the results of the [[2005 British Columbia general election|2005 provincial election]] and the [[Canadian federal election results in Greater Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast|2006 federal election]].
[[File:City Hall (6868486297).jpg|thumb|Opened in 1936, [[Vancouver City Hall]] is home to [[Vancouver City Council]].]]
Though polarized, a political [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] has emerged in Vancouver around several issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of [[rapid transit]] as opposed to a freeway system, a harm-reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the [[political spectrum]] in Vancouver.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Conflicts and consensus in Vancouver's political history |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/conflicts-and-consensus-in-vancouvers-political-history |access-date=March 3, 2022 |newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun]] |archive-date=October 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231018184042/https://vancouversun.com/news/conflicts-and-consensus-in-vancouvers-political-history |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[2008 Vancouver municipal election|2008 municipal election]] campaign, NPA incumbent mayor [[Sam Sullivan]] was ousted as mayoral candidate by the party in a close vote, which instated Peter Ladner as the new mayoral candidate for the NPA. [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]], a former MLA for [[Vancouver-Fairview]] and head of [[Happy Planet]], was the mayoral candidate for Vision Vancouver, the other main contender.

The City of Vancouver is a member of [[Metro Vancouver]], which provides sustainable regional services<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/strategic-directions/Pages/default.aspx |title=Board Strategic Plan |publisher=metrovancouver |access-date=August 23, 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709190407/http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/strategic-directions/Pages/default.aspx |url-status=live}}</ref> to the [[Greater Vancouver]] area. The city electrical grid is serviced by [[BC Hydro]], which claims 97.8% of the energy it generates is clean owing to the extensive use of [[hydroelectric]] power generation.<ref>{{cite web |title=BC Hydro quick facts |url=https://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/BCHydro/customer-portal/documents/corporate/accountability-reports/financial-reports/annual-reports/BCHydro-Quick-Facts-20190331.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210627210808/https://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/BCHydro/customer-portal/documents/corporate/accountability-reports/financial-reports/annual-reports/BCHydro-Quick-Facts-20190331.pdf |archive-date=June 27, 2021 |access-date=August 23, 2021 |publisher=[[BC Hydro]]}}</ref> The City of Vancouver is the greenest city in Canada according to an independent ongoing urban ecological footprint study.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://greenscore.eco/city_index_scoreboard.html |title=Comprehensively Answers How green is my city? |website=greenscore.eco |access-date=August 23, 2021 |archive-date=August 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210819034508/https://greenscore.eco/city_index_scoreboard.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Vancouver's greenest city action plan|Greenest City action plan]] (GCAP) is a City of Vancouver urban sustainability initiative. Its primary mission was to ensure Vancouver would become the greenest city in the world by 2020. The GCAP originated based on the 2009 work of the Greenest City Action Team, a committee co-chaired by Vancouver mayor [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada's greenest mayor |url=https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/leadership/canadas-greenest-mayor-14321016/ |last=Runnalls |first=Jeremy |publisher=Corporate Knights |date=May 20, 2015 |access-date=August 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817111720/https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/leadership/canadas-greenest-mayor-14321016/ |archive-date=August 17, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The GCAP was approved by Vancouver city council in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Greenest City Action Plan |url=https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/greenest-city-action-plan.aspx |publisher=City of Vancouver |access-date=August 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723194605/https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/greenest-city-action-plan.aspx |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2018, the [[Zero Waste]] 2040 Strategy was passed<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/vancouver-votes-to-ban-single-use-straws-foam-cups-and-take-out-containers-1.3933955 |title=Vancouver votes to ban single-use straws, foam cups and take-out containers |date=May 17, 2018 |work=[[CTV News]] |access-date=July 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729081424/https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/vancouver-votes-to-ban-single-use-straws-foam-cups-and-take-out-containers-1.3933955 |archive-date=July 29, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city began work the same year on decreasing the amount of single-use items distributed in the city. It intends to ban these items by 2021 if businesses do not meet reduction targets. As part of the plan, a ban on [[drinking straw|plastic straws]], [[polystyrene]] food packaging and free shopping bags was to go into effect in mid-2019.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-to-be-first-major-canadian-city-to-ban-plastic-straws/ |title=Vancouver to be first major Canadian city to ban plastic straws |last=Woods |first=Melanie |date=May 17, 2018 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=July 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810193203/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-to-be-first-major-canadian-city-to-ban-plastic-straws/ |archive-date=August 10, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2022, the city council passed a regulation mandating that businesses charge a $0.25 fee on single-use cups. This decision was criticized because the fees stayed within the business and were not re-invested in city-wide environmental efforts. On March 28, 2023, the council enacted a by-law that repealed all single-use cup fees.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/vancouvers-single-use-cup-fee-to-be-dropped-may-1 |title=Vancouver's single-use cup fee to be dropped May 1 |date=March 28, 2023 |work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |access-date=December 15, 2023 |archive-date=March 29, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230329052950/https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/vancouvers-single-use-cup-fee-to-be-dropped-may-1 |url-status=live }}</ref>
