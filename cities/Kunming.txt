Kunming is at an altitude of {{convert|1900|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and a [[latitude]] just north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and is situated in the middle of the [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau]].  Kunming is the fourth most populous city in [[Western China]], after [[Chongqing]], [[Chengdu]], and [[Xi'an]], and the third most populous city in [[Southwestern China]] after Chongqing and Chengdu. As of the 2020 census, Kunming had a total population of 8,460,088 inhabitants, of whom 5,604,310 lived in its built-up (or metro) area made of all urban districts except [[Jinning, Kunming|Jinning]].

Kunming consists of an old, previously walled city, a modern commercial district, residential zones, and university areas. The city is also one of the major centers for scientific research and education in [[Southwestern China]]. As of 2023, it was listed among the top 125 [[List of cities by scientific output|cities in the world by scientific research output]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Leading 200 science cities 2023{{!}} {{!}} Supplements {{!}} Nature Index |url=https://www.nature.com/nature-index/supplements/nature-index-2023-science-cities/tables/overall |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=www.nature.com}}</ref> The city has an [[Yunnan Astronomical Observatory|astronomical observatory]], and its [[List of universities and colleges in Yunnan|institutions of higher learning]] include [[Yunnan University]], [[Kunming University of Science and Technology]], [[Yunnan University of Finance and Economics]], [[Kunming Medical University]], [[Yunnan Normal University]], [[Yunnan Agricultural University]] and [[Southwest Forestry University]]. Kunming is also home to the [[Golden Temple Park|Golden Temple]], China's largest bronze temple dating from the Ming dynasty.

Kunming is a major economic center in Western China. The city's economic importance derives from its geographical position, as it shares a border with various [[Southeast Asia]]n countries, serving them as a transportation hub in Southwest China, linking by rail to [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]], and by road to [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. This positioning also makes the city an important commercial center of trade in the region. The city also acts as a gateway to [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]], the [[Kunming Changshui International Airport]] is one of the top 40-[[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest airports]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 2021 |title=2020 Airport Traffic Report |url=https://www.panynj.gov/content/dam/airports/statistics/statistics-general-info/annual-atr/ATR_2020.pdf |access-date=26 Sep 2021 |publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] |page=30 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.panynj.gov/content/dam/airports/statistics/statistics-general-info/annual-atr/ATR2019.pdf |title=2019 Annual Airport Traffic Report |publisher=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. |year=2020 |location=United States}}</ref> As of 2024, the city is also home to six consulates from ASEAN countries.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |title=Foreign consulates in Kunming |url=https://www.embassypages.com/city/kunming |access-date=2024-06-11 |website=www.embassypages.com |language=en}}</ref>

Kunming has a nearly 2,400-year history, but its modern prosperity dates only to 1910, when the railway from [[Hanoi]] was built. The city has continued to develop rapidly under China's modernization efforts. Kunming was designated a special tourism center and, as such, has experienced a proliferation of [[high-rise]]s and [[luxury hotel]]s.

== Etymology ==
The name "Kunming" evolved from the name of an ancient ethnic group named ''[[Kunming Yi]]'' or ''Kunming Barbarian'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=昆明夷}}), which was a branch of the [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]]-[[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] people. The ''Kunming Yi'' lived in the neighbouring region of [[Erhai Lake]] during the [[Western Han]] dynasty. The Han dynasty incorporated the territory of the [[Dian Kingdom]] and set up a commandery called [[Yizhou (Southwest China)|Yizhou]] in 109 BC; the Han dynasty also incorporated the ''Kunming Yi'' into Yizhou Commandery soon after. Therefore, ''Kunming Yi'' expanded east to the [[Lake Dian]] area later. "Kunming" has acted as a place name since the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, but the reference was not clear because this ethnicity occupied a large region. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], the central government set up "Kunming County" in modern Kunming; the name "Kunming" has continued to this day.<ref>{{cite journal |author=《云南各民族历史大事概略》编写组古代史组 |date=1975 |title=云南历史上几个族名、地名的由来和演变 |trans-title=The origin and the evolvement of some ethnic names and the place names in the history of Yunnan |url=https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&dbname=CJFD7984&filename=SXZX197506018&v=LiQBcpsSMQHM%25mmd2BpKxMw6bGJCWyQMamowpSWFPlERlcIVgTKcafzrh9Lqy4Yq4YyIF |language=zh |journal=思想战线 (Thinking) |issue=6 |pages=83–86 }}</ref>

A 2009 research paper proposes that the name "Kunming" of ''Kunming Yi'' is a [[cognate]] word of "[[Khmer people|Khmer]]" and "[[Khmu people|Khmu]]" that originally meant "people".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tu |first=Liang-jun |date=2009 |title="昆明"得名来源考 |trans-title=The Original Meaning of the Word "昆明" |url=https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&dbname=CJFD2009&filename=YNSF200906019&v=jcgliN2MimtHyl9dnJmaU1IlTxeHbX0L7NyTvgfcjQWrAbTgO57zz3UKpuA0XIC%25mmd2B |language=zh |journal=Journal of Yunnan Normal University (Humanities and Social Sciences Edition) |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=124–131 }}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|History of Yunnan}}

=== Early history ===

Kunming long profited from its position on the caravan route through to [[Southeast Asia]], India and [[Tibet]]. Early townships on the southern edge of [[Dian Lake|Lake Dian]] (outside the contemporary city perimeter) can be dated back to 279 BC, although they have been long lost to history. Early settlements in the area around Lake Dian date back to [[Neolithic]] times. The [[Dian Kingdom]], whose original language likely belonged to the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], was also established near the area.<ref>''The Peopling of East Asia'', pp. 192</ref>

Dian was subjugated by the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in 109 BC. The Han dynasty incorporated the territory of the Dian Kingdom into their [[Yizhou (Southwest China)|Yizhou Commandery]], but left the King of Dian as the local ruler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/dian.html|title=Dian 滇 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|last=Theobald|first=Ulrich|website=www.chinaknowledge.de|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>

The Han dynasty (205 BC–AD 220), seeking control over the [[Tea Horse Road|Southern Silk Road]] running to Burma and India, brought small parts of Yunnan into China's orbit, but subsequent dynasties could do little to tame what was then a remote and wild borderland until the 13th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=General History of Yunnan |isbn=978-7500496854}}</ref>{{Contradictory-inline|reason=see previous paragraph|date=May 2024}} During the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618), two military expeditions were launched against the area, and it was renamed ''Kunzhou'' in Chinese sources.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The geography of China : sacred and historic places|url=https://archive.org/details/geographychinasa00plet|url-access=limited|date=2011|publisher=Britannica Educational Pub. in association with Rosen Education Services|others=Pletcher, Kenneth.|isbn=9781615301829|edition=1st|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/geographychinasa00plet/page/n260 260]|oclc=656841273}}</ref>

=== Medieval China ===
[[File:地藏寺经幢 左后方摄.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sutra Stone Pillar, Dali Kingdom period.]]
Founded in 765, Kunming was known to the Chinese as ''Tuodong'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=拓東}}) city in the [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]] (737–902) during the 8th and 9th centuries.<ref name=":0" /> Tuodong later became part of the successor [[Kingdom of Dali]] (937–1253). The possession of Tuodong changed hands when the city came under the control of the [[Yuan dynasty]] during its invasion of the southwest in 1252–1253. During the reign of provincial governor [[Ajall Shams al-Din Omar]], a "Chinese Style" city named Zhongjing was founded where modern Kunming is today. Shams al-Din ordered the construction of a Buddhist temple, a Confucian temple, and two mosques in the city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Great Wall : urban form and transformation on the Chinese frontiers|last=Gaubatz, Piper Rae, 1962-|date=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0804723990|location=Stanford, Calif.|pages=78|oclc=31970027}}</ref> The Confucian temple, doubling as a school, was the first of its kind in Yunnan, attracting students from minority groups across the province.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia|last=Tan, Ta Sen.|date=2010|publisher=ISEAS|isbn=9789812308375|pages=92|oclc=917840557}}</ref> Coupled with his promotion of Confucian ceremonies and customs, Shams al-Din has been largely credited with the [[sinicization]] of the region.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's Muslim Hui community : migration, settlement and sects|last=Dillon, Michael|date=7 December 2015|isbn=978-1138970441|pages=23|publisher=Routledge |oclc=941876321}}</ref> The city grew as a trading center between the southwest and the rest of China. It is considered by scholars to have been the city of ''Yachi Fu'' (鸭池府) where people had used [[cowry|cowries]] as cash and ate their meat raw, as described by the 13th-century Venetian traveler [[Marco Polo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat2/4sub8/entry-5456.html#chapter-2|title=MARCO POLO'S DESCRIPTIONS OF CHINA {{!}} Facts and Details|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> The area was first dubbed Kunming during the decline of the Yuan Dynasty.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===
[[File:Du Halde - Description de la Chine - Villes de la province de Yun nan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Maps of "Yun-nan-fou" and "[[Dali City|Ta-li-fou]]" from [[Du Halde]]'s 1736 ''[[Description of China]]'', based on reports from [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]]]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
In the 14th century, Kunming was retaken from Mongolian control when the [[Ming dynasty]] defeated the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Ming later built a [[defensive wall|wall]] surrounding present-day Kunming. 300 years later, Ming General [[Wu Sangui]] defected to Manchu invaders and held the city until his death in 1678, long after the rest of China had fallen under [[Manchu]] rule. During the beginning of Qing rule, the entirety of Yunnan and Guizhou were ruled from Kunming and Wu.<ref>{{citation|last=Spence|first=Jonathan D.|chapter=The K'ang-hsi Reign|editor-first=Willard J.|editor-last=Peterson|title=Cambridge History of China, Vol. 9, Part 1: The Ch'ing Dynasty to 1800|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|pages=120–182|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hi2THl2FUZ4C&pg=PA120|isbn=0521243343}}</ref> During the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the seat of Wu's newly declared Zhou dynasty was moved to [[Hengyang|Hengzhou]] in [[Hunan]]. Later in 1678, when Wu died, his grandson [[Wu Shifan]] resisted the Qing for two more months before committing suicide, reverting control of the city back into Qing hands. During the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, it was the seat of the [[Yunnan|superior prefecture of Yunnan]].

In 1832, the beginnings of a real city were acknowledged within the city walls and there were significant structures within their confines. The founding of the city can therefore be said to have been a predominantly 19th century affair. It was also in this century that the city grew to become the major market and transport centre for the region. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Many of the city's inhabitants were displaced as a result of the [[1833 Kunming earthquake]].

The rebel leader [[Du Wenxiu]], the Muslim Han Sultan of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], attacked and besieged the city several times between 1858 and 1868. A great part of the city's wealth did not survive the 1856 [[Panthay Rebellion]], when most of the Buddhist sites in the capital were badly damaged, converted to mosques or razed. Decades later, Kunming began to be influenced by the West, especially from the [[French colonial empires|French Empire]].

The meter-gauge rail line, only completed by around 1911, was designed by the French so that they could tap into Yunnan's mineral resources for their colonies in Indochina.

Kunming was a [[communications]] [[transport hub|center]] during this time and a junction of two major trading routes, one westward via [[Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture|Dali]] and [[Tengchong County]] into [[Myanmar]], the other southward through [[Mengzi County]] to the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] in [[Indochina]]. Eastward, a difficult mountain route led to [[Guiyang]] in Guizhou province and thence to [[Hunan]] province. To the northeast was a well-established trade trail to [[Yibin]] in Sichuan province on the [[Yangtze River]]. But these trails were all extremely difficult, passable only by mule trains or pack-carrying porters. {{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

Kunming was transformed into a modern city as a result of fighting of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese War/World War II]] in 1937 with the outbreak of the Battles of [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Nanking|Nanking]] and [[Battle of Taiyuan|Taiyuan]], forcing a great movement of refugees from the north and eastern coastal regions of China,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sun, Vlasova|first=Lianggang, Evgenia|date=|title=Shanghai 1937 – Where World War II Began|url=http://www.shanghai1937.tv/|access-date=2021-01-15|website=SHANGHAI 1937: WHERE WORLD WAR II BEGAN|language=en-US|quote=When did World War II begin?

The increased trade and expertise quickly established Kunming as an industrial and manufacturing base for the wartime government in [[Chongqing]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

As the battles of Shanghai, Taiyuan and [[Nanjing Massacre|Nanjing]] were lost by the end of 1937, and with [[Battle of Wuhan|Wuhan]] falling into Japanese occupation by the end of 1938, many more of China's military forces and civilians retreated to cities outside the reach of the Japanese military ground forces a year prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in Europe in 1939, including the relocation of the [[Republic of China Air Force Academy|Chinese Air Force Academy]] from [[Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport|Jianqiao Airbase]] to Kunming's [[Kunming Wujiaba International Airport|Wujiaba Airbase]], where the airfield was vastly expanded, becoming the new training hub for the battered but regrouped [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] in which Lieutenant General [[Claire Lee Chennault]] took command of cadet training duties in the summer of 1938. The Chinese Air Force command established the 41st Pursuit Squadron based in Kunming, also known as the French Volunteer Group squadron in June 1938, and with them they brought [[Dewoitine D.500|Dewoitine D.510]] fighters, with the intention of securing the sale of the planes to the Chinese Air Force; the French participated in some combat engagements against Japanese raids, including dogfights against [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighters with Chinese [[Curtiss BF2C Goshawk|''Hawk III'' fighters]] over [[Nanchang]], but after several setbacks, including a fighter pilot ''[[Killed in action|KIA]]'', the group was disbanded in October 1938.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gustavsson|first=Hakans|date=|title=Hakans Aviation page - Sino-Japanese Air War 1938|url=http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/sino-japanese-1938.htm|access-date=2021-01-17|website=Biplane Fighter Aces - China|quote=In June the 41st PS was organised in Kunming (Yunan Province), and with it served French advisors-volunteers.

Although the Empire of Japan was focusing on ending the Chinese '''''war of resistance''''' at the [[Bombing of Chongqing|Battle of Chongqing and Chengdu]], Kunming was not out of the reach of Japanese air raids, and faced attacks by [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|IJAAF]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|IJNAF]] bombers;<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=1940-06-18|title=KUNMING BOMBED|pages=1|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12473576|access-date=2021-01-15|quote=Tuesday, 18 June 1940, Japanese planes bombed Kunming, on the French Indo-China railway line... causing speculation of possible attack on Haiphong, which for two years an important entry point for imports to China.}}</ref> military assets and infrastructure were under regular attack, while the [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–1945)|RoCAF 18th Fighter Squadron]] and units of the Air Force Academy at Wujiaba were tasked with aerial defense of Kunming.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gustavsson|first=Hakans|date=|title=Håkans Aviation page – Sino-Japanese Air War 1939|url=http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/sino-japanese-1939.htm|access-date=2021-01-15|website=Biplane Fighter Aces - China|quote=In January 1939 the 18th PS relocated to Kunming for defence of the city from air attacks while continuing training on the Hawk 75Ms. Reportedly Claire Chennault led it (but the Squadron Commander was Major Yang Yibai)... 11 January 1939 Led by Squadron Commander Liu Yi-Jun (劉依鈞), the five remaining Hawk 75Ms of 25th PS were flown to Chongqing and transferred to the 18th PS.

When the city of [[Nanning]] fell to the Japanese during the [[Battle of South Guangxi]], China's sea-access was cut off. However, the Chinese victory at the [[Battle of Kunlun Pass]] kept the Burma Road open. When the Japanese began occupying [[French Indochina]] in 1940, the Burma Road that linked Kunming and the outside-world with unoccupied China grew increasingly vital as much of the essential support and materials were imported through [[Burma]]. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and the start of the [[Pacific War]] in December 1941, Kunming acted as an Allied military command center, which grouped the Chinese, American, British and French forces together for operations in Southeast Asia. Kunming became the northern and easternmost terminus of the vital war-supply line into China known as "''[[The Hump]]''', which stretched over the Himalayas from British bases in India to port-of-entry Kunming. The [[Office of Strategic Services]]' Service Unit [[Detachment 101]] (predecessor to the [[1st Special Forces Group]]) was also headquartered in Kunming. Its mission was to divert and disrupt Japanese combat operations in Burma.<ref>"Special Operations Association" (2005) By Special Operations Association.

Kunming, the northern terminus of all three of the Burma Road, the [[Ledo Road]], and '''''The Hump''''' supply-line, was increasingly targeted by the IJAAF. When the Burma Road was lost to the Japanese, the Hump became China's primary lifeline to the outside world. The 1st American Volunteer Group, known as the "[[Flying Tigers]]", was based in Kunming and tasked with defense of The Hump supply-line against Japanese aerial interceptions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rossi |first=J.R. |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger1.htm |title=History: The Flying Tigers&nbsp;— American Volunteer Group&nbsp;— Chinese Air Force |access-date=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722181853/http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger1.htm |archive-date=22 July 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Industry became important in Kunming during [[World War II]]. The large state-owned [[Central Machine Works]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=5413&inst_id=19&nv1=search&nv2= |title=AIM25 collection description |publisher=Aim25.ac.uk |access-date=23 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120744/http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=5413&inst_id=19&nv1=search&nv2= |archive-date=30 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> was transferred there from [[Hunan]], while the manufacture of electrical products, copper, cement, steel, paper, and textiles expanded.

=== After World War II ===
Until 1952, Kunming was a walled city. The city government in 1952 ordered hundreds of young people to tear down the wall and use its bricks to make a new road running north–south. To show its appreciation for the young people that demolished the east wall, the city government named the new street, Qingnian Lu, after them. The existence of the walls still echoes today at place names like the district of Xiaoximen ({{zh|labels=no|s=小西门|l=Lesser West Gate}}) and Beimen Jie ({{zh|labels=no|s=北门街|l=North Gate Street}}). There are also less obvious connections to the wall, such as Qingnian Lu ({{zh|labels=no|c=青年路 |l=Youth Road}}), in the location of Kunming's east wall.

After 1949, Kunming developed rapidly into an [[Metropolitan Regions of China|industrial metropolis]] with the construction of large iron and steel and chemical complexes, along with [[Chongqing]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Guiyang]] in the [[Southwest China|southwest]]. A [[Yunnan Institute for Nationalities|Minorities' Institute]] was set up in the 1950s to promote mutual understanding and access to university education among Yunnan's multiethnic population. The city consolidated its position as a supply depot during the [[Vietnam War]] and subsequent [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border clashes]]. Until Mao Zedong's death, in much of the rest of the country Kunming was still generally thought as a remote frontier settlement.
Accordingly, the government utilized Kunming as a place where to exile people who had fallen politically out of favor, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

In 1957, Kunming's rail link to Haiphong and Hanoi was re-opened (after being cut during World War II). It was cut again in 1979 and re-opened again in 1996.

[[File:KunmingOldNew.jpg|thumb|An old wooden house and a modern skyscraper in the background]]

Since the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] of the mid-1980s, Kunming has enjoyed increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Economy of China|foreign investment]]. Several [[Thai Chinese]] banks have offices in Kunming, for example, [[Kasikorn Bank]] and [[Krung Thai Bank]]. [[Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]] of Thailand has visited Kunming many times to study Chinese culture and promote friendly relations. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In the 1980s and 1990s, the city center was rebuilt, with Swiss help, in its current 'modern' style to impress visitors attending the [[1999 World Horticultural Exposition]].<ref>{{cite news |date=1 May 1999 |title=China hosts giant horticultural expo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/333018.stm |access-date=21 January 2008 |work=BBC World Service}}</ref> It was primarily during 1997 and 1998 that much of the city's roads, bridges and high rises were built.

In July 2005, the second [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] (GMS) Summit was held in Kunming, with government leaders from China, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam participating. There, China agreed to lend its neighbors more than $1&nbsp;billion for a series of projects. China promoted GMS cooperation as a first step toward building an eventual China-[[ASEAN]] [[Free Trade Area]].

Infrastructure improvements were underway to improve links between Kunming and Southeast Asia in time for the 2010 establishment of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. The FTA made Kunming a trade and financial center for Southeast Asia. In addition to physical improvements to enhance Kunming's trade with Southeast Asia, the central and provincial governments have made financial preparations to assist the city's emergence. At the end of 2004, the central government approved Kunming to be one of the 18 mainland cities in which foreign banks could conduct business in [[renminbi]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Kunming is a significant horticultural center in China, providing products such as grain, wheat, horsebeans, corn, potato and fruit such as peaches, apples, oranges, grapes and chestnuts. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Kunming is world-famous for its flowers and flower-growing exports. More than 400 types of flowers are commonly grown in Kunming. The [[camellia]], [[Yulan magnolia]], [[azalea]], [[fairy primrose]], [[lily]] and [[orchid]] are known as the six famous flowers of the city.

The camellia was confirmed by the Municipality of Kunming as its city flower in 1983.

The Kunming city government plans to create an environmental [[trial court]] to deal with environment-related lawsuits. It is to be part of the city's intermediate [[Local people's court|people's court]] and will have jurisdiction over appeals by companies that have been found guilty of violating environmental laws in cities throughout Yunnan.<ref>[http://en.chinagate.com.cn/news/2008-09/22/content_16513054.htm Kunming Plans to Establish Environment Court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004152138/http://en.chinagate.com.cn/news/2008-09/22/content_16513054.htm |date=4 October 2008 }} (CRIENGLISH.com 22 September 2008)</ref>

== Cityscape ==

[[File:Kunming square.jpg|thumb|Dongfeng (''East Wind'') Square. The building in the background, Workers' Cultural Hall, has been demolished for subway construction.]]

The city center has three major squares and six major streets: Jinma Biji Square, Nanping Square and Dongfeng Square are the main squares, while Nanping Street, Zhengyi Road, Renmin Road, Dongfeng Road, Jinbi Road, and Qingnian Road are the main streets. While Beijing Road is arguably the main street of the city as a whole, it runs to the east of the city center. Jingxing Street, Guanghua Street, Zhengyi Road, Nanping Street, Qingnian Road, and Renmin Road are the main commercial areas in Kunming; the most popular pedestrian streets are Nanping Street, Zhengyi Road, and Jingxing Street.

Kunming's modern city center is Nanping Square on the west bank of the [[Panlong River]], at the intersection of Nanping Street and Zhengyi Street. This area is where Kunming's southern city wall once stood. Rapidly being modernized, this area is a crowded and dense shopping precinct packed with clothing and electronics stores. Surrounding the area are plenty of new high-rises. The area formerly considered the city center is Dongfeng Square, located on the east bank of the [[Panlong River]] outside of the old city walls at the intersection of Beijing Road and Dongfeng Road, where in the mornings there are crowds doing [[taijiquan]] and playing [[badminton]]. Weekend amateur theatre is also performed in the square. The Panlong River has had an artificial flow ever since the construction of the Songhua Dam, and the river has been developed into effectively a canal. The river receives [[sewage]] and [[wastewater]] from surrounding pipes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Chang-Qun|last2=Hu|first2=Bin|last3=Wang|first3=Zheng-Hong|last4=Wen|first4=Chuan-Hao|last5=Yan|first5=Shen-Qi|last6=Jiang|first6=Xiao-Hua|last7=Wang|first7=Ding-Kang|last8=Li|first8=Qing|last9=Liang|first9=Xiao-Feng|date=1999-05-19|title=Tradescantia bioassays for the determination of genotoxicity of water in the Panlong River, Kunming, People's Republic of China|journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis|volume=426|issue=2|pages=127–131|doi=10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00054-8|pmid=10350584|bibcode=1999MRFMM.426..127D |issn=0027-5107}}</ref>

The center is an area of importance to Kunming's [[Hui people|Hui]] population, with Shuncheng Street, one of the last old streets in the center of the city, previously forming a Muslim quarter. Until shortly before 2005, this street was full of wind-dried beef and mutton carcasses, pitta bread and raisin sellers, and huge woks of roasting coffee beans being stirred with shovels.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Under Kunming's rapid modernisation, however, the street has been demolished to make way for apartments and shopping centers. Rising behind a supermarket one block north off Zhengyi Road, Nancheng Qingzhen Si is the city's new mosque, its green dome and chevron-patterned minaret visible from afar and built on the site of an earlier [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] edifice.

Running west off Zhengyi Road just past the mosque, Jingxing Street leads into one of the more bizarre corners of the city, with Kunming's huge Bird and Flower Market convening daily in the streets connecting it with the northerly, parallel Guanghua Street. The market offers many plants such as [[orchids]] that have been collected and farmed across the province. In the small grounds of a now vanished [[Temple of Confucius|Confucian temple]] off the western end of Changchun Road, there is an avenue of pines, an ancient pond and pavilion, and beds of bamboo, azaleas and potted palms.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Jinbi Road runs south of Dongfeng Road. Both of them connect to Beijing Road. Two large [[Chinese pagoda]]s rise south of Jinbi Road and the city center, each a solid thirteen stories of whitewashed brick crowned with four iron cockerels. The West Pagoda was built between 824 and 859, during the [[Tang dynasty]]; its original counterpart, the East Pagoda, was built at the same time, but was destroyed by [[1833 Kunming earthquake|an earthquake]] in 1833 and rebuilt in the same Tang style in 1882. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} South down Dongsi Road, past another [[mosque]], the entrance to the [[Eastern and Western Pagodas|West Pagoda]] is along a narrow lane on the right. In the tiny surrounding courtyard, sociable idlers while away sunny afternoons playing cards and sipping tea in the peaceful, ramshackle surroundings. The [[Eastern and Western Pagodas|East Pagoda]] is a more cosmetic, slightly tilted duplicate standing in an ornamental garden a few minutes' walk east on Shulin Jie. The temples associated with both pagodas are closed to the public.
[[File:昆明春城路蓝花楹属 20240424.jpg|thumb|Jacaranda trees in bloom along Chuncheng Road]]
Many streets are lined with [[Jacaranda]] trees, which can be seen blooming abundantly in mid to late April, particularly on Jiaochang Middle Road. The trees are not native to Kunming, but originate from seeds exchanged with [[Algeria]], which were grown in the [[Kunming Institute of Botany|Kunming Botanical Garden]]. Seeds from the botanical garden were then used by the city to plant the trees along streets.<ref>{{Cite web |title=蓝花楹－昆明初夏街边独特的一抹蓝----中国科学院昆明植物研究所 |url=http://www.kib.cas.cn/kxcb/kpdt/201706/t20170607_4808780.html |access-date=2024-06-09 |website=www.kib.cas.cn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=【七彩文韵】昆明的蓝花楹 |url=https://m.yunnan.cn/system/2024/05/09/033044926.shtml |access-date=2024-06-09 |website=m.yunnan.cn}}</ref>

=== Parks ===

[[File:XishanHuatingTemple.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Huating Temple]] (华亭寺) in the [[Western Hills Forest Reserve|Western Hills]] near Kunming]]

[[Cuihu Park]] (Green Lake Park) is one of Kunming's major parks and is predominately a lake surrounded by greenery. Located in the west side of the park is the statue of one of Yunnan's most famous patriots—[[Nie Er]], the composer of China's [[March of the Volunteers|national anthem]]. Now it is open to public for free.

[[Daguan Park]] lies on [[Dian Chi]] in Kunming's southwestern limits. Originally laid out by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], it has been modified over the years to include a noisy funfair, food stalls and emporiums, and is a favourite haunt of Kunming's youth.

Kunming's zoo, founded in 1950, is adjoined to [[Yuantong Park]]. The zoo houses 5,000 animals from 140 species and receives 3 million visitors a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-06/29/content_343575.htm |title=A farewell to two zoos? |access-date=21 January 2008 |last=Ma |first=Guihua |date=29 June 2004 |work=China Daily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105045728/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-06/29/content_343575.htm |archive-date=5 November 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Other parks in Kunming include [[Heilongtan (Kunming)|Black Dragon Pool]], and the Kunming Botanical Gardens in the north, and [[Wenmiao Tea Garden]] in [[Wuhua District]].

=== Landmarks ===

The "[[World Horti-Expo Garden|Garden of the World Horticultural Exposition]]", located in the northern suburbs of Kunming, is {{convert|6|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} from central Kunming. From 1 May to 31 October 1999, Kunming held the 1999 World Horticulture Exposition, with the theme of "Man and Nature—Marching Toward the 21st Century".

The "[[Golden Hall Scenic Zone]]", located on the Mingfeng Hill in the northern suburbs of Kunming, is {{convert|8|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} from central Kunming. Constructed in 1602 (the 30th year of the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] reign period of the Ming dynasty), all of its beams, pillars, arches, doors, windows, tiles, Buddhist statues, and horizontal inscribed boards are made of copper, weighing more than 200 tons. It is the largest copper building in China.

Notable museums in Kunming:
* [[Yunnan Provincial Museum]]
* [[Kunming City Museum]] (redeveloped in 2014)
* [[Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology]] (opened in November 2006)
* [[Yunnan Ethnology Museum]] (opened 1995)
[[File:55606-Kunming-Yuantong-Temple.jpg|thumb|[[Yuantong Temple]], the largest Buddhist complex in Kunming]]
[[Yuantong Si]] is Kunming's major Buddhist temple. It is Kunming's largest and most famous temple with the original structure being first constructed more than 1,200 years ago during the [[Tang dynasty]]. The temple sits in a depression on the southern side of Yuantong Park. Northwest about {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} from the city center is the [[Qiongzhu Si]] (Bamboo Temple) built in 639 and rebuilt in 1422 to 1428. Numerous Buddhist temples line the road to the Dragon Gate ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|龙门}}) in the [[Western Mountains]].

== Administrative divisions ==

The prefecture-level city of Kunming has jurisdiction over 14 subdivisions; seven districts, one county-level city, three counties and three autonomous counties.
Kunming also borders with [[Panzhihua]] prefecture level city and [[Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture]] of Sichuan province.

The historical city and current city center of Kunming is in southeastern Wuhua District, close to where the four main districts converge. However, after integrating it into Kunming in 2011, the Kunming city government has built a masterplanned new city center in Chenggong District and moved the city government offices there.

Kunming plans to add two new districts (Chenggong and Jinning) to its existing four urban districts (Panlong, Wuhua, Guandu, Xishan) over the next few years.

== Society and culture ==
[[File:红河大剧院 - 音乐厅 - 2023-06-29.jpg|thumb|Honghe Grand Theater]]

=== Leisure and entertainment ===
[[File:Mixian Rice Noodles Being Prepared in Copper Pots.jpg|thumb|Mixian (米线) rice noodles being cooked in copper pots (铜锅) on gas elements at a noodle restaurant in Kunming.]]

Within Kunming, the entertainment district has its focus around Kundu Square, with many cinemas, bars, clubs and restaurants. Food aside, one feature of less formal [[Yunnanese cuisine|Yunnanese]] restaurants is that they often have a communal bamboo water pipe and tobacco for their customers. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} There are plenty of student bars and clubs. The city has several operatic troupes and indigenous entertainments which include ''huadeng'', a lantern dance. Although indoor performances are lacking, there are often informal shows at the weekend outside the Workers' Cultural Hall and in Cuihu Park. There are similar shows at the Yunnan Arts Theater on Dongfeng Xi Lu. Kunming's main cinema house is on the south side of the Dongfeng Lu/Zhengyi Lu intersection. The other main multiplex, the XJS, at the junction of Wenlin Jie and Dongfeng Xi Lu.

=== Language ===

{{Further|Kunming dialect}}

The Kunming dialect is very similar to that of Sichuan and Guizhou but uses the third tone much less than standard Chinese. Many terms are used only in Kunming dialect, such as "{{lang|zh|板扎}}" meaning 'terrific'.

The pronunciations of certain Chinese characters are very different from [[Mandarin Chinese]]. For example, "{{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|鱼}} (fish)" would be pronounced as "yi" in Kunming dialect instead of "yu" in Mandarin Chinese; "{{linktext|lang=zh|街}} (street)" would be pronounced as "gai" instead of "jie".

When someone speaks Mandarin Chinese with a strong Kunming accent, it'll be called Mapu ({{lang|zh-Hans|马普}}), short for Majie ({{lang|zh-Hans|马街}}, a place in Kunming) Mandarin Chinese.

The Kunming Dialect is slowly dying due to it being 'informal' and is being replaced by [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Nevertheless, it is still spoken by a decent number of residents today. Sometimes this is called dirt language or slum language (土话)

=== Tourism ===

[[File:Kunming-canal-20030824.jpg|thumb|Panlong River]]

Kunming attracts domestic and foreign tourists year-round. At the center of Yunnan and as its capital, Kunming is also a [[transport hub]] for tourists heading to other parts of Yunnan such as [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]], [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] and [[Shangri-La County|Shangrila]].

Conference and exhibition venues in Kunming include the Kunming International Convention and Exhibition Center and the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Hall.

[[Kingdom of the Little People]], a theme park featuring performers with [[dwarfism]], is also located near Kunming.<ref name=tnyt>{{cite news|last=LaFraniere|first=Sharon|title=A Miniature World Magnifies Dwarf Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/world/asia/04dwarfs.html|access-date=13 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006232159/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/world/asia/04dwarfs.html|archive-date=6 October 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other famous attractions include [[Stone Forest]] and Yunnan's Ethnic Village.

== Sports ==

Every year, many Chinese and international athletes come to Kunming for high-altitude training. The city has been China's national high-elevation training base for more than 30 years. There are two major training complexes, [[Hongta Sports Center]] and [[Haigeng National Training Center]].<ref name="highaltitudetrainingcenters">{{cite web |url=http://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/526/chinas_highaltitude_training_centers |title=China's high-altitude training centers |date=24 March 2008 |publisher=Gokunming.com |access-date=23 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711110008/http://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/526/chinas_highaltitude_training_centers |archive-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Hongta Sports Center was built in 2000 by Hongta (Red Pagoda) cigarette company, at a cost of US$58&nbsp;million. Located near [[Haigeng Park]], the complex is mostly used by professional athletes, but also acts as a sports club for the general public. Every weekend, it hosts amateur football matches. Aside from about 10 football pitches, including one surrounded by a running track, Hongta also has a {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} swimming pool, a badminton gymnasium, tennis courts and a basketball court. It also has one of China's few ice hockey rinks, and a workout room with treadmills and weightlifting machines. There are also game rooms for air hockey; also pool tables and a basement bowling alley. The complex comes complete with a 101-room hotel and restaurant.<ref name="highaltitudetrainingcenters"/>

Haigeng National Training Center is located ten minutes away from Hongta on Dianchi (Lake Dian) near Kunming's award-winning Lakeview Golf Club and new condominium developments.

[[File:石林县城天际线 - 2024-05-24 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Aerial view of Kunming in May 2024]]
Kunming has three economic advantages over other cities in southwest China: significant natural resources, a large [[consumer market]] and a mild climate. Due to its position at the center of Yunnan, one of China's largest producers of agricultural products, minerals and [[hydroelectricity]], Kunming is the main commercial hub for most of the province's resources.

Kunming's chief industries are [[copper]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]] production. Its [[iron]] and [[steel]] industry has been expanded. [[Salt]] and [[phosphate]] mines around Kunming are some of the largest in China. [[Yunnan Copper Company Limited]], based in Kunming, is one of Yunnan's largest mining corporations. From the late 1970s, Kunming's main industries also came to include food and tobacco processing and the manufacture of [[construction equipment]] and machines. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In May 1995, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] approved Kunming as an Open City. By the end of 1995, the city had approved 929 overseas-funded enterprises with a total investment of $2.3&nbsp;billion including $1.1&nbsp;billion of foreign capital. More than 40 projects each had an investment of more than $9&nbsp;million.

Kunming is a center of [[engineering]] and the manufacture of [[machine tool]]s, [[electrical machine]]ry, [[electrical equipment|equipment]] and [[automobile]]s (including [[heavy goods vehicle]]s). It has a [[chemical industry]], and [[plastics]], [[cement]] works and [[textile]] [[factories]]. Its processing [[plant]]s, which include [[tanneries]], [[woodworking]] and [[papermaking]] factories, use [[Agriculture in China|local agricultural products]]. In 1997, Yunnan Tire Co. opened a tire plant in Kunming, with a capacity to produce two million tires per year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Development zones ===

Kunming has two major development zones, [[Kunming High-tech Industrial Development Zone]] (biological medicine, new materials, electronic information, photoelectron, agriculture) and [[Kunming Economic and Technology Development Zone]] (mechanical equipment production, biological science and food industry, information industry, software).

=== Industrial parks ===

There are 30 key industrial parks promulgated and recognized by [[National Development and Reform Commission]] in Yunnan Province.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.km.gov.cn/ColumnInfo.aspx?cid=23&page=2 |title=Kunming - China.GOV |access-date=17 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006225849/http://en.km.gov.cn/ColumnInfo.aspx?cid=23 |archive-date=6 October 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The largest include:
* Chenggong Industrial Park
* Anning Industrial Park
* Songming Yanglin Industrial Development Zone
* Dongchuan Special Industrial Park
* Xundian Special Industrial Park
* Kunming Haikou Industrial Park.

=== Companies ===

{{As of|2008}}, Kunming is home to 65 of the Top 100 Enterprises in Yunnan Province. The top 100 enterprises were based on their revenues for 2007. [[Hongta Group]], with revenues of some [[Renminbi|RMB]]39.88&nbsp;billion for 2007 topped the list. The [[tobacco]] sector remains the largest sector in the province.

=== Flower industry ===

Yunnan has developed into the largest flower export base in Asia, with many Dutch experts having transferred technology to the area. The Dounan Flower Market, located in suburban Kunming, is the largest in China with daily sales of 2.5&nbsp;million yuan (US$300,000) from the 2 million sprays of flowers ({{As of|2006|lc=y}}). The provincial government agency, the Yunnan Flower Association, regulates the industry.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/25/business/worldbusiness/25flower.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Keith | last=Bradsher | title=Bouquet of Roses May Have Note: 'Made in China' | date=25 September 2006 | access-date=17 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017052851/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/25/business/worldbusiness/25flower.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 | archive-date=17 October 2015 | url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Logistics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Kunming East Station is at present Yunnan province's only container handling depot, with direct links to only three provinces; [[Guangdong]], [[Guizhou]] and [[Sichuan]]. It also has direct access to the metropolitan district of [[Chongqing]].

The Jiaying Depot is connected with the new system of highways built linking Yunnan to the increasingly important markets of [[Southeast Asia]], facilitating cheap Chinese exports to the region and granting resource-poor China greater access to the region's massive raw material resources. Yunnan has thereby become a progressively important area in the [[Southwestern China|Southwest]]'s rail logistics both in terms of national and international logistics.

== Solar energy ==
In July 2008, Kunming began to implement a program to transform the city's [[solar energy]] industry into a US$8.8&nbsp;billion industrial base in China by 2013. Kunming receives an annual average sunshine of more than 2,400 hours. Each 1&nbsp;kW PV system has the potential to generate 1500 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year from solar energy. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

{{As of|2007}}, the Kunming Economic Committee listed about 130 solar energy enterprises in the city. Of these, 118 enterprises produce solar lamps and solar water heaters, with a combined total production value of about US$43.8&nbsp;million, and 10 enterprises are engaged in solar photovoltaic cells manufacturing, with a total production value of about US$51.2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emerging-china.com/articles/849470.html|title=Kunming aims to build a city run by solar energy|work=emerging-china.com|access-date=12 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808121943/http://www.emerging-china.com/articles/849470.html|archive-date=8 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Suntech Power]] announced in December 2008 that it was jointly constructing a solar energy project with Yunnan Provincial Power Investment and other investors. The 1MW first-phase of the [[Shilin Yi Autonomous County|Shilin]] 66MW on-grid solar power station began generating power on 28 December 2009. The initial phase of the 66MW project was originally scheduled to start production in first half of 2010 while the 20MW second phase and 36 MW third phase were under construction.

[[File:Front view of Kunming Changshui Airport.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Kunming Changshui International Airport]]]]
Kunming is situated on the [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau]]. Rail and air are the main two methods to travel to or from Kunming from outside Yunnan.

=== Air transport ===
{{main|Kunming Changshui International Airport|Kunming Wujiaba International Airport}}

Kunming has air connections with several Chinese and [[Southeast Asia]]n cities. Kunming is served by [[Kunming Changshui International Airport]] ('''KMG'''), which opened in June 2012, replacing the older [[Kunming Wujiaba International Airport|international airport]], which was located {{convert|4|–|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of central Kunming.

The now defunct [[Yunnan Airlines]] was headquartered in Kunming until it was acquired by [[China Eastern Airlines]]. China Southwest Airlines used to operate routes to and from Kunming, until it was merged with [[Air China]].

[[Lucky Air]] is a budget airline based in Kunming and operates scheduled services from [[Dali City, Yunnan|Dali]] to Kunming and [[Xishuangbanna]], and plans to expand to other areas of China.

Currently, the longest non-stop flight from Kunming is to [[Paris]], France, operated by China Eastern Airlines since 18 December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cits.net/china-travel-news/direct-flights-between-kunming-and-paris-launched.html |title=Direct flights between Kunming and Paris launched - CITS |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209124416/http://www.cits.net/china-travel-news/direct-flights-between-kunming-and-paris-launched.html |archive-date=9 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Highway ===

{{See also|Asian Highway Network|Eurasian Land Bridge}}
[[File:Kunming Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Kunming's main railway station]]

[[China National Highway]]s [[China National Highway 108|108]], [[China National Highway 213|213]] and [[China National Highway 320|320]] intersect in Kunming. Highways link Kunming to [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]], and provide Yunnan province access to [[seaport]]s of [[Southeast Asia]].

=== Rail ===

Kunming is the main rail hub of Yunnan province. The [[Chengdu–Kunming railway]] from [[Sichuan]], [[Shanghai–Kunming railway]] from [[Guizhou]], and [[Nanning–Kunming railway]] from [[Guangxi]] converge in Kunming from the north, northeast and east. The [[Yunnan–Vietnam Railway]] runs from Kunming southeast to [[Hekou Yao Autonomous County|Hekou]] and [[Lao Cai]] on the Sino-Vietnamese border and then on to [[Haiphong]] The [[Kunming–Yuxi railway]] runs south to [[Yuxi]], where a second rail line to Vietnam is being planned and built. To the west of Kunming, the [[Guangtong–Dali railway]] extends off the Chengdu–Kunming Line to [[Dali City|Dali]] ([[Xiaguan Town]]).

Kunming has three major railway stations:
*[[Kunming railway station]] is at the southern end of Beijing Xi Lu. Compared with the other railway station (North Railway Station), Kunming Railway Station services most of the "conventional" (not high-speed) trains to places to other provinces of China. Trains run north to Chengdu, southeast via Xingyi to Baise and Nanning in Guangxi, and east through Guizhou, via [[Liupanshui]], [[Anshun]], [[Guiyang]], into the rest of the country.
*[[Kunming South railway station]], opened at the end of 2016, is located in [[Chenggong District]], many miles southeast from the historical city center. It is the western terminal of the [[Shanghai–Kunming high-speed railway]] and the Guangzhou–[[Nanning–Kunming high-speed railway]], and has high-speed service to destinations along these lines and elsewhere on the nation's high-speed network.
*[[Kunming North railway station]] (serviced by the No. 23 Bus) is on the heritage {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} [[Kunming–Hai Phong Railway]], which runs to [[Hekou Yao Autonomous County|Hekou]] and [[Vietnam]]. Most of the station has been converted into a museum. Due to the deterioration of the railway line, the long distance narrow-gauge service has been cancelled; however, {{As of|2012|lc=y}}, some local narrow gauge service still operates at Kunming North Railway Station, in particular two daily trains to Shizui ({{lang|zh|石咀}}) Station on the western outskirts of Kunming, and to Wangjiaying ({{lang|zh-Hans|王家营}}) east of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mafengwo.cn/i/856012.html|script-title=zh:滇越铁路徒步第一程（昆明——宜良）|website=Mafengwo|access-date=19 November 2012|archive-date=30 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230205509/http://www.mafengwo.cn/i/856012.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As of 2017, railway development projects continue to proceed in the Kunming metropolitan area. In February 2017, the railway authorities announced that a connector between the new Kunming South railway station and the old Kunming railway station (also known as the Nanyao Station; {{lang|zh-Hans|南窑火车站}}) will open by the end of 2017, making it possible for some high-speed train to serve Kunming railway station as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Qiao |first1=Changhong (乔长红) |url=http://yn.yunnan.cn/html/2017-02/28/content_4742992.htm |script-title=zh:昆明南窑火车站年底有望通高铁. 昆明铁路枢纽扩能改造工程年底完工，滇池环线铁路将闭合 |website=yunnan.cn |language=zh-cn |date=2017-02-28 |access-date=1 March 2017 |archive-date=28 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228054236/http://yn.yunnan.cn/html/2017-02/28/content_4742992.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Urban rail plan ====
{{See also|Kunming Metro}}
[[File:Kunming_Metro_System_Map_201806.png|thumb|275px|[[Kunming Metro]] began operation in 2014]]
In May 2010, Kunming began construction on its first urban rail lines, line 1 and 2 of the [[Kunming Metro]]. An elevated test section had been under construction since 2009. Parts of lines 1 and 2 opened in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/kunming-opens-more-metro-lines.html |title=Kunming opens more metro lines |publisher=Railwaygazette |access-date=25 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728155316/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/kunming-opens-more-metro-lines.html |archive-date=28 July 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Construction on line 3 began in August 2010 and the Phase 1 was completed in 2018. The entire system consisting of 6 lines and covering a total of {{convert|162|km|0|abbr=off}} is estimated to be complete by 2018.

==== High-speed rail plan ====
Kunming will be the hub and terminus for the "[[Kunming–Singapore Railway|Pan Asia High Speed Network]]" using high-speed trains to connect China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.<ref>{{cite news|title=China continues building the Pan Asian High speed railway network|url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/04/china-continues-building-pan-asian-high.html|access-date=29 April 2016|publisher=Next Big Future|date=28 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430105544/http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/04/china-continues-building-pan-asian-high.html|archive-date=30 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Completed but under trial high-speed railways:

# [[Shanghai–Kunming High-Speed Railway|Kunming–Shanghai]]. The construction completed on 16 June 2016. It goes through 6 provincial capital cities: Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, Guiyang and Kunming. The overall length is {{convert|2266|km|mi|abbr=off}}. As estimated it would take 3 hours from Shanghai to Nanchang, 2.5 hours from Hangzhou to Nanchang, 4 hours from Kunming to Changsha, 8 hours from Kunming to Hangzhou and 9 hours from Shanghai to Kunming. It is expected to start operating on 30 December 2016.

[[File:New highway by Western Hill, Kunming - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A highway in Western Hill, Kunming]]

=== Road and transit ===
[[File:Kunming night.jpg|thumb|Dongfeng Road, one of Kunming's main arteries.]]
Yunnan has built a comprehensive highway system with roads reaching almost all the major cities or towns in the region. Bus travel across the region is extensive. Buses head from Kunming to destinations such as [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]] and [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] several times a day.

There are four major long-distance bus stations in Kunming with the South Bus Station and Railway Square Bus Station being the most primary.
* South Bus Station faces the Kunming Railway Station in Beijing Xi Lu, with standard, luxury, express and sleeper buses departing for all over Yunnan and neighboring provinces.
* Railway Square Bus Station is smaller than SBS and the majority of the buses depart from the station are private-run. Usually no fixed schedules are available and buses will leave when they are full. There are standard and sleeper services to Dali, Jinghong and elsewhere in Yunnan.

Leaving China by road into [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] is also possible through the respective crossings at Hekou in southeastern Yunnan or [[Bian Mao Zhan]] in [[Xishuangbanna]].

The [[Kunming–Bangkok Expressway]] is the first [[Expressways of China|expressway from China]] to Bangkok via Laos. The {{convert|1800|km|abbr=on}} long Kunming–Bangkok Expressway begins at Kunming going down to [[Ban Houayxay]] in Laos; it then crosses the [[Mekong River]] to [[Chiangkhong]] in [[Thailand]] and eventually reaches [[Bangkok]].

At the 14th [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] Ministerial Conference in July 2007, China, Laos and Thailand signed an agreement on the construction of a new bridge over the Mekong River to connect Chiangkhong in Thailand and Ban Houayxay in Laos, to the Kunming–Bangkok Highway. The completion of the new bridge over the Mekong River will help connect China's southeast provinces with Bangkok. With capital investments from both China and Thailand, the bridge is expected to be completed in 2011 and will be the last link in the highway system that winds through the Mekong River region.

==== Local transit ====

Public buses and taxis are the two main means of transport within the city. A metro system is currently under construction (see [[Kunming Metro]]).

Nearly two hundred public bus lines crisscross the city center, covering the whole prefecture.

Cycling is common, and many hotels around the Kunming Railway Station provide bicycle rental services.

Conscious of its growing traffic issues, the city is currently renovating a [[pedestrian]]-friendly city centre.

==== Central Kunming ====
[[File:书香大地 云南师范大学附属中学呈贡校区 雨花毓秀.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Chenggong, Kunming|Chenggong District]] in 2022]]
The city hangs off two main [[thoroughfare]]s: Beijing Lu forms the north–south axis, passing just east of the center as it runs for {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} between the city's two trains stations; while Dongfeng Lu crosses it halfway along, divided into east (Dongfeng Dong Lu), middle (Dongfeng Zhong Lu) and west (Dongfeng Xi Lu) sections as it cuts right through the business center. The far end runs out of the city as Renmin Xi Lu, the first leg of the [[Burma Road]]. Most of the city's famous hotels and foreign [[consulate]]s lies along Dongfeng Dong Lu and the southern half of Beijing Lu, while the majority of specific landmarks and [[shopping district]] are north and west of the center around Dongfeng Xi Lu and [[Green Lake (Kunming)|Cuihu Park (Green Lake Park)]]. Circling most of this is the city's first [[highway]] [[ring road]], Huancheng Lu, though others are planned.

== Education and research ==

Kunming remains a major educational and cultural center in the [[Southwest China|southwest region of China]], with universities, medical and teacher-training colleges, technical schools, and scientific research institutes.

=== HIV/AIDS ===

{{main|HIV/AIDS in Yunnan}}

In late 2006, China's first provincial-level [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] treatment center was built. The US$17.5&nbsp;million center is located {{convert|28|km|abbr=on}} from downtown Kunming. The center has six main departments: clinical treatment, technical consulting, research and development, international exchange and cooperation, clinical treatment training and psychological therapy.

Yunnan, with a population of more than 45 million, leads China in HIV/AIDS infections: primarily spread through intravenous drug use and unsafe sex, often involving the sex industry. According to official statistics, by the end of 2005, Yunnan was home to more than 48,000 HIV-infected patients, 3,900 patients with AIDS and a death toll of 1,768.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Modeling the HIV/AIDS Epidemic Among Injecting Drug Users and Sex Workers in Kunming, China|doi=10.1007/s11538-005-9051-y|pmid=16794944|publisher=Springerlink.com|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|volume=68|issue=3|date=April 2006|first=Nicolas|last=Bacaër|author2=Xamxinur Abdurahman|author3=Jianli Ye|pages=525–550|s2cid=352971|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01378034/file/Kunming.pdf|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-date=4 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804031608/https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/error/pagenotfound|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Military ==

Kunming is headquarters of the [[14th Army (People's Republic of China)|14th Group Army]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]], one of the two group armies that comprise the [[Chengdu Military Region]] responsible for the defense of China's southwestern borders with India and [[Myanmar]], as well as security in [[Tibet]].

== Public security and crime ==
The headquarters of the Kunming Municipal [[Public security bureau (China)|Public Security Bureau]] is on Beijing Lu. Its foreign affairs department, located on Jinxing Huayuan, Jinxing Xiao Lu in the northeast of the city, handles immigration and travel visas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.8599999.net/crjweb/index.asp |script-title=zh:昆明市公安局西山分局涉外网络警务室 |publisher=8599999.net |access-date=22 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624084454/http://www.8599999.net/crjweb/index.asp |archive-date=24 June 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Drug trafficking ===
{{See also|Illegal drug trade in China}}

Kunming has a pivotal role as a major conduit point in international [[drug trafficking]] as it is the closest major [[Chinese city]] to the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. The Kunming Municipal Public Security Bureau Narcotics Squad is the specialist counter-narcotics police service.

Police confiscated at least three tons of drugs in Yunnan in 2005. Yunnan province seized 10 tons of illegal drugs in 2006, accounting for 80 percent of the total drugs confiscated nationwide during the period, according to Sun Dahong, then deputy director of Yunnan's provincial [[Public security bureau (China)|Public Security Bureau]]. The total is more than double the amount seized in the province in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/194657.htm |title=Yunnan Witnesses Record Drug-busting 2006 |publisher=china.org.cn |date=31 December 2006 |access-date=22 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720130145/http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/194657.htm |archive-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Heroin]] and [[methamphetamine]] seem to be the main targets of the 30,000+ strong anti-drug police in Yunnan. The majority of heroin coming into China from the Golden Triangle passes through [[Dali City, Yunnan|Dali]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} from where it is then distributed to the rest of China and internationally via China's coastal cities.

Kunming Municipal Compulsory Rehabilitation Center in Kunming is the main rehabilitation center for drug addicts, mostly recovering from heroin addiction. International drug rings have used Yunnan and Kunming to channel new synthetic drugs (like [[methamphetamine]]) as well as traditional drugs like [[heroin]].

[[Opium]] was until recently in widespread medicinal use by many of the minority peoples of the province; however, after the [[Opium War]] the [[Chinese government]] has made growing the [[poppy]] illegal, and all but stamped out its production within the borders of Yunnan.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
