'''Guarujá''' ({{IPAc-en|g|w|ɑː|r|ʊ|ˈ|ʒ|ɑː}}; {{IPA|pt|ɡwaɾuˈʒa}}) is a municipality in the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]] of [[Brazil]]. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of [[Baixada Santista]].<ref>[http://www.al.sp.gov.br/repositorio/legislacao/lei.complementar/1996/lei.complementar-815-30.07.1996.html Assembleia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo, Lei Complementar Nº 815]</ref> The population is 311,116 (2022 preliminary census count) in an area of {{convert|143.58|km²|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ibge>[http://cod.ibge.gov.br/2322K Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]</ref> This place name comes from the [[Tupi language]], and means "narrow path". The population is highly urbanized, forms a 2nd urban core and beachfront island across the river from [[São Vicente Island (São Paulo, Brazil)|São Vicente Island]], the island (Ilha de Santo Amaro) is coterminous with the municipality, with exception of small offshore isles like Ilha dos Arvoredos.

== Toponym ==
See also: [[Tupi-Guarani|Tupi-Guarani place names in Brazil]]

As [[Eduardo de Almeida Navarro|Eduardo Navarro]] explains in his [[Dicionário de Tupi Antigo]] (2013), "Guarujá" is derived from the [[Tupi language|Tupi]] term agûarausá, which designates a type of crab, the [[Ocypode quadrata|guaruçá]].

Although it is common to use the definite article before the name of the city, this usage is not correct. Therefore, one should say "Tenho casa em Guarujá" and not "Tenho casa no Guarujá".<ref>{{Cite web |title=EncontraGuaruja.com {{!}} Guia de Guarujá » EncontraGuaruja.com |url=https://www.encontraguaruja.com/ |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=EncontraGuaruja.com |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Guaruja.SP.Asturias.SobreAsOndas.Warchavick.jpg|thumb|left|Asturias beach]]
Guarujá is located on the island Santo Amaro, situated on the shore of São Paulo. Its main economic sources are seasonal [[tourism]] and [[port]] related activities.

Guarujá is a popular weekend destination for families from [[São Paulo]], who can get there driving in less than one hour (through the [[Rodovia dos Imigrantes|Imigrantes highway]]). Traffic gets heavy during the evening on the holidays.

Guarujá has a [[borough]] called ''Vicente de Carvalho'', in tribute to the [[Parnasianism|Parnasianist]] [[poet]].

A nickname for the city is "The Pearl of the Atlantic".

In total, Guarujá has 27 beaches, with the most famous including Guaiúba, Tombo, Astúrias, Pitangueiras, Enseada, Pernambuco, Perequê, São Pedro, Tijucopava, Iporanga, Praia Branca and Praia Preta.

==Economy==
Guarujá, its history, infrastructure and proximity to the country's most populous city, provides strong attractive real estate and tourism. Much of the region on the coast, the beaches near the center (mainly Asturias Pitangueiras, Enseada, and Tombo) are taken by buildings devoted to the seasonal population, who arrives mostly in summer. Tourism, therefore, is the most important component that moves the economy.

The other part, relevant and non-seasonal, comes from the port (left bank of the Port of Santos) and related activities, such as transportation. Due to its proximity to Cubatao (largest industrial district in the country) and ports, there is also interest in industrial occupation in the region, started in 1976 by Dow Chemical, still the only major industry to occupy the region.

According to the IBGE of 2006 the production of wealth in the service area in the city, added that year, US$1.820 billion, equivalent to 0.14% in participation in the Brazilian GDP.
