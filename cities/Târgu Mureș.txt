It is the [[list of cities and towns in Romania|16th-largest city]] in Romania, with 116,033 inhabitants as of the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]]. It lies on the [[Mureș (river)|Mureș River]], the second-longest river in Romania (after the [[Danube]]).

[[File:Nameplate of Marosvásárhely cropped.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A trilingual town sign in Târgu Mureș. ''Marosvásárhely'' is the Hungarian name and ''Neumarkt am Mieresch'', German. The top sign reflects the pre-1993 version ''Tîrgu-Mureș''.]]

The current [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name of the city, ''Târgu Mureș'', is the equivalent of the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''Marosvásárhely'', both meaning "market on the [[Mureș (river)|Mureș]] (Maros) [River]". ''Târg'' means "market" in Romanian and ''vásárhely'' means "marketplace" in Hungarian. Local Hungarians often shorten ''Marosvásárhely'' to ''Vásárhely'' in speech.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest [[Martin Szentiványi]] provides the first known written reference naming the city; in his work ''Dissertatio Paralipomenonica Rerum Memorabilium Hungariae'' (written in 1699) he records the name as ''Asserculis'' by stating, in [[Latin]], ''Asserculis, hoc est Szekely Vasarhely'', meaning, ''Asserculis, here is Szekely Vasarhely''.  He provides the year 1230 for the reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50VBAAAAcAAJ&q=asserculis&pg=PA110|title=Dissertatio Paralipomenonica Rerum Memorabilium Hungariae: Ex Parte Prima Decadis Tertiae, Curiosiorum & Selectiorum, Variarum Scientiarum Miscellaneorum R.

Another written reference of the city was in the Papal registry in [[Latin]] as ''Novum Forum Siculorum'' in 1332{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}, and later as ''Sekulvasarhel'' (modern Hungarian: ''Székelyvásárhely''), meaning "market of the [[Székelys]]", in 1349{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}. Greek traders called it "Agropolis".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Targu-Mures|title=Târgu Mureş – Romania|website=britannica.com|access-date=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217203230/https://www.britannica.com/place/Targu-Mures|archive-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> Another name for it was "Areopolis"{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

In 1616, [[Gabriel Bethlen]] gave the name ''Marosvásárhely'' to the newly upgraded [[royal free city]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUkqAQAAIAAJ&q=%22The+town+was+named+Marosv%C3%A1s%C3%A1rhely+in+1616%22|title=Acta Ethnographica Hungarica|date=1 May 2018|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó}}</ref> The Romanian name for the city, ''Oșorhei'' was a phonetic derivation from ''Vásárhely'' while the [[German language|German]] name for the town, ''Neumarkt am [[Mureș (river)|Mieresch]]'' (also shortened to ''Neumarkt'' or ''Marktstadt''; in [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect|Transylvanian Saxon]], ''Nai Mark'' or ''Nai Muark''), can be translated as ''New Market''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GU6AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA360|title=A Universal Pronouncing Gazetteer: Containing Topographical, Statistical, and Other Information, of All the More Important Places in the Known World, from the Most Recent and Authentic Sources ...|first=Thomas Baldwin (of|last=Philadelphia.)|date=1 May 2018|publisher=[[J.

Other historical Romanian names for the town besides ''Oșorhei'' were ''Mureș-Oșorhei'' and ''Târgul-Mureșului''; other historical Hungarian names in addition to ''Székelyvásárhely'' included ''Újszékelyvásár'' and ''Újvásár''.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

After [[World War I]], Marosvásárhely became part of Romania and was renamed ''Oșorheiu''.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The name ''Târgu Mureș'' became common in the [[interwar period]]. After [[World War II]], the spelling of the city's name was changed to ''Tîrgu Mureș'', following a 1953 [[spelling reform]] that [[Romanian alphabet#Î versus Â|replaced the letter ''â'' with ''î'']] in all words. Another spelling reform in 1993 [[Romanian alphabet#Î versus Â|replaced the letter ''î'' with ''â'']] in many words and the city's name has since been officially spelled "Târgu Mureș".

The first known recorded documentation of the city dates to 1332. It is mentioned in the [[Pope|papal]] registry under the Latin name ''Novum Forum Siculorum'' meaning ''New [[Székelys|Szekler]] Marketplace'', and under the Hungarian name ''Sekulvasarhel'' (Székelyvásárhely) meaning ''Szekler Marketplace'' in 1349.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Prior to 1332 a Dominican church stood where the [[Fortress Church, Târgu Mureș|Fortress' Church]] is now sited, up until the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]], when it was destroyed. The current Fortress' Church was built by the [[Franciscans]] in a new Gothic-style around 1332.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muzeumures.ro/main.php?object=staticpage&id=112&research_id=52 |title=Arheologie - Cercetare |access-date=2017-02-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222201613/http://www.muzeumures.ro/main.php?object=staticpage&id=112&research_id=52 |archive-date=22 February 2017}}</ref>

In 1405, the [[List of Hungarian rulers|King of Hungary]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] of [[Luxembourg]] granted the city the right to organize fairs. Since 1439 the town was the scene of the sessions of the Transylvanian parliament (diet) 36 times. In 1470 King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]] granted the first judicial privilege to the city, and in 1482 declared the city a royal settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mures.ro/site/index/cityHistory |title=Mures.ro - portalul tuturor muresenilor |access-date=2017-02-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222195546/https://www.mures.ro/site/index/cityHistory |archive-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> In 1492, [[Voivode|wayvoda]] (prince) [[Stephen V Báthory|István Báthory]] strengthened a monastery with fortifications.

In 1506, the troops of [[Pál Tomori]] were beaten by the [[Székelys]] who were rising against the payment of an extraordinary [[Ox tax]] imposed on them on occasion of the birth of [[Louis II of Hungary]]. In 1557, the Reformed Church College (i.e., [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]) was established as the oldest Hungarian school of Transylvania. In 1571, the session of the Transylvanian parliament under prince [[John II Sigismund Zápolya]] accepted the free preaching of the word of God, including by the Unitarian Church. In 1600–1601, as a result of the siege of [[Giorgio Basta]] under the direction of Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], the fortress crumbled to ruins.<ref name="Balázs Orbán">{{cite web|title=Székelyföld Leírása (The description of Szeklerland)|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/04800/04804/html/166.html|publisher=Mór Ráth|author=[[Balázs Orbán]]|access-date=25 October 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703054750/http://mek.oszk.hu/04800/04804/html/166.html|archive-date=3 July 2007}}</ref> In 1602, the troops of Gergely Németh put on fire the remaining houses of the town, therefore, in 1602 the reconstruction of the fortress was started on the advice of mayor [[Tamás Borsos]], but it was actually built between 1614 and 1653. [[Mózes Székely]] the only prince of Szekler origin visited the city in 1603 when he liberated Transylvania from foreign domination. In 1616, Târgu Mureș was granted the status of a free royal city under the name of Maros-Vásárhely by fejedelem (prince) [[Gábor Bethlen]].<ref name="Balázs Orbán" />

In 1658 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and Tartar troops invaded the city and burned it, where 3,000 people were taken into captivity. In 1661, as no one showed willingness to accept the duty of prince, under Turkish pressure [[Mihály Apafi]] was elected prince of Transylvania here. In 1662, resulting from the negligence of the Turkish military residing here, the city almost completely burnt down. In 1687 it was devastated by German imperial troops. In 1704, the [[kuruc]] troops of Pál Kaszás occupied the fortress, which was re-occupied by Austrian troops led by Lőrinc Pekry in 1706. On 5 April 1707 [[Francis II Rákóczi]] was raised to the chair of princes here. In 1707 the city was struck by the [[plague (disease)|plague]] with more than 3,500 deaths. The plague renewed in 1709, 1719 and in 1738–39.<ref name="Balázs Orbán" />

The city received a major boost to its social and economic life when it became home to the Supreme Court of Justice of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Principality of Transylvania]] in 1754. In 1802, the [[Teleki Library]] founded by count [[Sámuel Teleki (explorer)|Sámuel Teleki]] opened to the public with 40,000 volumes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Teleki-Bolyai Könyvtár |url=http://www.telekiteka.ro/index.php?m=teleki_bolyai_konyvtar |date=25 October 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616161849/http://www.telekiteka.ro/index.php?m=teleki_bolyai_konyvtar |archive-date=16 June 2009}}</ref>

[[Avram Iancu]], the leader of the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 Romanian revolution in Transylvania]], was a young lawyer in the city of Marosvásárhely before engaging in the fight for the rights of the Romanians living in Transylvania. On 4 November 1848, the Szekler troops were beaten by the Austrian imperial troops under its walls, and the city was also captured. On 13 January 1849 the troops of major Tolnay recaptured it. On 30 July 1849, [[Sándor Petőfi]] and [[Józef Bem]] set out from here for the [[Battle of Segesvár]]. Finally, the Austrian commander [[Karl von Urban]] captured the city on 2 August 1849, closing the chapter of the Revolutionary War in the city.

In 1854, Szekler martyrs Károly Horváth, János Török, and Mihály Gálfi were executed on the Postarét for plotting against Austrian rule.<ref name="Balázs Orbán"/> Since 1874 a monument marks the place. In 1861, Marosvásárhely became the seat of [[Marosszék]], in 1876 that of [[Maros-Torda County]]. In 1880 the statue of Bem was inaugurated in Roses Square, in downtown area; in 1893 the statue of [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] was as well. The statue of [[Francis II Rákóczi|Rákóczi]] was also inaugurated in 1907. All three statues were demolished between 1919 in 1923, after Transylvania became part of Romania.

The provincial appearance of the city changed greatly in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In 1913, the Hungarian Art-Nouveau style city hall complex and [[Palace of Culture (Târgu Mureș)|Palace of Culture]] was inaugurated, as part of mayor [[Bernády György]]'s urban renewal.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} After World War I, together with the rest of [[Transylvania]], Marosvásáshely became part of Romania and became known as ''Târgu Mureș''. From having been an 89% Hungarian-populated city (in 1910), the Romanian population increased throughout the second half of the 20th century.

From 1940 to 1944, as a consequence of the [[Second Vienna Award]], the city was ceded back to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After Hungary was occupied by Germany in 1944, a [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghetto]] was established in the city. Târgu Mureș re-entered the Romanian administration in October 1944. However, on 12 November 1944 General [[Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov]] of the Soviet [[Red Army]] expelled the returning Romanian authorities from [[Northern Transylvania]] with reference to the massacres committed by members of the so-called [[Maniu Guard]], and the Romanian authorities were not allowed to return until the government of [[Petru Groza]] was formed on 6 March 1945.<ref>{{cite web|title=A kisebbségpolitikus Márton Áron|url=http://www.hhrf.org/magyarkisebbseg/9501/m950118.html|publisher=Magyar Kiebbség|author=Vincze Gábor|access-date=25 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930133048/http://www.hhrf.org/magyarkisebbseg/9501/m950118.html|archive-date=30 September 2008}}</ref>

After World War II, the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist administration of Romania]] conducted a policy of massive industrialization that completely re-shaped the community. Between 1950 and 1968, Târgu Mureș was the center of the [[Magyar Autonomous Region]], later renamed as Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. On 7 September 1959, [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], Secretary-General of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Romanian Workers Party]], and [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Chivu Stoica]] visited the city.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} It was decided at the time where to build the fertilizer production plant, and the new residential quarters of the city. It was decided that the residential quarters would not be built in the Mureș valley, but on the surrounding hills.

In March 1990, shortly after the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Revolution of 1989]] overthrew the communist regime, the city was the [[Ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș|scene of violent ethnic clashes]] between [[Hungarian minority in Romania|ethnic Hungarians]] and ethnic [[Romanians]].

In the 21st century, the local economy started to get stronger after various investors settled in the area. In 2020 the city elected Independent candidate Zoltán Soós as mayor - the first ethnic Hungarian in twenty years.

[[File:Street_sign_in_Marosvásárhely.jpg|thumb|right|Bilingual street sign]]

According to the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]], Târgu Mureș had a population of 116,033, a decrease from the figure recorded at the [[2011 Romanian census|2011 census]].<ref name="recensamantromania.ro">{{cite web|url=https://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-rpl-2021/rezultate-definitive-caracteristici-etno-culturale-demografice/|title=Rezultate definitive: Caracteristici etno-culturale demografice|website=Recensamantromania.ro|access-date=28 July 2023}}</ref> The city is home to the largest urban Hungarian community in Transylvania, surpassing those of [[Sfântu Gheorghe]], [[Cluj-Napoca]] and [[Oradea]]. The 2002 census was the first to show the Hungarians as a local minority. The city is officially [[bilingual]] and both [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] languages are recognised as official and used in public signage, education, justice and access to public administration; however, in case of commercial signage and advertisements, the bilingual signage is usually used only by Hungarian-owned companies. Roma people make up 2.97% of the city's population, which is considerably lower than their proportion of 9.68% in [[Mureș County]].

===Places of worship===
[[File:Vártemplom éjjel.jpg|thumb|The [[Fortress Church, Târgu Mureș|Fortress Church]] is the oldest church in the town]]
[[File:Ferenc rendiek tornya1.JPG|right|thumb|The Grey Friars' church was demolished by the communist regime in 1971, with only the tower remaining (pictured)]]
The Reformed Fortress Church is the oldest church in the town. According to historical evidence, less than a century had passed after the first appearance of the Franciscan order in [[Transylvania]], [[Hungarian Kingdom]], that the Franciscan friars arrived at Vásárhely. The building of the church took an entire century, from the middle of the 14th century until the middle of the 15th and it consisted of a [[monastery]] building, an older chapel, the church and the steeple. The church was finalized between 1400 and 1450. The church may have been originally decorated with frescos, as traces of mural paintings were found inside. The almost complete disappearance of these paintings is due to the fact that the church became the property of Protestant believers in 1557. The religious reform required for churches to have no paintings, statues or religious frescos.

The existence of the Franciscan order in Vásárhely was directly affected by the religious reform which was largely spread in Transylvania during the 16th century. In 1557, the influence of the Reformed Church over the [[Hungarians]] in the town was so strong that it eventually led to the confiscation of the properties of Catholic monastic orders. Franciscan friars, who until that time had been attending the church in the fortress, were forced to leave town. They returned after nearly two centuries when the political climate had become favorable to Catholicism due to the instauration of the Habsburgs in Transylvania. They bought the land in the center of the town where they built a new church and monastery by 1777. The tower, the only part that is still standing, was added to the church's façade in 1802 by architect János Topler. In 1971 the municipality decided to demolish the monastery to create the necessary space for the construction of the National Theater and the square in front of it. A new church was built in 1972 for the Franciscans on Libertății street.

At the beginning of the 18th century, one of the most representative Baroque churches of [[Transylvania]] was built in the town. [[Saint John the Baptist Church, Târgu Mureș|St John the Baptist Church]] was erected in the North-Eastern part of the city center and belongs to the Roman Catholic parish. The inside of the church is luxurious, with liturgical objects that are true works of art. The main altar, made in 1755 by Anton Schuchbauer and Johannes Nachtigal is of monumental dimensions and has a pseudo-architectural structure. The paintings of the altars in the lateral chapels: [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary]], Saint Joseph, Saint John of Nepomuc, Holy Cross belong to the same Michael Angelo Unterberger. The stained glass windows made by the Türke Company of Grottau were installed in 1898.

The [[Status Quo Ante Synagogue (Târgu Mureș)|Great Synagogue]] (also known as the Big Synagogue) was built between 1899 and 1900 at the initiative of the Jewish community "Status Quo". The design of the building was drawn up by Gartner Jacob from Vienna and the construction works were coordinated by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] Pál Soós. The entire edifice is dominated by the central cupola. Each side of the central spire is decorated with a floral rosette similar to the ones on the façade. This type of window is also used several times on the lateral façades. The vast interior is richly decorated, both with shapes and color. The synagogue has 314 seats on the ground floor and 238 on the top floor. The most recent large scale remodeling of the building took place in 2000 when the walls were reinforced and the interior decoration was re-done.

The existence of the [[unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith in the town is linked to the name of [[Ferenc Dávid]], founder of Unitarianism and the first Unitarian bishop. The political circumstances in [[Transylvania]] became favourable for Ferenc Dávid's activity as the Diet of [[Turda|Torda]] held between 1557 and 1568 granted freedom of faith to all religions in [[Transylvania]]. The [[Unitarianism]] became religio-recepta together with all the other Protestant faiths. The king of the state himself, [[John II Sigismund Zápolya]] became Unitarian. The Unitarian Church was built between 1929 and 1930 next to the old Unitarian prayer house dating from 1869.

[[File:Palatul Culturii (Targu Mures).jpg|right|thumb|The [[Palace of Culture (Târgu Mureș)|Palace of Culture]] was built between 1911 and 1913.]]
The first fortress in the town was erected in 1492 upon order of [[Voivode of Transylvania|voivode]] [[Stephen Báthory]], and was accomplished somewhere between 1602 and 1652 under judge [[Tamás Borsos]]. Having a pentagon plan, surrounded by a defense wall, the Citadel has seven forts, five of them bearing the names of the guild which – according to tradition – supported its maintenance: the leather dressers', the tailors', the butchers', the ironmongers', the coopers'. After the Citadel was taken over by the Austrian troops, it became the headquarters of the military garrison based in the town. In the meantime the Baroque style building was built (on the left hand side of the road in front of the entrance gate) and in the second half of the 18th century the construction works of the "barkey" were started, an addition finished in the 19th century. On the occasion of the Târgu Mureș days – which have as central point of performance the Citadel – a museum center was opened in the gate fort (erected in 1613) presenting the history of the town and of the Citadel.

The [[Teleki Library|Teleki-Bolyai Library]] is a historic [[public library]] and current museum in the town. One of the richest [[Transylvania]]n collections of cultural artefacts, it was founded by the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] Count [[Sámuel Teleki (book collector)|Sámuel Teleki]] in 1802, at the time when Transylvania was part of the [[Habsburg monarchy]], and has been open to the reading public ever since. It was among the first institutions of its kind inside the Habsburg-ruled [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. It houses over 200,000 volumes, of which many are rarities, constituting a comprehensive scientific database. The book collection is divided into several smaller libraries, of which the two main donations are the original 40,000-volume Teleki Library and the 80,000-volume Bolyai Library; the rest, grouped as the ''Miscellaneous Collection'', is made up of several private libraries, volumes previously held by religious schools and those of a [[Franciscan]] friary. Overall, the library constitutes a collection of most traditional types of Transylvanian book.

The old City Hall was built in 1906–1907 after the construction plans of [[Márcell Komor]] and [[Dezső Jakab]]. The entrance area, including the corridor and the staircase leading to the first floor, is the most representative in this regard. The ribbed stellar vaults that cover this area were inspired by [[Gothic architecture]]. The vaults are supported by columns with composite caps, and the keystone is a large floral shape which includes the lighting appliance. The vaults are painted with spiraling vegetal motifs. Elements of the front hall include the stone bench with its legs shaped as those of an animal and with wing-shaped handles. Its shell-shaped, golden back has a shield flanked by two volutes on its upper side. Features of the monumental staircase leading to the first floor include the upper side of the banister resembling a slithering animal or a wave. The exterior decoration is simpler and is based on [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]-[[Székelys|Székely]] folk motives made of [[Zsolnay|polychromatic ceramics]]. The ground floor is marked by a solid, embossed pedestal. Windows with large openings tend to be predominant in the façade. The three semicircular windows in the middle area of the façade are those of the honor hall that has a double elevation with respect to the other rooms. The glass paintings which illustrated [[Gábor Bethlen]], [[Francis II Rákóczi]], [[Lajos Kossuth]], [[Ferenc Deák (politician)|Ferenc Deák]] and [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] are missing from the halls.

The [[Palace of Culture (Târgu Mureș)|Palace of Culture]] is a remarkable construction in the city center. It was built upon initiative of the mayor of the town, [[György Bernády]]. Building works started in the spring of 1911. They contributed to the establishment of the distinctively flavored [[Art Nouveau#Secession in Austria–Hungary|Hungarian Art Nouveau]] school in [[Transylvania]] by their works in [[Deva, Romania|Deva]] and [[Oradea]]. The plan is an irregular rectangle, with protuberances on the sides and at the extremities. The building has five floors: a tall ground floor, a mezzanine and three floors differentiated by the use of various construction materials. The façades are characterized by bi-dimensionality and by a liniar-rectangular style, with only a few curvilinear elements: the six bow-windows covered by semi-caps above the main portal and the circular balconies on the edges. The main entrance is in the middle of the façade on Enescu street and is made up of four massive doors, protected by an architectural element made of glass and with an iron framing. This element, as well as the doors decorated with iron floral motifs are typical for the early 20th century style. The exterior is richly decorated, with colored mosaic panels, with relieved scenes and busts of [[Hungarians]]. The mosaic on the main façade is an allegorical scene inspired by the Hungarian folklore. The cardboards were made by Nagy Sándor, a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] artist, who founded with [[Körösföy Kriesch Aladár]] the School of [[Gödöllő]]. The art is characterized by bi-dimensionality and vertical rhythmicalness. Most of the mosaics and stained glass windows were authored by Róth Miksa, particularly those on the side facing Square.

The city skyline can be seen from Cornești Heights [''in Hungarian: Somostető''].
