==History==
[[File:Salvio_Pacheco.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Concord was founded as "Todos Santos" in 1869 by [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Salvio Pacheco]], a noted [[Californio]] ranchero.]]
The valleys north of [[Mount Diablo]] were inhabited by the [[Miwok]] people, who hunted [[elk]] and fished in the numerous streams flowing from the mountain into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. It is important to note Miwok and other indigenous people still live within city limits. In 1772, Spanish explorers began to cross the area but did not settle there. In 1834, the Mexican land grant [[Rancho Monte del Diablo]] at the base of Mount Diablo was granted to Salvio Pacheco (for whom the nearby town of [[Pacheco, California|Pacheco]] is named).

Concord was founded under the name of Todos Santos ("all saints"; a name still borne by the central city plaza and park between Willow Pass Road and Salvio Street), on the initiative of Pacheco in 1869. It achieved prominence in the 19th century, when most residents of Pacheco relocated to Concord to avoid the devastation of fire and flood which crippled Pacheco's formerly booming economy. Concord was [[Incorporated town|incorporated]] on February 5, 1905.<ref>{{cite book |last = Harris |first = Joel A. |year = 2009 |title = Images of America: Concord |location = San Francisco |publisher = Arcadia Publishing |isbn = 978-0-7385-6913-0 }}</ref>

The area around Concord in the surrounding Ygnacio and Clayton valleys was a large agricultural area. The crops grown included grapes, walnuts, almonds, wheat, hay, and even tomatoes. The area to the east (now the site of the Concord Naval Weapons Station) was the site of a few enormous wheat ranches of over {{convert|5000|acre|km2|0}}, and was almost a sea of wheat all the way to the marshes bordering [[Suisun Bay]]. During [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], many vineyards were removed and replaced with walnut orchards. The town of [[Cowell, California|Cowell]], now incorporated into Concord, produced cement.

The first Concord post office opened in 1872.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|618}}</ref>

===Port Chicago disaster===
{{Main|Port Chicago disaster}}

The [[munition]]s on board a [[United States|Navy]] cargo ship exploded while being loaded during [[World War II]], resulting in the largest number of casualties among [[African American]]s in any one incident during that war. On the evening of July 17, 1944, a massive explosion instantly killed 320 sailors, merchant seamen, and civilians working at the pier. The blast was felt {{convert|30|mi|km}} away. A subsequent refusal by 258 black sailors to load any more ammunition was the beginning of the Navy's largest-ever mutiny trial, in which 50 men were found guilty. Future Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] sat in on most of the proceedings and declared that he saw a prejudiced court.<ref>{{cite book |last = Allen |first = Robert L. |year = 2006 |title = The Port Chicago Mutiny |publisher = [[Heyday Books]] |location = [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, CA]] |isbn = 978-1-59714-028-7 |oclc = 63179024 |page = 118 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2jl6cyAy6u8C |access-date = April 10, 2016 }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|30.5|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

The focal point of downtown Concord is Todos Santos Plaza, which encompasses an entire city block and is known for its [[farmers market]], free summer concerts, and large number of surrounding restaurants. Much of the area immediately around downtown has recently been redeveloped, with new high-density apartment and condominium projects to take advantage of the proximity to public transportation and to the area surrounding the park. Despite this, some crime and homelessness remain issues in the downtown area.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.ci.concord.ca.us/pdf/about/citynews/newsletter/citynews_sum08.pdf |title = Concord City News: Summer 2008 |access-date = November 24, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110609201502/http://www.ci.concord.ca.us/pdf/about/citynews/newsletter/citynews_sum08.pdf |archive-date = June 9, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.halfwaytoconcord.com/loaves-and-fishes-should-not-be-relocated-in-downtown-concord/ |title = Loaves and Fishes should not be relocated in downtown Concord |publisher = Halfwaytoconcord.com |date = November 6, 2007 |access-date = December 11, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130815033532/http://www.halfwaytoconcord.com/loaves-and-fishes-should-not-be-relocated-in-downtown-concord/ |archive-date = August 15, 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

==Naval Weapons Station==
{{Main|Concord Naval Weapons Station}}

[[File:CA Concord Naval Weapons Station aerial USA.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Concord Naval Weapons Station]]

To the north of the city of Concord is the [[Concord Naval Weapons Station]] (CNWS), which was established in 1942. The station functioned as a [[World War II]] [[armament]] storage [[Main Operating Base|depot]], supplying ships at [[Port Chicago, California|Port Chicago]]. The CNWS supported war efforts during the [[Vietnam War]] and through the end of the [[Gulf War]], processing and shipping out thousands of tons of material to [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]].<ref name="CNWS" />

The station consists of two areas: the inland area ({{convert|5170|acre|0|disp=sqbr|abbr=off|sp=us}}) which is within the Concord city limits, and tidal area ({{convert|7630|acre|0|disp=sqbr}}).<ref name="CityNWS">[http://www.concordreuseproject.org/about/index.htm About the City of Concord Community Reuse Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009204549/http://www.concordreuseproject.org/about/index.htm |date=October 9, 2007 }}, official city web site'.

Over-the-air reception is difficult in many parts of the city due to hills on either side of the valley.

The sole Concord-licensed TV station, [[KTNC-TV|KTNC]], gave up its broadcast frequency as part of the FCC reverse spectrum auction in 2017. It had broadcast on channel 42 from the top of Mount Diablo, but is now available on virtual channel 42 via a subchannel of KCNS channel 39.

Beyond MDUSD schools, [[Clayton Valley Charter High School]] is also home to several acclaimed academies. Catholic schools [[De La Salle High School (Concord, California)|De La Salle High School]] for boys and [[Carondelet High School]] for girls are also located here. De La Salle's football team holds the U.S. record winning streak of 151 games, set between 1992 and 2004. During that span, De La Salle won 12 California North Coast sectional championships and was named national champion five different times (once by [[ESPN]], four times by ''[[USA Today]]''). In August 2014, a Hollywood film titled ''[[When the Game Stands Tall]]'' was released with the plot line based on their 151-game winning streak.

In 1974, Concord became a sister city with [[Kitakami, Iwate|Kitakami]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], in [[Japan]]. The city established a small Japanese-style park in the city, and placed half of a sculpture, ''The Communion Bridge'', in it. The matching half of the bridge is in Kitakami.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ci.concord.ca.us/about/highlights/sistercity.htm |title = City of Concord Sister City |access-date = August 16, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921203124/http://www.ci.concord.ca.us/about/highlights/sistercity.htm |archive-date = September 21, 2008 }}</ref>

Every five years, a delegation from Concord visits Kitakami and operates a [[student exchange program]].<ref>{{Cite web |last = Ortega |first = Jennifer |date = July 29, 2020 |title = Concord Delegation to Visit Sister City in Kitakami, Japan |url = https://www.concordchamber.com/news/details/concord-delegation-to-visit-sister-city-in-kitakami-japan |website = Concord Chamber of Commerce |access-date = September 30, 2020 |archive-date = November 30, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201130041838/https://www.concordchamber.com/news/details/concord-delegation-to-visit-sister-city-in-kitakami-japan |url-status = dead }}</ref>
