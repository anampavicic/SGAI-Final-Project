'''Jhansi''' ({{IPA|hi|d͡ʒʱɑ̃ː.siː}} {{audio|Jhansi.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a historic city in the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Balwant Nagar was the old name of Jhansi. It lies in the region of [[Bundelkhand]], on the banks of the [[Pahuj River]], in the extreme south of Uttar Pradesh. Jhansi is the administrative headquarters of [[Jhansi district]] and [[Jhansi division]]. Also called the ''Gateway to Bundelkhand'', Jhansi is situated near and around the rivers Pahuj and [[Betwa River|Betwa]] at an average elevation of {{cvt|285|m}}. It is about {{convert|420|km|mi|0}} from national capital [[New Delhi]], 101 kilometres (62 mi) from [[Gwalior]] and {{convert|315|km}} from state capital [[Lucknow]].

Jhansi is well connected to all other major towns in [[Uttar Pradesh]] by road and railway networks. The [[National Highways Development Project]] has supported development of the city. Jhansi is also being developed as the defense corridor by the NDA government which will boost the economy of the city and the region at the same time. The [[Srinagar]] to [[Kanyakumari]] north–south corridor passes closely to Jhansi, as does the east–west corridor; consequently there has been a sudden rush of infrastructure and real estate development in the city. Jhansi was adjudged the third cleanest city of Uttar Pradesh and the fastest moving city in the North Zone in Swachh Survekshan 2018 rankings. The development of a [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] airport has been planned in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igovernment.in/site/uttar-pradesh-plans-develop-jhansi-airport-39569 |title=Uttar Pradesh plans to develop Jhansi airport |date=4 January 2011 |publisher=igovernment.in |access-date=3 September 2015

==Name==
According to Paul Whalley, the name ''Jhānsī'' means "covered in bushes or undergrowth", from a variant of standard Hindi ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/झाड़ jhāṛ]'' ("bushes, undergrowth"; ultimately from Sanskrit ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/झाट jhāṭa]''). The ending ''-sī'' represents a reduced form of the Sanskrit [[genitive case|genitive]] suffix ''-sya''.<ref name="Whalley 1922">{{cite journal |last1=Whalley |first1=Paul |title=Place-Names in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, Chapter III, Section 2: Suffixes |journal=The Journal of the United Provinces Historical Society |date=1922 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=52–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwdDAAAAYAAJ |access-date=22 July 2023}}</ref>{{rp|84-5}}

A fanciful old [[folk etymology]] for the name ''Jhānsī'' derives the name from Hindi ''jhāīṁ sī'', meaning "like a shadow" (or, in context, "rather indistinct"). This was supposedly said by the [[Jaitpur State|raja of Jaitpur]], when asked by his host [[Vir Singh Deo|Bir Singh Deo]] if he could see the fort at Jhansi from the rooftop of his palace in Orchha. (The Jaitpur raj was only founded well after Bir Singh's death, and the entire story is probably entirely spurious.)<ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|269}}<ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|1}}

==History==
[[File: The Fort, Jhansi, a gelatin silver photo, c.1900.jpg|thumb|left|Jhansi Fort, 1900]]

===Early history: Orchha and Mughal rule===
Before the construction of [[Jhansi Fort]] on the Bangra hill in 1613, the site is said to have been covered by forest.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 268 --> The land then belonged to the nearby village of [[Lahargird]], which itself belonged to the [[Orchha State|raja of Orchha]]'s territory.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 268 --> Two [[Ahir]] pastoralists supposedly set up some huts at the foot of the hill to watch over their herds around 1553.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 268 --> The Orchha raja [[Vir Singh Deo|Bir Singh Deo]] later had the fort built in 1613, and a village grew up around it.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 268 --> The village was apparently called Balwantnagar at first; when Jhansi became the name is unknown.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 268 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929">{{cite book |editor1-last=Drake-Brockman |editor1-first=D.

After the death of [[Jhujhar Singh]], Bir Singh's son and successor in Orchha, Jhansi came under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] control.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 268 --> Mughal troops and governors appear to have been posted here uninterrupted until the early 1700s.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 268 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|268}}

===Maratha rule===
In 1722, [[Chhatrasal]] overran the Jhansi region as part of his new kingdom of Bundelkhand.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 47 --> However, in 1728, [[Muhammad Khan Bangash]], the Nawab of [[Farrukhabad]], drove him out and the area came back under Mughal control.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 47 --> Chhatrasal appealed for help to [[Baji Rao I]], the [[Peshwa]] of the [[Maratha Empire]], and their combined forces drove out the Mughal army.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 47 --> In return, [[Chhatrasal]] granted Jhansi (among other places) to Baji Rao in his will when he died in 1731.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 47 --> In 1735, Raja Indargir Gosain, Maratha governor of Jhansi fort, rebelled and ultimately established a small principality based at [[Moth, Uttar Pradesh|Moth]] to the northeast.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 47 --> In 1742, the Peshwa put Naru Shankar in charge of Jhansi along with miscellaneous other places.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 47 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965">{{cite book |editor1-last=Joshi |editor1-first=Esha Basanti |title=Uttar Pradesh District Gazetteers: Jhansi |date=1965 |publisher=New Government Press |location=Lucknow |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ministry.08752 |access-date=31 May 2023}}</ref>{{rp|47}}

Naru Shankar's tenure as governor was pivotal in Jhansi's history. Up until now, Jhansi had been a fairly small village below the fort, but during this period it grew to become a large town.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 270 --> Naru Shankar undertook construction projects in the town, including a major expansion of the fort.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 270 --> He also populated Jhansi with deportees from other towns, primarily Orchha.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 270 --> (The rajas of Orchha moved their capital to [[Tikamgarh]] around this time, and [[Orchha|the town of Orchha itself]] rapidly declined.)<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 270 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|270}}

Naru Shankar was replaced as governor by Madho (or Madhaji) Gobind Antia in 1757.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 270 --><!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 48 --><!-- The 1929 Gazetteer has his name as "Madhaji Gobind Antia", while the 1965 one has "Madho Govind", the name used here is kind of a mixture of both --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|270}}<ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|48}} Antia constructed a reservoir known as the Antia Tal outside the city walls, on the [[Gwalior]] road.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 270 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|270}} Another governor, Babu Rao Kanahi, served after Antia but before 1761,<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 48 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|48}} when Ganesh Shambhaji is described as "the Maratha officer in charge of Jhansi".<!-- Srivastava 1939, p. 138 --> In November 1761, [[Shuja-ud-Daula]], the [[Nawab of Awadh]], had begun a military campaign in [[Bundelkhand]], and Ganesh Shambhaji decided to switch sides and join him.<!-- Srivastava 1939, p. 138 --> After what Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava describes as an "indiscriminate plunder of Jhansi" (he doesn't specify what this means), Ganesh Shambhaji jailed 52 of his Maratha colleagues and agreed to surrender Jhansi to Shuja-ud-Daula in return for a position in the Mughal service.<!-- Srivastava 1939, p. 138-9 --> After a detachment of Shuja-ud-Daula's captured the fortress of Moth, the Maratha governor of Jhansi (who Srivastava doesn't name) fearfully offered to submit and pay a 300,000-rupee tribute in return for being allowed to keep possession of the fort.<!-- Srivastava 1939, p. 139-40 --> Shuja-ud-Daula declined the offer and besieged the city.<!-- Srivastava 1939, p. 140 --> Its defenders surrendered on 1 February 1762.<!-- Srivastava 1939, p. 140 --> Shuja-ud-Daula appointed Muhammad Bashir as ''[[faujdar]]'' of the fort, and gave Ganesh Shambhaji the tax farm revenue for the district.<!-- Srivastava 1939, p. 140 --><ref name="Srivastava 1939">{{cite book |last1=Srivastava |first1=Ashirbadi Lal |title=Shujah-ud-Daulah, Volume I (1754-1765) |date=1939 |publisher=Midland Press |location=Calcutta |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.85274 |access-date=31 May 2023}}</ref>{{rp|138-40}}

The Mughal rule of Jhansi only lasted for four years before [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] recaptured it for the Marathas.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 48 --> Naru Shankar was apparently re-appointed governor; after his death, he was succeeded by Vishwas Rao Lachman for five years.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 48 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|48}}

===Newalkar dynasty===
{{main|Jhansi State}}
The next governor was [[Newalkar|Raghunath Rao Newalkar]].<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 48 --> In late 1773, Shuja-ud-Daula sent another force south of the [[Yamuna]], this time led by one Mir Naim, but they were defeated in a battle at Jhansi.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 49 --> Another Mughal-aligned force, led by Mirashgir, came to besiege Jhansi in late 1774, but the death of Shuja-ud-Daula in January 1775 resulted in the siege being abandoned.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 49 --> Raghunath Rao remained governor until his death in 1794; he had become practically independent by his death.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 49 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|48-9}} He was succeeded by his brother Sheo Rao Hari, also called Sheo Rao Bhao.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 271 --> Sheo Rao was responsible for the construction of the city walls, which took place between 1796 and 1814.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 271 --> The Lachhmi Talao reservoir on the east side of town is sometimes attributed to Sheo Rao as well, although it has also been attributed to Anupgir Gosain of Moth instead.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 271 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|271}}

Sheo Rao's descendants continued to rule what became known as [[Jhansi State]] until 1853.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 50-1 --> Sheo Rao himself signed the first treaty with the British in 1804, which established a military alliance between the two but still recognised Jhansi as a Maratha vassal.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 49-50 --> As part of the [[Treaty of Pune]] in 1817, overlordship was transferred from the Marathas to the British themselves.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 50 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|49-51}}

The final ruler of Jhansi State was [[Gangadhar Rao]], who ruled from 1842 to 1853.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 50-1 --> Gangadhar Rao was a patron of the arts and a capable administrator.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 51 --> His only son died in infancy, so before he died, he and his wife [[Lakshmi Bai]] adopted a five-year-old boy named [[Damodar Rao of Jhansi|Damodar Rao]] to serve as his successor.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 51 --> Although this was accepted practice in Hindu law, the British did not recognise Damodar Rao as a valid heir and, invoking the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], declared that Jhansi State had [[escheat]]ed to the British government.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 51 --> Lakshmi Bai appealed to the British court of directors, but to no avail, and in March 1854 the British took control of Jhansi.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 51-2 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|50-2}}

The newly-appointed British superintendent of Jhansi, [[Francis D. Gordon|Francis Gordon]], wrote a report in 1854 documenting the state of the town at that time.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 276 --> He estimated that it had a population of 40,000 people.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 276 --> It was not an industrial centre of any kind, but he wrote that its commercial traffic was "enormous"; he estimated that 3 million rupees' worth of goods passed through Jhansi per year.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 276 --> Large amounts of grain, coming from farmland to the south and southwest, passed through Jhansi on its way north.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 276 --> Cotton was brought from the west and then transported north to [[Kalpi]].<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 276 --> Salt also came from the west.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 276 --> In exchange, the merchants from the south and west bought sugar and various ''[[kirana store|kirana]]'' goods to sell back home.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 276 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|276}}

From 1853 to 1861, a [[cantonment]] was built on the southeast side of town.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 347 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|347}}

===Rebellion of 1857===
{{see also|Indian Rebellion of 1857}}
Several factors had contributed to tensions in Jhansi before the rebellion broke out. Besides the British annexation of Jhansi State, various other members of the landed aristocracy were upset by the British encroaching on their traditional authority.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 55 --> Local residents were also upset by the fact that the British had permitted cow slaughter after they took over Jhansi (it had previously been banned).<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 55 --> Another grievance was that the British had suspended endowments to the temple of Mahalakshmi (the patron goddess of the Newalkar dynasty) which had previously come from revenue collected from certain villages.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 55 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|55}}

At this point the garrison was composed entirely of Indian troops, and it consisted of five infantry companies, a cavalry force, and an artillery detachment, all commanded by British officers.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 209 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|209}}

Tensions boiled over on 5 June. That afternoon, one company of the Jhansi infantry along with the artillery detachment surrounded and entered the star fort and magazine, under the pretext of an attack by dacoits.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 56 --> They announced their intention to garrison the star fort themselves.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 209 --> Most of the British civilians took shelter in the regular fort.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 209 --> The remaining four infantry companies along with the cavalry had not joined in at this point,<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 209 --> and that they night slept in the barracks without incident.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 56 --> The next day, however, most of them rose up and attacked and killed the British officers on site.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 209-10 --> They made their way to the main fort, which the rebels encircled and besieged.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 56 --> This was short-lived and on the 7th the British surrendered.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 211 --> They were marched south to the Jokhan Bagh, just outside the city walls, and executed.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 211 --><!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 57 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|56-7}}<ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|209-11}}

====Lakshmi Bai's reign====
On the 9th, there was a dispute between Lakshmi Bai and Sada Sheo Rao, a relative of her late husband, over who would rule in Jhansi, with both of them "bidding against each other" to win the support of the rebels.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 212 --> Lakshmi Bai offered much more and the rebels handed control of Jhansi to her.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 212 --> A proclamation was made saying "The people are God's, the country is the Padishah's, and the raj is Rani Lakshmi Bai's".<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 57 --> Sada Sheo Rao assembled a force of 300 supporters, seized the fort of [[Karahra]] on 13 June, and attempted to proclaim himself ruler of Jhansi, but Lakshmi Bai sent troops after him and ultimately had him imprisoned and detained.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 212 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|57}}<ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|212}}

Her position now secure, Lakshmi Bai set up an administration in Jhansi. She set up a mint, raised an army, and strengthened the forts at Jhansi and Karahra.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 212 --> Attempting to stay on good terms with the British, she sent a letter to a British agent named Major Erskine saying that she had only aided the rebels under duress, disavowing the massacre of British prisoners, and presenting herself as just a caretaker until the British could reoccupy the area.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 58 --><!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 212 --> Erskine responded by giving her full authorisation to rule on behalf of the British until their troops arrived and sent a proclamation that all were to obey her; he assured her that she would be treated well.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 58 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|58}}<ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|212}}

Meanwhile, the raja of Orchha, hoping to recover ancestral territories that had been conquered by the Marathas in the 1700s, invaded Jhansi.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 217 --> He presented himself to the British as a loyal ally of theirs fighting to suppress the rebellious rani of Jhansi.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 217 --> His troops looted the countryside and besieged Jhansi on 3 September.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 217 --> He lifted the siege on 22 October as reinforcements under the raja of Banpur came to assist the defenders.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 217 --> In early 1858, Lakshmi Bai finally drove the Orchha troops out of her territory, and had consolidated her control over all the territory that had belonged to Jhansi State before the British annexation.<!-- 1929 Gazetteer, p. 217 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1929"/>{{rp|217}}

As late as February 1858, Lakshmi Bai pledged loyalty to the British and sent them multiple letters promising to hand over Jhansi without a fight if they treated her honourably.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 62 --> However, governor-general [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Charles Canning]] had never wanted to follow through with Erskine's earlier proposition, and he considered the rani a rebel against British authority.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 62 --> On 11 February, Canning sent a letter to the British agent at [[Indore]] with instructions to try Lakshmi Bai before a special commission if captured.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 62 --> Lakhsmi Bai decided that she couldn't trust the British and her only option was to fight them.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 62 --> On 14 February, she issued a proclamation urging both Hindus and Muslims to take up arms against the British because "they would surely destroy the people's religion".<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 62 --> At her disposal were 12,000 troops, including 400 cavalry and about 40 artillery pieces.<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 62 --> She also made negotiations with rebel leaders including [[Tantya Tope]].<!-- 1965 Gazetteer, p. 62 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1965"/>{{rp|62}}

===Independent India===
After the [[Independence Day (India)|independence of India]], Jhansi was included in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]].

==Geography and climate==
Jhansi is located at 25.4333 N 78.5833 E. It has an average elevation of 284 metres (935&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Jhansi.html|title=Jhansi, India Page|publisher=fallingrain.com|access-date=3 September 2012}}</ref> Jhansi lies on the plateau of central India, an area dominated by rocky relief and minerals underneath the soil. The city has a natural slope in the north as it is on the south western border of the vast ''[[Tarai]]'' plains of Uttar Pradesh and the elevation rises on the south. The land is suitable for species of [[citrus fruit]] and crops include wheat, pulses, peas, and oilseeds. The region relies heavily on [[monsoon]] the rains for irrigation purposes. Under an ambitious canal project (the Rajghat canal), the government is constructing a network of canals for irrigation in Jhansi and Lalitpur and some part of Madhya Pradesh. The trade in agricultural products (including grain and oilseeds) is of great economic importance.<ref>''The Macmillan Encyclopedia''; rev. ed. London: Macmillan, 1983; p. 647</ref> The city is also a centre of brassware manufacture.<ref>Moore, W. G. (1971) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Places''. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 371</ref>

Translation: "From the bards of Bundela we have heard this story / She fought valiantly like a warrior woman, she was the queen of Jhansi."

For Marathi people there is an equally well-known ballad about the brave queen penned at the spot near Gwalior where she died in battle, by B. R. Tambe, who was a poet laureate of Maharashtra and of her clan. A couple of stanzas run like this:
{{blockquote|रे हिंदबांधवा, थांब या स्थळीं अश्रु दोन ढाळीं /
  ती पराक्रमाची ज्योत मावळे इथे झाशिवाली /
  ... /
  घोड्यावर खंद्या स्वार, हातात नंगि तर्वार /
  खणखणा करित ती वार /
  गोर्‍यांची कोंडी फोडित पाडित वीर इथे आली /
  मर्दानी झाशीवाली!}}

Translation: "You, denizen of this land, pause here and shed a tear or two / For this is where the flame of the valorous lady of Jhansi was extinguished / … / Astride a stalwart stallion / With a naked sword in hand / She burst open the British siege / And came to rest here, the brave lady of Jhansi!"

===Jhansi in literature===
{{See also|Rani of Jhansi#Literature, film & television}}
Two novels by [[John Masters]] are set in the fictional town of Bhowani. According to the author, writing in the glossary to the earlier novel, ''[[Nightrunners of Bengal]]'', Bhowani is an "imaginary town. To get a geographical bearing on the story it should be imagined to be about where Jhansi really is - 25.27 N., 78.33 E."<ref>Masters, John. ''Nightrunners of Bengal''. (London and New York, 1951). Glossary.</ref> ''Nightrunners of Bengal'' is set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at "Bhowani" (the title alludes to the mysterious distribution of "chapatis" to village headmen which preceded the revolt). ''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' is set in 1946/47 the eve of independence. In each novel the main character is a British army officer named Colonel Rodney Savage, one of a succession of such men from the same family.

[[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a short poem about the fate of the Skene family at Jhansi during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. It is entitled "In the Round Tower at Jhansi - 8 June 1857". It was published in 1862 in the same volume as her more celebrated poem "Goblin Market". Some time afterward, Rossetti discovered that she had been misinformed about the husband and wife's suicide pact in the face of a murderous and implacable enemy ('The swarming howling wretches below' the tower walls) which is the poem's subject, but did not delete it from later editions. Jhansi is the centre of story in Vrindavan Lal Verma's Hindi novel 'Jhansi Ki Rani'.  This novel tells the story of Jhansi ki Rani Lakshmibai, who fought bravely in 1858–59 to save Jhansi from the Britishers' attack.
