Shillong has steadily grown in size since it was made the civil station of the [[Khasi Hills|Khasi]] and [[Jaintia Hills]] in 1864 by the [[British Raj|British]]. In 1874, on the formation of [[Assam]] as the Chief Commissioner's Province, Shillong was chosen as the headquarters of the new administration because of its convenient location between the [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Surma River|Surma]] valleys and more so because the climate of Shillong was much cooler than tropical India.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Shillong |title=Shillong {{!}} India |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref> Shillong remained the capital of [[undivided Assam]] until the creation of the new state of Meghalaya on 21 January 1972, when Shillong became the capital of Meghalaya, and Assam moved its capital to [[Dispur]] in [[Guwahati]].

==Etymology==
Shillong is named after the god of the Khasis, "U Blei Shyllong". The more widespread belief is that Shillong was named after a boy named “Aahlad” who was born to a virgin mother near Bisi.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2023}}
Shillong was the capital of composite [[Assam]] during the British regime and later until a separate State of [[Meghalaya]] was formed. David Scott, the British civil servant of the [[East India Company]], was the Agent of the Governor-General North East Frontier. During the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] the British authorities felt the need for a road to connect [[Sylhet]] and Assam. The route was to traverse across the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. David Scott overcame the difficulties his administration faced from the opposition of the Khasi Syiems – their chiefs and people. Impressed by the favourable cool climate of [[Khasi Hills]], they negotiated with the Syiem of Sohra in 1829 for a sanatorium for the British. Thus began the consolidation of British interests in the Khasi-Jaintia Hills.

In early 1829, a [[Khasi people|Khasis]] confederation mounted a serious uprising against British occupation. But by January 1833, their leader [[Tirot Sing]] surrendered to David Scott and was  detained to Dacca (present-day [[Dhaka]]). A political agent was posted in Sohra, also known as [[Cherrapunjee]]. 

But the British did not like the climate and facilities of Sohra and they moved to Shillong. "Ïewduh" is the biggest market in Shillong. The name "Shillong" was later adopted, as the location of the new town was below the Shillong Peak.

In 1874, a separate Chief Commissionership was formed with Shillong as the seat of administration. The new administration included [[Sylhet]], now a part of [[Bangladesh]]. Also included in the Chief Commissionership were the [[Naga Hills]] (present-day [[Nagaland]]), [[Lushai Hills]] (present-day [[Mizoram]]) as well as Khasi, Jaintia and Garo Hills. Shillong was the capital of composite Assam till 1969 when the autonomous state of Meghalaya was formed. In January 1972, Meghalaya was made a full-fledged state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Syiemlieh|first1=David R.|title=Reflections From Shillong: Speeches of M.M. Jacob (Volume 3)|date=2005|publisher=Daya Books|isbn=8189233297}}</ref>

The Shillong Municipal Board dates back to 1878, when a proclamation was issued constituting Shillong and its suburbs, including the villages of Mawkhar and Laban, into a station under the Bengal Municipal Act of 1876. Inclusion of the villages of Mawkhar (S.E. Mawkhar, Jaiaw and part of Jhalupara and Mawprem) and Laban (Lumparing, Madan laban, Kench's Trace and Rilbong) within the Municipality of Shillong was agreed to by Haiñ Manik Syiem of Mylliem under the agreement of 15 November 1878.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smb.gov.in/history.html |title=Shillong Municipal Board – History |publisher=Shillong Municipal Board|access-date=21 May 2014}}</ref> But, there is no trace of Shillong in the British era maps dating back to 1878, up to 1900.

The [[1897 Assam earthquake|great earthquake]] of 12 June 1897 of [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] 8.1 killed 27 from Shillong and destroyed much of the town.

==Geography==
[[File:Aerial view of Shillong Meghalaya India.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Aerial view of Shillong]]
Shillong is at {{Coord|25.57|N|91.88|E|}}. It lies on the [[Shillong Plateau]], the only major uplifted structure in the northern Indian shield.<ref>Bilham, R. and P. England, Plateau pop-up during the great 1897 Assam earthquake. ''Nature''(Lond),410, 806–809, 2001</ref> The city lies in the centre of the plateau and is surrounded by hills, three of which are revered in Khasi tradition: Lum Sohpetbneng, Lum Diengiei, and Lum Shyllong.

Shillong is just {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Guwahati]], which can be accessed by road along [[NH 40]], a journey of about 2 hours 30 minutes through lush green hills and the [[Umiam lake]] in between.

===Smart Cities Mission===
Shillong has been selected as the 100th city to receive funding under the centre's flagship "Smart Cities Mission" [[Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation]] (AMRUT). In January 2016, 20 cities were announced under the Smart Cities Mission, followed by 13 cities in May 2016, 27 cities in September 2016, 30 cities in June 2017, and 9 cities in January this year. The total proposed investment in the finally selected 100 cities under the Smart Cities Mission would be {{INR}} 2,050,180 million. Under the scheme, each city will get {{INR}} 5000 million from the centre for implementing various projects.

==Transport==
Although well connected by road, Shillong has neither rail connections nor a proper air connection. [[Umroi Airport]] located {{convert|30|km|miles|0}} from the city centre has only limited flights.

===Roadways===
[[File:Shillong Bypass road.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shillong [[Bypass (road)|Bypass road]]]]

Shillong is well connected by roads with all major northeastern states. Three major National Highways pass through:
*[[National Highway 6 (India)]] – Connected to [[Guwahati]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]]
*[[National Highway 106 (India)]]  - Connected to [[Nongstoin]]
*[[National Highway 206 (India)]]  - Connected to [[Dawki]]

Private bus operators, as well as state transport buses from other states, come to and from Shillong daily. Taxi services are also available to destination like [[Guwahati]], [[Agartala]], [[Kohima]], [[Dimapur]], [[Aizawl]] and other North Eastern towns and cities.

The Shillong Bypass ''(pictured)'' is a two lane road which stretches across {{convert|47.06|km|miles|1}} connecting Umiam (NH-40) to Jorabat (NH-44) which then leads to other northeastern Indian states of [[Mizoram]] and [[Tripura]]. The project was estimated to have cost around {{INRConvert|220|c}} and was completed in a span of two years (2011–2013).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/gadkari-to-inaugurate-shillong-bypass/articleshow/47109056.cms|title=Gadkari to inaugurate Shillong Bypass|work=[[The Economic Times]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|date=30 April 2015|access-date=1 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/gadkari-inaugurate-shillong-bypass-today-030615157.html|title=Gadkari to inaugurate Shillong bypass today|author=ANI|publisher=[[Yahoo!

*'''Shillong Golf Course''': Shillong has one of the largest natural golf courses in Asia: Gleneagles of the East. It enjoys the rare distinction of being one of the few natural golf courses in Asia. Not only is the Shillong Golf Course scenic and enjoyable, it is also challenging. A group of British civil service officers introduced golf to Shillong in 1898 by constructing a nine-hole course. The present 18-hole course was inaugurated in 1924. The course is set in a valley covered with pine and rhododendron trees. The tight fairways, carpeted with a local grass which hardens the soil, are difficult to negotiate. The number of out-of-bounds streams that criss-cross every fairway makes it all the more trying. Obstructions come in the form of bunkers, trees and rain. The longest hole is the 6th, which is a gruelling 594 yards. Shillong Golf Course is considered to be the "[[Gleneagles Hotel|Glen Eagle]] of the East" at the [[United States Golf Association Museum]]. It was set in a valley at an altitude of 5,200&nbsp;ft in 1898 as a nine-hole course and later converted into an 18-hole course in 1924 by Captain Jackson and [[C. K. Rhodes]].
*'''Motphran''': The "Monument of France" which is locally known as "Motphran" was erected in memory of the 26th Khasi Labour Corps who served under the British in France during World War I.

*'''Shillong Peak''': A picnic spot, 10&nbsp;km from the city, 1966 m above sea level, offers a panoramic view of the scenic countryside and is the highest point in the state.
