{{nihongo|'''Iizuka'''|飯塚市|Iizuka-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]].  {{As of |2024|02|29}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 124,757 in 63833 households, and a  [[population density]] of 580 persons per km².<ref name="Iizuka-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.iizuka.lg.jp/shiminkanri/jinko27-01.htmll|title= Iizuka City official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{cvt|213.96|km2}}.

==Geography==
Iizuka is the central city of the Chikuho region located in the center of Fukuoka Prefecture, approximately 35 kilometers east of Fukuoka City and approximately 40 kilometers southwest of the center of Kitakyushu City. The [[Onga River]], a first-class river, flows through the central part of the city, and the area forms an urban area. From the northwestern part of the city to the western and southwestern parts of the city, there are mountains ranging in height from 400 to 900 meters, including Mt. Mikoriyama (935.9 meters) and Mt. Toishi (828 meters). There are also several mountains in the eastern part of the city that are between 200 and 300 meters high, forming a small mountain range. Therefore, the central and northern parts of the city are a basin surrounded by mountains. Yagiyama Pass and Shokegoe on the western edge of the city, and Hiyomizu Pass on the southern edge of the city were difficult areas for transportation until roads were developed.

==History==
The area of Iizuka was part of ancient [[Chikuzen Province]]. Rice has been cultivated in the fertile alluvial plains of the Onga River system since the [[Yayoi Period]], and ancient [[kofun]] are scattered throughout the area.  During the [[Edo Period]] it was part of the holdings of [[Fukuoka Domain]]. After the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Iizuka was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Iizuka was raised to city status on January 20, 1932.  On March 26, 2006, Iizuka absorbed the towns of [[Chikuho, Fukuoka|Chikuho]], [[Honami, Fukuoka|Honami]], [[Kaita, Fukuoka|Kaita]] and [[Shōnai, Fukuoka|Shōnai]] (all from [[Kaho District, Fukuoka|Kaho District]]) to create the new and expanded city of Iizuka. 

==Government==
Iizuka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Iizuka, together with the town of Keisen contributes two members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Fukuoka 8th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
Iizuka was an important post-station on the [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] [[Kaidō]] during the [[Edo]] Era. As [[Japan]] industrialised, Iizuka became the center of the most productive [[coal]] fields in Japan located throughout the surrounding Chikuho district. After the end of [[Second World War]] there was a large influx of people into the city as it was one of the few areas that offered a large number of jobs in the coal mines and related fields. Since the coal mines closed, Iizuka City has suffered from a consistently declining population base. However, its proximity to both [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] City and [[Kitakyushu]] City cushioned the effect of the coal industry shutdown and kept the local economy from going into freefall. Now Iizuka has a strong light industrial base and is a center for [[education]] and a rapidly expanding [[Information Technology|IT]] economy.

==Education==
Iizuka has 22 public elementary schools and 9 public junior high schools operated by the city government and one private elementary and one private junior high school. There are one public junior high school and two public high schools  operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education, and also two private high schools. The prefecture also operates two schools for the handicapped. [[Kindai University]] has a junior college in Iizuka.
