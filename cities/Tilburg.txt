Little is known about the beginnings of Tilburg. The name ''Tilliburg'' first appeared in documents dating from AD 709,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oorkondenboek der Graafschappen Gelre en Zutfen tot op den Slag van Woeringen, 5 Juni 1288|last=Baron Sloet|first=L. A. J. W.|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1872|location=s'Gravenhage|pages=3 (no. 2)}}</ref> but after that there was no mention for several centuries. In the later Middle Ages, Tilburg referred to a region rather than a particular town or village; its population was largely in a couple of hamlets, one of which was known as "Eastern Tilburg" (''Oost-Tilburg''), which was later reflected in the name ''Oisterwijk'' ("Eastern Quarter"). This village centred around a small (probably wooden) castle or ''Motteburcht'' on an equally small hill, which became derelict and was torn down after a few centuries at most. Of this first "Tilburg Castle", nothing remained c.&nbsp;2000, except for a few remnants of its [[moat]] in the suburbs of Oisterwijk. In the 14th century, Tilburg was proclaimed a [[Manorialism|manor]]; together with [[Goirle]], it acquired the title of "The Manor of Tilburg and Goirle".

Successively, the manorial rights fell into the hands of several lords of noble lineage. They derived their income from taxes, [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and [[interest]] paid by the villagers.

In the 15th century, one of the lords of Tilburg, Jan van Haestrecht, built Tilburg Castle. "That stone chamber at Hasselt" is mentioned in several historical documents. In 1858, however, the castle was pulled down to make way for a factory, but the name lives on, in the city arms and logo. A replica of the foundations of the castle was restored in {{circa|1995}} in its original location, after the factory was demolished. In 1803, Goirle was separated from Tilburg and on 18 April 1809, Tilburg was granted [[City rights in the Netherlands|city status]]. In that year, it had about 9,000 inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 2009 Tilburg hosted several festivities in celebration of 200 years as a city.{{vague|date=April 2015}}

=== Wool capital of the Netherlands ===
Tilburg grew around one of the so-called "herd places" or "Frankish triangles", triangular plots where a number of roads (usually sand roads) met. These herd places were collective [[pasture]]lands for flocks of [[domestic sheep|sheep]]. Their shape is still reflected in the layout of many places in Tilburg. Many districts, including Korvel, Oerle, Broekhoven, Hasselt, Heikant, De Schans, and Heuvel, bear the names of these old [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]]. The poor farmers living in these hamlets soon decided not to sell the [[wool]] from their [[sheep]] but to [[weaving|weave]] it themselves, and for a long time, much of the space inside their small houses was occupied by a [[loom]]—by the 17th century these numbered about 300. Enterprising people saw their chance. As so-called "drapers", they supplied the weavers with the raw materials for their "home working", and the first Tilburg "mill houses" came into existence. From then on, the wool industry underwent rapid growth, and in 1881 Tilburg had as many as 145 wool mills. Home weaving continued, however, until the early 20th century. Woollen textiles from Tilburg were known far and wide.

After [[World War&nbsp;II]] Tilburg retained its place as wool capital of the Netherlands, but in the 1960s the industry collapsed and by the 1980s the number of operating wool mills had declined. Present-day Tilburg industry consists of a wide variety of enterprises. The main economic sector has become transport and logistics with a variety of industry as a close second.

=== Urban renewal ===
When the wool industry collapsed in the 1960s, Cees Becht was the mayor of Tilburg. While he was in office, many old buildings were destroyed, including some precious monuments. The Koningswei neighbourhood (King's Meadows) was demolished and replaced by Koningsplein (King's Square). The reason for demolishing the neighbourhood was to replace slum with modern building. The new development, however, has not been successful and many feel that the square feels abandoned most of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nai.nl/museum/tentoonstellingen/digitaal/strijd_om_de_stad/item_sos/_pid/kolom2-1/_rp_kolom2-1_elementId/1_647132 |title=Nederlands Architectuurinstituut - Item_sos - Koningswei Tilburg |publisher=Nai.nl |access-date=24 June 2014 |archive-date=3 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103095248/http://www.nai.nl/museum/tentoonstellingen/digitaal/strijd_om_de_stad/item_sos/_pid/kolom2-1/_rp_kolom2-1_elementId/1_647132 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Considered even worse was the demolition of the old city hall. This classicistic-styled building was a national-registered monument, but even that did not stop Becht's plans to demolish it to build the nine-storey, modern-day, black complex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaalarchieftilburg.nl/wiki/Stadhuis |title=Stadhuis - Tilburg Wiki |language=nl |publisher=Regionaalarchieftilburg.nl |date=26 February 2014 |access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref> A part of the empty area was used to build the system of the inner ''Cityring''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geheugenvantilburg.nl/component/option,com_raadplegen/Itemid,11/id,803/ |title= Het Geheugen van Tilburg - de gemeentehuizen van Tilburg|website=www.geheugenvantilburg.nl |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222203536/http://www.geheugenvantilburg.nl/component/option,com_raadplegen/Itemid,11/id,803/ |archive-date=22 February 2013}}</ref> Another building that was demolished was the old railway station, which was replaced due to ''Hoogspoor'' (literally: high rails), a project bringing the railway on viaducts to reduce traffic congestion around 1960. The century-old station building was replaced by the modern one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaalarchieftilburg.nl/wiki/Hoogspoor |title=Hoogspoor - Tilburg Wiki |language=nl |publisher=Regionaalarchieftilburg.nl |date=26 November 2013 |access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref> Because of all of this and some more parts of Tilburg, Cees Becht gained the dubious nickname ''Cees de Sloper'' (Cees the demolisher).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geheugenvantilburg.nl/component/option,com_raadplegen/Itemid,9/id,387/ |title= Het Geheugen van Tilburg - Cees J.G.

=== Modern history ===
In the 1980s, many locations, formerly occupied by wool factories had been filled with small-scale housing projects. This mostly happened when Henk Letschert was mayor of Tilburg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaalarchieftilburg.nl/wiki/Henk_Letschert |title=Henk Letschert - Tilburg Wiki |language=nl |publisher=Regionaalarchieftilburg.nl |date=16 April 1975 |access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref> The ''Heuvel'', one of the important squares, had its own [[Tilia|lime tree]] until 27 April 1994, being chopped for a bicycle parking basement. The felling led to many protests, because the tree was still healthy. After the Pieter Vreedeplein reconstruction, plans were made to plant a descendant of the original lime tree. Three were placed, only one of them survived. The last living tree was moved to another location again,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2011-03-30|title=Linde 17 jaar na dato terug mét hek|url=http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/linde-17-jaar-na-dato-terug-met-hek-1.78709|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909061851/http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/linde-17-jaar-na-dato-terug-met-hek-1.78709|archive-date=9 September 2011|access-date=|website=[[Brabants Dagblad]]}}</ref> but died shortly after. As of 23 November 2011, no more descendants have been placed. The current one is just another lime tree.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2011-11-22|title=Laatste dag voor dode linde op Heuvel|url=https://www.bd.nl/tilburg/laatste-dag-voor-dode-linde-op-heuvel~a6824582/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-03|website=[[Brabants Dagblad]]}}</ref> In the 1990s Tilburg developed a modern skyline. Because of new policy three buildings were built, which are considered skyscrapers in the Netherlands. These are the [[Interpolis]] headquarters, the [[Westpoint Tower]] and [[StadsHeer]]. The Westpoint Tower has an altitude of {{convert|143.1|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} and was the tallest residential tower in The Netherlands until the [[Montevideo (Rotterdam)|Montevideo]] in Rotterdam surpassed it. The 'StadsHeer' is the third one and is part of the 'Haestrechtkwartier' (Haestrecht quarter). The residential tower is nicknamed ''De Vogelkooikes'' (The Bird Cages) for its cubic balconies taped{{clarify|reason=Translation problem. No kind of tape is strong enough to hold up a balcony.|date=May 2017}} onto the building.

=== King William II ===
[[William II of the Netherlands|King William&nbsp;II]] (1792–1849) was fond of Tilburg. "Here I can breathe freely and I feel happy", he once said about the town. King William&nbsp;II always supported Tilburg—he provided money to improve the sheep breeding, built new farms and founded a [[cavalry]] barracks on St.&nbsp;Joseph Street, now a monumental building of the City [[Archive]]s. Although the King was always made welcome by the manufacturers he had befriended, he needed his own residence in Tilburg, and commissioned the construction of a [[City Hall of Tilburg|palace]], which would function as his country residence. Construction started in 1847 and was completed just days before William II died, in 1849. It is now part of [[City Hall of Tilburg|Tilburg City Hall]]. In 1987 an [[obelisk]] was erected nearby, in memory of King William&nbsp;II. It replaced the old "needle" dating from 1874, which was removed from the street in 1968. After its restoration, William&nbsp;II's statue has got a place again in the heart of the city, where he felt happy among its inhabitants. The local football club [[Willem&nbsp;II Tilburg]] was named after the king.

=== Tilburg Centrum ===
[[File:Map - NL - Tilburg - Wijk 00 Centrum.svg|thumb|64px|Location of Tilburg-Centrum]]

Tilburg Centrum is the downtown of Tilburg, and is situated between (clockwise) the Spoorlaan, Heuvelring, Paleisring, Schouwburgring and Noordhoekring, which is the same as the order of the one-way roads around the district. The district has 6,572 inhabitants, and most of the shops, hotels, restaurants and cafes of the city. In 2008, the refurbished Pieter Vreedeplein was opened to the public, addressing a lack of shopping facilities as compared to similar-sized cities in the Netherlands. Two smaller cinemas were replaced by a bigger one on the Pieter Vreedeplein in 2007. Despite being called ''Centrum'', the district is some distance southeast of the geographical center. The district is connected by the [[Tilburg railway station]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tilburg.nl/fileadmin/files/actueel/tilburg_in_cijfers/18-230-INF-Tilburg-in-cijfers-2018-DEF-juni-zonder_snijtekens.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.tilburg.nl/fileadmin/files/actueel/tilburg_in_cijfers/18-230-INF-Tilburg-in-cijfers-2018-DEF-juni-zonder_snijtekens.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=Tilburg in Cijfers -2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

When the [[Classification yard|railway marshalling yard]] belonging to the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] became obsolete, a considerable stretch of the railway across the city, the ''[[Spoorzone (Tilburg)|Spoorzone]]'', became an [[urban renewal]] project. New premises for two courses run by [[Fontys University of Applied Sciences]] will be located here, as will Tilburg's new central library, replacing the library in Koningsplein.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/klein-deel-fontys-en-bibliotheek-naar-spoorzone-1.137578 |title=News about the settling institutes (Dutch, 19-01-2012) |publisher=bd.nl |access-date=24 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525231636/http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/klein-deel-fontys-en-bibliotheek-naar-spoorzone-1.137578 |archive-date=25 May 2012  }}</ref> The railway yard is the largest area, though more areas along the railway will be reconstructed.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [https://archive.today/20120915052345/http://www.tilburgspoorzone.nl/Home "Tilburg Spoorzone" website] (Website about the Spoorzone being reconstructed).</ref>

The main shopping center is Wagnerplein, while there's also the Verdiplein in Stokhasselt. The one at the Tartinistraat became defunct.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2011-11-04|title=Tartinistraat Tilburg-Noord in 2013 op schop|url=http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/tartinistraat-tilburg-noord-in-2013-op-schop-1.122327|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722032918/http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/tartinistraat-tilburg-noord-in-2013-op-schop-1.122327|archive-date=22 July 2012|access-date=|website=[[Brabants Dagblad]]}}</ref> Before the district was built, it was mainly an agricultural area attached to a few villages, including Heikant, which is still the name of the biggest neighbourhood. Heikant's former village square, including the old church, is still present. The northernmost part of the district is still agricultural with some forests. In this agricultural area, the blessed [[Peter Donders]] was born; there still stands a chapel and a procession park.

=== Oost ===
[[File:Map - NL - Tilburg - Wijk 05 Oost.svg|thumb|64px|Location of Tilburg-Oost]]

=== Reeshof ===
[[File:Map - NL - Tilburg - Wijk 08 Reeshof.svg|thumb|64px|Location of the Reeshof]]

{{See also|Reeshof}}
The Reeshof is the westernmost district and the most recent expansion of the city of Tilburg proper. and has a population of 42,994 inhabitants.

The district is connected by the [[Tilburg Reeshof railway station]] and multiple roads that encircle the district plus the industrial development Vossenberg north of the Wilhelmina Canal. The [[Donge (river)|Donge]] runs through the district, including greenspace with some [[Highland cattle]] grazing between the fences protecting the surrounding neighbourhoods. This small-scale nature project is called the Dongevallei,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dongevallei.nl/ |title=Dongevallei-Site in Dutch |publisher=Dongevallei.nl |access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref> which literally means Donge Valley in English.

===Fontys School of Fine and Performing Arts===
{{See also|Fontys School of Fine and Performing Arts}}

Tilburg is also the location of the [[Fontys School of Fine and Performing Arts]] (Dutch: ''Fontys Hogeschool voor de Kunsten'' - ''FHK''), part of the [[Fontys University of Applied Sciences|Fontys Hogescholen]]. The School originated from the merging of various educational institutions that had existed in different capacity in Tilburg before being united under the Fontys group, such as the Brabants Conservatorium, one of the nine [[music schools|conservatoires]] in the Netherlands, and the Academie voor Beeldende Vorming.

Fontys School of Arts offers various [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]] and [[Master's degree|master]] programmes in English and in Dutch, across different fields in [[music]], [[visual arts]], [[dance]], [[theatre]] and [[performing arts]]

===Beverages===
[[Schrobbelèr]] is a local liqueur. It has an alcoholic percentage of 21.5%, slightly lower than most [[bitters]] and has a relatively sweet flavour. The drink is sold in a stone jar and is drunk cold from own glass, a high and tiny chalice glass, larger than a [[Jägermeister]] glass.<ref>[http://lokalespecialiteiten.nl/nl/noord-brabant/tilburg/15-schrobbeler-tilburg Schrobbelèr Tilburg] Information about Schrobbelèr</ref>
The drink originated in 1973 when Tilburgian entrepreneur Jan Wassing started experimenting with a drink with lower [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]ic percentage that was appropriate for his stomach. The result was successful. The drink is distilled now at Loven industrial area in Tilburg by the [[Eindhoven]] company Schrobbeler Ltd, without the è on the last vowel. The drink is especially consumed at [[Carnival in the Netherlands|Carnival]]. The name is derived from the profession of 'Schrobbelaar', in the textile industry in Tilburg. The profession was unskilled and had a low wage.

Another known drink from Tilburg is Peerke's Nat, which has a higher alcoholic percentage than Schrobbelèr (25%) and was introduced at the [[beatification]] of [[Peter Donders]] (locally named Peerke). The drink is sold in bottles of 70 [[liter|centiliters]].

The [[De Koningshoeven Brewery|Koningshoeven Brewery]] brews [[trappist beer]]. It was founded in 1884 at [[Koningshoeven Abbey]].

==Transport==
[[File:Tilburg Station.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Tilburg Railway Station]]
Tilburg has three railway stations: [[Tilburg railway station|Tilburg (Centraal)]], [[Tilburg Universiteit railway station|Tilburg Universiteit]] and [[Tilburg Reeshof railway station|Tilburg Reeshof]]. The latter was built to connect the then-latest district of Tilburg, the [[Reeshof]]. Intercity trains only stop at Tilburg (centraal). The name of Tilburg Universiteit Station was Tilburg West from its construction in 1968 to December 2010, however, after 40 years, it was not the westernmost station anymore. A fourth railway station is planned for [[Berkel-Enschot]], also in the municipality of Tilburg and getting more absorbed into Tilburg. In the past, until 1938, Berkel-Enschot had its own train station. [[Udenhout]], lying further northeast in the municipality, also had its train station until 1938. Both stations are on the [[Tilburg–Nijmegen railway|line to 's-Hertogenbosch]].

The Tilburg city and local buses are operated by [[Arriva]]. The city experimented from 2005 to 2008 with free public transport for children and 55+ people. Before Arriva, the buses were operated by Veolia, and before that by BBA (abbreviation for Brabants(ch)e Buurtspoorwegen en Autobussen).  The city is also served by an hourly bus service to the Belgian city of [[Turnhout]], operated by [[De Lijn]].

Tilburg has an extensive [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle path]] network called '''Sternet-Routes'''. The first bicycle path of this network was built between the city center and the [[Tilburg University|university]] in 1975. From the mid-1990s, multiple bicycle paths (rather than lanes along the road) have been built. Older lanes are paved by tiles, but newer paths are largely done with asphalt paving. For this network of bicycle paths, some new tunnels were built under the railway that crosses the city.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} Hein Eikenaar [http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/spoor-tilburg-breda-dicht-voor-aanleg-tunnelbak-1.137849 "Spoor Tilburg-Breda dicht voor aanleg tunnelbak,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121225427/http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/spoor-tilburg-breda-dicht-voor-aanleg-tunnelbak-1.137849 |date=21 January 2012 }} ''Brabants Dagblad'' (19 January 2012).

Tilburg is, at variance from other Dutch cities of a similar size, connected by only one national motorway, the [[A58 motorway (Netherlands)|A58]] / [[European route E312|E312]] (to Breda and Eindhoven). An outer beltway, consisting of two provincial 2x2-roads and the A58, was finished in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deweekkrant.nl/artikel/2012/mei/18/burgemeester_letschertweg_open |title=Burgemeester Letschertweg open &#124; Stadsnieuws &#124; dé Weekkrant |publisher=Deweekkrant.nl |access-date=24 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322105515/http://www.deweekkrant.nl/artikel/2012/mei/18/burgemeester_letschertweg_open |archive-date=22 March 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Although the outer beltway is fully navigable, the Burgemeester Bechtweg, which was built initially as a two-lane (one per direction) road, was finished in 2013. Two other routes are of considerable importance for Tilburg: the A261/N261 to [[Waalwijk]] and the A65/N65 to [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. Neither is a complete motorway, and both experience bottlenecks. Various plans exist to build both to higher standards, with the N261 improved in 2015 to remove all traffic lights beyond Tilburg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brabant.nl/dossiers/dossiers-op-thema/verkeer-en-vervoer/wegen/wegenprojecten-in-brabant/n261-grootschalige-ombouw-waalwijk-loon-op-zand.aspx |title=Grootschalige ombouw Waalwijk Loon op Zand |publisher=Brabant.nl/ |language=nl |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151048/https://www.brabant.nl/dossiers/dossiers-op-thema/verkeer-en-vervoer/wegen/wegenprojecten-in-brabant/n261-grootschalige-ombouw-waalwijk-loon-op-zand.aspx |archive-date=24 July 2011  }}</ref>
