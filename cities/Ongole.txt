== Etymology ==
Ongole's name derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word 'Ongole', meaning the 'town of [[Shiva]]'.

== History ==
The city's history dates from 230 BCE with the era of the [[Mauryas]] and [[Satavahanas]] who ruled most of what is now Andhra Pradesh. A few inscriptions dating to the Satavahana period have been found in China Ganjam, a village near Ongole.  According to the historical inscriptions available at Sri Raja Rajeswara Swami Temple complex, the city was founded by [[Cholas]]. Ongole is also mentioned in the inscriptions of the [[Pallava]] rulers of the third and fourth century A.D. The city was also ruled by [[Krishna Deva Raya]]. This place came into the limelight again during the [[Kakatiya dynasty]], when the nearby towns of [[Motupalli]] and Vodarevu served as major seaports. The last dynasty to rule the Ongole region before the British was the Mandapati dynasty ([[zamindar]]s). Kaasi Visweswara Swami temple, Chenna Kesava Swami Temple and Veeranjaneya Swami temple were built in the early 17th century by King Vankayalapati mantri and his chief of army.

Andhra Baptist Mission High School founded in the late 19th century by American Baptist missionaries, is the oldest educational institution in the city.

Ongole district came into existence on 2 February 1970, with the carving out portions of [[Markapur revenue division]] from [[Kurnool]], [[Ongole revenue division]] from [[Guntur]] and [[Kandukur revenue division]] from [[Nellore district]]s. It was renamed as [[Prakasam district]] in 1972 in memory of  freedom fighter, later Chief Minister of the composite Madras State and the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh State, [[Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu|Tanguturi Prakasam]], who was born at Vinodarayunipalem, a hamlet of Kanuparthi village of [[Naguluppalapadu mandal]] of this district.

== Geography ==
Ongole is located at 15.5°N 80.05°E. It has an average elevation of 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) [[AMSL]] and is situated on the plains. The city is around {{convert|149|km|mi}} to the south west of Amaravati, the stat capital.
