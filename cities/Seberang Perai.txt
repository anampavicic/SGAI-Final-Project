'''Seberang Perai''' is a [[List of cities in Malaysia|city]] in the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|Malaysian state]] of [[Penang]]. Located on the [[Malay Peninsula]] and separated from [[Penang Island]] by the [[Penang Strait]], it shares borders with [[Kedah]] to the north and east and [[Perak]] to the south. The city spans an area of {{Convert|748|km2|abbr=on}} and had a population of 946,092 {{As of|2020|lc=y}}, making it the [[List of cities and towns in Malaysia by population#Within defined boundaries|third largest city in Malaysia]].{{my10|2020kf}}<ref name=":32">{{Cite news |last=Edmund Lee |date=20 May 2019 |title=New era of development for Seberang Perai with ‘city status’ recognition |url=https://www.buletinmutiara.com/new-era-of-development-for-seberang-perai-with-city-status-recognition/ |access-date=5 Feb 2024 |work=Buletin Mutiara}}</ref>

Originally a part of [[Kedah Sultanate|Kedah]], the territory containing the city was ceded to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] in 1800.

== Etymology ==
Seberang Perai was originally named Province Wellesley after [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]], who was the [[Governor-General of India]] when the territory was acquired by the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] (EIC) in 1800.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cotterell |first=Arthur |title=A History of Southeast Asia |publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]] |year=2014 |isbn=9789814634700 |page=243}}</ref> The term "Seberang Perai" is believed to have emerged from a local expression used to refer to the northern banks of the [[Perai River]].<ref name=":19">{{Cite web |date=30 Sep 2016 |title=Seberang Perai: Stories from Across the Sea |url=https://mphonline.com/products/seberang-perai-stories-from-across-the-sea?srsltid=AfmBOopse_wiosU9cZekbFO6TShQ-Kx-kYZgzkrPeKxIUZHwGIlrnev5 |access-date=23 Oct 2024 |website=[[MPH Group]]}}</ref> After the acquisition of Province Wellesley, the river became the boundary between British-held territory to the south and [[Kedah Sultanate|Kedah]] to the north.

The [[Hoklo people|Hokkiens]] referred to the northern banks of the river as ''koay kang'', which means "across the river". At the time, passengers from [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] would land at [[Perai]] and cross the river to get to [[Butterworth, Seberang Perai|Butterworth]] and the hinterland beyond. The term ''koay kang'' coincides with the Malay name Seberang Perai.<ref name=":19" />

The development of roads and railways in the early 20th century promoted the growth of Province Wellesley's rubber industry.<ref name=":25" /> [[British Malaya|Malaya]]'s new rail lines, which ran from the Siamese border to the north to [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] to the south, cut through Province Wellesley, allowing the [[Port of Penang]] to become a major tin exporter. This led to the emergence of new towns, such as [[Butterworth, Seberang Perai|Butterworth]] and [[Bukit Mertajam]], as logistics hubs. The Municipal Ordinance of 1913 resulted in the creation of three local governments within Province Wellesley {{Ndash}} the Butterworth and Bukit Mertajam town boards, and the Province Wellesley Rural Board.<ref name=":22" /><ref name=":25" /> The creation of local governments further accelerated infrastructural developments within the territory.<ref name=":25" />

During the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]], Province Wellesley, like [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], underwent significant social upheaval. Civilians suffered harsh treatment from the Japanese, who attempted to enforce order, while living conditions worsened along with the economic situation.<ref name=":25" /> Rice farmers in Province Wellesley were encouraged to increase their yields, but the rice supply deficit proved too great to overcome.<ref name=":24" /> Despite the establishment of "pioneer farms" in the territory by Japanese administrators in 1944, food shortages persisted until the end of the war when [[Operation Jurist|British forces liberated Penang]]. Following the war's end, [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British authorities]] swiftly undertook action to restore order in Province Wellesley, which was plagued by elements of the [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese underworld]] and [[Malayan Communist Party|communist]] infiltrations.<ref name=":25" /><ref name=":24" />

Throughout the 19th century, Province Wellesley was administered from [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] without any local governance structure in place.<ref name=":25" /> This changed in 1913 when the Municipal Ordinance came into effect, mandating the establishment of local governments in Province Wellesley.<ref name=":22" /><ref name=":25" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=5 Jun 1913 |title=First batch of commissioners appointed: Singapore bodies to be consulted |url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitsbudget19130605-1.2.53?qt=province,%20wellesley,%20rural,%20board&q=Province%20Wellesley%20rural%20board |access-date=8 Feb 2024 |work=The Straits Budget |page=12}}</ref> Three local governments were created, namely the town boards for [[Butterworth, Seberang Perai|Butterworth]] and [[Bukit Mertajam]], and the Province Wellesley Rural Board, which administered the rest of the territory.<ref name=":22" />
