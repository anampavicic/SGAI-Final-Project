'''Norwalk''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 102,773 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]].<ref name="U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/norwalkcitycalifornia/POP010220#POP010220|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=April 25, 2022}}</ref>

Founded in the late 19th century, Norwalk was incorporated as a city in 1957. It is located {{convert|17|mi|km}} southeast of [[downtown Los Angeles]] and is part of the [[Greater Los Angeles area]].

Norwalk is a member of the [[Gateway Cities]] Council of Governments. Norwalk's sister cities are [[Morelia]] in the Mexican state of Michoacán, and [[Hermosillo]], in the Mexican state of Sonora.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.norwalk.ca.us/commissions.asp |title=City of Norwalk - Commissions |access-date=December 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503225301/http://www.ci.norwalk.ca.us/commissions.asp |archive-date=May 3, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Portrait_of_Don_Juan_Temple,_an_early_owner_of_the_Ranch_Los_Cerritos_in_Long_Beach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Much of modern-day Norwalk was part of [[Rancho Los Cerritos]], owned by Don [[Juan Temple]].]]

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Norwalk1957.jpg|thumb|Norwalk in 1957]] -->

The area known as "Norwalk" was first home to the [[Shoshonean]] Native American tribe. They survived primarily on [[honey]], an array of berries, acorns, sage, squirrels, rabbits and birds. Their huts were part of the Sejat Indian village.<ref>[https://www.norwalk.org/about-us/general-info-statistics General Info & Statistics | City of Norwalk, CA]</ref>

In the late 1760s, settlers and missions flourished under Spanish rule with the famous [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] trail traversing the area. [[Rancho Los Nietos|Manuel Nieto]], a Spanish soldier, received a [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant ([[Rancho Los Nietos]]) in 1784 that included Norwalk.

After the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1848, the Rancho and mining days ended. Portions of the land were subdivided and made available for sale when [[California]] was admitted into the union of the United States. Word of this land development reached the Sproul Brothers in Oregon. They recalled the fertile land and huge sycamore trees they saw during an earlier visit to the Southern California area. In 1869, Atwood Sproul, on behalf of his brother, Gilbert, purchased {{convert|463|acre|km2}} of land at $11 an acre ($2,700/km<sup>2</sup>) in an area known as ''Corazón de los Valles'', or "Heart of the Valleys".<ref>Long Beach Press-Telegram, December 23, 1923, Page 44</ref>

By 1873, railroads were being built in the area and the Sprouls deeded {{Convert|23|acre|m2}}, stipulating a "passenger stop" clause in the deed. Three days after the Anaheim Branch Railroad crossed the "North-walk" for the first time, Gilbert Sproul surveyed a town site. In 1874, the name was recorded officially as Norwalk. While a majority of the Norwalk countryside remained undeveloped during the 1880s, the Norwalk Station allowed potential residents the opportunity to visit the "country" from across the nation.<ref>McGroarty, J. S. (1923). History of Los Angeles County. United States: American Historical Society, Incorporated. p.544 “ in the winter of 1868 he and his brother Gilbert H. bought 457 acres of unimproved land at what is now Norwalk, the original portion of the Sproul ranch costing only eleven dollars an acre. The village of Norwalk stands on this ranch. Immediately after locating on the property, Atwood Sproul built a livery barn and began buying, selling and training horses. A number of splendid horses were kept there. One of them was Conveth, a chestnut horse that sold for $ 10,000 as a yearling . The Sproul Brothers gave the right of way and depot grounds, altogether twenty-three acres, to the railroad . In the deed conveying this property was a clause compelling maintenance of daily train service for the station at Norwalk. This clause proved very valuable to the citizens of the community. At one time the railroad declined to stop for passengers. "</ref>

The families referred to as the "first families" of Norwalk (including the Sprouls, the Dewitts, the Settles, and the Orrs) settled in the area in the years before 1900. D.D. Johnston pioneered the first school system in Norwalk in 1880. Johnston was also responsible for the first real industry in town, a cheese factory, by furnishing Tom Lumbard with the money in 1882. Norwalk's prosperity was evident in the 1890s with the construction of a number of fine homes that were located in the middle of orchards, farms and dairies. Headstones for these families can be found at Little Lake Cemetery, which was founded in 1843 on the border between Norwalk and [[Santa Fe Springs]] at Lakeland Road.

At the turn of the 19th century, Norwalk had become established as a dairy center. Of the 50 local families reported in the 1900 census, most were associated with farming or with the dairy industry. Norwalk was also the home of some of the largest sugar beet farms in all of Southern California during this era. Many of the dairy farmers who settled in Norwalk during the early part of the 20th century were Dutch.

After the 1950s, the Hispanic population in Norwalk grew significantly as the area became increasingly residential.

===Airplane disaster===
In February 1958, two military aircraft, a Douglas [[C-118]]A military transport and a U.S. Navy [[P-2 Neptune|P2V]]-5F Neptune patrol bomber, collided over Norwalk at night. Forty-seven servicemen were killed, as was a civilian 23-year-old woman on the ground who was hit by falling debris. A plaque commemorating the disaster and erected by the American Legion in 1961 marks the spot of the accident, today a mini-mall at the corner of Firestone Boulevard and Pioneer Boulevard.

===The Hargitt House===
Built in 1891 by the D.D. Johnston family, the [[Darius David Johnston House|Hargitt House]] was built in the architectural style of [[Eastlake movement|Victorian Eastlake]]. The Hargitt House Museum, located at 12426 Mapledale, was donated to the people of Norwalk by Charles ("Chun") and Ida Hargitt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parks & Recreation: Historic Norwalk|url=http://www.ci.norwalk.ca.us/city-hall/departments/recreation-park-services/historic-norwalk|publisher=City of Norwalk|access-date=January 12, 2016}}</ref>

The house was moved in 1962 to its current location on Sproul Street and was opened to tourists in 1964. 'Most of the items we collected from residents when we opened in 1962' Mrs Robinson said 'All of the guns are from the Sproul family '. Vida Sproul Hunter was the last Sproul to live in the house After that the house was rented for a while and then donated to the city. During one year 28000 people toured the house. They’ve come from all over the area to see it.

Founded in 1955, Cerritos College is a public community college serving an area of {{convert|52|sqmi|km2}} of southeastern Los Angeles county. The college offers degrees and certificates in 87 areas of study in nine divisions. Over 1,200 students complete their course of studies each year.[[File:1890 Norwalk Grammar School.jpg|thumb|right|Norwalk Grammar School class in 1890. Cora Hargitt Middle School Academy (operated 1980–2008) was named after the teacher, at top left.]]Most of Norwalk is served by the [[Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District]],<ref name=LACountycensusSDmap2020>{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st06_ca/schooldistrict_maps/c06037_los_angeles/DC20SD_C06037.pdf|title=2020 CENSUS - SCHOOL DISTRICT REFERENCE MAP: Los Angeles County, CA|publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]]|page=10 (PDF p. 11/19)|access-date=November 23, 2023}}</ref>
