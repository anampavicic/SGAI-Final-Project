'''Suzhou''', ({{zh|s=宿州|p=Sùzhōu}}) formerly romanized as Suchow,<ref>[[Postal romanisation]].</ref> is a [[prefecture-level city]] in northern [[Anhui|Anhui, China]]. The city straddles the {{Interlanguage link|Tuohe|lt=Tuohe|zh|沱河}} and {{Interlanguage link|Xinbian|lt=Xinbian|zh|新汴河}} rivers, which fork at its western end. The Tuohe was formerly a left [[tributary]] of the [[Huai River]], while the latter is a modern artificial canal, but now both drain into [[Hongze Lake]]. It borders the prefectural cities of [[Huaibei]] and [[Bengbu]] to the southwest and south respectively, and the provinces of [[Jiangsu]] to the east, [[Shandong]] to the north, and [[Henan]] to the northwest.

Its population was 5,324,476 inhabitants at the 2020 census, of whom 1,766,285 lived in the [[Urban area|built-up area]] (or [[Metropolitan area|metro]]) of [[Yongqiao District]], even though that district remains largely rural.

==History==
'''Suzhou''' was formerly '''Su County''' ({{zh|s=宿县|t=宿縣|p=Sù Xiàn|links=no}}).

==Administration==
Suzhou administers five [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including one [[District of China|district]] and four [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]].
