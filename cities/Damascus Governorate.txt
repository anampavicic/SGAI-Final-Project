'''Damascus Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|مُحافظة دمشق}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Muḥāfaẓat Dimashq}}'') is one of the fourteen [[Governorates of Syria|governorates]] (provinces) of [[Syria]]. Completely surrounded by the [[Rif Dimashq Governorate]], it consists only of the city of [[Damascus]], the capital of Syria.

The governorate's area is around 107 km2, encompassing the area of the city of Damascus, while the population is around 2,503,000.

== Geography ==
Damascus occupies a strategic location on a plateau which rises 680&nbsp;m (2,230&nbsp;ft) above sea level and about 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi) inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon mountains, supplied with water by the Barada River. The Anti-Lebanon mountains which mark the border between Syria and Lebanon, block precipitation from the Mediterranean sea, so that the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times this was mitigated by the Barada River, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the [[Ghouta]], an irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals, and fruits have been farmed since ancient times.

The governorate occupies an area of 107&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 79&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which is urban while the rest is occupied by [[Mount Qasioun]] which overlooks the city.
