'''Rosetta''' ({{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|ˈ|z|ɛ|t|ə}} {{respell|roh|ZET|ə}}){{efn|{{langx|fr|Rosette}}, {{IPA|fr|ʁozɛt|IPA}}.}} or '''Rashid''' ({{langx|ar|رشيد|Rašīd}}, {{IPA|arz|ɾɑˈʃiːd|IPA}}; {{langx|cop|ϯⲣⲁϣⲓⲧ|ti-Rashit}}){{efn|{{langx|grc|Βολβιτίνη|Bolbitínē}}.<ref>James Talboys Wheeler, ''The geography of Herodotus'', 1854, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QnICAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA363 p. 363]</ref>}} is a [[port]] city of the [[Nile Delta]], {{convert|65|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Alexandria]], in [[Egypt]]'s [[Beheira Governorate|Beheira governorate]]. The [[Rosetta Stone]] was discovered there in 1799.

Founded around the 9th century on the site of the ancient town of '''Bolbitine''', Rosetta boomed with the decline of Alexandria following the [[Ottoman conquest of Egypt]] in 1517, only to wane in importance after Alexandria's revival. During the 19th century, it was a popular [[United Kingdom|British]] tourist destination, known for its Ottoman mansions, citrus groves and relative cleanliness.

==Etymology==
The name of the town most likely comes from an Arabic name ''[[Rashid (name)|Rašīd]]'' (meaning "guide")<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Peust|first=Carsten|title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypte|year=2010|location=Göttingen|pages=75}}</ref> and was transcribed and corrupted in numerous ways – the name ''Rexi'' was used by the Crusaders in Middle Ages<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Forster|first=E. M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IROKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT133|title=Alexandria: A History and a Guide|year=2021|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}</ref> and ''Rosetta'' or ''Rosette'' ("little rose" in Italian and French respectively) was used by the French at the time of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s campaign [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|in Egypt]]. The latter lent its name to the [[Rosetta Stone]] ({{langx|fr|Pierre de Rosette}}), which was found by French soldiers at the nearby [[Fort Julien]] in 1799.

Some scholars believe that there is no evidence that the city's name comes from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], and the Coptic form {{lang|cop|ϯⲣⲁϣⲓⲧ}} is just a late transcription of the Arabic name.<ref name=":0" /> Some argue that it could be derived from {{Langx|egy|rꜣ-šdı͗|lit=dug up mouth (of the Nile)}} and that the name is ancient.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Engsheden |first=Âke |title=Ancient Place-Names in the Governorate of Kafr el-Sheikh |date=15 August 2023 |publisher=Peeters |isbn=9789042941755 |location=Leuven |pages=16}}</ref>

==History==
In [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] Bolbitine was celebrated for its manufactory of [[Chariot|chariots]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854), BOLBIT´INE |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=bolbitine-geo |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>

Iban Haqal mentioned it and said that it is a city on the Nile, close to the salt sea from a crater known as Ashtum ({{Langx|grc|Στόμα}} "mouth, estuary").<ref name=":0" /> Also mentioned in the Al-Mushtaq excursion, it was described as a civilized city with a market, merchants and workers, and it has farms, yields, wheat and barley, and it has many good words, and it has many palm trees and wet fruits, and it has whales and fish species from the salty sea and many indigo fish.

Despite the similarity of Rashid and [[Damietta]] in their geographical and administrative position throughout the ages and as an important coastal city, Rashid did not play a clear, influential role compared to Damietta's role in the beginnings of Arab Islamic rule, especially for Rashid's proximity to the location of Alexandria, which is the first coastal city in Egypt and primarily affected Rashid and its position. Likewise, the agricultural area in Rashid is very limited, and the spread of sand formations to the west of the city and its urbanization has a greater impact on the city and its agriculture; As a result, Rashid was deserted several times by its residents and they took refuge in [[Fuwwah]], in the south.<ref>محمد طاهر الصادق ومحمد حسام إسماعيل، مرجع سابق، صـ: 39.</ref>

What is now known today as Rosetta was an [[Umayyad]] stronghold in 749, when it was sacked during the [[Bashmuric Revolt]].<ref>{{citation |author=Mounir Megally |title=Bashmuric Revolts |editor-link=Aziz Suryal Atiya |editor=Aziz Suryal Atiya |encyclopedia=[[The Coptic Encyclopedia]] |publisher=Macmillan Publishers |location=New York |year=1991 |at=cols. 349b–351b |volume=2 |url=http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/cce/id/326}}.</ref> In the 850s, the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Al-Mutawakkil]] ordered a fort to be built on the site of the Ptolemaic city of [[Bolbitine]], and the medieval city grew around this fort.<ref name=":1" /> 

Following the establishment of the Fatimid state in 969, and the establishment of the city of Cairo as the new capital of the country, foreign trade was active that was no longer limited to Alexandria only. Rather, Rashid and Damietta participated in it, especially in the beginnings of the Fatimid state, which made urbanism restart.<ref>شهاب الدين أبي عبد الله ياقوت بن عبد الله الحموي، معجم البلدان: الجزء الثالث، دار الفكر، بيروت، صـ: 45.</ref>

In the era of the Ayyubid state, neighboring Alexandria witnessed extensive commercial activity as a result of the concessions granted by the Ayyubids to Italian merchants, and before the Bay of Alexandria was re-cleared in 1013 in the Fatimid era by order of [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], which contributed to linking Alexandria to the city of [[Fuwwah]], south of Rashid and overlooking the Nile. And from it to Cairo and the rest of the cities of Egypt, and this led to the flourishing of the commercial activity of [[Fuwwah]], which affected the movement of trade Rashid, so that in the era of the Mamluks Fuwwah became the base of the trade networks in the region.<ref>سعيد عبد الفناح عاشور، مصر في العصور الوسطى، ـــــ، القاهرة، 1970، صـ: 404.</ref>

During the [[Seventh Crusade]], [[Louis IX of France]] briefly occupied the town in 1249.<ref>Peter Jackson, ''The Seventh Crusade, 1244–1254: Sources and Documents'', Volume 16 of Crusade Texts in Translation, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gut0pQ6Znc0C&pg=PA72 p. 72]</ref> Following the destruction of Damietta during the crusade, [[Al-Zahir Baybars]] built it again in 1250. However, due to the huge costs of protecting it with strong walls and an impenetrable castle, he built a fortress in 1262 to monitor any possible upcoming invasion. During the reign of [[Al-Nasir Muhammad]], the Gulf of Alexandria was re-excavated, so the commercial movement flourished more in Alexandria and was uttered so much that it became the mouth of Egypt's most important commercial city after Cairo. This had a more negative impact on Rashid, to the point that [[Abu al-Fidaa]] noted in the thirteenth century that the city was smaller than his mouth.<ref>نقولا يوسف، دمياط منذ أقدم العصور، الاتحاد القومي بدمياط، دمياط، 1959، صـ: 159</ref>

Rashid contributed to the launching of the naval campaigns during Sultan [[Barbsay]] reign to invade the island of [[Cyprus]] and bring it under Egyptian control in 1426. Rashid also suffered from the attacks of the Christian knights who lived on the island of [[Rhodes]] during the reign of the sultan [[Sayf ad-Din Jaqmaq]]. Sultan Jaqamq sent a large garrison to protect Rashid's beach. and ordered its reinforcement in the following years. Then the throne came to [[Qaitbay]] and renewed the Rashid Towers in 1479 and renewed the castle, which was named after him so far, and built a wall to protect the city from raids. Generally, Rashid had a defensive role with a little commercial role.<ref>جمال الدين أبي المحاسن يوسف بن تغري بردي الأتابكي، النجوم الزاهرة في ملوك مصر والقاهرة: الجزء 15، الهيئة العامة لقصور الثقافة، القاهرة، صـ: 334.</ref>

Under the [[Mamelukes]], the city became an important commercial center, and remained so throughout [[Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman rule]], until the eventual resurgence of the importance of [[Alexandria]] following the construction of the [[Mahmoudiyah canal]] in 1820.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
Rosetta witnessed the defeat of the British [[Fraser campaign]], on 19 September 1807.

==Geography==
The city is located 65 km (40 mi) east of Alexandria, in Egypt's Beheira governorate.
===Climate===
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh), but blowing winds from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] greatly moderate the temperatures, typical to the [[northern coast of Egypt|Egypt's north coast]], making its summers moderately hot and humid, with winters that are mild and moderately [[precipitation (meteorology)|wet]] when [[Ice pellets|sleet]] and [[hail]] are also common.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
