== History ==
The area of Takatsuki was part of northern [[Settsu Province]] and has been continuously settled since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period. Remains from the [[Yayoi period]] and [[Kofun period]] are plentiful, including the [[Imashirozuka Kofun]] and the Mishima Kofun cluster. The place name 'Takatsuki' first appeared in historical materials around the 14th century, during the [[Kamakura period]], in a list of manors belonging to [[Kasuga Shrine]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. During the [[Muromachi period]], the area was a stronghold of the [[Ikkō-ikki]] movement, and in the [[Sengoku period]] was under the control of the warlords [[Miyoshi Nagayoshi]] and [[Takayama Ukon]]. During the [[Edo Period]], [[Takatsuki Domain]] changed hands between several ''[[fudai daimyō]]'' clans and a ''[[jōkamachi]]'' developed around [[Takatsuki Castle]]. Takatsuki Village was established within Shimakami District, Osaka with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, and elevated to town status on October 14,  1898.  Takatsuki grew by annexing neighboring villages in the 1930s, and was elevated to city status on January 1, 1943. Takatsuki annexed the village of Abuno in 1448, Goryo in 1950, Sankamaki in 1955, Tomita in 1956 and the village of Kashida from Minamikuwata District, Kyoto in 1958. On April 1, 2003, Takatsuki was designated a  [[Core cities of Japan|Core city]] with increased local autonomy.
