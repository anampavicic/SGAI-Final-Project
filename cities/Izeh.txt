Izeh has mines of rocks and minerals. It is famous for its dam and ancient monuments that are located in [[Kul-e Farah]], [[Eshkaft-e Salman]], Khongazhdar, [[Tagh e Tavileh]], [[Shir-e Sangi]] (Stone Lion cemetery), [[Shahsavar, Khuzestan|Shahsavar]] relief, Khong e Kamalvand, Khong e Ajdar, Khong e Yaralivand, ghalesard village (Qalesard), and [[Sheyvand]] relief.

== History ==
From the works found in Izeh, including Elamite paintings and reliefs (the first sculptures of ancient Iran before the Achaemenid period), it can be concluded that it was an important center during the Elamite period. These works are divided into two categories of old and new works of Elam, which are as follows: Old Elam period: This period belongs to the Anzan dynasty, which was destroyed several times by the ruler of Ur. [14] The remaining works from this period are as follows. :

Shaheswar relief: Shaheswar is an ancient place in the outskirts of Izeh, where there are ancient works, including a relief belonging to the old Elam period (20th century BC). This relief most likely represents a public scene of a king or an expression of servitude before a god.
The relief of Khong Azdar: This place is also known as Khong Nowrozi and it is located near Miangaran Lake (12 km north of Izeh) whose reliefs are carved like Shaheswar.
Period of New Elam: Izeh was called "Ayapir" in the period of New Elam [source needed] and its kings ruled independently under Sukhalmahu, the prime minister of Elam. The government of Elam in this era was in the form of a union and was administered by a number of independent local governments.[15]

The works of this course are:

Kul Farah (Kul Farah): Kul Farah is a valley-like survey in the mountains around the plain, located 7 km northeast of Izeh, which was used as an open prayer place in the era of New Elam. In this gap, 6 reliefs along with Elamite (cuneiform) writings provide valuable historical information. Most of these reliefs commemorate the religious ceremonies or feasts of Hani Shah, the son of Tahi Hei (Takhi Hei), the puppet ruler of Ayapir by Shutruk Nahunte. Among the interesting points of these reliefs, we can mention the religious customs of Elam, where priests are sacrificing animals and musicians are playing music, and people or elders are in a special state (perhaps a state of trance) in praying and carrying the gods. [16]
Shaheswar relief: It is one of the oldest reliefs from the Elam period, which is carved at the end of the road leading to the village of Kohbad Ik in the heart of the mountain. Shaheswar cemetery, one of the ancient cemeteries covered with stone lions of Bakhtiari region, is located in this village.
Ashkeft Salman: It is a gorge in Mount Elhak located in the southwest of Izeh. In this gorge, there are four reliefs, all of which belong to Hani, which mostly refers to the royal family and gods. In this ancient place, there was once a "Tarisha" prayer house.
According to some historical narratives, after entering Iran and stopping in Hamedan, Alexander was deeply disturbed by the death of his young general Hephaestion and ordered to trim the manes of the horses and mules and erect the congresses of the towers and ramparts. Then the unseen Wei Wei called Hephaestion a demigod on behalf of Jupiter and demanded a sacrifice for his forgiveness. Finally, in order to find solace in the war, Alexander went to the land of the Kusians and after subduing them, he organized a manhunt and ordered to kill everyone, leaving no difference between men and women, big and small, and called this terrible butchery the burial sacrifice of Hephaestion. This incident happened in Bakhtiari mountains in Izeh.[17]

From this era and then from the Party era, several statues and some reliefs and... have remained. From this time on, Izeh was run independently and was called Elimayd. The works of this course are:

Khong Yar Alivand: In this ancient site, which is located 3 km from Khong Ajdar, there is a relief including two people from Elimai in a ritual ceremony.
Khong Kamal Vand: This ancient site is located 4 kilometers north of Khong Yar Ali Vand and has a relief along with an Elimian inscription.
Khong Ajdar: [18] (142 BC) right behind the stone slab where the relief of old Elam was, there is a relief belonging to the Parthian period, which is Mehrdad I (source: matching the image of Shah Drangarkand Khong Ajdar with the image of Mehrdad I Parthian coin) It shows the Parthian king with Elymai high-ranking people.
Kazhdemak Castle: In the heights of Khong Atzdar, there is a castle made of stone, clay, and clay with crescent and stone arches, which is known as "Kazhdemak Castle" in this area. This castle was probably abandoned during the time of Ardeshir Sassanid.
[19] And for the first time they were the ones who called Izeh Malmir or Mal Amir (Malek Amir): [20]

"We left from Tester (Sushtar). We walked through the high mountains for three days until we reached the city of Izeh, Izeh is also called the Mall of the Amir.

The works of Atabakan Ler period is a stone structure that was exposed in Ashkeft Salman after excavation. After the fall of the Atabakan government in 857 AH. Qaizeh began to fall into disrepair and its inhabitants turned to wandering. [22] Also, the works of the Ilkhanid and Mughal eras from the ancient site called Atabki Taq Tavaleh citadel in the form of stone-plaster construction with plastering and tiling works are available in the current city of Izeh. has come From the Safavid period, there is a cemetery with stone lions in Shaheswar, which of course were used until the Qajar period.
