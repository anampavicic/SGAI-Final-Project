By 1258, a [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]-fortified [[Bayan (settlement)|polity]] called [[Maynila (historical polity)|Maynila]] existed on the site of modern Manila. On June 24, 1571, after the defeat of the polity's last indigenous ruler, [[Rajah Sulayman]], in the [[Battle of Bangkusay]], Spanish ''[[conquistador]]'' [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] began constructing the walled fortification of [[Intramuros]] on the ruins of an older settlement from whose name the Spanish and English name ''Manila'' derives. Manila was used as the capital of the captaincy general of the [[Spanish East Indies]], which included the [[Marianas]], [[Guam]], and other islands, and was controlled and administered for the Spanish crown by [[Mexico City]] in the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]].

In modern times, the name "Manila" is commonly used to refer to the entire metropolitan area, the [[Mega Manila|greater metropolitan area]], and the [[city proper]]. [[Metro Manila]], the officially defined metropolitan area, is the [[capital region]] of the Philippines, and includes the much larger [[Quezon City]] and the [[Makati Central Business District]]. It is the most populous region in the country, one of the most populous urban areas in the world,<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 19, 2016 |title=Highlights of the Philippine Population 2015 Census of Population |url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/highlights-philippine-population-2015-census-population |access-date=April 12, 2017 |website=Philippine Statistics Authority}}</ref> and one of the wealthiest regions in [[Southeast Asia]].

The [[Pasig River]] flows through the middle of Manila, dividing it into northern and southern sections. The city comprises [[#Barangays and districts|16 administrative districts]] and is divided into [[Legislative districts of Manila|six political districts]] for the purposes of representation in the [[Congress of the Philippines]] and the election of city council members.

==Etymology ==
{{see also|Nicknames of Manila}}
''Maynilà'', the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] name for the city, comes from the phrase ''may-nilà'', meaning "where indigo is found".<ref name="baumgartner">{{Cite journal |last=Baumgartner |first=Joseph |date=March 1975 |title=Manila – Maynilad or Maynila? |journal=Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=52–54 |jstor=29791188}}</ref> ''Nilà'' is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''nīla'' ({{lang|sa|[[wiktionary:नील#Sanskrit|नील]]}}), which refers to [[indigo dye]] and, by extension, to [[Indigofera|several plant species]] from which this natural dye can be extracted.<ref name=baumgartner/><ref name="chamberlain">{{Cite journal |last=Chamberlain |first=Alexander F. |date=1901 |title=Philippine Studies: V.

===May-nilad===
[[File:Scyphiphora_hydrophylacea_Blanco2.277.png|120px|thumb|left|Plate depicting the "nilad" plant (''[[Scyphiphora hydrophylacea]]''), from Augustinian missionary Fray [[Francisco Manuel Blanco]]'s botanical reference, ''Flora de Filipinas'']]

According to an antiquated, inaccurate, and now debunked etymological theory, the city's name originated from the word ''may-nilad'' (meaning "where ''nilad'' is found").<ref name=baumgartner/> There are two versions of this false etymology. One popular incorrect notion is that the old word ''nilad'' refers to the [[water hyacinth]] (''Eichhornia crassipes'') that grows on the banks of the [[Pasig River]].<ref name=baumgartner/> This plant species, however, was only recently introduced into the Philippines from South America and therefore could not be the source of the toponym for old Manila.<ref name=baumgartner/>

Another incorrect etymology arose from the observation that, in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], ''nilád'' or ''nilár'' refers to a shrub-like tree (''[[Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea]]''; formerly ''Ixora manila'' Blanco) that grows in or near [[mangrove]] swamps.<ref name=baumgartner/><ref>{{Cite web |title=''Ixora manila'' Blanco |url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=235302 |access-date=August 20, 2018 |website=World Marine Species Database}}</ref><ref name="merrill">{{Cite book |last=Merrill |first=Elmer Drew |url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofplan00merr#page/88/search/nilar |title=A Dictionary of the Plant Names of the Philippine Islands |date=1903 |publisher=Bureau of Public Printing |location=Manila |authorlink=Elmer Drew Merrill}}</ref> Linguistic analysis, however, shows the word ''Maynilà'' is unlikely to have developed from this term. It is unlikely native Tagalog speakers would completely drop the final consonant /d/ in ''nilad'' to arrive at the present form ''Maynilà''.<ref name=baumgartner/> As an example, nearby [[Bacoor]] retains the final consonant of the old Tagalog word ''bakoód'' ("elevated piece of land"), even in old Spanish renderings of the placename (e.g., ''Vacol'', ''Bacor'').<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aloma Monte de los Santos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hibkAAAAMAAJ |title=Parish of Santo Niño de Molino – Bacoor, Cavite – 1984–1994: The Making of a Parish |date=1994 |publisher=Parish of Santo Niño de Molino |access-date=August 20, 2018}}</ref> Historians [[Ambeth Ocampo]]<ref name="ambeth" /><ref name="lookingback">{{Cite book |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCZyAAAAMAAJ |title=Looking Back, Volume 1 |date=1990 |publisher=Anvil Publishing Inc. |isbn=9789712700583 |access-date=August 21, 2018}}</ref> and [[Joseph Baumgartner]]<ref name=baumgartner/> have shown, in every early document, that the place name Maynilà was always written without a final /d/. This documentation shows that the ''may-nilad'' etymology is spurious.

Originally, the mistaken identification of ''nilad'' as the source of the toponym probably originated in an 1887 essay by [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]], in which he mistakenly used the word ''nila'' to refer both to ''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]'' (true indigo) and to ''[[Scyphiphora|Ixora manila]]'', which is actually ''nilád'' in Tagalog.<ref name=merrill/>).<ref name=chamberlain/><ref name=baumgartner/> Early 20th century writings, such as those of [[Julio Nakpil]],<ref>Nakpil, Julio.

The earliest evidence of human life around present-day Manila is the nearby [[Angono Petroglyphs]], which are dated to around 3000 BC. [[Negritos]], the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines, lived across the island of [[Luzon]], where Manila is located, before [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesians]] arrived and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] them.<ref>Mijares, Armand Salvador B.

Manila was an active trade partner with the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan dynasties]] of China.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Junker |first=Laura Lee |title=Raiding, Trading, and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-9715503471 |location=Quezon City |pages=184–192}}</ref>

The polity of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] flourished during the latter half of the [[Ming dynasty]] as a result of direct trade relations with China. Tondo district was the traditional capital of the empire and its rulers were sovereign kings rather than chieftains. Tondo was named using [[traditional Chinese characters]] in the [[Hokkien in the Philippines|Hokkien]] reading, {{zh|t=|poj=Tong-to͘|l=Eastern Capital|c=東都|s=|p=}}, due to its chief position southeast of China. The kings of Tondo were addressed as ''panginoón'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ("lords"); ''anák banwa'' ("son of heaven"); or ''[[lakandula]]'' ("lord of the palace"). The [[Emperor of China]] considered the [[lakan]]s—the rulers of ancient Manila—"王" (kings).<ref>Wakan Sansai Zue, Pages 202-216</ref>
 
During the 12th century, then-Hindu Brunei called "Pon-i", as reported in the Chinese annals ''Nanhai zhi'', invaded Malilu 麻裏蘆 (present-day Manila) as it also administered [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]], as well as the Philippine kingdoms of: [[Rajahnate of Butuan|Butuan]], [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]], [[Ma-i]] (Mindoro), [[Sanmalan|Shahuchong]] 沙胡重 (present-day [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]]), Yachen 啞陳 ([[Oton]]), and 文杜陵 Wenduling (present-day [[Mindanao]]). Manila regained independence.<ref>[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228735802.pdf Reading Song-Ming Records on the Pre-colonial History of the Philippines] By Wang Zhenping Page 256.</ref> In the 13th century, Manila consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter on the shore of the Pasig River. It was then conquered by the [[Greater India|Indianized]] empire of [[Majapahit]], according to the epic eulogy poem ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', which described the area's conquest by [[Maharaja]] [[Hayam Wuruk]]. Selurong (षेलुरोङ्), a historical name for Manila, is listed in Canto 14 alongside Sulot – which is now [[Sulu]] – and [[Kalka]]. Selurong, together with Sulot, was able to regain independence afterward, and Sulu attacked and looted the then-Majapahit-invaded province [[Sultanate of Brunei|Po-ni]] (Brunei) in retribution.<ref>Brunei Rediscovered: A Survey of Early Times By Robert Nicholl Page 12, citing: "Groenveldt, Notes Page 112"</ref>

During the reign of the Arab emir, [[Bolkiah|Sultan Bolkiah]] – [[Sharif Ali]]'s descendant – from 1485 to 1521, the [[Bruneian Empire|Sultanate of Brunei]] which had seceded from Hindu [[Majapahit]] and converted to Islam, had invaded the area. The Bruneians wanted to take advantage of Tondo's strategic position in direct trade with China and subsequently attacked the region and established the rajahnate of [[Maynila (historical polity)|Maynilà]] (كوتا سلودوڠ; ''Kota Seludong''). The rajahnate was ruled under Brunei and gave yearly tribute as a [[satellite state]].<ref name="Pusat Sejarah Brunei2">{{Cite web |title=Pusat Sejarah Brunei |url=http://www.history-centre.gov.bn/sultanbrunei.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415152209/http://www.history-centre.gov.bn/sultanbrunei.htm |archive-date=April 15, 2015 |access-date=March 3, 2014 |publisher=Government of Brunei Darussalam |language=ms}}</ref> It created a new dynasty under the local leader, who accepted Islam and became [[Rajah Sulaiman I|Rajah Salalila or Sulaiman I]].

[[File:Gerald R Mondala Ayuntamiento de Manila (Casas Consistoriales).jpg|thumb|left|[[Ayuntamiento de Manila]] served as the City Hall during the Spanish Colonial Period.]]

On June 24, 1571, [[conquistador]] [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] arrived in Manila and declared it a territory of [[New Spain]] (Mexico), establishing a city council in what is now [[Intramuros]] district. Inspired by the ''[[Reconquista]]'', a war in mainland Spain to re-Christianize and reclaim parts of the country that had been ruled by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], he took advantage of a territorial conflict between Hindu Tondo and Islamic Manila to justify expelling or converting Bruneian Muslim colonists who supported their Manila vassals while his Mexican grandson [[Juan de Salcedo]] had a romantic relationship with [[Princess Kandarapa|Kandarapa]], a princess of Tondo.<ref>Wright, Hamilton M.

The victorious Spaniards made Manila the capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]] and of the Philippines, which their empire would control for the next three centuries. In 1574, Manila was besieged by the Chinese pirate [[Lim Hong]], who was thwarted by local inhabitants. Upon Spanish settlement, Manila was immediately made, by papal decree, [[Archdiocese of Manila|a suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Mexico]]. By royal decree of [[Philip II of Spain]], Manila was put under the spiritual patronage of Saint [[Pudentiana]] and [[Our Lady of Guidance]].{{efn|This was spurred by a locally found sacred image, i.e., a [[Black Madonna]] of unknown origin; one theory is that it is from Portuguese-Macau, another is that it is a Tantric goddess and this was worshiped by the natives in a Pagan-Hindu manner and had survived Islamic iconoclasm by the Sultanate of Brunei. This image was interpreted to be of Marian nature, and it was found during the Miguel de Legazpi expedition and eventually, a Mexican hermit built a chapel around that image.}}

Manila became famous for its role in the [[Manila galleon|Manila–Acapulco galleon]] trade, which lasted for more than two centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa, and Hispanic America across the [[Pacific Islands]] to Southeast Asia, and ''vice versa''. [[Silver]] that was mined in Mexico and Peru was exchanged for Chinese silk, Indian gems, and spices from Indonesia and Malaysia.

Meanwhile, in the Spanish garrisons, Spanish was used among administrators and priests. Nonetheless, there is not enough historical information on the social role of these men. In fact some of the few references point to a quick integration into the local society: "los hombres del pueblo, los soldados y marinos, anónimos, olvidados, absorbidos en su totalidad por la población Filipina." (Bernal 1964: 188). In addition to the Manila-Acapulco galleon, a complex commercial maritime system circulated European and Asian commodities including slaves. During the 17th century, Portuguese vessels traded with the ports of Manila and Cavite, even after the prohibition of 1644 (Seijas 2008: 21). Crucially, the commercial activities included the smuggling and trade of slaves: "from the Moluccas, and Malacca, and India... with the monsoon winds" carrying "clove spice, cinnamon, and pepper and black slaves, and Kafir [slaves]" (Antonio de Morga cf Seijas 2008: 21)." Though there is no data on the numbers of slaves in Cavite, the numbers in Manila suggest a significant fraction of the population had been brought in as slaves by the Portuguese vessels. By 1621, slaves in Manila numbered 1,970 out of a population of 6,110. This influx of slaves continued until late in the 17th century; according to contemporary cargo records in 1690, 200 slaves departed from Malacca to Manila (Seijas 2008: 21). Different ethnicities were favored for different labor; Africans were brought to work on the agricultural production, and skilled slaves from India served as caulkers and carpenters.

{{blockquote|The diversity here is immense such that I could go on forever trying to differentiate lands and peoples. There are Castilians from all provinces. There are Portuguese and Italians; Dutch, Greeks and Canary Islanders, and Mexican Indians. There are slaves from Africa brought by the Spaniards [Through America], and others brought by the Portuguese [Through India]. There is an African Moor with his turban here. There are Javanese from Java, Japanese and Bengalese from Bengal. Among all these people are the Chinese whose numbers here are untold and who outnumber everyone else. From China there are peoples so different from each other, and from provinces as distant, as Italy is from Spain. Finally, of the ''mestizos'', the mixed-race people here, I cannot even write because in Manila there is no limit to combinations of peoples with peoples. This is in the city where all the buzz is.

Instability continued the following year, with the most significant incident being the August 1971 [[Plaza Miranda bombing]] caused nine deaths and injured 95 others, including many prominent Liberal Party politicians including incumbent Senators [[Jovito Salonga]], [[Eddie Ilarde]], [[Eva Estrada-Kalaw]], and Liberal Party president [[Gerardo Roxas]], [[Sergio Osmeña Jr.]], Manila 2nd District Councilor Ambrosio "King" Lorenzo Jr., and Congressman [[Ramon Bagatsing]] who was the party's mayoral candidate for Manila.<ref name="Daroy1988"/>

Marcos reacted to the bombing by blaming the still nascent [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and then suspending of the writ of Habeas Corpus. The suspension is noted for forcing many members of the moderate opposition, including figures like [[Edgar Jopson]], to join the ranks of the radicals. In the aftermath of the bombing, Marcos lumped all of the opposition together and referred to them as communists, and many former moderates fled to the mountain encampments of the radical opposition to avoid being arrested by Marcos' forces.  Those who became disenchanted with the excesses of the Marcos administration and wanted to join the opposition after 1971 often joined the ranks of the radicals, simply because they represented the only group vocally offering opposition to the Marcos government.<ref name="OscarFranklinTan20141208">{{Cite news |url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/80765/why-ateneo-is-honoring-edgar-jopson |title=Why Ateneo is honoring Edgar Jopson |last=Tan |first=Oscar Franklin |date=December 8, 2014 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |access-date=December 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Pimentel2006">{{Cite book |title=U.G. an underground tale: the journey of Edgar Jopson and the first quarter storm generation |last=Pimentel |first=Benjamin |date=2006 |publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc |isbn=9712715906 |location=Pasig |oclc=81146038}}</ref>

Marcos' declaration of [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|martial law]] in September 1972 saw the immediate shutdown of all media not approved by Marcos, including Quezon City media outlets, including the Manila-based [[Manila Times]], [[Philippines Free Press]], The Manila Tribune and the [[Philippines Herald]].

In 1975, Marcos formalized the creation of a region called Metropolitan Manila, incorporating the four cities of Manila, [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan]], [[Pasay]], and the thirteen municipalities of [[Las Piñas]], [[Makati]], [[Malabon]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Marikina]], [[Muntinlupa]], [[Navotas]], [[Parañaque]], [[Pasig]], [[Pateros]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Taguig]], and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]].

Despite Marcos' declaration of martial law, poverty and other social issues persisted, so even with the military in his control, Marcos could not hold back the unrest. A major turning point was reached in Tondo in the form of the [[1975 La Tondeña Distillery strike]] which was one of the first major open acts of resistance against the Marcos dictatorship which paved the way for similar protest actions elsewhere in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|title=10 anniversaries Filipinos should remember in 2015|url=https://globalnation.inquirer.net/116251/10-anniversaries-filipinos-should-remember-in-2015|last=Pimentel|first=Benjamin|date=December 30, 2014|website=Inquirer|language=en|access-date=May 5, 2020}}</ref> From then, Manila continued to be a center of resistance activity; youth and student demonstrators repeatedly clashed with the police and military.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mathews |first1=Jay |title=Philippine Police Arrest Hundreds To Block Protest |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/04/10/philippine-police-arrest-hundreds-to-block-protest/eee6d6d5-8852-42e0-a182-6cb6aae3c48b/ |access-date=January 12, 2023 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=April 10, 1978 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170828135407/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/04/10/philippine-police-arrest-hundreds-to-block-protest/eee6d6d5-8852-42e0-a182-6cb6aae3c48b/ |archive-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref>

Another major protest was the [[September 1984 Welcome Rotonda protest dispersal]] at the border of Manila and Quezon City, which came in the wake of the [[Aquino assassination]] the year before in 1983.

===The People Power revolution===
In late 1985, in the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a [[snap election]] with more than a year left in his term, selecting [[Arturo Tolentino]] as his running mate.

===Climate===
[[File:Climate-Manila (Philippines).svg|thumb|Temperature and rainfall]]

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Manila has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am''), closely bordering on a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''). Together with the rest of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means temperatures are high year-round especially during the daytime, rarely going below {{convert|19|°C|°F|1}} or above {{convert|39|°C|°F|1}}. Temperature extremes have ranged from {{convert|14.5|°C|°F}} on January 11, 1914,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Temperatures drop further in Baguio, MM |work=The Philippine Star |url=http://www.philstar.com:8080/nation/2014/01/01/1273885/temperatures-drop-further-baguio-mm |url-status=dead |access-date=October 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025102904/http://www.philstar.com:8080/nation/2014/01/01/1273885/temperatures-drop-further-baguio-mm |archive-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref> to {{convert|38.6|°C|°F}} on May 7, 1915.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Metro Manila temperature soars to 36.2C |work=ABS-CBN News |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/05/08/14/metro-manila-temperature-soars-362c |access-date=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

Humidity levels are usually very high all year round, making the air feel hotter than its actual temperature. Manila has a distinct [[dry season]] lasting from late December through early April, and a relatively lengthy [[wet season]] that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler daytime temperatures. In the wet season, rain rarely falls all day but rainfall is very heavy for short periods. [[Typhoon]]s usually occur from June to September.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manila |url=http://jeepneyguide.com/manila/travel-guide |access-date=March 4, 2014 |publisher=Jeepneyguide |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822140435/http://jeepneyguide.com/manila/travel-guide |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Almost all of Manila's pre-war and Spanish colonial architecture was destroyed during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|1945 Battle of Manila]] by intensive bombardment by the United States Air Force. Reconstruction took place afterward, replacing the destroyed historic Spanish-era buildings with modern ones, erasing much of the city's character. Some of the destroyed buildings, such as the Old Legislative Building (now the [[National Museum of Fine Arts (Manila)|National Museum of Fine Arts]]), [[Ayuntamiento de Manila]] (now the Bureau of the Treasury), and the under-construction [[San Ignacio Church (Manila)|San Ignacio Church and Convent]] (as the [[Museo de Intramuros]]), have been reconstructed. There are plans to refurbish and restore several neglected historic buildings and places such as Plaza Del Carmen, [[San Sebastian Church (Manila)|San Sebastian Church]], and the [[NCCA Metropolitan Theater]]. Spanish-era shops and houses in the districts of [[Binondo]], [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], and [[San Nicolas, Manila|San Nicolas]] are also planned to be restored as a part of a movement to restore the city to its pre-war state.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jenny F.

Because Manila is prone to earthquakes, Spanish colonial architects invented a style called [[Earthquake Baroque]], which churches and government buildings during the Spanish colonial period adopted.<ref name="City" /> As a result, succeeding earthquakes of the 18th and 19th centuries barely affected Manila, although they periodically leveled the surrounding area.

Given the complex population history of the Philippines, it is important to ensure that traditional methods for assessing the biological profile are appropriate when applied to these peoples. Here we analyze the classification trends of a modern Filipino sample (n = 110) when using the Fordisc 3.1 (FD3) software. We hypothesize that Filipinos represent an admixed population drawn largely from Asian and marginally from European parental gene pools, such that FD3 will classify these individuals morphometrically into reference samples that reflect a range of European admixture, in quantities from small to large. Our results show the greatest classification into Asian reference groups (72.7%), followed by Hispanic (12.7%), Indigenous American (7.3%), African (4.5%), and European (2.7%) groups included in FD3. This general pattern did not change between males and females. Moreover, replacing the raw craniometric values with their shape variables did not significantly alter the trends already observed. These classification trends for Filipino crania provide useful information for casework interpretation in forensic laboratory practice. Our findings can help biological anthropologists to better understand the evolutionary, population historical, and statistical reasons for FD3-generated classifications. The results of our studyindicate that ancestry estimation in forensic anthropology would benefit from population-focused research that gives consideration to histories of colonialism and periods of admixture. | access-date = September 13, 2020 | doi-access = }}</ref> Between the 1860s and 1890s, in urban areas of the Philippines&nbsp;– especially Manila&nbsp;– according to burial statistics, as much as 3.3% of the population were pure European Spaniards and pure Chinese composed 9.9% of the city's populace.

Sports in Manila have a long and distinguished history. The city's, and in general the country's, main sport is [[basketball]]. Most barangays have a basketball court or a makeshift one, and court markings are frequently drawn on the streets. Larger barangays have covered courts where inter-barangay leagues are held every April to May. Manila's major sports venues include [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]] and [[San Andres Gym]], the base of the now-defunct [[Manila Metrostars]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manila: Sports |url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Manila-Sports.html |access-date=January 15, 2010}}</ref> Rizal Memorial Sports Complex houses [[Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium|a track and football stadium]], [[Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium|a baseball stadium]], tennis courts, [[Rizal Memorial Coliseum]], and [[Ninoy Aquino Stadium]]; the latter two are indoor arenas. The Rizal complex had hosted several multi-sport events, such as the [[1954 Asian Games]] and the [[1934 Far Eastern Games]]. When the Philippines hosts the [[Southeast Asian Games]], most of the events are held at the complex but in the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 Games]], most events were held elsewhere. The [[1960 ABC Championship]] and the [[1973 ABC Championship]], forerunners of the [[FIBA Asia Championship]], were hosted at the memorial coliseum; the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|national basketball team]] won both tournaments.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Terrado |first1=Reuben |title=Five times the Philippines reigned as FIBA Asia Cup champion |url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/a-lookback-at-the-five-titles-of-the-philippines-in-the-fiba-asia-cup-a795-20220713 |access-date=December 30, 2022 |work=Sports Interactive Network Philippines |date=July 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713115605/https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/a-lookback-at-the-five-titles-of-the-philippines-in-the-fiba-asia-cup-a795-20220713 |archive-date=July 13, 2022 |language=en}}</ref> The [[1978 FIBA World Championship]] was held at the coliseum although the latter stages were held in the [[Araneta Coliseum]] in Quezon City.

Manila has several other well-known sports facilities such as [[Enrique M. Razon Sports Center]] and the [[University of Santo Tomas Sports Complex]], both of which are private venues owned by a university; [[collegiate sports]] are also held in the city; the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] basketball games held at Rizal Memorial Coliseum and Ninoy Aquino Stadium, although basketball events have been transferred to [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]'s [[Filoil Flying V Arena]] and Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Other collegiate sports are still held at Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. Professional basketball, which has been mostly organized by corporate teams, also used to play at the city but the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] now holds their games at Araneta Coliseum and [[Cuneta Astrodome]] at [[Pasay]]; the now-defunct [[Philippine Basketball League]] played some of their games, such as its [[1995–96 Philippine Basketball League season]], at Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Terrado |first1=Reuben |title=Remembering that grand slam-winning Stag team in the PBL |url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/remembering-the-1995-grand-slam-of-stag-pale-pilsen-in-the-pbl-a795-20200607 |access-date=September 9, 2022 |work=Spin.ph |date=June 7, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Almost twenty years later, [[Manila Stars]] participated in the [[Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League]], reaching the Northern Division Finals in 2019. Both teams played in the San Andres Sports Complex. Other teams that represented Manila but did not host games in the city are the [[Manila Jeepney F.C.]] and [[Loyola F.C.|FC Meralco Manila]]. The city's government acknowledged Jeepney as Manila's representative in the [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]].

Manila's [[rugby league]] team [[Manila Storm]] trains at Rizal Park and plays matches at Southern Plains Field, [[Calamba, Laguna]]. Baseball was previously a widely played sport in the city but in 2022, Manila had the Philippines' only sizable baseball stadium, [[Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium]], which hosted games of the now-defunct [[Baseball Philippines]]; [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Babe Ruth]] were the first players to score a [[home run]] at the stadium during their tour of the country on December 2, 1934.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Talao |first=Tito |date=March 10, 2004 |title=Baseball loses no time in preparing for SEAG |work=Manila Bulletin |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/158970 |url-status=dead |access-date=March 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913053124/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/158970 |archive-date=September 13, 2012}}</ref> [[Cue sports]] are also popular in Manila; billiard halls are present in most barangays.

Trolleys, hand-made human-powered metal handcarts operated by "trolley boys", transport people along sections of the PNR lines. This is a popular means of transportation because it is low-cost&nbsp;– roughly ₱10 or US$.20 per trip&nbsp;– and avoids traffic. Many trolley boys are homeless and live alongside the railroad line, which is actively used by passenger trains, making collisions with passenger trains a consistent danger, although casualties are rare. The trolley rides are unofficial and unregulated but tolerated by authorities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The "trolley boys" who dance with death on Manila's railway carts |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2174876/trolley-boys-who-dance-death-manilas-railway-carts |newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=November 25, 2018 |access-date=April 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Trolley boys' cheat death to make a living |url=https://manilastandard.net/news/top-stories/281422/-trolley-boys-cheat-death-to-make-a-living.html |newspaper=Manila Standard|date=November 25, 2018 |access-date=April 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Manila's "trolley boys" |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-46828430 |agency=BBC|access-date=April 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=The trolley boys of Manila – in pictures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2018/nov/26/the-trolley-boys-of-manila-in-pictures |newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 26, 2018 |access-date=April 19, 2021}}</ref>
