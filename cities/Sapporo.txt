The city's annual average precipitation is around {{cvt|1100|mm|1}}, and the mean annual temperature is {{cvt|8.5|°C|1}}.<ref name="normals" />

The highest temperature ever recorded in Sapporo was {{cvt|36.3|C}} on August 23, 2023.<ref name="extremes" /> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{cvt|-28.5|C}} on 1 February 1929.<ref name="extremes" />

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Before its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to indigenous [[Ainu people|Ainu]] settlements.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7437244.stm Recognition at last for Japan's Ainu ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108102235/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7437244.stm |date=November 8, 2017 }}". BBC News. July 6, 2008</ref> In 1866, at the end of the [[Edo period]], construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.<ref name=city>{{cite web |url=http://hometown.infocreate.co.jp/hokkaido/sapporo/rekisi.html |script-title=ja:サイト閉鎖のお知らせ |access-date=October 7, 2007 |archive-date=June 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619005223/http://hometown.infocreate.co.jp/hokkaido/sapporo/rekisi.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the "birth" of Sapporo, the new [[Meiji period|Meiji]] government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of [[Hakodate, Hokkaido|Hakodate]], was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well-drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.

During 1870–1871, [[Kuroda Kiyotaka]], vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, [[Horace Capron]], [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] under President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], became an ''[[oyatoi gaikokujin]]'' and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around [[Odori Park]], which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a [[grid plan]] with streets at right-angles to form city blocks. The continuing expansion of the Japanese into around Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of [[Honshu]] immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882. In 1871, the [[Hokkaidō Shrine]] was built in its current location as the Sapporo Shrine.

[[Edwin Dun]] came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government. [[William S. Clark]], who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]), came to be the founding vice-president of the [[Sapporo Agricultural College]] (now [[Hokkaido University]]) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an "ethics" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the college.

In 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as "Sapporo-ku" (Sapporo Ward),<ref name=2nd>{{Nihongo|New Sapporo History 2nd edition|新札幌市史　第2巻|Shin Sapporo Shishi}}</ref> and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, [[Otaru, Hokkaido|Otaru]] was laid. That year the [[Hōheikan]], a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was built adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to [[Nakajima Park]] where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaidō was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.<ref name=2nd/>

Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and [[Former Hokkaidō Government Office|Hokkaidō government office building]], an American-[[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-baroque]]-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in [[Kita-ku, Sapporo]] is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun.<ref name=2nd/> The "ku" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/ss/scs/grp/localautonomy.pdf |script-title=ja:北海道市町村自治制の沿革概要 |publisher=Government of Hokkaido |language=ja |access-date=November 11, 2018 |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111043801/http://www.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/ss/scs/grp/localautonomy.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
In 1907, the [[Tohoku Imperial University]] was established in [[Sendai]] Miyagi Prefecture, and [[Sapporo Agricultural College]] was controlled by the university. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.

The [[Sapporo Streetcar]] was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth [[National Seven Universities|Imperial University]] in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the Jōzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.

In 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City.<ref name="city" /> The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the [[1940 Winter Olympics]], but due to the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Chūō-ku in 1940, and the [[Okadama Airport]] was constructed in 1942. During [[World War II]], the city was [[Air raids on Japan#Naval air attacks|bombed by American naval aircraft]] in July 1945.<ref name="Asahi Shimbun">{{Cite web |last=[[The Asahi Shimbun]] |title=朝日新聞デジタル：空襲の記憶 風化させぬ - 北海道 - 地域 |url=http://www.asahi.com/area/hokkaido/articles/MTW20151209011470014.html |access-date=2022-04-13 |website=www.asahi.com |language=ja |archive-date=14 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414064109/http://www.asahi.com/area/hokkaido/articles/MTW20151209011470014.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

The first [[Sapporo Snow Festival]] was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku.<ref name="sapporo">{{Nihongo|New Sapporo History 5th edition|新札幌市史　第5巻|Shin Sapporo Shishi}}</ref> In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Chūō-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku.<ref name="sapporo" /> The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.<ref name="sapporo" />

The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The [[Sapporo Municipal Subway]] system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia.<ref name="city" /> On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the [[City designated by government ordinance|cities designated by government ordinance]], and seven wards were established.<ref name="sapporo" /> The last public performance by the opera singer, [[Maria Callas]], was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974.<ref>Sutherland, Robert ''Maria Callas Diaries of a Friendship'' London Constable 1999 p265 {{ISBN|0-09-478790-5}}</ref> The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the Tōzai line started operation in 1976, and the Tōhō line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the [[Pacific Music Festival]] in 1990, and Yosakoi Sōran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, [[Consadole Sapporo]], was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, [[Hokkaido Takushoku Bank|Hokkaidō Takushoku Bank]], a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tokachi.co.jp/kachi/9811/11_14.htm |title=lawsuit against the bankruptcy of the Takushoku Bank |access-date=2007-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222071247/http://www.tokachi.co.jp/kachi/9811/11_14.htm |archive-date=2007-12-22 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:2008 G8 Summit Antiglobalist Demonstration March.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[34th G8 summit]] protest march in 2008]]
In 2001 the construction of the [[Sapporo Dome]] was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]: Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] team, [[Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters]], in 2004, which won the [[2006 Japan Series]], and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-Dōri (a street in front of [[Sapporo Station]]) in February 2007.

The [[34th G8 summit]] took place in [[Tōyako, Hokkaido|Tōyako]] in 2008, and a number of people including [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, while four people were arrested in the demonstrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/arrests-made-during-scuffles-at-g8-protest-in-japan-1.735944 |title=Arrests made during scuffles at G8 protest in Japan |date=5 July 2008 |access-date=January 26, 2020 |archive-date=January 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124164435/https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/arrests-made-during-scuffles-at-g8-protest-in-japan-1.735944 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Some structures built for Olympic events remain in use today, including the ski jumps at [[Miyanomori Ski Jump Stadium|Miyanomori]] and [[Okurayama Ski Jump Stadium|Okurayama]]. After considering a bid for the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2030 Winter Olympics]], Olympic representatives in Sapporo have said that the city is considering a bid for the 2034 Winter Olympics.
