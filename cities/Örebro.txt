It is situated by the [[Närke]] [[Plain]], near the lake [[Hjälmaren]], a few kilometers inland along the small river [[Svartån, Närke|Svartån]], and has a population of approximately 126,000 in the [[city proper]].<ref name=scb2>{{cite web|title=Population in localities increased by 120 000|url=https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/environment/land-use/localities-areas-population/pong/statistical-news/population-in-localities/|website=Statistiska Centralbyrån|access-date=15 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> It is one of the largest inland hubs of the country, and a major [[Logistics|logistic]] and commercial operating site.

Örebro is home to [[Örebro University]], a [[Örebro University Hospital|major university hospital]], a [[Örebro Castle|medieval castle]], the [[water park]] [[Gustavsvik]] as well as several large shopping malls and the [[Oset and Rynningeviken Nature Reserve]] adjacent to lake Hjälmaren.

Örebro is served by [[Örebro Airport]] 10 km (6 mi) southwest of the city, and by [[Örebro Central Station]], serviced by the [[Mälaren Line]] and [[Western Main Line]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Örebro'' refers to a bridge (''{{lang|sv|bro}}'') crossing the river [[Svartån, Närke|Svartån]] where the city is located. The prefix ''{{lang|sv|Öre-}}'' is derived from ''{{lang|sv|ör}}'' 'gravel ([[bank (geography)|bank]])'.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/download/18.5850f85e15732ead0b325e/1474034387007/Svenskt+ortnamslexikon.pdf |title=Svenskt ortnamnslexikon |date=2003 |publisher=[[Swedish Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research]] |isbn=91-7229-020-X |editor-last=Wahlberg |editor-first=Mats |edition=1st |location=Uppsala |pages=388–389 |language=sv |access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref> 

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
{{See also|History of Närke}}
[[File:Suecia 2-048 ; Örebro.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Örebro {{c.|1700}}, in ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna|Suecia antiqua et hodierna]]'', with the castle in the middle]]

Örebro received its [[Royal Charter]] and city privileges not later than 1404.

The location became a natural seat of commerce in the Scandinavian Middle Ages and is mentioned in print in the 13th century. Old buildings from the early days include the foundations of the city church, a building which has undergone several modifications. The natural center of the city is otherwise [[Örebro Castle]], situated on an islet in the Svartån, and dividing the town into a northern and a southern part. This castle was constructed during the stewardship of [[Birger Jarl]] during the late 13th century and then modified and enlarged during the reign of King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] in the 1560s. The [[Örebro Synod]] was held here in 1529.

Notable events in Örebro's history include the national [[diet (assembly)|diet]] meeting at Örebro in 1810, where [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]] was [[Elective monarchy|elected crown prince]] of Sweden.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2013-04-22 |title=Jean Baptiste Bernadotte blev svensk kronprins i Örebro |language=sv |work=[[Sveriges Radio]] |url=https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/5512401 |access-date=2022-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lindqvist |first=Herman |author-link=Herman Lindqvist (journalist) |date=21 August 2009 |title=Jean Baptiste Bernadottes väg till makten |url=https://popularhistoria.se/sveriges-historia/kungar-drottningar/jean-baptiste-bernadottes-vag-till-makten |access-date=13 December 2022 |website=Popularhistoria.se |language=sv}}</ref>

Although a trade town, Örebro remained small until the second half of the 19th century, when it grew rapidly as a center of the national [[shoe]]-manufacturing industry.

==Climate==
[[File:Örebro University Hospital 03.jpg|thumb|Recreation area at [[Örebro University Hospital]]]]
Örebro, like the rest of the area close to Mälardalen, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Dfb) that is made milder by the proximity to water and the [[Gulf Stream]] which makes it interchangeable with [[oceanic climate]]s. Summer temperatures occasionally exceed {{convert|30|C|F}} albeit not yearly, and temperatures above {{convert|5|C|F}} are rare in winter, although frost-free nights sometimes occur. July average high temperatures generally range from {{convert|20|C|F}} to {{convert|26|C|F}} depending on weather patterns, with a 2002–2021 mean high of around {{convert|23.5|C|F}}. July lows averaged {{convert|12.3|C|F}}, sizeably cooler than seaside areas. January averaged {{convert|0.7|C|F}} average highs in the same timeframe, with average lows of {{convert|-5|C|F}}.

During cold winters, Örebro receives plenty of snowfall. Örebro is far more prone than coastal areas to really harsh frosts with temperatures approaching or below {{convert|-20|C|F}} happening almost every winter according to SMHI statistics. The station's setting in a rural location might skew temperatures somewhat compared to the urban area which is also at a slightly lower elevation and nearer [[Lake Hjälmaren|Hjälmaren]]. Especially when considering overnight lows this could result in a small [[urban heat island]] effect in downtown.

However, the climate is very variable from year to year. For example, December 2010 was record cold with a daily mean of {{convert|-9|C|F}}, whilst December 2006 only a few years before had a mean of {{convert|4.3|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_dec10.pdf?18701|title=December – air temperature and wind (2010)|publisher=SMHI|language=sv|access-date=28 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_clouds_dec06.pdf?18701|title=December – air temperature and clouds (2006)|publisher=SMHI|language=sv|access-date=28 July 2015}}</ref> The warmest month on record is {{convert|21.8|C|F}} in July 2018 and the coldest on record is {{convert|-12.8|C|F}} in January 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smhi.se/pd/klimat/pdf_stats/month/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul18.pdf|title=July – air temperature and wind (July 2018 – all-time record section)|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=22 July 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smhi.se/pd/klimat/pdf_stats/month/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan22.pdf|title=January – air temperature and wind (2022 – all-time record section)|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=21 July 2022}}</ref> Örebro is often without snow cover for large parts of the winter months when daytime temperatures hover just above freezing – an exceptional feature for an inland area north of the 59th latitude. The westerly Atlantic moderating influence is strong enough that far inland Örebro has milder winters than the near-coastal town [[Norrtälje#Climate|Norrtälje]], located slightly farther north on the [[Baltic Sea]] with a similar rural weather station.

The highest ever recorded temperature was set on 7 August 1975 during an intense heatwave with {{convert|36|C|F}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_aug14.pdf?54441|title=August 2014 – Air Temperature and Wind|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)|access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref> which is a very high temperature for such northerly latitudes.

In 2015, a {{convert|13.1|C|F}} reading was recorded around the winter solstice which was a very warm reading for an inland area in the low-sun season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://na.se/nyheter/sverige/1.3382466-13-1-orebros-nya-varmerekord|title=13,1 – nytt värmerekord för Örebro|language=sv|publisher=Nerikes Allehanda|date=20 December 2015|access-date=20 December 2015}}</ref>

Being unshielded by the [[South Swedish highlands]] [[rain shadow]], moist westerly air results in higher precipitation than on Baltic Sea locations. Summer [[convection]] and the flat topography of downtown can result in [[flash floods]] of low areas. Resulting from that, Örebro has been deemed one of the most vulnerable areas in Sweden to flooding and saw several incidents in a record wet summer in 2023.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msb.se/siteassets/dokument/amnesomraden/skydd-mot-olyckor-och-farliga-amnen/naturolyckor-och-klimat/oversvamning/riskhanteringsplaner-2022-2027/riskhanteringsplan-orebro-inkl-bilagor.pdf|title=Riskhanteringsplan för översvämning i Örebro tätort 2022-2027|trans-title=Risk management plan for floods in Örebro town 2022-2027|publisher=[[Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskap|MSB]]|language=sv|access-date=21 December 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/orebro/stora-oversvamningar-i-orebro-lan-over-30-larm-hittills|title=Stora översvämningar i Örebro län|trans-title=Large floods in Örebro County|publisher=[[Sveriges Television|SVT Örebro]]|language=sv|date=14 August 2023|access-date=21 December 2023}}</ref>
