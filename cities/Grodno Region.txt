'''Grodno Region''', also known as '''Grodno Oblast'''{{efn|{{langx|ru|Гродненская область|Grodnenskaya oblast'}}; {{langx|pl|Obwód Grodzieński}}.}} or '''Hrodna Voblasts''',{{efn|{{langx|be|Гродзенская вобласць|Hrodzienskaja voblasć}}.}} is one of the [[regions of Belarus]]. Its administrative center, [[Grodno]], is the largest city in the region. As of 2024, it has a population of 992,556.<ref name="pop"/>

Located in western [[Belarus]], it lies on the [[Neman|Neman River]]. The region borders [[Minsk Region]] to the east, [[Brest Region]] to the south, [[Poland]] ([[Podlaskie Voivodeship]]) to the west and [[Vitebsk Region]] and [[Lithuania]] ([[Alytus County|Alytus]] and [[Vilnius County|Vilnius]] counties) to the north. Grodno's existence has been attested since 1127.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
{{copyedit section|date=September 2023}}
This region comprised the westernmost "borderlands" of the [[Early East Slavs]] (tribal union [[Dregoviches]]?) on the lands of the [[Balts]] in the 6th-9th centuries CE. In the 12th-14th centuries it formed part of the area sometimes known as [[Black Ruthenia]], which the [[List of rulers of Lithuania#Grand Duchy of Lithuania |rulers of Lithuania]] fully incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (GDL) in the 13th century. The Baltic tribe [[Yotvingians]] who inhabited the Grodno Region became [[Lithuanization|Lithuanized]], especially during the formation of the State of [[Lithuania]] in the 13th century, and subsequently for a long time Grodno and its area was a part of the [[Ethnographic Lithuania]] (e.g. even in the 19th century the Lithuanian-inhabited areas were still nearby the present-day suburbs of Grodno city).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vidugiris |first1=Aloyzas |title=Gardino sritis |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/gardino-sritis/ |website=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija]] |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref>

In 1413, the area became administratively divided between of the newly established [[Trakai Voivodeship]] and [[Vilnius Voivodeship]], and in 1507, the southern part of the current oblast became part of the newly formed [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1507–1795)|Nowogródek Voivodeship]]. Historical cities of greatest importance were [[Grodno]], seat of Grodno County and one of the main royal residences of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, [[Nowogródek]], provincial capital since 1507, county seats of [[Vawkavysk]], [[Slonim]] and [[Lida]], and [[Mir, Belarus|Mir]], [[private town]] of the powerful [[Radziwiłł family]], which were granted [[Magdeburg Law]] charters in 1441, 1511, 1503, 1532, 1590 and 1579 respectively.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rewieńska|first=Wanda|title=Miasta i miasteczka magdeburskie w woj. wileńskim i nowogródzkim|year=1938|location=Lida|language=pl|pages=11–12}}</ref>

The strong economic development of the area continued during the reign of Casimir's son - Duke [[Alexander Jagiellon]] of Lithuania ({{reign | 1492 | 1506}}), who founded the first solid bridge over the [[Neman River]] as well as the Monastery of the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] and the Monastery of the Polish ''[[Ordo Fratrum Minorum]]''. Later, [[Bona Sforza]], Queen consort of Poland and Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania between 1518 and 1548, established her royal residence in Grodno. According to medieval surveys, Grodno had 35 streets and 700 houses in 1558.

The golden age of Grodno came with the reign of [[Stephen Báthory]], King of Poland  from 1576 to 1586. During his reign, Grodno became a royal headquarters and began to host sessions of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] Senate and Parliament. In 1580, on the king's order, [[Old Grodno Castle |the castle of Grodno]] was rebuilt in [[Renaissance]] architectural style by Scoto di Parma.

[[File:Horadnia, Novy zamak. Горадня, Новы замак (XVIII).jpg|thumb|left|18th-century view of the New Castle in Grodno]]
At the beginning of the 17th century, Grodno, one of the most developed and important cities in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], was traditionally recognized as the third capital of the commonwealth. Deterioration of the province's status began with the [[Livonian War]] of 1558 to 1583, which pitted the  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the [[Swedish Empire]] in a lengthy and exhausting military conflict against the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Between 1765 and 1780, the province regained some of its previous status when [[Antoni Tyzenhaus]], the Treasurer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Administrator of Polish Royal Estates, governed the capital and the province. Tyzenhaus fostered around 50 new commercial endeavors in the region with the building of manufactures, mills and workshops.

As part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and due to subsequent [[Partitions of Poland]], the whole of the Grodno region was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] by the end of 1795. The city of Grodno then became a seat for the [[Grodno Governorate]].

During [[World War I]] the governorate was occupied by Germany. German troops entered Grodno city on 3 September 1915, plundering the ''Library of Dominicans Order''. During the German occupation, Polish citizens of Grodno region were persecuted and had restricted civil rights. Towards the end of the war, the [[Belarusian People's Republic]] (BNR) declared its independence from [[Soviet Russia]] in March 1918 in [[Minsk]]. Grodno was the site of the last stand of the [[Rada of the Belarusian People's Republic |BNR's Council]] (''[[Rada]]''). Soon, the council was forced to flee as Soviet troops invaded the region and the city in 1919. The same year the [[Polish–Soviet War]] broke out; it continued until 1921.

[[File:Lida, Vilenskaja-Rynak. Ліда, Віленская-Рынак (1930).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lida]] in the 1930s]]
Under the terms of the [[Peace Treaty of Riga]] the region and the city returned to the [[Second Polish Republic]] which claimed rights to this territory as a successor to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and as a victorious side of the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. By 1939, Grodno city had 60,000 inhabitants, with Poles and [[Jews]] accounting for 60% and 37% of the population, respectively. During Polish rule, Grodno was centre of [[Grodno County (1919-1939)|Grodno County]] in [[Białystok Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Białystok Voivodeship]], but some parts of present Grodno Region were in the voivodeships of [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–39)|Nowogródek]] and [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926–39)|Wilno]].

After [[World War II]] started, on 17 September 1939, the Grodno area [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|was invaded by Soviet Union]] and incorporated by force to the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Over 300 captured Polish defenders of Grodno, including Polish Army officers and youth, were massacred by the Soviets.<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Agresja sowiecka na Polskę i okupacja wschodnich terenów Rzeczypospolitej 1939–1941|year=2019|language=pl|location=Białystok-Warszawa|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|page=9|isbn=978-83-8098-706-7}}</ref> Grodno was located in the newly established [[Belastok Region]]. Thousands were imprisoned or deported to [[Siberia]] or [[Kazakhstan]].{{Why|date=November 2021}} In the early summer of 1941 the region fell under [[Nazi German]] occupation. In November 1941, German occupants established the [[Grodno Ghetto]] for Jewish citizens of Grodno and the rest of the region. In 1942, after a year of severe persecution and planned starvation of ghetto inhabitants, 10,000 Jews from Grodno were deported to the German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] and murdered there. Next year, in 1943, 17,000 of the surviving ghetto inhabitants were again deported to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] as well as to the[[Treblinka extermination camp]] and the [[Białystok Ghetto]]. Although on 13 March 1943, German troops reported the end of the extermination and described Grodno city as ''judenrein'' (free of Jews), around 50 Jews survived, some hidden by non-Jewish families. Polish and Soviet underground forces acted in the region. Villages like [[Dziarečyn]], which originally had large Jewish populations, were greatly reduced.

As a result of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s policy of expansion to the west, it was decided during the [[Yalta Conference]] that the Polish eastern border shall be set along the so-called "original" [[Curzon Line]]. Based on this decision, the left-bank part of Grodno town would be kept within the borders of Poland. It is actually not clear till today, how the original Curzon Line near Grodno has been moved by around 20&nbsp;km to the west. When the so-called "mistake" (today regarded rather as sabotage within British ministry structures) became obvious to negotiators, Stalin refused to correct the mistaken line. Despite multiple and desperate appeals from Polish citizens of Grodno, the whole Grodno region, including the [[Sapotskin]] Triangle (ethnically Polish till today), was incorporated to the [[Soviet Belarus]] and many Poles emigrated or were expelled.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1944, [[Belastok Region]] was dissolved and Grodno Region established.

Since 1991, the Grodno Region constitutes one of six regions of independent [[Belarus]].

==Heritage and tourism==
The main tourist attractions in the region are numerous old architectural constructions such as castles in [[Mir Castle Complex|Mir]], [[Lida Castle|Lida]], and [[Navahrudak Castle|Novogrudok]]. A part of [[Białowieża Forest]] is situated here, but the tourist excursions start from the [[Brest Region]] part of the National Park. [[Zhyrovichy Monastery]] is also a destination for religious travellers.
The [[Mir Castle Complex]] and [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park]] are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. There are objects of the Belarusian Cultural heritage list, such as the [[Church of Saint Anthony of Padua in Kamienka]], [[St. Francis Xavier Cathedral, Grodno|St. Francis Xavier Cathedral]], [[St Andrew's Church, Slonim|St Andrew's Church]] in [[Slonim]], and the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Gierviaty|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in [[Hyervyaty]]. Two castles dating from the 14th to 18th centuries are located in Grodno on the steep right bank of the Nemen. One of the city's surviving masterpieces is the 12th century [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Kalozha Church|Church of St Boris & St Gleb (Kalozhskaya Church)]], which is the second oldest in Belarus. There is a museum dedicated to poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]] in his childhood home in [[Novogrudok]].
