The city is located about 32 kilometres northeast of [[Pyongyang]], and was formally established in December 1969. It has a population of 284,386.<ref name="Nkorea2008">[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_PHC/North_Korea/Final%20national%20census%20report.pdf Central Bureau of Statistics, Pyongyang, DPR Korea; 2008 Population Census, National Report ('''pdf-fil''')] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331091148/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_PHC/North_Korea/Final%20national%20census%20report.pdf |date=2010-03-31 }} Läst 17 januari 2010.</ref>

== History ==
The area that is now Pyongsong was formerly [[Pyongyang]] and [[South Pyongan Province]]. This was first formed in 1965 from various parts of the two regions, and was designated a ''gu'' ([[List of second-level administrative divisions of North Korea|district]]). Various other parts were merged into the district, and it was promoted to ''si'' (city) in 1969, also becoming the capital of South Pyongan Province.<ref name="북한지역정보넷">{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0101&direct=1&ac=A0202|access-date=2021-10-09|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref> South Korean sources claim that [[Kim Il-sung]] named the city. The name comes from combining Pyongyang and the word for fortress in Korean.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Profiles of the cities of DPR Korea – Phyongsong|url=https://www.univie.ac.at/koreanologie/fileadmin/user_upload/DigitalNK/Forschungsarbeit/Phyongsong.pdf}}</ref>

In 1995, Toksong-dong, Paesan-dong, Songnyong-dong and a part of Jikyong-dong were split from the city and placed under the jurisdiction of Pyongyang through [[Unjong-guyok]]. The rest of Jikyong-dong was absorbed by Hacha-dong and it was abolished.<ref name="북한지역정보넷"/>

On 27 November 2017, a [[Hwasong-15]] was fired from the city.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-11-29|title=North Korea's Third ICBM Launch {{!}} 38 North: Informed Analysis of North Korea|url=https://www.38north.org/2017/11/melleman112917/|access-date=2021-10-09|website=38 North|language=en}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
P'yŏngsŏng-si is divided into 20 ''[[Administrative divisions of North Korea|dong]]'' (neighbourhoods) and 14 ''[[Administrative divisions of North Korea|ri]]'' (villages):

== Economy ==
The city has small scale nuclear and physics research facilities, which are controlled by the [[State Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-08-03|title=Much Ado About Kangson {{!}} 38 North: Informed Analysis of North Korea|url=https://www.38north.org/2018/08/mmadden080318/|access-date=2021-10-09|website=38 North|language=en}}</ref>

28% of the land is used for farming and fruits are grown in the villages.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0103&direct=1&ac=A0202|access-date=2021-10-09|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

Due to location and good transport, P'yŏngsŏng-si is the location of many wholesale businesses importing products from China.<ref name="reuters-20150604">{{cite news|author=James Pearson, Ju-min Park|date=4 June 2015|title=Pyongyang Bling: The rise of North Korea's consumer comrades|publisher=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-change-consumption-idUSKBN0OJ2UH20150604|access-date=12 April 2017}}</ref> This is because many traders do not possess [[Travel Permit|travel permits]] to enter Pyongyang and with Pyongsong being the point where permits to enter Pyongyang are checked, they must resell their goods onwards at Pyongsong. These markets also sell onto other cities, including [[Haeju]] and [[Sariwon]]. It is also more efficient to send goods to the east coast cities of [[Wonsan]] than directly from [[Sinuiju]]. In 2009, the market was split into two smaller ones, because allegedly, the market was seen as a threat due to its capitalistic influence according to the [[Korea Herald]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Industry ===
The Phyongsong Synthetic Leather factory, the Phyongsong rubber band factory, an agricultural machine factory and the Moranbong watch factory are four major factories in the city.<ref name=":0" />

==== March 16 Factory/ Phyongnam General Machine Plant ====
The largest and most important factory in Pyongsong is March 16 factory, also known as the Pyongsang Auto Works, with an area of 248000m² and employing an estimated 7000 to 8000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|title=TAEPAEKSAN 70 {{!}} chinesecars|url=https://www.chinesecars.net/content/taepaeksan-70|access-date=2021-10-09|website=www.chinesecars.net}}</ref> It was established on 16 March 1977. However, its location is disputed, as it is supposed to be located in Kuwol-dong, while south Korean sources claim that it part of the Thaebaeksan company, which is listed in Paesan-dong, and would thus be a part of Pyongyang.<ref name=":0" />

The factory has roads leading to [[Pyongyang]] and [[Sunchon]], and has produced the Kaengsang 69 and Kaengsang 85 jeeps,<ref>{{Cite web|title=KAENGSAENG 85 {{!}} chinesecars|url=https://www.chinesecars.net/content/kaengsaeng-85|access-date=2021-10-09|website=www.chinesecars.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=KAENGSAENG 68KA {{!}} chinesecars|url=https://www.chinesecars.net/content/kaengsaeng-68ka|access-date=2021-10-09|website=www.chinesecars.net}}</ref> the Taebaeksan truck series, [[Armoured personnel carrier|armoured vehicles]] and more recently, the Taebaeksan-96, a locally assembled KamAZ-55111 as a result of a 2007 partnership with [[Kamaz]].<ref name=":0" /> The factory also likely produces or modifies [[transporter erector launcher]]s, used to carry the [[Hwasong-15]] missile and modifies [[China National Heavy Duty Truck Group|Sinotruck]] vehicles to be [[multiple rocket launcher]]s.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2020-09-22|title=North Korea renovates key missile launcher factory ahead of big military parade|url=https://www.nknews.org/pro/north-korea-renovates-key-missile-launcher-factory-ahead-of-big-military-parade/|access-date=2021-10-09|website=NK PRO|language=en-US}}</ref> Although the production of KamAZ trucks possibly ended in 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Satellite photos show work on North Korean site linked to long-range missiles|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/exclusive-satellite-photos-show-work-north-korean-site-linked-long-n1106176|access-date=2021-10-09|website=NBC News|language=en}}</ref> other models of KamAZ trucks were still seen in the facility.<ref name=":1" />

A temporary structure was built in 2017, which appeared to be used to support the development of TEL vehicles, similar to those at the [[Chonchon County|No.65 Factory at Jonchon]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-12|title=Shelter Recently Dismantled at March 16 Factory|url=https://www.38north.org/2018/09/march16factory091218-2/|access-date=2021-10-09|website=38 North|language=en}}</ref>

In 2019, various buildings were reconstructed, likely as ordered by [[Kim Jong-un]]. All roads within the factory were repaved and some structures were removed, while a livestock facility saw some progress. However, the roads within the factory still appear to have turn radii too small for the TEL of the Hwasong-15, potentially indicating that large scale production of these vehicles had not yet occurred, although [[NK News]] analysts believe that it could be nonetheless a step towards production.<ref name=":1" />

=== Education ===
Having been initially established with the idea of functioning as a center for North Korea's science and technology sectors, Pyongsong-si is the location of several colleges, universities, and research center:

*Pyongsong University of Science - reputed to include a nuclear physics department, the researchers of which contribute to North Korea's nuclear program. The department runs the Atomic Energy Research Institute.<ref name="Source">{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/dprk/facility/pyongsong.htm|title=Pyongsong - North Korean Special Weapons Facilities}}</ref><ref name="Pyongsong Overview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreakonsult.com/Attraction_Pyongsong_eng.html|title=Pyongsong city guide, North Korea}}</ref>
* Pyongsong University of Medicine (functions as South Pyongan province's regional medical training institute)
* Space Science Research Institute
*Phyongsong University of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry<ref>{{Cite web|title=Higher education updated|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=32267|access-date=2021-10-09|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref>

== Nature ==
Pyongsong is located at an average of 100–200 metres above sea level, although the western part of the city is mostly mountains. Forests cover 53% of the city, consisting various trees, such as [[oak]], [[birch]], [[acacia]], [[maple]] and [[alder tree]]s. Pyongsong has a [[continental climate]]. There are various [[precious metal]]s located in the area. The [[Taedong River]] flows through the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0102&direct=1&ac=A0202|access-date=2021-10-09|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{portal|North Korea}}
P'yŏngsŏng-si has two stations on the [[Pyongra Line|P'yŏngra Line]] of the [[Korean State Railway]], one in [[P'yŏngsŏng Station|P'yŏngsŏng-dong]] and one in [[Ponghak Station|Ponghak-dong]].

Pyongsong has one [[trolleybus]] line. The network opened on August 4, 1983, from Munwha-dong to [[Pyongsong station]] and extended in 1992 by 5.2&nbsp;km to Paesan-dong. However, between 1996 and 2005, the line between Pyongsong station and Kwangmyong-dong (now part of [[Unjong-guyok]], Pyongyang) was cut, splitting the originally connected lines, likely as a result of the division of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pyongsong|url=https://transphoto.org/city/1757/|access-date=2020-10-19|website=transphoto.org}}</ref> In 2015, there were around 12 trolleybuses including three articulated trolleybuses reported to be in service on the Munhwa-dong to Pyongsong station line,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beitrag – trolley:motion|url=https://www.trolleymotion.eu/trolleynews/beitrag/?id=6410|access-date=2021-10-09|language=de-DE}}</ref> reduced to 8 trolleybuses after the articulated trolleybuses were retired between 2015 and 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beitrag – trolley:motion|url=https://www.trolleymotion.eu/trolleynews/beitrag/?id=8564|access-date=2021-10-09|language=de-DE}}</ref>
