'''San Juan del Río''' is a city (2010 census pop. 241,699) and administration of the surrounding [[San Juan del Río Municipality, Querétaro|San Juan del Río Municipality]] (pop. 208,462) in the central [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[List of states of Mexico|state]] of [[Querétaro]]. The population in for the municipality is 268,408 as of 2015.

The city and its municipality have the second-highest population in the state. The municipality has an area of {{convert|799.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

The city is located on country's central plateau (altiplano), {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of state capital, [[Santiago de Querétaro]], at {{coord|20|23|N|99|59|W|}} with an elevation of 1922 m. Although famous for its opals, mined at nearby La Trinidad, it is also an agricultural center (corn, wheat, sugarcane, beans, alfalfa, fruit, and livestock). A number of wineries are also located in the vicinity.

San Juan del Río is connected to Santiago de Querétaro and [[Mexico City]] by the mainline freight railway and [[List of Mexican Federal Highways|Federal Highway 57]].

==History==
The city was founded on the Feast of [[Saint John the Baptist]] June 24, 1531, by Fernando de Tapia, an [[Otomi people|Otomí]] [[tribal chief|chieftain]] that converted to [[Catholicism]] and dropped his Native name [[Conín]]. San Juan was one of the first Spanish settlements outside the [[Mexico City|Valley of Mexico]] and thus marked the beginning of the colonization of Northern and Western Mexico, including the city of [[Santiago de Querétaro|Querétaro]], which was founded one month later. The settlement became important since it was an obligated stop during the rich mining regions of [[Guanajuato]], [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potosí]].

===Pre-Hispanic era===
In what now occupies the municipal area of San Juan del Río, on the bank of the river that bears the same name, discoveries of the ancient Otomí culture who have the ancestry of Chupícuaro have been found, legacies indicating that the area was inhabited around 400 BC. The ancient settlers were sedentary gatherers; carriers of a complex culture and way of life. It is considered one of the oldest social organizations in the Mexican highlands. The Otomí culture made very important advances, especially in the cultivation of maize, beans, pumpkin, and Agave.
The Otomí, after having great advantages in agriculture, were grouped in the region around the hill Techimacit (today Barrio de la Cruz); in the glen that forms the riverbed; they built their houses forming the village they called Ixtachichimecapan, which means land of white Chichimecas, and whose chief it was Mexici who later had the Christian name of John.

===Foundation===
San Juan del Río was founded as a village of Indians on the day June 24 Thyrean bonfires of 1531 (although for some authors, such as Agustín Ruiz Olloqui the true date of the foundation is June 24, 1526, which appears in a document of the colony dealing about water and which currently remains in the Municipal Historical Archive), and was named for that day being the feast of [[John the Baptist|San Juan Bautista]], and because it remained on the banks of a flowing river, it usually had the suffix, "Of The River". It is around this date that the city fair is held annually, in which bullfights, games, concerts, and other cultural events take place. San Juan del Río is sometimes confused with [[Santiago de Querétaro]], a frontier of safeguarding during the confrontation between the Chichimecas groups called barbarians and vice royal expansionism; later, the two cities were the middle ground between [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potosí]] mining hubs with Mexico City.

===Colonial Age===
Once the village was founded and conquered peacefully, the organizational and building work began; the first chapel of the village built by the Franciscan religious was built and the main streets were drawn "on an area of 2,500 square rods of good land and gentle slope". The Village of San Juan del Río, the head of its Jurisdiction, is founded on a hillside near the North and Westeros that tops in a broken valley, which is surrounded by all parts of hills.

Constructive work during the sixteenth century (1500s) was restricted to the scope of the organization of the town and to solve certain immediate problems. One of the first urban elements of community use was the construction of the bridge over the San Juan River, which practically left the population not being able to communicate with each other during the rainy season. This case concerned both the San Juanan population and the interests of the vice royal government, mainly because it was a place of transit and rest for the constant travelers with silver shipments, who came from the North to Mexico City. The bridge that alleviated the problem is attributed to Fray Sebastián de Aparicio and was built in 1561 (today Benito Juárez avenue, in front of the municipal pantheon). Since traffic over the bridge was constant, in 1621 it had to be rebuilt.

== The 18th century ==
[[File:Avenidajuarez.jpg|thumb|Av. Juárez and Portal del Diezmo.]]
At the beginning of the eighteenth century, at the behest of the Vice royal government the bridge was again rebuilt, resulting in a much stronger and more colorful bridge than the previous two: built on five arches and quarry plates that to date remain in place.  This bridge was completed on 23 January 1722 in the rule of the Duke of Linares.

In addition to this relevant urban element, churches, temples, and convents began to gain ground with their respective ideological influence. The old town of San Juan del Río is similar to that of Querétaro, in which two types of route were included, the irregular trace that is supposed to be the ancient indigenous area where the temple for indigenous people of Calvary was built (named for sinuousness and pen tooth of the ground where it is nestled). The other street layout coincides with the Spanish practice of that time "a cordel", whose urban element and union was the temple for Spaniards of San Juan Bautista. Both buildings were attached camposantos, the first one still retains the original name of Santa Veracruz. In 1670 the first school of letters for girls was formalized, receiving the name "Beaterio de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores", founded by the Third Sisters of the Order of San Francisco, which in 1683 was reorganized by the venerable dray Antonio Margil of Jesus, of whom an interesting legend is told. In 1672, the Hospital and Convent of San Juan de Dios were founded, for the care of the sick in the city and the visitors who stopped in its path, today this building is occupied worthily by the Autonomous University of Querétaro. In 1693 the construction of a new parish church began, which was consecrated on July 25, 1729, and dedicated to the patron saint of the city, St. John the Baptist. On the same dates the construction of the temple and convent of Santo Domingo was completed; the aforementioned convent is located on the main street of San Juan del Río, at the entrance of the royal road (at the current crossroads of Juárez and Zaragoza avenues). Its facade is a quarry, adorned with three shields: La Merced, San Francisco, and Santo Domingo.

On April 3, 1847, and in the context of the war between Mexico and the United States of America, the state government granted the then Villa of San Juan del Río the title of city.

By 1855, industry and trade had a major boost. Among the most important establishments and companies of the time were: barbershops, carpentry, rocket shops, tanneries, breweries, blacksmiths, wheat mills, soap pailas, cotton trapiches, bakeries, silverware, painting workshops, tailors, hat shops, woodworking, wool and blanket looms, battering shops, shoe shops, and futsalstores.

In 1863, [Benito Juarez], on his escape to San Luis Potosí, he stayed overnight in San Juan del Río and, in 1867, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] launched one of his last proclamations in this city, in which he exhorted the people to defend "the Independence and the internal order of the country". Later, on the hill of the Bells of the city of Querétaro was shot along with Generals Miramón and Mejía.
"Contemporary Time"
In the last decade of the nineteenth century, San Juan del Río participated in the railway development by laying the track of the Mexican National Railway and, years later, when the "Round House" for the repair of steam engines was located in this city.

During the period 1960–1970, San Juan del Río began its urban, economic and social transformation of the strong impetus given to the industrializing, commercial and communications process; factors that have currently placed this municipality as the second in importance in the State of Querétaro.<ref>-quote news-name-history-surname-San Juan del Río-title-Encyclopedia of Municipalities of Mexico-http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/EMM22queretaro/municipios/22016a.html editorial-Municipalities of Querétaro.-{{dead link|date=June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15673600/sistercity-1969/|title=Chinoans visit their sister city--San Juan del Rio; Progress highly visible in centuries-old Mexican city|date=August 20, 1969|work=Chino (California) Champion|access-date=July 11, 2022|page=3|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

==Shield==
On June 24, 1984, the Honorable City Council of San Juan del Río headed by the engineer Leopoldo Peralta Navarrete, in The Solemn Session of Cabildo declares the new Official Shield. The result of the design was a call that was launched for this purpose of which the painter Héctor Raúl Rojas López was the winner who, in that same session, was named The Favorite Son of San Juan del Río.
This shield is composed of a traditional coat of arms accompanied by a pair of headbands that descend from the top and join at the lower central. The coat of arms of San Juan del Río is a composite, Spanish-style one, which as well as Portuguese and [[Flanders-flamenco]] (countries that received Spanish influx) is rounded at the base in the shape of an inverted half-point arch.

The blasón is divided into three barracks that contain representative aspects of the municipality: in the upper middle is located the image of the Patron Saint John the Baptist represented in half body; then, symbolizing the historical future, there is the bridge of five arches: the great stone bridge, representing the foundation, evangelization, and development during the viceroyalty.

The lower environment is divided, in turn, into two barracks that represent the moment before evangelization: to the sinister is located the Otomi rode that symbolizes our pre-Hispanic roots when the Spaniards arrived in Iztacchichimecapan (ancient name of San Juan del Río) to conquest. On the right hand, the kingdom of Spain is represented as the meaning of those who founded the people. In the lower part of the blasón is located a gallardete that bears the name of the municipality: San Juan del Río.

The author of the shield took elements of the heraldry for its creation, including as the basis of the composition the representative Stone Bridge, above it the image of the patron Saint John the Baptist -remembering the date of June 24, 1531, the day of St. John the Baptist when it occurred, according to legend, the Spanish foundation of San Juan del Río- and the representation of the Kingdom of Spain in its characteristic colors with the towers of the Kingdom of Castile and the rampant lions of the Kingdom of León, which are already unified here
This is the original colored shield in a stylized design. It is the original work of the author. The enamels (colors) it integrates are: metal: [[Gold (heraldic)-gold]]; and five enamels: [[gules]] (red), [[Azure (color)|azure]] (blue), [[Sable (color)|sable]] (black), [[Sinople (heraldry)|sinople]] (green), griffon (brown) and carnation (meat).

== Puente de la Historia (Bridge of History) ==
The stone bridge construction started on 9 February 1710 by the Mexican architect Pedro de Arrieta. The bridge was completed on 23 January 1711 and soon became the most transited bridge in Mexico as it was the main connection between [[Mexico City]] and the northern states.

The bridge has greater historical importance as it was the main way to get to Mexico City for all of those who fought during the [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican Independence]] and [[Mexican Revolution]].
==Geography==
[[File:Panoramica San Juan.jpg|thumb|Partial view of the city from the hill of sale]]

The city is located in a central sedimentary valley of a rich agricultural area with abundant underground streams of hot springs of about 37.5&nbsp;O.

The valley of San Juan is surrounded by the mountains of La Llave (2,450 [msnm]) of Xajay (2,750 meters above sea level) of Scholastics (2,800 meters above sea level) and Jingó (2,500 meters above sea level).

The San Juan River, whose sources are located in the [[State of Mexico]], is the mainstream of the municipality and the state. This river, when leaving the municipality of [[Tequisquiapan]], already with the name of [[Río Moctezuma]] forms the natural boundary between the states of [[State of Querétaro|Querétaro]] and [[State of Hidalgo|Hidalgo]] and already flows as [[Rio Pánuco]] into the [[Golfo de México]] in the port of [[Tampico]].

===Climate===
San Juan del Río has a semi-dry temperate climate, the rains fall mainly in the summer. Snow is rare in this area, although the hills northeast of the city have been covered with a light white layer.<ref>Inegi.

===Flora===

The flora in San Juan del Río, being in a general study, accommodates the flora "Mezquital", of the regions between 1,400 and 2,000 meters above sea level. However, by specializing in the study, we can say that there is a flora amplitude.
The "Mezquital" area is composed of small trees and large shrubs, such as mesquite, piru or pirul, gobystick, cat's claw, reed, huisache, garambullo, granjeno, and nopal; also the desert-type plants, such as the biznaga and organs.

Both the SESEQ General Hospital and the IMSS Zone Hospital provide 2nd level medical care, although the former General Hospital (SESEQ) in recent years highlighted the entire State of Querétaro by winning the National Quality Award; in addition to the population of the municipality itself, that of the surrounding municipalities, including the states of [[State of Hidalgo] Hidalgo]], [[State of Mexico] Mexico]] and [[Michoacán]], serving more than 500,000 inhabitants, so in some cases the service is insufficient. Emergency services are mainly served by the Mexican Red Cross delegation San Juan del Río, and there are several support groups such as the National Emergency Commission, Volunteer Firefighters, and BEYEN Ambulances, who have a history of 36 years of service and experience in different types of emergencies as well as vehicle rescue, room house fires, accidents in which hazardous materials are involved, among others.

After the catastrophe recorded on September 19, 2010, where the former General Hospital was flooded, a great effort was begun to build a new general hospital. With the help of federal and state financial contributions within a period of approximately one year, the work was completed. On February 21, 2012, the universal coverage plate of popular insurance was unveiled, days after the inauguration of this San Juan del Río General Hospital, with the presence of the President of the Republic Felipe Calderón Hinojosa and in the company of Governor José Calzada. The hospital currently has a wide variety of specialties, as well as the highest technology equipment and extensive facilities and enough to provide the health service to the entire population that requires it.

Because of its geographical location, it was an obligatory step for the arriería and carriages that went to the North and West of New Spain. From the mid-17th century, it was called "Garganta de Tierra Dentro". It was forced to be a customs stop where the alcabalas of all kinds of goods were collected, especially the brandy, which was severely inspected. The great avenues of the river were the cause of complaints from the owners of recuas, as well as from merchants and travelers, who made it impossible for them to follow their path as long as the river did not go down, being forced to spend several days in the village, with the consequent expenses Unforeseen. Ruled New Spain Don Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, Duke of Albuquerque, Marquis de Cuéllar, who took into his hands this serious problem. He ordered the Spanish architect Pedro de Arrieta, the construction of a bridge for San Juan del Río, whose construction began on February 9, 1710, and was completed on January 23, 1711, Governing the New Spain Don Fernando de Alencastre Noroña and Silva Duque de Linares Marqués V alfuentesfuentes.

He had his pantheon towards the Westeros, in what is now Founder's Square. In the next century and towards the end of it, the church was asked to throw away, and it was not until the early 1700s, that it was torn down to its foundations; because it was small and built with the land. The priest Don Esteban García Rebollo, who did not tolerate racial discrimination, since it was called Parish of the Naturals, consecrated him with the name of the Temple of the Sacred Heart, in 2006 he became the Parish of San Juan Bautista.

Events

St. John the Baptist's Feasts
San Juan del Río was named after its founders arriving at the place on June 24, the day of San Juan, only because it stood on the bank of a flowing river, the "Del Rio" was also applied.

Over the years, these festivities were gaining importance, both because of the influence of religion, as well as for the growth of the city's population and nearby communities.

The festivities of San Juan have not always been celebrated in the month of June, since in a copy of the ''Shadow of Arteaga'' dated December 21, 1878, it tells us that the festivities that took place in the city that year, began on December 11 and concluded on the 14th of the same month, being prefect of the district Mr. J. Jesús Dominguez, and it seems that one of the main organizers was Dr. Agustín Ruiz Olloqui.

It was until the year 1891, when Mr. T. Melesio Alcántara, local deputy for San Juan del Río, organized in a more formal way the festivities of San Juan, requesting the State Legislature to correspond the permission for the realization of our festivities.
The first fair program was contemplated the celebration of cockfights and bullfights, which since that time have allowed our parties, increasingly to enhance. Likewise, the charreadas were an important part of the same festivities because the Association of Charros Sanjuanense was the second to be formed in the Republic, to be exact in 1912.

The festivities of San Juan, have been suspended very rarely, as was during the Revolution in 1911, in 1917 for security reasons, in 1918 on the occasion of an epidemic of Spanish influence, and more recently in 1967.

In 1928, on the occasion of the patron saint festivities, the Bullring, Rodolfo Gaona, built by the Municipal President, Don José Serrano, was inaugurated. During the following years, the festivities continued to develop in the city center, including the dances of the coronation of the Queen in the Hall of Cabildo of the Municipal Presidency.

By 1962, at the initiative of Don José Manuel Layseca Bermúdez and Don Francisco Salas, the celebration began within our festivities, the day of the peasant, and the choice of the Most Beautiful Flower of the Field was held for the first time.

Special mention deserves the year of 1965, in which the first Floral Games are held, being Municipal President the Lic. Manuel Suárez Muñoz, in which the Poet Ernesto Moreno Madruca triumphed, with the composition "To invoke your love", receiving the Flower A native of S.G.M. Mary Cruz I and serving as a maintainer by Mr. Manuel Montes Collantes, with this began the most important cultural event of the city, which would gather throughout its trajectory, the most recognized poets and writers, national, queretanos and SanJuanenses, highlighting among the latter Don Pablo Cabrera.

From 1971, the fair was installed outside the city center and there were different associations of SanJuanens such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Lions Club, who organized the festivities on different dates. In the 1980s the fair center was located in the facilities of the Cultural and Convention Center ''José María Morelos (CECUCO)', located to the south-east of the city, later in 2004 the Expositor Center is inaugurated, located in the [Road[Road 120th Road] from San Juan del Río to [[Xilitla]].

Currently, the fair of San Juan del Río has great recognition at the state and national level, standing out for its great organization and quality of programs, as well as for its Livestock, Commercial and Industrial Exhibitions. It also stands out for a large number of cultural events that have given it momentum in recent years.

Others of the few events that are particular of San Juan del Río is the pilgrimage of Farolitos that takes place every December 11.

===Procession of the Phallodes===

The procession of the Phallolitus is a San Juan tradition that takes place every year on December 11 to start the festivities of the Virgin of Guadalupe in San Juan del Río. Its beginnings date back to 1948. 
The idea was born in the mind of Father Manuel Pérez Esquivel. This idea was well accepted by Father Francisco Paulin Gómez who was the city's pastor. 
This is one of the most important religious events in San Juan del Río in the last century. In this procession more than 5 thousand people have been gathered representatives of various institutions such as parish associations, schools, municipal authorities, among others, to illuminate Juarez Avenue with its thousands of farolitos until reaching the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.
Initially, the pilgrimage began in the Hacienda de la Venta until reaching the old parish; the forerunners of this tradition carried candles and torches, presently carrying paper phallolites or celopán. From about 1980 on, the pilgrimage begins in the Temple of St. John of God and concludes in the Parish Atrium, where the mass of the celebration is held.
Those who participate in the celebration claim that it means the pilgrim of life, dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe and the phallolites represent the faith towards the virgin. In recent years, the children dress as little shepherds in honor of Juan Diego who had the privilege of seeing the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Thus, every December 11 the city is illuminated and the prayers of the faithful to the Queen of Tepeyac rise.
