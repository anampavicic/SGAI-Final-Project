'''Jinzhou''' ({{IPAc-en|'|dʒ|ɪ|n|'|dʒ|oʊ}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Jinzhou pronunciation|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jinzhou|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=25 April 2015}}</ref> {{zh|s={{linktext|锦|州}} |t=錦州 |p=Jǐnzhōu}}), [[Postal Romanization|formerly]] '''Chinchow''', is a coastal [[prefecture-level city]] in central-west [[Liaoning province]], China. It is a geographically strategic city located in the [[Liaoxi Corridor]], which connects most of the [[land transport]]s between [[North China]] and [[Northeast China]], and is the economic center of western Liaoning.  Located on the northern shore of [[Liaodong Bay]], Jinzhou encompasses a coastline of {{convert|97.7|km|abbr=on}}, with the [[Port of Jinzhou]] being China's northernmost seaport.

It is the fifth-most populous city in Liaoning, with a population of 2,703,853 (2020 census), of whom 1,524,362 reside in the built-up (or metro) area encompassing the 3 urban [[district (China)|urban district]]s and Linghai City largely being conurbated. The total area under the jurisdiction of Jinzhou is {{convert|9989|km2|sp=us}}, most of which is rural.

==History==
[[File:Txu-oclc-6614368-nk51-7.jpg|thumb|left|Map including Jinzhou (labeled as CHIN-HSIEN {{lang|zh-hant|錦縣}}) ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1950)]]
Jinzhou is an ancient city with over a thousand years of history. Originally known as '''Tuhe''' ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|徒河}}}}), it was part of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] in the [[Warring States period]]. Under the [[Qin dynasty]], the majority of what is now Jinzhou became part of [[Liaodong Commandery]]. It was part of [[Changli Commandery]] in the province of [[Youzhou]] during the [[Han dynasty]] and [[Three Kingdoms period]]s, but fell under the jurisdiction of Yingzhou in the [[Northern Wei|Beiwei]], [[Dongwei]], and [[Northern Qi|Beiqi]] periods, before becoming part of [[Liucheng Commandery]] and then [[Yan Prefecture]] during the [[Sui dynasty]] and [[Tang dynasty]]. During the Tang, it was the seat of the [[Andong Protectorate]].

The name "Jinzhou" came into use in the [[Liao dynasty]], when it belonged to [[Zhongjing prefecture]]. In the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], it was part of [[Dongjing Prefecture]] and Beijing Prefecture. It belonged to Liaoyang Xingzhongshu in the [[Mongol Empire]]/[[Yuan dynasty]] and to Liaodong township in the [[Ming dynasty]]. It was ruled by Tianfu during the [[Qing dynasty]], when its name was changed from Jinzhou to '''Jinxian'''. It is also known in English as '''Chinhsien''' and '''Chinchow'''.

[[File:Final Attack on Jinzhou.jpg|thumb|left|[[People's Liberation Army]] launches final strike on Jinzhou]]
During the [[Republic of China (1911-1949)|Republican period]], Jinzhou was attached to [[Liaoning]] Province. When the [[Chinese Civil War]] resumed in 1945, Jinzhou was the site of a major battle between the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] and [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] forces, since it is where the main route from [[Manchuria]] through [[Shanhai Pass]] enters central China. Its capture on 22 November 1945, by Nationalist forces under [[Du Yuming]] forced the Communists to agree to a temporary ceasefire that lasted several months.<ref>Lew, Christopher R. ''The Third Chinese Revolutionary War, 1945-1949: An Analysis of Communist Strategy and Leadership''. The USA and Canada: Routelage. 2009. {{ISBN|0-415-77730-5}}. pp.28-30</ref>

During the [[Liaoshen campaign]], in which the [[People's Liberation Army]] began to consolidate control of [[Northeast China]], refugees tried to escape to the city to flee further south. The [[Republic of China Army]], under orders from [[Chiang Kai-shek]] not to allow refugees to escape the region, shot at them as they tried to cross the [[Daling River]] 30 kilometers north of the city. The Communists commanded by [[Lin Biao]] captured the city in September 1948.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dikötter |first=Frank. |title=The Tragedy of Liberation: A History of the Chinese Revolution, 1945-1957 |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-62040-347-1 |edition=1 |location=London |pages=21}}</ref>

After the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment of the People's Republic of China]] in 1949, [[Liaoxi Province]] was founded and Jinzhou became its provincial capital.  Jinzhou came back under the administration of Liaoning Province in 1954, when Liaoxi and Liaodong provinces re-merged.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Du |first=Wenwen |date=15 October 2020 |title=战史今日10月15日：解放军攻克锦州 |trans-title=en:War History Today, October 15: PLA Takes Jinzhou |url=http://www.81.cn/js_208592/9919031.html |access-date=22 March 2024 |website=zh:中国军网 |language=zh |quote=”锦州战役是国共内战中中国人民解放军与国民党军之间的一场战役，它是在东北的其中一场决定性战役，是辽沈战役的一个组成部分。“}}</ref>

== Geography and climate==

Jinzhou is located in the southwestern portion of Liaoning, and borders [[Panjin]], [[Anshan City|Anshan]], and [[Shenyang]] to the east, and [[Huludao]] on the west. The city's southern coast is the [[Liaodong Bay]]. On the north are [[Chaoyang City|Chaoyang]] and [[Fuxin]].

Jinzhou has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''), with four distinct seasons; winters are cold but very dry while summers are hot and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−7.9|°C|1}} to {{convert|24.3|°C|1}} in July, with the annual mean being {{convert|9.50|°C|1}}. The annual average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is between {{convert|540|and|640|mm|in|0|sp=us}}, the majority of which usually occurs in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45% in July to 68% in three months, the city receives 2,682 hours of bright sunshine annually, with autumn and winter being especially sunny.

Fossil-bearing rocks are exposed in the city's vicinity, including the [[Yixian Formation]]. A [[genus]] of [[Early Cretaceous]] birds has been named ''[[Jinzhouornis]]'' in honor of the locality, but it appears to be a [[junior synonym]] of ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' which was found in the same [[formation (geology)|formation]] some years earlier.

[[Jinzhou Jinzhouwan Airport]] provides air transport to major airports in China.  There are two railway stations in the city, one designated for long trips and one for shorter routes.  The most popular way to get around Jinzhou is on foot or by bicycle.  Taxis crowd the streets and start at 6 [[RMB]] per trip.  Bus routes also blanket the city and provide the most economical means of transportation, but are not always reliable.

== Military ==
Jinzhou is headquarters of the [[40th Army (People's Republic of China)|40th Group Army]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]], one of the three group armies that comprise the [[Shenyang Military Region]] responsible for defending China's northeastern borders with [[Russia]] and [[North Korea]].

== Tourism ==

The [[Liaoshen Campaign Memorial]] ({{zh|s=辽沈战役纪念馆|t=遼沈戰役紀念館|first=t}}) commemorates the [[Liaoshen Campaign]] of 1948. It is a large museum that holds and displays over 16,000 pieces of equipment used during the campaign, including rifles, machine guns, mortars, cannons, and tanks.  It also holds thousands of pictures and documents.  The best known exhibit inside the museum is the Panoramic Picture Hall, which reproduces the complete Battle of Jinzhou on a rotating circular screen.

[[Yiwulü Mountain]] is located in the west of Beizhen City of Jinzhou. It is one of the three sacred mountains in Northeast China.  Wanghai Mountain is the main peak, with a height of 867 meters above the sea level, and tourist spots such as Beizhen Temple, Shenshui Bridge, Fish Pool, Guanyin Pavilion, Sijiao Pavilion, Kuangguang Pavilion, Lotus Stone, Cloud Pass and Wanghai Temple are scattered throughout the mountain range.

[[Mount Bijia]] is an island in the Bohai Sea south of Jinzhou on which is located a [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] temple. During most of the day, Mount Bijia can only be accessed by boat, but when the tide wanes, a natural causeway connects Mount Bijia to the mainland. People can walk to Mount Bijia from the seafront on foot and local people have named this natural wonder ''Tian Qiao'', (''lit'': Sky Bridge). On the top of the mountain there is a tall stone pavilion, which resembles a gigantic pen resting on a pen holder, hence the name "Bijiashan", meaning the "Pen Holder Mountain".
