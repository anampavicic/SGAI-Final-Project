'''Curitiba''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|kuɾiˈtʃibɐ|lang}}) is the capital and largest city in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] in Southern [[Brazil]]. The city's population was 1,773,718 {{As of|2022|lc=y}}, making it the [[List of cities in Brazil by population|eighth most populous city in Brazil]] and the largest in Brazil's [[South Region, Brazil|South Region]].<ref name=pano/> The Curitiba [[Metropolitan area]] comprises 29 [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] with a total population of over 3,559,366,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-28 |title=Região Metropolitana de Curitiba cresce 10% em 12 anos, indica Censo |url=https://g1.globo.com/pr/parana/noticia/2023/06/28/regiao-metropolitana-de-curitiba-cresceu-10percent-em-12-anos-indica-censo.ghtml |access-date=2024-06-25 |website=G1 |language=pt-br}}</ref> making it the ninth most populous metropolitan area in the country.

The city sits on a [[plateau]] at {{cvt|932|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It is located west of the seaport of [[Paranaguá]] and is served by the [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Afonso Pena International]] and [[Bacacheri Airport|Bacacheri]] airports.

In the 19th century, Curitiba's favorable location between cattle-breeding countryside and marketplaces led to a successful cattle trade and the city's first major expansion. Later, between 1850 and 1950, it grew due to [[logging]] and [[agricultural expansion]] in Paraná State (first [[Araucaria angustifolia]] logging, later [[mate (beverage)|mate]] and coffee cultivation and in the 1970s wheat, corn and [[soybean]] cultivation). In the 1850s, waves of [[European Brazilian|European immigrants]] arrived in Curitiba, mainly [[German Brazilian|Germans]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]], [[Polish Brazilian|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukrainians]], contributing to the city's economic and cultural development and richness in diversity.<ref name="curitiba-parana">{{cite web |url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/tradicoes.htm |title=Tradições Culturais |publisher=Curitiba-parana.net|access-date=7 March 2011 |language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211165316/http://www.curitiba-parana.net/tradicoes.htm|archive-date=11 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Nowadays, only small numbers of immigrants arrive, primarily from [[Middle East]]ern<ref name="paimeas">{{cite web |title=A imigração árabe muçulmana em Curitiba |publisher=Etni-cidade |language=pt |access-date=3 October 2008 |url=http://www.etni-cidade.net/2008/a_imigracao_arabe.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205114702/http://www.etni-cidade.net/2008/a_imigracao_arabe.htm |archive-date=5 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and other South American countries.

==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Curitiba}}

One theory is that the name ''Curitiba'' comes from the [[Tupi language|Tupi]] words ''kurí tyba'' 'many araucária seeds' due to the large number of [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paraná pines]] pinecones in the region prior to its founding.<ref name=autogenerated2>Fenianos, E. (2003) ''Almanaque Kur'yt'yba'', Curitiba: Univer Cidade, p.6</ref>

Another version, also using words from the Tupi language, is that it originates in the combination of ''kurit'' 'pine tree' and ''yba'' 'large amount'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inf.ufpr.br/sibgrapi2004/site.html |title=Curitiba name origin |publisher=Inf.ufpr.br |date=20 October 2004 |access-date=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162138/http://www.inf.ufpr.br/sibgrapi2004/site.html |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Portuguese, who founded a settlement on the site in 1693, named it ''Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais'' 'Village of Our Lady of the Light of the Pines'.

The name was changed to ''Curitiba'' in 1721. Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, spelling its name ''Curityba''.

An alternative spelling was ''Coritiba''. This was used in press and state documents. A state decree in 1919 settled the dispute by adopting ''Curitiba''.<ref name=autogenerated2/>

==History==

[[File:Mapa Curitiba 1894 CR493.jpg|thumb|left|Curitiba in 1894 (Portuguese edition)]]

At the end of the 17th century, Curitiba's agriculture was only for subsistence and its main economic activities were mineral extraction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/conteudo/perfil-da-cidade-de-curitiba/174 |title=History of Curitiba |access-date=20 May 2022 |archive-date=28 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220528194039/https://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/conteudo/perfil-da-cidade-de-curitiba/174 |url-status=live }}</ref> Waves of European immigrants arrived after 1850, mainly Poles, Italians, Germans (mostly Volga Germans from Russia) and Ukrainians.<ref name="curitiba-parana"/>

The [[Paranaguá]]–Curitiba railroad was opened in 1885.<ref name="pr2"/>

Around the beginning of the 20th century, Curitiba benefited from the wealth of the [[yerba mate]] mills. The owners (known as ''"barões da erva-mate"'') built mansions in the capital. These have mostly been preserved in the districts of Batel and Alto da Glória.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/haus/estilo-cultura/as-casas-dos-baroes-curitibanos/ |title=Palacetes suntuosos do início do século foram inspirados em referências trazidas pelos ervateiros de suas viagens à Europa |date=2015-11-03 |work=[[Gazeta do Povo]] |publisher=grp.com|access-date=2018-05-21 |language=pt-BR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412224516/http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/haus/estilo-cultura/as-casas-dos-baroes-curitibanos/|archive-date=12 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]], co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce its first [[city plan]]. It emphasized a "star" of [[boulevard]]s, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed in part, but the plan was too expensive to complete.<ref name="agac">{{cite web |title=The Agache Plan |publisher=Prefeitura Municipal de Curitiba|access-date=12 August 2008 |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/Paginas/ENG/Default.aspx?idf=532&servico=40}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Curitiba has a long history of being intentional about city planning. The early leaders in Curitiba were the first people to establish building regulations. This included limiting the number of trees cut and requiring homes to have tile and not wood roofs. By 1960 Curitiba’s population had increased to 430,000 and Alfred Agache's plan for the city had not considered the future influx of immigrants. A group of young planners and architects led by Jamie Lerner from the Federal University of Paraná answered a proposal from Mayor Ivo Arzua centered around preparing Curitiba for new growth. They improved Agache’s plan by proposing adding major linear transit pathways to Curitiba to provide straightforward high-speed routes throughout the city. They also included plans for reducing downtown traffic, minimizing urban sprawl, providing easily accessible and inexpensive public transit, and preserving Curitiba’s historic district. This intelligent and well-thought-out proposal was adopted and became the Curitiba Master Plan. Jamie Lerner went on to create the city's first urban planning department in order to facilitate further redevelopment efforts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FRONTLINE/WORLD Fellows .

==Geography==
Curitiba, the capital of the [[Paraná state]] of southern [[Brazil]], is located near the Atlantic margin of the [[Brazilian Highlands]] and the headwaters of the Iguaçu River. It is around 3,050 feet (930 meters) above sea level.

===Climate===
[[File:AmorMaternoJBCuritiba.JPG|thumb|Fog in the [[Botanical Garden of Curitiba|Botanical Garden]]]]

Curitiba has a typically humid [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb)''. The city's somewhat mild winters, due to its low latitude, differentiate its climate from typically [[Temperate climate|temperate]] ones.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=4838&cityname=Curitiba-Parana-Brazil |title=Curitiba, Parana Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase) |website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201013639/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=4838&cityname=Curitiba-Parana-Brazil|archive-date=1 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The terrain's flatness hinders water drainage after rain, therefore providing water vapor for the atmosphere. Cold fronts come year round, often from [[Antarctica]] and [[Argentina]], bringing tropical storms in summer and cold winds and frost in the winter. They can move very quickly, with no more than one day between the start of the southern winds and the start of rain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bemparana.com.br/index.php?n=75493&t=frente-fria-traz-chuva-ao-parana-e-aumenta-taxas-de-umidade |title=Frente fria traz chuva ao Paraná e aumenta taxas de umidade |publisher=Bemparana.com.br |access-date=7 March 2011 |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151735/http://www.bemparana.com.br/index.php?n=75493&t=frente-fria-traz-chuva-ao-parana-e-aumenta-taxas-de-umidade |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Curitiba's weather is also influenced by the dry air masses that dominate Brazil's midwest most of the year, bringing hot and dry weather, sometimes even in winter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/vidaecidadania/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&id=778839&tit=Inverno-vai-ser-mais-seco-e-mais-frio-que-o-do-ano-passado |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731124345/http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/vidaecidadania/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&id=778839&tit=Inverno-vai-ser-mais-seco-e-mais-frio-que-o-do-ano-passado |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Winter of Curitiba is dry and cold |publisher=Portal.rpc.com.br |access-date=7 March 2011}}</ref>

===Vegetation===
[[File:CuritibaGeadaFrost.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frost]] in Curitiba]]
[[File:Jardim Botânico Centro Curitiba.jpg|thumb|Botanical gardens greenhouse in Curitiba]]

Curitiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as [[Araucaria moist forests]]), a sub-type of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paraná (or Brazilian) pine (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]''), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paraná pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a [[botanical garden]] and three [[greenhouse]]s that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings.<ref name="casecwb">{{cite web |title=City of Curitiba, Brazil |publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity |access-date=23 May 2008 |url=http://www.cbd.int/authorities/casestudy/curitiba.}} {{Dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>

Curitiba's green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow ''ipês'' ([[tabebuia]]s), who flower at the end of winter. The yellow ipê is one of the city's most common tree.<ref name="arvct">{{cite web |title=Livro mostra roteiros das árvores de Curitiba/Pr |publisher=Ambiente Brasil |language=pt |access-date=25 May 2005 |url=http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&id=18883 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019045953/http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&id=18883 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 October 2015}}</ref>

===Hydrography===
[[File:Rio iguaçu curitiba.jpg|thumb|Iguaçu River, running by the south region of the city]]

The [[drainage basin|catchment area]] of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city's [[Drainage basin|watershed]] are: Atuba River, Belém River, Barigüi River, Passaúna River, Ribeirão dos Padilhas and the [[Iguaçu River]], all with characteristics of [[dendritic drainage]]. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of [[wikt:urbanization|urbanization]] on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods.<ref name="casecwb"/>
After many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a [[Canalized|canalization]] process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.<ref name="casecwb"/>

===Topography===
[[File:Curitiba vista serra do mar.jpg|thumb|left|The Mountain Range of the Sea, ''"Serra do Mar"'']]

The city covers {{cvt|432.17|km2|2}} on the First Plateau of Paraná. Curitiba has a [[topography]] of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of {{cvt|934.6|m|ft}} above sea level. The highest point is to the north at {{cvt|1021|m|ft}}, and with lower altitudes at {{cvt|864|m|ft}} to the south.

Mountain ranges and sets of rocky hills surround parts of the city, including the ''[[Serra do Mar]]'', a hill range between the shore of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the First Plateau in Paraná.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.infoescola.com/geografia/relevo-do-parana/ |title=Serra do Mar in Paraná state |access-date=24 March 2022 |archive-date=10 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221010152153/https://www.infoescola.com/geografia/relevo-do-parana/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Palácio 29 de Março Curitiba Paraná Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|The Curitiba City Hall]]

{{As of|2017}}, the mayor is [[Rafael Greca]], who replaced Gustavo Fruet. The [[City Council]] of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to [[subprefecture]]), who manage the municipality's 75 districts. The ''Rua da Cidadania'' ("Street of Citizenship") is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals.

[[Jaime Lerner]] is perhaps Curitiba's best-known mayor. He was the mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; built a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works similarly to a light rail system; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html |title=Sitemap – ダポキセチンで早漏改善！ |website=Citiesforpeople.net|access-date=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312113008/http://citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As with most of [[Southern Brazil]]'s population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by European descendants. The first Europeans to arrive were of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] origin, during the 17th century. They [[interracial marriage|intermarried]] with the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|native people]] and with the African [[slave]]s.<ref name="pr">{{cite web |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/pmc/curitiba/index.asp?noframe=sim&conteudo=imigra/index.html |title=Imigração |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703141121/http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/pmc/curitiba/index.asp?noframe=sim&conteudo=imigra%2Findex.html |archive-date=3 July 2007 |date=3 July 2007 |access-date=16 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Up until the 19th century, the inhabitants of the city of Curitiba were natives and mixed-race, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants. In 1808 foreigners were granted the right to ownership of land, and in 1853 Parana became an independent province, and these events resulted in a substantial number of immigrants from Europe.<ref name="pr2"/>

The first non-[[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] (Portuguese and Spaniard) immigrants to come to the city were [[German Brazilian|German]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/curitibano |title=The 'Curitibano |publisher=Prefeitura de Curitiba|access-date=19 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323164759/http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/curitibano|archive-date=23 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Memorial of Polish Immigration was inaugurated on 13 December 1980, after the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] in June. Its area is {{cvt|46000|m2}} and was part of the former Candles plant. The seven wooden log houses are parts of this memorial area, as a memento of the Polish immigrants' struggles and faith. Objects like an old wagon, pipe of cabbage and a print of the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] (patron saint of the [[Polish people]]), form parts of the memorial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parques-curitiba.com/bosque-papa-joao-paulo.htm |title=Polish Memorial of Curitiba |publisher=Parques-curitiba.com|access-date=7 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715044611/http://www.parques-curitiba.com/bosque-papa-joao-paulo.htm|archive-date=15 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first group of Poles arrived in Curitiba around 1871. Curitiba has the biggest colony of Polish immigrants in Brazil.

[[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]] started arriving in Brazil in 1875 and in Curitiba in 1878, coming mainly from the [[Veneto]] and [[Trento]] regions of [[Northern Italy]]. They settled mostly in the [[Santa Felicidade neighborhood]], still a centre of the Italian community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/italianos.htm |title=Imigração e Cultura Italiana |publisher=Curitiba-parana.net |access-date=7 March 2011 |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501092246/http://www.curitiba-parana.net/italianos.htm |archive-date=1 May 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Nearly 20,000 [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukrainian]] immigrants settled there between 1895 and 1897, consisting mostly of peasants from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] who immigrated to Brazil to become farmers.

[[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] immigrants began arriving in 1915, with a larger contingent arriving in 1924. Curitiba received a significant Japanese influx. They settled mostly between Paraná and São Paulo state. The city has the second largest Japanese community in Brazil, behind only São Paulo, according to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]. Although both cities have around the same proportion of Japanese descendants, other large cities in the interior of the state of Paraná, such as Maringá and Londrina, have an even higher rate. Some estimates suggest that more than 40,000 Japanese-Brazilians live in Curitiba.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/japao.htm |title=Japan Square in Curitiba |publisher=Curitiba-parana.net |access-date=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301095258/http://www.curitiba-parana.net/japao.htm |archive-date=1 March 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1994, tourism generated {{USD|280&nbsp;million}}- 4% of the city's net income. Curitiba has municipal health, education and day care networks, neighborhood libraries shared by schools and citizens and Citizenship Streets, where buildings provide essential public services, sports and cultural facilities near transportation terminals. At the Open University, residents can take courses in subjects such as mechanics, hair styling and environmental protection for a small fee.

==Urban planning==
[[File:Rua 24 horas 2 Curitiba Basil.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance of [[Rua 24 Horas|24 Hours Street]]]]
Curitiba has a planned transportation system, which includes lanes on major streets devoted to a [[bus rapid transit]] system. The buses are split into three sections ([[Bi-articulated bus|bi-articulated]]) and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with access for disabled riders. Buses charge one price regardless of distance.<ref>Jonas Rabinovitch and Josef Leitman, "Urban Planning in Curitiba", ''Scientific American'', vol. 274, no. 3 (March 1996), pp. 46–53</ref>

The city preserves and cares for its green areas, boasting {{cvt|51.5|m2|sqft}} of green space per inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI1926962-EI299,00.html |title=Curitiba busca recuperação de biodiversidade local Terra – Ambiente |publisher=Noticias.terra.com.br|access-date=22 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606025238/http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI1926962-EI299,00.html|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]], cofounder of the [[French Society for Urban Studies]], was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a star of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. The plan was too expensive to complete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/Paginas/ENG/Default.aspx?idf=532&servico=40 |title=Prefeitura ENG |publisher=Curitiba.pr.gov.br |access-date=22 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
[[File:Civic Center, Curitiba.jpg|thumb|Civic Center skyline in Curitiba, with many administrative and commercial buildings]]
By the 1960s, Curitiba's population had reached 430,000. Some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to damage the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect [[Jaime Lerner]], who later became mayor, led a team from the [[Universidade Federal do Paraná]] that suggested strict controls on [[urban sprawl]], reduced traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125170008/http://mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf|url-status=dead|title=About Curitiba|archive-date=25 November 2010|access-date=6 April 2023}}</ref>

This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed [[Rua XV de Novembro|XV de Novembro St.]] to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads. In a number of areas subject to floods, buildings were condemned and the land became parks.<ref>[http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 Parks of Curitiba and floods]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012061522/http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 |date=12 October 2006 }}</ref>

Today, Curitiba is considered one of the world's best examples of urban planning.<ref>Irazábal, Clara Elena (2002) ''Curitiba and Portland: Architecture, City Making, and Urban Governance in the Era of Globalization'', PhD Dissertation in Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, p.112</ref> In June 1996, the chairman of the [[Habitat II]] summit of mayors and urban planners in [[Istanbul]] praised Curitiba as "the most innovative city in the country".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oliveira |first1=Márcio de |title=A trajetória do discurso ambiental em Curitiba (1960-2000) |trans-title=The Path of Environmental Speech in Curitiba (1960–2000) |language=pt |journal=Revista de Sociologia e Política |date=June 2001 |issue=16 |pages=97–106 |doi=10.1590/S0104-44782001000100007 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Public transport===
{{Main|Rede Integrada de Transporte}}
Curitiba's public transportation consists entirely of buses. It opened the world's second [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system, [[Rede Integrada de Transporte]], in 1974.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Keith |title=Putting BRT in Car City, China |url=http://americancity.org/daily/entry/putting-brt-in-car-city-china |newspaper=Next American City |date=23 October 2012|access-date=1 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120900/http://americancity.org/daily/entry/putting-brt-in-car-city-china|archive-date=6 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The popularity of Curitiba's BRT has effected a [[modal shift]] from automobile travel to bus travel. Based on 1991 traveler survey results, it was estimated that the introduction of the BRT had caused a reduction of about 27&nbsp;million auto trips per year, annually saving about 27&nbsp;million liters of fuel. In particular, 28 percent of BRT riders previously traveled by car. Compared to eight other Brazilian cities of its size, Curitiba uses about 30 percent less fuel per capita, resulting in one of the country's lowest rates of ambient air pollution. Some 1,100 buses make 12,500 trips every day, serving more than 1.3&nbsp;million passengers, 50 times the number from 20 years ago. Eighty percent of travelers use the express or direct bus services. Curitibanos spend only about 10 percent of their income on transportation, far below the national average.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Joseph |url=http://www.urbanhabitat.org/node/344 |title=Urban transport of Curitiba |publisher=Urbanhabitat.org |access-date=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223215411/http://urbanhabitat.org/node/344 |archive-date=23 February 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Linha Verde Curitiba BRT 05 2013 Est Marechal Floriano 6547 (crop).jpg|left|thumb|452x452px|The biggest bi-articulated bus in the world operating in the city.]]
Curitiba has in its transport fleet the largest bi-articulated bus in the world, with 28 meters in length and capacity for 250 passengers. The bus operates only with soy-based biofuel, which reduces pollutant emissions by 50%.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-03-29 |title=Curitiba inaugura maior ônibus biarticulado do mundo |url=https://exame.com/brasil/curitiba-inaugura-maior-onibus-biarticulado-do-mundo/ |access-date=2020-10-23 |website=Exame |language=pt-BR |archive-date=26 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026225229/https://exame.com/brasil/curitiba-inaugura-maior-onibus-biarticulado-do-mundo/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Divisao administrativa Curitiba.svg|thumb|180px|Curitiba's neighborhoods and boroughs]]
Most districts of Curitiba were born of colonial groups, formed by families of European immigrants in the second half of the nineteenth century.

The centro (downtown or central business district), where the city was founded, is the most bustling area, housing most of the financial institutions of Curitiba.

''Bairros'' (neighborhoods) of Curitiba define the city's geographical divisions. Administrative powers are not delegated to neighborhoods, although neighborhood associations work to improve their communities.
Curitiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs) covering the 75 neighborhoods.

Civic Center (In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Centro Cívico)'' is where the main government buildings are located. It was the first neighborhood in the municipality of Curitiba, capital of the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. The name means <nowiki>'Center of the Citizen''</nowiki>.

It was conceived in 1953, with the greater independence which came with the creation of a new state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/portugues/linhaturismo/centrocivico |title=Centro Cívico – Prefeitura de Curitiba |last=Curitiba |first=Prefeitura de |website=www.curitiba.pr.gov.br |language=pt-br|access-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225225049/http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/portugues/linhaturismo/centrocivico|archive-date=25 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://partiucuritiba.com/conheca-a-historia-do-centro-civico-de-curitiba/ |title=Conheça a História do Centro Cívico de Curitiba |last=Curitiba |first=Partiu |date=2017-05-26 |website=Partiu Curitiba |language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226035235/http://partiucuritiba.com/conheca-a-historia-do-centro-civico-de-curitiba/|archive-date=26 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
