'''Carinthia''' ({{langx|de|Kärnten}} {{IPA|de|ˈkɛʁntn̩||Kärnten.ogg}}; {{langx|sl|Koroška}} {{IPA|sl|kɔˈɾóːʃka||Koroška.ogg}}; {{langx|it|Carinzia}} {{IPA|it|kaˈrintsja|}}) is the southernmost and least densely populated [[States of Austria|Austrian state]], in the [[Eastern Alps]], and is noted for its mountains and lakes. The main language is [[Austrian German|German]]. Its regional dialects belong to the [[Southern Bavarian]] group. [[Carinthian dialect group|Carinthian Slovene dialects]], forms of a South [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]] that predominated in the southeastern part of the region up to the first half of the 20th century, are now spoken by a [[Carinthian Slovenes|small minority]] in the area.

Carinthia's main [[Industry (economics)|industries]] are [[tourism]], [[electronics]], [[engineering]], [[forestry]], and [[agriculture]].

==Name==
[[File:Heiligenblut am Großglockner (1).JPG|thumb|left|[[Heiligenblut]] with [[Grossglockner]] (snow-covered peak in the central background)]]
The etymology of the name "Carinthia", similar to [[Carnia]] or [[Carniola]], has not been conclusively established. The ''[[Ravenna Cosmography]]'' (about AD&nbsp;700) referred to a [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic]] "Carantani" tribe as the eastern neighbours of the [[Bavarians]]. In his ''[[History of the Lombards]]'', the 8th-century chronicler [[Paul the Deacon]] mentions "Slavs in [[Carnuntum]], which is erroneously called Carantanum" (''Carnuntum, quod corrupte vocitant Carantanum'') for the year 663.<ref>Simoniti Vasko, Štih Peter (1996): ''Slovenska zgodovina do razsvetljenstva''. Celovec, Mohorjeva družba in Korotan.</ref>

"Carantani" may have been formed from a toponymic base ''carant-'' which ultimately derives from pre-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root *''karra'' 'rock'.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home > Carinthia at first sight > History|url=https://www.ktn.gv.at/199410_DE-Carinthia_at_first_sight-History|website=ktn.gv.at |access-date=2015-10-04}}</ref> (cf. {{langx|fur|carantàn}}), or that it is of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin and derived from *''karantos'' 'friend, ally'.

Likewise, the Slovene name {{lang|sla|*korǫtanъ}} may have been adopted from the [[Latin]] *''carantanum''. The toponym ''Carinthia'' (Slovene: {{lang|sl|Koroška}} < [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] ''*korǫt’ьsko'') is also claimed to be etymologically related, deriving from pre-Slavic *''carantia''.<ref>France Bezlaj, ''Etimološki slovar slovenskega jezika'' (''Slovenian [[Etymological dictionary|Etymological Dictionary]]''). Vol. 2: K–O / edited by Bogomil Gerlanc. - 1982. p. 68. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1976–2005.</ref>

Carinthia is known as ''Koruška/ Корушка'' in Croatian and Serbian, ''Korutany'' in Czech, ''Kärnten'' in German, ''Karintia'' in Hungarian, ''Carinzia'' in Italian, ''Carintia'' in Spanish, ''Karyntia'' in Polish, ''Korutánsko'' in Slovak, and ''Koroška'' in Slovene.

==Geography==
[[File:Austria Carinthia relief location map.svg|thumb|Topographic map of Carinthia]]
The state stretches about {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west, and {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a north–south direction. With {{convert|9536|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, it is the fifth-largest Austrian state by area. Most of the larger Carinthian towns and lakes are situated within the Klagenfurt Basin in the southeast, an inner Alpine [[sedimentary basin]] covering about one-fifth of the area. These Lower Carinthian lands differ from the mountainous Upper Carinthian region in the northwest, stretching up to the [[Main chain of the Alps|Alpine crest]].

The Carinthian lands are confined by mountain ranges: the [[Carnic Alps]] and the [[Karawanks]] form the border to Italy ([[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]) and Slovenia ([[Carinthia Statistical Region]], [[Savinja Statistical Region]] and [[Upper Carniola Statistical Region]]). The [[High Tauern]] mountain range with Mt [[Grossglockner]], {{convert|3797|m|ft|abbr=on}}, separates it from the state of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] in the northwest. To the northeast and east beyond the [[Pack Saddle]] mountain pass is the state of [[Styria]]. The main river of Carinthia is the [[Drava]] (''Drau''), it makes up a continuous valley with [[East Tyrol]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] to the west. Tributaries are the [[Gurk River|Gurk]], the [[Glan (Gurk)|Glan]], the [[Lavant River|Lavant]], and the [[Gail River|Gail]] rivers. Carinthia's lakes including [[Wörther See]], [[Millstätter See]], [[Lake Ossiach]], and [[Lake Faak]] are a major tourist attraction.
[[File:Faaker See and Mittagskogel.png|thumb|right|[[Lake Faak]] and the [[Karawanks]]]]
The capital city is [[Klagenfurt]]. The next important town is [[Villach]], both strongly linked economically. Other major towns include [[Althofen]], [[Bad Sankt Leonhard im Lavanttal]], [[Bleiburg]], [[Feldkirchen in Kärnten|Feldkirchen]], [[Ferlach]], [[Friesach]], [[Gmünd, Carinthia|Gmünd]], [[Hermagor-Pressegger See|Hermagor]], [[Radenthein]], [[Sankt Andrä]], [[Sankt Veit an der Glan]], [[Spittal an der Drau]], [[Straßburg, Austria|Straßburg]], [[Völkermarkt]], [[Wolfsberg, Carinthia|Wolfsberg]].

Carinthia has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]), with hot and moderately wet summers and long harsh winters. In recent decades, winters have been exceptionally [[arid]]. The summer [[precipitation]] maxima often takes the form of heavy rain and [[thunderstorm]]s, especially in the mountainous regions. The main Alpine ridge in the north is a meteorological divide with pronounced [[windward and leeward]] sides where [[foehn wind|foehn]] occurs regularly.

Due to the diversified [[terrain]], numerous distinct [[microclimates]] exist. Nevertheless, the average amount of sunshine hours is the highest of all states in Austria. In autumn and winter, temperature [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] often dominates the climate, characterized by air stillness, a dense [[fog]] covering the frosty valleys and trapping pollution to form [[smog]], while mild sunny weather is recorded higher up in the foothills and mountains.

==History==
The settlement history of Carinthia dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] era. Archaeological findings of stone artifacts in a stalactite cave near [[Griffen, Austria|Griffen]] are older than 30,000 years; larger settlements in the [[Lavanttal]], [[Maria Saal]] and [[Villach]] regions are documented from about 3000 BC. Remains of a prehistoric [[stilt house]] settlement were discovered at [[Keutschacher See|Lake Keutschach]], today part of the [[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps]] World Heritage Site. Skeleton finds from about 2000 BC (near [[Friesach]]) denote a permanent population, and intensive arable farming, as well as trading with salt and Mediterranean products, was common already during the periods of the [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield]] and [[Hallstatt culture]]. Hallstatt [[grave field]]s were discovered near [[Dellach]] (Gurina), [[Rosegg]] (Frög), and on the Gracarca mountain southeast of [[Lake Klopein]].

===Noricum===
{{main|Noricum}}
[[File:Anonymous Youth of Magdalensberg 03.JPG|thumb|[[Youth of Magdalensberg]], replica of a Roman bronze statue unearthed near [[Magdalensberg]] (''[[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]'', Vienna)]]About 300 BC, several [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes joined in the [[Kingdom of Noricum]], centered on the capital [[Noreia]], possibly located in the [[Zollfeld]] basin near the later Roman city of [[Virunum]]. Known for the production of salt and iron, the Kingdom maintained intensive trade relations with [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] peoples and over the centuries extended the borders of its realm up to the [[Danube]] in the north. The [[Roman Empire]] incorporated Noricum in 15 BC. Besides the administrative seat of Virunum, the cities of [[Teurnia]], Santicum (Villach) and Iuenna ([[Globasnitz]]) arose as centres of Roman culture. The Noricum [[Roman province|province]] remained strategically important as a mining area for iron, gold, and lead and as an agricultural region. In the reign of the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (245–313) Noricum split into two provinces: ''Noricum ripense'' ("Noricum along the river", the northern part southward from the Danube), and ''Noricum mediterraneum'' ("landlocked Noricum", the district south of the [[Main chain of the Alps|Alpine crest]]). Teurnia became the administrative seat of the latter, as well as an [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] [[episcopal see]].

As the Roman Empire declined in the 5th century AD, the Noricum region was exposed to recurring campaigns of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes, whereupon the population retired to hilltop settlements. In 408 [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] troops under King [[Alaric I]] entered Noricum from Italy across the [[Carnic Alps]] and allied with the Roman commander [[Stilicho]], who as a result was deposed and executed for high treason (August 408). From 472 [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] and [[Alemanni]]c forces campaigned in Noricum, which became a province of [[Odoacer]]'s [[king of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 476 and of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] from 493. On the death of King [[Theoderic the Great]] in 526, the Italian kingdom finally collapsed and the East Roman [[Byzantine]] empire under [[Justinian I]] temporarily conquered the Noricum region in the course of the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]] of 535 to 554.

===Carantania===
{{main|Carantania}}
[[File:Klagenfurt Landhaus Großer Wappensaal Fürstenstein 19072006 6295.jpg|thumb|left|Prince's Stone, exhibited at the ''Landhaus'' Klagenfurt]]
From 591 onwards, the [[Kingdom of the Franks|Frankish]] king [[Theudebert I]] tried to break into the former Noricum region, and [[Bavarians|Bavarian]] settlers entered the area from the [[Puster Valley]] in the west. They were however repulsed by [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic]] tribes, who, beset by [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] horsemen moved into present-day Carinthia from the east. About 600 the Slavic principality of [[Carantania]] arose, stretching along the valleys of the [[Drava]], [[Mur (river)|Mur]] and [[Sava]] rivers. The remaining Celto-Roman population was largely assimilated, jointly challenging Avar and Frankish advance. The name ''Carontani'' was first mentioned about 700; the lands of ''Carantanum'' were documented by the chronicler [[Paul the Deacon]] (d. 799). The principality was again centered on the historic Zollfeld valley, where the [[Prince's Stone]] bears witness to the ritual of the investiture of the Carantanian rulers exclusively in Slovene.

While the Carantanian rulers initially joined the tribal union of [[Samo's Empire]], Prince [[Boruth]] turned to Duke [[Odilo, Duke of Bavaria|Odilo]] of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in around 743 to ask for support against the Avar invaders. Aid was granted, however at the price of Bavarian overlordship. The Carantanian principality became part of the Bavarian [[stem duchy]], while the area was [[Christianisation|Christianised]] for the second time by missionaries from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Salzburg|Salzburg diocese]]. Bishop [[Vergilius of Salzburg|Vergilius]] had Prince Boruth's son Cacatius and his nephew Cheitmar brought up in the Christian faith. In 767, at their request, the bishop sent [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]] to Carantania as a [[vicar]] and had churches built at Teurnia and [[Maria Saal]]. Upon a pagan uprising in 772, the forces of Odilo's son Duke [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|Tassilo III of Bavaria]] again subdued the Carantanian lands.

In 788, Duke Tassilo III was finally deposed by the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]], and his territories were incorporated into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. By the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]], the former Carantanian lands fell to the kingdom of [[East Francia]] ruled by Charlemagne's grandson [[Louis the German]]. The ritual of installation of the Carantanian dukes at the Prince's Stone near Karnburg in Slovenian was preserved until 1414, when [[Ernest, Duke of Austria|Ernest the Iron]] was enthroned as Duke of Carinthia.

===Duchy of Carinthia===
{{see also|March of Carinthia|Duchy of Carinthia}}
The [[March of Carinthia]] arose in 889 from the territory bequeathed by Louis's son [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], king of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] from 865 to 880, to his natural son [[Arnulf of Carinthia]]. Arnulf had already assumed the title of a Carinthian duke in 880 and followed his uncle [[Charles the Fat]] as King of East Francia in 887. The [[Duchy of Carinthia]] was finally split from the vast Bavarian duchy in 976 by [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto&nbsp;II]], having come out victorious from his quarrels with Duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry&nbsp;II the Wrangler]]. Carinthia, therefore, was the first newly created duchy of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and for a short while comprised lands stretching from the [[Adriatic Sea]] almost to the [[Danube]]. In 1040, the [[March of Carniola]] was separated from it, and c.&nbsp;1180 Styria, the Carinthian March, became a duchy in its own right. After the death of Duke [[Henry of Bohemia|Henry&nbsp;VI of Gorizia-Tyrol]] in 1335, Carinthia passed to the Habsburg brothers Albrecht II. and [[Otto, Duke of Austria|Otto&nbsp;IV]], and was ruled by this dynasty until 1918. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Carinthia was incorporated in the [[Austrian Empire]]'s [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849)|Kingdom of Illyria]] which succeeded Napoleon's [[Illyrian Provinces]], but recovered its previous status in 1849 and in 1867 became one of the [[Cisleithania]]n [[crown land]]s of [[Austria-Hungary]].

===Formation of the state===
[[File:Obermillstatt 16 2006.JPG|thumb|[[War memorial]] commemorating soldiers from the village of [[Obermillstatt]] who died in World War I]]
In late 1918, the breakup of the Habsburg monarchy was imminent, and on 21 October 1918 the members of the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]] for the German-speaking territories of Austria met in Vienna to constitute a "Provisional National Council for [[German Austria|German-Austria]]". Before the meeting, the delegates agreed that German-Austria should not include "Yugoslav areas of settlement", which referred to [[Lower Styria]] and the two Slovene-speaking Carinthian valleys south of the [[Karawanken]] range, Seeland (Slovenian: Jezersko) and ''Mießtal'' ([[Meža]] Valley). On 12 Nov. 1918, when the Act concerning the foundation of the State of German-Austria was formally passed by the Provisional National Assembly in Vienna this was worded by the State Chancellor, [[Karl Renner]], "...to encounter the prejudices of the world as though we wanted to annex alien national property"<ref>[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&aid=spe&datum=00010003&seite=00000066&zoom=2] Minutes of the Third Session of the Provisional National Assembly of German-Austria on 12 Nov. 1918], in: Austrian National Library, ''Minutes of the Parliamentary Sessions'', p. 66</ref> The day before, on 11 Nov. 1918 the Provisional Diet of Carinthia had formally declared Carinthia's accession to the State of German-Austria.<ref>[http://www.landtag-noe.at/1918.pdf ''Kurze Geschichte Kärntens''], in: ''Deutschösterreich, du herrliches Land. 90 Jahre Konstituierung der Provisorischen Nationalversammlung.

===Disputed frontiers===

[[File:Koettmannsdorf Unterschlossberg Stausee und Strassenbruecke 03032015 0234.jpg|thumb|left|Road bridge across the [[Ferlach]] reservoir of the [[Drava]] River at Unterschlossberg, Koettmannsdorf, Klagenfurt, Carinthia, Austria]]
After the end of the [[World War&nbsp;I]], however, Carinthia became a contested region. On 5 November 1918, the first armed militia units led by the Slovene volunteer [[Franjo Malgaj]] invaded Carinthia and were then joined by Slovene troops under [[Rudolf Maister]]. With the subsequent assistance of the regular Yugoslav army, they occupied southern Carinthia claiming the area for the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (''Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca'', or SHS) also known as [[Yugoslavia]]. The provisional state government of Carinthia had fled to [[Spittal an der Drau]] and given the ongoing fighting between local volunteers and invaders on 5 December decided to declare armed resistance. The resistance encountered by the Yugoslav forces especially north of the [[Drava]] River around the town of [[Völkermarkt]] with its violent fighting alarmed the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].

An Allied Commission headed by U.S. Lt.Col. [[Sherman Miles]] inspected the situation in situ and recommended the Karawanken main ridge as a natural border to keep the Klagenfurt basin intact but, in agreement with item no.&nbsp;10 of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], suggested a referendum in the disputed area. An armistice was agreed upon on 14 January and by 7 May 1919 the Yugoslav forces had left the state, but Slovene troops under [[Rudolf Maister]] returned to occupying Klagenfurt on 6 June. Upon the intervention of the Allied Supreme Council in Paris, they retreated from the city but remained in the disputed part of Carinthia until 13 September 1920.

In the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 10 September 1919, the two smaller Slovene-speaking Carinthian valleys south of the [[Karawanken]] range, [[Seebergsattel|Jezersko]] and the [[Meža]] Valley, together with the town of [[Dravograd]]—together 128 square miles<ref name="Britannica" /> or {{convert|331|km2|2|abbr=on}}—were attached to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]): These areas are today part of [[Carinthia (Slovenia)|Slovene Carinthia]]. The Canale Valley ({{langx|de|Kanaltal}}, {{langx|it|Val Canale}}) as far south as [[Pontebba]], at that time an ethnically mixed German–Slovene area,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} with the border town of [[Tarvisio]] ({{langx|de|Tarvis}}, {{langx|sl|Trbiž}}) and its holy place of pilgrimage of Maria Luschari ({{langx|sl|Svete Višarje}}) (172 square miles<ref name ="Britannica">”Kärnten". Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago 2010.</ref> or 445&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), was ceded to [[Italy]] and included in the [[Province of Udine]].

According to the same treaty, a [[Carinthian Plebiscite|referendum]] was to be held in southern Carinthia as suggested by the Allied Commission, which was to determine whether the area claimed by the SHS-State was to remain part of Austria or go to Yugoslavia. Much of southern Carinthia was divided into two zones. Zone&nbsp;A was formed out of predominantly Slovene-inhabited zones (approximately corresponding to today's [[Völkermarkt (district)|District of Völkermarkt]], the district of [[Klagenfurt-Land]] south of lake [[Wörthersee]], and the south-eastern part of the present district of [[Villach-Land]]), while Zone&nbsp;B included the City of Klagenfurt, [[Velden am Wörthersee]] and the immediately surrounding rural areas where German speakers formed a vast majority. If the population in Zone&nbsp;A had decided for Yugoslavia, another referendum in Zone&nbsp;B would have followed. On 10 October 1920, the [[Carinthian Plebiscite]] was held in Zone&nbsp;A, with almost 60% of the population voting to remain in Austria, which means that about 40% of the Slovene-speaking population must have voted against a division of Carinthia. Given the close supervision of the referendum by foreign observers, as well as the Yugoslav occupation of the area until four weeks before the referendum, irregularities alleged by the deeply disappointed Yugoslav supporters would not have substantially altered the overall decision. Yet, after the plebiscite, the SHS-State again made attempts to occupy the area, but owing to demarches by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy it removed its troops from Austria so that, by 22 November 1920, the State Diet of Carinthia was at last able to exercise its sovereignty over the entire state.<ref>Claudia Fräss-Ehrfeld, ''Geschichte Kärntens 1918-1920.

===After World War I to present===
[[File:Flag of Carinthia (state).svg|thumb|right|Flag of Carinthia with the coat of arms]]
Originally an agrarian country, Carinthia made efforts to establish a touristic infrastructure such as the [[Grossglockner High Alpine Road]] and [[Klagenfurt Airport]] as well as the opening up of the [[Alps]] through the [[Österreichischer Alpenverein|Austrian Alpine Club]] in the 1920s. It was, however, hard hit by the [[Great Depression]] around 1930, which pushed the [[political system]] in Austria more and more towards [[extremism]]. This phenomenon culminated at first in the years of [[Austrofascism]] and then in 1938 in the [[annexation]] of Austria by [[Nazi Germany]] (''[[Anschluss]]''). At the same time the Nazi Party took power everywhere in Carinthia, which became, together with [[East Tyrol]], a ''[[Reichsgau]]'', and [[Nazism|Nazi]] leaders such as [[Franz Kutschera]], [[Hubert Klausner]], and [[Friedrich Rainer]] held the office of [[Gauleiter]] and [[Reichsstatthalter]].

During [[World War&nbsp;II]], [[Slovene Partisan]] resistance was active in the southern areas of the region, reaching around 3,000 armed men. The cities of [[Klagenfurt]] and [[Villach]] suffered from [[Strategic Bombing During World War II|air raids]], but the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces did not reach Carinthia before [[Victory in Europe Day|May 8, 1945]]. Toward the end of the war, Gauleiter Rainer tried to implement a Nazi plan for Carinthia to become part of the projected Nazi national redoubt, the ''[[Alpine Fortress|Alpenfestung]]''; these efforts failed and the forces under Rainer's control surrendered to the forces of the [[British Army]]. Once again at the end of World War&nbsp;II, Yugoslav troops occupied parts of Carinthia, including the capital city of Klagenfurt, but were soon forced to withdraw by the British forces with the consent of the [[Soviet Union]].

Carinthia, East Tyrol, and Styria then formed the UK occupation zone of [[Allied-administered Austria]]. The area was witness to the [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|turnover of German-allied Cossacks to the Red Army]] in 1945. The Allied occupation was terminated in 1955 by the [[Austrian State Treaty]], which restored Austria's sovereignty. The relations between the German- and the Slovene-speaking Carinthians remained somewhat problematic. Divergent views over the implementation of minority protection rights guaranteed by Article&nbsp;7 of the Austrian State Treaty have created numerous tensions between the two groups in the past fifty years.{{When|date=January 2019}}

In 2008, the proportion of the population with a migration background in Carinthia was 9.3% of the total population, about half the Austrian figure of 17.5%.<ref>Statistik Austria, Österreichischer Städtebund: ''Österreichs Städte in Zahlen 2009.'' Statistik Austria, Wien 2009</ref> By 2020, the proportion of the population with a migration background in Carinthia had risen to 14.5%, yet this figure remains lower than the Austrian average, where close to a quarter of the population has a migration background.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Österreich - Migrationshintergrund Bundesland 2020|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/293111/umfrage/bevoelkerungsanteil-mit-migrationshintergrund-in-oesterreich-nach-bundeslaendern/|access-date=2022-01-26|website=Statista|language=de}}</ref>

The majority of Carinthia's population is today German-speaking. In the south of the province (mainly in the districts of [[Villach-Land District|Villach-Land]] [[Klagenfurt-Land District|Klagenfurt-Land]] and [[Völkermarkt]]) live Carinthian Slovenes where they speak [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and are recognized as an autochthonous ethnic minority. The discussion about ethnic group rights (e.g. bilingual place-name signs) can be very emotional and the rights of Slovenes in Carinthia are still not fully implemented.

==Politics==
[[File:Klagenfurt Landhaus 25042009 31.jpg|thumb|Klagenfurt ''Landhaus'', seat of the Carinthian Landtag]]
The state assembly ''Kärntner [[Landtag]]'', ("Carinthian State Diet"), is a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[legislature]]. Its 36 members are elected from [[Party-list proportional representation|party lists]] according to the principle of [[proportional representation]] and serve five-year terms, with elections held every five years. Austrian nationals over the age of 16 residing in Carinthia are eligible to vote. The ''Landtag'' has a [[Election threshold|threshold]] of 5%. The current legislative period is the 30th since the first Carinthian elections on 6 April 1861.

The most recent election, the [[2018 Carinthian state election]], was held on 5 March 2018. The [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SPÖ]], the party of the incumbent governor [[Peter Kaiser]], almost reached the absolute majority of seats in the state assembly. This makes Carinthia one of Austria's most left-leaning regions.

The legislature also elects the state government, composed of a [[minister-president]], whose ancient title is ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'' ("State Captain"), his two deputies, and further four ''Landesräte'' ministers. The members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] form an all-party government elected under a system of proportional representation based on the number of representatives of the political parties in the ''Landtag''. The incumbent ''Landeshauptmann'' is Peter Kaiser (SPÖ).

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the state was 20.9 billion € in 2018, accounting for 5.4% of Austria's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €33,000  or 110% of the EU27 average in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

==Language==
[[German language|German]] is the official language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Landesnormen/LKT40011464/LKT40011464.pdf|title=Kärntner Landesverfassung -K-LVG}}</ref>

The people are predominantly German-speaking with a unique (and easily recognizable) [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] [[dialect]] typical of which is that all short German vowels before double consonants have been lengthened ("Carinthian vowel stretching").{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

A [[Slovene language|Slovene]]-speaking minority, known as the [[Carinthian Slovenes]], is concentrated in the southern and southeastern parts of the state. Its size cannot be determined precisely because the representatives of the ethnic group reject a count.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Recommendations for a boycott of the 2001 census, which asked for the language used in everyday communication, reduced the count of Slovene speakers to 12,554 people, 2.38% of a total population of 527,333.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/bevoelkerung/volkszaehlungen/bevoelkerung_nach_demographischen_merkmalen/022886.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090620083650/http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/bevoelkerung/volkszaehlungen/bevoelkerung_nach_demographischen_merkmalen/022886.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-06-20 |title=Bevölkerung mit österreichischer Staatsbürgerschaft nach Umgangssprache seit 1971|language=de|publisher=Statistik Austria|access-date=2009-04-13}}</ref>

==Tourist attractions==
[[File:Gurk Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Gurk Cathedral]]
Major sights include the cities of [[Klagenfurt]] and [[Villach]] and medieval towns like [[Friesach]] or [[Gmünd, Carinthia|Gmünd]]. Carinthia features numerous monasteries and churches such as the Romanesque [[Gurk Cathedral]] or [[Maria Saal]] in the [[Zollfeld plain]], the abbeys of [[St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal|St.&nbsp;Paul's]], [[Ossiach Abbey|Ossiach]], [[Millstatt Abbey|Millstatt]], and [[Viktring Abbey|Viktring]] as well as castles and palaces like large-scale [[Hochosterwitz Castle|Hochosterwitz]], [[Burgruine Griffen|Griffen]], or [[Schloss Porcia|Porcia]].

Scenic highlights are the main bathing lakes [[Wörthersee]], [[Millstätter See]], [[Lake Ossiach|Ossiacher See]] and [[Faaker See]] as well as a variety of smaller lakes and ponds. In winter Carinthia offers [[ski resort]]s such as the [[Nassfeld]] near Hermagor, [[Gerlitzen]] mountain, [[Bad Kleinkirchheim]], [[Flattach]], and [[Heiligenblut]] at Austria's highest mountain, the [[Grossglockner]] as well as the [[Hohe Tauern]] and [[Nock Mountains]] [[national park]]s for all kind of alpine sports and [[mountaineering]].

==Culture==
===Customs and traditions===
One of many customs that still subsists all over Carinthia are Kirchtage, a traditional type of [[fair]]. The most famous is [[Villacher Kirchtag]] in [[Villach]], which was first held in 1936 and is very popular among locals and tourists.

===Museums===
The museums in Carinthia include the [[Carinthian State Museum]] with its locations in Klagenfurt, the [[Maria Saal open-air museum]], the [[Magdalensberg Archaeological Park]], and the [[Teurnia Roman Museum]]. One of the most important city museums is the [[City Museum of Villach]], which documents, among other things, the life story of its temporary citizen [[Paracelsus]].

===Literature===
Carinthia has produced several internationally renowned writers in recent decades. In the early 20th century, [[Robert Musil]], Josef Friedrich Perkonig, Dolores Viesèr, and Gerhart Ellert gained some notoriety.

After the Second World War, the poets [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], Michael Guttenbrunner, and [[Christine Lavant]] first came to the fore. They were followed by [[Peter Handke]], Gert Jonke, Josef Winkler, and [[Peter Turrini]]. Among other things, they took a very critical look at their homeland, like Josef Winkler in his trilogy "Das wilde Kärnten". Other important representatives of Carinthian literature include Janko Messner, Janko Ferk, [[Lydia Mischkulnig]], Werner Kofler, Antonio Fian, and Florjan Lipus.

The most important publishers are Johannes Heyn, Carinthia, and the Carinthian printing and publishing company. Slovenian literature is primarily promoted by the Carinthian publishers Mohorjeva/Hermagoras, Drava, and the Wieser-Verlag founded by Lojze Wieser.

The most important literary event in Carinthia is the Days of German-language Literature in Klagenfurt, during which the [[Festival of German-Language Literature|Ingeborg Bachmann Prize]] is awarded, which has been held annually since 1977 and particularly supports younger authors. The Ingeborg Bachmann Prize is one of the most important literary awards in the German-speaking world.

===Fine Arts===
In the early 20th century, the Nötsch circle was active with the painters Sebastian Isepp, Franz Wiegele, Anton Kolig, and Anton Mahringer with its European orientation. The painter Herbert Boeckl was only loosely associated with the circle. An art-political controversy was the dispute over the Kolig frescoes in the Klagenfurt country house from 1931, which ended in the removal of the frescoes in 1938. In terms of architecture, Gustav Gugitz, the builder of the State Museum, should be mentioned, while the Wörthersee architecture with the villas and hotels is primarily characterized by Viennese architects. Switbert Lobisser is known for his woodcuts. Werner Berg made woodcuts and paintings, especially of his adoptive home in Bleiburg.

After 1945, [[Maria Lassnig]], Hans Staudacher, and Hans Bischoffshausen initiated a radical new beginning. Important sites were and are the Carinthian Art Association, the Hildebrand Gallery, the Nötscher-Kreis-Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art Carinthia, which opened in 2003. Two high-profile "art scandals" were the frescoes by Giselbert Hoke in Klagenfurt main station in 1950 and the redesign of the meeting room in the country house in 1998 by Anton Kolig's grandson, Cornelius Kolig.

A fountain designed by [[Kiki Kogelnik]] stands near the country house. Other visual artists are Valentin Oman, Bruno Gironcoli, Meina Schellander, and Karl Brandstätter. In Carinthia, the architect Günther Domenig designed the Steinhaus am Ossiacher See, the building for the state exhibition in Hüttenberg and the extension for the Klagenfurt city theater.
