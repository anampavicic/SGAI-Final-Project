'''Khairpur''' ([[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], {{langx|ur|{{Nastaliq|خيرپور}}}}) is a city and the capital of the [[Khairpur District]] of [[Pakistan]]'s [[Sindh]] province.

==History==
{{Main|Talpur dynasty}}

The Talpur dynasty was established in 1783 by Mir Fateh Ali Khan, who declared himself the first ''Rais'', or ruler of Sindh, after defeating the [[Kalhora dynasty|Kalhoras]] at the [[Battle of Halani]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=R. V.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47sfj8DUwNgC&dq=talpur+sindh&pg=PA337|title=Indian States: A Biographical, Historical, and Administrative Survey|last2=Bond|first2=J. W.|date=2006|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1965-4|language=en}}</ref>

The death of Mir Sohrab Khan Talpur, founder of the Khairpur branch abdicated power to his eldest son Mir Rustam 'Ali Khan, in 1811.<ref name=":0" />[[File:Khairpur_map.gif|left|thumb|Khairpur State (marked in red) joined Pakistan as a princely state in 1947]]
Rustam ruled until 1842, when abdicated in favor of his youngest brother Mir Ali Murad. Ali Murad helped the British in 1845-7 during the Turki campaign, but was later accused of plotting against the British in 1851–2, and so was stripped of his lands in upper Sindh by the [[British East India|British East India Company]]. As a result, the remaining land under his control consisted mostly of Khairpur city, and its immediate environs. During the 1857 [[Sepoy Mutiny]], Ali Murad sided with the British, and prevented rebels from seizing the [[Shikarpur, Sindh|Shikarpur]] jail and treasury.<ref name=":0" /> He regained the favour of the British, and in 1866, the British promised to recognize any future successors as rightful rulers of Khairpur.<ref name=":0" />

Ali Murad's eldest son had predeceased him, and so he was succeeded by his second son, Mir Faiz Muhammad Khan, who ruled until his death 1909.<ref name=":0" /> He was in turn succeeded by his son, Mir Imam Bakhsh Khan Talpur,<ref name=":0" /> who aided the British war effort during [[World War I]], and was thus awarded the honorary title Lieutenant Colonel in 1918.<ref name=":0" /> He died in 1921, and was succeeded by His Highness Mir Ali Nawaz Khan. Under his rule, the feudal ''Cherr'' system of forced labour was abolished, while new canals were laid for irrigation.<ref name=":0" />
