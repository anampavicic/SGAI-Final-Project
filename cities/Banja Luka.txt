==Name==
The name ''Banja Luka'' was first mentioned in a document dated to 6 February 1494 by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Ladislaus II of Hungary]]. The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' (a medieval noble title), and ''luka'' ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remains uncertain, and [[popular etymology]] combines the modern words ''banja'' ('bath' or 'spa'), or ''bajna'' ('marvelous') and ''luka'' ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name ''Lukácsbánya'', in English 'Luke's Mine'. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and occasionally written as one word (''Banjaluka'').<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 Ivan Lovrenović, " 'Serb' towns in Bosnia"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031032/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 |date=28 September 2007 }}, BH Dani, 20 July 2001</ref>

==Geography==
===Overview===
Banja Luka covers some {{cvt|96.2|km2|sqmi}} of land in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is situated on both banks of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region. Banja Luka's centre lies {{cvt|163|m|2}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The source of the Vrbas River is about {{cvt|90|km}} to the south at the [[Vranica]] mountain. Its tributaries—the Suturlija, the Crkvena, and the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]]—flow into the Vrbas at various points in the city. A number of springs can be found nearby.

The area around Banja Luka is mostly woodland and acre fields, although there are many mountains further from the city, especially south from the city. The most notable of these mountains are Ponir (743 m), Osmača (950 m), Manjača (1,214 m), Čemernica (1,338 m), and Tisovac (1,173 m). These are all part of the [[Dinaric Alps]] mountain range.

The history of inhabitation of the area of Banja Luka dates back to ancient times. There is substantial evidence of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] presence in the region during the first few centuries A.D., including the fort "Kastel" ({{langx|la|Castra}}) in the centre of the city. The area comprising Banja Luka was entirely in the kingdom of Illyria and then a part of the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], which split into provinces of [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia]] of which Castra became a part. Ancient Illyrian maps call the settlement in Banja Luka's present day location as Ad Ladios,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/197066 |title=Ad Ladios: a Pleiades place resource |website=Pleiades: a gazetteer of past places |date=23 October 2012 |access-date=15 June 2012 |archive-date=13 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213061903/http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/197066 |url-status=live }}</ref> a settlement located on the river [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]].

===Middle Ages===
{{Further|Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages}}

Slavs settled in the Balkans in the 6th century. Mediaeval fortresses in the vicinity of Banja Luka include Vrbas (1224), Župa Zemljanik (1287), [[Kotor Varoš]] (1323), Zvečaj (1404), and Bočac (1446). In one document written by king
[[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislav II]] on 6 February 1494 Juraj Mikulasić was mentioned as [[castellan]] of Banja Luka. Below the town was a smaller settlement with one Catholic monastery.<ref>HAMDIJA KREŠEVLJAKOVIĆ

Banja Luka fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1527. It became the seat of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]] some time prior to 1554, until 1580 when the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] was established. Bosnian beylerbeys were seated in Banja Luka until 1639.<ref name="Hercegovine1952">{{cite book |author=Društvo istoričara Bosne i Hercegovine |title=Godišnjak: Annuaire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyQSAAAAIAAJ |year=1952 |quote=Бања Лука је постала сједиште босанског санџака нешто прије 1554 и остала то све до 1580 када је основан босански пашалук.

It was also the central sanjak in the Bosnia Eyalet. In 1688, the city was burned down by the Austrian army, but it quickly recovered. Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century.

In the 19th century, [[Sephardic Jews]] and [[Trappists]] migrated to the city and contributed to the early [[industrialization]] of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories, and other important structures.<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Teinović |author-first=Bratislav |year=2018 |chapter=Trapistička opatija „Marija Zvijezda” u Banjaluci (1869–2009)/The Trappist Abbey „Marija Zvijezda” in Banjaluka (1869–2009) |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/63547005 |editor-last=Matijević |editor-first=Margareta |title=Trapisti u Banjoj Luci – Europa u Bosni i Hercegovini |location=[[Zagreb]] |publisher=Croatian Institute of History |language=hr |isbn=978-953-7840-07-5 |access-date=15 July 2023}}</ref> The [[Mariastern Abbey, Banja Luka|Trappist monastery]] built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of ''Trappisti'' and has left a large legacy in the area through its [[Trappista cheese|Trappist cheese]] and its [[Trappist beer|beer production]].<ref name="Teinović-2020-Bosna Franciscana">{{cite journal |last1=Teinović |first1=Bratislav |title=Trapistička opatija Marija Zvijezda.

In 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to [[Lešnica, Serbia|Lešnica]], [[Lipnica (Loznica)|Lipnica]], and [[Loznica]], the villages around Loznica, and to [[Šabac]].<ref>Jovan Cvijić, Balkansko poluostrvo i južnoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje udžbenika, 1966), pp. 151-152.</ref>

===Austro-Hungarian rule===
Despite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in the late 19th century. Railroads, schools, factories, and infrastructure appeared, and were developed, which turned Banja Luka into a modern city.

===Yugoslavia===
[[File:Саборна_црква_Христа_спаситеља_004.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Banja Luka|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]]]]

After World War I, the town became the capital of the [[Vrbas Banovina]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].
The provincial capital owed its rapid progress to the first Ban Svetislav Milosavljević. During that time, the Banski dvor and its twin sister, the Administration building, the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, a theatre and a museum were built, the Grammar School was renovated, the Teachers College enlarged, a city bridge was built and the park renovated.
125 elementary schools were functioning in Banja Luka in 1930. The revolutionary ideas of the time were incubated by the "Pelagić" association and the Students' Club. Banja Luka naturally became the organisational centre of anti-fascist work in the region.

====World War II====
{{Main|Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia}}

During World War II, Banja Luka was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops and was included into the [[Independent State of Croatia]], a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[puppet-state]] led by [[Ante Pavelić|Pavelić's]] [[Ustaše]]. Most of Banja Luka's Serbs and Jews were deported to concentration camps such as [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] and [[Stara Gradiška concentration camp|Stara Gradiška]]. The Jasenovac camp was one of the largest [[extermination camp]]s in Europe, which was notorious for its high mortality rate and the barbaric practices which occurred in it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pavlowitch |first=Stevan K. |title=Hitler's New Disorder: The Second World War in Yugoslavia |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-85065-895-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8d2409V9tEC |page=34 |access-date=18 May 2020 |archive-date=13 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230213082915/https://books.google.com/books?id=R8d2409V9tEC |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Levy |first=Michele Frucht |title="The Last Bullet for the Last Serb": The Ustaša Genocide against Serbs: 1941–1945 |journal=Nationalities Papers |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=807–837 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/00905990903239174 |s2cid=162231741}}</ref> On 7 February 1942, Ustaše paramilitaries, led by a Franciscan friar, [[Miroslav Filipović]] (aka Tomislav Filipović-Majstorović), [[Banja Luka massacre|killed more than 2,300 Serbs]] (among them 500 children) in [[Drakulić, Banja Luka|Drakulić]], [[Motike, Banja Luka|Motike]] and [[Šargovac]] (a part of the Banja Luka municipality).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtrs.tv/vijesti/vijest.php?id=45305 |title=Radio-Televizija Republike Srpske |publisher=Rtrs.tv |date=29 August 2011 |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-date=12 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112033218/http://www.rtrs.tv/vijesti/vijest.php?id=45305 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city's [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Banja Luka|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] and Orthodox church of the Holy Trinity were totally demolished by the Ustaše, as was the Church of St. George in [[Petrićevac]]. The [[Eparchy of Banja Luka|Bishop of Banja Luka]], [[Platon of Banja Luka|Platon Jovanović]], was arrested by the Ustaše on 5 May 1941, and was tortured and killed.

==Economy==
[[File:Зграда ГП Крајина.jpg|thumb|GP Krajina building]]

In 1981, Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book |title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju |year=1984 |edition=3rd |publisher=Sveučilišna naklada Liber |location=Zagreb |language=hr |editor1-first=Radovan |editor1-last=Radovinović |editor2-first=Ivan |editor2-last=Bertić}}</ref>

Although the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, with socially owned technology firms such as [[Rudi Čajavec (company)|SOUR Rudi Čajavec]] collapsing, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as [[Telekom Srpske]], Rafinerija ulja Modriča, [[Banjalučka Pivara]] and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Serbia]], now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from [[Norway]], the United States, Japan and China.

A number of financial services regulators, such as the [[Republika Srpska Securities Commission]] and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
