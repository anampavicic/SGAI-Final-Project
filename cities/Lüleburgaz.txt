'''Lüleburgaz''' ({{IPA|tr|lyˈlebuɾɡaz|lang}}; [[Modern Greek]]: Λουλέ Μπουργκάς ''Lule Burgas''; [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Люлебургаз ''Lyuleburgaz''), '''Bergoule''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Βεργούλη) or '''Arcadiopolis''' (Ancient Greek: Ἀρκαδιούπολις ''Arkadiópolis'') is the largest city of [[Kırklareli Province]] in the [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara region]] of [[Turkey]]. It is the seat of [[Lüleburgaz District]].<ref name=ilce>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İlçe Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory.

Lüleburgaz is a hub for road and rail transportation, with the city being connected to Istanbul and Edirne by the [[Istanbul-Kapıkule Regional Train]] and to Plovdiv, Sofia, Belgrade, Bucharest and Budapest by the [[Bosphorus Express]] and the [[Istanbul-Sofia Express]].

Its best known attraction is the 16th-century [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque, Lüleburgaz|Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque]], named after the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa|Mehmet Paşa Sokolović]] and designed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] chief [[architect]] [[Mimar Sinan]] who also designed a bridge for the city.

==History==
[[File:MadridSkylitzesFol37rDetail.jpg|left|thumb|The surrender and humiliation of [[Thomas the Slav]] in the [[Madrid Skylitzes|Skylitzes manuscript]].]]
The city used to be the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Europa (Roman province)|Europa]], established by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] in 294.

The city's ancient name was [[Bergula]] but Emperor [[Theodosius I]] changed it to Arcadiopolis in honour of his son and successor [[Arcadius]]. The city of Arcadiopolis fell to [[Attila the Hun]] during his campaign against the Eastern Roman Empire in 443 AD.

During the revolt of [[Thomas the Slav]] against [[Michael II]], the city was Thomas' last refuge after the defection of his troops in 823. Michael II invested the city and after more than five months of siege, the exhausted and starving troops gave up their leader in exchange for an imperial pardon. Thomas was handed over on a donkey and tortured.

The [[Battle of Arcadiopolis (970)|Battle of Arcadiopolis]] of 970 saw the Byzantine forces defeat an invading [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan]]-[[Pechenegs|Pecheneg]]-[[Hungarian people|Magyar]] force who were aiming to capture [[Constantinople]], {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} to the east.

As the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Europa (Roman province)|Europa]], Acradiopolis had its [[Diocese of Arcadiopolis|own bishop]], who was recorded as attending a number of important church councils; it was noted as an [[autocephalous]] archbishopric by the seventh century.  It is no longer a residential bishopric, although the [[Diocese of Arcadiopolis]] survives as a Roman Catholic [[titular see]]. [[Marcel Lefebvre]], the founder of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]], was one of its [[titular bishop]]s.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d3a68.html Listing on Catholic-hierarchy.org]</ref>

Lüleburgaz came under Ottoman control during the early period of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s enlargement to Balkans.

The [[Battle of Lule Burgas|Battle of Lüleburgaz]] was fought between 28 October and 2 November 1912 during the [[First Balkan War]]. The city was occupied by the Greek army between 1920 and 1922, before becoming part of the Modern Turkish Republic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arslan |first1=Ali |title=Kasabadan kente bir Cumhuriyet yürüyüşü: Lüleburgaz; II.
