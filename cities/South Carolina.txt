'''South Carolina''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-South Carolina.ogg|ˌ|k|ær|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|n|ə}} {{respell|KARR|ə|LY|nə}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] region of the [[United States]]. It borders [[North Carolina]] to the north and northeast, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the southeast, and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the southwest and south across the [[Savannah River]]. Along with North Carolina, it makes up the [[Carolinas]] region of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].

After the [[American Civil War]], it was readmitted to the Union on July 9, 1868.

During the early-to-mid 20th century, the state started to see economic progress as many [[Textile manufacturing|textile mills]] and [[Mill town|factories]] were built across the state. The [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century helped end segregation and legal discrimination policies within the state.

Within South Carolina from east to west are three main geographic regions, the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], and the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in the northwestern corner of [[Upstate South Carolina]]. South Carolina has primarily a [[humid subtropical climate]], with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Areas in the Upstate have a [[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]]. Along South Carolina's eastern coastal plain are many [[salt marsh]]es and [[Estuary|estuaries]]. South Carolina's southeastern [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] contains portions of the [[Sea Islands]], a chain of [[barrier island]]s along the Atlantic Ocean.

ScienceDaily, November 18, 2004.</ref> At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end [[Pre-Columbian era]] around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the [[Cherokee]] and the [[Catawba people|Catawba]], with a total population being up to 20,000.<ref name=leifermann>{{cite book|last1=Liefermann|first1=Henry|last2=Horan|first2=Eric|title=South Carolina|date=2000|publisher=Compass American Guides|location=Oakland, CA|isbn=978-0-679-00509-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/compassamericang00henr/page/13 13–47, 252–254]|edition=3rd|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/compassamericang00henr/page/13}}</ref>

Up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] background. Along the [[Savannah River]] were the [[Apalachee]], [[Yuchi]], and the [[Yamasee]]. Further west were the Cherokee, and along the [[Catawba River]], the Catawba. These tribes were village-dwellers, relying on agriculture as their primary food source.<ref name="leifermann" /> The Cherokee lived in [[wattle and daub]] houses made with wood and clay, roofed with wood or [[Thatching|thatched]] grass.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reference.com/history/type-dwellings-did-cherokee-indians-live-a45ad525016b2b?qo=contentSimilarQuestions|title=What type of dwellings did the Cherokee Indians live in?|newspaper=Reference|access-date=February 12, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212163851/https://www.reference.com/history/type-dwellings-did-cherokee-indians-live-a45ad525016b2b?qo=contentSimilarQuestions|archive-date=February 12, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

About a dozen or more separate small tribes summered on the coast harvesting oysters and fish, and cultivating corn, peas and beans. Travelling inland as much as {{convert|50|mi|km}} mostly by canoe, they wintered on the coastal plain, hunting deer and gathering nuts and fruit. The names of these tribes survive in place names like [[Edisto Island, South Carolina|Edisto Island]], [[Kiawah Island, South Carolina|Kiawah Island]], and the [[Ashepoo River]].<ref name="leifermann" />

===Exploration===
{{Main|Spanish Florida|French Florida}}
[[File:Floride francaise Pierre du Val.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[French Florida]], which included modern-day South Carolina]]

The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. From June 24 to July 14, 1521, they explored the land around [[Winyah Bay]]. On October 8, 1526, they founded [[San Miguel de Gualdape]], near present-day [[Georgetown, South Carolina]]. It was the first European settlement in what is now the [[contiguous United States]]. Established with five hundred settlers, it was abandoned eight months later by one hundred and fifty survivors. In 1540, [[Hernando de Soto]] explored the region and the main town of [[Cofitachequi]], where he captured the queen of the [[Muscogee|Maskoki]] (Muscogee) and the [[Cherokee|Chelaque]] (Cherokee) who had welcomed him.

In 1562 French [[Huguenot]]s established a settlement at what is now the [[Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site|Charlesfort-Santa Elena]] archaeological site on [[Parris Island, South Carolina|Parris Island]]. Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. The garrison lacked supplies, however, and the soldiers (as in the [[France Antarctique]]) soon ran away. The French returned two years later but settled in present-day Florida rather than South Carolina.<ref name="leifermann" />

Sixty years later, in 1629, King [[Charles I of England]] established the province of [[Carolana]], an area covering what is now South and [[North Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Tennessee]]. Carolana was granted to [[Sir Robert Heath]], who intended to allow French [[Huguenots]] to settle there; however, King Charles refused to grant permission to settle to anyone who was not a member of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]], leading to the failure of the colony. In 1663, King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] created the [[Province of Carolina]] by granting the same land to eight [[Lords Proprietors]] in return for their financial and political assistance in [[Restoration (1660)|restoring]] him to the throne in 1660.<ref>{{cite book|first=Danforth|last=Prince|title=Frommer's The Carolinas and Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43yVaZoByecC|date=March 10, 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-03341-8|page=11|access-date=September 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427112527/https://books.google.com/books?id=43yVaZoByecC|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], one of the Lord Proprietors, planned the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]] and wrote the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]], which laid the basis for the future colony.<ref>Wilson, Thomas D.

In the 1670s, English planters from Barbados established themselves near what is now Charleston. Settlers from all over Europe built rice plantations in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry]], east of the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]]. Plantation labor was done by African slaves who formed the majority of the population by 1720.<ref name="sc-lib">{{cite web|title=South Carolina Information: History and Culture|url=http://statelibrary.sc.libguides.com/sc-information/history-culture|website=SC State Library|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213090530/http://statelibrary.sc.libguides.com/sc-information/history-culture|archive-date=February 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Another cash crop was the [[Indigofera|indigo plant]], a plant source of blue dye, developed by [[Eliza Lucas]].
 
Meanwhile, [[Upstate South Carolina]], west of the Fall Line, was settled by small farmers and traders, who due to resource competition fought a number of wars with confederated Native American tribes westward. Colonists overthrew the proprietors' rule, seeking more direct representation. In 1712, the former [[Province of Carolina]] split into North and South Carolina. In 1719, South Carolina was officially made a [[crown colony|royal colony]].

South Carolina prospered from the fertility of the lowcountry and the harbors, such as at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. It allowed religious toleration, encouraging settlement, and trade in deerskin, lumber, and beef thrived. Rice cultivation was developed on a large scale on the back of slave labor.

By the second half of the 1700s, South Carolina was one of the richest of the [[Thirteen Colonies]].<ref name="sc-lib"/>

In the Antebellum period (before the Civil War) the state's economy and population grew. Cotton became an important crop after the invention of the [[cotton gin]]. While nominally democratic, from 1790 until 1865, wealthy male landowners were in control of South Carolina. For example, a man was not eligible to sit in the State House of Representatives unless he possessed an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 Negroes, or at least 150 pounds sterling.<ref>{{cite web|title=South Carolina Constitution of 1790|url=http://www.carolana.com/SC/Documents/sc_constitution_1790.html|access-date=February 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214181241/http://www.carolana.com/SC/Documents/sc_constitution_1790.html|archive-date=February 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], the new state capital was founded in the center of the state, and the State Legislature first met there in 1790. The town grew after it was connected to Charleston by the [[Santee Canal]] in 1800, one of the first canals in the United States.

As dissatisfaction of the planters ruling class with the federal government grew, in the 1820s [[John C. Calhoun]] became a leading proponent of [[states' rights]], [[limited government]], [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification of the U.S. Constitution]], and [[free trade]]. In 1832, the [[Ordinance of Nullification]] declared federal tariff laws unconstitutional and not to be enforced in the state, leading to the [[Nullification Crisis]]. The federal [[Force Bill]] was enacted to use whatever military force necessary to enforce federal law in the state, bringing South Carolina back into line.

An 1831 House Report from the Committee on Military Affairs noted that {{blockquote |text=Before the commencement of the war with Great Britain, and for a long time afterwards, the State of South Carolina was almost destitute of any of the means of military protection, excepting as such could be furnished by her own resources.

In the [[1860 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 1860]], voting was sharply divided, with the South voting for the [[Southern Democrats]] and the North for [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Lincoln was anti-slavery, did not acknowledge the right to [[Secession in the United States|secession]], and would not yield federal property in Southern states. Southern secessionists believed Lincoln's election meant long-term doom for their slavery-based agrarian economy and social system.<ref>[[Avery Craven]], [http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-growth-of-southern-nationalism-1848-1861/ ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism, 1848–1861''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525205452/http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-growth-of-southern-nationalism-1848-1861/ |date=May 25, 2017 }}, 1953. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-0006-6}}, p. 391, 394, 396.</ref>

On April 12, 1861, Confederate batteries began shelling the Union [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston Harbor, and the [[American Civil War]] began. In November of that year, the Union attacked [[Port Royal Sound]] and soon occupied [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort County]] and the neighboring [[Sea Islands]]. For the rest of the war, this area served as a Union base and staging point for other operations. Whites abandoned their plantations,<ref name="palm-hist"/> leaving behind about ten thousand enslaved people. Several Northern charities partnered with the federal government to help these people run the cotton farms themselves under the [[Port Royal Experiment]].

===Reconstruction 1865–1877===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}

In ''[[Texas vs. White]]'' (1869), the Supreme Court ruled the ordinances of secession (including that of South Carolina) were invalid, and thus those states had never left the Union. However, South Carolina did not regain representation in Congress until that date.

Until the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], South Carolina's legislature, not the voters, chose the state's electors for the presidential election. South Carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner. During Reconstruction, South Carolina maintained a majority-black government, which lasted until approximately 1876 when Democrats and former Confederates committed voter fraud to regain power.<ref name="Richardson2018">{{cite web |last=Richardson |first=Heather |date=16 March 2018 |title=South Carolina's Remarkable Democratic Experiment of 1868 |url=http://werehistory.org/south-carolinas-remarkable-democratic-experiment/ |access-date=26 May 2020 |website=We're History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The First South Carolina Legislature After the 1867 Reconstruction Acts |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/reconstruction-era/first-south-carolina-legislature |access-date=26 May 2020 |website=Facing History and Ourselves|date=March 14, 2016 }}</ref><ref>Lawrence Edward Carter.

In 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the [[Compromise of 1877]] that ended Reconstruction.

===Populist and agrarian movements===

The state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the Populist and Agrarian movements of the 1890s. A Republican-Populist biracial coalition took power away from White Democrats temporarily. To prevent that from happening again, Democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 which effectively [[Disfranchisement#United States|disenfranchised]] almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency, and [[literacy test]]s that dramatically reduced the voter rolls. By 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls, although they constituted a majority of the state's population.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000, p.12] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121211213/https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 |date=November 21, 2018 }}.

The 1895 constitution overturned local representative government, reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government, effectively ruled by the General Assembly, through the legislative delegations for each county. As each county had one state senator, that person had considerable power. The counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975.<ref name="governance">[http://www.charlestoncounty.org/MAP/FinalReport/pages219-238.pdf Charlie B. Tyler, "The South Carolina Governance Project"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629080345/http://www.charlestoncounty.org/MAP/FinalReport/pages219-238.pdf |date=June 29, 2019 }}, University of South Carolina, 1998, pp. 221–222</ref>

Governor [[Benjamin Tillman|"Pitchfork Ben" Tillman]], a Populist, led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites, although he controlled Democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers. During the constitutional convention in 1895, he supported another man's proposal that the state adopt a [[one-drop rule]], as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known African ancestry.

Some members of the convention realized prominent white families with some African ancestry could be affected by such legislation. In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal (which was dropped), George Dionysius Tillman said in opposition:
<blockquote>If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in [[Aiken County, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[Barnwell County, South Carolina|Barnwell]], [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton]], and [[Orangeburg County, South Carolina|Orangeburg]] will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of{{nbsp}}... colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.<ref>"All Niggers, More or Less!"

The state postponed such a one-drop law for years. Virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924, forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white.

===20th century===
[[File:Some of the children who go to school half a day.jpg|thumb|Children workers {{circa|1912}}. Some children who worked in South Carolina textile mills went to school half a day and worked before and after school—and eight or nine hours on Saturday.]]
Early in the 20th century, South Carolina developed a thriving [[textile industry]]. The state also converted its main agricultural base from cotton, to more profitable crops. It would attract large [[military base]]s during [[World War I]], through its majority Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party [[Solid South]] following disfranchisement of blacks.

In the late 19th century, South Carolina would implement [[List of Jim Crow law examples by state|Jim Crow laws]] which enforced [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] policies until the 1960s. During the early-to-mid part of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs, opportunities, and relative freedom in U.S. cities outside the former Confederate states. In total from 1910 to 1970, 6.5&nbsp;million blacks left the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. By 1930, South Carolina had a white majority population for the first time since 1708.<ref name="info">[http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/us/south-carolina-history.html "South Carolina: The Decline of Agriculture and the Rise of Jim Crowism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210220713/http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/us/south-carolina-history.html |date=December 10, 2014 }}, infoplease (''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia''), 2012</ref> South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] (1920) giving women the right to vote. The South Carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on July 1, 1969.

The state can be divided into three natural geographic areas which then can be subdivided into five distinct cultural regions. The natural environment is divided from east to west by the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], and the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. Culturally, the coastal plain is split into the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and the [[Pee Dee]] region. While, the upper [[Piedmont, South Carolina|Piedmont]] region is referred to as the Piedmont and the lower Piedmont region is referred to as the Midlands.

Altogether, the state has a total area of {{convert|32020.49|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|30060.70|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1959.79|sqmi}} (6.12%) is water.<ref name="2010TotalArea">{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/2010/cph-2/cph-2-1.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |archive-date=October 9, 2022 |url-status=live|title=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts, 2010 Census of Population and Housing|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|pages=V&ndash;2, 1 & 41 (Tables 1 & 18)|date=September 2012|access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref>

===Atlantic Coastal Plain===
{{Main|South Carolina Lowcountry}}
The Atlantic [[Coastal plain]] consists of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present. The terrain is relatively flat and the soil is composed predominantly of sand, silt, and clay. Areas with better drainage make excellent farmland, though some land is swampy. An unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of low-relief topographic depressions named [[Carolina bay]]s. The bays tend to be oval, lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation. The eastern portion of the coastal plain contains many [[salt marsh]]es and [[estuary|estuaries]], as well as natural ports such as [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The [[Nature|natural]] areas of the coastal plain are part of the [[Middle Atlantic coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]].<ref name="ecoregions">{{cite journal|author1=Olson, D. M |author2=E. Dinerstein |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933–938 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |display-authors=etal  |doi-access=free  | issn = 0006-3568 }}</ref>

The [[Sandhills (Carolina)|Sandhills]] or Carolina Sandhills is a {{convert|10–35|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide region within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, along the [[wikt:inland|inland]] margin of this province. The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago. Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures and stronger winds.<ref>Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs, K.M., 2016, "The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States": Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286; www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research</ref>

===Piedmont===
Much of Piedmont consists of Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks, and the landscape has relatively low relief. Due to the changing economics of farming, much of the land is now reforested in [[loblolly pine]] for the lumber industry. These forests are part of the [[Southeastern mixed forests]] ecoregion.<ref name="ecoregions" /> At the southeastern edge of Piedmont is the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], where rivers drop to the coastal plain. The fall line was an important early source of water power. Mills built to this resource encouraged the growth of several cities, including the capital, [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line, providing a trade route for mill towns.

The northwestern part of Piedmont is also known as the Foothills. The [[South Carolina Highway 11|Cherokee Parkway]] is a scenic driving route through this area. This is where [[Table Rock State Park (South Carolina)|Table Rock State Park]] is located.

===Blue Ridge===
[[File:Pinnacle Mountain (South Carolina) viewed from Caesars Head, June 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Pinnacle Mountain (South Carolina)|Pinnacle Mountain]] viewed from [[Caesars Head]]]]
The Blue Ridge consists primarily of Precambrian metamorphic rocks, and the landscape has relatively high relief. The Blue Ridge Region contains an [[escarpment]] of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] that continues into [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]].

===Earthquakes===
{{Main|List of earthquakes in South Carolina}}
South Carolina is the most seismically active state on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Nevin |title=DHEC answers: Is mining causing the recent earthquakes? |url=https://www.wistv.com/2022/06/30/dhec-answers-questions-mining-recent-earthquakes/ |website=WISTV |date=June 30, 2022 |access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref> Between July 1, 2021, and July 1, 2022, there were 74 recorded earthquakes in South Carolina,<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |title=Recent Earthquakes |url=https://www.dnr.sc.gov/geology/recent-earthquakes.html |website=SCDNR Geological Survey |publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources |access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref> six of which exceeded a 3 magnitude.<ref>{{cite web |title=Recent Earthquakes Near South Carolina, United States |url=https://earthquaketrack.com/p/united-states/south-carolina/recent?mag_filter=3 |website=Earthquaketracker.com |access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref> In 2021 and 2022, most of which were concentrated in [[Kershaw County, South Carolina|Kershaw County]] and the coastal area of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].<ref name="auto1"/> The Charleston area demonstrates the greatest frequency of earthquakes in South Carolina. South Carolina averages 10–15 earthquakes a year below magnitude{{nbsp}}3 (FEMA). The [[1886 Charleston earthquake|Charleston earthquake of 1886]] was the largest quake ever to hit the eastern United States. The 7.0–7.3 magnitude earthquake killed 60 people and destroyed much of the city.<ref>Abridged from ''Seismicity of the United States, 1568–1989 (Revised)'', by Carl W. Stover and Jerry L. Coffman, U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1527, United States Government Printing Office, Washington: 1993.</ref> Faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them. Many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of South Carolina}}
[[File:SCprecipitation.gif|thumb|left|A map of the average annual [[precipitation]] in South Carolina]]
South Carolina has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), although high-elevation areas in the Upstate area have fewer subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline. In the summer, South Carolina is hot and humid, with daytime temperatures averaging between {{convert|86|-|93|F|C}} in most of the state and overnight lows averaging {{convert|70|-|75|F|C}} on the coast and from {{convert|66|-|73|F|C}} inland. Winter temperatures are much less uniform in South Carolina. Coastal areas of the state have very mild winters, with high temperatures approaching an average of {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and overnight lows around 40&nbsp;°F (5–8&nbsp;°C). [[File:South Carolina Snow Plow.png|thumb|right|A snow plow in South Carolina. The upstate and mountainous region of the state receives the most measurable snowfall.]]Inland, the average January overnight low is around {{convert|32|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in Columbia and temperatures well below freezing in the Upstate. While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state, the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer, while inland, the spring and autumn transitions tend to be the wettest periods and winter the driest season, with November being the driest month. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|113|F|C}} in [[Johnston, South Carolina|Johnston]] and Columbia on June 29, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-19|F|C}} at [[Caesars Head]] on January 21, 1985.

Snowfall in South Carolina is minimal in the lower elevation areas south and east of Columbia. It is not uncommon for areas along the southernmost coast to not receive measurable snowfall for several years. In the Piedmont and Foothills, especially along and north of Interstate 85, measurable snowfall occurs one to three times in most years. Annual average total amounts range from 2 to 6 inches. The Blue Ridge Escarpment receives the most average total measurable snowfall; amounts range from 7 to 12 inches.

South Carolina averages around 50 days of [[thunderstorm]] activity a year. This is less than some of the states further south, and it is slightly less vulnerable to [[tornado]]es than the states which border on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina, and the state averages around 14 tornadoes annually. [[Hail]] is common with many of the thunderstorms in the state, as there is often a marked contrast in temperature of warmer ground conditions compared to the cold air aloft.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif NOAA National Climatic Data Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=October 16, 2011 }}.

====Hurricanes and tropical cyclones====
[[File:Hugo 1989-09-21 1900Z.png|thumb|Category 4 Hurricane Hugo in 1989]]
The state is occasionally affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s. This is an annual concern during hurricane season, which lasts from June{{nbsp}}1 to November 30. The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October, during the [[Cape Verde hurricane]] season. Memorable [[hurricane]]s to hit South Carolina include [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] (1954), [[Hurricane Hugo|Hugo]] (1989), and [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]] (2018).

==== Climate change ====
{{Excerpt|Climate change in South Carolina}}South Carolina released its Climate, Energy, and Commerce Committee Final Report in 2008. The report recommends a voluntary economy-wide goal of reducing emissions to 5% below 1990 levels by 2020. Key policy recommendations in the report include developing renewable portfolio standards, increasing use of local agricultural products, and increasing advanced recycling and composting.

===Flora and fauna===
{{Further|List of mammals of South Carolina}}South Carolina is home to two dominant ecosystems, the bottomlands, which consist of floodplains and creeks, and the toplands. The floodplains contain large tracts of old and mature second growth cypress and tupelo forest. The uplands are home to longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, and mixed hardwood forests.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=The "Green Heart of South Carolina" Beats in the Congaree Biosphere Region (U.S. National Park Service) |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/cong-br.htm |access-date=2022-06-19 |website=www.nps.gov |language=en}}</ref> The Longleaf Pine are an important part of South Carolina's coastal ecosystem. They improve soil, water, and air quality while providing a habitat for deer and songbirds.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Longleaf Pine Initiative in South Carolina |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/sc/programs/landscape/?cid=nrcs142p2_015547 |url-status=dead |website=Natural Resources Conservation Service South Carolina |access-date=June 19, 2022 |archive-date=July 1, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220701193933/https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/sc/programs/landscape/?cid=nrcs142p2_015547 }}</ref> These forests are endangered by logging for agriculture and development.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=April 4, 2022 |title=South Carolina Wants You To Recycle Your Empty Oyster Shells |url=https://www.saveur.com/food/south-carolina-oyster-sustainability/ |access-date=2022-06-19 |website=Saveur |language=en-US}}</ref>

Oysters are a critical part of South Carolina's coastal ecology. They serve a dual function, filtering the water and forming reefs that provide a habitat for small fish and crabs. Oysters are imperiled by overharvesting because young oysters need older oysters to latch on to as they age.<ref name=":1" /> South Carolina is home to many shorebirds including various [[sandpiper]]s and [[ibis]]es.<ref>{{Cite web |title=White Ibis |url=https://www.southcarolinapublicradio.org/show/naturenotes/2021-08-20/white-ibis |access-date=2022-06-19 |website=South Carolina Public Radio |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=SCDNR - Coastal Birds in South Carolina - Shorebirds |url=https://www.dnr.sc.gov/wildlife/species/coastalbirds/shorebirds/index.html |access-date=2022-06-19 |website=www.dnr.sc.gov}}</ref> The state serves as a stopover site for birds migrating farther south and a wintering ground for birds that do not fly as far south.<ref name=":2" />
