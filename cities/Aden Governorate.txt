Aden was under [[United Kingdom|British]] rule in the period from 1839 to 1967. In 1967, after years of struggle, Aden and other southern governorates gained their independence. The city of Aden subsequently became the capital of [[South Yemen]] between 1967 and 1990. In 1990, both South Yemen and [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]] combined to form the present Republic of Yemen. Aden is now the commercial capital of the Republic of Yemen.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}
