Chhatarpur was founded in 1785 and is named after leader [[Maharaja Chhatrasal|Chhatrasal]], the founder of [[Bundelkhand]], and contains his [[cenotaph]]. The state was ruled by his descendants until 1785. At that time the [[Ponwar]] clan of the [[Rajput]]s took control of Chhatarpur.  The state was guaranteed to [[Kunwar Sone Singh Ponwar]]<ref>[http://uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/ips/c/chhatarpur.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623182153/http://uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/ips/c/chhatarpur.html|date=23 June 2008}}</ref> in 1806 by the [[British Raj]].
In 1854 Chhatarpur would have lapsed to the British government for want of direct heirs under the [[doctrine of lapse]], but was conferred on Jagat Raj as a special act of grace.<ref name="EB1911"/>  The [[Pawar|Ponwar]] Rajas ruled a [[princely state]] with an area of {{convert|1118|sqmi|km2}}, and population of 156,139 in 1901, which was part of the Bundelkhand agency of [[Central India Agency|Central India]].
