The city was founded in 1914 by Russian settlers immediately after the creation of the [[Uryankhay Krai]] (a protectorate of the Russian Empire), and called Belotsarsk.
{{quote|quote=
In the center of the Uryankhay region, at the confluence of the two Yenisei, the Big and Small, on a large elevated plain, I have designed the administrative center of the region, the future city of Belottsarsk. This name was given in honor of the Sovereign Leader of the Russian people, known to the Uryankhs under the name "Tsagan-Khan", which means [[White Tsar]] ...
| source = Vladimir Gabaev, head of the Russian population in Tuva <ref>"History of the city in the Center of Asia" v.1 (1914-1944) -Siberian Book Publishing House, 2013</ref>}}
In 1918, in connection with the communist revolution and the anti-tsarist movement, it was renamed to Hem-Beldir ([[Tuvinian language|Tuv.:]] ''confluence of rivers''), and in 1926, to Kyzyl ([[Tuvinian language|Tuv.:]] ''red'').

Between 1921 and 1944, the city was the capital of [[Tuvan People's Republic]]. From 1944 to 1961, it was the capital of the RSFSR's [[Tuvan Autonomous Oblast]]. From 1961 to 1991, it was the capital of the [[Tuvan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tuvan ASSR]], and since 1991, the capital of the [[Tuva|Republic of Tyva]].

Settlers began to lay a new city in the village of Vilany. Technological engineer K.V. Goguntsov and [[Topography|topographer]] M. Ya. Kryuchkov arrived in February 1914. Kryuchkov drew a general plan of the city of Belotsarsk (fund 123, inventory 2, file 21), which can still be seen in the layout of central Kyzyl today. The city plan enumerated the land plots and named their owners. In May 1914, the head of the Russian population in Uryankhai approved the draft rules on the allotment of land plots and the organization of a committee for the improvement of the future city. The very first plots were allocated for houses of officials, administration, homes of honorary Uryankhs, a treasury, post and telegraph offices, and the state fire shed.

The city was built by recruited workers from Krasnoyarsk, Minusinsk, Tomsk, and other cities of Siberia; Tuvan farm laborers; and Russian workers who fled from gold mines because of difficult working and living conditions.

On 4 July 1915, the Commissioner for the Uryankhay Krai, V. Yu. Grigoriev, wrote a letter to the Head of the Russian population in the Uryankhay Krai, requesting that a museum be constructed in the city of Belotsarsk (fund 123, inventory 2, file 53, sheets 25–26).<ref>newspaper "Plus Inform", No. 23, June 10, 2009, article "Belotsarsk-Uryankhaisk-Krasny-Kyzyl"</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = State Archives of the Republic of Tuva | title = History of the city in the Center of Asia | editor = R.M. Archimaeva | edition = Siberian book publishing house }}</ref>

At the IV Uryankhay Regional Congress on March 11, 1918, a decree was issued to rename Belotsarsk to Uryankhaysk. However, this name did not stick, as many still called the city Belotsarsk.

The Revolution of 1917 did not leave the city unscathed. During a major battle between the detachment of P.E. Schetinkin and A.D. Kravchenko (communist forces) and the Kolchak men (tsarist forces) under the command of the captain G.K. Bologov at the end of August 1919, the city was almost completely burned down. The 10th Congress of Representatives of the Russian Population of Tuva (16–20 September 1920) gathered in the village of Turan, in the Uryankhai region. At this Congress, participants decided to restore the city and rename it as Kyzyl.

On 13 August 1921, in the town of Sug-Bazhy (the village of Kochetovo), the Vsetuvinsky Constituent Khural of Representatives of all Khoshuns (khoshun was an administrative-territorial unit at that time) of Tuva gathered. This gathering proclaimed the creation of an independent state – the Tuvan People's Republic. In March 1922, the Tuvan government, the Central Committee of the [[Tuvan People's Revolutionary Party]] (Central Committee of the TPRP), and the executive committee of the Russian Self-Governing Labor Colony (RSTK) were transferred to the restored Kyzyl. In the spring of 1922, the city of Kyzyl became the capital of the Tuvan People's Republic (TPR).

In 1924, the Tuvan Central Cooperative (Tuvintsenkoop, TCC) was formed, which played a significant role in the development of industrial production and domestic and foreign trade. In 1925, the Tuvan National Bank (Tuvinbank) was founded. In Kyzyl, enterprises for the processing of agricultural raw materials were organized, and in 1928, a shoemaker's workshop opened. In 1929, the Kyzyl printing house was opened, and the transport organization "Soyuztrans" was created. Two years later, the Soyuztrans truck fleet consisted of 31 vehicles. In 1931, a telephone exchange for 30 subscribers was opened in the city of Kyzyl. Between 1930 and 1931 a sausage workshop, a pimokatny (a felt workshop), and tailoring workshop were built. In the early 1940s, a mill, a sawmill, a power station and a brick factory operated in Kyzyl, and sheepskin and fur production began.<ref>{{cite book | author = State Archives of the Tyva Republic | title = History of the city in the Center of Asia | editor = R.M.

==Geography==
[[File:Азий Диптиң Төвү-2014.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Renowned obelisk "The Center of Asia" (2014)]]
Kyzyl claims to be located exactly in the [[Geographical midpoint of Asia|geographical center of Asia]]. This claim is disputed.{{efn|[[Ürümqi]] in China makes a similar claim.}} Nevertheless, locals constructed a monument labelled "Center of Asia" in Tuvan, Russian, and English. [[Tos-Bulak]] is an area of open fields and mineral springs which lies immediately south of Kyzyl.

Kyzyl stands at the point where the [[Great Yenisey]] (Bii-Xem) meets the [[Little Yenisey]] (Kaa-Xem) river to form the [[Yenisey]] proper (Ulug-Xem).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046595/Kyzyl|title= Kyzyl|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date= 2007-07-30}}</ref> Most development takes place south of the Yenisey and Little Yenisey and follows the curve of the river, with the highest development centered just below the confluence of the Great Yenisey with the Little Yenisey. A monument was built in 1964 on the riverbank to mark this point.{{clarify|date=October 2019}}

===Climate===
The climate of Kyzyl has a [[Semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid]] variety ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk''), bordering on [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwb''), with average highs around {{convert|25|C|disp=or}} in the summer and {{convert|-20|C|disp=or}} in the winter and only {{convert|218|mm|in|2|disp=or}} of precipitation annually. Located far from any moderating bodies of water and at a relatively high latitude, temperatures can be extreme, though less so than in the [[Sakha Republic]]. Nevertheless, the temperature has never risen above freezing between 22 November and 19 February. On the 20th of February, 2021, the temperature rose to above freezing for the first time in recorded history. Temperature swings can be rapid. The transitional seasons of spring and autumn are short. Only April and October average close to the annual mean of {{convert|-1.2|C|F}}.

Kyzyl's climate is dry and sharply continental. Kyzyl's low altitude contributes to its extreme cold. In winter, the air in the basin stagnates and cools under the influence of the Siberian anticyclone, forming a powerful temperature inversion. Winter (November to March) is exceptionally harsh for the city's latitude (Kyzyl is located at the same latitude as London, Kursk and Orenburg), snow-free (10-20 cm), and windless. The average temperature in January is -28.7 °C (absolute minimum at -54&nbsp;°C). The city is among the 10 coldest cities in Russia and the world. Spring is short. The daytime thaws that begin in March lead to a rapid decline of snow cover by the end of the month. However, even in April, the temperature can drop at night to -27.3 °C due to sudden arctic winds.

In May, hot weather quickly sets in, with occasional prolonged droughts. Summer in Kyzyl begins in mid-May and ends in mid-September. In summer, the city is characterized by high daytime temperature. The maximum temperature is one of the highest in the Russian Federation, and is among the ten hottest cities, at 40.7 °C. Precipitation is more common in the summer. Dust storms are possible in May and July. In August, heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms are not uncommon. In late September, the first frosts are observed, although the weather is still quite hot during the day. Trees lose their leaves in the beginning of October, and a rapid decrease in average temperatures begins. At the end of October, before the snow cover is established, the average daily temperature drops below 0 °C, which makes it impossible to grow winter crops, and many fruits and berries. Snow cover is usually established in mid-November, followed by a sharp drop in temperatures to -20 °C and below.

Since the center of the Asian maximum atmospheric pressure (Siberian anticyclone) is located above Tuva in the cold season, and Kyzyl is located at the bottom of a deep basin (compared to the mountains surrounding it) with a dense atmosphere, up to the level of planetary winds to heights of 2 to 2.5 km, in winter a powerful inversion is observed over the city. The temperature at an altitude of 2 km above the city can be 15 to 20 degrees higher than at the surface of the earth. Almost from the end of October to the beginning of March, there is windless, often clear weather, leading to strong smog gathering over the city and the basin. On some days, visibility can drop to 500-1000 meters due to the smog. Severe air pollution in winter is a substantial environmental concern. The government of the region is currently seeking to build [[gasification]] infrastructure to combat this.

The record high of {{convert|40.7|C|disp=or}} was recorded on 15 July 2004. The record low of {{convert|-54.0|C|disp=or}} was recorded on 4 February 1945.

===Sights===
====Center of Asia – Sculpture Complex====
The obelisk, symbolizing the center of Asia, is located on the bank of the [[Yenisei]] River. Three versions have been built — in 1964, 1984 and 2014. 

The new obelisk was designed by the Buryat artist [[Dashi Namdakov]]. It is represented by an ensemble of three lions holding a globe topped with a spire. Externally, the monument is very similar to the previous obelisks. It depicts grandiose figures of eastern dragons and a high stele, surrounded by symbolic animals intertwined in a rush of ascent to the sky. The animal figures also represent the twelve creatures of the Buddhist horoscope.

====Ethnic and cultural complex of Aldyn-Bulak====

The complex occupies the coastal zone of the [[Yenisei]], 45&nbsp;km from Kyzyl. The installation was built as a model of the universe, where the roles of stars and planets are assigned to yurts of different sizes and purposes. Although the yurts are decorated as authentic as possible to the Uralic way of life, Aldyn-Bulak has all the amenities, including places for tourists to stay, a restaurant, a sauna, a parking lot.

====Tsechenling Temple====

One of the most important Buddhist attractions of Kyzyl. Built in 1998, it consists of two floors: the first – as a residence, the second – for prayer. The corners of the building appear worn, due to the tradition of walking around the temple in a circle and touching the corners. Classes on spiritual practices and languages are held inside. Admission is free.

====Buddhist Prayer Wheel====
The wheel was officially opened in 2006. It is considered the largest prayer wheel in Russia. It came from an Indian monastery, where the monks worked on the wheel for several years. Millions of scrolls with mantras are stacked inside.

====Kadarchy Monument====

It was installed in 1997 in front of the Kyzyl Airport. The monument is a shepherd with a staff in traditional Tuvan clothing. After the sculpture took its place on the hill, the locals considered that the hero did not have enough liverstock, so "sheep" were placed nearby in the form of boulders painted white.

====Mineral spring - "Bobry"====
The spring is located {{convert|2|km|mi|1|disp=or}} from Kyzyl. The name is translated to English as "beavers". According to legend, people learned about the spring from the beavers who went there to drink. There are more than 20 streams and springs, and the water is collected in small natural and handmade bowls or spreads. It is also said that, since each of the streams treats different diseases, tourists should try the water from all of them.
