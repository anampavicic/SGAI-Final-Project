[[File:Provincial Geographies of India Volume 2 0013.jpg|thumb|left|Provincial map of Bengal showing Greater Mymensingh Area (present [[Mymensingh Division]] with Tangail and Kishoreganj) in 1917]]
Mymensingh is one of the sixteen old districts of Bangladesh which was constituted by the [[British East India Company]] on 1 May 1787.<ref>Jaffar Ahmed Chowdhury, ''Moymonsingha'', (Bengali), 2004/2006, p. 13, p. 30-31, Silicon Plaza, Apartment 5A, House 31A, Uttara, Dhaka, {{ISBN|984-32-1057-3}}</ref> Being more than 220 years old, Mymensingh has a rich cultural and political history.

A second spell of exodus took place following the Indo-Pak war of 1965.  Many people born and raised Mymensingh have left for West Bengal since the 1960s. The exodus continues albeit at a slower pace.

From the early 20th century Muslims moved into town. Since then this city has played an important role as a centre for secularism. The [[Vidyamoyee Govt. Girls' High School|Vidyamoyee Uccha Balika Bidyalaya]] and [[Muminunnesa Govt. Women's College|Muminunnesa Women's College]] have played a great role in educating Bengali Muslim women. A majority of first-generation successful Bangladeshi women have attended these schools and colleges, including the first woman justice of the High Court of Bangladesh, Justice [[Nazmun Ara Sultana]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/767801.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=First woman in Bangladesh high court |date=28 May 2000 |access-date=19 May 2010 |archive-date=22 July 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040722163045/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/767801.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> On 1 December 1969, Tangail subdivision was separated from Mymensingh and a new District of Tangail was formed.

== Economy ==
[[File:Hotel Al-Rifat in Chorpara Mymensingh.JPG|thumb|right|Hotel Al-Rifat in Chorpara Mymensingh]]

Historically, Mymensingh district was known for [[jute]] production which was termed 'golden fibre' due to revenue it generated as a cash crop.  Due to the high demand for [[polythene bag]]s and other economic reasons, the jute industry has significantly declined. As Mymensingh is the capital of Mymensingh Division, government employees make up a large percentage of the city's workforce. Mymensingh also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled labour population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, Rickshaw pullers, taxi drivers, mechanics and other such professions. Agriculture is the most important sector contributing to GDP, followed by the growing service sector in the city. The increasing demand for fish in the local and global markets has generated a new opportunity for local fishermen as well as businessmen to exploit fishing in Mymensingh, and today it is very important to the economy. People have changed their paddy fields to ponds and are cultivating fish. [[Prawns]], sometimes reaching a very large size in the winter, are sold in Mymensingh in great numbers.

The entire area between Durgabari Road, and Maharaja Road comprises the traditional shopping area. There are places like Ganginarpar, Boro Bazaar, Choto Bazaar, Mechua Bazaar within this area. There are spots like Jilapi Patty which is for making and selling jilapi. The main road from Notunbazar to the railway station & C.K. Ghosh Road to Charpara hosts a number of shops for manufactured products and clothing.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Chinese restaurant in Mymensingh.JPG|thumb|right|Chinese restaurant in Mymensingh]]
The staple food is plain rice with a [[curry]] of fish or meat. Normally people start with fried or steamed vegetable and [[dal]], a kind of [[lentil]] soup.  Often people squeeze a citron slice or take additional salt while eating and add fresh [[shallots]] and [[capsicum|green pepper]] as seasoning. Traditional snacks and savouries include seasonal [[pitha]] of various kinds, ''dal-puri'', and [[samosa|shingara]]. Home made desserts include [[Kheer|Khyr]], ''Payesh'' and ''Shemai''. Sweets soaked in syrup of sugar, such as ''Jilapi'', are mostly bought from shops. [[Paan|Pan]], a digestive made out of [[betel nut]]s, spices, tobacco, and certain other ingredients are eaten by many people, some of which consume it with aromatic ''Dzorda''. For dinner or lunch, a simple formula is to prepare "[[khichdi|khichuri]]", the broth of rice and lentils, seasoned with spices, and served with [[chutney]] or [[pickling|pickles]]. [[Ghee]] (butter) may be spread just before eating. The meal may end with sweet [[curd]]. [[Muri (food)|Muri]] (puffed rice), [[Assamese Jolpan#Chira|chira]] (flattened rice) and [[khoi]] (popped rice) are substitutes for rice. They are eaten with [[Jaggery|gur]] ([[jaggery]]) which is a kind of unrefined sugar. They may be mixed with yogurt or milk before eaten.<ref name="Iffat Ara"/> People use only the right hand for eating.
