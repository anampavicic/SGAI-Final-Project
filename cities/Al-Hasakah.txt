On 23 March 1993, a large fire broke out in the [[Al-Hasakah Central Prison]] after prisoners protested the conditions there, leaving 61 inmates dead and 90 others injured. The detainees accused the police chief and the [[Syrian forces]] of having set the fire. The government blamed five inmates, who were then executed on 24 May 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vdc-nsy.com/archives/44999|title = بعد 28 عاماً على حريق سجن الحسكة أهالي 61 ضحية مازالوا بانتظار تحقيق العدالة|date = 25 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad5620.html|title = Refworld &#124; Syria: Whether a fire was set at Hasaka prison on 24 March 1993 killing around 60 people}}</ref>

In January 2021, Al-Hasakh, along with [[Qamishli]], [[Siege of Qamishli and Al-Hasakah|came under siege]] by the Asayish due to disputes with the Damascus government.

On 20 January 2022, the al-Sina'a prison [[Battle of al-Hasakah (2022)|came under attack]] by Islamic State forces who attempted to free ex-IS fighters that were incarcerated inside the prison. Following the initial attack, clashes spread to the neighbourhoods of al-Zuhour and Ghuwayran. After a 6-day battle, SDF and Coalition forces managed to push back the attack and secure the area. After thwarting their attack on Ghweran prison, they barricaded themselves in the Faculty of Economics building in the Syrian government-controlled areas in the city of Hasaka, targeting civilians and the movements of the internal security forces' vehicles. Accordingly, international coalition warplanes bombed the college building.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Coalition warplanes bombs building, group of ISIS cells holed up in Al-Hasakah - ANHA {{!}} HAWARNEWS {{!}} English|url=http://hawarnews.com/en/haber/coalition-warplanes-bombs-building-group-of-isis-cells-holed-up-in-al-hasakah-h28775.html|access-date=2022-01-29|website=hawarnews.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2022-01-21|title=Ghuwayran prison attack {{!}} International Coalition jets attack building ISIS holed up in Al-Hasakah • The Syrian Observatory For Human Rights|url=https://www.syriahr.com/en/235578/|access-date=2022-01-29|website=The Syrian Observatory For Human Rights|language=en-US}}</ref>
