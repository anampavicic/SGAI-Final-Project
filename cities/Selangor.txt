== Etymology ==
The origin of the name ''Selangor'' is uncertain. A common suggestion is that the name refers to the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''langau'', a large fly or [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]] that is found in the marshes along the [[Selangor River]] (Sungai Selangor) in the state's north-west. According to local lore, a warrior who escaped from [[Malacca]] after the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Portuguese conquest]], took a break from his journey north and rested under a tree here. However, he was disturbed by a persistent fly, whereupon he decided to explore the area. When he found the place to his liking and chose to settle there, he named the place "satu (se) langau" meaning "a large blowfly".<ref name="kuala selangor council">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdks.gov.my/en/visitors/kuala-selangor-info/page/0/2 |title= Kuala Selangor Info: Page 3 of 4: Oral History |work= Kuala Selangor District Council |date= 6 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803134041/http://www.mdks.gov.my/en/visitors/kuala-selangor-info/page/0/2 |archive-date=3 August 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://says.com/my/lifestyle/the-origins-of-state-names-in-malaysia |title=The Stories And Facts Behind How The 13 States of Malaysia Got Their Names|author= Tang Ruxyn|date= 26 April 2017 |work= Says}}</ref>

In the absence of a firm etymological explanation, alternative theories abound.  One suggestion is that the name may have originated from a kind of tree found in [[Kuala Selangor]] and along [[Selangor River]] named ''mentangau''.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208140351/http://www.mdks.gov.my/ms/pelawat/info-kuala-selangor/page/0/2 |archive-date=8 December 2016 |url=http://www.mdks.gov.my/ms/pelawat/info-kuala-selangor/page/0/2 |title=Info Kuala Selangor: Halaman 3 dari 4 - Cerita-Cerita Lisan|work=Majlis Daerah Kuala Selangor |date=6 January 2016 }}</ref> Another theory claims the state's name is derived from the term ''Salang Ur'' where ''ur'' means "town" or "village" in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], meaning village of the Salang people.<ref name="kuala selangor council"/> It has also been proposed that the name is derived from a combination of ''salang'' (stabbing) and ''jemur'' (dry in the sun), indicating that it was once a place where traitors were stabbed (''salang'') then left to roast in the sun (''jemur'').<ref name="kuala selangor council"/>

After the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|fall of Malacca]] to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in 1511, the area came under the control of [[Johor Sultanate]] and was later governed by Sri Agar Diraja, son of the [[Bendahara]] family of Johor.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Malaysia and Singapore |author=Tan Ding Eing|page=81 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= 1975  |isbn= 978-0195807226}}</ref> In the 17th century, Johor was involved in a war against [[Jambi]], and the Sultan of Johor engaged the help of [[Bugis]] mercenaries from [[Sulawesi]] to fight against Jambi.<ref name="tan">{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Malaysia and Singapore |author=Tan Ding Eing |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1978|isbn=978-0195807226|page=22 }}</ref> After Johor won, the Bugis stayed and started to gain power in the region.<ref name="baker">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRaJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA65 | title=Crossroads (2nd Edn): A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore |author= Jim Baker| publisher=Marshall Cavendish International (Asia) Pte Ltd|isbn=978-9814516020 |pages=64–65 | date=15 July 2008 }}</ref> Initially there were only a few hundred Bugis who settled in the estuaries of the Selangor and Klang rivers as well as Linggi further south in the early 17th century, later when the Bugis had gained position of influence in Johor (the Bugis were given the position of Yam Tuan Muda having helped repel an attack from [[Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura|Siak]]), much larger number settled in Selangor by 1723.

In the 19th century, the economy of Selangor boomed due to the exploitation of its tin reserves; mining occurred in various parts of Selangor, for example in [[Ampang, Kuala Lumpur|Ampang]], that led to the growth of [[Kuala Lumpur]]. In 1854, the Sultan of Selangor granted Raja Abdullah control of [[Klang District|Klang]], passing over Raja Mahdi, the son of the chief who previously ruled Klang, which led to the [[Selangor Civil War]] fought between 1867 and 1874. The war between the Malay factions was also partly a struggle for control of the tin revenue.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857-1939 |author= J.M. Gullick |publisher=Eastern Universities Press (M) |pages=17–18 |year=1983 |isbn=978-9679080285}}</ref> Tin mining had attracted a large number of Chinese migrant labourers, and Chinese clans allied with Selangor chiefs also joined the civil war. The conflicts between Malay and Chinese factions in Perak and Selangor, as well as concerns over piracy that affected coastal trade, led to increasing British involvement in the affairs of the Malay states.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yookbQZ-0yUC&pg=PA139|title= South East Asia, Colonial History: Peaceful transitions to independence (1945-1963)|author= Paul H.

In 1874, Sultan [[Abdul Samad of Selangor]] accepted a [[British Resident]] in a system that allowed the British to govern while the Sultan remained the apparent ruler. Klang was the capital of the British colonial administration of Selangor from 1875 until 1880 when it was moved to Kuala Lumpur. Under the stability imposed by the British, Selangor again prospered. In 1896, largely through the coordination of the Resident [[Frank Swettenham]], Selangor united with [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Perak]] and [[Pahang]] to form the [[Federated Malay States]], with [[Kuala Lumpur]] as its capital.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Benfield|first1=H.

The Federated Malay States evolved into the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1948, which became independent in 1957.

==Geography==
[[File:Titiwangsa Mountains from Ulu Yam.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Titiwangsa Mountains]] in [[Ulu Yam]]]]

Selangor, with an area of approximately 8,000&nbsp;km², extends to the [[Peninsular Malaysia#Other features|west coast]] of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The state is bordered north by [[Bernam River]] from [[Perak]], south by [[Sepang River]] from [[Negeri Sembilan]], east and southeast by the [[Titiwangsa Mountains]] from [[Pahang]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]] and the [[Strait of Malacca]] on the west, and surrounds the [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]] of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Putrajaya]].  

[[File:Klang River - panoramio.jpg|249px|thumb|[[Klang River]], [[Klang (city)|Klang]]]]

Topographically wise, Selangor is relatively level near the coast and gradually become more hilly and mountainous towards the east. The hill and mountain, surrounding the eastern and central portion of the state effectively forming a valley and a drainage basin of the [[Klang River]], known as the [[Klang Valley]], where most of the population are centered. The Klang Valley is often synonymously associated with another toponym, [[Greater Kuala Lumpur]], though both terms vary between each other. Being one of the most heavily urbanized regions in Malaysia and Southeast Asia, cities that make up Klang Valley include the state and royal capitals of [[Shah Alam]] and [[Klang (city)|Klang]], as well as the federal capital, [[Kuala Lumpur]], which is strategically situated in the heart of the state. It was once part of Selangor territory before it was [[1974 Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur Agreement|ceded to the federal government]] in 1974 to form a [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]]. It was then followed by the 1995 cession of [[Prang Besar]] of Sepang District to the federal government, which became what is now the nation's administrative and judicial capital [[Putrajaya]].

Selangor is divided into nine districts namely [[Sabak Bernam District|Sabak Bernam]], [[Kuala Selangor District|Kuala Selangor]], [[Hulu Selangor]], [[Petaling District|Petaling]], [[Klang District|Klang]], [[Kuala Langat District|Kuala Langat]], [[Hulu Langat District|Hulu Langat]] and [[Sepang District|Sepang]].

Selangor is Malaysia's most populous state; it has the nation's biggest [[conurbation]], the [[Klang Valley]].

The first MRT line covers a span of 46 kilometres from Kwasa Damansara to Kajang, passing the Kuala Lumpur city centre where the alignment goes underground. The line will be serving a corridor with 1.2 million residents within the Klang Valley region from north-west to the south-east of Kuala Lumpur. The line starts from Kwasa Damansara which is located to the north-west of Kuala Lumpur, which runs on an elevated guideway to the Semantan portal, passing through Kota Damansara, Bandar Utama, Seksyen 17 and Damansara Town Centre. Kwasa Damansara provides a [[cross-platform interchange]] between the SBK line and Sungai Buloh–Serdang–Putrajaya line (SSP line). The line continues in twin-bore tunnels to the Maluri portal, passing through the city centre and the Golden Triangle of Kuala Lumpur. Interchange to other lines is provided from Muzium Negara to Maluri with the exception of Cochrane in the Kuala Lumpur city.
