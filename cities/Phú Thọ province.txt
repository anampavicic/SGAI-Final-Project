Đền Hùng is a national historical location where the Vietnamese give their respects to Hung kings because of their contributions to the country 4000 years ago.

===Hung Kings temple complex===
Hung Kings Temple, located on Nghĩa Lĩnh Mountain, 175 meters by sea level in [[Việt Trì]] city, is a complex of majestic architectures encompassing the Hạ Temple, the Thiền Quang pagoda, the Giếng, Trung and Thuong temples, and King Hung's tomb. The Hạ temple was built in the 15th century and is approached from the Dai Mon Gate. There is also a 700-year-old tree in front of this temple. The legend narrated to this temple is that Âu Cơ gave birth to 100 children. Her husband, Lạc Long Quân, led 50 of the children to the coastal region and settled them to propagate his race. Âu Cơ took 49 children up to the mountainous area. The eldest among these children became Hùng king and renamed the country [[Văn Lang]] and made Phong Châu its capital.<ref name=path/>

The Thuong Temple is approached from Trung Temple over a pathway, which has 102 brick steps. The kings worshipped the Sun God, the Earth God, the Rice God, and Saint Dong. At this temple location, the last ruler of the 18th Hung dynasty handed the reins of his kingdom to [[Thục Phán]], who established a memorial stone pillar and took an oath that he would maintain the temple and also the inheritance of the Hung's family. King Hung's tomb is the tomb of a ruler of the 6th Hung dynasty. It is claimed the 6th dynasty Hung king, after defeating the intruders to his country, removed his dress and hung them on the branch of the ''kim giao'' tree. He soon after died right at that location. Giếng Temple is at the foot of the mountain where an 18th dynasty king's daughters, Ngọc Hoa and Tiên Dung, worshipped. They used their reflection in the water surface of the well to manicure their hair.<ref name=path/>
