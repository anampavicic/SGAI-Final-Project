==Geography and topography==
Sonipat is located at {{Coord|28.98|N|77.02|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/10/Sonipat.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Sonipat, India|website=www.fallingrain.com}}</ref>

The district headquarter is situated in Sonipat. Other smaller towns are Gohana, Ganaur, Mundlana, Kharkhoda and Rai. The total area of Sonipat district is 2,260 km<sup>2</sup> and its population is 10,64,000. Sonipat is bordered by the states of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as well as the districts of Rohtak, Jind and Panipat. The River Yamuna runs along the eastern boundary of the district

District Sonepat comprises four sub-divisions, namely Ganaur, Sonepat, Kharkhoda and Gohana and eight blocks (Ganaur, Sonipat, Rai, Kharkhoda, Gohana, Kathura, Murthal  and Mundlana) has been carved out of Rohtak and made a full-fledged district on 22 December 1972. Sonepat is the largest tehsil followed by Gohana. It has one Municipal Corporation Sonipat and three municipal committees Ganaur, Gohana and Kharkhoda.

the Haryana Main water system in the district consists of the River Yamuna and the irrigation canals flowing out of it. There is no perennial river in the district. The underground water resources differ from area to area. The depth of the water table is the lowest in the Khader area along the Yamuna, where it is below 10&nbsp;ft. It increases to 30 to 40&nbsp;ft. in some of the western and south eastern part of the district. The ground water in some areas is saline and brackish. The ground water conditions indicate that the district faces the problem of occurrence of brackish water and water logging in eastern parts of the district.

Broadly speaking, the district is a continuous part of the Haryana-Punjab plain, but the area is not leveled in some parts. Over most of the district, the soil is fine loam of rich color. However, some areas have sandy soil and others are composed of Kallar. The plain has a gradual slope to the south and east. The district may be roughly divided into three regions:

# '''The Khadar''' Along the River Yamuna is a narrow flood plain, three to six kilometres wide, and is formed by the river along its course. The Khader plain is 20 to 30 feet lower, adjoining upland plain. It is composed of fine clay loam left by the receding floods of the Yamuna. Currently, rice and sugar cane cultivation is undertaken by the farmers in the Khadar area. Recently, the farmers have started planting Banana, Pappaya and other fruits trees.
# '''The Upland Plain''' It consists of Sonepat tehsil lying to the west of the Khadar, and is the most extensive of the three regions: The Upland Plain is covered with old alluvium, which if properly irrigated, is highly productive. Extensive Farming of crops, oil seeds, horticultural plants, vegetables and flowers, is undertaken in this region. The ridges in Gohana tehsil represent the northern most extension of the Aravallis.
# '''The Sandy Region''' A very smaller part of the district is covered with soil consisting of sand or sandy loam. Parts of this region has high PH value leading to kallor land.

===Soil Profile===

District Sonepat, comprising Sonepat, Gohana and Ganaur sub divisions, has 343 villages and covers an area of 2,13,080 hectares. The irrigated area (both with the help of canal irrigation as well as through tubewells) is 2,86,504 acres and the un-irrigated rainfed area is 43,979 acres. Sonepat is an important saltpetre producing area. The saltpeter appears as efflorescence on the surface during the summer season, specially in the village of Sonepat sub-division.

Water logging is a serious problem effecting the productivity of land. The water logged area, which the water table is between 0 and 5&nbsp;ft, faces a serious problem. Where the water table is between 5 and 10&nbsp;ft., the problem of water logging is imminent. There has been an alarming rise in the water table during the last two decades, Specially in the areas adjoining the canals. This has led to appearance of Thur on the surface of soil, followed by sem in several parts of the district, specially the areas adjoining the Yamuna and minor canals running through the district.

The soil in Sonepat is rich and quite suitable for all types of agricultural crops as well as forest cover.

The types of soil may be classified according to textures as :

# Sandy (Raitali)
# Sandy loam (Bhuri)
# Loam (Rausli)
# Clay loam (Karti)
# Clay (Dakar)
