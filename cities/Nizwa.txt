'''Nizwa''' ({{langx|ar|نِزْوَى|Nizwā}}) is the largest city in [[Ad Dakhiliyah Region]] in Oman and was the capital of [[Imamate of Oman|Oman proper]]. Nizwa is about {{convert|140|km|mile|abbr=on}} (1.5 hour drive) from the Omani capital [[Muscat]]. The population is estimated at around 83,544 people.

Nizwa is one of the oldest cities in Oman, and was once a center of trade, religion, education and art. Its Jama (grand mosque) was formerly a center for Islamic learning. Nizwa acquired its importance because it has been an important meeting point at the base of the [[Western Hajar Mountains]]. Set amid a verdant spread of date palms, it is strategically located at the crossroads of routes linking the interior with Muscat and the lower reaches of [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]], thus serving as the link for a large part of the country. Today, Nizwa is a diverse prosperous place with numerous agricultural, historical and recreational aspects. Nizwa is a center for [[date palm|date]] growing and is the [[market town|market place]] for the area.

== Etymology ==
Historians cannot agree on the origins of the name of the city. Some suggest the name was derived from the Arabic verb ({{langx|ar|انزوا}}) which means being alone. Others say that the city was named after an old water spring.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

== History ==
{{See also|History of Oman|Wajihids}}
Nizwa was the capital of Oman in the 6th and 7th centuries AD. With its deep connection to the root of [[Islam]], Nizwa possesses a number of renowned mosques, such as [[Qaboos of Oman|Sultan Qaboos]] Jama (Friday mosque), So'al Mosque built in the 2nd century AH (9th century AD), Ash-Shawathinah Mosque in Uqr and Ash-Sharja Mosque. There are also Al-Ain Mosque, Ash-Sheikh Mosque and Shuraij Mosque in Tanuf built in 377 AH (around 1000 AD).{{cn|date=February 2023}}

A handwritten letter from the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] in 630 asked the locals of the mountain town of Nizwa to convert. The locals then sent a return delegation to [[Medina]] and embraced Islam. A tutor was sent by [[Muhammad]] to teach the new [[Muslims]] of Nizwa the fundamentals of the religion.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Krane |first=Jim |url=http://archive.org/details/dubaistoryofworl0000kran |title=Dubai: The Story of the World's Fastest City |publisher=Atlantic |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-84887-009-3 |location=London, England |pages=7 |language=en}}</ref>

The explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] visited in the 14th century, noting Nizwa as "a city at the foot of a mountain, enveloped by orchards and streams, and with fine bazaars and splendid clean mosques."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=98}}</ref>

In the early 1950s, the large round tower of the ancient fort built in the center of the town was bombed and rocketed by the [[British Empire|British]] [[Royal Air Force]], who were called in to assist the then-reigning [[Said bin Taimur|Sultan Said bin Taimur]] in suppressing a [[Jebel Akhdar War|revolt]] by leaders of the interior [[Imamate of Oman]].{{cn|date=January 2023}} The conflict was driven by a struggle for a share of Oman's newly discovered oil wealth.

Nizwa has become a more modern city since 1970 under the reign of [[Qaboos of Oman|Sultan Qaboos]].{{cn|date=January 2023}} Improvements include connections to Muscat via a two-lane highway, which has increased tourism.  Communications have been improved to include broadband access, and the city is home to a substantial hospital. It is also a hub for education including a technical college, College of Applied Sciences, The [[University of Nizwa]], and the training academy for the [[Royal Oman Police]]. There are now many hotels and tourism is promoted in the area.

[[File:Nizwa8.jpg|thumb|Nizwa's fort]]

Nizwa Fort was built in 1668 AD by [[Sultan bin Saif|Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi]], and today is Oman's most visited national monument. The fort was the administrative seat of authority for the presiding imams and walis in times of peace and conflict. The main bulk of the fort took about 12 years to complete and was built above an underground stream. The fort is a reminder of the town's significance through turbulent periods in Oman's long history. It was a formidable stronghold against raiding forces that desired Nizwa's abundant natural wealth and its strategic crossroads location.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}
