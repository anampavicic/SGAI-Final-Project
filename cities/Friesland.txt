It is situated west of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], northwest of [[Drenthe]] and [[Overijssel]], north of [[Flevoland]], northeast of [[North Holland]], and south of the [[Wadden Sea]]. As of January 2023, the province had a population of about 660,000,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table?ts=1581415402485 |title=CBS Statline |website=opendata.cbs.nl |access-date=11 February 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803035505/https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table?ts=1581415402485 |url-status=live}}</ref> and a total area of {{cvt|5,753|km2|sqmi}}.

The province is divided into 18 municipalities. The [[Capital city|capital]] and seat of the provincial government is the city of [[Leeuwarden]] (West Frisian: ''Ljouwert'', Liwwaddes: ''Liwwadde''), a city with 123,107<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table |title=CBS Statline |access-date=10 January 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803035505/https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table |url-status=live}}</ref> inhabitants. Other large municipalities in Friesland are [[Sneek]] (pop. 33,512), [[Heerenveen]] (pop. 50,257), and [[Smallingerland]] (includes town of [[Drachten]], pop. 55,938). Since 2017, [[Arno Brok]] is the [[King's Commissioner]] in the province. A coalition of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], and the [[Frisian National Party]] forms the executive branch. The area of the province was once part of the ancient, larger region of [[Frisia]], which gave the province its name. The land is mostly made up of [[grassland]] and it has numerous [[lake]]s. The official languages of Friesland are [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

==Toponymy==
In 1996, the [[Provincial Council of Friesland]] resolved that the official name of the province should follow the [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] spelling rather than the Dutch spelling, resulting in "Friesland" being replaced by "Fryslân".<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Provinciaal Blad van Friesland |date=28 March 1996 |title=Beslut fan Provinsjale Staeten van Friesland |trans-title=Resolution of the Provincial Council of Friesland |issue=7 |language=fy}}</ref> In 2004, the [[government of the Netherlands|Dutch government]] confirmed this resolution, putting in place a three-year scheme to oversee the name change and associated cultural programme.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Leeuwarder Courant]] |title=Ook voor rijk heet Friesland Fryslân |trans-title=Friesland to be called Fryslân across the realm |url=http://www.archiefleeuwardercourant.nl/vw/article.do?id=LC-20041110-17011 |date=10 November 2004 |access-date=11 August 2012 |language=nl |archive-date=22 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922022138/https://www.dekrantvantoen.nl//vw/article.do?id=LC-20041110-17011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
===Prehistory===
{{Main|Frisii}}
[[File:Continental.coast.150AD.Germanic.peoples.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the North Sea coast, {{Circa|150 AD}}. (erroneously shows late 20th century land masses)]]

The [[Frisii]] were among the migrating Germanic tribes that, following the breakup of Celtic Europe in the 4th century BC, settled along the North Sea. They came to control the area from roughly present-day [[Bremen]] to [[Bruges]], and conquered many of the smaller offshore islands. What little is known of the Frisii is provided by a few Roman accounts, most of them military. [[Pliny the Elder]] said their lands were forest-covered with tall trees growing up to the edge of the lakes.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Pliny the Elder|79_3|pp=340–341}}, ''Natural History'', Bk XVI Ch 2: Wonders connected with trees in the northern regions.</ref> They lived by agriculture<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=253}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XIII, Ch 54. Events of AD 54&ndash;58. This was confirmed by [[Tacitus]] when he said that in an incident where the Frisii had taken over land, they then settled into houses, sowed the fields, and cultivated the soil.</ref> and raising cattle.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=147–148}}, ''The Annals'', Bk IV, Ch 72&ndash;74. Events of AD 15&ndash;16. Tacitus specifically refers to the herds of the Frisii.</ref>

In his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Tacitus described all the Germanic peoples of the region as having elected kings with limited powers and influential military leaders who led by example rather than by authority. The people lived in spread-out settlements.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=18–19, 23–24, 36–37}}, ''The Germany'', Ch V, VII, XVI.</ref> He specifically noted the weakness of Germanic political hierarchies in reference to the Frisii, when he mentioned the names of two kings of the 1st century Frisii and added that they were kings "as far as the Germans are under kings".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=253}}, ''The Annals'', Bk XIII, Ch 54. Events of AD 54&ndash;58.</ref>

In the 1st century BC, the Frisii halted a Roman advance and thus managed to maintain their independence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |title=One Europe, many nations : a historical dictionary of European national groups |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2000 |page=264 |isbn=9780313309847}}</ref> Some or all of the Frisii may have joined into the Frankish and Saxon peoples in late Roman times, but they would retain a separate identity in Roman eyes until at least 296, when they were forcibly resettled as ''[[laeti]]''<ref name="Grane 2007 109">{{Citation |last=Grane |first=Thomas |year=2007 |contribution=From Gallienuso Probus - Three decades of turmoil and recovery |title=The Roman Empire and Southern Scandinavia&ndash;a Northern Connection!

The lands of the Frisii were largely abandoned by {{circa|400}} as a result of the conflicts of the [[Migration Period]], climate deterioration, and the flooding caused by a rise in the sea level.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Frisian Kingdom}}
[[File:Frisia 716-la.svg|thumb|The Frisian realm in 716 AD. The Frisian Kingdom covered only the western part of the area.]]

The area lay empty for one or two centuries, when changing environmental and political conditions made the region habitable again. At that time, during the Migration Period, "new" [[Frisians]] (probably descended from a merging of [[Frisii]], [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]) repopulated the coastal regions.<ref name="Bazelmans 2009 321–337">{{Harvcolnb|Bazelmans|2009|pp=321–337}}, ''The case of the Frisians''.</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite thesis |last=Halbertsma |first=Herrius |title=Frieslands Oudheid |language=nl, en |chapter=Summary |chapter-url=http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/arts/1982/h.halbertsma/Halbertsma.PDF |year=1982 |location=Groningen |publisher=Rijksuniversiteit Groningen |oclc=746889526 |pages=791–798 |access-date=22 June 2017 |archive-date=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001154120/http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/arts/1982/h.halbertsma/Halbertsma.PDF |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|page=792}} These Frisians consisted of tribes with loose bonds, centred on war bands but without great power.

Under the rule of King [[Aldgisl]], the Frisians came in conflict with the Frankish [[Mayor of the Palace|mayor of the palace]] [[Ebroin]], over the old Roman border fortifications. Aldgisl could keep the Franks at a distance with his army. During the reign of [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]], however, the tide turned in favour of the Franks; in 690, the Franks were victorious in the [[Battle of Dorestad]].<ref>{{cite book |location=Bussum |publisher=Fibula-Van Dishoeck |series=Fibulareeks |volume=22 |last=Blok |first=Dirk P. |title=De Franken : hun optreden in het licht der historie |language=nl |year=1968 |oclc=622919217 |pages=32–34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjTrAAAAMAAJ |access-date=17 September 2014 |archive-date=22 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922022128/https://books.google.com/books?id=YjTrAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live}}</ref> In 733, [[Charles Martel]] sent an army against the Frisians.

===Frisian freedom===
{{Main|Frisian freedom}}
[[File:Dapperheidgrotepier.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] in 1516 as depicted in a 19th-century painting by [[Johannes Hinderikus Egenberger]]]]

When, around 800, the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Vikings]] first attacked [[Frisia]], which was still under [[Carolingian]] rule, the Frisians were released from military service on foreign territory in order to be able to defend themselves against the heathen Vikings. With their victory in the [[Battle of Norditi]] in 884 they were able to drive the Vikings permanently out of [[East Frisia]], although it remained under constant threat. Over the centuries, whilst [[Feudalism|feudal lord]]s reigned in the rest of Europe, no aristocratic structures emerged in Frisia. This '[[Frisian freedom]]' was represented abroad by ''redjeven'' who were elected from among the wealthier farmers or from elected representatives of the autonomous rural municipalities. Originally the ''redjeven'' were all judges, so-called ''Asega'', who were appointed by the territorial lords.<ref>Heinrich Schmidt: ''Politische Geschichte Ostfrieslands.'' 1975, p. 22 ff.</ref>

After significant territories were lost to [[County of Holland|Holland]] in the [[Friso-Hollandic Wars]], Frisia saw an economic downturn in the mid-14th century. Accompanied by a decline in monasteries and other communal institutions, social discord led to the emergence of untitled nobles called ''haadlingen'' ("headmen"), wealthy landowners possessing large tracts of land and fortified homes<ref>Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia, John M. Deep, Pub. 2001, Germany.</ref> who took over the role of the judiciary as well as offering protection to their local inhabitants. Internal struggles between regional leaders resulted in bloody conflicts and the alignment of regions along two opposing parties: the [[Vetkopers and Schieringers|Fetkeapers and Skieringers]]. On 21 March 1498,<ref>Markus Meumann, Jörg Rogge (Hg.). Die besetzte "res publica".

In 1515, an army of haadlingen and peasants, with the help of mercenaries known as the [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop]], started a fight for freedom from oppression by the Habsburg authorities.<ref name="Wûnseradiel">{{cite web |url=http://www.wunseradiel.nl/index.php?simaction=content&pagid=289 |publisher=Gemeente Wûnseradiel |title=Greate Pier fan Wûnseradiel |language=fy |access-date=4 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907012626/http://www.gemeentesudwestfryslan.nl/ |archive-date=7 September 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> One of the leaders was [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]], whose farm had been burned down and whose kinfolk had been killed by a marauding [[Black Band (landsknechts)|''Landsknecht'' regiment]]. Since the regiment had been employed by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] authorities to suppress the civil war of the [[Vetkopers and Schieringers|Fetkeapers and Skieringers]], Donia put the blame on the authorities. After this he gathered angry peasants and some petty noblemen from Frisia and Gelderland and formed the ''Arumer Zwarte Hoop''.The rebels received financial support from [[Charles II, Duke of Guelders]], who claimed the Duchy of [[Guelders]] in opposition to the House of Habsburg. Charles also employed mercenaries under command of his military commander [[Maarten van Rossum]] in their support. However, when the tides turned against the rebels after the Donia's death in 1520, Charles withdrew his support, without which the rebels could no longer afford to pay their mercenary army.<ref name="Kalma-pg50">{{cite book |title=Grote Pier Van Kimswerd |last=Kalma |first=J.J. |editor=de Tille |year=1970 |location=Netherlands |isbn=90-70010-13-5 |pages=50}}</ref> The revolt was put to an end in 1523 and Frisia was incorporated into the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], bringing an end to the Frisian freedom.<ref name="Wûnseradiel"/>

===Modern times===
[[File:Gemme van Burmania voor Philips II.jpg|thumb|The Frisian representative refusing to kneel before [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] at his coronation]]

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, became the first lord of the [[Lordship of Frisia]]. He appointed [[Georg Schenck van Toutenburg]], who had crushed the peasants' revolt, as [[Stadtholder]] to rule over the province in his stead. When Charles abdicated in 1556, Frisia was inherited by [[Philip II of Spain]] along with the rest of the Netherlands. In 1566, Frisia joined the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Spanish rule.

In 1577, [[George de Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg]] was appointed Stadtholder of Frisia and other provinces. A moderate, trusted by both sides, he tried to reconcile the rebels with the Crown. But in 1580, Rennenburg declared for Spain. The [[States of Friesland|States of Frisia]] raised troops and took his strongholds of Leeuwarden, Harlingen and Stavoren. Rennenburg was deposed and Frisia became the fifth Lordship to join the rebels' [[Union of Utrecht]]. From 1580 onward, all stadtholders were members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. With the [[Peace of Münster]] in 1648, Frisia became a full member of the independent [[Dutch Republic]], a federation of provincies. In economic and therefore also political importance, Friesland was next in rank to the provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].

In 1798, three years after the [[Batavian Revolution]], the provincial lordship of Frisia was abolished and its territory was divided between the Eems and Oude IJssel departments. This was short-lived, however, as Frisia was revived as a department in 1802. When the Netherlands were annexed by the [[First French Empire]] in 1810, the department was in French renamed [[Frise (department)|Frise]]. After [[Napoleon]] was defeated in 1813 and a new constitution was introduced in 1814, Friesland became a province of the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands]], then of the unitary [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] a year later.

Friesland is situated at {{coord|53|8|N|5|49|E|region:NL-FR}} in the northwest of the [[Netherlands]], west of the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], northwest of [[Drenthe]] and [[Overijssel]], north of [[Flevoland]], northeast of the [[IJsselmeer]] and [[North Holland]], and south of the [[North Sea]]. It is the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|largest province]] of the Netherlands if one includes areas of water; in terms of land area only, it is the third-largest province.

Most of Friesland is on the mainland, but it also includes a number of [[West Frisian Islands]], including [[Vlieland]], [[Terschelling]], [[Ameland]] and [[Schiermonnikoog]], which are connected to the mainland by ferry. The province's highest point is a dune at {{convert|45|m}} above sea level, on the island of Vlieland.

There are four [[List of national parks of the Netherlands|national parks of the Netherlands]] located in Friesland: [[Schiermonnikoog National Park|Schiermonnikoog]], [[De Alde Feanen National Park|De Alde Feanen]], [[Lauwersmeer National Park|Lauwersmeer]] (partially in Groningen), and [[Drents-Friese Wold National Park|Drents-Friese Wold]] (also partially situated in Drenthe).

==Economy==
[[File:Friesian Stallion.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friesian horse]]]]

Friesland is mainly an agricultural province. The black and white [[Holstein (cattle)|Frisian cattle]], black and white [[Stabyhoun]] and the black [[Frisian horse]] originated here. [[Tourism]] is another important source of income: the principal tourist destinations include the lakes in the southwest of the province and the islands in the [[Wadden Sea]] to the north. There are [[List of windmills in Friesland|195 windmills]] in the province of Friesland, out of a total of about 1200 in the entire country.

The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 19.8 billion € in 2018, accounting for 2.6% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €26,700  or 89% of the EU27 average in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417095003/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-date=17 April 2020 |url-status=live |title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018 |website=Eurostat}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
[[File:WIKITONGUES- Sjoukje speaking West Frisian.webm|thumb|A West Frisian speaker, recorded in the [[Netherlands]].]]

Friesland is one of the twelve provinces of the Netherlands to have its national language that is recognized as such, [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]. Before the 18th century, varieties of Frisian were also spoken in the provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[Groningen]], and together with the Frisian speakers in [[Ost-Friesland|East Friesland]] and [[North Frisia|North Friesland]] a continuous linguistic area existed between Amsterdam and the present day Danish-German border.

The [[mutual intelligibility]] in reading between Dutch and Frisian is limited. A [[cloze test]] in 2005 revealed native Dutch speakers understood 31.9% of a West Frisian newspaper, 66.4% of an [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] newspaper and 97.1% of a Dutch newspaper.<ref>{{cite journal |title=How easy is it for speakers of Dutch to understand Frisian and Afrikaans, and why? |first1=Renée van |last1=Bezooijen |first2=Charlotte |last2=Gooskens |journal=Linguistics in the Netherlands |volume=22 |date=2005 |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_lingneth_2005.pdf |pages=18, 21, 22 |access-date=11 December 2022 |archive-date=16 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221016135157/http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_lingneth_2005.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007, [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is the native language of 54.3% of the inhabitants of the province of Friesland, followed by [[Dutch language|Dutch]] with 34.7%, and speakers of other regional languages, most of these restricted to Friesland, with 9.7%, and in the end other foreign languages with 1.4%. Frisian speakers are traditionally underrepresented in urban areas, and predominant in the countryside.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docplayer.nl/69343301-Rapportage-quick-scan-friese-taal-2007-provincie-fryslan.html |title=Rapportage quick scan Friese taal 2007 Provincie Fryslân - PDF |website=docplayer.nl |access-date=10 June 2018 |archive-date=21 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220221005817/https://docplayer.nl/69343301-Rapportage-quick-scan-friese-taal-2007-provincie-fryslan.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

West Frisian is also spoken in a small adjacent part of the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. Up to the 18th century Frisian was spoken in the, at that time Prussian and Hanoverian, lordships of [[Ost-Friesland|East Friesland]]). Since then the East Frisian population switched to [[East Frisian Low Saxon|East Frisian (''Ostfriesisch'')]], a [[Low German]] dialect. Only in some, formerly remoted, East Frisian villages ([[Saterland]]) a variety of historically [[Saterland Frisian language|East Frisian]] (''Seeltersk'') is still in use but by an older generation. A collection of dialects named [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]], is or was spoken in [[North Friesland]], alongside the North Sea coast and on the islands of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. The named Frisian languages are historically related to [[Old English]], which points towards the fact that [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]] and [[Saxons]], eventually accompanied by Frisians, came from these areas.

In [[Stellingwarfs|Stellingwerf]], in south-east Friesland, a dialect of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] is spoken,<ref>{{Glottolog|stel1238|Stellingwerfs}}</ref> as is in the northeast in [[Kollumerpomp]].

In the former municipality of [[het Bildt]] the Hollandic dialect of [[Bildts]] is spoken. It contains a lot of Frisian influence. In most of the cities of Leeuwarden, [[Town Frisian]] is spoken. As with Bildts, these variants are Hollandic dialects with Frisian influence.

The language policy in Friesland is preservation. West Frisian is a mandatory subject in Friesland in primary and secondary schools of the Frisian speaking districts. Bilingual (Dutch–Frisian) and trilingual (Dutch–English–Frisian) schools in the province of Friesland use West Frisian as a language of instruction in some lessons, besides Dutch in most other lessons and alongside them English. Literacy in Frisian however, is not often a core aim and that makes the number of Frisians speakers able to write in Frisian only 12%.<ref>(Hilton, 2013)</ref>

The provincial government takes various initiatives to preserve the West Frisian language. All parents in Friesland receive, at their children's birth, information about language and multilingualism (e.g. 'taaltaske'{{clarify|date=May 2021}}). To support the use of Frisian in public and at public events, the province also invests in the development of speech pathology materials and strives to create information technology devices for the West Frisian language. The Frisian government subsidizes the ''Afûk'' organization, which offers language courses and actively promotes Frisian in all sectors of society as well as the corporate domain which as a rule is dominated by Dutch and English.<ref>(Afûk 2011)</ref> The province also promotes a wide range of art and entertainment in Frisian.<ref>Hilton, N. H., & Gooskens, C. (2013). Language policies and attitudes towards Frisian in the Netherlands. Phonetics in Europe: Perceptions and production, 139-157.</ref>

=== Sports ===
[[File:Finish 11-stedentocht 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Finish of the [[Elfstedentocht]] in 1956]]

The province is famous for its [[Speed skating|speed skaters]], with mass participation in cross-country ice skating when weather conditions permit. When winters are cold enough to allow the freshwater canals to freeze hard, the province holds its traditional [[Elfstedentocht]] (Eleven cities tour), a {{convert|200|km|adj=on}} [[ice skating]] tour. A traditional sport is [[Frisian handball]]. Another Frisian practice is ''[[fierljeppen]]'', a sport with some similarities to pole vaulting. A jump consists of an intense sprint to the pole (''polsstok''), jumping and grabbing it, then climbing to the top while trying to control the pole's forward and lateral movements over a body of water and finishing with a graceful landing on a sand bed opposite to the starting point. Because of all the diverse skills required in fierljeppen, fierljeppers are considered to be very complete athletes with superbly developed strength and coordination. In the warmer months, many Frisians practice ''[[wadlopen]]'', the traditional art of wading across designated sections of the [[Wadden Sea]] at low tide.
Friesland has lots of waterways and lake s there for Sailcontests with a Skutsje or frisian Tjalk is done during the summer on various lakes.

There are currently two professional [[association football|football]] clubs playing in Friesland: [[SC Cambuur]] from Leeuwarden (home stadium [[Cambuur Stadion]]) active in de keuken kampioen divisie(2nd div.) and [[SC Heerenveen]] (home stadium [[Abe Lenstra Stadion]]) active in de Eredivisie(1st div.).
