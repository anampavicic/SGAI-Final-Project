'''Tumbes''' is a city in northwestern [[Peru]], on the banks of the [[Tumbes River]]. It is the capital of the [[Tumbes Region]], as well as of [[Tumbes Province]] and [[Tumbes District]]. Located near the [[Ecuador–Peru border|border]] with [[Ecuador]], Tumbes has 111,595 inhabitants as of 2015. It is served by the [[Cap. FAP Pedro Canga Rodriguez Airport]]. It is located on the Gulf of Guayaquil along with Zorritos.

==History==
[[Image:Catedral de Tumbes.jpg|thumb|left|Tumbes Cathedral]]
Tumbes has its origins back in [[Cultural periods of Peru|pre-Inca]] times when it was inhabited by a cultural group of natives called '''Tumpis'''. At its peak, its population is estimated to have reached 178,000. After 1400, Inca [[Pachacuti]] ruled over Tumbes and the territory became an important political stronghold during the [[Inca Empire]]. Later Inca emperor [[Huayna Capac]] expanded Tumbes by ordering the construction of roads, houses and palaces.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|123}}

===Spanish arrival===
Tumbes was first visited by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Pizarro]] during the start of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in 1528.<ref name=Prescott>Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, {{ISBN|9781420941142}}</ref>{{rp|119–123}} Molina noted that Tumbes was a well organized town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021|reason=Who is Molina}} Pizarro made a second expedition in 1532 during which he encountered resistance from the [[curaca]] (chieftain) ''Chilimaza'' in what became known as the ''Battle of the Manglares''. Pizarro was eventually successful and is said to have planted a cross in the invaded territory as a sign of Hispanic victory. [[Felipillo]] and [[Yacané]], the first South American Indigenous interpreters who later aided Pizarro and his followers during the conquest of Peru, were born in Tumbes.{{cn|date=February 2023}}

===Colony and independence===
[[File:Tumbes Puerto Pizarro.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Port Pizarro]]
During its colonial period, Tumbes was sparsely populated and formed a part of the Audiencia of Quito through an unmodified Cedula of 1563 and Cedula of 1740. When Tumbes declared its independence from Spain, it opted to join Peru believing in the right of free determination of peoples. First, the Republic of the Gran Colombia challenged that right and then Ecuador claiming de jure rights through unmodified colonial Royal Decrees ( Real Cédulas ), but to no avail. The Protocol of Rio de Janeiro signed in 1942 with Ecuador legally confirmed Peru's previously de facto rights over Tumbes after a victorious war. However, lasting peace between both countries was not achieved until 1998, after a final conflict in 1995. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Ecuadorian Presidente Jamil Mahuad signed a final document in which Ecuador accepted Perú's right over Tumbes and other territories claimed by Ecuador until then.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

==Geography==

===Climate===
Tumbes has a [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot arid climate]] (Köppen ''BWh''), although it receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|307.5|mm|in|1|disp=or}}, due to its high [[potential evapotranspiration]]. Rainfall is very variable due to the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]], with strong El Niños frequently seeing more than twice the mean rain.
