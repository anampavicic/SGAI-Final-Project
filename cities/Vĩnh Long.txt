==Location==
Vĩnh Long is on the [[Cổ Chiên River]], which branches out from the [[Mekong]] River at the narrows of [[Mỹ Thuận, Vĩnh Long|Mỹ Thuận]] about {{convert|10|km}} upstream, only to meet it later downstream. Across the Cổ Chiên river from Vĩnh Long are the An Binh and Bình Hòa Phước islands, some {{convert|15|km}} across, with the Mekong River on the other side. A number of canals run through Vĩnh Long, with tall vehicular bridges crossing them. Transport by boat is possible, although parts of the town, particularly An Binh, become unreachable at low tide.

Vĩnh Long is about two hours from the large city of [[Cần Thơ]] in the adjacent [[Hậu Giang Province]], and about three hours from [[Saigon]]. The floating market town of [[Cái Bè]] is on the other side of the An Binh island and is the frequent destination for tourists from Vĩnh Long.
