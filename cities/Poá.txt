== General appearance ==
Poá is one of the eleven municipalities in São Paulo considered to be spas by the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], as they meet certain prerequisites defined by state law. This [[status]] guarantees these municipalities a larger budget from the state for the development of regional tourism. In addition, the municipality acquires the right to add to its name the title of [[spa]], a term by which it is designated both in official municipal records and in state references. The main sector of Poá's economy is services, since the installation of polluting industries was made difficult after 1970, the year in which it became a spa. In terms of territory, it is one of the smallest municipalities in the state of São Paulo (larger only than [[Águas de São Pedro]] and [[São Caetano do Sul]]). The [[verticalization]] of the city center is discouraged, with the aim of preserving the city's rural atmosphere, with narrow streets and the preservation of several old buildings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Poá - Guia do cidade Poá -SP Aqui você Encontra ! |url=https://www.encontrapoa.com.br/ |access-date=2024-10-14 |website=www.encontrapoa.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref>

Poá is one of eleven municipalities considered spa towns (Estancia Hidromineral) by the state of São Paulo, fulfilling certain prerequisites set by state law. This status ensures that these municipalities more money from the state to promote regional tourism and beyond that the city acquired the right to add the title "Estancia Hidromineral" to its name, a term which is designated by both the municipal expedient as the official state references. Poá's economy is mainly [[Tertiary sector|service-focused]], since the installation of polluting industries has been banned since 1970, the year it became a spa town. Territory-wise, is one of the smallest municipalities in the state of São Paulo (only bigger than Aguas de São Pedro and São Caetano do Sul).

[[Verticalization]] in the city center is discouraged to preserve the small-town atmosphere of the city, with narrow streets and the preservation of several old buildings. The council is not the richest in the region, but still outperforms its neighbors in several social indicators, thus signaling that the economic growth of Poá is more equal and sustainable than in other cities, and that its population has a better quality of life due to public facilities (schools, parks and health units). In indexes like the human development index, the child development index and the index of development of basic education, Poá surpasses all municipalities. In 2007 it was considered one of the safest cities of São Paulo, specifically the 5th, behind only São Caetano do Sul, Barueri, Caieiras and Mogi das Cruzes.

An example of a tourist attraction, is the municipal spa Vicente Leporace, located in front of the 
Fonte Aúrea, which was opened in 1970 as a condition for the council to receive the title of hidromineral and tourist resort. After being used for 30 years, it was deactivated at the beginning of the decade, because the mayor at the time, Eduardo Carlos Felippe, felt that there was no need to have a spa in the city.  Since then the site is used as a physiotherapy center.{{cn|date=March 2023}}
