As an indication of its economic importance, one of Mexico's ''[[banderas monumentales]]'' is in the city (these ''banderas'' have been established in state capitals and cities of significance).

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic period===
Before the founding of Nuevo Laredo, the area was inhabited by different nomadic indigenous tribes. The most prominent indigenous group to have lived in the Nuevo Laredo region were the [[Coahuiltecan|Coahuiltecas]]. The Coahuiltecas were hunter-gatherers who manufactured many stone and leather artifacts in order to survive the harsh environment.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mendez |first=Daniel |date=August 17, 2021 |title=Nuevo Laredo: los indios Coahuiltecos que habitaron nuestra tierra |language=Spanish |trans-title=Nuevo Laredo: The Coahuilteca Indians Who Inhabited Our Land |work=El Mañana de Nuevo Laredo |url=https://elmanana.com.mx/nuevo-laredo/2021/8/17/nuevo-laredo-los-indios-coahuiltecos-que-habitaron-nuestra-tierra-57789.html |access-date=November 29, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Lopez |first=Jose Antonio |date=February 4, 2018 |title=López: Remembering our Coahuilteca Connections |work=Rio Grande Guardian International News Service |url=https://riograndeguardian.com/lopez-remembering-our-coahuilteca-connections/ |access-date=November 29, 2023}}</ref>

Later, the region saw the influx of other nomadic indigenous tribes, such as the [[Apache]]s and [[Comanche]]s. The increasing numbers of Apaches led the Spanish authorities to establish military garrisons and towns to serve as a buffer zone against northern indigenous tribes. Laredo (now in Texas) was one of those towns founded by the Spanish, from which Nuevo Laredo would stem into existence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Olvera Charles |first=Fernando |date=December 2010 |title=La resistencia nativa en el centro-sur de Nuevo Santander, 1780-1796 : política de frontera de guerra y estrategias de rechazo indígena a la colonización |trans-title=Native resistance in south-central Nuevo Santander, 1780-1796: border war policy and strategies of indigenous rejection of colonization. |url=http://colsan.repositorioinstitucional.mx/jspui/handle/1013/289 |journal=El Colegio de San Luis, San Luis Potosí |language=Spanish |via=Colsan Repository}}</ref>

===Colonial period===
Nuevo Laredo was part of the territory of the original settlement of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] (now in Texas) which was founded in 1755 by the Spaniard [[Don Tomás Sánchez]] in the northern part of the [[Rio Grande]]. The settlement's territory was granted to José de Escandón by the King of Spain, and the settlement's territory and population remained unified for ninety years, until the war of 1846–1848, the [[Mexican–American War]].

===Independent period===

Early in 1848, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] divided the territory attached to Laredo between the United States ([[Texas]]) and Mexico ([[Tamaulipas]]). Nuevo Laredo was founded on June 15, 1848, by seventeen Laredo families who wished to remain Mexican and therefore moved to the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. They identified with Mexico, its history, and its cultural customs, and decided to keep their Mexican citizenship. The founders of Nuevo Laredo even took with them the bones of their ancestors so they would continue to rest in Mexican ground.

In August 25, 1855 the customs house was officially established in Nuevo Laredo by orders of [[Santiago Vidaurri]], governor of [[Nuevo León|Nuevo Leon]] and [[Coahuila]], and military chief of Tamaulipas. This was to collect [[Tariff|import taxes]] at the new border with the United States.<ref name="Ceballos">{{Cite web |last=Ceballos |first=Manuel |date=January 27, 2023 |title=Breve Historia de la Aduana en Nuevo Laredo |url=https://medium.com/@mceballosmartinez_69220/breve-historia-de-la-aduana-en-nuevo-laredo-718de6651fda |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=Medium}}</ref>

In 1858 a duty-free zone was established along the border with the United States. Nuevo Laredo fell inside this area of tax exemption in order to be competitive with American markets. The creation of this border economic zone was ratified three years later by president [[Benito Juárez|Benito Juarez]].<ref name="Ceballos"/>

During the early stage of international trade that crossed through the [[Laredo–Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo-Laredo]] border, activity in general was low but high in import-export of cattle, gold, silver and leather.<ref name="Ceballos"/>

In 1881, the railroad infrastructure connecting Nuevo Laredo with central Mexico and with San Antonio, Texas was established by president [[Porfirio Díaz|Porfirio Diaz]]. This created the need to build a more formal [[Custom house|Customs House]] building equipped to this new reality in 1887. The new economic boom made Nuevo Laredo become the 3rd most important international commercial crossing in Mexico, so in 1891 the Congress of the state of Tamaulipas formally elevated the status of Nuevo Laredo to a city.<ref name="Ceballos"/>

===Modern period===

20th-century Nuevo Laredo was politically and socially dominated locally by the presence of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI political party]] and workers' unions. While economically, the city continued to be influenced by international trade with the United States and its influential customs office. 

The Nuevo Laredo customs office became so important, that the city began to attract an influx of population from different regions of the country. [[Customs officer|Custom officials]] were brought from [[Mexico City]] to fill the ever-growing departments within the Custom offices in the international bridges, railroad, airport, checkpoints, [[Servicio de Administración Tributaria|tax-collecting offices]], and administration office.

The population growth attracted more people, which led to chaotically expand its urban sprawl. The eastern side is enclosed by the Rio Grande River, so people had no choice but to settle in its western side, locally known as ''el poniente'' (the west). Hence, the west-side of Nuevo Laredo became poverty-stricken, unprivileged and crime infested. 

In the 1980s and 1990s municipal presidents of Nuevo Laredo focused their efforts in regularizing the west-side settlements into incorporated neighborhoods. In the 2000s and 2010s endeavors by municipal presidents shifted to paving streets and building schools for west-side Nuevo Laredo. But no intention was ever accomplished to eliminate crime. 

In 2013, the decade-long PRI party hegemony in Nuevo Laredo was broken when Carlos Enrique Canturosas Villarreal of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN political party]] was elected municipal president. 

A shortage of [[natural gas]] led to blackouts in Texas and along the border during the [[February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm]]. Millions on both sides of the border were left without gas or electricity, heat or running water. Factories and restaurants were forced to close, and people lost their jobs. Mayor Enrique Rivas Cuéllar called upon the population not to panic.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Figueroa |first1=Carlos |first2= |title=Pide alcalde de Nuevo Laredo no caer en pánico ante escasez de gas |url=https://www.jornada.com.mx/notas/2021/02/21/estados/pide-alcalde-de-nuevo-laredo-no-caer-en-panico-ante-escases-de-gas/ |access-date=February 21, 2021 |work=jornada.com.mx |publisher=La Jornada |language=es}}</ref>

As of February 19, 2021, Nuevo Laredo reported 4,714 cases of [[COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico|COVID-19]].<ref>{{cite web |title=index NLD status COVID-19 |url=https://www.indexnld.org.mx/coronavirus/ |website=indexnld.org.mx |publisher=Index Nuevo Laredo |access-date=February 21, 2021}}</ref>

===Drug-related violence===
{{See also|Mexican drug war}}As a [[border town]], Nuevo Laredo is known for its [[wikt:turf war|turf war]] in which [[drug cartel]]s compete for control of the drug trade into the United States. Nuevo Laredo is a lucrative drug corridor. A large number of trucks pass through the area. There are multiple exploitable ports of entry.<ref name="longmirecartel">{{cite news |last=Longmire |first=Sylvia |date=5 May 2012 |title=Nuevo Laredo heats up as Sinaloa-Zetas conflict leaves 23 dead. |newspaper=Mexico's drug war |url=http://borderviolenceanalysis.typepad.com/mexicos_drug_war/2012/05/nuevo-laredo-heats-up-as-sinaloa-zetas-conflict-leaves-23-dead.html |access-date=12 May 2012}}</ref>

====Los Texas====

During the 1980s and 1990s the criminal syndicate known as Los Texas was based in Nuevo Laredo and operated all over the Mexican states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas as well as the US state of Texas. Their leader was Arturo Martinez Herrera “El Texas”.

Their criminal activity began as coyotes, sending illegal immigrants into the United States. Then they used illegal immigrants to cross the border with drugs. Their grip on Nuevo Laredo against other criminal groups generated deadly violence.

“El Texas” was arrested, and Guillermo Martinez Herrera “El Borrado” took control of Los Texas. When “El Borrado” was captured, Daniel Martinez Herrera “El Negro” became the leader, although true power remained with “El Borrado” who operated from his luxurious prison cell at Nuevo Laredo’s La Loma prison.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 10, 2017 |title=La Historia de Los Texas de Polleros a Jefes de Plaza de Nuevo Laredo |trans-title=The History of Los Texas, from coyotes to kingpins of Nuevo Laredo |url=https://www.valorportamaulipas.com.mx/2017/12/la-historia-de-los-texas-de-polleros.html?m=1 |access-date=December 2, 2023 |website=Valor por Tamaulipas |language=Spanish}}</ref>

====Los Zetas====

[[Los Zetas]], the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, and based in Nuevo Laredo, escalated violence to unprecedented violence in the summer of 2003<ref>{{Cite news |last=Balli |first=Cecilia |date=August 2005 |title=Borderline Insanity |work=Texas Monthly |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/borderline-insanity/ |access-date=December 1, 2023}}</ref> through gruesome violence and military-like tactics against the Sinaloa Cartel. Los Zetas also instilled terror against journalists and civilians of Nuevo Laredo. This set a new precedent which cartels later mimicked.<ref name="El Universal newspaper">{{Cite news |others=Written by Editorial Desk |date=February 10, 2018 |title=Z-43: Los Zetas después de "Los Zetas" |language=Spanish |trans-title=Z-43: The Zetas After “The Zetas” |work=El Universal newspaper |url=https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/seguridad/z-43-los-zetas-despues-de-los-zetas/ |access-date=December 1, 2023}}</ref>

Los Zetas and Gulf Cartel separated in early 2010 and fought for the control of the smuggling routes to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dissecting a Mexican Cartel Bombing in Monterrey |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20111026-dissecting-mexican-cartel-bombing-monterrey |access-date=8 December 2011 |publisher=Stratfor}}</ref> As of 2012, Los Zetas were thought to be Mexico's largest criminal organization.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 January 2012 |title=Zetas are Mexico's 'largest drug gang', study says |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16712239 |access-date=14 May 2012}}</ref> 2012 saw an [[2012 Nuevo Laredo massacres|unprecedented series of mass murder attacks]] in the city between the Sinaloa Cartel and Gulf Cartel on one side and Los Zetas on the other.

Los Zetas had a rapid expansion of their criminal activities. Based in Nuevo Laredo, they expanded to 17 Mexican states. They caused many notable massacres across many of these states. Stretching of resources as well as the capture and killing of their main leaders contributed to the decline of Los Zetas.<ref name="El Universal newspaper"/> The criminal organization ceased to exist under this name and structure, in its place Cartel Del Noreste (Northeastern Cartel) or CDN was born.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 16, 2022 |others=Press Release |title=Leader of Cartel Del Noreste Arrested |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/leader-cartel-del-noreste-arrested |access-date=December 1, 2023 |website=U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Texas |publisher=United States Department of Justice}}</ref>

====Cartel del Noreste====

The Cartel del Noreste, known locally by its initials CDN, grew power from its deep historical roots in Nuevo Laredo. The CDN managed to pushed away their rival cartels, Zetas Vieja Escuela and Gulf Cartel, grasping control of Nuevo Laredo. CDN also held control of Nuevo Laredo because its top leaders are locals and members of the Treviño family. First, Juan Francisco Treviño Chávez, alias “El Kiko” assumed leadership of the CDN cartel. After his capture in 2016, Juan Gerardo Treviño Chávez, alias “El Huevo” assumed control of CDN.<ref name="Asmann">{{Cite news |last=Asmann |first=Parker |date=March 16, 2023 |title=The Northeast Cartel and Criminal Hegemony in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico |work=Insight Crime |url=https://insightcrime.org/news/northeast-cartel-criminal-hegemony-nuevo-laredo-mexico/ |access-date=December 2, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |others=Editorial Desk |date=December 2, 2019 |title=El origen del temible cártel del Noreste |language=Spanish |trans-title=The origin of the fearsome Northeastern Cartel |work=La Silla Rota |url=https://lasillarota.com/nacion/2019/12/2/el-origen-del-temible-cartel-del-noreste-198004.html |access-date=December 2, 2023}}</ref>

In March 2022, the Mexican military arrested “El Huevo”, sparking an extreme outbreak of violence marked by an hours-long firefight, burned-out vehicles, and shots fired at the United States Consulate in Nuevo Laredo.<ref name="Asmann"/>

In November 29, 2023, the leader of the CDN Cesar Silva Delgado “El Tartas” was captured by the Mexican military and the Mexican National Guard in Nuevo Laredo. During his arrest, authorities seized a gold-plated AK-47, a handgun, ammo and magazines for high-caliber firearms. Authorities also seized 2,500 fentanyl pills.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rodriguez |first=Cesar G. |date=November 29, 2023 |title=Cartel Del Noreste plaza boss arrested in Nuevo Laredo |work=Laredo Morning Times |url=https://www.lmtonline.com/local/article/cartel-del-noreste-leader-arrested-nuevo-laredo-18522499.php |access-date=December 2, 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==
Nuevo Laredo is in the northern tip of [[Tamaulipas]] on the west end of the [[Rio Grande Plains]]. The [[Rio Grande]] is the only source that supplies its citizens with water. [[El Coyote Creek]] supplies Nuevo Laredo's only natural lake [[El Laguito]] (The Small Lake). The area consists of a few hills and flat land covered with [[grass]], [[oak]], and [[mesquite]].

=== Climate ===
Nuevo Laredo features a [[semi-arid climate]]. Nuevo Laredo's weather is influenced by its proximity to the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] to the west, by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountains to the south and west, and by the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Much of the moisture from the Pacific is blocked by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. Therefore, most of the moisture derives from the Gulf of Mexico. Its geographic location causes Nuevo Laredo's weather to range from long periods of heat to sudden violent storms in a short period of time. Nuevo Laredo is cold for Tamaulipas standards during winter, the average daytime highs are around {{convert|66|°F|order=flip}} and overnight lows around {{convert|43|°F|order=flip}}; although it is rare for snow to fall in Nuevo Laredo, there was actually snow on the ground for a few hours on the morning of [[Christmas Day]] 2004.

Nuevo Laredo experiences an average high temperature of about {{convert|99|°F|order=flip}}, and an average low of about {{convert|75|°F|order=flip}} during summer, and {{convert|20|in|mm|order=flip}} of rain per year. As Laredo sometimes undergoes [[drought]], a [[water conservation]] [[Law|ordinance]] was implemented in 2003.

==Economy==
[[File:Monumento La Madre Royal Crowne Plaza.jpg|thumb|upright|The Monument to Mothers in front of the Best Western Plus Nuevo Laredo hotel]]
Nuevo Laredo (along with Laredo, Texas) is the most important trade border crossing of Latin America (approximately 8500 trucks cross the [[Mexico–United States border|border]] each day).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamnafta.com/index.php/Market-Profiles/nuveo_laredo.html |title=teamnafta.com;Nuevo Laredo Industrial Profile |access-date=2008-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705094157/http://www.teamnafta.com/index.php/Market-Profiles/nuveo_laredo.html |archive-date=2008-07-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ldfonline.org/products.asp?cat=64&hierarchy=0 |title=Transportation |publisher=Ldfonline.org |access-date=2012-10-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220153022/http://www.ldfonline.org/products.asp?cat=64&hierarchy=0 |archive-date=2012-02-20 }}</ref> Its geographical position has enabled this city to grow and specialize in the [[international trade]] business. Nuevo Laredo has a very developed [[logistics]] and [[transportation]] industry, complemented with a variety of hotel chains, restaurants and a cultural center where events such as the Tamaulipas International Festival take place.

Nuevo Laredo is on the primary trade route connecting Canada, the United States and Mexico. Both Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, Texas are now the gateway to Mexico's burgeoning industrial complex, offering diverse markets, business opportunities and profit potential, which both business and industry cannot find anywhere else. Nuevo Laredo is the only Mexico/U.S. border city strategically positioned at the convergence of all land transportation systems. The main [[Mexican Federal Highway 85|highway]] and [[railroad]] leading from Central Mexico through [[Mexico City]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Saltillo]] and [[Monterrey]] join with two major U.S. rail lines at Nuevo Laredo and major American highway [[Interstate 35]], thus offering fast access to the most important metropolitan areas and seaports of Texas, as well as northern states and Canada. For more than a decade, Mexico's economic policies have greatly increased Mexico/U.S. trade and cross-border production in the Nuevo Laredo area.

There are three bridges in the Nuevo Laredo area: [[Gateway to the Americas International Bridge|International Bridge #1]] (the oldest), [[Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge|International Bridge #2]] (also known as Juarez-Lincoln; no pedestrians), and [[World Trade International Bridge|International Bridge #3]] (also known as the Free Trade or Libre Comercio Bridge, inaugurated in 1999, cargo only). There is also the [[Colombia-Solidarity International Bridge|Colombia-Solidarity (Solidaridad) Bridge]] (located about {{convert|20|mi|km}} northwest of the city in Colombia, Nuevo León). There are no urban areas on either side of this bridge.

Nuevo Laredo is a strategic investment point. On this site there are six recognized industrial parks: [[Oradel Industrial Center]], Longoria Industrial Park, Rio Bravo Industrial Park, Modulo Industrial America, FINSA Industrial Park, and Industrial Park Pyme.
