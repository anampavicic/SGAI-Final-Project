'''Kon Tum City''' is the capital city of [[Kon Tum province|Kon Tum Province]] in [[Vietnam]]. It is located inland in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] region of Vietnam, near the borders of [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]].

Historically, this area has been inhabited by the indigenous [[Bahnar people|Ba Na people]], which led to the name Kon Tum, meaning "Village by the Lake" in the Ba Na language. Its unique location features flat and fertile land, enriched by the [[Đăk Bla River|Dak Bla River]], and a convergence of various ethnic groups over time. Among these, the [[Kinh people]], hailing from provinces such as [[Quang Nam]], [[Quảng Ngãi province|Quang Ngai]], and [[Bình Định province|Binh Dinh]], have settled here. In the years 1841-1850, [[French people|French]] missionaries, en route to the Central Highlands, established the first [[Christians|Christian]] mission in this region. By 1893, the colonial French authorities established the Kon Tum administrative agency, headed by Father Vialleton, and from that point, the name Kon Tum became officially used. Subsequently, the provincial administrative unit adopted this name. Kon Tum City, once a sparsely populated and desolate area, has evolved into a hub for settlement, commerce, and governance throughout the province's rich history. Currently, Kon Tum City holds the status of [[Provincial city (Vietnam)|City (Class-2)]].

After the [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army of Vietnam]] invaded [[South Vietnam]] on March 30, 1972 during the [[Easter Offensive]], two divisions [[Battle of Kontum|attempted to capture]] Kon Tum, but failed. In March 1975, however, Kon Tum was overrun during the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]] and large numbers of refugees were forced to flee east to the south central coast.

Kon Tum has several vestiges of the French colonial period, as well as several tribal villages directly in the suburbs of the Vietnamese-reconstructed town. Among the town's landmarks, there is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[wood]]en [[church (building)|church]] on discrete stilts and a large French-built seminary which hosts a small museum on [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|local hill tribes]]. French [[missionary]] presence in Kon Tum traces back to 1851.

Kon Tum has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') with a wet season from April to November, a dry season from November to April, and consistently very warm-to-hot temperatures with high-to-oppressive humidity year-round.
