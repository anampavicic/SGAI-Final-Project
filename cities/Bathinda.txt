==History==
[[File:Qila Mubarak in Bathinda.jpg|thumb|left|a iconical Qila Mubarak which was built by King [[Kanishka]] in 2nd century CE and is the location where the first [[Empress]] of India [[Razia Sultana]] was held captive<ref name="fort">{{cite web |title=Raziya Sultan |url=http://www.indiasite.com/delhi/history/raziasultan.html |access-date=7 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331130034/http://www.indiasite.com/delhi/history/raziasultan.html |archive-date=31 March 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>]]Bhatinda was changed to Bathinda to conform to the phonetical expression as locally pronounced.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://bathinda.nic.in/html/district_at_a_glance.html#N10024|title=District at A glance|access-date=3 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110050936/http://bathinda.nic.in/html/district_at_a_glance.html#N10024#N10024|archive-date=10 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to [[Henry George Raverty]], Bathinda was known as ''Tabar-i-Hind'' (Labb-ut-Twarikh) or ''Tabarhindh'', which roughly translates as ‘Gateway to India’. The earliest mention of Tabar-i-Hind occurs in the ''Jami-Ul-Hakayat'' written about 607 Hijri or 1211 AD.<ref name="GoP">{{Cite web|author=|url=https://bathinda.nic.in/history/|title=Bhatinda History|publisher=Government of Punjab}}</ref>

In 1004, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] besieged and captured the local fort, which was located on the route from the northwest into the rich [[Ganges]] valley. In 1190, [[Muhammad of Ghor ]] attacked and occupied the fort of Bathinda. [[Prithviraj Chauhan]], the ruler of this region, managed to recover possession of the fort thirteen months later in 1191 after the [[First Battle of Tarain]]. However, Prithviraj Chauhan was killed in the [[Second Battle of Tarain]] and the fort of Bathinda once again came under the control of [[Muhammad Ghori]].

In the 3rd century, [[Rao Bhatti]] is credited with establishing the modern town of Bathinda in the [[Lakhi jungle]] area.<ref>Sir Roper Lethbridge, The golden book of India: a genealogical and biographical dictionary, page 112</ref> In 14th century, present region of bathinda was ruled by [[Bhati]] and [[Bhanot]] rulers of that time. [[Bhanot|1488]], Bathinda was conquered by [[Rao Bika]], son of [[Jodha of Mandore]] (founder of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]]) and became part of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner]] princely state.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gupta|first=Jugal Kishore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0Z457ZOR44C&dq=Rao+Bika+bhatinda&pg=PA24|title=History of Sirsa Town|date=1991|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|language=en}}</ref> Bathinda was an important fort in the area from [[Delhi]] to [[Lahore]] during the time of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].

As per [[Ain-i-Akbari]], Bathinda was included in the ''[[Sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]]'' of [[Sirhind-Fategarh|Sirhind]] in the [[Subah]] of [[Delhi]]. In 1634, a battle named [[Battle of Lahira]] (at Lahira in Bathinda) was fought between [[Guru Hargobind]] and [[Mughals]]. The town had become an important trade and commercial centre under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule and the [[Mughal Emperors]] such as [[Akbar]] and [[Aurangzeb]] undertook many projects to enhance the fort of Bathinda.

In circa 1754, the town was conquered by Maharaja Ala Singh, the [[Maharaja of Patiala]] and since then it followed the history of erstwhile princely state of [[Patiala]]. With the dawn of independence and merger of Patiala and East Punjab States into a division called [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] (PEPSU), Bathinda became a full-fledged district with headquarters at Bathinda city.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Environmental issues===
There has been increasing incidence of various types of cancer in and around Bathinda. It is attributed to the presence of polluting industries and the indiscriminate use of modern pesticides and other toxic materials in farming. A 2007 epidemiological study found that the surface waters of Bathinda are contaminated with [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[selenium]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] primarily due to the discharge of untreated waste water from surrounding industries. Unscientific farming practices, that emerged after the introduction of [[Green Revolution]], are also alleged to be a reason for growing incidence of not just cancer but also, high rates of spontaneous abortions, reproductive ailments, genetic deformities, [[anaemia]], [[diarrhoea]], vomiting, [[Skeletal fluorosis|fluorosis]] and a host of skin ailments including rashes and boils. Many young couples are also reported to be migrating out to save their children from adverse effects. Hence the government has completely banned the use of ground water in the city for drinking purposes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article2427870.ece|title=Cancer Bathinda's dubious distinction|date=6 September 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|last1=Sharma|first1=Vrinda}}</ref>
