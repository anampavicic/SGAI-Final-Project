It was formerly known for its various industries, like sugar refining and cotton milling.

== Etymology ==
Originally it was a group of four villages named Kather, the name of Raja Ram Singh. The first [[Nawab]] proposed to rename the city ''Faizabad''. But many other places were known by the name Faizabad so its name was changed to Mustafabad alias Rampur.<ref name="ram history">{{cite web|url=http://rampur.nic.in/history.htm |title=Rampur history |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521083242/http://rampur.nic.in/history.htm |archive-date=21 May 2012 |website=Rampur.nic.in |access-date=8 July 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|Rampur State}}
As per medieval history, Rampur was the part of the [[Delhi]] region, and was divided between [[Badaun]] and [[Sambhal]] districts. Being situated on upperside of [[Rohilkhand]], it was known by the name Kather {{citation required|date=December 2022}} and was ruled by Katheria Rajputs. The Katheria [[Rajput]]s resisted external for about 400 years, fighting the [[Delhi Sultanate|sultans of Delhi]] and later with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. They went to repeated battles with [[Nasiruddin Mahmud (grandson of Iltutmish)|Nasiruddin Mahmud]] in 1253, [[Ghiyas ud din Balban]] in 1256, [[Jalal-ud-din Khalji]] in 1290, [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] in 1379 & [[Sikandar Lodi]] in 1494.

Later, in the beginning of the Mughal period, the capital of [[Rohilkhand]] was changed from [[Badaun]] to [[Bareilly]] and hence the importance of Rampur increased.<ref name="ram history" />[[File:Flag of the Rampur State.svg|thumb|left|Flag of princely Rampur.]]

The [[Rohilla War]] of 1774–5 began when the [[Rohilla|Rohilla Pathans]] - dominant in the area - reneged on a debt they owed the [[Nawab of Oudh]] for military assistance against the [[Marathas]] in 1772. The [[Rohilla dynasty|Rohilla]] were defeated and driven from their former capital of [[Bareilly]] by the Nawab with the assistance of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]'s troops lent by [[Warren Hastings]].<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rampur |volume=22 |page=877}}</ref>

The [[Rohilla]] State of [[Rampur State|Rampur]] was established by [[Nawab Faizullah Khan]] on 7 October 1774 in the presence of British Commander Colonel Champion, and remained a pliant state under British protection thereafter.<ref name="Rampur temperature" />

[[File:Faizullah Khan.jpg|thumb|Faizullah Khan|left]]

Khan laid the first stone of the new fort at Rampur and thus Rampur city was founded in 1775. Originally it was a group of four villages named Kather, the name of Raja Ram Singh. The first Nawab proposed to rename the city 'Faizabad'. But many other places were known by the name of Faizabad already existed, so the name was changed to Mustafabad alias Rampur. Nawwab Faizullah Khan ruled for 20 years. He was a great patron of scholarship, and began the collection of [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Urdu]] manuscripts which now make up the bulk of the [[Rampur Raza Library]]. After his death his son Muhammad Ali Khan took over, but he was killed by the Rohilla leaders after 24 days, and Ghulam Muhammad Khan, the brother of the deceased, was proclaimed Nawab. The East India Company took exception to this, and after a reign of just 3 months and 22 days Ghulam Muhammad Khan was defeated by its forces.  The Governor-General made Ahmad Ali Khan, son of the late Muhammad Ali Khan, the new Nawab. He ruled for 44 years. He did not have any sons, so Muhammad Sa'id Khan, son of Ghulam Muhammad Khan, took over as the new Nawab. He raised a regular Army, established Courts and carried out many works to improve the economic conditions of farmers. His son Muhammad Yusuf Ali Khan took over after his death. His son Kalb Ali Khan became the new Nawab in 1865.<ref name="ram history" />

[[File:Imambara, Fort of Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, c.1911.jpg|thumb|Imambara, Fort of Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, ca.1911.|left]]

[[File:Sir Kalb Ali Khan, Nawab of Rampur (1832-1887).jpg|left|upright|thumb|Sir [[Kalb Ali Khan of Rampur|Kalb Ali Khan]], [[Nawab of Rampur]] (1832–1887)]]
[[Nawab]] [[Kalb Ali Khan of Rampur|Kalb Ali Khan]] was literate in Arabic and Persian. Under his rule, the state did much work to uplift standards of education. He was also a Member of Council during the Viceroyalty of Lord [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]]. He built the Jama Masjid in Rampur at a cost of Rs. 300,000. He was also knighted in Agra by the [[Prince of Wales]]. He ruled for 22 years and 7 months. After his death his son Mushtaq Ali Khan took over. He appointed W. C. Wright as the Chief Engineer of the state and built many new buildings and canals. Nawab Hamid Ali became the new ruler in 1889 at the age of 14. Many new schools were opened during his reign, and many donations were provided to nearby colleges. He donated Rs. 50,000 to Lucknow Medical College. In 1905 he built the magnificent [[Durbar (court)|Darbar]] Hall within the Fort which now houses the great collection of Oriental manuscripts held by the [[Rampur Raza Library]]. His son Raza Ali Khan became the last ruling Nawab in 1930.

On 1 July 1949 the State of Rampur was merged into the Republic of India. Rampur today presents a slightly decayed appearance: the palaces of the Nawabs are crumbling, as are the gates and walls of the fort. However, the Library remains a flourishing institution of immense value to scholars from all over the world.<ref name="ram history" />[[File:The procession of Yusef Ali Khan.jpg|thumb|center|Nawab of Rampur Yusef Ali Khan and his family on elephants escorted by Rampur and British troops to the encampment of Lord Canning]]

The Nawabs of Rampur sided with the British during [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],<ref name=EB1911/> and this enabled them to continue to play a role in the social, political and cultural life of Northern India in general and the Muslims of the United Provinces in particular. They gave refuge to some of the literary figures from the Court of [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahadur Shah ''Zafar'']].

===Post-independence===
Descendants of the [[Nawabs]] include Murad Mian the first child of [[Murtaza Ali Khan]] of Rampur. [[Noor Bano (politician)|Begum Noor Bano]], the widow of the former Nawab's younger brother and ex-MP [[Zulfikar Ali Khan|Zulfiquar Ali Khan]] of Rampur. Begum [[Noor Bano (politician)|Noor Bano]] has become a politician and won the election from Rampur parliamentary constituency in 1999. She lost the elections in 2004,2009 from Rampur and 2014 from Moradabad consecutively. Murtaza Ali Khan and Zulfiquar Ali Khan (aka Mikki Mia), who continued to use the title of Nawab as a token even after independence and abolition of royalty but never ruled Rampur, are now dead. Murtaza Ali contested an election from Rampur opposite his mother Rafat Jamani Begum in 1972 and won. Although the two brothers were always political rivals they never faced each other in elections. Subsequently, the family was also involved in smuggling scandals involving some smuggling from [[Pakistan]], where one of the sons of Murtaza Ali is married. Raza Inter College, Hamid Inter College and Murtaza Inter College are three higher secondary schools named after three nawabs.<ref name="Rampur temperature" />

The present [[Nawab]] of Rampur, Muhammad Murad Ali Khan Bahadur is the present titular Nawab of Rampur. The eldest son of Murtuza Ali Khan Bahadur, he succeeded his father as titular Nawab upon the latter's death in 1982. He served as a member on the Raza Library Board in Rampur from 1993 to 2002.

== Culture and Urdu Poetry ==

Rampur is considered as third school of poetry after Delhi and Lucknow.  Many prominent and legendary Urdu poets of the time like [[Daagh Dehlvi]], [[Mirza Ghalib]] and [[Amir Meenai]] joined the patronage of Rampur court. Nawabs of Rampur were very fond of poetry and other fine arts. They provided remunerations to the poets who were associated with ' ''darbar''.' 

=== Architecture ===
[[File:B16721LM.jpg|thumb|right|Small House Fort, now known as Raza Library]]

The Rulers of Rampur have had distinct impact on the architecture of the region. The buildings and monuments signify the presence of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] type architecture. Some of the buildings are very old and have been built over repeatedly in course of time.

One of the most well designed monument is the Fort of Rampur ([[Hindi]]:रामपुर का किला). It also houses the [[Raza Library]] or Hamid Manzil, the former palace of the Rulers. It has a sizeable collection of Oriental manuscripts in Asia. The fort also houses the [[Imambara]].

The ''Jama Masjid'' is one of the finest piece of architecture to be found in Rampur. It resembles the jama masjid in [[Delhi]] to some extent.{{original research inline|date=March 2019}} It was built by [[Nawab]] [[Faizullah Khan]]. It has a unique mughal touch to it. There are several entry-exit gates to the [[masjid]]. It has three big domes and four tall minarets with gold pinnacles boasting of a royal touch. It has a main lofty entrance gate that has an inbuilt clock tower occupied by a big clock that was imported from Britain.<ref name="rampur clock">[https://www.flickr.com/photos/94592664@N00/6556872453/in/photostream/ Rampur jama masjid history flick image], Retrieved 8 July 2012</ref>

There are several entry-exit gates built by the [[Nawab]]. These gates are major entry-exit routes from the city. Examples are Shahbad Gate, Nawab Gate, Bilaspur Gate etc.

=== Music ===
Rampur is associated with indian classical music since 1820. 
The [[Rampur-Sahaswan gharana]] of [[Hindustani classical music]] also has its origins in Rampur court of Nawabs. Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan was a court musician & given a title of Ratan from Rampur Nawab. He was given all facilities by the Rampur Court, nawab gifted him a house in Jail Road Area of the City,as he was also the first Padmabhushan Awardee for classical music in India.   Ustad Mehboob Khan, was a [[khayal]] singer and Veena player of the Rampur court; his son Ustad [[Inayat Hussain Khan]] (1849–1919), who trained many disciples and lived in Fort area of the city,was the founder of  Rampur-Sahaswan gharana.
<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ustadrashidkhan.com/gharana_hist.htm|title=The Gharana History - Ustad Rashid Khan|website=www.ustadrashidkhan.com}}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
Rampuri cuisine, a part of the [[Mughal cuisine]] tradition, developed by the chefs of the Nawabs, is also known for its distinct flavours and dishes with recipes passed on from the royal kitchen, like ''Rampuri fish'', '' Chicken Changezi '', '' Pasande haleem '', ''Rampuri Korma'', ''Rampuri mutton kebabs'', '' doodhiya biryani'', '' Dogoshta biryani'' and '' adrak ka halwa'', '' Sohan halwa ''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/01/22203755/The-culinary-cartographer.html|title=The culinary cartographer|date=22 January 2010|work=Mint}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=270513|title=Sharp cuts from the Rampuri !|date=7 January 2007|work=Business Standard}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/77009/|title=Mutton Korma in Rampur|date=28 August 2005|work=Indian Express}}</ref>

=== Knife making ===
 
Rampur was traditionally famous for the knives known as ''[[Rampuri]] Chaaku'', which even made their way to [[Bollywood]] crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s. Eventually the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] banned making knives longer than 4.5&nbsp;inches in blade length, leading to a drop in their popularity.<ref name="Rampuri" /><ref name="topnews.in">{{Cite web|url=https://www.topnews.in/famed-rampuri-knives-may-soon-go-oblivion-296417|title=Famed Rampuri knives may soon go into oblivion &#124; TopNews|website=www.topnews.in}}</ref>

=== Rampur Greyhound ===
The [[Rampur Greyhound]] is a smooth-haired sighthound native to the region, often described as being more substantially built than other greyhounds. It was the favoured hound of the Nawabs for [[jackal coursing]], but was also used to hunt lions, tigers, leopards, and panthers. [[Ahmad Ali Khan of Rampur|Mh Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan Bahadur]] bred these dogs by combining [[Afgan Hound|Tazi]] and [[Greyhound|English Greyhound]] bloodlines.

=== Festivals ===
Religious practices are as much an integral part of everyday life and a very public affair as they are in the rest of India. Therefore, not surprisingly, many festivals are religious in origin although several of them are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. Among the most important Hindu festivals are [[Diwali]], [[Holi]] and [[Vijayadashami]], [[Mahashivaratri]], [[Ram Navmi]], [[Basant Panchami]], [[Sri Krishna Janamastmi]] and [[Raksha Bandhan]], which are also observed by Jains and Sikhs. [[Eid ul Milad]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Bakr-Id]], Muharram are Muslim religious festivals. [[Mahavir Jayanti]] is celebrated by [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddha Jayanti]] by Buddhists, [[Guru Nanak Jayanti]] by Sikhs and [[Good Friday]], [[Christmas]] by the Christians.

==Economy==

=== Industry and agriculture ===
Rampur has a largely agriculture-based economy. It has very fertile land, but little industry, and virtually no mineral extraction. The main industries of Rampur are [[Winemaking]], sugar processing, textile weaving, and the manufacture of agricultural implements. An inoperative sugar mill still stands in Rampur; it was closed down in 1999 amidst political rivalry, but work has since begun on restarting the mill after state government approval.<ref name="Rampur sugarmill">[http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/article2951285.ece Rampur sugar mill lies in ruins], Retrieved 7 August 2012</ref> The major cash crop of the city is [[mentha]], and menthol oil manufacturing also flourishes there.<ref name="Mentha rampur">[http://www.menthaallied.com/ Mentha work in rampur], Retrieved 8 July 2012</ref>

The company formerly known as Rampur Distillery & Chemical Company Ltd., [[Radico Khaitan]], was established in Rampur in 1943 and is India's second largest liquor manufacturer. The distillery at Rampur manufactures high grade Extra Neutral Spirits (ENA) from molasses and grain, with a production capacity of 75 million litres of molasses ENA, 30&nbsp;million of grain neutral spirits, and 460 thousands litres of malt whisky annually.<ref name="ram distil">[http://www.radicokhaitan.com/rampurdistillery.html Rampur distillery], Radicokhaitan.com Retrieved 8 July 2012</ref>

The [[kite]]-making industry is one of the oldest and prime industries in Rampur, with various sizes and shapes of kite created by hand to this day. The kites made in Rampur are in great demand all over [[Uttar Pradesh]].

[[Beedi]] making is another booming industry in Rampur. As noted above, Rampur-manufactured knives were quite famous in the 20th century and were known as ''[[Rampuri]] Chaaku''. Eventually, however, the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] banned making knives with blades longer than 4.5&nbsp;inches, leading to a drop in their popularity.<ref name="topnews.in"/>
