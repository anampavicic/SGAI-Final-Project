In 1699, the region between the Igaraçu river and the Serra da Ibiapaba, inhabited by indigenous people, was pioneered by Leonardo de Sá and his companions, who obtained a land grant on the banks of that river.
Under the name of Parnaíba, toponym that arose, according to some, from the desire of the first explorers of Piauí to pay homage to the then São Paulo district of Parnaíba, and, according to others, from the Tupi word that means 'great unnavigable river'.
From 1761 onwards its development began. At that time, there was a charqueada owned by Domingos Dias da Silva, Portuguese founder of Porto das Barcas and pioneer in the region, mainly in the commercial and agricultural sectors.
