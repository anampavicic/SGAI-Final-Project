{{Nihongo|'''Chiba Prefecture'''|千葉県|Chiba-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located in the [[Kantō region]] of [[Honshu]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Chiba-ken" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 109|page=109}}; "Kantō" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 479|page=479}}.</ref> Chiba Prefecture has a population of 6,278,060 (1 June 2019) and has a geographic area of {{cvt|5,157|km2}}. Chiba Prefecture borders [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] to the north, [[Saitama Prefecture]] to the northwest, and [[Tokyo]] to the west.

[[Chiba (city)|Chiba]] is the capital and largest city of Chiba Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Funabashi]], [[Matsudo]], [[Ichikawa, Chiba|Ichikawa]]<ref>Nussbaum, "Chiba" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 109|page=109}}</ref> and [[Kashiwa]]. Chiba Prefecture is located on Japan's eastern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast to the east of Tokyo, and is part of the [[Greater Tokyo Area]], the most populous [[metropolitan area]] in the world. Chiba Prefecture largely consists of the [[Bōsō Peninsula]], which encloses the eastern side of [[Tokyo Bay]] and separates it from [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. Chiba Prefecture is home to [[Narita International Airport]], the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]], and the [[Keiyō Industrial Zone]].

==Etymology==
The name of Chiba Prefecture in Japanese is formed from two [[kanji]] characters. The first, {{linktext|千}}, means "thousand" and the second, {{linktext|葉}} means "leaf". The name first appears as an ancient ''[[kuni no miyatsuko]]'', or regional command office, as the {{nihongo|''Chiba Kuni no Miyatsuko''|千葉国造}}.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.nihonjiten.com/data/263228.html|title=千葉国造（下総）|website=Nihonjiten.com}}</ref> The name was adopted by a branch of the [[Taira clan]], which moved to the area in present-day [[Chiba (city)|Chiba City]] in the late [[Heian period]]. The branch of the Taira adopted the name and became the [[Chiba clan]], and held strong influence over the area of the prefecture until the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. The name "Chiba" was chosen for the prefecture at the time its creation in [[1873]] by the {{Nihongo|[[Assembly of Prefectural Governors]]|地方官会議|Chihō Kankai Kaigi}}, an early [[Meiji era|Meiji-period]] body of prefectural governors that met to decide the structure of local and regional administration in Japan.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei (日本歴史地名大系) |title=千葉県の成立と行政的変遷 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-01 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref>

The compound word {{Nihongo|''Keiyō''|京葉}}, which refers to the Tokyo-Chiba region, is formed from the second character in [[Tokyo]] ({{linktext|京}}), and the second character in Chiba ({{linktext|葉}}), which can also be pronounced "kei" and "yō" respectively.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dijitaru daijisen |title=Keiyō |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-03-26 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> This compound is used in terms such as the [[Keiyō Line]], [[Keiyō Road]], [[Keiyō Rinkai Railway Rinkai Main Line]], and the [[Keiyō Industrial Zone]].

===Early history===
Chiba Prefecture was settled in prehistoric times, as evidenced by the [[Jōmon period]](縄文時代) remains in every part of the region. The prefecture holds the largest ''kaizuka'' [[midden|sea shell mounds]] in Japan, evidence of a large population in the prefecture that relied on the rich marine products of the Pacific Ocean and Tokyo Bay. [[Kofun]] burial mounds are found across the prefecture, with the largest group being in Futtsu along Tokyo Bay.<ref>{{cite book | script-title=ja:千葉県史料: 原始古代編 |trans-title=Historical Materials on Chiba Prefecture: Prehistory and Ancient History | volume = Kazusa-no-Kuni | year = 1963 | publisher = Chiba Prefecture | location = Chiba, Chiba Prefecture | language = ja | oclc = 37884389 | lccn = 67000809}}</ref>

===Asuka and Nara periods===
In the [[Asuka period]] (538–710), under the [[Taika Reform]] of 645, the administrative structure of present-day Chiba Prefecture changed significantly. The historical province of [[Fusa Province]], which may have covered much of Chiba and [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] prefectures, was divided into two provinces: [[Shimōsa Province]] (also called Shimofusa) in the north and [[Kazusa Province]] in the southern area. [[Awa Province (Chiba)|Awa Province]] at the south of Chiba Prefecture, was separated from Kazusa Prefecture in 718. These administrative units existed until they were abolished and merged into Chiba Prefecture after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The central government established a ''kokubunji'' [[provincial temple]] in each province.<ref name="sanpo-h">{{cite book|last1=Chiba-ken Kōtō Gakkō Kyōiku Kenkyūkai. Rekishi Bukai. |title=Chiba-ken no rekishi sanpo (千葉県の歴史散步) |publisher=Yamakawa Shuppansha |year=1989 |location=Tokyo |pages=3–4 |language=ja |isbn=9784634291201}}</ref>

===Heian period===
The imperial court gradually extended its authority over the three provinces in the [[Nara period|Nara]] (710–794) and [[Heian period|Heian]] (794–1185) periods. [[Shōen]] feudal estates were established across the three provinces, and the region became an important source of tax revenue, sending agricultural and other products to the capital in Kyoto. As the Heian period progressed, however, the [[kokushi (officials)|kokushi]] provincial governors came to exert military power independent of the central government in Kyoto. The [[Chiba clan]] broke entirely with the imperial court and was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]].<ref name="sanpo-h" /><ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref>

===Modern period===
[[File:Student militia at Kujukurihama.jpg|left|thumb|Student militia of the [[Fifty-Second Army (Japan)|Japanese 52nd Army]] training on [[Kujūkuri Beach]], early 1945]]

Chiba Prefecture was established on June 15, 1873, with the merger of [[Kisarazu Prefecture]] and [[Inba Prefecture]].

The [[militarization]] of Chiba Prefecture dates to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904&ndash;1905). Coastal fortifications were built along [[Tokyo Bay]], as far south as Tateyama, to protect the capital of the [[Japanese Empire]] from attack.

In September 1923, the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kanto earthquake]] has cause of widespread destruction in Chiba Prefecture, most notably in the southernmost part of [[Bōsō Peninsula|Boso Peninsula]], where 1,300 residents were killed, out of 142,000 deaths. Areas of prefecture adjacent to Tokyo saw much damage, and mob violence against Koreans and other ethnic minorities occurred in the chaos after the earthquake in Funabashi, [[Ichikawa, Chiba|Ichikawa]], and other areas.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Chiba-ken Kōtō Gakkō Kyōiku Kenkyūkai.

Koreans, in several neighborhoods of Yachiyo, were killed, and a tower was erected in 1972 near [[Yachiyodai Station]] to memorialize those killed in the incident.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Chiba-ken Kōtō Gakkō Kyōiku Kenkyūkai.

After the United States took control of [[Saipan]], the northern part of the prefecture (most notably the cities of Chiba and Chōshi) was [[firebombed]]. Much of the industrialized north of the prefecture was destroyed. [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]], one of two parts of [[Operation Downfall]], was the planned land invasion of Tokyo in March 1946 by the United States. Coronet planned [[Kujūkuri Beach]] as one of two initial landing bases, the other being [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa|Hiratsuka]] via [[Sagami Bay]]. The [[U.S. First Army]] would enter at Kujūkuri, sweep across the Boso Peninsula, and meet the [[U.S. Eighth Army]] at Tokyo. The plan was not carried out since [[surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Giangreco | first = D.

[[File:Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works.jpg|right|thumb|Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works, 2007, Kimitsu, Keiyō Industrial Zone]]

During the [[Occupation of Japan]] (1945&ndash;1952) Chiba Prefecture was controlled by American forces from the second floor of the prefectural capitol building in the city of Chiba. Numerous other cities in the prefecture, including Chōshi to the north and Tateyama to the south, were used as bases of the occupation; rich agricultural areas across the prefecture somewhat safeguarded the region's population from potential food shortages, and starvation, immediately following the war. The immediate post-war period was characterized by carefully planned industrial expansion in the north of the prefecture, and the significant increase of agriculture after [[land reform]]s across the prefecture. The [[Keiyō Industrial Zone]] brought together smaller, industrial areas along the entirety of the western coast of Chiba Prefecture, and the industrial zone became (and remains) an important center of heavy industrial production and large-scale port facilities in Japan. Cities to the northeast of the prefecture (in close proximity to Tokyo) were connected by rail to the capitol, and became and remain [[bedroom communities]] to Tokyo. [[Narita International Airport]] began operation in 1978 in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]], after much protest to replace the overcrowded [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (Haneda Airport). The majority of international air traffic enters Japan via Chiba Prefecture. The cultivation of [[rice]] and vegetables to feed the [[Greater Tokyo Area|Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area]] expanded greatly and became a source of income to the northeast and central areas of the prefecture. The expansion of agriculture in the central and southern regions of the prefecture was in contrast to the depopulation of these areas as a significant part of the population moved to the northeast of the prefecture as a result of the [[urbanization]] of Japan, a process that continues into the 21st century.

On March 11, 2011, the epicenter of [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami]] and subsequent [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu, which caused some damage and affected areas in Chiba Prefecture. While the loss of life and damage to housing and industry was far less than in [[Tōhoku region]], 20 people were killed in Chiba Prefecture, including 13 people were recorded deaths in [[Asahi, Chiba|Asahi]]. Following the triple disaster, an [[oil refinery]] fire broke out at the [[Cosmo Oil]] Chiba Refinery, in [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]], and was widely covered in the news media. Also, a large [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) tanks burned at 10 days earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmo-oil.co.jp/eng/information/110321/index.html|title=LPG Tanks Fire Extinguished at Chiba Refinery (5th Update)|publisher=Cosmo Energy Holdings|date=March 21, 2011}}</ref> [[Soil liquefaction]], in areas of [[reclaimed land]] across the northern and western areas of Chiba Prefecture, caused damage to housing.<ref name="japantimeslf">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120330f1.html|title=Liquefaction driving away Chiba residents|last=Fukue|first=Natsuko|work=[[Japan Times]]|date=30 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401075038/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120330f1.html|archive-date=1 April 2012}}</ref> [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba City]], [[Funabashi, Chiba|Funabashi]], [[Narashino, Chiba|Narashino]], and especially [[Urayasu, Chiba|Urayasu]] were greatly affected by triple disaster (such as soil liquefaction, and evidence of radioactive materials caused by the Fukushima radiation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110409002397.htm|title=Liquefaction damage widespread|work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]|date=10 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411081158/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110409002397.htm|archive-date=11 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110408f3.html|title=Urayasu still dealing with liquefaction|last=Fukue|first=Natsuko|work=[[Japan Times]]|date=8 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410212330/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110408f3.html |url-status=dead|archive-date=10 April 2011}}</ref> As a result of triple disaster and with permanent damage to housing stock, the population of Chiba Prefecture fell for the first time since [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu pandemic]] in 1918 and [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kanto earthquake]] in 1923.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120208003386.htm|title=Foreigner exodus spurs Chiba population decline|work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]|date=9 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212003247/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120208003386.htm|archive-date=12 February 2012}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Chiba Prefecture borders [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] to the north at the Tone River, [[Tokyo]] and [[Saitama Prefecture]] to the west at the Edo River, the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east and [[Tokyo Bay]] around its southern boundary. Most of Chiba lies on the hilly [[Boso Peninsula]], a [[rice]] farming region: the east coast, known as the [[Kujūkuri Plain]],<ref name="dijitaru-kujukuriheino">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dijitaru daijisen |title=九十九里平野 (Kujūri Heino) |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-09 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> is an especially productive area. The most populous zone, in the northwest of the prefecture, is part of the [[Kantō region]] that extends into the urban agglomeration of Tokyo and Saitama. The [[Kuroshio Current]] flows near Chiba, which keeps it relatively warm in winter and cooler in summer than neighbouring Tokyo.

=== National and prefectural parks ===

With the exception of the large-scale [[Keiyō Industrial Zone]] in the northeast, the entirety of the coast of Chiba Prefecture is protected as two quasi-national parks and one prefectural natural park under the national park system of Japan. As of 1 April 2012, 6% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |access-date=26 April 2012}}</ref>

*[[Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park]] encompasses a large area of the [[Tone River]] basin and the area around [[Mount Tsukuba]] in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]. The park was established in 1953 to protect not only the environment of the area, but also its unique cultural heritage. The mouth of the Tone River and to [[Cape Inubō]] and [[Byōbugaura]] in northeastern Chiba Prefecture make up the southern part of the park.<ref name="nipponika-suigo">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) (日本大百科全書(ニッポニカ) |title=Suigō-Tsukuba Kokutei Kōen (水郷筑波国定公園) |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-09 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref>

===Mergers===
{{main|List of mergers in Chiba Prefecture}}
With the introduction of [[Municipalities of Japan|modern municipalities (cities/towns/villages)]] in 1889, Chiba's districts were subdivided into 43 towns and 315 villages. The first city was created in 1921 when Chiba Town from Chiba District became district-independent as Chiba City. The postwar/1950s Great Shōwa mergers reduced the number of municipalities in Chiba to 101 by 1960, including 14 cities by then. The early 3rd millennium Great Heisei mergers created the current 54 municipalities by 2010.

===Industry===
Chiba Prefecture is home to one of Japan's largest industrial areas. Prior to [[World War II]] manufacturing in the prefecture was centered on the [[brewing industry]], specifically the production of [[soy sauce]], [[sake]] and [[mirin]] sweet cooking sake. The [[manufacturing]] sector expanded greatly after the war. The prefecture was chosen as the site for a major [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki Steel]] factory in 1950. In the same period the prefectural government embarked on a large-scale [[land reclamation]] program to [[dredging|dredge]] large plots of waterfront property. The large-scale construction of [[factory|factories]], [[warehouses]], and [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s on this reclaimed land around the Tokyo Bay area ultimately formed the [[Keiyō Industrial Zone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2008/venue/chiba_02.html|title=Chiba Industry|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan}}</ref> Chiba Prefecture is now 6th in Japan in [[industrial production|industrial output]] with the bulk of the industry focused on the [[petroleum industry|petroleum]], [[chemical industry|chemical]], and [[steel industry|steel]] and [[machine industries]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/english/outline/industry.html |title=Industry in Chiba Prefecture |publisher=Chiba Prefectural Government |access-date=2015-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304013345/http://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/english/outline/industry.html |archive-date=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Together, these industries account for forty-five percent of the prefecture's exports. In recent years, the government has funded more than eighty [[industrial park]]s to bring development further inland as well.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Working in the Rice Paddies in May.jpg|right|thumb|Rice production, Sawara, [[Katori, Chiba|Katori]]]]

The prefecture also boasts Japan's overall second-highest agricultural output.

The [[Chiba Prefectural Museum of Art]] is in Chiba City. The [[Chiba Prefectural Boso-no-mura]] in Sakae focuses on the local culture of the late Edo period, and the [[Chiba Prefectural Otone Museum]] in Katori focuses on the culture of the [[Tone River]] basin. The reconstructed [[Japanese castle]]s of [[Sekiyado Castle|Sekiyado]] and [[Ōtaki Castle (Chiba)|Ōtaki]] host regional historical museums.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Big rolled sushi,Hutomakizushi,Katori-city,Chiba,Japan.JPG|thumb|''Futomaki'', large sushi rolls, Katori, Chiba Prefecture]]
[[File:Seaweed-dish,kaisou,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|''Kaisō'', a jelly-like food made from the seaweed ''Chondrus elatus''. Believed to have originated in [[Chōshi]] city]]

The traditional diet of Chiba Prefecture is not fundamentally different from that of the rest of Japan. Chiba Prefecture produces prolific quantities of rice across all areas in the prefecture, vegetables in the northern area of the prefecture, and fish, seafood, and shellfish along the coastal areas of the prefecture. Chōshi has been a major center of worldwide [[soy sauce]] production since the [[Edo period]], and the prefecture remains the top producer in Japan. [[Kikkoman]] is headquartered in Noda in northwestern Chiba Prefecture.<ref name="trends"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kikkoman.com/corporateprofile/directory/japan.shtml |title=Kikkoman Corporate Profile |access-date=2012-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326071713/http://www.kikkoman.com/corporateprofile/directory/japan.shtml |archive-date=2012-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These are all important components of [[Japanese cuisine]].

Certain local products, however, are grown in abundance and have resulted in several dishes unique to the areas. Peanuts, grown in great quantities in the prefecture, appear fresh in markets in the prefecture and are eaten boiled as a snack. [[Miso]] paste mixed with peanuts is also produced in Chiba.<ref name="trends"/> ''Takenoko'', whole [[bamboo shoot]], are harvested in the central part of the Boso Peninsula. The takenoko of Ōtaki lack the concentration of [[arsenic]] typically found in uncooked bamboo shoots, and as such, are uniquely eaten raw in the area as "takenoko sashimi".<ref>[http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/syokusai/contents/nextweek/0226/ 第271回『たけのこ』春の息吹　たけのこ4月18日放送予定] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607192734/https://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/syokusai/contents/nextweek/0226/ |date=2020-06-07 }}{{in lang|ja}}</ref><ref name="tour">{{Cite web |url=http://www.chiba-tour.jp/html/food-country_en.html |title=Country Dishes of Chiba Prefecture |access-date=2012-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701084437/http://www.chiba-tour.jp/html/food-country_en.html |archive-date=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Futomaki]]'' or ''futomakizushi'', literally "fat roll", is a large version of the sushi roll. The futomaki popularly made in Chiba Prefecture is up to 10 centimeters in diameter. Futomaki in Chiba Prefecture often utilize various ingredients to form a pattern, such as a flower or a [[kanji]] character, when the roll is cut and served.<ref name="trends"/><ref name="tour"/>

== Politics ==
[[File:ChibaKencho.jpg|thumb|Main building of the prefectural government in Chiba City]]
[[File:Chiba Prefectural Assembly Hall.jpg|thumb|The prefectural assembly building]]
Since 2009, the prefectural governor<ref>Chiba Prefecture: [https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kensei/kennogoannnai/chijishitsu/index.html Governor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703001103/http://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kensei/kennogoannnai/chijishitsu/index.html |date=2015-07-03 }} {{in lang|ja}}</ref> is Eiji Suzuki<!--has to use his real name when performing in legal terms strictly official acts as prefectural governor of Chiba, e.g. when signing official documents, but other than that generally uses his stage name in public, also in his role as governor: https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/seihou/chijishitsu/shimei/index.html!-->, better known under his stage name as [[Kensaku Morita]], former actor, member of the House of Representatives ([[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]]/Independent – Tokyo 4th district) and member of the House of Councillors (Independent – Tokyo). He was reelected overwhelmingly to a second term as governor in the [[2013 Chiba gubernatorial election|March 2013 election]] against only a Communist challenger and a minor, unaffiliated independent.

[[Chiba Prefectural Assembly|The assembly of Chiba Prefecture]]<ref>Chiba Prefecture: [https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/gikai/ Assembly] {{in lang|ja}}</ref> has a regular membership of 95, elected in 45 electoral districts, currently still in the unified local election cycle of 1947 (last round [[2011 Japanese unified local elections|2011]]). As of July 2014, it is composed as follows: LDP 52 members, [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|DPJ]] 13, [[Kōmeitō]] 7, [[Japanese Communist Party|JCP]] 4, Shimin Net/[[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|SDP]]/Independents 4, [[Your Party]] 3, four other caucuses with 5 members in total.<ref>Prefectural assembly: [https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/gikai/giji/giin/kaihabetsu.html Members by caucus] {{in lang|ja}}</ref>

In the [[National Diet]], Chiba is represented by 13 members from single-member districts in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], and six members (three at-large per election) in the [[House of Councillors]]. After the most recent Diet elections of 2010, 2012 and 2013, the prefecture is represented by eleven Liberal Democrats and two Democrats in the House of Representatives, and three Liberal Democrats, two Democrats, and one Your Party member in the House of Councillors.

===Local government===
As of 2014, Chiba is divided into 54 contiguous [[Municipalities of Japan|municipalities]] (see list above): 37 cities, 16 towns and one village,<ref>Chiba Prefecture, [https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kensei/kennogoannnai/chiiki/shichouson/index.html Municipalities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929195815/https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kensei/kennogoannnai/chiiki/shichouson/index.html |date=2015-09-29 }}: [https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kouhou/ichiran.html List], [https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kouhou/map.html Map]</ref> as in all of postwar Japan each with a directly elected mayor and assembly. The most populous and Chiba's only [[Designated city|designated major city]] is the capital [[Chiba City]]. Two cities, Funabashi and Kashiwa, are [[Core cities of Japan|core cities]]. After late 20th century mergers, much of the rest of the prefecture is also organized in independent [[Cities of Japan|cities]]: Of the (today purely geographical) [[Counties of Japan|counties]], only six remain, four of which have only one or two remaining [[Towns of Japan|towns]] or [[Villages of Japan|villages]]. After the reorganization of county and municipal governments in all prefectures in 1889/1890, there had initially been 12 counties and no city in Chiba;<ref>[http://www.tt.rim.or.jp/~ishato/tiri/gun/map/1900/12tiba.htm Chiba's counties and cities in 1900] {{in lang|ja}}</ref> Chiba town in Chiba county became the first municipality in Chiba to be elevated to city status in 1921.
