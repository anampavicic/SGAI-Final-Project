The lighthouse built in 1842 marked the beginning of the history of harbour development in the city. Thoothukudi was established as a Municipality in 1866 with [[J. L. P. Roche Victoria|J.M.B. Roche Victoria]] as its first chairman.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Joseph |first=J Praveen Paul |date=22 July 2014 |title=The Tuticorin-Sri Lanka link |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-tuticorinsri-lanka-link/article6236885.ece |access-date=14 September 2024 |work=The Hindu |language=en-IN |issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

Thoothukudi comes under the Thoothukudi Telecom District of the [[Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited]] (BSNL), India's state-owned telecom and internet services provider. Both Global System for Mobile Communications ([[GSM]]) and [[Code division multiple access]] (CDMA) mobile services are available. Apart from telecom, BSNL also provides [[broadband internet]] service.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bsnl.co.in/service/broadband_list_of_cities.pdf |title=List of cities where BSNL broadband service is available (As on 01.01.2007) |year=2007 |publisher=Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204070855/http://www.bsnl.co.in/service/broadband_list_of_cities.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2007 |access-date=29 December 2012}}</ref> Thoothukudi is one of the few cities in India where BSNL's Caller Line Identification (CLI) based internet service Netone is available.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bsnl.co.in/service/cities_cli.htm |title=List of cities where Calling Line Identification (CLI) Based Internet Service is available |year=2007 |publisher=Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308094431/http://www.bsnl.co.in/service/cities_cli.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012 |access-date=29 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Environmental Issues ==
Air Pollution is the major environmental challenge faced by Thoothukudi while water and noise pollution are environmental issues too. Thoothukudi is the only city from the state of Tamil Nadu to be listed as one of the Non-attainment cities by Ministry of Environment primarily on the basis of excess [[PM10]] under the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Program (NAMP) for the period 2011 - 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cpcb.nic.in/uploads/Non-Attainment_Cities.pdf |title=Non Attainment Cities India}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/aug/05/thoothukudi-sole-city-from-tn-to-have-high-levels-of-air-pollution-1853528.html |title=thoothukudi-sole-city-from-tn-to-have-high-levels-of-air-pollution}}</ref>

The city has a lot of red industries as a result of which the [[PM10]] — tiny airborne particles seven times finer than human hair–exceeds national standards (60 micrograms per cubic metre, or μg/m<sup>3</sup>) by around 200 per cent. Indian Standards for [[PM10]] is three times higher than WHO standards for PM10 particles which is 20 micrograms per cubic metre. Environmentalists blame public and private coal-fired thermal power plants, copper smelter and chemical industries for polluting the air quality of Thoothukudi.

A 2010 study<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://updatepublishing.com/journal/index.php/jebt/article/view/29/29 |title=Impact of environmental pollution on health: A sociological study in Tuticorin industrial town, TN, India|journal=Journal of Ecobiotechnology|date=28 June 2010|last1=Maharajan|first1=K.|last2=Samual|first2=Kirubakaran}}</ref>{{predatory publisher}} published in the Journal of Ecobiotechnology cites Industrial pollution in Thoothukudi as a major cause for various health issues. Respondents of the study had various health issues like [[Cutaneous condition|skin diseases]], eye irritation, [[asthma]], [[allergy]], [[Respiratory disease|respiratory problems]], [[cancer]] and [[hypertension]]. The study also observed that Industrial disposals and other chemical contaminates that enter waterways through agricultural runoff, storm water drains, and industrial discharges may persist in the environment for long periods and be transported by water or air over long distances. They disturbed the function of the endocrine system, resulting in reproductive, developmental, and behavioral problems. The [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupters]] reduced the fertility and increased the occurrence of still births, birth defects, and hormonally dependent Cancers such as breast, testicular, and prostate cancers. The effects on the developing nervous system can include impaired mental and psychomotor development, as well as cognitive impairment and behavior abnormalities. Studies like these led the people of Thoothukudi to protest for the closing of the Sterlite plant in May 2018. On the 22nd of that month, the police [[Thoothukudi massacre|opened fire]] on protestors killing 13 and injuring 102. The plant was soon closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-sterlite-protest-live-updates-tuticorin-thoothukudi-death-toll-vedanta-copper-plant-443641|title=Anti-Sterlite protests: 13 dead, 102 injured in Thoothukudi; electricity supply to Sterlite Industries cut off {{!}} As it happened|last=Shantanu|first=Shashank|date=2018-05-24|website=www.indiatvnews.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>
