'''Bardhaman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|d|ə|ˌ|m|ɑː|n|}}, {{IPA|bn|ˈbɔrˌd̪ʱo.man|lang|}}), officially '''Bardhaman Sadar''', is a city and  municipality in the state of [[West Bengal]], India. It is the headquarters of [[Purba Bardhaman district]], having become a district capital during the [[British India|period of British rule]]. '''Burdwan''', an alternative name for the city, has remained in use since then.

==Etymology==
The history of Burdwan is known from about 5000 BC (the Mesolithic or Late Stone Age).<ref>{{Cite web |title=History and Background |url=https://purbabardhaman.nic.in/history/ |website=Purba Bardhaman District, Government of West Bengal, India |access-date=30 April 2024}}</ref> The origin of this name dates back to the sixth century BCE and is ascribed to Vardhamāna or [[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]] (599-527 BCE), the 24th [[Tirthankara|Tīrthāṅkara]] of [[Jainism]], who spent some time in Astikagrama, according to the Jain scripture of [[Kalpa Sūtra]]. This place was renamed as ''Vardhamana'' in his honour.

==History==
During the period of Jahangir this place was named Badh-e-dewan (district capital). The city owes its historical importance to being the headquarters of the Maharajas of Burdwan, the premier noblemen of lower Bengal, whose rent-roll was upwards of 300,000. [[Bardhaman Raj]] was founded in 1657 by Sangam Rai, of a Hindu Khatri family of Kotli in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]], whose descendants served in turn the [[Mughal Emperor]]s and the [[British government]]. The [[East Indian Railway]] from [[Howrah]] was opened in 1855. The great prosperity of the raj was due to the excellent management of Maharaja Mahtab Chand (died 1879), whose loyalty to the government especially during the "Hul" ([[Santhal rebellion]]) of 1855-56 and the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] was rewarded with the grant of a coat of arms in 1868 and the right to a personal salute of 13 guns in 1877. Maharaja [[Bijaychand Mahtab]] (born 1881), who succeeded his adoptive father in 1888, earned great distinction by the courage with which he risked his life to save that of [[Sir Andrew Fraser]], the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, on the occasion of the attempt to assassinate him made by freedom fighters of Bengal on 7 November 1908.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Burdwan|volume=4|page=811}}</ref>

Mahtab Chand Bahadur and later Bijoy Chand Mahtab struggled their best to make this region culturally, economically and ecologically healthier. The chief educational institution was the Burdwan Raj College, which was entirely supported out of the maharaja's estate. [[Kamalakanta Bhattacharya (West Bengal)|Sadhak Kamalakanta]] as composer of devotional songs and Kashiram Das as a poet and translator of the great [[Mahabharata]] were possibly the best products of such an endeavour. Pratap Chandra Roy was the publisher of the first translation in the world to translate [[Mahabharata]] in English (1883–1896).<ref name=tra>{{cite book |title=The Mahabharata Book 1: Adi Parva |author= Kisari Mohan Ganguli tr.|chapter= Translator's Preface|year=1883|page=xii |chapter-url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01001.htm}}</ref> The society at large also continued to gain the fruits. We find, among others, the great rebel poet [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] and Kala-azar-famed U. N. Brahmachari as the relatively recent illustrious sons of this soil. [[Batukeshwar Dutt]] an Indian revolutionary and independence fighter in the early 1900s was born on 18 November 1910 in a village Oari in Burdwan district. He is best known for having exploded a few bombs, along with [[Bhagat Singh]], in the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi on 8 April 1929. The city became an important centre of North-[[Indian classical music]] as well.

==Culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Bardhaman has a multi-cultural heritage. The [[deul]]s (temples of [[rekha]] type) found here are reminiscent of Bengali Hindu architecture. The old temples bear signs of [[Hinduism]], mostly belonging to the [[Shakti|Sakta]] and [[Vaishnava]] followers.

The Kankaleswari [[Kali]] is also located in the city of Bardhaman. Bardhaman experienced and survived numerous violent conflicts, due to [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Maratha]] invaders. The city of Bardhaman was visited by notables of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] from Raja Todarmal to Daud Karnani, from Sher Afghan and Kutub-ud-din to Ajimuswan to the future Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]] while he was still a rebel. Bardhaman also has a number of Bengali Christians, and although they are a minority, there are many churches in the city.

==Education==

===University===
The [[University of Burdwan]] was formally inaugurated on 15 June 1960 by [[Sukumar Sen (civil servant)|Sukumar Sen]], its first Vice-chancellor. It was after the abolition of the [[Zamindar]]i system in the fifties that [[Bardhaman Raj#Udaychand Mahtab|Uday Chand Mahtab]], the last representative of the Burdwan Raj, left his entire property in Burdwan to the state government. This, coupled with the initiative of the then [[Chief Minister of West Bengal]], [[Bidhan Chandra Roy]], facilitated the establishment of this university. Presently, the administrative works are mostly done at the Rajbati (the palace of Barddhamana Maharaja) campus; on the other hand, academic activities centre on the Golapbag campus. With social responsibilities in mind, the university actively patronised the construction of a science centre and the Meghnad Saha Planetarium.
