'''Oxnard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|k|s|n|ɑːr|d|audio=En-us-oxnard.ogg}}) is a city in [[Ventura County]] in the U.S. state of [[California]], United States. On California's [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]], it is the most populous city in Ventura County and the [[List of largest California cities by population|22nd-most-populous city]] in California. Incorporated in 1903, Oxnard lies approximately {{convert|60|miles}} northwest of downtown [[Los Angeles]].

It is at the western edge of the fertile [[Oxnard Plain]], adjacent to agricultural fields with strawberries, [[lima bean]]s and other vegetable crops. Oxnard is also a major transportation hub in [[Southern California]], with [[Amtrak]], [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]], [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], and Intercalifornias stopping there. It also has a small regional airport, [[Oxnard Airport]] (OXR). The town also has significant connections to the nearby oil fields  [[Oxnard Oil Field]] and the [[West Montalvo Oil Field]]. The high density of oil, industry, and agricultural activities around the city, has led to several [[Environmental issues in California|environmental issues]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |date=July 9, 2017 |title=Oxnard residents are fighting slag heaps, power plants and oil fields that mar the town's beaches |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-oxnard-coast-20170605-story.html |access-date=May 26, 2022 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2022}}
[[File:Carte du Ranch d' El Rio de Santa Clara o la Colonia.jpg|thumb|left|Oxnard was originally a part of [[Rancho El Rio de Santa Clara o la Colonia]], granted in 1837 by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado|Governor Alvarado]] to seven retired soldiers from the [[Presidio of Santa Barbara]].]]
[[File:Oxnard-1900s.jpg|left|upright=1.25|thumb|Downtown Oxnard, early 1900s]]

Before the arrival of Europeans, the area was inhabited by [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] Native Americans. The first European to encounter the area was explorer [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], who claimed it for [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1542. During the [[Spanish missions in California|mission period]], [[Mission San Buenaventura]], established in 1782, used the area for raising cattle.

Ranching began to take hold among [[Californio]] settlers, who lost their regional influence when California became a US state in 1850. At about the same time, the area was settled by American farmers, who cultivated [[barley]] and lima beans.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Drury |first=Wells |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQtFAAAAIAAJ |title=California Tourist Guide and Handbook: Authentic Description of Routes of Travel and Points of Interest in California |last2=Drury |first2=Aubrey |date= |publisher=Western guidebook Company |year=1913 |pages=132 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Henry T. Oxnard]], founder of [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]-based [[American Crystal Sugar Company]] who operated a successful [[sugar beet]] factory with his three brothers (Benjamin, James, and Robert) in [[Chino, California]], was enticed to build a $2 million factory on the plain inland from [[Port Hueneme]].<ref>{{citation|title=Oxnard, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=puooAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA59|work=The Louisiana Planter and Sugar Manufacturer|date=July 5, 1902|issue=XXIX No. 1|page=59|department=BEET SUGAR |access-date=January 23, 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> Shortly after the 1897 beet campaign, a new town emerged, now commemorated on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Ventura County, California|National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Henry T. Oxnard Historic District]]. Oxnard intended to name the settlement after the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "sugar", ''zachari'', but frustrated by bureaucracy, named it after himself. Given the potential growth of Oxnard, in the spring of 1898, a railroad station was built to service the plant, attracting a population of Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican laborers and enough commerce to merit the designation of a town. The Oxnard brothers, who never lived in their namesake city, sold the Chino and the giant red-brick Oxnard factory in 1899 for nearly $4 million. The Oxnard factory, with its landmark twin smokestacks, operated from August 19, 1899, until October 26, 1959. Factory operations were interrupted in the [[Oxnard Strike of 1903]].

In the mid-20th century, Oxnard grew and developed the areas outside the downtown area, including homes, industry, retail, and a new harbor named [[Channel Islands Harbor]]. [[Martin V.

==Geography==
Oxnard is located on the Oxnard Plain, an area with fertile soil. With its beaches, dunes, wetlands, creeks, and the [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara River]], the area contains several critical biological communities. Native plant communities include: [[coastal sage scrub]], California Annual Grassland, and Coastal Dune Scrub species; however, most native plants have been eliminated from within the city limits to make way for agriculture and urban and industrial development. Also native to the region is the endangered [[Ventura Marsh Milkvetch]], and the last self-sustaining population is in Oxnard in the center of an approved housing development.<ref name="Centerforplantconservation.org">{{cite web |url=http://saveplants.org/plant-detail-page/?plant_id=475 |title=''Astragalus pycnostachyus'' var.

===Rivers===
The [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara River]] separates Oxnard and Ventura. Tributaries to this river include [[Sespe Creek]], [[Piru Creek]], and [[Castaic Creek]].

===Geology===

Oxnard is on a [[tectonics|tectonically]] active plate since most of [[Coastal California]] is near the boundaries between the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] Plates. The [[San Andreas Fault]], which demarcates this boundary, is about 40 miles away.

One active [[Fault (geology)|fault]] that transverses Oxnard is the [[Oak Ridge Fault]], which straddles the [[Santa Clara River Valley]] westward from the [[Santa Susana Mountains]], crosses the [[Oxnard Plain]] through Oxnard, and extends into the [[Santa Barbara Channel]]. The coastline is subject to inundation by a [[tsunami]] up to 23 feet in height.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Ventura-Oxnard-Tsunami-Risk-Earthquake-Fault-Study-322388791.html|title=Ventura, Oxnard Might Be at Greater Tsunami Risk: Study|agency=Associated Press|last=Lloyd|first=Jonathan|via=NBC Southern California|language=en|date=August 20, 2015|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref>

The fault has significantly contributed to [[Seismology|seismic]] activity in the Oxnard region and beyond. The January 17, 1994,  6.7 {{M|w}} [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]] is believed to have occurred in the Santa Clarita extension of the Oak Ridge Fault. [[Landslide]]s and ridge-top shattering resulting from the Northridge earthquake were observed above [[Moorpark]], a city {{convert|19.6|mi|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Distance from Oxnard, CA to Moorpark, CA by car, bike, walk|url=http://www.usageo.org/distance/654652-649138|website=www.usageo.org|publisher=USAGeo.org|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref> east of Oxnard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpacorn.com/News/2004 |title=MPAcorn.com |publisher=MPAcorn.com |access-date=November 13, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Climate===
Oxnard is the location of the [[National Weather Service]] forecast office that serves the Los Angeles area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/lox|title=National Weather Service Los Angeles/Oxnard|access-date=May 30, 2016}}</ref> The city is situated in a [[Mediterranean]] (dry [[subtropical]]) climate zone, experiencing mild and relatively wet winters, and warm, dry summers, in a climate called the [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]].

The average minimum temperature is {{convert|52|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and the average maximum temperature is {{convert|69|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

===Wildlife and ecology===
{{see also|California coastal sage and chaparral}}
The area contains several critical biological communities. Native plant communities include [[coastal sage scrub]], California Annual Grassland, and Coastal Dune Scrub species; most native plants have been eliminated from within the city limits to make way for development. Also native to the region is the endangered [[Ventura Marsh Milkvetch]], with the last self-sustaining population in Oxnard being at the center of a housing development.<ref name="Centerforplantconservation.org"/>

The balance of wildlife in Oxnard is similar to most places in southern California, with small mammals being common in urbanized areas, like squirrels, raccoons, and skunks. Coyotes prey on these smaller mammals. Small birds and mammals can be food for stray, feral, and pet dogs and cats.<ref>Wolch, West and Gaines ''Transspecies Urban Theory'' from Satiety and Space 1995. volume 13, pages 735–760</ref>

[[Pesticides]] are used in the agricultural fields surrounding Oxnard, as the area is one of the nation's leading [[strawberry]] producers, with agriculture being one of the top contributors to Oxnard's economy.
