'''Malacca City''' ({{lang-ms|Bandaraya Melaka}} or ''{{lang|ms|Kota Melaka}}'') is the [[List of capitals in Malaysia|capital city]] of the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Malacca]], in [[Melaka Tengah District]]. It is [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|the oldest Malaysian city]] on the [[Straits of Malacca]], having become a successful [[entrepôt]] in the era of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The present-day city was founded by [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]], a Sumatran prince who escaped to the [[Malay Peninsula]] when [[Srivijaya]] fell to the [[Majapahit]]. Following the establishment of the Malacca Sultanate, the city drew the attention of traders from the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, as well as the Portuguese, who intended to dominate the trade route in Asia. After Malacca was conquered by [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the city became an area of conflict when the sultanates of [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]] and [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] attempted to take control from the Portuguese.

Following a number of wars between these territories, Aceh declined in influence while Johor survived and expanded its influence over territory previously lost to Aceh in Sumatra when [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|Johor co-operated with the Dutch]] to take Malacca from the Portuguese who arrived to establish dominance over [[Java]] and [[Maluku Islands]]. However, due to royal internal strife between the Malay and Bugis, the Johor-Riau Empire was divided into the sultanates of Johor and [[Riau–Lingga Sultanate|Riau-Lingga]]. This separation became permanent when the British arrived to establish their presence in the Malay Peninsula. The Dutch, who already felt threatened in the presence of the British, began conquering the Riau-Lingga Sultanate along with the rest of Sumatra, while Johor came under British influence following the signing of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]].

When the British succeeded in extending their influence over the Malay Peninsula, the city soon became an area of development under the [[Straits Settlements]] as part of the [[British Empire]]. The development and burgeoning prosperity were, however, halted when the Japanese arrived in [[World War II]] and [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|occupied]] the area from 1942 to 1945. During the occupation, many of the city's residents were taken and forced to construct the [[Burma Railway|Death Railway]] in [[State of Burma|Burma]] (present-day [[Myanmar]]). After the war, the city was returned to the British and remained as the capital of Malacca. The status as a capital remained until the formation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, and in 2008 it was listed, together with [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] of [[Penang]], as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] for its long history.<ref name="UNESCO Heritage">{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/450|title=Eight new sites, from the Straits of Malacca, to Papua New Guinea and San Marino, added to UNESCO's World Heritage List|publisher=[[UNESCO]] ([[World Heritage Site]])|date=7 July 2008|access-date=8 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906101950/https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/450/|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=dead}}.</ref> As of 2019 it has a population of 579,000.<ref name="dosm.gov.my">{{Cite web |date= |title=DOSM_DOSM_MELAKA_1_2020_Siri-81 |url=https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/uploads/files/6_Newsletter/Newsletter%202020/DOSM_DOSM_MELAKA_1_2020_Siri-81.pdf |access-date=2023-06-29 |website=dosm.gov.my |language=ms}}</ref>

The economy of Malacca City is largely based on tourism. As the economic centre of the state of [[Malacca]], it also hosts several international conferences and trade fairs. The city is located along the [[Maritime Silk Road]], proposed by China in 2013. Among the tourist attractions in Malacca City are [[Fortress of Malacca|Porta de Santiago]], [[Jonker Walk]], [[Little India, Malacca|Little India]], [[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Portuguese Settlement]], [[Stadthuys]], [[Maritime Museum (Malaysia)|Maritime Museum]], [[Christ Church, Malacca|Christ Church]], [[Malacca Sultanate Palace Museum]] and [[Taming Sari Tower]].

There are at least two other theories on the origin the naming of Malacca: Tomé Pires explains the name in the ''Suma Oriental'' as a transliteration of the term for a fugitive, ''Malaqa'', reflecting Parameswara's history as one, and the ''Malay Annals'' themselves suggest that Arab merchants called the kingdom ''Malakat'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] for 'congregation of merchants') during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah of Malacca|Muhammad Shah]] (1424–1444), because it was home to many trading communities.<ref name=cbkheng>{{cite journal |last1=Cheah |first1=Boon Kheng|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Melakan Empire: Moral Judgement in Tun Bambang's "Sejarah Melayu" |journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |date=1998 |volume=71 |issue=2 (275) |pages=109 |jstor=41493366 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41493366}}</ref>

===Founding of Malacca===
Malacca was established when [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]], who had escaped from [[Palembang]] in Sumatra, decided to build a new kingdom following Malay [[Srivijaya]]'s fall in 1377 after being attacked by Javanese [[Majapahit]].<ref name="Yagnik2011"/><ref name="Parameswara">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/a9cbdbfe-e4d4-4aca-ab91-b357bd419bf4|title=Sri Tri Buana/Parameswara|publisher=[[National Library Board]]|year=1299|access-date=29 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929022613/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/a9cbdbfe-e4d4-4aca-ab91-b357bd419bf4|archive-date=29 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Before he reached the site, he arrived in [[Temasek]], which he decided to make the centre of the new Malay Kingdom's administration.

Parameswara continue his journey to the north, where he reportedly visited Sening Ujong (now [[Sungai Ujong]]) before arriving at a Malay fishing village at the mouth of Bertam River (now [[Malacca River]]). He decided to stop there to rest. While he was resting under a tree, he saw his follower's hunting dogs fighting with a small mouse deer before they were kicked into a river by the deer.<ref name="Yagnik2011"/> Amused by this, he thought the place he rested must be an unusual place; following this event, in 1396 he announced the place would be called ''Malaka''.<ref name="KohPh.D.2009">{{cite book|author1=Jaime Koh|author2=Stephanie Ho PhD|title=Culture and Customs of Singapore and Malaysia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWlFCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA9|date=22 June 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35116-7|pages=9–}}</ref> Soon, the site became the centre of the [[Malay world]] in the 15th and 16th centuries and the most prosperous [[entrepôt]] in the Malay Archipelago.<ref name="Freeman2003">{{cite book|author=Donald B.

{{blockquote|Malacca was a well-established city surrounded by a [[palisade]] with four gates and watch towers. Inside the walled towers was a second fortification, a kind of [[citadel]], within whose confines were the merchants' godowns, the treasury and food storehouses. The [[Malacca River]] divided the city into two almost equal halves, the southern half being the inner citadel and the ruler's compound and the northern half, reached by a bridge some distance from the river mouth, containing the residents of many foreign merchants. The bridge and its approaches comprised the main venue for all commercial kinds. Constructed on the bridge was about a score of market stalls: an easy location for small watercraft to reach with their loads of produce and also close to the docks where foreign sea-going vessels unloaded goods for transhipment.<ref name="Freeman2003"/>|[[Ma Huan]], Chinese Muslim voyager and translator.}}
