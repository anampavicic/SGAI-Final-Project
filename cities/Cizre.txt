Cizre was founded as Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in the 9th century by [[Taghlib#Abbasid period|Al-Hasan ibn Umar]], [[List of rulers of Mosul|Emir of Mosul]], on a manmade island in the Tigris.{{sfnp|Nicolle|2013|p=227}} The city benefited from its situation as a river crossing and port in addition to its position at the end of an old Roman road which connected it to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and thus became an important commercial and strategic centre in Upper [[Mesopotamia]].{{sfnp|Nicolle|2013|p=227}} By the 12th century, it had adopted an intellectual and religious role, and sizeable Christian and Jewish communities are attested.{{sfnp|Gil|2004|p=428}}{{sfnp|Elisséeff|1986|pp=960-961}} Cizre suffered in the 15th century from multiple sackings and ultimately came under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] after 1515.{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=402}}

Under Ottoman control, Cizre stagnated and was left as a small district centre dominated by ruins by the end of the 19th century.{{sfnp|Henning|2018|p=88}} The city's decline continued, exacerbated by the state-orchestrated destruction of its Christian population in the [[Armenian genocide|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian genocide]]s in 1915,{{sfnp|Elisséeff|1986|pp=960-961}} and [[Aliyah|exodus]] of its Jewish population to [[Israel]] in 1951.{{sfnp|Mutzafi|2008|p=10}} It began to recover in the second half of the 20th century through urban redevelopment, and its population saw a massive increase as a place of refuge from 1984 onwards as many fled the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Kurdish–Turkish conflict]].{{sfnp|Marcus|1994|p=18}} At the close of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, Cizre has emerged as a battleground between Kurdish militants and the Turkish state, which inflicted significant devastation on the city to retain control.<ref name="UCTEA" />

==Etymology==
The various names for the city of Cizre descend from the original [[Arabic]] name Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar, which is derived from 'jazira' (island), "ibn" (son of), and the name Umar, thus Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar translates to 'island of the son of Umar'.{{sfnp|Rassi|2015|p=50}} The city's alternative Arabic name Madinat al-Jazira is composed of "madinat" ('city') and 'al-Jazira' (the island), and therefore translates to 'the island city'.{{sfnp|Gil|2004|p=624}} Cizre was known in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as Gāzartā d'Beṯ Zabdaï (island of Zabdicene), from 'gazarta' (island) and 'Beṯ Zabdaï' (Zabdicene).{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=112}}

Cizre is identified as the location of {{lang|la|Ad flumen Tigrim}}, a river crossing depicted on the {{Lang|la|[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]}}, a Roman 4th/5th century map.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/874296 |title=Places: 874296 (Ad flumen Tigrim) |author1=Roaf, M.|author1-link=Michael Roaf|author2=T. Sinclair|author3=S. Kroll|author4=St J. Simpson|date=27 October 2017 |access-date=22 March 2020|publisher=Pleiades}}</ref> The river crossing lay at the end of a Roman road that connected it with [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]],{{sfnp|Henning|2018|p=88}} and was part of the region of [[Zabdicene]].{{sfnp|Palmer|1990|p=xix}} It was previously assumed by most scholars that [[Bezabde]] was located at the same site of what would later become Cizre,{{sfnp|Lightfoot|1981|p=86}} but is now agreed to be at Eski Hendek, {{cvt|13|km}} northwest of Cizre.{{sfnp|Crow|2018|p=235}}

Cizre was originally known as Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar, and was founded by and named after [[Taghlib#Abbasid period|al-Hasan ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab al-Taghlibi]] (died c. 865), [[List of rulers of Mosul|Emir of Mosul]], in the early 9th century, as recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in ''Mu'jam al-Buldan''.{{sfnp|Elisséeff|1986|pp=960-961}}{{sfnp|ul-Hasan|2005|pp=40-41}} The city was constructed in a bend in the river Tigris, and al-Hasan ibn Umar built a canal across the bend, placing the city on an island in the river, hence the city's name.{{sfnp|Nicolle|2013|p=227}} Eventually, the original course of the river disappeared due to sedimentation and shifted to the canal, leaving the city on the west bank of the Tigris.{{sfnp|Lightfoot|1981|pp=88-89}} Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was situated to take advantage of trade routes from the direction of [[Diyarbakır|Amid]] to the northwest, [[Nusaybin|Nisibin]] to the west, and Iran to the northeast.{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=353}} The city also functioned as a river port, and goods were transported by raft down the Tigris to Mosul and further south.{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=385}} Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar supplanted the neighbouring city of Bezabde as its inhabitants gradually left for the new city, and was likely abandoned in the early 10th century.{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=353}}

Medieval Islamic scholars recorded competing theories of the founder of the city as [[Ali ibn abi bakr al-Harawi|al-Harawi]] noted in ''Ziyarat'' that it was believed that Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was the second city founded by [[Noah in Islam|Nuh]] ([[Noah]]) after the [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]].{{sfnp|Gil|2004|p=428}} This belief rests on the identification of nearby [[Mount Judi]] as the {{transliteration|el|apobaterion}} (place of descent) of [[Noah's Ark]].{{sfnp|Zawanowska|2019|p=36}} The [[shahanshah]] [[Ardashir I]] of [[Sasanian Empire|Iran]] (180–242) was also considered a potential founder.{{sfnp|Elisséeff|1986|pp=960–961}} In ''Wafayāt al-Aʿyān'', [[Ibn Khallikan]] reported that [[Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi]] (d. 744) was considered by some to be responsible for the city's foundation, whilst he argued that Abd al-Aziz ibn Umar was the founder and namesake of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar.{{sfnp|ul-Hasan|2005|pp=40-41}}

The city was fortified in the 10th century at the latest.{{sfnp|Nicolle|2013|p=227}} In the 10th century, [[Ibn Hawqal]] in ''Surat al-Ard'' described Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar as an entrepôt engaged in trade with the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenia]], and the districts of [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Mayyafariqin]], [[Arzen]], and Mosul.{{sfnp|Kennedy|2011|p=180}} [[Abu Taghlib]], [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] Emir of Mosul, allied himself with the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid]] Emir [[Izz al-Dawla|Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar]] of Iraq in his civil war against his cousin Emir [['Adud al-Dawla]] of Fars in 977 on the condition that Bakhtiyar hand over Abu Taghlib's younger brother Hamdan, who had conspired against him.{{sfnp|Canard|1986|p=128}} Although Abu Taghlib had secured his reign by executing his rival brother Hamdan, the alliance quickly backfired following Adud al-Dawla's victory over Abu Taghlib and Bakhtiyar at [[Samarra]] in the spring of 978 as he then annexed Hamdanid territory in upper Mesopotamia, and thus Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar came under Buyid rule, forcing Abu Taghlib to go into exile.{{sfnp|Canard|1986|p=128}}{{sfnp|Busse|2008|p=269}} Buyid control of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was cut short by the civil war that followed the death of Adud al-Dawla in 983 as it allowed the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] chief [[Badh ibn Dustak]] to seize Buyid territory in upper Mesopotamia in the following year, and he was acknowledged as its ruler by the claimant Emir [[Samsam al-Dawla]].{{sfnp|Kennedy|2004|p= 260}} Bādh attempted to conquer Mosul in 990, and the Hamdanid brothers Abu Abdallah Husayn and Abu Tahir Ibrahim were sent by the Buyid Emir [[Baha al-Dawla]] to repel the threat.{{sfnp|Kennedy|2004|pp=295–296}} The [[Uqaylid dynasty|Uqaylid]] clan agreed to aid the brothers against Bādh in return for the cities of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar, Balad, and [[Nisibin]], and Bādh was subsequently defeated and killed.{{sfnp|Kennedy|2004|pp=295–296}} The leader of the Uqaylids, [[Abu'l-Dhawwad Muhammad ibn al-Musayyab]], secured control of the cities, and acknowledged Emir Baha al-Dawla as his sovereign.{{sfnp|Kennedy|2004|pp=295-296}} On Muhammad's death in 996, his brother and successor as emir, [[al-Muqallad ibn al-Musayyab|al-Muqallad]], asserted his independence, expelling the Buyid presence in the emirate, and thus ending Buyid suzerainty.{{sfnp|Kennedy|2004|pp=295–296}}

===High medieval period===
[[Image:Mizgefta_Mezin_a_Cizîra_Botan_2009.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Grand Mosque of Cizre]]
[[Oghuz Turks|Turkmen]] nomads arrived in the vicinity of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in the summer of 1042, and carried out raids in [[Diyar Bakr]] and upper Mesopotamia.{{sfnp|Beihammer|2017|p=64}} The [[Marwanids (Diyar Bakr)|Marwanid]] emirate became a vassal of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Tughril]] in 1056.{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|p=42}}

In the summer of 1083, the former Marwanid vizier [[Fakhr al-Dawla ibn Jahir]] persuaded the Seljuk Sultan [[Malikshah]] to send him with an army against the Marwanid emirate,<ref>Ibn al-Athir, pp. 209-210</ref> and eventually Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar, the last remaining stronghold, was captured in 1085.<ref>Ibn al-Athir, p. 221</ref>{{sfnp|Beihammer|2017|p=249}} Although the Marwanid emirate was severely reduced, its final emir, Nasir al-Dawla Mansur, was permitted to continue to rule solely Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar under the Seljuk Sultanate from 1085 onwards.{{sfnp|Hillenbrand|1991|p=627}} The [[mamluk]] [[Jikirmish]] seized Mansur and usurped the emirate of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar on Mansur's death in January 1096.<ref name="Athir286-287">Ibn al-Athir, p. 286</ref> In late 1096, Jikirmish set out to relieve [[Kerbogha]]'s siege of Mosul following a request for aid from the Uqaylid emir [[Ali ibn Sharaf al-Dawla]] of Mosul, but was defeated by Kerbogha's brother Altuntash, and submitted to him as a vassal.<ref name="Athir286-287" /> Jikirmish was forced to aid in the ultimately successful siege against his former ally, and thus came under the suzerainty of Kerbogha as Emir of Mosul.<ref name="Athir286-287" /> Kerbogha died in 1102, and Sultan [[Barkiyaruq]] appointed Jikirmish as his replacement as emir.{{sfnp|Cahen|1969|pp=169-170}} Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was thereafter directly ruled over by a string of Seljuk emirs of Mosul until the appointment of Zengi.{{sfnp|Cahen|1969|pp=169-170}}

Emir [[Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi]] of Mosul was murdered by [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] in 1126, and was succeeded by his son Mas'ud. He died after several months, and his younger brother became emir with the mamluk Jawali serving as [[atabeg]] (regent).{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|pp=17-18}} Jawali sent envoys to Sultan [[Mahmud II (Seljuq sultan)|Mahmud II]] to receive official recognition for al-Bursuqi's son as emir of Mosul, but the envoys bribed the vizier Anu Shurwan to recommend [[Imad al-Din Zengi]] be appointed as emir of Mosul instead.{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|pp=17-18}} The sultan appointed Zengi as emir in the autumn of 1127, but he had to secure the emirate by force as forces loyal to al-Bursuqi's son resisted Zengi, and retained control of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar.{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|pp=17-18}} After taking Mosul, Zengi marched north and besieged Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar; in an attack, he ferried soldiers across the river whilst others swam to the city, and eventually the city surrendered.{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|p=44}} Later, an [[Artuqids|Artuqid]] coalition of Da'ud of [[Hasankeyf|Hisn Kayfa]], [[Husam al-Din Timurtash|Timurtash]] of [[Mardin]], and Ilaldi of Amid threatened Zengi's realm in 1130 whilst he campaigned in the vicinity of [[Aleppo]] in Syria, forcing him to return and defeat them at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]].{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|p=46}} After the battle, Da'ud marched on Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar and pillaged its surroundings, thus Zengi advanced to counter him, and Da'ud withdrew to the mountains.{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|p=46}}

The ''dozdar'' (governor of the citadel) of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar, Thiqat al-Din Hasan, was reported to have sexually harassed soldiers' wives whilst their husbands were on campaign, and thus Zengi sent his ''[[hajib]]'' (chamberlain) al-Yaghsiyani to handle the situation.{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|pp=120-121}} To avoid a rebellion, al-Yaghsiyani told Hasan he was promoted to ''dozdar'' of Aleppo, so he arranged to leave the city, but was arrested, castrated, and crucified by al-Yaghsiyani upon leaving the citadel.{{sfnp|El-Azhari|2016|pp=120-121}} The Jewish scholar [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] visited the city in November 1142.{{sfnp|Gil|2004|p=471}} On Zengi's death in 1146, his eldest son [[Sayf al-Din Ghazi I]] received the emirate of Mosul, including Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar,{{sfnp|Heidemann|2002|pp=453-454}} and Izz al-Dīn Abū Bakr al-Dubaysī was appointed as the city's governor.{{sfnp|Elisséeff|1986|pp=960-961}} The city was transferred to [[Qutb al-Din Mawdud]] on his seizure of the emirate of Mosul after his elder brother Sayf al-Din's death in November 1149.{{sfnp|Heidemann|2002|pp=453-454}}

The [[Jama masjid|Grand Mosque]] of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was constructed in 1155.{{sfnp|Kana'an|2013|p=189}} After Qutb al-Din's death in September 1170, Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was inherited by his son and successor [[Sayf al-Din Ghazi II]] as emir of Mosul.{{sfnp|Heidemann|2002|pp=453-454}} [[Michael the Syrian]] recorded that a [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] monastery was confiscated and the city's bishop Basilius was imprisoned in 1173.{{sfnp|Snelders|2010}} Upon the death of Sayf al-Din Ghazi in 1180, Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was granted as an [[iqta']] to his son Mu'izz al-Din Sanjar Shah within the emirate of Mosul, however, in late 1183, Sanjar Shah recognised [[Saladin]] as his suzerain, thus becoming a vassal of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid Sultanate of Egypt]], and effectively forming an autonomous principality.{{sfnp|Heidemann|2002|pp=453-454}} Sanjar Shah continued to mint coins in his own name, and copper [[dirham]]s were minted at Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in 1203/1204.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/dynasties/late-abbasids/coins/c312|title=Zangid (Jazira) Sanjar 1203-1204|access-date=16 April 2020|publisher=[[The David Collection]]}}</ref>

Sanjar Shah ruled until his murder by his son Ghazi in 1208, and was succeeded by his son [[Mu'izz al-Din Mahmud]].{{sfnp|Kana'an|2013|pp=187-188}} Mahmud successfully maintained Zengid control over Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar with the marriage of his son Al-Malik al-Mas'ud Shahanshah to the daughter of [[Badr al-Din Lu'lu']], who had overthrown the Zengids at Mosul, and usurped power for himself in 1233.{{sfnp|Kana'an|2013|pp=187-188}} The Grand Mosque of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was renovated during Mahmud's reign.{{sfnp|Kana'an|2013|p=189}} In the early 13th century, the city's fort and madrasa are attested by Ibn al-Athir in ''Al-Tārīkh al-bāhir fī al-Dawlah al-Atābakīyah bi-al-Mawṣil'', and its mosque by Ibn Khallikan in ''Wafayāt al-Aʿyān''.{{sfnp|ul-Hasan|2005|pp=40-41}} According to the Arab scholar [[Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad]], the [[Mongol Empire]] demanded 100,000 [[dinar]]s in tribute from the ruler of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in 1251.{{sfnp|Jackson|2017|p=252}} The end of the Zengid dynasty was heralded by the death of Mahmud in 1251, as Badr al-Din Lu'lu' had Mahmud's successor Al-Malik al-Mas'ud Shahanshah killed soon after, and assumed control of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar.{{sfnp|Kana'an|2013|pp=187-188}}

===Late medieval period===
[[Image:Medresa_sor.jpg|thumb|right|The Red [[Madrasa]] of Cizre]]

[[Uzun Hasan]] usurped leadership of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] from his elder brother Jahangir in a coup at Amid in 1452, and set about expanding his realm by seizing Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in 1456, whilst the emir of Bohtan withdrew into the mountains.{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=404}} Rebellion and civil war followed the death of Uzun Hasan in 1478, and the emir of Bohtan retook Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar from the Aq Qoyunlu in 1495/1496.{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=405}}

Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar came under [[Safavid Iran|Safavid]] suzerainty in the first decade of the 16th century, but after the Ottoman victory at the [[battle of Chaldiran]] over Shah [[Ismail I]] in 1514, Sultan [[Selim I]] sent [[Idris Bitlisi]] to the city and he successfully convinced the emir of [[Bohtan]] to submit to the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfnp|Bruinessen|Boeschoten|1988|pp=14-15}} The emirate of Bohtan was incorporated into the empire as a ''hükûmet'' (autonomous territory),{{sfnp|Henning|2018|p=94}} and was assigned to the ''[[eyalet]]'' (province) of [[Diyarbekir Eyalet|Diyarbekir]] upon its formation in 1515.{{sfnp|Özoğlu|2004|p=49}} Sayyid Ahmad ruled in 1535.{{sfnp|Elisséeff|1986|pp=960-961}}

===Late modern period===
The [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833)|Egyptian invasion of Syria]] in 1831-1832 allowed Mohammed Pasha Mir Kôr, Emir of [[Soran Emirate|Soran]], to expand his realm, and he seized Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in 1833.{{sfnp|Ateş|2013|pp=67-68}}{{sfnp|Elisséeff|1986|pp=960-961}} The Ottoman response to Mir Kôr was delayed by the war with Egypt until 1836, in which year Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was retaken by an army led by [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha]].{{sfnp|Ateş|2013|pp=67-68}} Reşid deposed Saif al-Din Shir, Emir of Bohtan and ''[[mütesellim]]'' of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar, and he was replaced by [[Bedir Khan Beg]].{{sfnp|Ateş|2013|pp=67-68}} In 1838, an Ottoman army was sent to Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar during the campaign to suppress the rebellion of Abdul Agha and Khan Mahmud in the vicinity of [[Lake Van]].{{sfnp|Jwaideh|2006|p=63}}{{sfnp|Özoğlu|2001|p=397}} The German adviser [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]] accompanied the Ottoman army and reported back to the Ottoman government from Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in June 1838.{{sfnp|Özoğlu|2001|p=408}} Bedir Khan reportedly established a munitions and arms factory at the city.{{sfnp|Jwaideh|2006|pp=72-73}}

In 1842, as part of the centralisation policies of the [[Tanzimat]] reforms, the ''[[kaza]]'' (district) of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was attached to the ''eyalet'' of [[Mosul Eyalet|Mosul]], whilst the ''kaza'' of Bohtan, which constituted the remainder of the emirate, remained within the ''eyalet'' of Diyarbekir, thus administratively dividing the emirate, and provoking Bedir Khan.{{sfnp|Özoğlu|2001|p=397}} The administrative reform aimed to increase Ottoman state revenue, but left the previously loyal emir disgruntled with the Ottoman state.{{sfnp|Özoğlu|2001|p=398}} Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar was visited by the American missionary [[Asahel Grant]] on 13 June 1843.{{sfnp|Taylor|2007|p=285}} Bedir Khan's [[1843 and 1846 massacres in Hakkari]] led the British and French governments to demand his removal from power,{{sfnp|Jwaideh|2006|pp=72-73}} and he was subsequently summoned to Constantinople, but Bedir Khan refused, and an Ottoman army was sent against him.{{sfnp|Henning|2018|p=100}} The emir defeated the Ottoman army, and he declared the independence of the Emirate of Bohtan.{{sfnp|Jwaideh|2006|pp=72-73}} Bedir Khan's success was brief as a large Ottoman army led by Osman Pasha, with [[Omar Pasha]] and Sabri Pasha, marched against him, and his relative [[Yezdanşêr]] defected and allowed for the Ottoman occupation of Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar.{{sfnp|Jwaideh|2006|pp=72-73}} The Ottoman government unsuccessfully encouraged Bedir Khan to surrender, and the ''[[Wāli#Ottoman Empire term|vali]]'' (governor) of Diyarbekir wrote to the [[Naqshbandi]] [[sheikhs]] İbrahim, Salih, and Azrail at Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar to mediate in June 1847.{{sfnp|Jongerden|Verheij|2012|p=37}} Although Bedir Khan retook Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar, the emir was forced to withdraw and surrendered on 29 July.{{sfnp|Jwaideh|2006|pp=72-73}}{{sfnp|Özoğlu|2001|p=397}}

{{Main|Gazarta (Chaldean diocese)}}
At the city's foundation in the early 9th century, it was included in the [[Nisibis (East Syriac ecclesiastical province)#Diocese of Qardu|diocese of Qardu]],{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=353}} a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Nisibis in the [[Church of the East]].{{sfnp|Wilmshurst |2000|page=38}} In c. 900, the diocese of Bezabde was moved and renamed to Gazarta (Jazirat Ibn ʿUmar in Syriac), and partially assumed the territory of the diocese of Qardu,{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|p=353}} which was also moved and renamed to its new seat Tamanon, having previously been based at Penek.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|pp=40, 100}} Tamanon declined and at some point after the mention of its last bishop in 1265, its diocese was subsumed into the diocese of Gazarta.{{sfnp|Sinclair|1989|page=396}}

Eliya was archbishop of Gazarta and Amid in 1504.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=50}} Gazarta was a prominent centre of manuscript production, and most surviving east Syriac manuscripts from the late 16th century were copied there.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=241}}

The Catholic Church of Mosul, later known as the Chaldean Catholic Church, split from the Church of the East in the [[schism of 1552]], and its inaugural patriarch [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa]] appointed [[Abdisho IV Maron|Abdisho]] as archbishop of Gazarta in 1553.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=22}} [[Shemon VII Ishoyahb]], Patriarch of the Church of the East, appointed Joseph as archbishop of Gazarta in response in 1554.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=22}}{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=351}} Abdisho succeeded Sulaqa as patriarch on his death in 1555.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=22}}

Gabriel was archbishop of Gazarta in 1586.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=260}} There was an archbishop of Gazarta named John in 1594.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=86}} Joseph was archbishop of Gazarta in 1610.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=352}} A certain Joseph, archbishop of Gazarta, is mentioned in a manuscript in 1618 with the patriarch Eliya IX.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=195}} An archbishop of Gazarta named Joseph is also mentioned in a manuscript in 1657.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=195}}

Joseph, archbishop of Gazarta, resided at the village of Shah in 1822.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=136}} An archbishop named Joseph had two suffragan bishops, and served until his death in 1846.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=83}}

In 1850, the Church of the East diocese of Gazarta had 23 villages, 23 churches, 16 priests, and 220 families,{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=368}} whereas the Chaldean diocese of Gazarta had 7 villages, 6 churches, 5 priests, and 179 families.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=361}} The Chaldean Catholic Church expanded considerably in the second half of the 19th century, and consequently its diocese of Gazarta grew to 20 villages, 15 priests, and 7,000 adherents in 1867.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=361}} The Chaldean diocese decreased to 5200 adherents, with 17 churches and 14 priests, in 1896, but recovered by 1913 to 6400 adherents in 17 villages, with 11 churches and 17 priests.{{sfnp|Wilmshurst|2000|p=362}}
