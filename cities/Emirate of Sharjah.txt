The '''Emirate of Sharjah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑr|dʒ|ə}}; {{langx|ar|إِمَارَة ٱلشَّارِقَة}} ''{{transliteration|ar|Imārat Aš-Šāriqah}}'') is one of the [[emirates of the United Arab Emirates]], which covers {{convert|2,590|km2}} and has a population of over 1,400,000 (2015).<ref name="abu" /> It comprises the capital city of [[Sharjah]], after which it is named, and other minor towns and [[exclave]]s such as [[Kalba]]', [[Al Dhaid]], [[Dibba Al-Hisn]] and [[Khor Fakkan]].

The emirate is an [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sheikhdrsultan.ae/portal/en/home.aspx |title=The Official Website of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi|access-date=21 June 2015 |archive-date=8 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108140637/http://www.sheikhdrsultan.ae/portal/en/home.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> It has been ruled by [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi]] since 1972, except for a seven-day period during [[1987 Sharjawi coup d'état attempt|an attempted coup d'etat]] by his brother, Sheikh `Abd al-`Aziz bin Muhammad Al Qasimi.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-06-19-8702150353-story.html| title = EMIRATES ACT TO END COUP CRISIS – Chicago Tribune| website = [[Chicago Tribune]]| access-date = 16 March 2021| archive-date = 27 April 2019| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190427013000/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-06-19-8702150353-story.html| url-status = live}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Sharjah, UAE.jpg|thumb|right|Older residential area of Sharjah, displaying the local architecture]]
Human settlement in the area covered by the emirate has existed for over 120,000 years, with significant finds made of early axes and stone tools as well as Copper and [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Age]] implements in [[Dhaid|Al Dhaid]], [[Al Thuqeibah]], [[Mleiha|Mileiha]], [[Tell Abraq]], [[Muweilah|Muwailah]], [[Al Madam]] and [[Jebel Faya]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Another ancient Sharjah site found by archaeologists {{!}} The National|date = 31 March 2015|url = http://www.thenational.ae/uae/heritage/another-ancient-sharjah-site-found-by-archaeologists|access-date = 2015-04-01|archive-date = 30 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151130023216/http://www.thenational.ae/uae/heritage/another-ancient-sharjah-site-found-by-archaeologists|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>Madhloom T., "Excavations of the Iraqi Mission at Mleha', Shaijah, UAE.", Sumer, vol. 30, no. 1-2, pp. 149–158, 1975</ref> Archaeological finds in the Mleiha area point to human habitation consistent with the spread of humanity from Africa to the wider world, evidenced by finds displayed at the [[Mleiha Archaeological Centre]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=You are being redirected...|url=https://www.discovermleiha.ae/archaeological-sites/|access-date=2021-08-31|website=www.discovermleiha.ae|archive-date=31 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831235747/https://www.discovermleiha.ae/archaeological-sites/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically the emirate was one of the wealthiest towns in the region.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia|last = Lorimer|first = John|publisher = Government of India|year = 1908|location = Bombay|pages = 1451}}</ref>

Around 1727, the [[Al Qasimi]] clan took control of Sharjah and declared the polity independent.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ayub |first=Mohamed Shaaban |date=2022-06-10 |title=How Wahhabism Led the Fight Against the British in the Gulf |url=https://newlinesmag.com/essays/how-wahhabism-led-the-fight-against-the-british-in-the-gulf/ |access-date=2023-02-28 |website=New Lines Magazine |language=en}}</ref>

The first in a long series of maritime skirmishes between the [[Al Qasimi]] and British vessels took place in 1797, when the British-flagged [[Snow (ship)|snow]] the ''Bassein'' was seized and released two days later. The cruiser ''Viper ''was subsequently attacked off [[Bushehr|Bushire]]. The Al Qasimi leader, [[Saqr bin Rashid Al Qasimi]], protested innocence in both cases.

A period of great instability followed along the coast, with a number of actions between British and [[Al Qasimi]] vessels alongside various changes of leadership and allegiances between the Rulers of [[Ras al-Khaimah|Ras Al Khaimah]], [[Ajman]] and Sharjah with [[Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi]] claiming sovereignty over 'all the Joasmee ports' in 1823, a claim recognised by the British at the time.

On 8 January 1820, [[Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi]] signed [[the General Maritime Treaty with Britain]], accepting protectorate status in order to resist [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] domination. Following the expiration of a further, ten year, treaty in 1843, on 4 May 1853 Sharjah, along with other Sheikhdoms on what was then known as the 'Arabian Coast' signed the Perpetual Treaty of Peace, which gave rise to the collective name [[Trucial States]] being given to the emirates of the coast.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Islands and Maritime Boundaries of the Gulf 1798–1960 Vol 1|last = Schofield|first = R|publisher = Archive Editions|year = 1990|isbn=978-1-85207-275-9|location = UK|pages = 139}}</ref>

Like four of its neighbours, [[Ajman]], [[Dubai]], [[Ras Al Khaimah]], and [[Umm Al Quwain]], its position along trade routes to [[India]] made it important enough to be recognised as a [[salute state]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davidson |first=Christopher |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E88dDAAAQBAJ&dq=Sharjah+salute+state&pg=PA21 |title=After the Sheikhs: The Coming Collapse of the Gulf Monarchies |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-024450-7 |pages=21 |language=en}}</ref>

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sharjah was an important pearl fishing port. A British marine survey of 1830 found 'three to four hundred boats' fishing in the season, earning the ruler 100,000 [[Maria Theresa thaler|Maria Theresa Dollars]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Islands and Maritime Boundaries of the Gulf 1798–1960|last = Schofield|first = R|publisher = Archive Editions|year = 1990|isbn=978-1-85207-275-9|location = UK|pages = 544}}</ref>

In 1932, [[Imperial Airways]] established a regular air service through Sharjah, which was an overnight stop on the Eastern British Empire route. The [[Mahatta Fort]] was built to house the airline's guests.

On 2 December 1971, [[Sheikh]] [[Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi]] joined Sharjah to the United Arab Emirates.<ref name="nyt" /> On 24 January 1972 however, the former ruler Sheikh [[Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi]] staged a leftist coup. Having previously deposed Saqr in 1965, Sheikh Khalid had ordered the demolition of [[Sharjah Fort (Al Hisn Sharjah)|Sharjah Fort]] (Al Hisn Sharjah) to expunge Saqr's memory. Saqr took over Khalid's palace, holding him inside and in the ensuing confusion Sheikh Khalid was killed. Saqr was arrested and Khalid's brother, [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi]], an author and historian, came to power.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jessup |first=John E. |title=An encyclopedic dictionary of conflict and conflict resolution, 1945–1996 |page=773 |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-313-28112-9 }}</ref>

In 1987, Sultan's brother Abdulaziz [[1987 Sharjawi coup d'état attempt|staged a coup]] while Sultan was abroad. Huge state debt was stated as the reason. Then-[[President of the United Arab Emirates|UAE President]] [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Zayed]] denounced the coup, and a deal was reached for Sultan to be restored, while Abdulaziz would become the deputy ruler. Sultan, however, dismissed Abdulaziz quite quickly.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Ismael |first1=Tareq Y. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_EiCikYT2sC&dq=%22Sharjah%22+Sultan+Abdulaziz+%221987%22&pg=PA429 |title=Government and Politics of the Contemporary Middle East: Continuity and Change |last2=Ismael |first2=Jacqueline S. |date=2012-10-02 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-94139-9 |pages=429 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Nuttall |first=Keith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdJEAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Sharjah%22+Sultan+Abdulaziz+%221987%22&pg=PA91 |title=Shipping and Development in Dubai: Infrastructure, Innovation and Institutions in the Gulf |date=2021-10-21 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-7556-4164-2 |pages=91 |language=en}}</ref> In 1999, the Crown Prince (Sultan's eldest son) died of a drug overdose while on vacation in their palace in England.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rugh |first=A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GaJDAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Sharjah%22+Sultan+Crown+Prince+died+%221999%22&pg=PA156 |title=The Political Culture of Leadership in the United Arab Emirates |date=2007-03-05 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-60349-3 |pages=156 |language=en}}</ref> Sultan made the decision to testify in front of a UK court{{why?|date=December 2021}}.{{Citation needed|date = November 2014}} The new Crown Prince, Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed bin Sultan Al Qasimi, was appointed from a remote branch of the family.

Sharjah is the third largest emirate in the United Arab Emirates, and is the only one to have land on both the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Oman]]. The emirate covers {{convert|2,590|km2}} which is equivalent to 3.3 per cent of the UAE's total area, excluding the islands. It has a population of over 1,800,000 (2022).<ref name="abu" /> The city lies {{convert|170|km|mile|abbr=on}} away from the UAE capital city [[Abu Dhabi]].

The emirate of Sharjah comprises the city of [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] (the seat of the emirate), and other minor towns and [[enclave]]s. The [[city]] of Sharjah, which overlooks the [[Persian Gulf]], has a population of 1,600,000 (2022 census). Sharjah City borders Dubai to the south and Ajman to the north, and the three form a [[Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area|conurbation]].<ref name="GulfNews2012">{{cite news |last=Al-Qassemi |first=Sultan Sooud |url=http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/infinite-possibilities-for-dubai-sharjah-ajman-conurbation-1.1037372 |title=Infinite possibilities for Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman conurbation |date=19 June 2012 |publisher=[[Gulf News]] |access-date=21 March 2019 |archive-date=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222002857/http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/infinite-possibilities-for-dubai-sharjah-ajman-conurbation-1.1037372 |url-status=live }}</ref> Sharjah also owns three enclaves on the east coast, bordering the [[Gulf of Oman]]. These are [[Kalba]], [[Dibba Al-Hisn]], and [[Khor Fakkan]], which provide Sharjah with a major east coast port. In the Persian Gulf, the island of [[Sir Abu Nu’ayr]] belongs to Sharjah,<ref name="abu" /> and [[Abu Musa]] is claimed by UAE, but controlled by [[Iran]]. Sharjah has an [[exclave]] containing the village of [[Nahwa]], located inside the [[Omani]] [[enclave]] of [[Madha]] which borders [[Fujairah]] and Sharjah. The emirate also encompasses some important oasis areas, the most famous of which is the fertile Dhaid region, where a range of vegetables and fruits are cultivated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sheikh Sultan inaugurates greenhouses project in Al Dhaid |url=https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2022/03/11/sheikh-sultan-inaugurates-greenhouses-project-in-al-dhaid |access-date=2023-03-06 |website=www.gulftoday.ae}}</ref>

==Government==
{{See also|Government of Sharjah}}
The Emirate of Sharjah is led by the ruler of Sharjah. It has been led by Sheikh [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi]] since 1972.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Federal Supreme Council |url=https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/federal-supreme-council/his-highness-sheikh-sultan-bin-mohammed-al-qasimi |access-date=2023-05-26 |website=uaecabinet.ae}}</ref> The ruler of Sharjah appoints members of the Sharjah Executive Council and the Sharjah Consultative Council to manage the day-to-day affairs of the emirate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sharjah - The Official Portal of the UAE Government |url=https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-seven-emirates/sharjah |access-date=2023-05-26 |website=u.ae |language=en}}</ref> Sharjah has devolved some authority of local decisions to Emiri Diwans (Ruler's Courts) in areas such [[Kalba]] and [[Khor Fakkan]].

===Commerce and Tourism Development Authority===
[[File:Sharjah eyes1.jpg|thumb|The Emirates Eye, the [[ferris wheel]] at Al-Qasbah in Sharjah City]]
The Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority (SCDTA) was established by decree in 1996 to "promote commercial and tourism activities" in the emirate. The state-backed authority is responsible for, among other things, creating policies for local and international exhibitions and marketing Sharjah to attract foreign investment and tourists.
<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sharjah Tourism and Commerce Development Authority - SCTDA |url=https://www.sharjahtourism.ae/ |access-date=2023-03-06 |website=Sharjah Commerce & Tourism Development Authority |language=en-US}}</ref>
One such initiative, is the annual [[Sharjah Light Festival]], which showcases the emirate's landmarks through vibrant light shows and attracts thousands of visitors each year.
<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sharjah illuminates 12 iconic art and culture landmarks across the emirate in the 13th Sharjah Light Festival|url=https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/events-and-conferences/sharjah-illuminates-12-iconic-art-and-culture-landmarks-across-the-emirate-in-the-13th-sharjah-light-festival-nruol0dd |access-date=2024-09-30 |website=ZAWYA by LSEG |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Investment and Development Authority===
The [[Sharjah Investment and Development Authority]] (Shurooq) was established in 2009 as an independent government body to "oversee the social, cultural, environmental and economic development of Sharjah in line with its [[Islam]]ic identity." It focuses on three areas for the emirate; investment, development, and asset and property management. Shurooq's developments include:
* [[Al Qasba Sharjah|Al Qasba]] – 10,000-acre project including a {{convert|1|km|mile|abbr=on}}-long man-made [[canal]] and {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation wheel, it was made open for the public in 2005. It includes Masrah Al Qasba, a theatre, the Maraya Art Centre, the Multaqa Al Qasba meetings and conference centre and a children's Fun Zone. The project, managed by the Al Qasba Development Authority (an affiliate of Shurooq) has an architectural design including pedestrian bridges, boats, and lagoons. It attracted two million visitors in 2011.
* Al Majaz Waterfront – Shurooq opened the Al Majaz Waterfront in December 2011 after redeveloping it. The new park, located between Jamal Abdul Nasser Street and Khalid Lagoon Corniche, covers an area of {{convert|3|km2}} for recreation, including six new buildings with restaurants and a {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall water fountain.
* [[Heart of Sharjah]] – The Heart of Sharjah, slated for completion in January 2015, has been proposed by Shurooq as a tourist and trade destination with commercial, cultural, and residential projects as well as hotel, archaeological sites, museums, and commercial space.
* The Chedi Khorfakkan Resort – The Chedi Khorfakkan, scheduled to open in 2015, is under construction an hour outside of Sharjah city centre. Shurooq has stated that once complete, the project will include a tourist resort and a fort on the Al Suwifa Mountain.

===Decency laws===
Conservative Sharjah is the only Emirate in the UAE in which the sale of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is prohibited, although its consumption in one's own home is permissible if one is in possession of a valid Alcohol Licence (as is the transportation of alcohol between the place of sale and the home). The only place this prohibition is relaxed is the members-only sporting club, the [[Sharjah Wanderers]].

Sharjah also maintains the strictest decency laws in the UAE, introduced in 2001, with a conservative dress code required for both men and women. Mixing between unmarried men and women is illegal: "A man and a woman who are not in a legally acceptable relationship should not be alone in public places, or in suspicious times or circumstances," according to a booklet published by the municipality in 2001.<ref name="six" />

{{main|Postage stamps and postal history of Sharjah}}

In 1963, Britain ceded responsibility for the Trucial States' postal systems. An American philatelic entrepreneur by the name of [[Finbar Kenny]] saw the opportunity to create a number of editions of stamps aimed at the lucrative collector's market and in 1964 concluded a deal with a number of Trucial States to take the franchise for the production of stamps for their respective governments. Kenny had made something of a speciality out of signing these deals, also signing with the Rulers of Ajman and Fujairah in 1964—and getting involved in a bribery case in the USA over his dealings with the government of the Cook Islands. The issue of stamps from [[Manama, Ajman|Ajman's dependency of Manama]]—a tiny agrarian village in the remote plains at which a 'post office' was opened—is a perfect example.

These stamps, luridly illustrated and irrelevant to the actual emirates they purported to come from (editions included 'Space Research' and 'Tokyo Olympic Games') became known as 'dunes'. Their proliferation quickly devalued them.<ref>{{Cite book |last=R |first=Lavanya |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6KSEAAAQBAJ&dq=%22stamps%22+from+Ajman's+dependency+of+Manama&pg=PA23 |title=Life of Martin Luther King, Jr. through Philately: MLK Stamp Catalogue |edition=1st |date=2022-07-04 |publisher=Catabooks |isbn=978-93-5493-439-1 |page=23 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Carlton |first=R.

===Cricket===
The [[Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium]] has hosted almost 200 [[cricket]] [[One Day International]]s, more than any other ground in [[UAE]], and 4 [[Test cricket|Test matches]]. Since 2003, the increasingly crowded cricket calendar has precluded the holding of any major international matches at Sharjah although the stadium has been the venue for certain other matches, such as the [[2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup]]. The use of the venue has declined as the new 20,000-seat [[Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium]] in Abu Dhabi has become the preferred venue for cricket in the UAE.

===Football===
[[Soccer|Football]] teams in Sharjah emirate:
# [[Sharjah FC]]

Since 2016 the event is also combined with [[Aquabike World Championship (powerboating)]] making the Grand Prix of Sharjah the final of the two main disciplines in Powerboating World

Net profit for 2011 was AED274m (US$74.6m), down 13 per cent on the previous year. The airline, which also has hubs in [[Egypt]] ([[Borg El Arab Airport]], [[Alexandria]]) and [[Morocco]] ([[Mohammed V International Airport]], [[Casablanca]]), delayed plans to establish a fourth hub in [[Jordan]] in 2012.
