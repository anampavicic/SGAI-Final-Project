==History==
[[File:Painting of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq.jpg|thumb|Painting of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq. Kept in the collection of the [[Raza Library|Raza Library Rampur]].]]
The city of Firozpur was founded by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]], a ruler of the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughluq dynasty]], who reigned over the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate of Delhi]] from 1351 to 1388.<ref name="sen2">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |page=98}}</ref> It is located on the banks of the Sutlej River on the India–Pakistan border. The nearby [[Firozpur Cantonment]] is a major [[cantonment]] of the country.
[[File:Battle of Ferozeshah - charge of the Bengal Light Cavalry, The Pictorial Times, 1846.jpg|thumb|Battle of Ferozeshah - charge of the Bengal Light Cavalry, The Pictorial Times, 1846]]
British rule was first established in 1835, when, on the failure of heirs to the [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] family who possessed it, a small [[escheat]] to the British government was formed, and the district was gradually formed around this nucleus. The strategic importance of Ferozepur (as it was spelled under the British) was at this time very great, and in 1839 it was the outpost of [[British India]] in the direction of the Sikh power. It accordingly became the scene of operations during the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], in which the Sikhs crossed the [[Sutlej]] in December 1845, but were defeated and withdrew into their own territory, and peace was concluded with the [[Treaty of Lahore]]. Later, throughout the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]] Ferozepur remained in the hands of the English.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ferozepur|volume=10|page=281}}</ref>
