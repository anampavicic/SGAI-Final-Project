'''Carmona''' ({{IPA|tl|kaɾˈmɔna|}}), officially the '''City of Carmona''' ({{lang-tl|Lungsod ng Carmona}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines|component city]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 106,256 people.{{PH census|current}}

Carmona is also the newest city in the Philippines; it became a city on July 8, 2023, and it was the 149th city founded in the Philippine archipelago.

==Etymology==
By virtue of a decree issued on February 20, 1857, by Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] through Governor General [[Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero]], Latag became a separate municipality with the name it bears today: [[Carmona, Spain|Carmona]], named after the [[Carmona, Spain|city of the same name]] in the province of [[Province of Seville|Seville, Spain]].

==History==
===Early history===
Carmona was formerly a settlement called Latag, which was annexed to the town of [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]] upon the latter's creation in 1595. The origins of its name are unknown. In 1856, the settlement's inhabitants demanded the conversion of Latag into a town, spearheaded by Tiburcio Purificacion.

Carmona history started with three brothers who came to the land of Carmona, which was at the time called Labac.

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1595, Silang became a town. The former Sitio Labac became Barrio Latag. Carmona during that time was just a part of Silang. This is not surprising because in the early part of the Spanish regime, Silang included what are known today as the municipalities of [[Indang]], San Francisco de Malabon (now [[General Trias]]), and [[Maragondon]]. Moreover, [[Alfonso, Cavite|Alfonso]], Amadeo, and Mendez were mere sitios of Indang; Santa Cruz de Malabon (now Tanza) was a part of San Francisco de Malabon or Malabon Grande; and Magallanes and Ternate were [[barrio]]s of Maragondon. Furthermore, Maragondon itself had been a part of the Corregimiento of Mariveles on the opposite side of [[Manila Bay]].

On March 9, 1746, a decree determined the boundaries of Silang and Biñan signed by Mayor Pedro Calderon Enriquez.

On November 15, 1759, two years after securing the independence of Carmona, the [[Principalía|principales]] requested the Governor of Cavite for the reversal of the Canon on communal lands after constructing their own public buildings and irrigation works.

In 1838, the movement of the inhabitants of Latag to become a town started.

On February 20, 1857, due to the great distance to the mother town, the principales and incumbent [[Cabeza de Barangay]] of Latag petitioned for its separation and conversion into a municipality. The new town was called Carmona, after a town of the same name in the Spanish province of Seville.

On April 16, 1857, boundaries between Silang and Carmona were set.

On September 15, 1859, the inhabitants of Carmona returned to managing and ownership of communal lands.

On January 22, 1864, the incumbent gobernadorcillo and principales of Carmona petitioned higher authorities for the abolition of the [[repartimiento]] of the communal lands triennially.

In 1872, the communal lands were sold at public auction, which was opposed two years later by Don Gaspar Espiritu in a communication to the Superior Civil Governor.

On October 25, 1874, an event of great significance to the people of Carmona was a strong typhoon, which wrought considerable damage to the public works and private property.

On July 6, 1881, seven years later, the principales of Carmona requested the rectification of the town's boundaries.

During the [[Philippine Revolution]] in 1896, the [[gobernadorcillo]] of Carmona was Kapitan Damian Ermitano after the administrations of Tiburcio Purificacion, Mariano Mapanoo and Donald C. Virtucio, Augusto Manaog and Fabian Tenedero.

===American occupation era===
After the revolution and the occupation of the country by the Americans in 1901, the first local executive of Carmona was Martin Reyes, who was followed next by Marcelo Reyes, Prudencio Torres, Juan Alumia, Estanislao Paular, Marciano Mapanoo, and Juan Zamora.

In 1941, the inhabitants of Carmona renewed the demand for "homestead" land.

===Philippine independence===
The mayors who assumed office after [[World War II]] were Bernardo Hebron, Eulalio Reyes and Cesar Casal and Felino L. Maquinay.

In 1959, the district of San Gabriel and San Jose of Barangay Kabilang Baybay were purchased by the National Government for the relocation of squatters from [[Metro Manila]].

On March 14, 1981, the relocation site, which teemed with people from almost every part of the country and was more popularly known as the resettlement area, became an independent municipality called [[General Mariano Alvarez]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=BP|number=75| url = https://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg75.html | title = An Act Creating the Municipality of General Mariano Alvarez in the Province of Cavite|date=June 13, 1980| accessdate = February 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=PP|number=2033| url = https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1980/11/11/proclamation-no-2033-s-1980/ | title =  Setting the date for the holding of a plebiscite to decide the creation of the municipality of General Mariano Alvarez, province of Cavite | date = November 11, 1980 | accessdate = February 8, 2022}}</ref>

According to research conducted in 1982, by Sangguniang Bayan members Ernesto Zamora, Salvador P. Manahan, Pio Purificacion, Narciso Levardo, and Romy Laurito, assisted by Municipal Secretary Rogelio D. Paular, it was found out that the history of Carmona began during the 15th century. As related by a reliable informant, three brothers coming from the mountain of [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]] were said to be the first settlers in the place which was then called  "Latag", a Tagalog word for "plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. The settlement was not known to other residents of Silang until some of them also went down to the place, cleared some forest areas and established their residence.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On June 30, 2022, House Bill No. 108 was filed by [[Cavite's 5th congressional district]] representative and former Carmona mayor Roy Loyola for the conversion of the municipality of Carmona into a component city. It was substituted with House Bill No. 3968 filed on August 24, 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 23, 2022 |title=AN ACT CONVERTING THE MUNICIPALITY OF CARMONA IN THE PROVINCE OF CAVITE INTO A COMPONENT CITY TO BE KNOWN AS THE CITY OF CARMONA |url=https://hrep-website.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/legisdocs/first_19/CR00009.pdf |access-date=September 5, 2022 |website=House of Representatives}}</ref>

===Population density===
The highest densities are found in the Poblacion area (Barangays 1–8) and Barangays Milagrosa and Maduya, where land areas are significantly lower than the other barangays. Barangay Lantic posted development of the Kuok Property within the Lantic area; it is expected that the density will increase within the ten-year period.<ref name=demog/>

===Population distribution===

Carmona's population is concentrated in Barangays 1–8 at the Poblacion area. Barangay Lantic is the most populated barangay, which posted a total population of 24,721. Dense population is also found in Barangay 9, the central business district of the municipality. Most population catalysts such as banks, town center, and commercial establishments are found in the Poblacion area.<ref name=demog/>

The main language spoken is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. In some areas they speak [[Chabacano]] or Chavacano, sometimes referred to by linguists as Philippine Creole Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language spoken in the Philippines. [[English language|English]] is considered as the second language and is widely used as medium of communication in business and higher education. Other [[Philippine languages]] spoken are Waray, Bicolano, Cebuano, Ilokano, Pangasinense, and Hiligaynon. Chinese and Spanish are also spoken by some local residents.

===Religion===

==Economy==
{{PH poverty incidence}}
Cottage industries include metal works, metalcraft, footwear industries, concrete products, tricycle assembly, rattan handicrafts, and bakeries. Manufacturing firms engaged in handicraft (bags and shoes), furniture making, business retailing, personal and business services, and food-based enterprises contribute to the municipality's trade and commerce. Mercantile activities in the municipality are concentrated in the Poblacion area and along Governor's Drive. Carmona has been classified as a first-class municipality since July 1996, brought about by industrialization, real estate development, and commercial activities.

Carmona's progress accelerated after the conversion of more than {{convert|50|ha}} of farmlands into industrial areas in 1998. Garment industries, steel fabrication, microchips and semi-conductors, tool fabrication, bus assembly, bulb factories, die casting, and other small and medium-scale industries currently operate in the municipality. These investments continue to provide local employment, generate export earnings, increase municipal revenues, and serve as vehicles for technology transfer. Foreign investments are pouring in as export-oriented industries continue to flourish.

Employment rate: Out of a potential labor force of 24,918 (members 15 years old and older who are actively seeking work), 98.03% are employed, while 1.97% are unemployed. The presence of 8 industrial estates and 2 industrial compounds contributes largely to the high employment rate of the municipality.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Carmona River Dam.JPG|thumb|An [[irrigation]] dam in Carmona.]]
[[File:CarmonaField.jpg|thumb|A [[rice]] field in Carmona.]]
The economy of Carmona is generally agricultural. Almost half of its total land area is devoted to agriculture.

In 2000, the total land area devoted to agriculture was {{convert|609|ha}} or {{Percentage|609|3092|2}} of the total land area of Carmona. {{convert|230|ha}} are irrigated areas all of which are currently planted with rice and vegetables, {{convert|30|ha}} are upland rice areas, {{convert|122.5|ha}} are for diversified trees and crops, and the {{convert|211.5|ha}} are considered pasture land.

There are 217 farmers in the Municipality engaged in planting and farming. Crops and livestock farmers are distributed among 14 barangays of Carmona.

However, with the implementation of the CALABARZON growth area, the municipality of Carmona has slowly become an industrial enclave in the province. The advent of industrialization has threatened the agricultural base of Carmona. As of April 1999, land used for rice production has gone down; sugarcane plantation has decreased considerably and those land uses for other crops and vegetables totaled {{convert|84.5|ha}} during the same year.

At present, the programs and services of the Department of Agriculture (DA) are focused on five priority programs: a sustained self-sufficiency program for rice and corn, strengthening of production market linkage, an acceleration of livelihood program, aggressive assistance to organizational development of farmers, and assistance to agriculture-related priority programs of other government agencies.

;Crop production: The major crops produced in the municipality are lowland and upland rice and sugarcane. Other crops grown are corn, vegetables, root crops, and fruit trees.

;Fruits and vegetables production: In 2000, an area covering some {{convert|23.5|ha}} was planted with various crops and fruit trees. These yielded an estimated {{convert|444|m|sp=us}} of assorted products.

;Livestock and poultry production: Livestock and poultry raising in the municipality are largely backyard family enterprises. Animals raised are generally for home consumption and an additional income source for the family. Total production of livestock and poultry in 1999 registered a head count of 7,907. Pigs raised both for human consumption or for breeding purposes are estimated at 1,675, while the equally popular poultry raising produced about 4,472 head. An estimated 1,013 head of cattle, 31 head of carabaos and 716 goats were also produced. Based on reports of the municipal Agricultural Officer, the total livestock and poultry production in the municipality is still below the sufficiency level for beef, pork meat and eggs.<ref>[http://www.carmona.com.ph/eco_agriculture.htm Local Economy | Carmona Cavite, Philippines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Industry===
[[File:6043Carmona, Cavite Roads Buildings Landmarks 20.jpg|thumb|People's Technology Complex]]
Industrialization accounts for the rapid growth of Carmona's business community from an otherwise quaint agricultural town in the 1950s into the growing city of today. Brought about by huge capital from the national government, the industrial complexes bolstered the increase of the city's revenues and the change in the people's lifestyle.

There are eight existing industrial complexes located in the city limits. Its proximity to Manila and at the same time being the gateway to the [[Calabarzon]] area made Carmona a promising venue for business.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://carmonagov.net/home/for-businesses/business-profile.html |title=Carmona Business Profile<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=November 9, 2010 |archive-date=February 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225042251/http://carmonagov.net/home/for-businesses/business-profile.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On the other hand, the local government has been very supportive of the investors. There are 114 factories in eight industrial parks/complexes to date. At present there are the eight industrial complexes strewn along the [[Governor's Drive]], in a total of {{convert|419.31|ha}}, making up {{Percentage|419.31|3092|2}} of the town's land area. Ranging from {{convert|9|to|100|ha}}, these industrial estates are complete with amenities, secured, and in close coordination with the municipal government through the Carmona Business Club and other agencies.

===Commercial and financial===
[[File:5523Carmona, Cavite Roads Landmarks Attractions 36.jpg|thumb|Carmona Public Market]]
One of the biggest commercial subdivisions in town is the Macaria Business Park in Barangay Mabuhay which houses a [[WalterMart]] branch in its {{convert|13.13|ha|adj=on}} lot. Recently, fast food chains and restaurants have been opened to compete for regular patronage at the Paseo de Carmona in Barangay Maduya.

Moreover, numerous traders and retailers are housed in the bustling Carmona Public Market.

The bulk of commercial activities come from wholesale/retail enterprises, which comprise a total of 619 establishments. There are also service-related establishments: businesses, food shops and amusement operators, with 35 banks and other lending institutions.  Among the major banking institutions that cater to the financial needs of businesses in Carmona and neighboring towns are [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI), [[Metrobank (Philippines)|Metrobank]], [[Banco de Oro]] (BDO), Chinatrust Bank, [[Chinabank]], [[Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation]] (RCBC), and [[Unionbank (Philippines)|Unionbank]]. {{clear-left}}

==Healthcare==
[[File:6043Carmona, Cavite Roads Buildings Landmarks 06.jpg|thumb|Carmona Hospital & Medical Center]]
The Pagamutang Panglungsod ng Carmona ({{literal translation|Carmona City Hospital}} and the Rural Health Unit (RHU) are government-owned and run healthcare facilities in the town.

The main health center in the city is located in Barangay 4. A total of eleven barangay health centers, or substations, of the RHU are established in different barangays.

In addition to the rural health units and the Pagamutang Panglungsod, there are also private clinics and hospitals operating in the city.

==Education==

[[File:CarmonaNationalHighSchool.jpg|thumb|Interior of Carmona National High School, a [[rainbow]] can be seen in the sky]]
The education sector in Carmona has improved in many aspects of endeavor. In line with the local government's thrust of enhancing quality education, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] (DepEd), particularly the District of Carmona and Carmona National High School, with the full support of the local government unit, implemented various programs and projects that intensified the education sector's efforts to achieve its goals.

As early as 1995, various programs for the improvement of quality education started with a vision of producing competitive students at both the elementary and secondary levels. Carmona posted a literacy rate of 89%. The local government started with the computerization of all schools. Each public school was given computer units, and students were provided with computer lessons. This is in consonance with the belief that modern technology and equipment are considered factors in enhancing better education. To address the increasing number of enrollees and students, the LGU conceptualized the construction of 2-story buildings in different schools in Carmona.

At present, the municipality has a substantial number of classrooms and teachers to meet the learning needs of the school-age population. As of the school year 2005–2006, the municipality has 50 educational institutions, 28 of which are public schools and 17 are privately run. The public schools are categorized into 18 pre-schools, 9 elementary schools, 1 junior high school, 1 senior high school, and 1 tertiary school. The private educational institutions are composed of 10 pre-schools, 7 elementary schools, 3 secondary/high schools, and a computer college.<ref>[http://carmonagov.net/home/for-residents/education.html Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
