'''Uzhhorod''' ({{langx|uk|Ужгород}}, {{IPA|uk|ˈuʒɦorod|IPA}}, {{Langx|hu|Ungvár}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈuŋɡvaːr|IPA}}, {{Langx|sk|Užhorod}}) is a [[List of cities in Ukraine|city]] and [[List of hromadas of Ukraine|municipality]] on the [[Uzh|Uzh River]] in western [[Ukraine]], at the border with [[Slovakia]] and near the border with [[Hungary]]. The city is approximately equidistant from [[the Baltic]], [[Adriatic Sea|the Adriatic]] and [[the Black Sea]] (650–690&nbsp;km) making it the most inland city in this part of [[Europe]]. It is the [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] ([[oblast|region]]), as well as the administrative center of [[Uzhhorod Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) within the oblast. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2022|115449|.}}

==Name==
The city's earliest known name is ''Ungvár'', from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''Ung'' ([[Uzh|River Uzh]]) and ''vár'' "castle, fortress", originally referring to a castle outside the city (probably [[Nevytske Castle]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Németh |first1=Péter |date=2007 |title=Álom és valóság: Ung vára |url=http://castrumbene.hu/files/c6_01nemeth.pdf |journal=Castrum |volume=6 |pages=5–10 |issn=1787-1093}}</ref>).<ref name="sebestyen">{{cite book |last=Sebestyén |first=Zsolt |date=2020 |title=Kárpátalja helységnevei |trans-title=The Placenames of Transcarpathia |url=https://mek.oszk.hu/20800/20807/20807.pdf |language=hu |location=Nyíregyháza |isbn=978-973-0-31294-2 |pages=457–459 |chapter=Ungvár, Ужгород}}</ref><ref name="halas">{{cite journal |last1=Галас |first1=Кирило |date=2002 |title="Словник українських топонімів Закарпаття" (фрагменти) |journal=Сучасні проблеми мовознавства та літературознавства |volume=6 |pages=365–376}}</ref>

The name ''Uzhhorod'' was coined in early 19th century [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] circles as a literal translation of the name ''Ungvár''.<ref name="sebestyen" /><ref name="halas" /> The city officially adopted this name some time after 1920, under [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak]] administration.

===Early history===

==== White-Croat Ungvar (677) ====
[[File:Ужгородський замок (6).jpg|thumb|[[Uzhhorod Castle]]]]
The city was founded by [[early Slavs]], one tribe of whom was the [[White Croats]], who settled the area of the modern Uzhhorod under [[Kuber]] in the second half of the first millennium AD.<ref name=":0" />Warriors from Ukraine established the Ungvar fortress in 677 according to the [[Chronicon Pictum]]. The settlement was the center of a new Slavic principality headed by a dynasty descended from [[Porga of Croatia|Porga]]'s nephew [[Kubrat]]. In the 9th century, the fortified castle changed into a fortified early [[Feudalism|feudal]] town-settlement which according to [[Gesta Hungarorum]] was originally subject to the [[Old Bulgarian]] Prince [[Salan]] until falling to [[Laborec (ruler)|Laborec]], a ruler who was loyal to [[Great Moravia]].<ref name=":0" />

==== Magyar conquest (895) ====
[[Almos]]'s [[Magyars]] who had arrived in the region from Kyiv stormed the Hunguar fortress in 895 AD. Having taken over the castle, Almos appointed his son [[Árpád]] as prince of Hunguaria and from Ungvar his warriors were called Hungarians.<ref>Deeds of the Hungarians by Anonymous, Chapter 13</ref> As this may be viewed as naive folk etymology by a medieval writer, for further information on the ethnonym of the Hungarians see the article [[Name of Hungary]].{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

In the Kingdom of Hungary, the small town began to extend its borders. [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Saint Stephen]] made it the centre (castrum) of [[Ung County|Ung county]] with a strong military presence to protect the north east border of Hungary. In 1241–1242 the [[Mongols]] of [[Batu Khan]] burnt the settlement. After, in 1248 the city was granted town privileges by the [[Béla IV of Hungary|King Béla IV of Hungary]]. In the early 14th century, Uzhhorod was involved in the civil wars in the interregnum between Hungarian barons when the dynasty of Árpád died out. Finally [[Charles I of Hungary]] from the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Anjou dynasty]], descendant of the [[Árpád dynasty|House of Árpád]] by his mother occupied the throne. The Anjou House also ruled the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the Hungarian king Charles I invited the [[Drugeth]]s (Italian counts from the [[Kingdom of Naples]]) into Hungary and gave the town to them. The Drugeth family became a member of the [[Hungarian nobility]]. During that period [[Philip Drugeth]] built [[Uzhhorod Castle]]. Together with the castle, the city began to grow. From 1430, Uzhhorod became a free royal town.

===Under Habsburg rule===
During the 16–17th centuries The Kingdom of Hungary fell into three parts. The middle was occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]], the north west was ruled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]], the eastern part became the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], that hold the independent Hungarian statehood. During this period there were many handicraft corporations in Uzhhorod. In this period the city was engaged in the religious and political fight between primarily Hungarian [[Protestant]] [[Transylvania]] and the German [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Austria]]. Each one wanted to reunite the Kingdom of Hungary under their rule. In 1646 the [[Union of Uzhhorod|Union of Ungvár]] was proclaimed and the [[Greek-Catholic]] church was established, in a ceremony held in the Ungvár castle by the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Aegis. In 1707 Ungvár was the residence of [[Ferenc II Rákóczi]], leader of the national liberation war of Hungarians against Habsburgs. From 1780 the city became the capital of the [[Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo|Greek Catholic Eparchy]] and from 1776 the center of a newly created school district.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A 1777 évi Ratio educationis|year=1913}}</ref>

The beginning of the 19th century was characterized by economic changes, including the first factories in the city. The greatest influence on Ungvár among the political events of the 19th century was made by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]-1849, during which the native Hungarian nobility sought both to shake off the suzerainty of the [[Austrian Empire]] and to have authority over their own people. 27 March 1848 was officially celebrated in the city as the overthrow of the monarchy in Hungary. It is now celebrated in Hungary on 15 March.

In 1872 the first railway line opened, linking the city to the important railway junction of [[Chop, Ukraine|Chop]], then known as Csap.

According to the 1910 census, the city had 16,919 inhabitants, of which 13,590 (80.3%) were [[Magyars]], 1,219 (7.2%) [[Slovaks]], 1,151 (6.8%) [[Germans]], 641 (3.8%) [[Rusyns]] and 1.6% [[Czech people|Czechs]].<ref>Atlas and Gazetteer of Historic Hungary 1914, [http://www.talmakiado.hu/ Talma Kiadó] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114044438/http://www.talmakiado.hu/ |date=14 January 2017}}</ref> By religion, 5,481 [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], 5,305 [[Jews|Jewish]], 4,473 [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]], 1,368 [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]. At the same time, the municipal area of the city had a population composed of 10,541 (39.05%) Hungarians, 9,908 (36.71%) Slovaks, and 5,520 (20.45%) Rusyns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Ung |title=Ung County |access-date=17 March 2007 |work=Genealogy Online |archive-date=29 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329022251/http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Ung |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===During the World Wars===
The [[First World War]] slowed down the tempo of city development. On 10 September 1919, [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathia]] was officially allocated to the Republic of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Uzhhorod became the administrative center of the territory. During these years Uzhhorod developed into an architecturally modern city, with [[Malyi Galagov]], a new government quarter, being built from scratch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://am.umodernism.com/en/|title=Uzhhorod Modernism|website=am.umodernism.com|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>

After the [[First Vienna Award]] in 1938, Uzhhorod was given back to [[Hungary]] from which it was separated after World War I.

In 1941 the Jewish population reached 9,576.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} On 19 March 1944, German troops entered the city. They established a ''[[Judenrat]]'' ([[Jewish councils in Hungary|Jewish council]]) and set up two ghettos, at the Moskovitz brickyard and Gluck lumberyard. During May 1944, all Jews were deported to Auschwitz in five different transports and subsequently murdered. Only a few hundred Jews survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Uzhhorod/|title=Uzhorod |access-date=22 March 2017 |work=Kehilalinks}}</ref>

===In the Soviet Union===
On 27 October 1944, the city was captured by the troops of the [[4th Ukrainian Front]] of the [[Red Army]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

This period brought significant changes. On the outskirts of Uzhhorod new enterprises were constructed and the old enterprises were renewed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} On 29 June 1945, Subcarpathian Ukraine was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and became a westernmost part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. This followed the assumption of local authority by the People's Committee of Transcarpathian Ukraine based in Uzhhorod and headed by a local Communist.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2001 |title=People's Council of Transcarpathian Ukraine |url=https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CP%5CE%5CPeoplehDAsCouncilofTranscarpathianUkraine.htm |access-date=12 June 2023 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}</ref> That year the Uzhhorod State University (now [[Uzhhorod National University]]) was also opened. Since January 1946 Uzhhorod was the center of newly formed Zakarpatska oblast.{{ref}}

===In Ukraine===

Since 1991 Uzhhorod has become one of 24 regional capitals within independent Ukraine. Of these, Uzhhorod is the smallest and westernmost.

In 2002, a bust of [[Tomáš Masaryk]], Czechoslovakia's first president, was unveiled in a main square of the city. A similar bust was unveiled in 1928 on the 10th anniversary of Czechoslovak independence, but was removed by the Hungarians when they took over the region in 1939.<ref>PRECLÍK, Vratislav: "Profesor Masaryk a Podkarpatská Rus právě před sto lety" (Professor Masaryk and Subcarpatian Russia just hundred years ago), in Čas: časopis Masarykova demokratického hnutí, leden - březen 2019, roč.XXVII. čís. 125.

On 15 April 2022, as part of the [[Derussification in Ukraine|derussification campaign]] that swept through Ukraine following the February 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], the Uzhhorod City Council decided to rename 58 streets connected to Russian figures.<ref name="7339760Uzhhorod">{{cite web |author=ROMAN PETRENKO|title=Ужгород тотально дерусифікують|trans-title=Uzhhorod is totally derusified|url=https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2022/04/15/7339760/|website=[[Ukrainska Pravda]] |date=15 April 2022|access-date=1 November 2022|language=uk}}</ref> United States First Lady [[Jill Biden]] visited the city on 8 May 2022, which was not announced to the public until after the visit.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/politics/jill-biden-ukraine-visit/index.html |title=First lady Jill Biden makes unannounced trip to Ukraine |website=CNN |date=8 May 2022 }}</ref>
