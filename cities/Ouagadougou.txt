==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Ouagadougou}}
===Foundation and Regional Importance===
Ouagadougou was founded possibly as early as 1050 CE by the [[Soninke Wangara]] diaspora from the [[Ghana Empire]], also known as Wagadu. The name ''Wagadugu'' means 'home of the Wagu', the Soninke subgroup that ruled Ghana.<ref name = Kane>{{cite book |last1=Kane |first1=Oumar |title=La première hégémonie peule.

The [[Mossi people]], moving north in the 14th century, conquered Wagadugu around the same time they raided [[Walata]], contributing to the decline of the [[Mali Empire]].{{sfn|Page|Davis|2005|p=176-7}} According to legend, the city was taken by Oubri, a grandson of [[Ouedraogo]].{{sfn|Page|Davis|2005|p=177}}

The eponymous Wagadugu Kingdom was founded in the 15th century,<ref> Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Ouagadougou Ouagadougou], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', US. Retrieved 29 October 2024</ref> which became the main center of the [[Mossi States]] around 1495.{{sfn|Page|Davis|2005|p=131}} The 10th Moro Naba, Nyadfo,  was the first [[Moro-Naba]] to live at Ouagadougou, in the middle of the 17th century. It became the permanent capital under the 21st Moro Naba, Zombre, a century later.<ref name = dictionary>{{cite book |last1=McFarland |first1=Daniel Miles |last2=Rupley |first2=Lawrence |title=Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso |date=1998 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=London |page=97}}</ref> The [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]] is still performed every Friday by the Moro-Naba and his court. The 24th Moro Naba, Doulougou, built the first mosque in Ouagadougou early in the nineteenth century.<ref name = dictionary/>

===Colonialism===
On September 5th 1896 French forces entered Ouagadougou and burned the city to the ground.{{sfn|Johnson|2010}} In 1919 the colonial administration made Ouagadougou the capital of the [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] territory, extensively rebuilding the town. In 1954 the railroad line from [[Ivory Coast]] reached the city, spurring massive population growth.<ref name = dictionary/>

===Independence===
On 15 January 2016, gunmen armed with heavy weapons [[2016 Ouagadougou attacks|attacked central Ouagadougou]] at the Cappuccino restaurant and the Splendid Hotel. 28 people were killed,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35330169 |title=Ouagadougou blasts: Burkina Faso capital hit by gunfire |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2016 |access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="France24">{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20160115-shots-explosions-heard-hotel-burkina-faso-capital-ouagadougou |title=Gunmen attack hotel, take hostages in Burkina Faso capital |date=15 January 2015}}</ref> and at least 56 wounded; after a government counterattack, a total of 176 [[hostage]]s were released<ref>{{Cite web |title=Burkina Faso: Security forces raid besieged hotel, free hostages |date=16 January 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/africa/burkina-faso-hotel-terrorist-attack/index.html |publisher=CNN |access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref> the morning after the initial attack.

==Climate==
{{see also|Burkina Faso#Geography and climate}}
Ouagadougou's climate is [[hot semi-arid climate|hot semi-arid]] (''BSh'') under [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen-Geiger classification]], and closely borders with [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]] (''Aw''). The city is part of the Sudano-Sahelian area, with annual rainfall of about {{cvt|800|mm}}. The [[rainy season]] stretches from May to September, with an average temperature of {{cvt|28|C|1}}. The cool season runs from October to February, with a minimum average temperature of {{cvt|16|C|1}}. The maximum temperature during the hot season, which runs from March to April, can reach {{cvt|43|C|1}}. The [[harmattan]] (a dry wind) and the [[West African Monsoon]] are the two main factors that determine Ouagadougou's climate. Being further north, Ouagadougou's warmest months are slightly hotter and drier than those of [[Bobo-Dioulasso#Climate|Bobo-Dioulasso]], the country's [[list of cities in Burkina Faso#Largest cities|second most populous]] city.

==Government==
[[File:Hotel de ville Ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|Town Hall of Ouagadougou]]
Ouagadougou's first municipal elections were held in 1956.<ref name=":0" />

The city is divided into five [[arrondissement|arrondissements]], consisting of 30 sectors, which are subdivided into districts.{{cn|date=December 2022}} Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin, Kamsaoghin, Koulouba, Moemmin, Niogsin, Paspanga, Peuloghin, Bilbalogho, and Tiendpalogo.

Ouagadougou's communes have invested in huge city-management projects. This is largely because Ouagadougou constitutes a 'cultural centre' by merit of holding the [[SIAO]] (International Arts and Crafts fair) and the [[FESPACO]] (Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou). Moreover, the villages' growing affluence allows for such investment, and the population's rapid growth necessitates it.<ref name="Com"/>

== Economy ==
[[File:Ouagadougou place nations unies.JPG|thumb|Ouagadougou's busy city centre]]
The economy of Ouagadougou is based on industry and commerce. Some industrial facilities have relocated from [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] to Ouagadougou, which has made the city an important industrial centre of Burkina Faso. The industrial areas of [[Kossodo]] and [[Gounghin, Ouagadougou|Gounghin]] are home to several processing plants and factories. The industry of Ouagadougou is sector that fuels urban growth, as people move to the city from the countryside to find employment in industry.<ref name=oue>{{cite news |last1=Ouedraogo |first1=R Ulysse Emmanuel |title=Chapitre 1 : Ouagadougou, une agglomération dynamique |publisher=University of Ouagadougou |language=fr}}</ref> The Copromof workshop in Ouagadougou sews cotton [[lingerie]] for the French label "Atelier Augusti."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Alex Duval |title=Burkina Faso's French knicker-makers |work=BBC News – Africa |access-date=9 July 2014 |date=1 July 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28055138}}</ref>

Ouagadougou is an important commercial centre. It is a centre where goods are collected and directed to rural areas. With a large consumer base, large amounts of energy sources, raw materials for buildings, agricultural products and livestock products are imported to the city.<ref name=oue/>

The economy is dominated by the [[informal sector]], which is characterized by petty commodity production, and workers not necessarily having salaries. Traditional, informal trade is widespread and concentrated around markets and major roads, as well as in outlets in neighborhoods. There are also instances of modern economic practices with workplaces having qualified, stable labor forces, or more traditional forms of business such as family businesses.<ref name=oue/>

==Parks==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=January 2024}}
The Bangr-Weoogo urban park (area: {{cvt|2.63|km2|sqmi|0}}), before colonialism, belonged to the Mosse chiefs. Considering it a sacred forest, many went there for traditional initiations or for refuge. The French colonists, disregarding its local significance and history, established it as a park in the 1930s. In 1985, renovations were done in the park. In January 2001, the park was renamed "Parc Urbain Bangr-Weoogo", meaning "the urban park of the forest of knowledge".

Another notable park in Ouagadougou is the "L'Unité Pédagogique", which shelters animals in a semi-free state. This botanic garden/biosphere system stretches over {{cvt|8|ha|acre}} and also serves as a museum for the country's history.

"Jardin de l'amitié Ouaga-Loudun" (Garden of Ouaga-Loudun Friendship), with a green space that was renovated in 1996, is a symbol of the twin-city relationship between Ouagadougou and Loudun in France. It is situated in the centre of the city, near the "Nation Unies' crossroads".
