'''Pallavaram''' (originally '''Pallava Puram''') is a southern suburb of [[Chennai]], [[India]]. It lies in the [[Chengalpattu district|district of Chengalpattu]], situated within the [[Chennai metropolitan area|Chennai Metropolitan Area]], [[Tamil Nadu]] state.  

Formerly a [[Municipality]] under [[Alandur]] taluk, it was bifurcated in August 2015 to form a new taluk.In November 2021, the town was merged with [[Tambaram City Municipal Corporation]]. The neighborhood is known for its cantonment and bustling residential colonies and is served by [[Pallavaram railway station]] of the [[Chennai Suburban Railway Network]]. 

Pallavaram has a long history and has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The town derives its name from the [[Pallava]] settlement of ''Pallavapuram'' of which it used to form a part. The cantonment and aerodrome were established during British rule. The British also carried out [[charnockite]] mining activities on Pallavaram Hill.

==History==
[[File:Pallavaram Hill Runway NE Chennai Airport Aug22 A7C 02296.jpg|thumb|left|Pallavaram Hill]]
Pallavaram is considered to be one of the oldest inhabited places in South India. A major archaeological find was made in the year 1863 when the British archaeologist [[Robert Bruce Foote]] discovered a stone implement from the [[Paleolithic Age]] inside a ballast pit.<ref name="muthiahp129">[[#Muthiah|Muthiah]], Pg 129</ref> Since then, a number of Stone Age artifacts have been uncovered.<ref name="muthiahp129" /> Most of these artifacts are currently lodged in the [[Government Museum, Chennai|Egmore museum]].<ref name="muthiahp129" />

Together with Chromepet, the Pallavaram area was referred to as "Pallavapuram."<ref name="Muthiah_2014">{{cite book | last = Muthiah| first = S. | author-link = S.

Both the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[British East India Company]] had their cantonments in Pallavaram. During the 17th century, Pallavaram remained dependent for sometime, upon the Portuguese colony of [[San Thome]]. During the 18th century, the British established a cantonment at Pallavaram, supplementary to the one at [[St. Thomas Mount]]. A [[wireless base station|wireless station]] was established in the early years of the 20th century. The Madras aerodrome was opened at Pallavaram in 1929.

==Geography== 
The area of Pallavaram is divided into Zamin Pallavaram, Old Pallavaram, Essa Pallavaram and Cantonment Pallavaram.

===Pallavaram Lake===
[[Pallavaram Lake]] (or Pallavaram periya eri, literally meaning 'big lake'), once a sprawling water body covering about 189 acres, has shrunk to a small patch on the lines of a pond on one side and a hillock of garbage on the other. The dumping of garbage from all the 42 wards of the Pallavaram Municipality for nearly a decade is the main reason for the shrinkage of the water body. Nearly 25 acres had been lost to encroachments alone. The construction of Pallavaram–Thoraipakkam Road, a project initiated to connect [[Chennai Airport]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi Salai]], had split the lake into two halves. The portion of the lake on the southern side of the road has completely been covered by garbage. On the northern side of the road, the discharge of sewage from commercial establishments and homes and also effluents from some of the leather manufacturing units in Nagalakeni has affected the quality of the water. This is one of the oldest Palaeolithic culture site.<ref>{{cite news
