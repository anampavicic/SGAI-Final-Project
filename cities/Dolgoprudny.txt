A settlement of '''Vinogradovo''' situated in the place of the modern town was known at least since the 17th century. Then a railway was built in the 1900s (decade) and a railway platform was built in 1914. The settlement started to develop as an [[airship]] manufacturing plant was built there in 1931. The aeronautic engineer [[Umberto Nobile]] worked there for five years during the 1930s. For a few years during the 1930s, the settlement was renamed '''Dirizhablestroy''' (meaning "airship building"). In 1951, the famous [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] or Phystech, moved to Dolgoprudny, and a construction of its present campus started in the southern part of the town, inspired by the [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Pyotr Kapitsa]], [[Lev Landau]], and [[Nikolay Semyonov]].
