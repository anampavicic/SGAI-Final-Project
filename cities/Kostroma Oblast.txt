==History==
From c. 300 CE the current area of Kostroma, with the exception of the area east of the [[Unzha River]], was part of the Finno-Ugric peoples' lands, such as the [[Merya people|Merya]] people and their loose tribal confederation. During the Neolithic era, comb-ceramics replaced prafinno-Ugric Volosovo. At the turn of 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, the Fatyanovo culture arrived in the area, later to be assimilated into the tribes of the [[Late Bronze Age]] (the [[Abashevo culture]] and the [[Pozdnyakovskaya culture]]). The Finno-Ugric component as a result of migration and assimilation and grew even stronger since the culture of the [[early Iron Age]]. The people who developed the art of smelting of bog ore are already clearly Finno-Ugric in character. As a result of the mixing of the Finno-Ugric and [[pyanoborskoy Anan'ino]] local cultures with the Finno-Ugric [[Dyakovo culture]] came the [[Mari people]], which began to take shape in Kostroma. Historically, the Kostroma region is a territory of Mari residence. In the currently existing settlements and the Old-[[Kazhirovo]] [[Shangskoe]] where the capitals of the Mari principalities of [[Yaksha, Kostroma Oblast|Yaksha]] and Sanga. Possession of these kingdoms in the north to reach the Great in earlier times. The village area was Odoevskoye SHARINSKY Mari fortress Bulaksy.

There were at least 109 Merya settlements located in the area of which the most important below mentioned trading centers and important hill fortresses were later recorded by the Russians as the Russians founded towns in the late 9th to 12th centuries.

With the death in 1277 of Basil Yaroslavovych, who had no children and left no heirs, the land principality as unclaimed moved into the Vladimir principality. Then, the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich Dmitry lost Kostroma principality to his brother Andrei Alexandrovich Gorodetsky, who in turn gave this inheritance to his nephew, the son of Dmitry Ivan Dmitrievich, but shortly after Ivan D. to possess Pereiaslavl-Zaleski and Kostroma principality newly departed Andrei Alexandrovich and then in 1299, he gave the land to his son Boris. After the latter's death in 1303, the prince of Kostroma in 1304 was the son of [[Daniel of Moscow]], Boris Daniilovich. At this relative independence of the Principality of Kostroma ended and later it became part of the lands of the princely [[Tsardom of Russia|House of Moscow]].

For the first time in what is now the area were separated from each other by Peter I: in 1708 by dividing the country into provinces were created in the province of Kostroma, Moscow province, and in the Galician province of Arkhangelsk province. In 1778, the two territories were re-united in the Kostroma governorship, which has been linked with the Yaroslavl first, then with the Nizhny Novgorod, and later with the Governor-General in one of Vladimir General Government.

In 1797 Paul I abolished the Governor-General Vladimir and Kostroma and Kostroma instead governorship was created Kostroma Province, which existed in constant borders until 1917.

The conversion of the Kostroma province center sped up its economic and cultural development, even though in 1773 and 1779, the city was completely burned in the fire fighting. Since 1781 the city began to be built on the master plan, which was based on a radial- concentric grid of streets that converged on a large semi-circular central area in the open side of the Volga.

The end of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century is rightly considered the rise in cultural development (architecture, painting, literature), not only of Kostroma but also of other county-level cities such as Galic, Nerekhta, and Soligalich. Architectural ensembles in the classical style still adorn the centers of these cities. There were widespread noble estates, which have become centers of culture in the remote outskirts of the province.

After the October Revolution of 1917, Kostroma Province became part formed in 1918 by the Russian Federation.

In the linen industry, which has been leading in the province, there were only 4.7 million workers ( in 1913 - 15 thousand). At the first Republican Factory ( the former Big linen manufactory ), their number decreased from 7 to 1 million people in the mechanical plant of 1,300 workers have only 450. Due to lack of fuel and raw materials factory operated for only 6 months a year, from May to October - idle.

In the city of Kostroma in 1917, there were 17 libraries. Kostroma Province existed prior to 1917. Almost doubled compared with the prewar decreased acreage and yield of crops. The total cultivated area in the province in 1920 vs. 1917 dropped by 43%, including linen - 80%, barley - 62%, potatoes - by 50%, oats - by 50%, rye - 20% .

The university initially acted natural, humanitarian, and forest departments, and later - Teachers and Department of the Faculty of Medicine. In 1921, all faculties studied 3,333 students. Most of the teachers came from Moscow. Following the university in Kostroma in 1919, two more high schools - the Institute of Electrical and chemical industry and land management institute, were opened to prepare engineering and agricultural personnel.

Due to the severe consequences of the civil war and the transition to a new economic policy that resulted in the reduction of funding of educational institutions, the People's Commissariat of Education in autumn 1921 decided to close or reorganize several young university. Kostroma University was divided into two universities - Pedagogical Institute (Institute of Education ), and agricultural. Teacher's college in 1923 was reorganized into pedtehnikum. By the second half of the 1920s. of the four high schools and three secondary special educational institutions operating in the province in the first years of Soviet power, down to seven colleges. From 1922 to 1923, the number of educational institutions in the province of Kostroma has decreased by almost 25%.
