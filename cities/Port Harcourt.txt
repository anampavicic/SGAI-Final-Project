[[File:Port Harcourt, Nigeria Population Density and Low Elevation Coastal Zones (5457306925).jpg|thumb|Population density and low elevation coastal zones in the Port Harcourt region. Port Harcourt is especially vulnerable to [[sea level rise]].]]
The main city of Port Harcourt is the Port Harcourt City in the [[Port Harcourt (local government area)|Port Harcourt local government area]], consisting of the former European quarters now called [[Old GRA]] and New Layout areas. The urban area (Port Harcourt metropolis), on the other hand, is made up of the local government area itself and parts of [[Obio-Akpor]] and [[Eleme, Rivers|Eleme]] accordingly.<ref>Ogbonna, D. N. / Amangabara, G. T. / Ekere, T.

In 2009, a law was passed by the [[Rivers State House of Assembly]] and Governor Amaechi's administration to spread development to the surrounding communities as part of the effort to decongest the Port Harcourt metropolis. The [[Greater Port Harcourt]] region, spans eight local government areas that include Port Harcourt, [[Okrika]], [[Obio-Akpor]], [[Ikwerre, Rivers|Ikwerre]], [[Oyigbo]], [[Ogu–Bolo]], [[Etche]] and [[Eleme, Rivers State|Eleme]]. Its total population was estimated at 2,000,000 as of 2009, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in Nigeria. But that number has greatly increased according to recent studies.<ref name="TheTide">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2012/05/27/the-greater-port-harcourt-project-...myth-or-reality/|title=The Greater Port Harcourt Project ...Myth or Reality?|work=[[The Tide (Nigeria)|The Tide]]|date=27 May 2012|access-date=6 August 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218125951/http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2012/05/27/the-greater-port-harcourt-project-%E2%80%A6myth-or-reality/|archive-date=18 February 2017}}</ref>

[[File:1st Artilery Cross Road, Phc.jpg|thumb|alt=A picture of the Port Harcourt City centre from a highway with traffic and high rises in the distance|Traffic in the Port Harcourt City Centre]]

The increased [[Deterioration of Minds|deterioration]] of ambient air quality led to a state protest in February 2017. There were experiences of black soot settling in nostrils, on cars, floors, roofs, windows, bathtubs, bathrooms, kitchen sinks and household furniture surfaces resulting in frequent cleaning of affected surfaces and places. potable, domestic and rainwater were equally affected. Abuloma, Iwofe, Rupokwu, [[Okrika]], and Woji were mostly affected with other areas such as Rumuigbo, Eleme, and [[Oyigbo]] Local Government Councils, as well as [[Ogoni people|Ogoni.]]<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2017-02-19 |title=Air pollution: Rivers resident decry invasion by black soot |url=https://guardian.ng/sunday-magazine/air-pollution-rivers-resident-decry-invasion-by-black-soot/ |first= Kelvin |last=Ebiri|access-date=2022-03-05 |website=The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News |language=en-US}}</ref>

The covering of the haze of soot in most parts of the city has resulted in visibility impairment by PM2.5, soil, and water deposition, and disruption in [[ecosystem]] diversity.  This also made the city dwellers spend more time indoors than outdoors. Residents in cities such as Rumosi and Rumuodumanya in [[Obio-Akpor|Obio/Akpor]] Council have relocated to other safe cities leading to a decline in business activities.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-02-18 |title=Residents leave Port Harcourt over sooth emission |url=https://guardian.ng/features/health/residents-leave-port-harcourt-over-sooth-emission/ |first=Ann |last=Godwin|access-date=2022-03-05 |website=The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Federal Ministry of Environment (Nigeria)|The Ministry of Environment]] took action by analysing air samples from various sites in the city and found out to be 11 times higher than [[World Health Organization|WHO]] specifications for PM2.5 and PM10. This non-compliance was tackled by shutting down the Chinese Government Company (CGC), H&H Engineering Company, and AUC Asphalt Company located in the Aluu community, found to be the location of high volume discharge of emissions thereby contravening environmental regulations. Illegal refineries, burning of tires, [[gas flaring]], [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) operations and processes, [[Petrochemical|petro-chemical]] companies and refineries were other suspected sources of soot [[pollution]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />
