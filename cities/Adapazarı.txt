==History==
The history of Adapazarı dates back to 378 BC, when it was called '''Agrilion''' (Ἀγρίλιον in [[Greek language|Greek]]). Ancient settlers included [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Bithynia]]ns, [[Cimmerians]], [[Lydians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], but Adapazarı got its identity from the ancient [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Byzantine]] rulers. After [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests, the [[Persians]] were forced out of the region.

One of the most important remains of historical significance is the [[Sangarius Bridge]] ({{langx|tr|Beş Köprü}}) built by [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] in 533 AD. Historically, it was situated on the old military road from [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) to the east, connected, since the end of the 19th century, by a branch line with the [[Anatolia]]n [[railway]].<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Adabazar|volume=1|page=166}}</ref> It was founded in 1400 by 400 [[Armenians|Armenian]] immigrant families who escaped from [[Timur]]'s oppression in [[Sivas]] and was named "Donigaşen" after the name of their leaders. Today's inhabitants are [[Manavs]]. The Native [[Muslims]] are [[Armenians]] and [[Greeks]] who gradually converted to [[Islam]], and it should not be ignored that [[Turkish people|Turk]] households settled in the region. Adapazarı's known name in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] at that time was Adacık and Ada. The source of the information that the region was conquered by [[Orhan|Orhan Gazi]] and opened to settlement is also unknown.<ref>Adapazarlı Papaz Krikor Vekayinamesi (Püzantion dergisi, 31 Ocak 1912).</ref><ref>XV.

In 1868, the Adapazarı Municipality was officially founded on the town called Der Seadet. A sugar factory and agricultural sugar factory attracted many migrants and accelerated the industrialization of the city. A law passed on 17 June 1954 in the Grand National Assembly saw the city separated from Kocaeli Province and made the center of its own province. The [[1999 İzmit earthquake|1999 Marmara earthquake]] affected Adapazarı and inflicted losses in lives and damage. In 2008 the district Adapazarı was created from part of the former central district of Adapazarı Province, along with the districts [[Arifiye]], [[Erenler, Sakarya|Erenler]] and [[Serdivan]]. At the same time, the province was renamed Sakarya after the Sakarya River which runs through it.<ref>[https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2008/03/20080322M1-1.htm Kanun No. 5747], Resmî Gazete, 22 March 2008.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=İl İdaresi ve Mülki Bölümler Şube Müdürlüğü İstatistikleri - İl ve İlçe Kuruluş Tarihleri |url=https://www.icisleri.gov.tr/kurumlar/icisleri.gov.tr/IcSite/illeridaresi/İstatistiki%20Bilgiler/İl%20İdaresi%20ve%20Mülki%20Bölümler/il%20ilce%20kurulus%20tarihleri_2019.pdf |access-date=11 October 2023|page=71 |language=tr}}</ref>

Adapazarı is the location of a large automobile factory owned by the [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], as well as the [[EUROTEM|Hyundai EURotem]] train factory. Tank Pallet 1st Main Maintenance, one of the biggest Turkish defense contractors, and [[Otokar]], a major manufacturer of buses and military vehicles, are located in Sakarya. Other major industries in the city and its [[Sakarya Province|surrounding province]] include textile factories for [[silk]] and [[linen]] products. Agriculture and forestry also form an important part of the city's economy, with the production of [[tobacco]], hazelnuts (fındık variety), [[walnut|walnut-wood]], [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoons]] and [[vegetables]]. Adapazari is one of the most important industrial capitals of Turkey. While Turkey is a developing country, the city of Adapazari renovated its infrastructure and industry after the 17 August 1999 catastrophic earthquake which left more than 18,000 casualties behind. In memory of the earthquake municipality had built a museum of earthquake in city center.

==Education and culture==
The only university in the city is [[Sakarya University]], one of the largest universities in Turkey in terms of student enrollment. Since its establishment in 1992, Sakarya University has influenced the culture of the city and transformed public life.

In addition to the university, many different institutions shape and influence the culture of the city. Adapazarı Kültür Merkezi (Adapazarı Culture Center), Ofis Sanat Merkezi (Ofis Art Center), and Sakarya Sanat Galerisi (Sakarya Art Gallery) are the main cultural institutions led by the municipality. Adapazari also hosts non-governmental cultural and educational organizations. Of them, Sakarya Bilgi Kültür Merkezi provides educational and cultural activities.

Kent Park features an authentic, picturesque reconstruction of an historic water wheel that once provided fresh drinking water from the Çark River to public spigots located every few blocks throughout the city. The original wooden water wheel, commonly known as the Çark Wheel, was maintained and refurbished to operate in one form or another from 1724 to 1955.

==Sports==

Adapazarı is home to [[Sakaryaspor]]. Sakaryaspor has won the [[Fortis Turkey Cup|Turkish Cup]] once and has played in the [[Süper Lig]] for 11 seasons. They were promoted again to the [[TFF First League]] in 2011, the second level in the [[Football in Turkey|Turkish football pyramid]], as they beat [[Konya Şeker S.K.]], [[Bugsaşspor]] and [[Bandırmaspor]] consecutively in the play-off games of the [[TFF Second League]]. However they were relegated in the following season, and since 2013 they have played in the [[TFF Third League]]. Even though Sakaryaspor is not always a permanent team in the Süper Lig, they have raised many of Turkey's best players, such as [[Hakan Şükür]], [[Tuncay (footballer)|Tuncay]], [[Oğuz Çetin]], [[Aykut Kocaman]] and many more.
