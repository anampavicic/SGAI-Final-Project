'''Suez''' ({{langx|arz|السويس|as-Suways}}, {{IPA|arz|esseˈweːs|pron}}) is a [[Port#Seaport|seaport city]] (population of about 700,000 {{as of|2021|8|lc=y}}) in north-eastern [[Egypt]], located on the north coast of the [[Gulf of Suez]] on the [[Red Sea]], near the southern terminus of the [[Suez Canal]], and is the capital of the  [[Suez Governorate]]. It has three ports: the [[Suez Port]] (Port Tewfik), al-Adabiya,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sczone.eg/services/al-adabiya-port/ | title=Al Adabiya port – SCZONE }}</ref> and al-Zaytiya,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rspa.gov.eg/port-zytyat.html | title=الهيئة العامة لموانئ البحر الأحمر &#124;&#124; الموقع الرسمي }}</ref> and extensive port facilities. Together they form a [[metropolitan area]], located mostly in [[Africa]] with a small portion in [[Asia]].

{{Coord|29|58|N|32|33|E|region:EG_type:city|display=title}}Railway lines and highways connect the city with [[Cairo]], [[Port Said]], and [[Ismailia]].  Suez has a petrochemical plant, and its oil refineries have pipelines carrying the finished product to Cairo. These are represented in the flag of the governorate: the blue background refers to the sea, the gear refers to Suez's status as an industrial governorate, and the flame refers to the petroleum firms of Suez.

The modern city of Suez is a successor of the ancient city of [[Clysma]], a major Red Sea port and a center of monasticism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mayerson|first=Philip|title=The Port of Clysma (Suez) in Transition from Roman to Arab Rule|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|year=1996|volume=55|issue=2|pages=119–126|doi=10.1086/373802|jstor=546035|s2cid=163029985}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The city's name is derived from a {{transl|ar|[[diminutive|fuʿayl]]}} form of the [[Arabic]] word for '[[liquorice]]' ({{Langx|ar|سُوس|translit=sūs|links=no}}).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stefan |first=Timm |title=Das christlich-koptische Agypten in arabischer Zeit |year=1988 |pages=2425}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Freytag |first=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich |url=http://archive.org/details/lexiconarabicol1v2frey |title=Lexicon arabico-latinum praesertim ex Djeuharii Firuzabadiique et aliorum Arabum operibus, adhibitis Golii quoque et aliorum libris confectum.

==History==
===Achaemenid era===
[[Darius the Great]]'s [[Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions|Suez Inscriptions]] were texts written in [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] on five monuments erected in Wadi Tumilat, commemorating the opening of a canal between the [[Nile]] and the [[Bitter Lakes]], to facilitate a shipping connection between Egypt, then a [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|satrapy]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and Persia (i.e. the greater portion of the Empire itself).

====Text of the Suez Inscriptions====
Partial transliteration and translation of the inscription:

Transliteration of the Old Persian text:
{{lang|peo|xâmanišiya \ thâtiy \ Dârayavauš \ XŠ \ adam \ Pârsa \ amiy \ hacâ \ Pâ rsâ \ Mudrâyam \ agarbâyam \ adam \ niyaštâyam \ imâm \ yauviyâ m \ katanaiy \ hacâ \ Pirâva \ nâma \ rauta \ tya \ Mudrâyaiy \ danuvatiy \ ab iy \ draya \ tya \ hacâ \ Pârsâ \ aitiy \ pasâva \ iyam \ yauviyâ \ akaniya \ avathâ \ yathâ \ adam \ niyaštâyam \ utâ \ nâva \ âyatâ \ hacâ \ Mudrâ yâ \ tara \ imâm \ yauviyâm \ abiy \ Pârsam \ avathâ \ yathâ \ mâm \ kâma\ âha}}

English translation:
"King Darius says: I am a Persian; setting out from Persia I conquered Egypt. I ordered to dig this canal from the river that is called Nile and flows in Egypt, to the sea that begins in Persia. Therefore, when this canal had been dug as I had ordered, ships went from Egypt through this canal to Persia, as I had intended."

===Early Islamic era===
In the 7th century AD a town named "[[Clysma|Kolzum]]" stood just north of the site of present-day Suez and served as eastern terminus of a canal built by [[Amr ibn al-'As]], linking the [[Nile River]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Kolzum's trade fell following the closure of the canal in 770 by the second [[Abbasid]] caliph, [[al-Mansur]], to prevent his enemies in [[Arabia]] from accessing supplies from Egypt and the lands north of it. Nonetheless, the town benefited from the trade that remained between Egypt and Arabia.<ref name="Chisholm22">Chisholm, p.22.</ref> By 780 al-Mansur's successor [[al-Mahdi]] restored part of the canal.<ref name="Houtsma498">Houtsma, p.498.</ref> The [[Qarmatians]] led by [[al-Hasan al-A'sam]] defeated a [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] army headed by [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]] at Kolzum in 971 and thereby captured the town. Following his defeat in [[Cairo]] by al-Siqilli at the end of that year, Hasan and his forces retreated to Arabia via Kolzum.<ref name="Houtsma1115">Houtsma, p.1115.</ref> Suez was situated nearby and served as a source of drinking water for Kolzum, according to the [[Arab]] traveler [[al-Muqaddasi]], who visited in 986.<ref>Forgotten Books, p.61. Quotes [[al-Muqaddasi]].</ref>

The [[Ayyubid]] sultan of Egypt, [[Saladin]], fortified both Kolzum and Suez in order to defend Egypt's eastern frontier from [[Crusades|Crusader]] raids by [[Raynald of Chatillon]].<ref>Houtsma, 1993, p.341.</ref> Between 1183 and 1184, Raynald had ships stationed in the [[Red Sea]] to prevent the Ayyubid garrison at Kolzum from accessing water. In response, Saladin's brother [[al-Adil]] had [[Husam ad-Din Lu'lu']] build a naval fleet, which sailed to the southern port of [[Aidab]] to end Raynald's venture.<ref name="Houtsma1115"/> By the 13th century, it was recorded that Kolzum was in ruins, as was Suez, which had gradually replaced the former as a population center.<ref name="Chisholm22"/> According to Muslim historians [[al-Maqrizi]] and [[al-Idrisi]], Kolzum had once been a prosperous town, until it was occupied and plundered by [[Bedouin]]s. Arab geographer [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|al-Dimashqi]] noted that Kolzum belonged to the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] province of [[Al Karak|al-Karak]] at the time.<ref name="Houtsma1115"/>

To prevent [[Portugal|Portuguese]] attacks against Egyptian coastal towns and the Red Sea port of [[Jeddah]], [[Qansuh al-Ghawri]], the last [[Burji dynasty|Mamluk]] sultan, ordered a 6,000-man force headed by [[Selman Reis]] to defend Suez in 1507, which in turn limited the Mamluk military's capabilities against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref>Brummett, p.85 and p.115.</ref> Following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt at the beginning of the 16th century, Suez became both a major naval and trading station.

==== Portuguese attacks ====

In trying to limit the [[Ottoman Navy]] to the Red Sea, after the [[Siege of Diu (1538)|siege of Diu]] in 1538, a Portuguese fleet was sent in 1541 to seek out and destroy the Ottoman navy. After capturing [[El Tor, Egypt|El Tor]] on the Egyptian coast, the fleet's commander [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] gave the order to attack Suez, but failed to engage the Ottoman fleet as the Ottomans had received intelligence about the incoming attack beforehand. Instead, the Portuguese fleet spent the next 7 months in the Red Sea sailing from port to port and waiting in [[Massawa]] before eventually leaving for India.{{fact|date=September 2024}}

German explorer [[Carsten Niebuhr]] noted that in the 18th century a 20-strong fleet sailed annually from Suez to [[Jeddah]], which served both as [[Mecca]]'s port and Egypt's gateway for trade with India. However, by the [[French invasion of Egypt and Syria]] in 1798, Suez had once again devolved into an unimportant town. Fighting between [[French Revolutionary Army|French]] and [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman troops]] in 1800 left most of the town in ruins.<ref name="Chisholm22" /> Its importance as a port increased after the Suez Canal opened in 1869.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item124188.html#:~:text=In%201869%2C%20the%20Suez%20Canal,to%20travel%20round%20southern%20Africa | title=Opening of the Suez Canal }}</ref>

===Modern era===
The city was virtually destroyed during battles in the late 1960s and early 1970s between Egyptian and Israeli forces occupying the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The town was deserted following the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. [[Avraham Adan]] tried to [[Battle of Suez|capture the city]] but it failed, it cost the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) 80 troops killed, 120 wounded and 40 tanks destroyed. Reconstruction of Suez began soon after Egypt reopened the Suez Canal, following the [[Yom Kippur War]] with Israel.

Suez was the first city to hold major protests against the government of [[Hosni Mubarak]] during the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] and was the scene of the first fatality of that uprising.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/revolutionthrougharabeyes/2011/12/20111229132934234283.html Suez: Cradle of Revolt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309202008/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/revolutionthrougharabeyes/2011/12/20111229132934234283.html |date=2012-03-09 }}.

[[File:Container Ship 'Ever Given' stuck in the Suez Canal, Egypt - March 24th, 2021 cropped.jpg|thumb|right| Obstruction at Suez; a container ship got stuck in March 2021]]
In 2021, the container ship ''[[Ever Given]]'' became stuck across the Suez canal near Suez. This came to be known as the [[2021 Suez Canal obstruction]].

==City districts==
The city is divided into five main districts:

===El Arbaeen District===
[[File:Dom João de Castro - Roteiro do Mar Roxo - Suez.jpg|thumb|291x291px|Suez, in 1541 in drawing by Dom João de Castro ( Roteiro do Mar Roxo)]]
The most populous district of the city, it has most of the government buildings and public institutions. It also has the city's main fruit and vegetable markets in addition to other markets and stores selling various commodities.

===Suez District===
[[File:Suez city hall.JPG|thumb|Suez Governorate city hall]]
Suez district is considered the most affluent area in the city. The real estate there is significantly more expensive than any other district in the city. Its buildings have more modern architectural style than those in the El Arbaeen District. It includes the affluent neighbourhood of Port Tawfik, which directly overlooks the Suez Canal. Port Tawfik includes some old-style houses that date back to the era of English occupation. The district also includes two of Egypt's most important oil refineries; El-Nasr Petroleum Company and Suez Petroleum Company. Also, [[Suez Port]], one of Egypt's main ports, lies within the perimeter of Suez District.

===El Ganayen District===
This district stretches all the way to the border with Ismailia Governorate and contains the entire Asian territory of the city. It has all the rural areas of the city and can be thought of as the city's "countryside".

===Faisal District===
It includes the newer neighbourhoods of the city. Most of the areas at Faisal District were established after the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|Yom Kippur war]], which had destroyed vast areas of the city. Examples of neighborhoods in Faisal District include Al-Sabbah, Al-Amal and Al-Mushi, to name a few.

===Ataqah District===
It is characterised by the existence of many industrial areas. There are plants and factories specialising in fertilisers, cement, steel, cooking oil, flour products, oil rigs, ceramic tiles, sugar, and many other products. There is also the Attaka Power Plant.

The district also includes Ain Sokhna, one of Egypt's most important sea resorts, overlooking the Gulf of Suez. Ain Sokhna has numerous high-class sea resorts and is frequented by many tourists, Egyptians and foreigners, all over the year due to its warm weather. The district is also home to the Ain Sokhna Sea Port, one of Egypt's main sea ports operated by the Dubai-based DP World Company and the Al-Ataka Fishing Port, which is the city's main fish production port.

==Suez Canal==

[[File:EG-suez-19-bg-suez.jpg|thumb|Suez Canal shoreline]]
In ancient times, there was a canal from the Nile delta to the Gulf of Suez, when the gulf extended further north than it does today.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Suez Canal |volume=26 |pages=22–25}}</ref> This canal fell into disuse, and the present canal was built in the nineteenth century.
[[File:Salam Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Sunset]] view from land to [[Suez Canal Bridge]], which links Africa with Asia]]
The Suez Canal offers a significantly shorter passage for ships, as compared to passing round the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The construction of the Suez Canal was favoured by the natural conditions of the region: the comparatively short distance between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the occurrence of a line of lakes or depressions which became lakes ([[Lake Manzala]] in the north, and depressions, [[Timsah]] and the Bitter Lakes, part way along the route), and the generally flat terrain. The construction of the canal was proposed by the engineer and French diplomat [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], who in 1854 acquired from [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said Pasha]] the rights of constructing and operating the canal for a period of 99 years. The ''Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez'' was formed. Construction took 11 years, and the canal opened on 17 November 1869. The canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade.

In July 1956, just a few days after the fourth anniversary of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], the Egyptian government under President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the Suez Canal Company, which had been run by the French and owned privately, with the British as the largest shareholders. In 1956, Israeli, British and French forces invaded the Suez Canal, which became known as the [[Suez Crisis]]. Following Israel's invasion and occupation of the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, the Canal was closed, and did not reopen until 1975.

On March 23, 2021, a [[container ship]] called the [[Ever Given]] ran aground in the canal and blocked it.<ref>[https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html A huge ship is blocking a vital trade artery. It could get costly] Julia Horowitz, CNN Business; updated 25 March 2021 ''www.cnn.com'', accessed 1 April 2021</ref>

Today, the Canal is a vital link in world trade, and contributes significantly to the Egyptian economy; in 2009 the income generated from the canal accounted for 3.7% of Egypt's GDP.<ref>''The Economist'', July 17–23, 2010, A Favored Spot: Egypt is making the most of its natural advantages.</ref>
