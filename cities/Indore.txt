Modern-day Indore traces its roots to its 16th-century founding as a trading hub between the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and [[Delhi]]. It was founded on the banks of the [[Kanh River|Kanh]] and [[Saraswati River (Madhya Pradesh)|Saraswati]] rivers. The city came under the [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha Empire]], on 18 May 1724, after [[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao I]] assumed the full control of [[Malwa]]. During the days of the British Raj, [[Indore State]] was a 19 [[Salute state|Gun Salute]] (21 locally) [[princely state]] (a rare high rank) ruled by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] [[House of Holkar|Holkar]] dynasty, until they acceded to the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTZHXwAACAAJ&q=Holkar+state |title=Report on the Administration of Holkar State for 1944 – Indore (India) – Google Books |access-date= 4 April 2014 |year=1946 |last1=(India) |first1=Indore }}</ref>

=== Holkar Era (Maratha Empire)===
{{main|Holkar}}

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal era]], the area under the modern Indore district was equally divided between the administrations (''[[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]]''s) of [[Ujjain]] and [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]]. Kampel was the headquarters of a ''mahal'' (administrative unit) under the Ujjain ''sarkar'' of [[Malwa Subah]] (province). The area of the modern Indore city was included in the [[Kampel, Indore|Kampel]] [[pargana]] (administrative unit).<ref name="gazetteer_1971">{{cite book |title=Madhya Pradesh District Gazetteers: Indore |editor=P. N. Shrivastav |year=1971 |edition=1st |publisher=Government Central Press |pages=2, 55–59 }}</ref>

In 1715, the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] invaded this region (Mughal territory) and demanded [[chauth]] (tax) from the Mughal ''Amil'' (administrator) of Kampel. The Amil fled to [[Ujjain]], and the local [[zamindar]]s agreed to pay Chauth to the Marathas. The chief zamindar, [[Rao Nandlal Chaudhary|Nandlal Chaudhary]] (later known as Nandlal Mandloi), paid a chauth of around Rs. 25,000 to the Marathas. [[Jai Singh II]], the Mughal Governor of Malwa, reached Kampel on 8 May 1715, and defeated the Marathas in a battle near the village. The Marathas came back in early 1716, and raided Kampel in 1717. In March 1718, the Marathas, led by [[Bhonsle (clan)|Santaji Bhonsale]], invaded Malwa again, but were unsuccessful this time.

By 1720, the headquarters of the local pargana were transferred from Kampel to Indore, due to the increasing commercial activity in the city. In 1724, the Marathas under the new [[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao I]], launched a fresh attack on the Mughals in Malwa. Baji Rao I himself led the campaign, accompanied by his lieutenants [[Dhar State|Udaji Rao Pawar]], [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] and [[Ranoji Scindia]]. The Mughal [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Nizam]] met the [[Peshwa]] at [[Nalchha]] on 18 May 1724, and acceded to his demand of collecting chauth from the area. The Peshwa returned to the [[Deccan]], but left [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] at Indore to oversee the chauth collection.

The Marathas maintained friendly relations with Nandlal Chaudhary, who held influence over the local [[Sardar]]s (chiefs). In 1728, they defeated the Mughals decisively in the battle of [[Battles involving the Maratha Empire|Amjhera]], and consolidated their authority in the area over the next few years. On 3 October 1730, [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] was appointed as the Maratha chief of [[Malwa]]. The local zamindars, who had the title of [[Chowdhury|Chaudhari]], came to be known as ''Mandloi''s (after [[tehsil|mandal]], an administrative unit) during the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha reign]]. The [[House of Holkar|Holkar]] dynasty of the Marathas, which controlled the region, conferred the title of ''Rao'' upon the local zamindar family.<ref>Major General Sir John Malcolm, ''Central India, Part I'', pp. 68–70</ref>
After Nandlal died, his son Tejkarana was accepted as the ''Mandloi'' of Kampel by the [[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao I]]. The pargana was formally granted to [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] by merging 28 and one-half Pargana by the Peshwa in 1733. The pargana headquarters were transferred back to Kampel during his reign. After his death, his daughter-in-law [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] moved the headquarters to Indore in 1766. The [[tehsil]] of Kampel was converted into Indore tehsil by a change in the name.<ref name="gazetteer_1971"/>
Ahilyabai Holkar moved the state's capital to [[Maheshwar]] in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and military center.

===Princely State (Indore/Holkar State)===

[[File:Ahilyabai Holkar 1996 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|[[Ahilyabai Holkar]] 1996 stamp of [[India]]]]
[[Ahilyabai Holkar|Ahalyabai]] Holkar is fondly remembered as a noble, saintly and courageous woman. She ruled the kingdom of Indore (which was then part of the wider [[Maratha Empire]]) for several decades. Her rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore's history. From an agricultural background herself, she married Khande Rao, prince of Indore. Thereafter, she resided in the Royal Palace. Later, she was trained in statecraft and accompanied the army to war on many occasions. At that time the [[Maratha Empire]] (which was founded by [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji Raje Bhonsale]]) was at the apex of its power. There were frequent battles and skirmishes, both against foreigners as well as internal feuds. In one such battle in 1754, [[Ahilyabai Holkar|Ahalyabai's]] husband was killed. Her aged father-in-law ([[Malhar Rao Holkar|Malhar Rao]]) was shattered at the death of his son. He summoned Ahalyabai, who he loved deeply, and said: "You are now my son. I wish that you look after my kingdom".[[Malhar Rao Holkar]] died in 1766, 12 years after the death of his son Khande Rao. Malhar Rao's grandson and Khande Rao's only son [[Male Rao Holkar]] became the ruler of Indore in 1766, under Ahilya Bai's regency, but he too died within few months in April 1767. Ahilya Bai became the ruler of Indore after the death of her son with Khande Rao. [[Ahilyabai Holkar|Ahilya Bai]] was a great pioneer and builder of Hindu temples who constructed hundreds of temples and [[Dharamshala (type of building)|Dharmashalas]] throughout India. She is specially renowned for refurbishing and reconsecrating some of the most sacred sites of Hindu pilgrimage that had been desecrated and demolished in the previous century by the Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] including:

* [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] 
* [[Ayodhya]] – Construction of Shri Rama Temple, [[Sarayu River (Ayodhya)|Sarayu]] Ghat
* [[Badrinath Temple|Badrinath]] – Construction of Shri Kedareshwar Temple and Hari Temple, Dharamshalas (at Rangdachati, Bidarchati, Vyasaganga, [[Tungnath|Tunganath]], Pawali), construction of many kundas (at Gaurkund, Kundachatri), a garden and a kunda of warm water at [[Devprayag]], pastoral land for cows 
* [[Dwarka]] – Mohatajkhana, Pooja House and donation of some villages to the priests of the [[Dwarkadhish Temple]]
* [[Kedarnath Temple|Kedarnath]] – Dharmashala and Kund)
* [[Omkareshwar Temple|Omkareshwar]] – Renovation of the temples of Mamaleshwar Mahadev, Amaleshwar and Trambakeshwar Temples, completing the construction of Gauri-Somnath temple, construction of a Dharmashala & pond, donation of a silver mask for adoration of the [[Lingam|Shivalinga]] 
* [[Rameswaram]] – Construction of Hanumana Temple, Shri Radha Krishna Temple, a Dharmashala, Well & Garden and many more.

In 1818, the [[House of Holkar|Holkar]]s were defeated by the [[British Empire|British]] during the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], in the [[Battle of Mahidpur]] by which the capital was again moved from Maheshwar to Indore. A residency with British residents was established at Indore, but Holkars continued to rule [[Indore State]] as a [[princely state]] mainly due to efforts of their [[Dewan]] Tatya Jog. During that time, Indore has established the headquarters of the British Central Agency. [[Ujjain]] was originally the commercial centre of Malwa. But the British administrators such as [[John Malcolm]] decided to promote Indore as an alternative to Ujjain because the merchants of Ujjain had supported anti-British elements.<ref name="AF_1998">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAJDrdP6sikC&pg=PA63 |title=Smuggling as Subversion: Colonialism, Indian Merchants, and the Politics of Opium, 1790–1843 |first=Amar |last=Farooqui |publisher=Lexington |year=1998 |pages=62–63 |isbn=9780739108864 |access-date=25 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518084214/https://books.google.com/books?id=pAJDrdP6sikC&pg=PA63 |archive-date=18 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Post-independence ===

After India's independence in 1947, Holkar State, along with several neighbouring princely states, acceded to the Indian Union. On 1 November 1956, when [[Madhya Bharat]] was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]], Indore became part of the newly formed state. Indore a city today of nearly 4.5 million (2018) residents, has been transformed from a traditional commercial urban centre into the modern dynamic commercial capital of the state.

== Climate ==
Indore lies on a borderline between a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') and a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa''). Because of its high elevation and inland location even during the hottest months the nights are relatively cool, which is known as ''[[Shab-e-Malwa]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0RpUoGiou4C|title=Omkareshwar and Maheshwar: Travel Guide|date=2011|publisher=Goodearth Publications|isbn=9789380262246|page=79|access-date=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008231849/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_0RpUoGiou4C|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Three distinct seasons are observed: summer, monsoon and winter.
