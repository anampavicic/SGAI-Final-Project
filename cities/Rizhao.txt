'''Rizhao''' ({{zh|s=日照|t=日照|p=Rìzhào}}), [[Postal Map Romanization|alternatively romanized]] as '''Jihchao''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in southeastern [[Shandong]] [[province of China|province]], China. It is situated on the coastline along the [[Yellow Sea]], and features a major seaport, the [[Port of Rizhao]]. It borders [[Qingdao]] to the northeast, [[Weifang]] to the north, [[Linyi]] to the west and southwest, and faces [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] across the [[Yellow Sea]] to the east.

The name of the city literally means "sunshine".<ref name=Worldwatch>[[Worldwatch Institute]]. (2007). ''[[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]] : Our Urban Future.'' {{rp|108}}</ref> The city is known for its sustainability, and it mandates [[solar hot water|solar-water heaters]] in all new buildings. Rizhao city was recognized by the United Nations as one of the most [[UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award|habitable cities]] in the world in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |title=China coastal city wins UN Habitat award - China.org.cn |url=http://www.china.org.cn/environment/2009-10/06/content_18659059.htm |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=www.china.org.cn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Shandong Rizhao becomes the sixth city in China to win the UN Habitat Award |url=https://www.chinanews.com.cn/gn/news/2009/10-06/1898884.shtml |access-date=25 September 2022 |publisher=杨锈祯 党正林 |date=2009-10-06}}</ref>

The city population stands at 2,968,365 people as of the [[2020 Chinese census]], of whom 1,172,205 live in the urban area of [[Donggang District]]. Compared with the 2,801,013 people in [[2010 Chinese census]], there has been a total increase of 167,352 people in the past decade, an increase of 5.97%, with an average annual growth rate of 0.58%.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2021-06-18 |title=Heavyweight!

==History==
Rizhao is located at the place where the ancient [[Dawenkou culture]] and the [[Longshan culture]] flourished. Rizhao belonged to the [[Dongyi]] people during the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] and [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] dynasties (2070-1046 BC), and to [[Ju (state)|Ju]] and [[Yue (state)|Yue]] States in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770-476 BC) and the [[Warring States period]] (476-221 BC). It became a part of [[Langye Commandery]] in the [[Qin dynasty]] (221-206 BC). Rizhao was named Haiqu County ({{zh|labels=no|t=[[:zh:海曲县|海曲縣]]}}) during the [[Western Han]] (206 BC-25 AD) and Xihai County under the [[Eastern Han]] (25-220 AD).{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

During the [[Tang dynasty]], together with Ju County, Rizhao belonged to [[Mi Prefecture]] of Henan Prefecture. In the 10th century, Rizhao city and county was established, with the name meaning "(the first to get) sunshine". In 1940 it came under the control of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. After being a county and since 1985 a city under the administration of [[Linyi]], Rizhao became a prefecture-level city within Shandong province in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The Field Museum of Natural History in [[Chicago]] has done field survey archaeological work in Rizhao over the years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/expeditions/china6_expedition/about.html|title=Expeditions @ Field Museum - Feinman and Underhill - About the Expedition|website=archive.fieldmuseum.org}}</ref>

==Climate==
Rizhao has a temperate, four-season, [[monsoon]]-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') and [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (Köppen ''Dwa'') regimes. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of {{convert|-0.3|°C|1}}. Summer is generally hot and humid, but sweltering days are rare, with an August average of {{convert|25.7|°C|1}}. Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to much of the province. Conversely, fall is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The annual mean temperature is {{convert|12.95|°C|1}}. On average, there are 2,530 hours of bright sunshine annually, and the relative humidity is 70–74&nbsp;%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}
