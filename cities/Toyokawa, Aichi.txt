{{nihongo|'''Toyokawa'''|豊川市|Toyokawa-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in the eastern part of [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan. {{As of|2019|10|01}}, the city had an estimated population of 183,930 in 72,949 households,<ref>[https://www.city.toyokawa.lg.jp/ Toyokawa City official statistics] {{in lang|ja}}</ref> and a population density of 1,141 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. The total area of the city is {{convert|161.14|sqkm|sqmi}}. Toyokawa, famous for its [[Toyokawa Inari]] temple, has a good balance of industry, commerce, agriculture and forestry, and is situated in an area rich in history, traditions, and culture.

==Geography==
Located in the eastern part of Aichi Prefecture, the city has the Toyogawa River to the east, the Otoha River to the west, and the Sana River in the central area, flowing into Mikawa Bay in the southwest. The northern part of the city is predominantly mountainous, featuring numerous golf courses.

The city is divided into three districts covering 122.4 hectares in the central business area: the Suwa District, where public institutions and commercial facilities are located, the Toyogawa District, which developed as the gateway town to Toyogawa Inari Shrine, and the Chuo-dori District, connecting both areas. The city has implemented the "Basic Plan for Revitalization of the Central Business District," aiming to promote development in the central business district [4].

However, due to the merger of four villages that originally formed independent central areas, the city struggled to form a centralized urban center. Despite the expansive nature of the city's urban areas, the central functions are dispersed among several stations in different districts. Notably, Toyogawa Station, despite its name, does not function as the central station, further complicating the formation of a centralized business district. Consequently, large-scale commercial facilities and urban development lagged behind, leading to a prolonged situation where the purchasing population flowed to neighboring cities.

Entering the Heisei era, efforts were made to open medium-sized commercial facilities in the Suwa District and its vicinity. Simultaneously, roadside stores concentrated around Toyokawa IC and the southern part of Nagadoshi, near the border with Toyohashi City, without a clear shift in the decentralization trend.

Major roads, such as National Route 1 to the west, National Route 23 to the southwest, and National Route 151 from the east to the south, traverse the city. Additionally, the Hime Kaido (Hon-Zaka Street) runs east to west within the city. There are four railway lines, roughly parallel to the main roads.

In spring, cherry blossoms bloom along the Sana River, Otoha River, and in the Sakura Tunnel near the city hall, adding color to the streets. The summer season sees various festivals throughout the city, creating a lively atmosphere. The city enjoys a relatively mild climate, with little to no snowfall even in winter.

===Climate===
The city has a climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'').  The average annual temperature in Toyokawa is 15.8&nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall is 1751&nbsp;mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.5&nbsp;°C, and lowest in January, at around 4.8&nbsp;°C.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/asia/japan/aichi/toyokawa-4917/ Toyokawa climate data]</ref>

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data,<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/php/japan-aichi.php Toyokawa population statistics]</ref> the population of Toyokawa has been increasing over the past 60 years.

==History==
===Origins===
The area of modern Toyokawa was settled in prehistoric times. During the [[Nara period]], the [[provincial temple|kokubunji]] of [[Mikawa Province]] was established in 741.

===Feudal period===
====Muromachi period====
The temple of [[Toyokawa Inari]], a popular pilgrimage destination, dates from 1441.

====Sengoku period====
A number of ''[[daimyō]]'' clans under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] originate in what are now parts of Toyokawa, most notably the [[Makino clan]].

===Early modern period===
====Edo period====
The area prospered during the [[Edo period]] with two [[shukuba|post town]]s along the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]], [[Goyu-shuku]] and [[Akasaka-juku (Tōkaidō)|Akasaka]].

===Late modern period===
====Meiji period====
After the [[Meiji Restoration]], on October 1, 1889, several villages were organized with the establishment of the modern municipalities system within [[Hoi District, Aichi|Hoi District]], [[Aichi Prefecture]], including Toyokawa Village. 
On March 13, 1893, Toyokawa was promoted to town status.

====Showa period====
Toyokawa City was founded on June 1, 1943, by the merger of Toyokawa town with neighboring Ushikubo Town and Yawata Village, all from Hoi District.

In 1939 the massive [[Toyokawa Naval Arsenal]] was established, one of the largest producers of machine guns, aviation ordnance and ammunition in the [[Empire of Japan]].  
It also had sections that produced [[Guntō#Shin guntō (new military sword)|military-issue ''katana'']], [[bayonet]]s, and glass lenses for use in cameras, binoculars, and similar equipment. 
During [[World War II]], many thousands of civilians were conscripted or volunteered to work at the Arsenal, and towards the end of the war, this workforce included hundreds of middle school students and high school girls. 
On August 7, 1945, the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal was targeted by a flight of B-29 bombers.  
About 2,500 people were killed during the [[Bombing of Toyokawa in World War II |Toyokawa Air Raid]].

Toyokawa was one of the last places to be targeted using conventional explosive and incendiary bombs in the closing days of World War II, occurring the day after [[Hiroshima]] was destroyed by an atomic bomb.<ref>''Air War Pacific Chronology: America's Air War Against Japan in East Asia and the Pacific 1941–1945'' by Eric Hammel, (Pacifica, CA: Pacifica Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-935553-26-6}})</ref>

===Contemporary history===
====After WWII====
After the war, on April 12, 1955, Toyokawa annexed Mikami village from [[Yana District, Aichi|Yana District]]. This was followed by the neighboring town of Goyu from Hoi District on April 1, 1959. Toyokawa further expanded on February 1, 2006, by annexing [[Ichinomiya, Aichi (town)|Ichinomiya]], On January 15, 2008, the towns of [[Otowa, Aichi|Otowa]] and [[Mito, Aichi|Mito]] became part of Toyokawa, and finally on February 1, 2010, the town of [[Kozakai, Aichi|Kozakai]] likewise was merged into Toyokawa City.
