==Etymology==

Cabuyao was once the central part of "'''Tabuco'''", a large territory which once included the modern-day cities of San Pedro, Biñan, Santa Rosa and Calamba.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filipinoscribbles..wordpress.com/2010/08/02/tabuco-cabuyao-la-laguna/|title=Tabuco (Cabuyao, La Laguna)|last=Pepe|date=August 2, 2010|website=FILIPINO eSCRIBBLES|access-date=March 9, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The name "Cabuyao" came from the ''kabuyaw'' tree,   ''[[Kaffir lime|Citrus hystrix]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIp-mAEACAAJ|title=CRC World Dictionary of Medicinal and Poisonous Plants: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology.

After the colonization of [[Manila]] by [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] in 1570, he instructed Capt. [[Juan de Salcedo]] to conquer all ''[[Barangay (pre-colonial)|barangay]]s'' around the lake of Ba-i, which is now called [[Laguna de Bay]]. Just like the settlement of [[Bay, Laguna|Ba-i]], Tabuco had large plain area and rich forestry, and the climate was suited to farm crops. On January 16, 1571, it was announced by López de Legazpi that Tabuco be considered as ''[[encomienda]]'' or a town under Afirni Manlangit.

The town of Tabuco was located near the corner of a river and the lake of Ba-i which was made bancas or raft as the common means of transportation going to the town of Tabuco. There were many trees of [[Kaffir lime|kabuyaw]] growing around the area. The fruit of kabuyaw was used as shampoo. So, when the priest asked for the name of the place, the native women readily answered "'''kabuyaw'''", thinking that the priest was asking for the name of the trees growing around the wharf. From then on, the priests and other Spanish officials called the town of Tabuco as Cabuyao.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wowlaguna.com/towns-and-cities/cabuyao-laguna/ |title=WOWLaguna – Cabuyao History |access-date=July 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326070153/http://www.wowlaguna.com/towns-and-cities/cabuyao-laguna/ |archive-date=March 26, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-Spanish Era===
It was estimated that 300 years before the arrival of [[Catholicism]], [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] came yearly to the [[Philippines]]. These Malays were attracted to the progress of [[Manila|Maynila]] which was the center of commerce/trade by the natives coming around the lake of Ba-i which is known today as [[Laguna de Bay]]. This place was the exchanging point of commerce and trade between the natives and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Arab people|Arabs]] and other [[Malay race]]. These foreign traders established their respective villages around the lake of Ba-i.

One of the biggest villages established in the western portion of the lake was "Tabuko" or "Hangganang Ilog" which means boundary in the native tongue. The natives of this village came from [[Malay race]] of [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Indochina]]. Tabuko had no definite boundary except for natural landmarks such as the mountain, hills and lake. It can be said that the boundary of "Tabuko" reached the mountain range of Sungay at the west, Mt. Makiling at the south, the lake of Ba-i at the east and the large track of quicksand at Tunasan it the north.<ref name="CabuyaoHistory">[http://www.cabuyao.gov.ph/history/50-historyofcabuyao Cabuyao Official Website – History]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Spanish Era===
After the colonization of [[Manila]] by [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] in 1570, he instructed [[Juan de Salcedo|Captain Juan de Salcedo]] to conquer all settlements or barangays around the lake of Ba-i ([[Laguna de Bay]]). The first settlement conquered by Capt. Juan de Salcedo was on the eastern portion of the lake, known today as [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] and [[Cainta]] in the province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]]. Then, he crossed the lake of Ba-i and Acheron at Barangay Pinagsangahan, which is [[Pagsanjan, Laguna|Pagsanjan]] today, and continued inland and conquered other settlements, known today as [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]] and [[Majayjay, Laguna|Majayjay]]. Because the place was already mountainous, the party of Capt. Juan de Salcedo went back to the Lake of Ba-i and continued to conquer the settlements in the northern portion of Lake Ba-i, now called the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]]. In their journey, they anchored at the shore of Tabuko. Just like the settlement of Ba-i, Tabuko had large plain area and rich forestry and the climate was suited to farm crops. On January 16, 1571, it was announced by Miguel López de Legazpi that Tabuko be considered as "[[encomienda]]" or a town under Gaspar Ramirez. And that the settlement or barangay Malabanan, [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]] be under the administration of Tabuko government. This was the time that Tabuko had a definite boundary. The boundary at the north was Tunasan, south was Ba-i, west was Sungay and at the east was Lake Ba-i.

The town of Tabuko was located near the corner of a river and the lake of Ba-i which used bancas or raft as the common means of transportation going to Tabuko. When Franciscan priests came to Tabuko under Father Velin, there were many native females doing their laundry chore near the wharf where the boat of the Franciscan priests docked. There were many trees of "[[Kaffir lime|Kabuyaw]]", the fruit of which was used as shampoo, growing around the area. When the priest asked for the name of the place, the native females readily answered "Kabuyaw" thinking that the priest was asking for the name of the trees growing around the wharf. From then on, the priests and other Spanish officials called the town of Tabuko as Kabuyaw.

The Spaniards made Cabuyao as its center of government, which included the barangay of Malabanan, now the Cities of [[Biñan]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]] and [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]]. Because the barangays became haciendas of the friars, the barangay was separated from Cabuyao one by one.
The first to be separated was barangay Calamba that was hacienda de San Juan Bautista then. In 1689, barangay Malabanan was separated and became the town of [[Biñan]] (now a city). This was followed by barangay Santa Rosa de Lima.

On the summer of 1896, news spread over Cabuyao that the province of [[Cavite]] revolted against the Spanish government. Anticipating the disorder it will bring to the community, Lt. Isabelo Virtucio readily organized a volunteer group who will fight against the Spanish government. He coordinated with the different leaders of the revolutionary groups and his group joined the forces of [[Paciano Rizal|Gen. Paciano Rizal]], the brother of the Philippines' national hero, [[José Rizal|Jose Rizal]]. The group adopted [[guerrilla]] warfare in fighting the Spaniards such as ambush, surprise attack and putting up traps on the roads used by the enemy. It was almost two (2) years before the Spanish armed forces surrendered in 1898.<ref name="CabuyaoHistory"/>

===American Era===
It was not long before the residents of Cabuyao celebrated the independence of the [[Philippines]] from the Spanish government when the Americans arrived in 1899. They thought that the Americans were allies and friends but learned later that the Americans were the next conqueror of the Philippines.

Immediately, Captain Sotero Batallones organized a company of soldiers and fought the Americans who tried to conquer the town of Cabuyao. On their first encounter, many died on the side of Capt. Batallones' forces and they retreated on the mountain called Kay Sili (which is [[Barangay Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Casile]] today) at the western portion of the town of Cabuyao to prepare for another encounter. However, the Americans continued conquering other towns and established their headquarters at the convent of the church. The first American soldiers who arrived at Cabuyao were hostile to the residents of Cabuyao. They feared most one Lt. Robert who was fearsome, giving penalty to those who were suspected as rebels.

In the early years of American occupation of Cabuyao, peace and order became a problem because of the frequent robbery made by the former Filipino soldiers who refused to surrender to the American forces. There were leaders of the rebel groups hiding in the forested area of {{proper name|Puting}} Kahoy, Kasili at Mangumit like Casinto Perez, Macario Manguiat, Aniceto Oruga and others. Those who were suspected with association to these rebel leaders were arrested and tortured.

During the height of the campaign for peace and order of the American forces of Cabuyao, its parish priest, Fr. Eulalio Mea, was arrested and imprisoned because he was suspected that he had knowledge of the disorder happening in Cabuyao. The town justice at that time, Jose Batallones, who knew how to speak [[English language|English]] negotiated for the freedom of those who were not really involved.

The first town mayor of Cabuyao was Captain Sotero Batallones, who has previously peacefully surrendered to the Americans. But he was temporarily removed from office when she was suspected as part of the party that abducted Dominador Delfino and Jose Himedes, prominent residents of Cabuyao, in July 1904. Aniceto Oruga, believed to be the leader of the group, was a former companion of Captain Batallones. Luis Bella, the vice mayor at the time, was installed as the town mayor.

On August 29, 1904, Mr. Dominador Delfino and Jose Himedes were released from their captivity without any harm incurred on them. On September 7, 1904, Captain Batallones, reassumed his position as mayor of Cabuyao.

During his term as mayor of Cabuyao, he accomplished many development projects. He was instrumental in the construction of the school building at Bagong Kalsada, which is now Bonifacio Street. This building is now the Cabuyao Central School. On the same year, an artesian well was constructed at the town plaza and another at the new school site.

Agustin Dedicatoria replaced Sotero Battalones, as mayor of Cabuyao and served from 1913 to 1916. He was instrumental in the construction of the monument of [[José Rizal|Dr. Jose Rizal]] at the Cabuyao City Plaza and the establishment of the new municipal cemetery at the southwestern portions of the town somewhere the area of Puntod.

Jose Bella (1917–1919), who succeeded Agustin Dedicatoria, gave priority on the improvement of education and school buildings. He was also instrumental in the planting of mango trees around the Cabuyao Town Plaza and construction of school building at [[Barangay Mamatid, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Mamatid]] and [[Barangay Pulo, Cabuyao, Laguna|Pulo]].

In 1920, Exequiel Alipit was elected as mayor of Cabuyao but he was questioned because of his age. He was not of legal age when he was elected as required by law during that time. However, he served as mayor because he insisted that the people elected him to the position and not on the technicality of law. The case reached the Supreme Court which eventually decided on his disqualification from office. Manuel Basa, his vice mayor, replaced him. The case is included in the book of jurisprudence and is used as a reference in deciding cases of the same nature.
Mayor Exequiel Alipit was able to improve the drainage canal and road at [[Barangay Bigaa, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Bigaa]] using the 200 prisoners he requested from the Bureau of Prison.

The program of Januario Virtucio, who succeeded Alipit as mayor, centered on the construction of additional classrooms, improvement and construction of roads, and vaccination of all residents of Cabuyao.

Simeon Batallones was elected after Virtucio. He was commonly known as "Bargat" because he was brave enough to fight and control the cattle rustlers of the town. Like Mayor Alipit, he was not in good terms with the members of the municipal council and as such, he was not able to complete his term of office. Martin Alcasabas, his vice mayor, succeeded him.

Emilio Tanchico, who served from 1921 to 1931, was the first mayor elected from a poor family. He used his good public relations and intellect as assets to be elected as mayor. During his administration, he exerted efforts so that electricity can reach Cabuyao. He also prepared the site where the public market that had been located near the church was transferred, Camino Real, now called J.P. Rizal Avenue.

The next mayor, Dr. Alberto Carpena, was well loved by his townmates and became the only re-elected mayor of Cabuyao. His main thrust of government was community hygiene; free medical services were conducted. He was responsible for the construction of the Domestic Science Building located at the Central School of Cabuyao. He was also responsible for widening the road going to the public cemetery and other improvements at the public market such as construction of its concrete fence.

There were so many national events that happened during the term of Dr. Alberto Carpena who served from 1932 to 1936. It was during his term that the election for delegates to the Constitutional Assembly was held for the drafting of the Philippine Constitution (June 10, 1934). On December 14, 1935, women were given the right to vote ([[Women's suffrage]]). The event most remembered was the bloodiest encountered between the government ([[Constabulary]]) and the Sakdalistas of the town. It happened on May 2–3, 1935 at the town plaza and compound of the church.

The next elected Mayor of Cabuyao was Mayor Nicolas Limcaoco who served from 1937 to 1940. The original 3-year term was amended by the Constitution and made the new term of elected mayor to four (4) years. His accomplishments included the construction of road from Poblacion to [[Barangay Marinig, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Marinig]] which shortened the travel time going to the different barangays along the coastal area of the town, and the installation of water line from Matang Tubig at [[Barangay Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna|Casile]] to Poblacion. The project was completed in 1938 through the supervision of Jose L. Acuña who was elected as mayor in 1941.<ref name="CabuyaoHistory"/>

===Japanese Occupation===
On January 1, 1942, the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] arrived and conquered Cabuyao after they bombed [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]] on December 8, 1941. The first group of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] came from the battleground of [[Mauban, Quezon]]. This was followed by a great number of Japanese soldiers who proceeded to [[Manila]] and [[Bataan]] where a fierce battle was fought.

Because of the cruelty of the Japanese Imperial Army, the people of Cabuyao joined secret organizations known as "guerilla". The leaders of these groups were former [[USAFFE]]s who fought in [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor Island|Corregidor]]. There was the Markings Guerilla, [[Manuel L. Quezon|Pres. Manuel L. Quezon]]’s Own Guerilla (PQOC), Hunters ROTC, Straught Fil-American Troops, III Army Corps, FAIT, Ansay Suicide Regiment and La Fabella Regiment.

In Cabuyao, there was no direct military confrontation between the Japanese soldiers and Filipinos. Instead, it was between the [[Makapili]], a pro-Japanese group and the guerrillas. The known guerrilla leaders of Cabuyao were Col. Nicolas Soriano, Maj. Amado Garcia, Maj. Romulo Alcasabas, Maj. Raymundo Tanchico, Maj. Placido Aragon and Capt. Pablo Garcia to mention a few.<ref name="CabuyaoHistory"/>

===Liberation period===
On the morning of September 21, 1944, the people of Cabuyao were surprised to hear the sound of American airplanes going to [[Manila]] for bombing operations. It was on January 1, 1941, that American forces, part of the 7th Army Corps under Gen. Krueger, arrived at Cabuyao. The first group of American soldiers was led by Capt. Brown, who made their camp at the church compound (Patio).

Before the arrival of joint American and [[Philippine Commonwealth]] army soldiers to Cabuyao, the town was under the control of guerrilla under the leadership of Col. Nicolas Soriano. Thus, no military encounter occurred. The Americans readily established provisionary government called the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) where Mr. Enrique Hemedes was appointed as head. The office was responsible for the distribution of food and clothing to the needy people of Cabuyao but with priority to the evacuees coming from nearby towns.

When the arrival by the local Filipino troops of the 4th, 42nd and 47th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] in Cabuyao was taken from the town municipalities and aiding by the local guerrillas and the U.S. troops against the Japanese.

Mr. Emilio Tanchico replaced Mr. Enrique Hemedes. Mr. Tanchico was responsible for restoring the operations of the municipal government of Cabuyao such as the Office of the Treasurer, Office of Police, Postal Office and Communication and other offices. Mr. Nicolas Limcaoco then replaced him in the middle of 1946 and served until 1947.

The first thing Mr. Nicolas Limcaoco did was to establish peace and order in the locality. There were so many loose firearms because of the recent war, which led to robberies, theft, killing and other criminal offenses. He hired 10 "terong" (toughies) coming from the mountainous areas of Cabuyao and appointed them as policemen. Criminality was lessened and peace and order was maintained during that time in Cabuyao.<ref name="CabuyaoHistory"/>

===Post World War II===
When the [[Philippines]] gained its [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Independence]] on July 4, 1946, a presidential election preceded it where President [[Manuel Roxas]] was elected as the first president of the Third Republic. The president appointed Mr. Jose L. Acuña as mayor of Cabuyao.

Mayor Acuña restored the organizational set up of the Municipal Government of Cabuyao. He assisted the war veterans of Cabuyao in receiving their back pay, those whose properties were destroyed during the war in receiving war damage, and freed from jail people mistaken as [[Makapili]] or collaborators.

In 1947 local election, Mr. Lope B. Diamante was elected as mayor. Mayor Mauro H. Alimagno served for three terms: 1952–55, 1956–59 and 1960–63. Mr. Antonio Bailon served as mayor during the term 1964–67.

Mayor Alimagno again served during the period 1968–71, 1972–79 and 1980. However, he failed to complete his last term as mayor in 1980 as he was gunned down in [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]]. Vice Mayor Nicanor Alcasabas succeeded as mayor and served the remaining term. After the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], Mr. Isidro T. Hildawa was appointed mayor of Cabuyao. However, he was later appointed as member of the Provincial Board of Laguna, so it was Mr. Constancio G. Alimagno, Jr. who was appointed as mayor on April 1, 1986.

Mayor Proceso Aguillo was elected mayor of Cabuyao in the 1988 local election. Mayor Constancio G. Alimagno, Jr. served as mayor in 1992–95. Mayor Proceso Aguillo serves as mayor starting 1995 up to 2004. Mayor Nila G. Aguillo, wife of Proceso Aguillo, assumed office until 2007. Mayor Isidro Hemedes, Jr. a relative of then Mayor Enrique Hemedez, ascended into office from 2007 to 2016

What is common to these elected mayors is their concern for the general welfare of their constituents and the continuous implementation of programs, projects and activities towards the attainment of their objective of a peaceful and progressive place. The legacy left by these chief executives of the old town paved the road towards its transformation into the status of a component city, a status it currently enjoys.<ref name="CabuyaoHistory"/>

===Cityhood===
