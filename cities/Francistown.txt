'''Francistown''' is the [[List of cities in Botswana|second-largest city]] in [[Botswana]], with a population of about 103,417 and 147,122 inhabitants for its agglomeration at the 2022 census.<ref name=demo>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/images/stories/HouseHold/2006_bdsrprt.pdf|title=BOTSWANA DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEY 2006|author=Central Statistics Office|location=Gaborone, Botswana|access-date=25 July 2010|date=January 2009|archive-date=23 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923062237/http://www.cso.gov.bw/images/stories/HouseHold/2006_bdsrprt.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is located in eastern Botswana, about {{convert|400|km|mi}} north-northeast from the capital, [[Gaborone]]. Francistown is located at the confluence of the [[Tati River|Tati]] and Ntshe rivers, and near the [[Shashe River]] ([[tributary]] to the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]]) and {{convert|90|km|mi}} from the international border with [[Zimbabwe]]. 

Francistown was the centre of [[Southern Africa]]'s first [[gold rush]] and is still surrounded by old and abandoned [[mining|mines]]. The City of Francistown is an administrative district, separated from [[North-East District (Botswana)|North-East District]]. It is administered by Francistown City Council.<ref>[http://www.laws.gov.bw/ Laws of Botswana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723192435/http://www.laws.gov.bw/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, [http://www.mlg.gov.bw/ Ministry of Local Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718061659/http://www.mlg.gov.bw/ |date=18 July 2009 }}</ref> The main language spoken and used in and around Francistown is [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]].

{{Moresources|section|date=July 2023}}
Although evidence of habitation by humans goes back around 10,000 years, written evidence is more recent. Historical evidence shows that Francistown started off as one of the villages of the BaKalanga people which was best known for its mining. Mining which used to be a common activity and influence to the [[BaKalanga]]/Kalanga area of north-eastern [[Botswana]] was widely practiced in the area-mostly gold mining. Reportedly, [[Nyangabgwe]] was the nearest village to Francistown to have been visited by Europeans, when it was visited by the missionary, [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]]. Moffat was followed in 1867 by a gold prospector, [[Karl Mauch]] who found the Bakalanga mining gold along the [[Tati River]], and publicised the [[Tati Goldfields]] starting the first Southern Africa goldrush.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Eriksson |first1=Patrick G. |last2=Altermann |first2=W. |last3=Förtsch |first3=E. B. |year=1995 |title=Transvaal Sequence and Bushveld Complex |journal=Mineralium Deposita |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=85–88 |doi=10.1007/BF00189337|bibcode=1995MinDe..30...85E |s2cid=140649997 }}</ref>

The present town was founded in 1897 as a settlement near the Monarch mine and named after Daniel Francis, an [[English people|English]] prospector from [[Liverpool]] who acquired prospecting licences in the region in 1869.<ref> Fred Morton, Jeff Ramsay, Part Themba Mgadla, ''Historical Dictionary of Botswana'', Scarecrow Press, USA, 2008, pg. 120</ref> Francis was a director of the [[Tati Concessions Land]] (Tati Concessions Company), which acquired the land from [[Lobengula|King Lobengula]]. The centre of the new town was formed when the company sold off 300 lots in August of that year. The Monarch mine was not the only mine in operation at that time, and it was widely believed that Francistown would grow rapidly. In the beginning, the town comprised one street east of, and parallel to the railway line. This street featured several companies, including two hotels (the Grand and the Tati), retail and wholesale shops, and three banks.

Prior to independence Francistown was Botswana's largest commercial centre. In 1897, the company sold part of the land for residential and commercial purposes. The city started as a gold mining town, and gold sustained the area's economy from the late 1800s until the 1930s. When gold was discovered nearby in 1869 it sparked the first gold rush in [[Africa]] fifteen years before the gold boom at [[Witwatersrand]] in [[South Africa]]. The industry was hard hit by the global recession of the 1930s. Between 1936 and 1980s, the economy of Francistown was largely supported or dependent on the [[Witwatersrand Native Labour Association]], a company that recruited labour for South African mines. The miners were recruited from many African countries, and transported to South Africa through Francistown by air or railway.

Haskins Street (named after a prominent family in the town prior to independence) was the first tarred road in Botswana. Since 1966, the city has grown significantly due mainly to active cross-border trading with Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. In 1997, Francistown became a city, Botswana's 2nd after Gaborone. With the city located astride Botswana's main road and rail transport routes, mining, commerce and agriculture have been essential parts of its economy. Tati Nickel, The Dumela Industrial Complex and [[Botswana Meat Commission]] are the main economic drivers in the city. Both government departments and private benefit the local economy.

==Economy==

===Mining===
Francistown is located on Botswana's main air and road transport routes; [[mining]] and [[agriculture]] are important. Principal mining companies include [[Tati Nickel]], owned by [[Norilsk Nickel]], which has operations at the Selkirk and Phoenix mines, producing principally [[cobalt]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Norilsk Nickel|url=http://www.nornik.ru/en/our_products/norilsknickelafrica/|access-date=25 July 2010}}</ref> The Dumela Industrial Complex, an [[industrial park]], is an important employer; the Botswana Metal Refinery was being built in 2008 near the city. However, the project was halted due to high costs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gabathuse|first=Ryder|title=P3bn Tati project crashes|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=32&dir=2008/June/Friday6|publisher=Mmegi|access-date=25 July 2010|location=Francistown, Botswana|date=6 June 2008}}</ref>

===Media===

The city's media fraternity is still in its infancy. The media includes Botswana's ''[[The Voice (Botswana)|The Voice]]'' newspaper, which was founded in 1993. This is a very popular [[tabloid newspaper]] that had also spread its wings to the capital city, [[Gaborone]].

== Climate ==

Francistown features a hot [[semi-arid climate]], with warm to hot summers and mild winters. The city on averages sees {{convert|460|mm}} of precipitation annually. The city features a short [[wet season]] that spans from December through March and a lengthy [[dry season]] that covers the remaining eight months. Francistown receives on average only {{convert|3|mm}} of precipitation at the peak of its dry season (from June through August), which is also when it experiences its chilliest temperatures. Average low temperatures routinely fall below {{convert|8|C}} during the aforementioned months. The record high temperature registered in Francistown was {{convert|41.1|°C}} and the lowest temperature recorded was {{convert|-6.5|°C}}.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203143334/http://www.weather.info.bw/resources/entry_fs.html |archive-date=3 December 2008 |url=http://www.weather.info.bw/resources/entry_fs.html |title=Botswana's Climate |publisher=Meteorological Services Botswana |access-date=15 July 2021}}</ref>

==Demographics and health==

Ever since the founding of Francistown as a gold mining and railway centre in the nineteenth century, the city's population has consistently shown a steady increase. Francistown is Botswana's second largest city with 22.7% of the country's urban population in 1991. The growth of [[Selebi-Phikwe]], [[Orapa]] and [[Jwaneng]] since 1971, together with the very rapid growth of Gaborone, has reduced Francistown's share of the total urban population from a figure of 34.7% in 1971. In the same period (1971-1991), the country's urban population grew by 427.2% from 54,411 to a population of 287,063.

The [[Bakalanga]], the second largest [[ethnic group]] in [[Botswana]] are traditionally centred around the town and the surrounding area. Recently, the city has seen a large influx of [[illegal immigrant]]s from neighbouring [[Zimbabwe]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gabathuse|first=Ryder|title=Security operation starts in Francistown|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/2006/March/Tuesday28/174601131162.html|publisher=Mmegi|access-date=2010-07-26|location=Francistown, Botswana|date=2006-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pacione|first=Michael|title=Applied Geography: Principles and Practice : an Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental and Human Geography|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-21419-3}}</ref>

==Culture==
Francistown is home to the [[Supa Ngwao Museum]], with exhibits related to the area's history and heritage.  The museum, which receives most of its funds from the government, is currently going through refurbishment as of October 2011.  A new nature reserve, [[Tachila]], has been established {{convert|5|km|mi}} from central Francistown on an old Tati Company Farm, Lady Mary.  The nature reserve is expected to be a tourism turn-over for the already flourishing city with its variety of wild animals.

== Places of worship ==
{{See also|Religion in Botswana}}
Among the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Botswana]] ([[Lutheran World Federation]]), [[Assemblies of God]], [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[International Pentecostal Holiness Church]], [[Christ Embassy]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Francistown]] ([[Catholic Church]]).<ref> J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 380</ref>

==Education==
{{Main article| Education in Botswana}}
{{Moresources|section|date=July 2023}}
The city has primary schools on almost all its townships, most if not all of which are run by the city council. Notable amongst these are Ikhutseng Primary School, Tati Town Primary School and Nyangabgwe Primary School, which are one of the oldest in the city. There is also Aerodrome Primary School. The government also has junior high schools, trading as "secondary schools". Most of these were started as partnerships between government and society. It was only recently that the government took most of these over. Examples of these include Setlalekgosi, Montsamaisa and Selepa Junior Secondary Schools. These offer the best education at JC level and have a three-year course.

There are private schools in the city as well, among others the historic and famous John Mackenzie School, which offers primary, junior secondary as well as senior secondary education. The school also offers O-Levels for students who have pursued the IGCS Examination. There is also Mophato English Medium School, TKM, Clifton Preparatory School and many more other smaller private schools.

There are currently two senior secondary schools in Francistown, being Mater Spei College, partly ran by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Francistown Senior Secondary School]], opened in 1978 and currently enrolling 1200 students. Located in the history-rich township of Aerodrome, it is one of the largest institutions in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief history of our School|url=http://www.info.bw/~fsss/history.htm|access-date=2010-07-26|author=Francistown Senior Secondary School|author-link=Francistown Senior Secondary School|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012173317/http://www.info.bw/~fsss/history.htm|archive-date=12 October 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>
The Francistown Teacher Training College became one of the campuses of the [[University of Botswana]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.ub.bw/about.cfm?pid=447&m=206|access-date=26 July 2010|author=University of Botswana|author-link=University of Botswana}}</ref> 

The Francistown College of Technical and Vocational Education was officially opened by former president of Botswana [[Ian Khama]] on 10 October 2008. The college was built in order to accommodate 1,500 learners on technical and vocational courses and teacher-training programmes. The college buildings are situated amongst a {{convert|4|ha|acre|adj=on}} area in the suburbs of Gerald Estates. The city also hosts the Institute of Health Sciences, which is located near the Nyangabwe Referral Hospital. The institution, amongst others, offers courses in nursing and health care.

==Transport and infrastructure==

[[File:Photo Submission by Aone Mokwena (4).jpg|thumb|Francistown City Bus and Taxi Rank]]
The city is a major transport hub. A railway line links the city with [[Harare]] in [[Zimbabwe]] via [[Bulawayo]]. The same line links Francistown with the capital city [[Gaborone]] and [[Lobatse]] in the south. Surfaced roads link the city to [[Ramokgwebana]] in the north, and to [[Kazungula]] as well as [[Kasane]] via [[Nata, Botswana|Nata]].

The city is served by [[Francistown International Airport]], who was opened on 9 September 2011 after being built at a cost of P596 million, officially opened by Minister of Transport, [[Frank Ramsden]]. With a terminal building designated for traffic forecast of up to 2025, it has a larger capacity and has replaced the old airport, which is now used by the [[Botswana Defence Force]]'s Air Arm.

== Sports ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2024}}
[[File:Francistown Stadium Botswana.jpg|thumb|[[Francistown Stadium]]]]
Based at the Francistown Club, the Francistown School of Tennis is a professional tennis centre dedicated to developing young children (starting at 4 years old) into international tennis players.

Francistown also hosts several football clubs. These include [[TAFIC Sporting Club]], TASC FC (Tati Sporting Club),<ref>{{cite web |title=TASC FC - Soccer |url=https://globalsportsarchive.com/team/soccer/tasc-fc/16973/ |website=globalsportsarchive.com |publisher=Global Sports Archive |access-date=8 March 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=TASC FC :: Botswana |url=https://www.playmakerstats.com/team/tasc-fc/23913 |website=www.playmakerstats.com |access-date=8 March 2024}}</ref> [[ECCO City Greens FC]], [[Great North Tigers FC]] (GNT) and others.

All the teams have played in the country's highest league, [[Botswana Premier League]], sponsored currently by [[BTC Mobile]]. GNT was recently promoted to the Premier League, while TAFIC play in the lower division. The new [[Francistown Stadium]] is still under construction, and will be complete soon.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The stadium will be the largest in the northern part of Botswana, with a capacity of 27,000 spectators, and will be home ground to some of the above teams. Other stadiums in the city include the [[Francistown City Council]]'s Area S stadium.
