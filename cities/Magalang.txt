'''Magalang''', officially the '''Municipality of Magalang''' ({{lang-pam|Balen ning Magalang}}; {{lang-tl|Bayan ng Magalang}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pampanga]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 124,188 people.{{PH census|current}}

==History==
Magalang was mentioned as a ''visita'' to the nearby town of [[Arayat, Pampanga|Arayat]] on December 29, 1598. On April 30, 1605, it was separated by the [[Augustinians]] from Arayat and attained township status due to the ''bajo de la campana'' system. The Augustinians appointed Fr. Gonzalo de Salazar, OSA as the first pastor.

Magalang was initially called ''Magalo'', derived from the Kapampangan word "Galo", which means wavy and moving, describing the dangerous flow of the Parua River.

The town proper was located in Macapsa, but due to the natural calamities and revolts led by Andres Malong and his subordinate Melchor de Vera against the Spanish in 1660, it was nearly abandoned. It was moved to San Bartolome in 1734 until it was swept by the flood due to the overflow of the Parua River in 1863. It was transferred to the present site in barrio San Pedro Talimunduc on December 13, 1863, led by the parish priest, Fr. Ignacio Manzanares, OSA and some of the members of ''principalia'' including Pablo M. Luciano, ''gobernadorcillo'' of Magalang at that time.

In 1885, the agricultural experiment station ''La Granja Modelo de Luzon'' was transferred from [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]], [[Nueva Ecija]] to the foothills of [[Mount Arayat]], which became the present [[Pampanga State Agricultural University]].

The revolutionary government took over the local government on June 12, 1898, led by General [[Francisco Macabulos]] and Colonel Lorenzo D. Camaya. During that time, Magalang was one of the revolutionary centers in Pampanga due to its proximity to Camansi, a revolutionary headquarters located in Mount Arayat. The forces of Major General [[Servillano Aquino]] defended Magalang against the Americans until it was successfully captured on November 5, 1899, led by Major General [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]] and Colonel [[Jacob H. Smith]]. 

During the Second World War, Japanese forces defeated the Filipino-American forces composed of [[Igorot]] troops led by Major Helmert Duisterhof and Capt. [[Russell W. Volckmann]], paving the way for the capture of Magalang on January 1, 1942. It was liberated by the [[148th Infantry]] of [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Division]], US Army with the help of [[Hukbalahap]] on January 25, 1945. It was one of the hotbeds of the [[Hukbalahap]] insurgency until the rebellion was crushed in 1954.

On December 28, 1963, Mayor Benedicto T. Dayrit was assassinated by the alleged men of Commander Sumulong during a night ball in the town plaza. In 1968, Mayor Daniel T. Lacson was sworn in as mayor of Magalang until his term ended in 1986.

In December 1993, Mayor Daniel Lacson Jr. was briefly replaced by his political rival Elpidio Lakandula when the latter was declared the victor in the 1992 election by the [[Angeles City]] Regional Trial Court on December 28, which was immediately met with protests by Lacson and his followers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burgos|first=Roberto|title=More cops deployed to avert violence|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SJcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CwsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4594%2C1807011|access-date=December 26, 2021|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=January 13, 1994|page=4|quote=Lakandula immediately took over the municipal hall, prompting Mayor Lacson and his supporters to stage protest actions that threatened peace and order in the town.}}</ref>

During the tenure of Mayor Pastor Z. Guiao, Magalang was named one of the cleanest municipalities in the Philippines. Mayor Maria Lourdes P. Lacson was sworn in on June 30, 2016, as the first woman mayor of Magalang.<ref>Bartolo, Louie Aldrin and Dizon, Lino.(2016) ''The Magalang Book: The Historical Life and Culture of a Kapampangan Town (1605-2015)''. National Commission for Culture and the Arts.</ref>

The [[National Museum of the Philippines]] declared on December 23, 2015, the "Magalang Municipal Hall" as an [[Important Cultural Property (Philippines)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/2015/12/25/1536223/national-museum-bares-2015-list-cultural-treasures-properties | title=National Museum bares 2015 list of cultural treasures, properties |first=Alexandra|last=Villa|website=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=December 25, 2015 }}</ref>

=== Heliograph Towers ===
On August 21, 2017, the “[[Heliograph]] Towers” inside the premises of Cariyana Monastery in Barangays San Isidro and Santa Cruz were declared as [[Important Cultural Property (Philippines)]] of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] per Resolution 14-2016. They were officially turned over by the National Museum of the Philippines to the local government unit on May 27, 2021. The "Torre" was called "imburnal", “bornal” or “batiawan” as smoke outlets for “cabiawan” or [[trapiche]] of early carabao-driven sugar mills. These solar-sun telegraphs are made of fine laryu (red [[brick]]s) and huge cut stones of [[pumice|pumiceous rocks]] and [[Pyroclastic rock|volcanic tuff]]. They were used as “sun writers” (mirrored communications devices for sending messages in [[Morse code]] by flashing the reflected sun's rays to a distant station). 

The 1896 description states:  “An instrument called the heliograph, or sun telegraph, constructed with small mirrors made to turn upon both a horizontal and vertical axis, mounted upon a tripod, so arranged as to make the flashes appear and disappear in rapid succession, is to a limited extent in use in the army; and by it, messages may be transmitted much faster than with flags or torches, and it can be used at longer ranges.  It is manipulated by a key similar to the electric telegraph instrument.  Mirror signaling was first used by the North American Indians.”<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://businessmirror.com.ph/2017/03/05/pampanga-town-promotes-historical-structures/| title=Pampanga town promotes historical structures|first=Joey |last=Pavia|website=[[BusinessMirror]]|date=March 5, 2017 }}</ref>

Erected by General Don [[Battle of Aliaga|Ricardo Monet]] y Carretero, a Commandant of War  in 1863, the Towers were used by the Spanish army as stations of communication for faster transmission of messages and signals and to destroy the revolutionary forces in Camansi in Mount Arayat led by General [[Francisco Macabulos]]. In a letter dated May 8, 1898, Monet informed the Comandancia General del Centro de Luzon of the destruction of activities of the detachment of Camansi located at [[Mount Arayat]], transforming it into a [[Blockhouse|blok-haus]] constructed at Magalang with some torre heliografico located in the 10 towns of Magalang and [[Concepcion, Tarlac]] with a height of 20 meters and made under the charge of the Engineering Corps. Originally, three "batiauan" or [[watchtower]]s were built but only two existed (Santa Cruz and San Isidro) and were also used to watch the coming of the enemies. Later the towers once produced [[muscovado]] sugar and  [[Panela|panotsa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/feature/magalangs-commitment-to-cultural-preservation| title= Magalang's commitment to cultural preservation|first=Charlene|last=Cayabyab|website=[[SunStar]]|date=May 31, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.sunstar.com.ph/more-articles/magalang-heliograph-towers-declared-cultural-properties| title= Magalang Heliograph Towers declared ‘cultural properties’|first=|last=|website=[[SunStar]]|date= August 22, 2017 }}</ref>
