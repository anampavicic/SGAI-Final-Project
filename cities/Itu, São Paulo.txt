Itu was the birthplace of nationally-known comedian Simplicio, whose catchphrase was "back home in Itu everything is bigger". This led to the city becoming known as the "capital of large things", with a number of oversized objects being constructed there. The town's "exaggerations" include a 4m tall yellow pay phone called "orelhão", an oversized street light, a giant car tire (which was set on fire) and a mast decorated with a star, claimed to be the world's tallest artificial Christmas tree.<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite news | title=Small Town In Brazil Cultivates Big Image | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=3 December 2000 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/12/03/small-town-in-brazil-cultivates-big-image/df9436f8-60bf-471a-82f0-8c473865bf2d/?noredirect=on}}</ref>
