Uvira is characterized by the presence of several [[river]]s and is rich in [[stream]]s. The city is dominated by [[Lake Tanganyika]], which borders it from the northeast and southeast. From the west, Uvira is crossed by various rivers, namely the Kamberulu River, [[Ruzizi River]], Kakungwe River, Kibinda River, Kamanyola River, Kalimabenge River, Mulongwe River, and Kanvinvira River. The presence of Lake Tanganyika significantly influences the [[climate]] and [[weather patterns]] in the region, as large [[Body of water|bodies of water]] have an impact on local [[temperature]]s and [[precipitation]].<ref name="memoireonline.com">{{Cite web |last=Kabulimbo |first=Ange Mariamu |date=2010 |title=La problématique des accusations des viols et violences sexuelles en territoire d'Uvira.

The city experiences a tropical climate with a clear division between [[Wet season|wet]] and [[Dry season|dry seasons]]. The wet season in Uvira typically occurs from January to mid-May and from mid-September to December, and a dry season spanning from June to September.<ref name="memoireonline.com" /> Temperature variations align with the seasons and elevation, with lower temperatures in the high plateau (15° to 25°C) and moderate temperatures (20° to 30°C) in the Ruzizi Plain during the dry season.<ref name="memoireonline.com" />

=== Administrative divisions ===
Uvira's administrative framework is rooted in its historical development since 1911, molded by its strategic role.<ref name=":5" /> On 17 October 1900, the [[Congo Free State]]—under the rule of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]]—established a [[Council of war|war council]] in Uvira to facilitate the conquest and administration of the [[Kivu]] region.<ref name=":5" /> Uvira's pivotal location at the northern entry to Kivu allowed for monitoring [[German East Africa]] positions in neighboring [[Ruanda-Urundi]] and Tanganyika.<ref name=":5" /> In 1908, King Leopold II ceded the Congo Free State to [[Belgium]], transitioning the territory into what would become the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name=":5" />[[File:Uvira, South Kivu, DR Congo (DRC).jpg|thumb|Uvira in February 2023|196x196px]]A central administrative shift occurred on 11 September 1911, when a ministerial decree formally annexed Kivu to the [[Stanleyville District]] (later part of the [[Orientale Province]] of the Belgian Congo) and designating Uvira as the district headquarters.<ref name=":5" /> This administrative body included three sectors—[[Tanganika District|Tanganyika]], Edward, and Rutshuru—with Uvira, [[Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Beni]], and [[Rutshuru]] serving as the sector capitals.<ref name=":5" /> In 1914, however, Kivu's capital was transferred from Uvira to Rutshuru.<ref name=":5" /> Uvira's administrative structure was further refined in 1928 with the establishment of [[Uvira Territory]], organized into three chiefdoms: [[Bafuliiru Chiefdom|Bafuliru]], Bavira, and Barundi.<ref name=":5" /> Ordinance-Law No. 21/91, issued on 25 February 1938, defined Uvira Territory's boundaries and administrative structure, which included three chiefdoms ([[Bafuliiru Chiefdom|Bafuliiru]], Bavira, and the Ruzizi Plain), three urban centers (Uvira, [[Kiliba]], and [[Sange, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Sange]]), and three administrative posts (Makobola, [[Luvungi]], and [[Mulenge]]).<ref name=":5" /> This administrative configuration remained unaltered by Order No. 67-221, issued on 3 May 1967.<ref name=":5" />

=== Early history ===
[[File:Immigration des Bavira au cours des siècles.jpg|thumb|The migratory dispersions undertaken by the [[Vira people|Bavira]] prior to their eventual settlement in the [[Uvira Territory]].|196x196px]]
Uvira has a long and intricate history influenced by the convergence of different ethnic groups over time. According to early accounts by [[Alfred Moeller de Laddersous]], the region's initial inhabitants were [[Zyoba people|Bazoba]], a community of fishermen along [[Lake Tanganyika]]'s shores.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moeller |first=Alfred |url=https://www.congoforum.be/Upldocs/1_pdfsam_Moeller%201936%20Migrations%20dans%20la%20PO.compressed.pdf |title=Les grandes lignes des migrations des Bantus de la province orientale du Congo Belge |publisher=G. van Campenhout |year=1936 |location=Belgium |pages=136 |language=French}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Sebakunzi |first=Ntibibuka |date=January 1998 |title=Le rôle du site dans l'extension de la cité d'Uvira |trans-title=The role of the site in the expansion of the city of Uvira |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/payen_0989-6007_1990_act_3_1_866 |access-date=10 June 2023 |website=[[Persée (web portal)|Persée]] |language=French |publication-place=Lyon, France}}</ref> The region was subsequently occupied by the Banyalenge (or ''Benelenge''), immigrants who derived their name from their chief, Lenge, who likely migrated from [[Maniema]] around the 17th century.<ref name=":1" /> Over time, the Banyalenge became known as the [[Vira people|Bavira]] and emerged as the ruling clan of the ethnic group.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":02">{{Cite web |date=2004 |title=Rapport final des consultations participatives de la base pour l'élaboration du Document de Stratégies de Réduction de la Pauvreté (DSRP): Territoire de UVIRA - Province du Sud Kivu. |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/4917/4024.pdf?sequence=1 |access-date=24 June 2023 |website=University of Texas Libraries |pages=14–16 |language=fr |publication-place=Austin, Texas}}</ref> The name "''Bavira''" is derived from "''Kivira''", meaning "[[Elaeis|oil palm]]" in the local language, a reference to the palm-rich landscape that led neighboring communities to associate the people with the "land of oil palms".<ref name=":1" />

Following the Vira settlement, the Bahamba clan of the [[Furiiru people|Fuliiru people]] arrived in the region, establishing themselves north of the Bavira, partly within Bavira territory. Notably, the Bahamba clan had their own paramount leader who operated independently from the Bavira paramount. Gradually, the Bahamba clan expanded their paramountcy, occupying considerable localities along the north-western coastline of the [[Ruzizi Plain]], stretching from Uvira to [[Luvungi]]. The expansion led to the establishment of the Bahamba dynasty, which governed the various parts of the region. [[Endogamy|Inter-marriage]] between the Bavira and Bafuliiru clans occurred, which further intertwined their cultures and forged [[Social connection|social connections]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chubaka |first=Bishikwabo |date=1987 |title=Aux Origines De La Ville D'uvira Selon Les Explorateurs Et Les Pionniers De La Colonisation Belge Au Zaire (1840-1914) |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41968746 |journal=Civilisations |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=83–126 |jstor=41968746 |issn=0009-8140}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIhyAAAAMAAJ&q=Dynastie%20Bahamba |title=Culture et société, Volume 4 |publisher=Ministère de la Jeunesse, des Sports et de la Culture, Centre de Civilisation Burundaise |year=1981 |pages=108–120 |language=French}}</ref>

=== Later history ===

==== European explorers ====
[[File:Uvira fort.jpg|thumb|246x246px|Uvira fortress entrance, [[Belgian Congo]], 1910s]]
Throughout the 19th century, several [[Europe]]an explorers carried out expeditions to Uvira. In 1857–1858, Richard Francis Burton and [[John Hanning Speke]] embarked on a mission that brought them to [[Lake Tanganyika]], while in 1871, [[Henry Morton Stanley]] joined [[David Livingstone]] at [[Ujiji]], a town situated in the [[Kigoma-Ujiji District]] of the [[Kigoma Region]], where they explored the mouth of the [[Ruzizi River]]. However, it was in 1898 that Lieutenant Chargeois established a post in Uvira opposite the one the [[German East Africa|Germans]] had established in [[Bujumbura]], a year earlier in 1897. He was immediately joined by Catholic missionaries, notably the [[Victor Roelens|Reverend Father Victor Roelens]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Burton |first=Sir Richard Francis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4BxDQAAQBAJ&dq=Richard+Francis+Burton+Uvira&pg=PT1537 |title=Delphi Collected Works of Sir Richard Francis Burton (Illustrated) |date=6 November 2016 |publisher=Delphi Classics |isbn=9781786560551 |location=East Sussex, United Kingdom |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Swayne |first1=George Carless |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucENAAAAQAAJ |title=Lake Victoria: A Narrative of Explorations in Search of the Source of the Nile |last2=Speke |first2=John Hanning |publisher=W.

==== Barundi and Banyarwanda immigration ====
The region experienced an influx of Barundi and Banyarwanda immigrants In the latter half of the 19th century. The Barundi immigrants were predominantly Tutsis, accompanied by a smaller number of Hutus who were harbored in [[Ruzizi Plain]] by Bafuliiru. They were later dispersed to various localities in Uvira.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyF9DAAAQBAJ |title=Natural Resources and Local Livelihoods in the Great Lakes Region of Africa: A Political Economy Perspective |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |date=March 23, 2011 |isbn=9780230304994 |editor-last=Ansoms |editor-first=A. |location=London, United Kingdom |pages=38 |language=English |editor-last2=Marysse |editor-first2=S.}}</ref> Conversely, the majority of Banyarwanda immigrants were mostly Tutsi herders who were accommodated by Fuliiru chief in [[Mulenge]] and [[Sange, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Upper Sange]], incrementally establishing their presence.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Depelchin |first=jacques |title=From Pre-capitalism to Imperialism: A History of Social and Economic Formations in Eastern Zaire (Uvira Zone, C. 1800-1965). |publisher=Stanford University |year=1974 |location=Stanford, California |pages=80–90 |language=English}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Pottier |first=Johan |date=September 26, 2002 |title=Re-Imagining Rwanda: Conflict, Survival and Disinformation in the Late Twentieth Century |url=https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/106/422/170/195232 |access-date=2023-06-10 |website=academic.oup.com |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=16 |language=English |publication-place=Cambridge, United Kingdom}}</ref> During the [[Rwandan Revolution]] and the [[Rwandan genocide]], a significant number of refugees settled in various regions of Uvira.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kapapi |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4qdDwAAQBAJ&dq=banyarwanda+in+lemera,+mulenge,+katobo&pg=PT171 |title=Lies of the Tutsi in Eastern Congo/Zaire: A Case Study: South Kivu (Pre-Colonial to 2018) |date=28 March 2019 |isbn=9781796022896 |location=Bloomington, Indiana |pages=14–15 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Namujimbo |first=Déo |title=Je reviens de l'enfer: Reportage de guerre à l'est de la RD Congo - (août-septembre 1998) |publisher=Éditions L'Harmattan |date=August 2014 |isbn=9782336353289 |location=Paris, France |pages=14 |language=French}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Rever |first=Judi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9LMDwAAQBAJ |title=In Praise of Blood: The Crimes of the Rwandan Patriotic Front |date=18 February 2020 |publisher=Random House of Canada |isbn=9780345812100 |location=Toronto, Ontario |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Binet |first=Laurence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUcuDAAAQBAJ |title=Rwandan Refugee Camps in Zaire and Tanzania 1994-1995 |date=18 May 2016 |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières |location=Paris, France |language=English}}</ref>

==== Arab-Swahili slave trade ====
{{See also|Congo Arab war}}Between the 1850s and 1890s, Burundi's shoreline served as an [[entrepôt]] for the slave traffic coming from the eastern part of the [[Congo Free State]]. [[Swahili people|Arab-Swahili]] merchants, who were majorly warlords involved in the [[Indian Ocean slave trade]], procured slaves from the area for the purpose of trading. They operated mainly in the eastern [[Congo Free State]], notably in areas like Uvira, [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], [[Nyangwe]], [[Kasaï (former province)|Kasaï]], [[Kabinda Territory|Kabinda]], [[Kirundu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Kirundu]], and [[Baraka, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baraka]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Leadership in Eastern Africa: Six Political Biographies |publisher=Boston University Press |year=1968 |editor-last=Bennett |editor-first=Norman Robert |location=Boston, Massachusetts |pages=154 |language=English}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Burton |first=Sir Richard Francis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4BxDQAAQBAJ&dq=Richard+Burton+SLAVES+IN+uVIRA&pg=PT1512 |title=Delphi Collected Works of Sir Richard Francis Burton (Illustrated) |publisher=Delphi Classics |date=November 6, 2016 |isbn=9781786560551 |location=East Sussex, United Kingdom |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Burton |first=Sir Richard Francis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMwcAAAAMAAJ&dq=Richard+Burton+SLAVES+uVIRA+ivory&pg=PA340 |title=The Lake Regions of Central Africa: A Picture of Exploration · Volume 2 |publisher=Harper & brothers |year=1860 |location=Manhattan, New York, NY |pages=340 |language=English}}</ref>   
[[File:Nyangwe.jpg|left|thumb|252x252px|Three men of Dugumbé ben Habib raiding the market of [[Nyangwe]], July 15th, 1871]]
Father Van der Burgt noted in his ''Dictionary'' that in 1897–8, there were a few discreet slave dealers in Uzige (in the region of [[Bujumbura|Usumbura]]), Bangwana (Islamized people from [[Unyamwezi]] or the [[Congo Basin|Congo basin]]), Basumbwa, Bavira (from the country of Uvira), and Bayangayanga (peddlers from the southern part of Burundi, specialized in the trade of [[salt]] and [[iron]]).<ref name=":1" /> He added that a boy was worth two to four ''fundo'' or strings of beads, while a girl was worth twice as much (a ''fundo'' was valued at 0.30F at that time).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Depelchin |first=Jacques |title=From Pre-capitalism to Imperialism: A History of Social and Economic Formations in Eastern Zaire |publisher=Stanford University |year=1974 |location=Stanford, California, United States |pages=166–170 |language=English}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> In Uvira, Arab-Swahili traders established commercial networks and often collaborated with local [[Intermediary|intermediaries]] to capture, enslave, and transport people. The native population also engaged in trade, exchanging [[Slavery|slaves]], [[ivory]], [[iron]] [[Object (philosophy)|objects]], [[Barkcloth|bark clothing]], [[palm oil]], [[banana]]s, [[grain]], and [[cassava]], which led to the development of a significant commercial center that traded products from all the interlacustrine kingdoms and chiefdoms.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />



According to [[Richard Francis Burton]]:<blockquote>"The Uvira trade is important, the place is very busy because of the abundance and the low price of food: it is a large warehouse of slaves, ivory, clothing of bark and iron objects of the northern region of the lake, and in the travel season, it is rare that a day passes without several canoes coming there to fetch goods and food. Rice is not grown there, but sorghum and maize are bought there".<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>Following the [[Congo Arab war|Congo-Arab War]], the [[Slave Trade|slave trade]] began to decline. While the war did not entirely eradicate the slave trade, it significantly contributed to its decline. The conflict disrupted the existing networks and operations of Arab-Swahili slave traders, making it considerably more challenging for them to continue their slave-trading activities as before. Furthermore, with the arrival of the [[Force Publique]], the Belgian colonial forces in the region, there was an increase in scrutiny and intervention against the slave trade. Motivated by their own economic interests and responding to international pressure, the Belgian colonial authorities actively sought to suppress the slave trade and implemented various anti-slavery measures advocated by [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maludi |first=Hakim |date=20 March 2023 |title=RD Congo.

Uvira and nearby areas experienced violence and loss of civilian lives during these wars. On 18 October 1996, AFDL/RPA units reportedly killed at least 88 civilians in [[Kiliba]], located just thirteen kilometers north of Uvira. On the same day, AFDL/RPA units were responsible for the deaths of at least 51 civilians in [[Bwegera]], with the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] organizing [[Mass grave|mass burials]] for the victims.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Second Congo War – Attacks on other civilian populations – South Kivu |url=http://www.mapping-report.org/en/second-congo-war-attacks-on-other-civilian-populations-south-kivu/ |access-date=11 June 2023 |website=[[DRC Mapping Exercise Report|Democratic Republic of the Congo 1993-2003 UN Mapping Report]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

The capture of Uvira on 25 October 1996 saw renewed atrocities committed by AFDL/RPA/FAB units, including indiscriminate killings that resulted in the deaths of several hundred people, including [[Massacres of Hutus during the First Congo War|Hutu refugees]] and Zairean civilians.<ref name=":3" /> During the Second Congo War, ANC/RPA/FAB operatives killed dozens of civilians in Uvira on 6 August 1998.

=== Transport ===
The city benefits from its close geographical location, which enables it to engage in internal and external trade with [[Burundi]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], [[Rwanda]], the city of [[Bukavu]], [[Kalemie]], and the [[Fizi Territory]]. Itinerant trade, commuting, and freight forwarding are primarily conducted by the local population. The main [[public markets]] include Kalundu, Maendeleo, Kalimabenge, Soko Congolese "Zairians", Kasenga, Kanvimvira, and Kilomoni.<ref name=":8" />

The primary communication channels that facilitate traffic with the outside world are:

* The lake route ensures the transportation of people and [[goods]] on Lake Tanganyika, connecting neighboring and foreign countries such as Burundi, Tanzania, and Zambia. This route is serviced by [[boat]]s and [[ship]]s.<ref name=":8" />
