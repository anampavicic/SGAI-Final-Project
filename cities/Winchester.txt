The city lies at the heart of the wider [[City of Winchester]], a local government [[Districts of England|district]], at the western end of the [[South Downs]] National Park, on the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]]. It is {{convert|60|mi|km}} south-west of [[London]] and {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} from [[Southampton]], its nearest city. At the 2021 census, the built-up area of Winchester had a population of 48,478.

Winchester developed from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of [[Venta Belgarum]], which in turn developed from an [[Iron Age]] ''[[oppidum]]''. Winchester was one of the most important cities in England until the [[Norman conquest]] in the eleventh century. It has since become one of the most expensive and [[affluent]] areas in the United Kingdom.

The city's major landmark is [[Winchester Cathedral]]. The city is also home to the [[University of Winchester]] and [[Winchester College]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Adams |first=Henry Cadwallader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQkCAAAAYAAJ&dq=winchester+college+history&pg=PR1 |title=Wykehamica: A History of Winchester College and Commoners, from the Foundation to the Present Day |date=1878 |publisher=J.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The area around Winchester has been inhabited since [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric times]], with three [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[Hillforts in Britain|hillforts]], [[Oram's Arbour]], [[St Catherine's Hill, Hampshire|St. Catherine's Hill]], and Worthy Down all nearby. In the [[Late Iron Age]], a more urban settlement type developed, known as an ''[[oppidum]]'', although the archaeology of this phase remains obscure.

The settlement became an important centre for the [[Belgae#Britain|British Belgae]] tribe; however, it remains unclear how the Belgae came to control the initial settlement. Caesar recorded the tribe had crossed the channel as raiders (probably in the 1st century BCE), only to later establish themselves.<ref>[[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#12|5.2]]</ref> The Roman account of continental invaders has been challenged in recent years with scientific studies favouring a gradual change through increased trade links rather than migration.<ref>Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2#4|2.4]]</ref><ref>Cunliffe, Barry W., ''Iron Age Communities in Britain, Fourth Edition: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC, Until the Roman Conquest'', near Figure 1.4, 2012 (4th edition), Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v1Zkio7jluAC&dq=Britons+Iron+Age&pg=PT676] google preview, with no page numbers]</ref><ref>[[Sheppard Frere]], ''Britannia: a History of Roman Britain'', third edition, Pimlico, 1987; John Creighton, ''Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain'', Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref>

To the Celtic Britons, the settlement was probably known as '''Wentā''' or '''Venta''' (from a common [[Common Brittonic|Celtic word]] meaning "tribal town" or "meeting place").<ref>Matasović, Ranko. [http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/lemma.html?id=17429 "wentā" in the ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'' at ''Indo-European Etymological Dictionaries Online''. Brill Online, 2014.

===Roman period===
{{Main|Venta Belgarum}}
After the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], the settlement served as the capital ({{langx|la|civitas}}) of the Belgae and was distinguished as '''Venta Belgarum''', "Venta of the Belgae". Although in the early years of the Roman province it was of subsidiary importance to [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]] and [[Noviomagus Reginorum|Chichester]], Venta eclipsed them both by the latter half of the second century.<ref>Cunliffe B.

===Medieval period===
====Post-Roman Winchester====
Despite the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain]], urban life continued much as it had done into the mid fifth century. The settlement reduced in size, but work was carried out to improve the city's defences. The city may have functioned as a centre for a religious community or a royal palace, as they continued to use the Christian cemeteries established in the Roman period.

Winchester appears in early [[Welsh literature]] and is commonly identified as the city of {{nowrap|'''Cair Guinntguic'''}} listed among the [[Caer#Britain|28 cities of Britain]] in the ''[[History of the Britons]]'' (commonly attributed to [[Nennius]]).<ref>[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}).

Between 476 and 517 AD, the town and surrounding areas seems to have been fortified by several [[Jutes|Jutish]] settlements<ref>The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Worthy Park, Kingsworthy, Near Winchester, Hampshire (Oxford University School of Archaeology Monograph, 59).

====Kingdom of Wessex====

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - Wintan ceastre (British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A VI, folio 12r).jpg|thumb|left|A mention of Wintanceaster (here spelled ''Ƿintan ceastre'') in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'']]
The city became known as '''Wintanceaster''' ("Fort Venta") in [[Old English]].<ref name="Anglo-Saxon Dictionary">{{cite web|title=Wintan-ceaster|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/035936|website=Anglo Saxon Dictionary|publisher=Bosworth-Toller|access-date=18 June 2014}}</ref> In 648, [[King Cenwalh of Wessex]] erected the Church of St Peter and St Paul, later known as the [[Old Minster]]. This became a cathedral in the 660s when the West Saxon bishop's see was transferred from [[Dorchester on Thames]]. The present form of the city dates from reconstruction in the late 9th century, when [[King Alfred the Great]] obliterated the Roman street plan in favour of a new grid in order to provide better defence against the [[Viking invasions of Britain|Vikings]]. The city's first mint appears to date from this period.<ref name=WB>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England|year=2014|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-22492-1|title=Winchester|first=John|last=Crook|editor=Lapidge, Michael |display-editors=etal }}</ref>

In the early 10th century there were two new ecclesiastical establishments: the convent of [[Nunnaminster]], founded by Alfred's widow [[Ealhswith]],<ref>*{{cite encyclopedia |first=Marios|last =Costambeys | publisher = Oxford University Press | encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title= Ealhswith (d. 902)| year = 2004 | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39226 | access-date= 21 June 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/39226 }} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> and the [[New Minster]]. Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] was a leading figure in the monastic reform movement of the later 10th century. He expelled the secular canons of both minsters and replaced them with monks. He created the drainage system, the "Lockburn", which served as the town drain until 1875, and still survives. Also in the late 10th century, the Old Minster was enlarged as a centre of the cult of the 9th century [[Bishop of Winchester]], Saint [[Swithun]]. The three minsters were the home of what architectural historian John Crook describes as "the supreme artistic achievements" of the ''Winchester School''.<ref name=WB/>

The consensus among historians of Anglo-Saxon England is that the court was mobile in this period and there was no fixed capital.<ref>{{cite book |last= Stenton|first= Frank M.|author-link=Frank Stenton| title= Anglo-Saxon England|year= 1971|edition=3rd| publisher= Clarendon Press|page=539|isbn=978-0-19-280139-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Foot | first = Sarah | author-link=Sarah Foot| title=Æthelstan: the first king of England|publisher=Yale University Press| year = 2011 |page=78|isbn= 978-0-300-12535-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Naismith |first=Rory |title=Citadel of the Saxons: The Rise of Early London|page=11 |publisher=I.

There was a fire in the city in 1141 during the [[Rout of Winchester]]. In the 14th century, [[William of Wykeham]] played a role in the city's restoration. As [[Bishop of Winchester]] he was responsible for much of the current structure of the cathedral, and he founded the still extant public school [[Winchester College]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the city was an important centre of the wool trade, before going into a slow decline.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The [[curfew bell]] in the bell tower (near the clock in the picture), still sounds at 8:00 pm each evening.

====Jews in Winchester====

Jews lived in Winchester from at least 1148, and in the 13th century the Jewish community in the city was one of the most important in England. There was an [[Archa (document store)|archa]] in the city, and the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] was located in the city's heart (present day Jewry street). There were a series of [[blood libel]] claims against the Jewish community in the 1220s and 1230s, which was probably the cause of the hanging of the community's leader, Abraham Pinch, in front of the synagogue of which he was the head. [[Simon de Montfort]] ransacked the Jewish quarter in 1264, and in 1290 all Jews were [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] from England.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Winchester |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/winchester |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |access-date=2 July 2018 |archive-date=2 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702122324/https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/winchester |url-status=dead }}</ref>  A statue of [[Licoricia of Winchester]], described as "the most important Jewish woman in medieval England", located in Jewry Street, was unveiled by the then Prince of Wales on 10 February 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitwinchester.co.uk/blog/licoricia-of-winchester-statue-unveiled/|title=Licoricia of Winchester statue unveiled - Latest news from Visit Winchester}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Abrams |first=Rebecca |title=Licoricia of Winchester:  Power and Prejudice in Medieval England |date=2022 |publisher=The Licoricia of Winchester Appeal |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-3999-1638-7 |edition=1st |location=Winchester |publication-date=2022 |pages=xiii |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:The Buttercross in Winchester.jpg|thumb|left|The Winchester [[Buttercross]] ]]

The City Cross (also known as the [[Buttercross]]) has been dated to the 15th century, and features 12 statues of the [[Virgin Mary]], other saints and various historical figures. Several statues appear to have been added throughout the structure's history. In 1770, [[Thomas Dummer]] purchased the Buttercross from the Corporation of Winchester, intending to have it re-erected at [[Cranbury Park]], near [[Otterbourne]]. When his workmen arrived to dismantle the cross, they were prevented from doing so by the people of the city, who "organised a small riot",<ref>{{cite web |title= The Buttercross, Winchester |url=http://www.cityofwinchester.co.uk/history/html/buttercross.html |year= 1998| publisher= City of Winchester |access-date= 23 September 2009}}</ref> and they were forced to abandon their task.

In 1889, the city came under the new [[Hampshire County Council]], and the city was later administered by Winchester [[Urban district (England and Wales)|Urban District]]. Since 1974 the area has been governed as part of the wider [[City of Winchester]] district of [[Hampshire]]. The district has 16 electoral wards, five of these cover the former Urban District itself: St Barnabas, St Paul, St Luke, St Bartholomew, and St Michael;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.winchester.gov.uk/_images/pagecentre/18296/Ward%20Map%20-%2003May%202019.jpg|title=Winchester City Council Ward Map|website=Winchester City Council}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> they have three councillors each apart from St Luke, which is a two-member ward. For [[Hampshire County Council]] elections, the City of Winchester district is made up of 7 [[Division (political geography)|divisions]], with Winchester Westgate and Winchester Eastgate covering the town area.

Whilst the remainder of the district is parished, most of the five city wards constitutes an [[unparished area]]. As a result, they now make up Winchester Town Forum, which matches the former Winchester Urban District. Legally an area committee, it oversees the Town account and acts as a council committee to steer some decisions affecting the town. Unlike parishes, members are not directly-elected, but instead are the city councillors who were elected to the respective wards, who sit ''ex officio'' on the town forum. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-02 |title=Browse meetings - Winchester Town Forum |url=https://democracy.winchester.gov.uk/ieListMeetings.aspx?CommitteeId=159 |access-date=2024-09-02 |website=Winchester City Council}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web |title=Introducing Winchester Town Forum.

The current ward boundaries were adopted in [[2016 Winchester City Council election|2016]], when all seats were up for election. Since then, [[Winchester City Council elections]] take place in three out of every four years, with one third of the councillors elected in each election. From the [[2006 Winchester City Council election|2006 election]] until the [[2010 Winchester City Council election|2010 election]] the council was led by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].<ref name="changes">{{cite news |date=19 April 2008 |title=Winchester |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/local_council/08/html/24up.stm |access-date=4 February 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref> In 2010 it was controlled for a year by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], before being led again by the Conservatives from 2011 until [[2019 Winchester City Council election|2019]], since when the Liberal Democrats have again been in control. The wards are:

* St Barnabas (part under Littleton and Harestock Parish)
* [[St Bartholomew's Church, Winchester|St Bartholomew]]
* St Luke
* St Michael
* St Paul

St Barnabas predominantly covers [[Harestock]], [[Weeke]] and Teg Down. Harestock is part of [[Littleton and Harestock]] Parish whilst the remainder is part of the unparished area, but the entire ward is part of the Town Forum. The remaining wards are all completely unparished; St Bartholomew is predominantly composed of [[Abbotts Barton]], [[Hyde Abbey|Hyde]], and [[Winnall, Hampshire|Winnall]]; St Luke is predominantly composed of [[Stanmore]] and Winchester Village; St Michael is predominanlty composed of [[Bar End]], Highcliffe, Saint Giles Hill, [[Hospital of St Cross|St Cross]], and much of the city centre including the [[Winchester Cathedral|Cathedral]] Close; St Pauls is predominantly composed of Fulflood, Sleepers Hill, and West Hill.

[[Winchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Winchester]] is currently represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by [[Danny Chambers]], of the Liberal Democrats, who in the [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024 General Election]] beat [[Flick Drummond]], the Conservative candidate, by 13,821 votes (a margin of 24.2%).

The office of [[Mayor of Winchester]] currently exists as a ceremonial role, but dates back at least as far as the late 12th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Mayor|url=https://www.winchester.gov.uk/councillors-committees/mayor-of-winchester/history-mayor/|access-date=6 August 2020|website=Winchester City Council}}</ref> The mayoral term length is currently one year, and is the chair of [[Winchester City Council]], covering the wider district since 1974.

===Cathedral===
{{Main|Winchester Cathedral}}
[[File:Winchester Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1736947.jpg|thumb|upright=1.37|[[Winchester Cathedral]], showing its long nave]]

[[Winchester Cathedral]] was originally built in 1079 and remains the longest Gothic cathedral in Europe. It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute]] and [[William Rufus]].<ref name="RTGB">{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co. |year=2004}}</ref> It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name="RTGB" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.

Winchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.

The earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete{{clarify|date=September 2019}} rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.

Entrance for pedestrians to the North [[garth (architecture)|garth]] of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.<ref>Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green, Winton Pubs. Ltd. 1967. Page 90.</ref>

===Wolvesey Castle and Palace===
{{Main|Wolvesey Castle|Wolvesey Palace}}
[[Wolvesey Castle]] was the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] bishop's palace, dating from 1110, but standing on the site of an earlier Saxon structure. It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their [[Wedding of Mary I of England and Philip of Spain|wedding in the cathedral]]. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.

===Castle===
{{Main|Winchester Castle}}
[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Winchester Round Table]] in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]
Winchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century,  this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|access-date=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}</ref> (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks, Winchester|Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).<ref name="Ministry of Defence training">{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|access-date=18 June 2014}}</ref>

===Hospital of St Cross===
{{Main|Hospital of St Cross}}
[[File:Hospital of St Cross, Winchester.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Hospital of St Cross]], Winchester]]

The [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of the [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s. Since at least the 14th century, and still available today, a 'wayfarer's dole' of ale and bread has been handed out there. It was supposedly instigated to aid pilgrims on their way to [[Canterbury]].

===City museum===

==== Community Transport Schemes ====
Three different community transport schemes are on offer by Winchester City Council, those offerings are as follows:

* Dial-A-Ride - A service available from 8:45 am to 4:30 pm within the Winchester City Council district for those with a mobility or sensory impairment that would make it uncomfortable or impossible to ride in a taxi or bus. The minibuses the service use are fully wheelchair accessible and do not require that you be registered as disabled.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Connect Dial-a-Ride Winchester |url=https://www.cfirst.org.uk/community-transport/call-go-and-dial-a-ride/dial-a-ride-winchester/ |access-date=2023-08-23 |website=Community First |language=en-GB}}</ref>
* Voluntary Car-Share - These schemes are not exclusive to Winchester area, with many such schemes being offered throughout Hampshire and indeed the UK. This is where a group of volunteer drivers with their own vehicles offer transport to people in their area that're in need such as the vulnerable, those with low incomes (to provide an alternative to expensive taxi fares) or taking people to medical appointments when they otherwise couldn't get there themselves. <ref>{{Cite web |title=How to set up a voluntary car scheme |url=https://www.hants.gov.uk/transport/transportoperators/community-transport-kit/setting-up/voluntary-car-scheme |access-date=23 August 2023 |website=Hampshire County Council}}</ref>
* Wheels to Work - A scheme for use across Hampshire which is designed to allow people without access to public or private transport to find work, to go to vocational trainings or to attend interviews. The scheme offers a moped (50cc, 110cc or electric) on loan to those 16-25 for anywhere from 3-12 months depending on one's circumstances.  The scheme requires that the individual already hold a provisional drivers license and have passed their [[Compulsory Basic Training]] (which the scheme also offers to cover the cost for should the individual not have passed yet).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wheels to Work Scheme |url=https://www.hants.gov.uk/transport/wheelstowork |access-date=23 August 2023 |website=Hampshire County Council}}</ref>

[[Winchester railway station]] is served by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]] trains from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]], [[Weymouth railway station|Weymouth]], [[Portsmouth & Southsea railway station|Portsmouth]] and [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton]], as well as by [[CrossCountry]] between [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]], and either [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester]] or [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle]] via [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]]. Historically it was also served by a line to London via [[Alton railway station|Alton]], which partially survives as the [[Watercress Line]]. The closure of this line removed an alternative route between London and Winchester when, due to engineering works or other reasons, the main line was temporarily unusable. There was a second station called [[Winchester (Chesil) railway station|Winchester Chesil]] served by the [[Didcot, Newbury & Southampton Railway]]; this closed in the 1960s.<ref name="Hampshire County Council">{{cite news |title=Winchester Bus & Train Travel Times|publisher=Hampshire County Council|year=2011}}</ref>  This line provided a link to the [[Midlands]] and the North, bypassing the present longer route through [[Reading railway station|Reading]].
