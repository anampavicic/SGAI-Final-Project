Shijiazhuang is east of the [[Taihang Mountains]], a mountain range extending over {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} from north to south with an average elevation of {{convert|1500|to|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

==Name==
The city's present name, Shijiazhuang ({{zh|s=石家庄|link=no}}), first appeared during the [[Ming dynasty]]. Its literal meaning is "[[Shí (surname)|Shi]] family's village". The word Shijiazhuang was generally used after construction of the [[Shijiazhuang railway station|Shijiazhuang station]] of the [[Shijiazhuang–Taiyuan railway|Zhengtai Railway]] in 1907.

The origin of the name is heavily disputed. One story claimed that the [[Wanli Emperor]] sent 24 officers and their families to the area, after which the group splits into two settlements consisting of 10 and 14 families. The imperial court then named the settlements "village of 10 families" ({{zh|s=十家庄|labels=no}}) and "village of 14 families" (十四家庄), respectively. Since the Chinese characters for ten ({{zh|labels=no|c=十 |p=shí}}) and stone ({{zh|labels=no|c=石 |p=shí}}) are homophones, it is speculated that the city name gradually evolved into its current spelling. Another explanation is that the settlement was named after the highest-ranking official amongst the groups, who was surnamed [[Shí (surname)|Shi]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-02-20/091029516529.shtml |script-title=zh:一大拨有关石家庄地名由来的争论汹涌而来 |script-work=zh:燕赵都市报 |via=[[Sina Corp|Sina]] News |date=February 20, 2014 |access-date=January 23, 2020 |archive-date=September 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927062545/http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-02-20/091029516529.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> However, a county named Shiyi ({{zh|links=no|s=石邑 |l=stone city}}), in present-day [[Luquan District]], was already present during the [[Warring States period]], suggesting that the name, or its elements, have even older origins.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://maps.cga.harvard.edu/tgaz/placename/hvd_44971|title=China Historical GIS|publisher=[[Harvard University]] and [[Fudan University]]|access-date=January 9, 2021|archive-date=January 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111065329/https://maps.cga.harvard.edu/tgaz/placename/hvd_44971|url-status=live}}</ref>

At first, the settlement was officially known only as "Shijia", as the "zhuang" was solely used to denote the nature of the settlement being a village, instead of being part of its name. This was further evidenced on June 24, 1925, when the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican government]] ordered the village to be established as an autonomous city under the name Shijia. The city ended up being renamed as Shimen ({{zh|s=石门|labels=no}}) when it was officially incorporated on August 29, 1925, after the merger with another village, Xiumen ({{zh|links=no|s=休门 |l=auspicious gate}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjz.gov.cn/col/1493175311966/2017/04/26/1493196438418.html|script-title=zh:休门|publisher=Shijiazhuang People's Government|date=April 26, 2017|access-date=January 24, 2020|archive-date=January 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124203410/http://www.sjz.gov.cn/col/1493175311966/2017/04/26/1493196438418.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite being renamed, however, many documents and war plans from the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]] still referred to the city as "Shijiazhuang" or "Shizhuang".

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2023}}

===Pre-Qin period===

This area was occupied by [[Xianyu people]] at beginning of [[Zhou dynasty]]; it later belonged to the [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] (中山國) and [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] states during the pre-Qin period.

===Qin and Han dynasties===
In pre-[[Han dynasty|Han]] times (i.e., before 206 BC), the site of the city of Shiyi in the state of [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] was located in this area. After taking over [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] established the [[Changshan Commandery|Hengshan Commandery]] in the region. It became part of the [[Zhao Kingdom (Han dynasty)|Zhao Principality]] under [[Han dynasty#Western Han|Western Han]]. The land was briefly granted to Liu Buyi ({{lang|zh-Hant|劉不疑}}), son of the [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]], during [[Empress Dowager Lü]]'s reign. The territory was then passed to Liu Hong, [[Emperor Houshao of Han]], after Buyi's death. It was then granted to Liu Chao ({{lang|zh-Hant|劉朝}}), another son of Emperor Hui. During the [[Lü Clan Disturbance|defeat of the Lü clan]], Liu Chao was killed and the territory became a commandery of Zhao once again. Later, due to a [[naming taboo]] of [[Emperor Wen of Han]], whose [[Personal name#Eastern name order|personal name]] is Liu Heng, its name was changed to Changshan (常山).<ref name="Zhou Zhenhe">{{cite book |last1=Zhou |first1=Zhenhe |author-link1=Zhou Zhenhe |title=Xihan Zhengqu Dili |date=1987 |publisher=People's Press |pages=92–93}}</ref> From [[Han dynasty|Han]] (206 BC–AD 220) to [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581–618) times it was the site of a county seat named Shiyi.

===Tang dynasty===
With the reorganization of local government in the early period of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), Hengshan county was abolished, and it was reestablished as a prefecture. It was renamed as Zhen Prefecture due to a naming taboo with [[Emperor Muzong of Tang]], whose personal name was Li Heng.

===Yuan and Song dynasties===
[[Zhengding|Zhending]] was a giant city in the area, now [[Zhengding]] county, where was destination of migration from [[Yuan dynasty]] people and central area of preceding Northern [[Song dynasty]] people, particularly in [[Kaifeng]] and [[Zhengzhou]] etc. [[Marco Polo]] has glanced the city and noted it in his book.<ref>By Colonel Henry Yule, C.B., THE Book Ser [[Marco Polo]], The Venetian, Concerning the Kingdoms and Marvels of the East. Londom: John Murray, Albemarle street, 1875. p.7.</ref>

===Ming and Qing dynasties===
The name "Shijiazhuang" was first mentioned in 1535 on a [[Chinese stele|stele]] of a local temple. Shijiazhuang was then little more than a local [[market town]], subordinated to the flourishing city of [[Zhengding]] a few miles to the north.

===Republican era===

[[File:CHEU-KIA-TCHOUANG.jpg|thumb|left|Old platform of Shijiazhuang in 1907]]

The growth of Shijiazhuang into one of China's major cities began in 1905, when the Beijing–[[Wuhan]] ([[Hankou District|Hankou]]) [[Jinghan railway|railway]] reached the area, stimulating trade and encouraging local farmers to grow cash crops. Two years later the town became the junction for the new Shitai line, running from Shijiazhuang to [[Taiyuan]], Shanxi. The connection transformed the town from a local collecting center and market into a communications center of national importance on the main route from Beijing and [[Tianjin]] to Shanxi, and later, when the railway from Taiyuan was extended to the southwest, to [[Shaanxi]] as well. The city also became the center of an extensive road network.

[[File:日占时期石门市市徽.JPG|thumb|right|City seal during the Japanese occupation]]

Pre-[[World War II]], Shijiazhuang was a large [[railway town]] as well as a commercial and collecting center for Shanxi and regions farther west and for agricultural produce of the [[North China Plain]], particularly grain, tobacco, and cotton. By 1935, it had far outstripped Zhengding as an economic center. At the end of World War II the character of the city changed when it took on an administrative role as the preeminent city in western Hebei, and developed into an industrial city. Some industries, such as match manufacturing, tobacco processing, and glassmaking, had already been established before the war. By 1941, Shide railway line was constructed between Shijiazhuang and [[Dezhou]], [[Shandong]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war occupied period]], operated by [[North China Transportation Company]].

On November 12, 1947, the city was captured by Communist forces. [[Xibaipo]], a village about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} from downtown Shijiazhuang, in [[Pingshan County, Hebei|Pingshan County]] was the location of the Central Committee of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the headquarters of the [[People's Liberation Army]] during the decisive stages of the [[Chinese Civil War]] between May 26, 1948, and March 23, 1949, at which point they were moved to Beijing. Today, the area is a memorial site.<ref>

===People's Republic===
Since the city was pivotal to the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s victory of the [[Chinese Civil War]], many governmental agencies have roots in Shijiazhuang. The creation of the North China People's Government in 1947 affirmed the city's position as a key political center. A year later, as the result of the merger between the Bank of North China, the Bank of Beihai, and the Northwest Agricultural Bank, the [[People's Bank of China]] was established here, where it produced and released the [[first series of the renminbi]].<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:中国人民银行历史沿革|url=http://www.pbc.gov.cn/rmyh/105226/105433/index.html|access-date=January 9, 2021|script-work=zh:中国人民银行|archive-date=August 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811131357/http://www.pbc.gov.cn/rmyh/105226/105433/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the industrialization of the city also gathered momentum thanks to government initiatives including the [[Five-year plans of China|First Five-Year Plan]]. Shijiazhuang was one of the fourteen cities selected as focus cities for development. The population more than tripled in the decade 1948–58 after Communist won the civil war. In the 1950s, the city experienced a major expansion in the textile industry, with large-scale cotton spinning, weaving, printing, and dyeing works. In addition, there are plants processing local farm produce. In the 1960s it was the site of a new [[chemical industry]], with plants producing fertilizer and [[caustic soda]]. Shijiazhuang also became an engineering base, with a tractor-accessory plant. There are important coal deposits at [[Jingxing Mining District|Jingxing]] and Huailu, now named [[Luquan District|Luquan]], a few miles to the west in the foothills of the [[Taihang Mountains]], which provide fuel for a thermal-generating plant supplying power to local industries.

Tianjin was again carved out of Hebei in 1967, remaining a separate entity today. The provincial capital was then moved to [[Baoding]], however, the city was plunged into chaos due to the [[Cultural Revolution]] just a year later. Thus, under the direction of [[Mao Zedong]] to "prepare for war and natural disasters", Shijiazhuang became the provincial capital in 1968.

Beginning in the 1990s, Shijiazhuang saw another episode of rapid growth and development. Starting from the plains area in the east and south of the city, the focus of the developments later shifted towards the mountainous districts and counties in the west, as well as along the [[Hutuo River]] in the north.<ref name="history" />

In the early hours of March 16, 2001, four apartment buildings were leveled after [[Shijiazhuang bombings|a series of explosions]] rocked the city, killing 108 while injuring 38. The perpetrator was a deaf, unemployed man named Jin Ruchao who police arrested weeks later. Jin confessed that he had delivered the bombs via taxi and stated that the bombings were an act of revenge on his relatives, who were among the tenants of the apartments. Jin and his accomplices were later executed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Beijing Publishes Detailed Account of Bombings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/28/world/beijing-publishes-detailed-account-of-bombings.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 28, 2001|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Elisabeth|access-date=January 18, 2020|archive-date=February 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202025629/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/28/world/beijing-publishes-detailed-account-of-bombings.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Throughout the years, the city's administrative units have been shifted and adjusted multiple times. Initially, Shijiazhuang was administered under the prefecture of the same name, along with the counties of [[Zhengding]], [[Pingshan County, Hebei|Pingshan]], [[Lingshou County|Lingshou]], [[Jingxing County|Jingxing]], [[Pingshan County, Hebei|Jianping]], [[Huailu]], [[Jinxian]], [[Gaocheng District|Gaocheng]], [[Luancheng]], [[Zhao County|Zhaoxian]], [[Xinji|Shulu]], [[Yuanshi County|Yuanshi]], [[Zanhuang]], [[Gaoyi]], and one town, [[Xinji]]. The first new district of the city, [[Jingxing Mining District]], was created on June 27, 1950. On November 7, 1952, [[Hengshui]] Prefecture, to the east, was merged into Shijiazhuang, adding six more counties. The prefecture continued to expand after [[Dingzhou|Dingxian Prefecture]] was split and merged into [[Baoding]] and Shijiazhuang on June 18, 1954. Between March 1960 and May 1961, the prefecture and the city merged. Thereafter, however, the prefecture was re-established, with Hengshui Prefecture splitting away the next year. The city and its prefecture merged for good in June 1993. In the 2010s, Shijiazhuang's administrative divisions saw further changes. In 2013, the county-level city of [[Xinji]], although still part of Shijiazhuang prefecture, is now [[Sub-prefectural city|directly administered by Hebei province]]. Later, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] approved more adjustments to the city's divisions. [[Qiaodong District, Shijiazhuang|Qiaodong District]] was dissolved and merged into [[Chang'an District, Shijiazhuang|Chang'an]] and [[Qiaoxi District, Shijiazhuang|Qiaoxi]] districts. Three county-level cities, [[Gaocheng District|Gaocheng]], [[Luquan District|Luquan]], and [[Luancheng District|Luancheng]], became urban districts.<ref name="history">{{cite web |script-title=zh:城市概况 |url=http://www.sjz.gov.cn/col/1492479061391/2019/07/09/1562636058089.html |publisher=Shijiazhuang People's Government |date=July 9, 2019 |access-date=January 30, 2020 |archive-date=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922035649/http://www.sjz.gov.cn/col/1492479061391/2019/07/09/1562636058089.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nj50-5.jpg|thumb|Map including Shijiazhuang (labeled as SHIH-MEN (SHIHKIACHWANG) {{lang|zh-hant|石門}}) ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1954)]]
Shijiazhuang is located in south-central Hebei, and is part of the [[Bohai Economic Rim]]. Its administrative area ranges in latitude from 37° 27' to 38° 47' N, and the longitude 113° 30' to 115° 20' E. The prefecture-level city reaches a {{convert|148|km|0}} north–south extent and a {{convert|175|km|0}} wide from east to west. The prefecture has borders stretching {{convert|760|km|0}} long and covers an area of {{convert|15722|km2|0}}. Bordering prefecture-level cities in Hebei are [[Hengshui]] (E), [[Xingtai]] (S), and [[Baoding]] (N/NE). To the west lies the province of [[Shanxi]].

The city stands at the edge of the [[North China Plain]], which rises to the [[Taihang Mountains]] to the west of the city, and lies south of the [[Hutuo River]]. From west to east, the topography can be summarised as moderately high mountains, then low-lying mountains, hills, basin, and finally plains. Out of the eight east–west routes across the Taihang Mountains, the fifth, the [[Niangzi Pass]], connects the city directly with [[Taiyuan]], Shanxi.

The mountainous part of the prefecture consists of parts of:
*Jingxing Mining District
*Jingxing County
*Zanhuang County
*Xingtang County
*Lingshou County
*Yuanshi County
*Luquan District

The Hutuo River Basin in the east juts into: 
*Xinle City
*Wuji County
*Shenze County
*Jinzhou City
*Gaocheng District
*Gaoyi County
*Zhao County
*Luancheng District
*Zhengding County
*The metropolitan area and its suburbs, in their entirety
*All of the divisions mentioned in the above list, except for Jingxing Mining District

==Climate==
The city has a continental, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk / Dwa''), characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the [[Siberian anticyclone]]. Spring can see sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. January averages {{convert|−1.4|°C|1}}, while July averages {{convert|27.7|°C|1}}; the annual mean is {{convert|14.3|°C|1}}. With the monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 38&nbsp;percent in July to 56&nbsp;percent in May, the city receives 2,163 hours of sunshine annually. More than half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August alone. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|-26.5|°C|1}} to {{convert|42.8|°C|1}}.

According to the National Environmental Analysis released by [[Tsinghua University]] and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, Shijiazhuang was one of ten most air-polluted cities in the world. Also according to this report, 7 of 10 most air-polluted cities are in China, including [[Taiyuan]], Beijing, [[Urumqi]], [[Lanzhou]], Chongqing, [[Jinan]] and Shijiazhuang.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weather & Extreme Events: 7 of 10 Most Air-Polluted Cities Are in China|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/7-of-10-most-air-polluted-cities-china-130116.htm|access-date=September 1, 2014|work=January 16, 2013|agency=http://news.discovery.com|publisher=Imaginechina/Corbis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908214144/http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/7-of-10-most-air-polluted-cities-china-130116.htm|archive-date=September 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> As air pollution in China is at an all-time high, several northern cities are among the most polluted cities and have some of the worst air quality in China. Reporting on China's air quality has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country's several cities smothered in thick smog. According to a survey made by "Global voices China" in February 2013, Shijiazhuang is among China's 10 most polluted cities along with other cities including major Chinese cities like Beijing and [[Zhengzhou]], and 6 other prefectural cities all in [[Hebei]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bildner |first1=Eli |title=Interactive Maps of China's Most–and Least–Polluted Places |url=http://newsmotion.org/feed-story/interactive-maps-china%E2%80%99s-most%E2%80%93and-least%E2%80%93polluted-places |access-date=September 1, 2014 |work=Global Voices China |agency=http://newsmotion.org |date=February 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903071400/http://newsmotion.org/feed-story/interactive-maps-china%E2%80%99s-most%E2%80%93and-least%E2%80%93polluted-places |archive-date= September 3, 2014 }}</ref> These cities are all situated in traditional geographic subdivision of "Huabei (North China) Region".

== Demographics ==
Migrants flowing in from all across China largely contributed to the population growth of Shijiazhuang in recent times. With a population of 120,000 in 1947, Shijiazhuang became the first medium-large city captured by the Chinese Communist Party from the [[Kuomintang]]. By the time of the People's Republic of China's founding in 1949, the total urban population increased to more than 270,000 people, more than doubling in a span of two years. In 1953, when China rolled out its first five-year plan, the total population of Shijiazhuang's urban area increased to 320,000. In 1960, the total population of the Shijiazhuang urban area had reached 650,000. In 1968, the city experienced a substantial increase due to it being designated the capital of Hebei to avoid chaos in Baoding amidst the Cultural Revolution. By 1980, the urban population had surpassed the one million mark, joining the ranks of a large city. As of the end of 2017, the urban population of Shijiazhuang exceeded 4.5&nbsp;million.<ref name="population" />

Shijiazhuang has become a major industrial city in North China and is considered to be the economic center of Hebei province, along with [[Tangshan]]. The city also located in [[Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt]], which is one of the main Hi-Tech Belts in China. Nicknamed the "medicine hub of China", it is home to major pharmaceutical companies and factories like the North China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, [[Shijiazhuang Pharma Group]], and Shineway Pharma. The textile industry is also one of the backbones of the city's commerce.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} Other sectors include machinery and chemicals such as [[Shijiazhuang Donghua Jinlong]], building materials, light industry, and electronics. With abundant agricultural resources, Shijiazhuang has 590,000 hectares {{citation needed|date=February 2017}} of cultivated land and is the main source of cotton, pears, dates and walnuts in Hebei province.

In 2008, total imports reached US$1.393&nbsp;billion, an increase of 42.1&nbsp;percent over the previous year. Exports increased by 34.9&nbsp;percent to US$5.596&nbsp;billion. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

2006 World Bank reported that Shijiazhuang was spending less than RMB400 per capita on education, as opposed to Beijing (RMB1,044) and Weihai (RMB1,631).<ref name="Expat">{{cite web|title=China Expat city Guide|url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/list/102|publisher=China Expat|year=2009|access-date=February 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205165241/http://chinaexpat.com/list/102|archive-date=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Development zones===
*Shijiazhuang High-Tech Industrial Development Zone
The zone was established in March 1991 as a state-level development zone and is divided into three districts. National highways 107, 207, 307, 308 pass through the zone. It is {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} away from Shijiazhuang railway station, {{convert|105|km|abbr=on}} away from Tianjin Port. Industries include pharmaceuticals, electronic information, mechanical production, automobile manufacturing, chemicals production and logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/shijiazhuang-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone/|title=RightSite.asia – Shijiazhuang High-Tech Industrial Development Zone|website=rightsite.asia|access-date=May 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511002104/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/shijiazhuang-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone|archive-date=May 11, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Eastern District, located in the eastern part of Shijiazhuang, covers an area of {{convert|5.8|km2|abbr=on}}, and serves as the primary section of the New High-tech Industrial Development Zone. The district focuses on the establishment of new high-tech enterprises. There are plans to expand the district into an area of {{convert|9.8|km2|abbr=on}}. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} A railway line operated by Shijiazhuang Oil Refinery runs through the zone from north to south, so enterprises in the zone can build lines of their own.

The Western District, located in the southwest of Shijiazhuang, covers an area of {{convert|8.2|km2|abbr=on}}. It focuses on small- and medium-sized technology enterprises and technology incubation. Liangcun District, which borders the Western District, covers {{convert|4|km2|abbr=on}}, and focuses on the pharmaceutical industry and the [[petrochemical industry]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

By 2009, some 2,600 enterprises had settled in the zone, of which 185 were foreign-funded enterprises. Firms from Japan, the US, the Republic of Korea, Germany, Italy, Canada, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan had established themselves in the zone.<ref name="Expat" />

===Dairy===
The city is a center for the dairy trade, being the headquarters of the [[Sanlu Group]]. Sanlu became Shijiazhuang's largest taxpayer since it had become the largest formula seller in China for a continuous 15-year period. [[Richard McGregor]], author of ''[[The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers]]'', said that Sanlu became "an invaluable asset for a city otherwise struggling to attract industry and investment on a par with China's premier metropolises."<ref name=McGregor182>{{Cite book|author=McGregor, Richard|author-link=Richard McGregor|title=The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers|publisher=[[Harper Perennial]]|location=New York|year=2012|isbn=978-0-06-170876-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxchbfKHfhsC&q=Shijiazhuang&pg=PA204|page=182|access-date=November 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427175951/https://books.google.com/books?id=TxchbfKHfhsC&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=%22perhaps+China's+most+globally+successful+company%22&source=bl&ots=9OoF_wL16E&sig=_np2k1Shh8C80SBEEGC4jodiRpE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7ap4UIOWOIrE9gSG7IHoDg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Shijiazhuang&f=false|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Both the dairy trade and Sanlu were affected by the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]]. The chairman and general manager of Sanlu, and several party officials, including the vice-mayor in charge of food and agriculture, Zhang Fawang, were reportedly removed from office.<ref name=21more>Klaudia Lee, "Tests find tainted baby milk at 21 more firms", Page A1, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (September 17, 2008)</ref><ref name=sacked>''Xinhua'', [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/17/content_10046973.htm "Officials, company manager sacked following baby milk powder scandal"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103172922/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/17/content_10046973.htm |date=January 3, 2009 }}, chinaview.cn (September 16, 2008)</ref><ref>Lee Spears, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=a1rfKvOp3xwc&refer=asia China Revokes `Inspection-Free' Right as Milk Scandal Spreads] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230316105154/https://www.bloomberg.com/politics?pid=20601080&refer=asia&sid=a1rfKvOp3xwc |date=March 16, 2023 }}, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], (September 17, 2008)</ref> Mayor Ji Chuntang reportedly resigned on September 17, 2008.<ref name=four>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/18/content_10075004.htm Death toll rises to four in tainted baby formula scandal in China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105025600/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/18/content_10075004.htm |date=January 5, 2009 }}, ''Xinhua'' (September 18, 2008)</ref>

==Transportation==
===Expressways===
The city is served by many expressways, including the [[Shitai Expressway|Shitai]], Beijing–[[Shenzhen]] and [[Taiyuan]]–[[Cangzhou]] Expressways.

===Railway===
[[File:Eastern facade of Shijiazhuang Railway Station (20160615145320).jpg|thumb|[[Shijiazhuang railway station]].]]
Shijiazhuang is a transportation hub at the intersection point of the Beijing–[[Guangzhou]], [[Taiyuan]]–[[Dezhou]], and [[Shuozhou]]–[[Huanghua, Hebei|Huanghua]] railways. The new [[Shijiazhuang railway station]] (opened December 2012) has a rare distinction of being served by both the "conventional" [[Beijing–Guangzhou Railway]] and the new [[Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong High-Speed Railway]]. Such an arrangement is fairly uncommon on China's [[High-speed rail in China|high-speed rail network]], as typically high-speed lines are constructed to bypass city cores, where the older "conventional" train stations are.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/Engineering/research/CenterSustainableUrbanInfrastructure/LowCarbonCities/Documents/Wing-tat_Hung/WTHung_high_speed_rail.pdf|title=Critical Issues of High Speed Rail Development in China|first1=Wing-tat|last1=Hung|first2=Lara|last2=Brunello|first3=Jonathan|last3=Bunker|page=4}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
