'''Dum Dum''' is a city and a municipality in the [[Kolkata Metropolitan Area]] of [[North 24 Parganas district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is a part of the area covered by [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA). The [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport]], also known as [[Kolkata Airport]], is situated at Dum Dum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nscbiairport.com/additional_information/airport_info|title=NSCBI Airport, Dum Dum|website=nscbiaiport.com|access-date=18 Aug 2024}}</ref>

==Etymology==
During the 19th century the area was home to the [[Dum Dum Arsenal]], a British [[Royal Artillery]] facility. It was here that, in the early 1890s, Captain [[Neville Bertie-Clay]] developed a [[bullet]] with the jacket cut away at the tip to reveal its soft lead core (see [[hollow-point bullet]]), known informally as a [[dum-dum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/dumdum.htm|title=First World War.com - Encyclopedia - Dum-Dum Bullet|website=www.firstworldwar.com|access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india9.com/i9show/Dum-Dum-62467.htm|title=Dum Dum in Kolkata India|website=www.india9.com|access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ambient.ca/cpunk/flipperammo.html|title=BlackHammer CyberPunk Project: F.I.D.

The previous name of Dum Dum was "Domdoma".

In the history of Bengal, Dum Dum holds a very significant place. Dum Dum was sparsely populated before the British came there. The area was slightly elevated. On 6 February 1757, an accord was signed at Dum Dum by the [[Nawab of Bengal]] to allow the British to build forts at Calcutta, Dacca and Kashim Bazar. In 1783, a Cantonment was established at Dum Dum. Military barracks were built and civilians started coming in to provide essential services to the military personnel. A Cantonment Board was formed to provide civic amenities. On 9 February 1822, the foundation stone was blessed and laid for Saint Patrick’s Chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rvasia.org/church-asia/india-st-patricks-church-kolkata-celebrates-bi-centenary|title=St. Patrick’s Church in Kolkata celebrates bi-centenary|publisher=Nikhil Gomes, RVA News|access-date=18 August 2024}}</ref> On Good Friday in 1823, the chapel was dedicated and inaugurated with Irish priest M. Murphy as its chaplain. The ordnance factory was established at Dum Dum in 1846. The St. Stephens Church, a Roman Catholic Church Weslyan Chapel and a hospital for treatment of European were established in the central hub of Dum Dum Cantonment of old Dum Dum. It may be noted that both South Dum Dum Municipality and North Dum Dum Municipality were established in 1870 thereby somewhat defining administratively the different parts of an earlier undefined Dum Dum area. subsequently, Dum Dum was enlarged by the amalgamation of Kadihati municipality in 1883.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url = https://dumdummunicipality.wordpress.com/  | title = Dum Dum Municipality | work = Chronicles of Dum Dum | publisher = DDM | access-date = 20 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ordnancedumdum.gov.in/index.php  | title =  Ordnance Factory Dum Dum | work = History – Dum Dum Story | publisher =  OFDD | access-date =  20 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =  https://northdumdummunicipality.org/about/history-of-north-dum-dum-municipality/ | title = North Dum Dum municipality | work = About us  | publisher =  NDDM | access-date =  11 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://barrackpore.gov.in/home/south_dumdum_municipality | title = South Dum Dum Municipality | publisher = Barrackpore administration  | access-date =  20 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sylhetiyouthwelfareassociation.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/dum-dum-cantonment/|title=History of Old Dum Dum|work=wordpress.com|access-date=18 August 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Dum-Dum|title=Dum Dum|publisher=Britannica|access-date=2 September 2024}}</ref>

Dum Dum was once a separate subdivision from 1861 to 1896. During the early years of the cantonment the British waged several imperial wars, out of which the wars in Burma, Nepal, the Deccan and Afganisthan were costly in blood and lives. Two monuments were erected to commemorate their memory. The Afghan War Memorial was built in Dum Dum in 1841 after the British lost the first Anglo-Afghan war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengals-183-year-old-tryst-with-afghans/articleshow/85575590.cms|title=Bengal’s 183-year-old tryst with Afghans|work=The Times of India|access-date=18 August 2024}}</ref> During the 1857 disturbances the Indian sepoys posted at Dum Dum were affected and [[Mangal Pandey]] was hanged from a tree at Dum Dum (his dead body was probably hanged at both Barrackpore and Dum Dum Cantonment). Dum Dum Cantonment was closed down and the Cantonment Board was replaced by Dum Dum Municipality in 1929. The temporary set back to Dum Dum arising from abolition of the cantonment and departure of British troops, was partially made up with the shifting of Jessop & Co. from Howrah to Dum Dum in 1928 and establishment of the Gramophone Company at Dum Dum in 1929. Bengal Flying Club, established in 1920, had a small fleet of single engine moth planes. The independence movement led to the sudden development of the Central Jail, where many top leaders and more numerous unknown patriots were lodged. The old military barracks made way for multi-storied jail barracks. The environment quite often reverberated with the chanting of ''[[Vande Mataram]]''.<ref name=history/>

With the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] in 1947, "millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile [[East Pakistan]]."<ref>Chatterjee, Monideep, "Town Planning in Calcutta: Past, Present and Future",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Page 142, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref> In the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but "it was squatters who made the [[East Bengali refugees]] famous or infamous." Squatting (''jabardakhal'' in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. "This happened as early as 1948 with middle class refugees in the [[Jadavpur#History|Jadavpur]] area: first on government land and then on private property, leading to violent clashes. Having won the battle, the elated squatters named their colony ‘Bijaygarh’, the Fort of Victory." By 1949, there were 40 such colonies in Jadavpur, Kasba, Santoshpur, Garia and Behala, in the south-eastern part of the city, and 65 in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone in the north. Subsequently squatters colonies also came up along the west bank of the Hooghly and by 1950, there were 150 such colonies. It has to be borne in mind that the squatters were in a way "self-settlers" in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government or administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres.<ref>Chatterjee, Nilanjana, "The East Bengal Refugees: A Lesson in Survival",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Pages 72-75, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271664458 |title =  The Myths Refugees Live By Memory and History of the Making of Bengali Refugee Identity |first=Uditi|last=Sen|journal =  Modern Asian Studies|volume =  48|pages =  37–76| access-date = 5 March 2018|doi = 10.1017/S0026749X12000613 |year = 2014 |s2cid = 144297665 }}</ref> Efforts have been made in more recent years to regularise land/property rights in the refugee colonies.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://bangalnama.wordpress.com/2009/08/31/the-refugee-city-partition-and-kolkata%E2%80%99s-postcolonial-landscape/ |title = The Refugee City: Partition and Kolkata's Post-colonial landscape| publisher= Bangalnama, 31 August 2009| access-date = 13 March 2018|date = 31 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url = https://www.academia.edu/2132220|title =  Dilemas of Diaspora: Partition, Refugees and the Politics of 'Home'|journal = Pablo Bose | publisher= academia.edu| access-date = 13 March 2018|author1 = Bose}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/4m-refugees-entered-West-Bengal-after-1971/articleshow/660584.cms|title = 4m refugees entered West Bengal after 1971 |work = Nirmalya Banerjee | publisher= The Times of India, 11 August 2000| access-date = 13 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.telegraphindia.com/1080730/jsp/calcutta/story_9620602.jsp| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080920012855/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080730/jsp/calcutta/story_9620602.jsp| url-status = dead| archive-date = 20 September 2008|title =  Civic tax net on colony plots | publisher= 30 July 2008| access-date = 13 March 2018}}</ref>
