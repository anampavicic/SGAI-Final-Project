The city is scheduled to host the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] closing ceremonies.

==History==
{{Main|History of Verona}}
{{For timeline}}

The precise details of Verona's early history remain a mystery along with the origin of its name. One theory is that it was a city of the [[Euganei]], who were obliged to give it up to the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]] (550 BC). With the conquest of the Valley of the [[Po (river)|Po]], the Veronese territory became Roman about 300 BC. Verona became a Roman {{Lang|la|[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]}} in 89 BC. It was classified as a ''[[municipium]]'' in 49 BC, when its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe ''Poblilia'' or ''Publicia''.

The city became important because it was at the intersection of several roads. [[Stilicho]], a military commander in the [[Late Roman army|Roman army]], defeated [[Alaric I|Alaric]] and his [[Visigoths]] here in 402. Later, Verona was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 489, and the [[Goths|Gothic]] domination of Italy began. [[Theoderic the Great]] was said to have built a palace there. It remained under the power of the Goths throughout the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War (535–552)]], except for a single day in 541, when the Byzantine officer [[Artabazes (military officer)|Artabazes]] made an entrance. The defections of the Byzantine generals over the booty made it possible for the Goths to regain possession of the city. In 552 the Romans under the general [[Valerian (general)|Valerian]] vainly endeavored to enter the city, but it was only when the Goths were fully overthrown that they surrendered it.<ref name="James2014">{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Edward |title=Europe's Barbarians AD 200-600 |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-86824-8 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVkSBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT105}}</ref>

In 569, it was taken by [[Alboin]], King of the [[Lombards]],<ref name="Petersen2013">{{cite book |last1=Petersen |first1=Leif Inge Ree |title=Siege Warfare and Military Organization in the Successor States (400-800 AD): Byzantium, the West and Islam |year=2013 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-25446-6 |page=566 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRGaAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA566}}</ref> in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second most important city.

[[Adalgis]]us, son of [[Desiderius]], in 774 made his last resistance in Verona to [[Charlemagne]], who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom.<ref name="Riché1993">{{cite book |last1=Riché |first1=Pierre |title=The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe |year=1993 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-1342-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcjy7bCmFL0C&pg=PA97}}</ref> Verona became the ordinary residence of the [[King of Italy|kings of Italy]], the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of Count [[Milo of Verona|Milo]], progenitor of the counts of [[San Bonifacio]]. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there.

Under [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule, Verona was alternatively known in [[German language|German]] as {{lang|de|Bern}}, {{lang|de|Welsch-Bern}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeno.org/Brockhaus-1911/A/Welsch-Bern |title=Welsch-Bern |publisher=Zeno.org |date= |accessdate=2022-02-26}}</ref> or {{lang|de|[[Dietrich von Bern|Dietrichsbern]]}}. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] ceded to Verona the [[March of Verona|marquisate]] dependent on the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], however, the increasing wealth of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1135 Verona was organised as a free commune. In 1164 Verona joined with [[Vicenza]], [[Padua]] and [[Treviso]] to create the [[Veronese League]], which was integrated with the [[Lombard League]] in 1167 to battle against [[Frederick I Barbarossa]]. Victory was achieved at the [[Battle of Legnano]] in 1176, and the [[Treaty of Venice]] signed in 1177 followed by the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Solinas|first=Giovanni|title=Storia di Verona|year=1981|language=it}}</ref>

When [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] was elected ''[[podestà]]'' in 1226, he converted the office into a permanent lordship. In 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona).{{Clarification needed|reason=What was the reason of the massacre?|date=June 2023}} Upon his death, the Great Council elected Mastino I della Scala as podestà, and he converted the "signoria" into a family possession, though leaving the [[Burgher (social class)|burghers]] a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podestà in 1262, he affected a coup d'état, and was acclaimed Capitano del Popolo, with the command of the communal troops. Long internal discord took place before he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podestà. In 1277, Mastino della Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles.

[[File:Canweb1.JPG|thumb|left|Equestrian statue of [[Cangrande I della Scala|Cangrande I]]|alt=]]

The reign of his son Alberto della Scala as capitano (1277–1302) was a time of incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and [[Cangrande I della Scala]] (1291–1329), only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giotto]]. By war or treaty, he brought under his control the cities of [[Treviso]] (1308), [[Vicenza]] (1311), and [[Padua]] (1328). At that time before the [[Black death]], the city was home to more than 40,000 people.<ref>David Abulafia, ''Short Oxford History of Italy: Italy in the Central Middle Ages'', Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>

[[File:Arche scaligere (Verona).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Arche scaligere|Arche Scaligere]], tombs of the ancient lords of Verona.]]

Cangrande was succeeded by [[Mastino II della Scala|Mastino II]] (1329–1351) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering [[Brescia]] in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the [[Mincio]]. He purchased [[Parma]] (1335) and [[Lucca]] (1339). After the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]], he was the richest prince of his time. A powerful league was formed against him in 1337 – [[Florence]], [[Venice]], the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]. After a three years war, the [[Scaliger]] dominions were reduced to Verona and [[Vicenza]] (Mastino's daughter Regina-Beatrice della Scala married to [[Bernabò Visconti|Barnabò Visconti]]). Mastino's son [[Cangrande II della Scala|Cangrande II]] (1351–1359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburg mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359–1375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375–1387), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] of [[Milan]] made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight on 19 October 1387, thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments.

[[File:Leone di San Marco a Verona.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lion of Saint Mark]], located in Piazza delle Erbe, the symbol of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]|alt=]]

The year 1387 is also the year of the [[Battle of Castagnaro]], fought between [[Giovanni Ordelaffi]] for Verona and [[John Hawkwood]] for [[Padua]]. The latter emerged as the winner.

Antonio's son [[Canfrancesco della Scala|Canfrancesco]] attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people and the [[Carraresi]], he drove out the [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]ese, but he died ten days after. After a period of Cararrese rule, Verona [[Devotion of Verona to Venice|submitted to Venice]] (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings.

From 1508 to 1517, the city was in the power of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]]. There were numerous outbreaks of the [[Black Death|plague]], and in [[Italian plague of 1629–1631|1629–1633]], Italy was struck by its worst outbreak in modern times. Around 33,000 people died in Verona (over 60% of the population at the time) in 1630–1631.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&pg=PA103 Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history]''". J. N. Hays (2005). p.103.{{ISBN|1-85109-658-2}}</ref>

In 1776, a method of bellringing was developed called [[Veronese bellringing art]]. Verona was occupied by [[Napoleon]] in 1797, but on [[Easter Monday]] the populace [[Veronese Easter|rose and drove out]] the French. It was then that Napoleon made an [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|end]] of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. Verona became [[Austrian Empire|Austrian territory]] when Napoleon signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] in October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. It was taken from Austria by the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], but was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]].

The [[Congress of Verona]], which met on 20 October 1822, was part of the [[:Category:Post-Napoleonic congresses|series of international conferences or congresses]], opening with the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814–1815, that marked the continuing enforcement of the "[[Concert of Europe]]".

In 1866, following the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], Verona, along with the rest of Venetia, became part of a united Italy.

The advent of [[fascism]] added another dark chapter to the annals of Verona. Throughout Italy, the Jewish population was hit by the [[Manifesto of Race]], a series of anti-Semitic laws passed in 1938, and after the invasion by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1943, deportations to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. An Austrian Fort (now a church, the Santuario della Madonna di Lourdes), was used to incarcerate and torture [[Allies of World War II|Allied troops]], Jews and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascists]], especially after 1943, when Verona became part of the [[Italian Social Republic]].

During Austrian rule Verona became of great strategic importance to the regime. [[Galeazzo Ciano]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s son-in-law, was accused of plotting against the republic; in a [[show trial]] staged in January 1944 by the Nazi and fascist hierarchy at [[Castelvecchio Museum|Castelvecchio]] (the [[Verona trial]]), Ciano was executed on the banks of the Adige with many other officers on what is today Via Colombo. This marked another turning point in the escalation of violence that would only end with the final liberation by allied troops and partisans on 26 April 1945.

After World War II, as Italy joined the [[NATO]] alliance, Verona once again acquired its strategic importance, due to its geographical closeness to the [[Iron Curtain]]. The city became the seat of SETAF (South European Allied Terrestrial Forces) and had during the whole duration of the [[Cold War]] period a strong military presence, especially American, which has since decreased.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Verona has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characteristic of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot summers and cool, humid winters, even though [[Lake Garda]] has a partial influence on the city.<ref>Thomas A. Blair, Climatology: General and Regional, Prentice Hall pages 131–132; Adriana Rigutti, Meteorologia, Giunti, p, 95, 2009.</ref> The [[relative humidity]] is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes [[fog]], mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become less and less frequent in recent years.

==Government==

[[File:Palazzo Barbieri-XE3F2501a.jpg|thumb|250x250px|left|''Palazzo Barbieri'' is Verona's city hall]]

Since the local government political reorganization in 1993, Verona has been governed by the City Council of Verona, which is based in ''[[Palazzo Barbieri]]''. Voters elect directly 33 councilors and the mayor of Verona every five years.

Verona is also the capital of its own province. The Provincial Council is seated in ''Palazzo del Governo''. The current mayor of Verona is [[Damiano Tommasi]], elected on 26 June 2022.<ref name="Damiano">{{Cite web |date=2022-06-26 |title=Damiano Tommasi è il nuovo sindaco di Verona |url=http://www.ilpost.it/2022/06/27/verona-elezioni-tommasi-sindaco-sboarina/ |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=Il Post |language=it-IT}}</ref>

Verona has traditionally been a right-wing traditionalist Catholic city, reflecting its former status as one of the major cities of [[Italian Social Republic]], and the right-wing politics of the Veneto region. In October 2018, Verona became the first city in Italy to declare itself pro-life, and hosted the American [[Christian right]] lobby group [[World Congress of Families]]' conference in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-04-01 |title=Italy's city of love becomes a battlefield |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/verona-italy-world-congress-of-families-lgbt-protests/ |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=POLITICO |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=How Verona became a 'model city' for far-Right and ultra-Catholic alliances |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/verona-model-city-far-right-ultra-catholic-alliances/ |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=openDemocracy |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-10-05 |title=Verona defies Italy's abortion law and declares itself a 'pro-life city' |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20181005/verona-pro-life-city-italy-abortion-law/ |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=The Local Italy |language=en-US}}</ref> Despite this, since the mayors became directly elected in 1994, the city has elected two left-wing mayors - Paolo Zanotto in 2002 and current mayor Damiano Tommasi in 2022, largely due to incumbent mayor [[Federico Sboarina]]'s refusal to include center-right parties in his right-wing coalition.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-27 |title=Centre-left secures key victories in Italy's local election runoffs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/27/italy-local-election-runoffs-centre-left-verona |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

==Main sights==
{{See also|Monuments of Verona}}{{category see also|Buildings and structures in Verona}}

Because of the value and importance of its many historical buildings, Verona has been named a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Verona preserved many ancient Roman monuments (including the magnificent [[Verona Arena|Arena]]) in the [[early Middle Ages]], but many of its early medieval edifices were destroyed or heavily damaged by the [[earthquake of 3 January 1117]], which led to a massive [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] rebuilding. The [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian period]] ''[[Versus de Verona]]'' contains an important description of Verona in the early medieval era.

[[File:PanoramaCSP.jpg|800px|thumb|center|Panoramic view of the city from Castel San Pietro]]

===Roman edifices===

The [[Roman legion|Roman military]] settlement in what is now the center of the city was to expand through the [[Cardo|cardines]] and [[Decumanus Maximus|decumani]] that intersect at right angles. This structure has been kept to the present day and is clearly visible from the air. Further development has not reshaped the original map. Though the Roman city with its basalt-paved roads is mostly hidden from view it stands virtually intact about 6&nbsp;m below the surface. Most palazzi and houses have cellars built on Roman structures that are rarely accessible to visitors.

[[File:Italy - Verona - Arena.jpg|thumb|left|[[Verona Arena|Arena of Verona]]]]

Verona is famous for its [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[amphitheater]], the [[Verona Arena|Arena]], found in the city's largest piazza, the [[Piazza Bra]]. Completed around 30 AD, it is the third-largest in Italy after Rome's [[Colosseum]] and the [[Amphitheatre of Capua]]. It measures 139 meters long and 110 meters wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The ''[[ludi]]'' (shows and [[gladiator]] games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story [[Facade|façade]] is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink [[limestone]] from [[Valpolicella]], with three stories remains. The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre, and open-aired [[opera]] during warm summer nights.

[[File:Piazza delle Erbe - Palazzo Maffei (Verona).jpg|thumb|right|[[Piazza delle Erbe, Verona|Piazza delle Erbe]]]]

[[Piazza delle Erbe, Verona|Piazza delle Erbe]], near the Roman forum was rebuilt by [[Cangrande I della Scala|Cangrande I]] and [[Cansignorio della Scala|Cansignorio della Scala I]], lords of Verona, using material (such as marble blocks and statues) from Roman spas and villas.

There is also a variety of other [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman monuments]] to be found in the town, such as the [[Roman theatre of Verona]]. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing. In the 18th century Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese, bought all the houses that in time had been built over the theatre, demolished them, and saved the monument. Not far from it is the [[Ponte Pietra (Verona)|Ponte di Pietra]] ("Stone Wall Bridge"), another Roman landmark that has survived to this day.

The ''[[Arco dei Gavi]]'' was built in the 1st century AD and is famous for having the name of the builder (architect [[Lucius Vitruvius Cordo]]ne) engraved on it, a rare case in the architecture of the epoque. It originally straddled the main [[Roman roads|Roman road]] into the city, now Corso Cavour. It was demolished by French troops in 1805 and rebuilt in 1932.

[[File:Porta Borsari (Verona).jpg|thumb|left|[[Porta Borsari]]]]

Nearby is the ''[[Porta Borsari]]'', an archway at the end of Corso Porta Borsari. This is the façade of a 3rd-century gate in the original Roman [[Defensive wall|city walls]]. The inscription is dated 245 AD and gives the city name as ''Colonia Verona Augusta''. Corso Porta Borsari, the road passing through the gate is the original [[Via Sacra]] of the Roman city. Today, it is lined with several [[Renaissance]] [[Palazzo|palazzi]] and the ancient [[Santi Apostoli, Verona|Church of Santi Apostoli]], a few meters from Piazza delle Erbe.

''[[Porta Leoni]]'' is the 1st century BC ruin of what was once part of the Roman [[city gate]]. A substantial portion is still standing as part of the wall of a medieval building. The street itself is an open [[archaeological site]], and the remains of the original Roman street and gateway foundations can be seen a few feet below the present street level. As can be seen from there, the gate contains a small court guarded by towers. Here, carriages and travelers were inspected before entering or leaving the city.

The ''[[Santo Stefano, Verona|Santo Stefano]]'' church is dedicated to the first Christian martyr, was erected in the [[Paleochristian]] era, and houses the burials of the first bishops of Verona. Throughout the centuries [[Saint Stephen]] underwent complex architectural transformations. Particularly striking is the rare two-story ambulatory, probably built to give pilgrims visual access to the abundant collection of important relics for which the church was famous. Also to be visited is the cruciform crypt with its forest of columns, arches, and cross vaults. Saint Stephen was the first Christian [[martyr]] and, according to the Acts of the Apostles, was stoned just outside Jerusalem, in a place still remembered today, near the so-called "[[Porta Leoni]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Santo Stefano – Fondazione Verona Minor Hierusalem|url=http://www.veronaminorhierusalem.it/rebirth-from-water/santo-stefano/?lang=en|access-date=2020-11-11|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Medieval architecture===

[[File:San Zeno VR.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica di San Zeno|San Zeno Basilica]], like many other Veronese churches, is built with alternating layers of white stone and bricks]]

The ''[[Basilica di San Zeno|Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore]]'' is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style church, the third such structure on its site, built from 1123 to 1135, over the 4th-century shrine to Verona's [[patron saint]], [[Zeno of Verona|St. Zeno]] (bishop of Verona from 362 to 380<ref>{{cite web|title=Basilica di San Zeno Maggiore|url=https://verona.com/en/verona/chiesa-di-san-zeno-maggiore/|access-date=2021-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref> when he died). The [[Facade|façade]] dominates the large square, and is flanked with a 72-meter-tall [[bell tower]], which is mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in Canto 18 of Purgatory in the [[Divine Comedy]]. The weathered Veronese stone gives a warm golden glow, and the restrained lines of the pillars, columns, and cornices, and the gallery with its double windows, give the façade an air of harmonious elegance. The huge [[rose window]] is decorated as a [[Rota Fortunae|Wheel of Fortune]]. The lintels above the portal have carvings of the months of the year. Each side of the doorway is embellished with 18 [[Relief|bas-relief]] panels of biblical scenes, and the inner [[bronze]] door panels have 48 primitive but forceful depictions of Biblical scenes and episodes from the life of St Zeno. The meaning of some of the scenes is now unknown, but the extraordinarily vivid energy of the figures is a superb blend of traditional and [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] influences. The interior of the church is divided into the Lower Church, occupying about ⅔ of the structure, and the Upper Church, occupying the remainder. The walls are covered with 12th and 14th century [[fresco]]s and the ceiling of the [[nave]] is a magnificent example of a ship's keel ceiling. The vaulted [[crypt]] contains the tomb of [[Zeno of Verona|St. Zeno]], the first [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Verona|Bishop of Verona]], as well as the tombs of several other saints. North of the church is a pleasant cloister. The church also houses the tomb of King [[Pepin of Italy|Pippin]] of Italy (777–810).

[[File:Piazza dei Signori (Verona).jpg|thumb|left|[[Piazza dei Signori, Verona|Piazza dei Signori]]]]
[[Piazza dei Signori, Verona|Piazza dei Signori]] is an elegant medieval square with various buildings and towers. It has a monument dedicated to [[Dante Alighieri]].

The ''Basilica of San Lorenzo'' is another Romanesque church, albeit smaller. It dates from around 1177, but was built on the site of a [[Early Christianity|Paleochristian]] church, fragments of which remain. The church is built of alternating tracks of [[brick]] and stone, and has two cylindrical towers, housing spiral staircases to the women's galleries. The interior is sober but still quiet. The striped bands of stone and brick and the graceful arches complement the setting.

''[[Santa Maria Antica]]'' is a small [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church that served as the private [[chapel]] of the [[House of Scaliger|Scaligeri]] clan, and is famous for the Gothic [[Scaliger Tombs]].

[[File:Italy - Verona - Cathedral.jpg|thumbnail|right|The [[Verona Cathedral]]]]

The ''[[Verona Cathedral]]'', also known as the Duomo, is a notable Romanesque church.

[[Sant'Anastasia (Verona)|Sant'Anastasia]] is a huge and lofty church built from 1290 to 1481 by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] to hold the massive congregations attracted by their sermons. The Pellegrini chapel houses the fresco ''St. George and the Princess of Trebizond'' by [[Pisanello]] as well as the [[Wilhelm von Bibra|grave of Wilhelm von Bibra]]. An art festival is held in the square each May.

The [[Castelvecchio Bridge]], also known as Ponte Scaligero, is a segmental [[arch bridge]]. At the time of its completion in 1356, it was the world's largest bridge arch. It has a span length of {{convert|48.70|m|2|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Italy - Verona - Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi.jpg|thumb|[[Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi]], which was used as a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup is home to Verona's major football club Hellas Verona.]]

The city has two professional [[association football|football]] teams. Historically, the city's major team has been [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]]. They won the Italian [[Serie A]] championship in [[1984-85 Serie A|1984–85]] and played in the [[European Cup]] the following year. [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo Verona]] represented [[Chievo]], a suburb of Verona, and was created in 1929. However, they ceased to exist in 2021 due to outstanding tax payments. As of the 2021–22 season, Hellas plays in the first division of [[Football in Italy|Italian football]], [[Serie A]], while [[Virtus Vecomp Verona|Virtus Verona]], the other club in the city, plays in the [[Serie C]]. The teams of Hellas and Chievo contested the [[Derby della Scala]] and shared the 38,402-seater [[Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi]] (now only home to Hellas due to the fold of Chievo), which was used as a venue at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].

Verona is home to the volleyball team [[Verona Volley]] (now in Serie A1), the rugby team Franklin and Marshall Cus Verona Rugby (now in Serie A1), and the basketball team [[Scaligera Basket Verona|Scaligera Basket]] (now in Legadue).

Verona is hosting the Volleyball Women's World Championship in September–October 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italy2014.fivb.org/en/host%20cities/verona |title=Volleyball Women's World Championship 2014 |publisher=FIVB |access-date=7 July 2014}}</ref>

==Infrastructure and transport==
===Public transit===
[[File:ATV BMB Avancity (1582).jpg|thumb|An ATV bus in Verona]]
Public transit has been operated by the provincial public transport company, ''Azienda Trasporti Verona'' (ATV), since 2007. From 1884 to 1951, the city was served by the {{ill|Verona tram network|it|Rete tranviaria di Verona}}. [[Trolleybus]]es replaced the [[tram]]s which were themselves replaced by buses in 1975. A new trolleybus network is currently under construction by ATV and is expected to open in 2026.<ref name="TM369">''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 369 (May–June 2023), p. 123. National Trolleybus Association (UK). {{issn|0266-7452}}</ref>

An incline lift, the [[Verona funicular]], opened in 2017 and provides access from the [[Ponte Pietra (Verona)|Ponte Pietra]] to the [[Roman theatre, Verona|Roman theatre]] museum and San Pietro Castle.

===Railways===

[[File:Verona italia - panoramio.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Verona Porta Nuova railway station]]]]

Verona lies at a major route crossing where the north–south rail line from the [[Brenner Pass]] to Rome intersects with the east–west line between Milan and Venice, giving the city rail access to most of Europe. In addition to regional and local services, the city is served by direct international trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, and Munich. ÖBB nightjet provides overnight sleeper service via Verona on its La Spezia to Wien and München lines.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nightjet.com/en/reiseziele/italien/verona | title=Verona }}</ref>

Verona's main station is [[Verona Porta Nuova railway station]], to the south of the city center. It is considered to be the ninth busiest railway station in Italy, handling approximately 68,000 passengers per day, or 25 million passengers per year.<ref name=vag>{{cite web | title= Trains to and from Verona Airport (VRN) | work= Italian Airport Guide | url=http://www.italianairportguide.com/vrn/verona-airport-trains.htm | access-date= 9 May 2011 }}</ref>

There is a lesser station to the east of the city at [[Verona Porta Vescovo railway station|Porta Vescovo]], which used to be the main station in Verona, but now only receives trains between Venice and Porta Nuova.
