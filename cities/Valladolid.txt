'''Valladolid''' ({{IPA|es|baʎaðoˈlið|lang|Valladolid.ogg}}) is a [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] in [[Spain]] and the primary seat of government and ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Castile and León]]. It is also the capital of the [[province of Valladolid]]. It has a population of 295,639 people (2022 est.).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Instituto Nacional de Estadística. (Spanish Statistical Institute) |url=https://www.ine.es/nomen2/index.do?accion=busquedaAvanzada&entidad_amb=no&codProv=47&codMuni=186&codEC=0&codES=0&codNUC=0&denominacion_op=like&denominacion_txt=&L=0 |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=www.ine.es}}</ref>

The city is located roughly in the centre of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula's [[Meseta Central]], at the confluence of the [[Pisuerga River|Pisuerga]] and [[Esgueva]] rivers {{cvt|15|km}} before they join the [[Duero]], surrounded by [[winegrowing]] areas. The area was settled in pre-Roman times by the Celtic [[Vaccaei]] people, and then by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] themselves. The settlement was purportedly founded after 1072, growing in prominence within the context of the [[Crown of Castile]], being endowed with [[fair]]s and different institutions such as a collegiate church, [[University of Valladolid|University]] (1241), [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]] and [[Royal Audiencia and Chancillería of Valladolid|Chancellery]] and a royal mint.

Valladolid was the location of [[Valladolid debate|Europe's first moral debate on the treatment of indigenous people]] and is the city in which [[Christopher Columbus]] died. It was briefly the capital of [[Habsburg Spain]] between 1601 and 1606. The city then declined until the arrival of the railway in the 19th century, and with its industrialisation into the 20th century.

The [[old town]] is made up of a variety of historic houses, palaces, churches, plazas, avenues and parks, and includes the [[National Sculpture Museum (Valladolid)|National Museum of Sculpture]] as well as the houses of [[José Zorrilla|Zorrilla]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] which are open as museums. Notably, the city's [[Plaza Mayor, Valladolid|Plaza Mayor]] was the first of its kind in Spain, dating back to the thirteenth century. It was eventually used as a model for similar plazas such as [[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor in Madrid]].

Among the events that are held each year in the city are [[Holy Week in Valladolid|the famous Holy Week]], the [[World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships]], and the Valladolid International Film Festival ([[Seminci]]). In 2019, Valladolid was recognised as a [[City of Film]] as part of [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network]]. Together with another 15 surrounding municipalities, it belongs to an urban community of around 404,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elnortedecastilla.es/20120223/local/valladolid/constituida-comunidad-urbana-valladolid-201202231501.html|website=[[El Norte de Castilla]]|date=23 February 2012|title=Constituida la Comunidad Urbana de Valladolid, que agrupa a la capital y 15 municipios del entorno}}</ref>

== Name ==
There is no direct evidence for the origin of the modern name of Valladolid.

It is mentioned as ''Valledolit'' in the ''[[Estoria de España|Primera Crónica General]]''; earlier documented variants include ''Valledolidi'', ''Valleolide'' (1092) and ''Valleolit'', ''Valleoleti'', ''Valleoliti'' (1095).{{Sfn|Martín Montes|1999|p=162}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}{{dubious|reason=Some are inflected Latinised forms? If so, they should be cited with the context causing the inflection.|date=September 2023}}

One widely held etymological theory suggests that the modern name ''Valladolid'' derives from the [[Celtiberian language]] expression {{lang|xce|Vallis Tolitum}}, meaning "valley of waters", referring to the confluence of rivers in the area. Another theory suggests that the name derives from the Arabic expression ({{langx|ar|بلد الوليد}}, {{lang|ar-Latn|Balad al-Walid}}), which is the [[:ar:بلد الوليد|Arabic exonym currently used]] and means 'city of al-Walid', referring to [[Al-Walid I]].<ref name=" Marín, Manuela 1998">Marín, Manuela et al., eds. 1998. The Formation of Al-Andalus: History and Society. Ashgate. {{ISBN|0-86078-708-7}}</ref><ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], v. 23 The Zenith of the Marwanid House, transl. Martin Hinds, Suny, Albany, 1990</ref> Yet a third claims that it derives from {{lang|la|Vallis Olivetum}}, meaning 'valley of the [[olive]]s'; however, no olive trees are found in that terrain. Instead, innumerable pine trees abound in the south part of the city. The gastronomy reflects the importance of the {{lang|es|piñón}} (pine nut) as a local product, rather than olives. In texts from the [[Middle Ages]] the town is called ''Vallisoletum'', meaning 'sunny valley', and inhabitants are still called today {{lang|es|Vallisoletano}} (male) and {{lang|es|Vallisoletana}} (female).

The city is also popularly called {{lang|es|Pucela}}, a nickname whose origin is not clear, but may refer to knights in the service of [[Joan of Arc]], known as {{lang|fr|La Pucelle}}. Another theory is that {{lang|es|Pucela}} comes from the fact that [[Pozzolana]] cement was sold there, the only city in Spain that sold it.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

[[File:Coordenadas 4.72762W 41.64307N.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35 |Satellite view of Valladolid]]
Valladolid is located at roughly 735 metres above sea level, at the centre of the ''Meseta Norte'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribunasalamanca.com/noticias/por-que-no-nieva-en-valladolid/1522061857|website=Tribuna de Salamanca|title=¿Por qué no nieva en Valladolid?|date=17 November 2019|first=Gloria|last=Cabarga}}</ref> the [[plateau]] drained by the [[Douro|Duero river basin]] covering a major part of the Northwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The primitive urban core was built ''ex novo'' in the 11th century on a small elevation near the confluence of the [[Esgueva]] with the [[Pisuerga]],{{Sfn|Martín Montes|1999|p=162}} on the left-bank of the latter river. The city of Valladolid currently lies on both banks of the Pisuerga, a major right-bank tributary of the Douro.

Besides the main territory on which the city lies, the municipality also includes two exclaves: Navabuena (5,129 [[hectare]]s, hosting the {{ill|Prison of Villanubla|es|Cárcel de Villanubla}}) and El Rebollar (400 hectares).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/349188/0/valladolid/alaska/navabuena/|website=[[20minutos.es]]|title=Valladolid tiene su 'Alaska' situado a 20 kilómetros del centro de la ciudad|date=14 February 2008|first=Daniel|last=Pascual}}</ref>

=== Climate ===

[[File:Valladolid campogrande invierno01 lou.JPG|thumb|left|Winter in the city gardens of [[Campo Grande (Valladolid)|Campo Grande]]]]

The city of Valladolid experiences a continentalized [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csb'') with influences of a [[cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk''). Valladolid's climate features cool and windy winters due to altitude and the inland location of the city. [[Fog]] is very typical in the morning during winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elnortedecastilla.es/valladolid/valladolid-caracteriza-densas-20191227095003-nt.html|website=[[El Norte de Castilla]]|title=La niebla de todos los días. ¿Por qué se produce?|date=27 December 2019|first=Sara|last=Becerro Alonso}}</ref> Winters experience occasional snow and low temperatures below freezing during cold fronts. Valladolid's climate is influenced by the distance from the sea and its higher altitude.

Valladolid is drier than Spain's northern coastal regions, although there is year-round [[precipitation]]. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|433|mm|in|abbr=on}} and the average annual relative humidity is 64%.

The [[Vaccaei]] were a [[Celtic tribe]], the first people documented as a stable presence on the sector of the middle valley of the [[Douro|River Duero]].

Remains of [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and of a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] camp have been excavated near the city. The nucleus of the city was originally located in the area of the current San Miguel y el Rosarillo square and was surrounded by a [[palisade]]. Proofs of the existence of three ancient lines of walls have been found.

During the time of Muslim rule in Spain, the Christian kings moved the population of this region north into more easily defended areas and deliberately created a [[no man's land]] as a buffer zone against further Moorish conquests. The area was captured from the [[Moors]] in the tenth century.

=== Repopulation and growth ===

[[File:Conde Ansúrez y Eylo Círculo de Recreo.jpg|thumb|right|Historicist early 20th century mural painting by [[Eugenio Oliva]], depicting a meeting of Ansúrez, Eylo and other people in Valladolid]]
In 1072 [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] gifted the Lordship of Valladolid to Count [[Pedro Ansúrez]]. Entrusted with the repopulation of the area, Ansúrez led the foundation of Valladolid along with his wife {{ill|Eylo Alfónsez|es|Eylo Alfonso}}.{{Sfn|Martínez Martín|2006|pp=374–375}} By 1084 the project for the foundation of the settlement was already underway.{{Sfn|Martínez Martín|2006|p=375}} Ansúrez built a palace (now lost) and La Antigua church.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Eylo founded three hospitals and the Churches of San Sebastián and San Nicolás.{{Sfn|Martín López|2016|p=123}} Both co-founded the church of Santa María.{{Sfn|Martín López|2016|p=123}} Valladolid was repopulated by people from the lands of [[Carrión de los Condes|Carrión]] and [[Saldaña, Palencia|Saldaña]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180928/452063509039/de-anonimato-a-ciudad-prospera-valladolid-evocara-900-anos-de-su-repoblacion.html|website=[[La Vanguardia]]|title=De anonimato a ciudad próspera, Valladolid evocará 900 años de su repoblación|date=28 September 2018}}</ref>

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Valladolid grew rapidly, favoured by the commercial privileges granted by the kings [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]] and [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== Early modern period ===

In 1469, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] were married in the city; by the 15th century Valladolid was the residence of the [[kings of Castile]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1506, [[Christopher Columbus]] died in Valladolid "still convinced that he had reached the Indies"<ref>Roger Crowley. ''Conquerors: How Portugal Forged the First Global Empire''. NY: Random House, 2015, p. 161</ref> in a house that is now a museum dedicated to him.

From 1554 to 1559, [[Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Joanna of Austria]], sister of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], served as [[regent]], establishing herself in Valladolid,{{Sfn|Caballero Romero|2015|p=81}} with the latter becoming the political center of the [[Habsburg Spain|Hispanic Monarchy]] by that time.{{Sfn|Moreno|2018|pp=181–197}} She favoured the [[Ruy Gómez de Silva|Ebolist Party]], one of the two leading factions of the Court of Philip II, in competition with the ''[[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo y Pimentel|albistas]]''.{{Sfn|Caballero Romero|2015|p=81}} The [[Reformation]] took hold in some parts of the city where Protestant circles appeared presumably around the leading figure of [[Augustino de Cazalla]], an adviser of Joanna.{{Sfn|Moreno|2018|pp=181–197}} Ensuing ''[[Auto-da-fé|autos de fe]]'' against the Protestant sects took place in 1559 in Valladolid.{{Sfn|Moreno|2018|pp=181–197}} A catastrophic fire in 1561 destroyed a portion of the city.{{Sfn|Gutiérrez Alonso|1986|p=11}}

During 1550–1551 the town held the [[Valladolid debate|first moral debate in European history]] to discuss the rights and treatment of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous people]] by conquerors.

Valladolid was granted the status of city in 1596, also becoming a [[bishopric]].{{Sfn|Vega García-Luengos|1997|p=207}}

In the midst of the reign of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], Valladolid briefly served as the capital of the Hispanic Monarchy between 1601 and 1606 under the auspice of the [[Duke of Lerma]], ''[[Favourite|valido]]'' of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]].

The city was again damaged by a flood of the rivers Pisuerga and Esgueva.

=== Contemporary history ===
[[File:Fundación Joaquín Díaz - Paseo Zorrilla - Valladolid.jpg|thumb|left|The Paseo de Zorrilla in the 1970s]]

From 1950 onwards Valladolid became an important industrial centre.{{Sfn|Díez Abad|2004|p=642}} This was the context in which companies such as ENDASA (1950), [[FASA-Renault|FASA]] (1954), TECNAUTO (1956) and [[Sava (Spain)|SAVA]] (1957) were created.{{Sfn|Díez Abad|2004|p=643}} The city was declared as a ''Polo de Desarrollo Industrial'' ("Pole for Industrial Development") in 1964.{{Sfn|Díez Abad|2004|p=643}} During the 1960 and early 1970s the city attracted many immigrants, chiefly coming from the province of Valladolid and neighbouring provinces.{{Sfn|Díez Abad|2004|p=643}} The city started to expand across the western bank of the Pisuerga in the early 1960s.{{Sfn|Ruiz|2013}}

In the context of the fraught process for the creation of the [[autonomous community]] of [[Castile and León]] (completed in 1983), Valladolid vied for the condition of regional capital, competing with other cities, most notably creating a sense of ''antagonism'' with [[Burgos]].{{Sfn|Malveille|2004|p=259}} Although the capital was not explicitly enshrined in the {{ill|Statute of autonomy of Castile and León|es|Estatuto de Autonomía de Castilla y León|lt=region's statute of autonomy}} from 1983,{{Sfn|Calderón Calderón|García Cuesta|2014|p=100}} Valladolid was designated in 1987 as the ''de jure'' seat of the executive and legislative institutions (the [[Junta of Castile and León]] and the [[Cortes of Castile and León]]).{{Sfn|Calderón Calderón|García Cuesta|2014|p=100}}

June 25th 2024, the church de la Vera Cruz built in 1581 broke down, causing dust to encircle the whole city. This accident was supposedly due to renovation works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/spain/el-pais-nacional-1244/20240722/282063397208839|title=|via=PressReader}}</ref>

===Jewish History===
Historically, a [[Jewish community]] existed in Valladolid. There was most likely Jewish life in Valladolid during the Arab period, but the first documentation where Jews are mentioned as living in the city dates to 1221. In 1288, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] prohibited Jews from acquiring land in Valladolid and the surrounding area. In 1322, Christians were prohibited from being treated by Jewish doctors, and could not attend Jewish or Moorish weddings. Furthermore, Jews were barred from positions of public office. In the early 15th century, the Laws of Valladolid were passed, a series of anti-Jewish legislation. These laws stripped the Jews of Valladolid of their autonomy, which included the right to have their own court system. Additionally, Jews and Moors were prohibited from leaving Castille. In 1432, however, officials in Valladolid met with Don Abraham [[Benveniste]] in the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] of the city, and agreed to restore Jewish autonomy. [[Converso]] poet [[Juan de Valladolid]] wrote poems criticizing treatment of Jews in Valladolid.<ref>{{cite web |title=Valladolid |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/valladolid |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref> Jewish life in Valladolid was nonexistent in the 16th century, after the [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|expulsion of the Jews]].

After new neighbourhoods developed in recent decades (one example would be [[Covaresa]]), the high prices in the municipality led young people to buy properties in towns around the city, so the population has fallen in Valladolid but is growing fast in other peri-urban areas (for example, [[Arroyo de la Encomienda]] or [[Zaratán]]).

Valladolid is a major economic center in Spain. The [[Automotive industry in Spain|automotive industry]] is one of the major motors of the city's economy since the founding of [[FASA-Renault]] in 1953 for the assembling of [[Renault]]-branded vehicles, which would later become [[Renault España]]. Four years later, in 1957, [[Sava (Spain)|Sava]] was founded and started producing commercial vehicles. Sava would later be absorbed by [[Pegaso]] and since 1990 by the Italian truck manufacturer [[Iveco]]. Together with the French tire manufacturer [[Michelin]], Renault and Iveco form the most important industrial companies of the city.

Besides the automotive and automotive auxiliary industries, other important industrial sectors are [[food processing]] (with local companies like Acor and Queserías Entrepinares and facilities of multinationals like [[Cadbury]], [[Lactalis]] or Lesaffre), [[metallurgy]] (Lingotes Especiales, Saeta die Casting...), chemical and printing. In total 22 013 people were employed in 2007 in industrial workplaces, representing 14.0% of total workers.<ref name="CE">Data from [http://www.cajaespana.es/pubweb/decyle.nsf/9C21FF15F589D493C12578720023B41F/$File/47186.PDF?OpenElement Informe de Datos Económicos y Sociales de los Municipios de España] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081938/http://www.cajaespana.es/pubweb/decyle.nsf/9C21FF15F589D493C12578720023B41F/$File/47186.PDF?OpenElement |date=7 April 2014 }}, written by Caja España</ref>

The main economic sector of Valladolid in terms of employment is however the service sector, which employs 111,988 people, representing 74.2% of Valladolid workers affiliated to Social Security.

The construction sector employed 15,493 people in 2007, representing 10.3% of total workers.

Finally, agriculture is a tiny sector in the city which only employs 2,355 people (1.5% of the total). The predominant crops are wheat, [[barley]] and [[sugar beet]].

Top 10 companies by turnover in 2013 in € million were: [[Renault]] (4 596), [[Michelin]] (2 670), [[IVECO]] (1 600), the Valladolid-based supermarket chain [[Grupo El Árbol]] (849), cheese processing [[Queserías Entrepinares]] (204), sugar processing [[Acor]] (201), service group [[Grupo Norte]] (174), automobile auxiliary company [[Faurecia]]-Asientos de Castilla y León (143), Sada (129) and Hipereco (108).<ref>''Castilla y León Económica'', no. 211, February 2013</ref>

== Transportation ==

{{more citations needed|date=July 2020}}

=== Public transport ===

Urban [[public transport|transit system]] was based on the [[Valladolid tram]] network from 1881 to 1933. A public urban bus system started in 1928, managed by different private tenders until 1982, when the service was taken over by the municipality. Today the public company AUVASA operates the network, with 22 regular lines and 5 late night lines.

=== High-speed rail ===

[[File:Avant. Estación Campo-Grande (Valladolid).jpg|thumb|right|Avant train stationed at [[Valladolid-Campo Grande railway station|Valladolid-Campo Grande]]]]
[[Valladolid-Campo Grande railway station]] is integrated into the Spanish high-speed network [[AVE]]. The [[Madrid–Valladolid high-speed rail line]] was inaugurated on 22 December 2007. The line links both cities, crossing the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] through [[Guadarrama Tunnel|the namesake tunnel]], the fourth longest train tunnel in Europe. Valladolid will become the hub for all AVE lines connecting the north and north-west of Spain with the rest of the country. Trainsets used on this line include S-114 (max speed 250&nbsp;km/h (155&nbsp;mph)), S-130 (Patito, max speed 250&nbsp;km/h (155&nbsp;mph)) and the S102 (Pato, max speed 320&nbsp;km/h or 199&nbsp;mph). This line connects the city with [[Madrid]], which can be reached in 56 minutes.

=== Roads ===

Several highways connect the city to the rest of the country.

=== Airport ===

{{Main|Valladolid Airport}}
The airport serving the city is not located within the municipal limits, but in [[Villanubla]]. The airport has connections to [[Barcelona]], [[Málaga]], and the [[Canary Islands]].

== Culture ==
{{more citations needed|date=July 2020}}

=== Languages ===
[[File:Casacervantes academia artes01 lou.jpg|thumb|right|[[Casa de Cervantes]] ("Cervantes' House")]]
Spanish is the only official language throughout the city. Valladolid stands out for having been the residence of the author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Miguel de Cervantes]], as well as authors such as [[José Zorrilla]] or [[Miguel Delibes]] and the thrust of its [[University of Valladolid|University]]. The province stands out for receiving a significant number of people who want to learn the Spanish language ([[Cultural tourism|Language tourism]]).

=== Easter ===

{{main|Holy Week in Valladolid}}
[[File:Valladolid cofradia Siete palabas procesion lou.jpg|thumb|right|Holy Week procession in the city]]
[[Holy Week]] ("Semana Santa" in Spanish) holds one of the best known Catholic traditions in Valladolid. The [[Good Friday]] processions are considered an exquisite and rich display of Castilian religious sculpture. On this day, in the morning, members of the brotherhoods on horseback make a poetic proclamation throughout the city. The "Sermon of the Seven Words" is spoken in Plaza Mayor Square. In the afternoon, thousands of people take part in the Passion Procession, comprising 31 pasos (religious statues), most of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The last statue in the procession is the [[Illustrious Penitential Brotherhood of Our Lady of Anguish|Virgen de las Angustias]], and her return to the church is one of the most emotional moments of the celebrations, with the Salve Popular sung in her honour.

Easter is one of the most spectacular and emotional fiestas in Valladolid. Religious devotion, art, colour and music combine in acts to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ: the processions. Members of the different Easter brotherhoods, dressed in their characteristic robes, parade through the streets carrying religious statues (pasos) to the sound of drums and music.

=== Seminci ===

{{main|Seminci}}
[[Image:Teatro Calderon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Teatro Calderón (Valladolid)|Calderón Theatre]] is the festival headquarters.]]
The city is also host to one of the foremost (and oldest) international film festivals, the ''Semana Internacional de Cine de Valladolid ([[Seminci]])'', founded in 1956. Valladolid, through various loopholes in state censorship, was able to present films that would otherwise have been impossible to see in Spain. An award or an enthusiastic reception from the audience and the critics meant, on numerous occasions{{specify|date=March 2020}}, that the official state bodies gave the go-ahead to certain films which Francisco Franco's regime considered out of line with their ideology.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Even after the death of Franco in 1975, Valladolid continued to be the "testing ground" for films which had been banned. For example, the premiere in Spain of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' at the 1975 festival is still recalled as a landmark.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

=== Local cuisine ===

{{Main|Cuisine of the province of Valladolid}}
[[File:Plato de lechazo, Valladolid.jpg|thumb|The roasted ''[[lechazo]]'' (unweaned lamb) is a staple of the provincial cuisine.]]
[[File:Barricas Bodega Viña Sastre - Hermanos Sastre Ribera del Duero Spain.JPG|thumb|''Hermanos Sastre'' wine cellar]]
Although an inland province, fish is commonly consumed, some brought from the [[Bay of Biscay|Cantabrian Sea]]. Fish like red bream and [[hake]] are a major part of Valladolid's cuisine.

The main speciality of Valladolid is, however, lechazo (suckling baby lamb). The lechazo is slowly roasted in a wood oven and served with salad.

Valladolid also offers a great assortment of wild mushrooms. Asparagus, endive and beans can also be found. Some legumes, like white beans and lentils are particularly good. Pine nuts are also produced in great quantities.

Sheep cheese from Villalón de Campos, the famous [[pata de mulo cheese|pata de mulo]] (mule's foot) is usually unripened (fresh), but if it is cured the ripening process brings out such flavour that it can compete with the best sheep cheeses in Spain.

Valladolid has a bread to go with every dish, like the delicious cuadros from Medina del Campo, the muffins, the pork-scratching bread and the lechuguinos, with a pattern of concentric circles that resemble a head of lettuce.

The pastries and baked goods from the province of Valladolid are well-known, specially St. Mary's ring-shaped pastries, St. Claire's sponge cakes, pine nut balls and cream fritters.

Valladolid is also a producer of wines. The ones that fall under the Designation of Origin [[Cigales]] are very good. White wines from [[Rueda (DO)|Rueda]] and red wines from [[Ribera del Duero]] are known for their quality.
