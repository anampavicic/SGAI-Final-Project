== Etymology ==
=== Anfa ===
Before the 15th century, the settlement at what is now Casablanca had been called ''Anfa'', rendered in European sources variously as El-Anfa, Anafa or Anaffa, Anafe, Anife, Anafee, Nafe, and Nafee.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book |last=André |first=Adam |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/479295174 |title=Histoire de Casablanca '(des origines à 1914) '. |date=1969 |publisher=Ophrys |pages=14–17 |oclc=479295174 |access-date=2021-04-02 |archive-date=2021-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210316193332/https://www.worldcat.org/title/histoire-de-casablanca-des-origines-a-1914/oclc/479295174 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Ibn Khaldun]] ascribed the name to the ''Anfaça'', a branch of the {{Interlanguage link|Auréba|ar|أوربة}} tribe of the [[Maghreb]], though the sociologist [[André Adam (academic)|André Adam]] refuted this claim due to the absence of the third syllable.<ref name=":6" /> [[Nahum Slouschz]] gave a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] etymology, citing the ''Lexicon'' of [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]: ''anâphâh'' (a type of bird) or ''anaph'' (face, figure), though Adam refuted this arguing that even a [[Berber Jews|Judaized population]] would still have spoken [[Berber languages|Tamazight]].<ref name=":6" /> Adam also refuted an [[Arabic]] etymology, {{Lang|ar|أنف}} (''anf'', "nose"), as the city predated the linguistic [[Arabization]] of the country, and the term ''anf'' was not used to describe geographic areas.<ref name=":6" /> Adam affirmed a Tamazight etymology—from ''anfa'' "hill", ''anfa'' "promontory on the sea", ''ifni'' "sandy beach", or ''anfa'' "threshing floor"—although he determined the available information insufficient to establish exactly which.<ref name=":6" />

The name "Anfa" was used in maps until around 1830—in some until 1851—which Adam attributes to the tendency of cartographers to replicate previous maps.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=André.|first=Adam|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/479295174|title=Histoire de Casablanca '(des origines à 1914) '.|date=1969|publisher=Ophrys|pages=67–68|oclc=479295174|access-date=2021-04-02|archive-date=2021-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210316193332/https://www.worldcat.org/title/histoire-de-casablanca-des-origines-a-1914/oclc/479295174|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Casablanca ===
[[File:ضريح علال القيرواني 1915.jpg|thumb|The [[Mausoleum of Allal al-Qairawani]], which local legend associates with the naming of Casablanca.<ref name=":7" />]]
When Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] ({{circa|1710}}–1790) rebuilt the city after its destruction in the [[1755 Meknes earthquake|earthquake of 1755]], it was renamed "''ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʾ'' " ({{Lang|ar|الدار البيضاء}} ''The White House''), though in [[Moroccan Arabic|vernacular]] use it was pronounced "''Dar al-Baiḍā''" ({{Lang|ar|دار البيضاء}} literally ''House of the White,'' although in [[Moroccan Arabic]] vernacular it retains the original sense of ''The White House'').<ref name=":7" />

The origins of the name "Casablanca" are unclear, although several theories have been suggested. [[André Adam (academic)|André Adam]] mentions the legend of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint and merchant [[Allal al-Qairawani]], who supposedly came from [[Tunisia]] and settled in Casablanca with his wife Lalla al-Baiḍāʾ ({{Lang|ar|لالة البيضاء}} ''White Lady'').<ref name=":7" /> The villagers of [[Mediouna, Morocco|Mediouna]] would reportedly provision themselves at "Dar al-Baiḍāʾ" ({{Lang|ar|دار البيضاء}} ''House of the White'').<ref name=":7" />

In fact, on a low hill slightly inland above the [[ruins of Anfa]] and just to the west of today's city centre, it appears there was a [[white-washed]] structure, possibly a Sufi [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]] that acted as a landmark to sailors.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Deroy |first=Louis |title=Dictionnaire des noms de lieux |publisher=Dictionnaires Le Robert |year=1994 |isbn=2-85036-195-X |location=France |pages=94 |language=FR}}</ref> The Portuguese cartographer [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Duarte Pacheco]] wrote in the early 16th century that the city could easily be identified by a tower, and nautical guides from the late 19th century still mentioned a "white tower" as a point of reference.<ref name=":7" /> The Portuguese mariners [[calque]]d the modern Arabic name to "Casa Branca" ({{IPA|pt|kazɐ'bɾɐ̃kɐ|}} ''White House'') in place of Anfa.<ref name=":7" /> The name "Casablanca" was then a [[calque]] of the Portuguese name when the Spanish took over trade through the [[Iberian Union]].<ref name=":7" />

During the [[French protectorate in Morocco]], the name remained Casablanca ({{IPA|fr|kazablɑ̃ka|pron}}). Today, Moroccans still call the city Casablanca or ''Casa'' for short, or by its Arabic name, pronounced {{Transliteration|ary|d-Dār l-Biḍā}} in Moroccan Arabic or {{Transliteration|arb|ad-Dāru-l-Bayḍā'}} in [[Standard Arabic]].<ref name=":8">{{Cite book |last=Hachimi |first=Atiqa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_aSAgAAQBAJ |title=Arabic in the City: Issues in Dialect Contact and Language Variation |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-135-97876-1 |editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Catherine |pages=100 |language=en |chapter=Becoming Casablancan: Fessis in Casablanca as a case study |quote=However, in the sixteenth century the Portuguese decided to come back to the area and settle in it permanently. They built the city and named it ''Casa Branca'' "the white house". In 1755, the Portuguese abandoned the city after an earthquake that destroyed it completely. After the departure of the Portuguese, Casablanca remained deserted until the Alaouite Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah rebuilt it near the end of the eighteenth century. He renamed it ''Addaru lbayḍaʔ'', which is the literal Arabic translation for ''Casa Branca''. The city acquired its Spanish name ''Casa Blanca'' when Spanish companies established themselves in the city in 1781. Today the city is known by its Standard Arabic name ''addaru lbayḍaʔ'', and ''d-dar(l)biḍa'' in Moroccan Arabic, as well as ''Casablanca'' or ''Casa'' for short. |editor-last2=Al-Wer |editor-first2=Enam |editor-last3=Caubet |editor-first3=Dominique |editor-last4=Watson |editor-first4=Janet C.

In the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and [[privateers]]. The Portuguese consequently bombarded the town into ruins in 1468.<ref name="Britain)1987">{{cite book|title=Guide to places of the world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQ9dAAAAMAAJ|access-date=22 April 2012|date=April 1987|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|page=133|isbn = 9780276398261}}</ref> The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning "white house" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

The town was finally rebuilt between 1756 and 1790 by [[Sultan]] [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]], the grandson of [[Moulay Ismail]] and an ally of [[George Washington]], with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ''ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʼ'' (الدار البيضاء), the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation of the Portuguese ''Casa Branca''.

=== Colonial struggle ===

In the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing [[gunpowder tea]], used in Morocco's national drink, [[Maghrebi mint tea|mint tea]]).<ref name="Srhir2005">{{cite book|last=Srhir|first=Khalid Ben|title=Britain And Morocco During The Embassy Of John Drummond Hay, 1845–1886|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Wf_Av7-hIoC&pg=PA126|access-date=22 April 2012|date=19 April 2005|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=978-0-7146-5432-4|page=126}}</ref> By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s.<ref>Pennel, CR: ''Morocco from Empire to Independence'', Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 121</ref> Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of [[French colonial empires|French colonialists]] in 1906.

==== Bombardment of Casablanca ====
The [[Algeciras Conference|Treaty of Algeciras]] of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company ''[[Compagnie Marocaine|La Compagnie Marocaine]]'' would develop the [[port of Casablanca]], and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Adam |first=André |title=Histoire de Casablanca, des origines à 1914 |publisher=Éditions Ophrys |year=1968 |pages=107}}</ref>

To build the port's breakwater, [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] track was laid in June 1907 for a small [[Decauville]] locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in [[Roches Noires, Morocco|Roches Noires]], passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the [[Chaouia (Morocco)|Chaouia]] attacked the locomotive, killing 9 [[Compagnie Marocaine]] laborers—3 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Adam |first=André |title=Histoire de Casablanca, des origines à 1914 |publisher=Éditions Ophrys |year=1968 |pages=112}}</ref>

In response, the French [[Bombardment of Casablanca (1907)|bombarded the city]] in August 1907 with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and killing between 600 and 3,000 Moroccans.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hachim |first=Mouna |author-link=Mouna Hachim |date=April 2020 |title=Casablanca, mon amour: Il y a 100 ans, le bombardement...

Right at the beginning of the twentieth century when [[Morocco]] was officially declared a French protectorate, the French decided to shift power to Morocco's coastal areas (i.e. [[Rabat]] and Casablanca) at the expense of its interior areas (i.e. Fez and Marrakech). Rabat was made the administrative capital of the country and Casablanca its economic capital.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/154677539 |title=Arabic in the city: issues in dialect contact and language variation |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-77311-9 |editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Catherine |series=Routledge Arabic linguistics series |location=London; New York |oclc=154677539 |quote=Rabat was made the administrative capital of the country and Casablanca its economic capital.}}</ref>

General [[Hubert Lyautey]] assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to [[Henri Prost]]. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ''ville nouvelle'' outside the walls of the [[Medina quarter|medina]]. In Casablanca, he also designed a new "''[[Hubous (Casablanca)|ville indigène]]''" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hodebert|first=Laurent|title="Laprade et Prost, du Maroc à Génissiat, du sol des villes aux édifices", journal de l'exposition "De la construction au récit" au CAUE 74|url=https://www.academia.edu/26035381|journal=Journal de l'exposition de la construction au récit, être de son temps et de son lieu pour l'architecture du XXe siècle|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-date=2021-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003030718/https://www.academia.edu/26035381|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== World War II ===
{{Further|Operation Torch}}
After [[Philippe Pétain]] of [[French Third Republic|France]] signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice]] with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], he ordered French troops in [[French colonial empire|France's colonial empire]] to defend French territory against any aggressors—[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] or otherwise—applying a policy of "asymmetrical neutrality" in favour of the Germans.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98JmAAAAMAAJ&q=%22neutralit%C3%A9+dissym%C3%A9trique%22+petain|title=Relations internationales Paris|date=2001|publisher=Société d'études historiques des relations internationales contemporaines|pages=358|language=fr}}</ref> French colonists in Morocco generally supported Pétain, while Moroccans tended to favour [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of modern Morocco|last=Miller|first=Susan Gilson|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139624695|location=New York|pages=142|oclc=855022840}}</ref>

[[Operation Torch]], which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of [[French North Africa]] during the North African campaign of [[World War II]]. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George S. Patton]] and [[Rear Admiral]] [[Henry Kent Hewitt]], carried out the invasions of [[Kenitra|Mehdia]], [[Mohammedia|Fedhala]], and [[Safi, Morocco|Asfi]]. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered 11 November 1942, but the [[Naval Battle of Casablanca]] continued until American forces sank [[German submarine U-173]] on 16 November.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/nmusn/explore/photography/wwii/wwii-north-africa-campaign/naval-battle-of-casablanca.html|title=1942: November 8-16: Naval Battle of Casablanca|website=NHHC|language=en-US|access-date=13 July 2019}}</ref>

Casablanca was the site of the Berrechid Airfield, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the [[European Theatre of Operations]] during World War II. The airfield has since become [[Mohammed V International Airport]].

==== Anfa Conference ====
{{Main|Casablanca Conference}}
Casablanca hosted the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Anfa Conference]] (also called the [[Casablanca Conference]]) in January 1943. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the [[Free France]] generals [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Henri Giraud]], though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.

It was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of "unconditional surrender", meaning that the [[Axis powers]] would be fought until their defeat. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] also met privately with Sultan [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammad V]] and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A history of modern Morocco|last=Miller|first=Susan Gilson|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139624695|location=New York|pages=144|oclc=855022840}}</ref> This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.<ref name=":0" />

=== Toward independence ===
During the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.

On 7 April 1947, a [[Massacre of April 7, 1947|massacre]] of working class Moroccans, carried out by [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]] in the service of the [[Troupes coloniales|French colonial army]], was instigated just as Sultan [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammed V]] was due to make a speech in [[Tangier]] appealing for independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasinfo.fr/Evenements-du-7-avril-1947-a-Casablanca-un-tournant-decisif-dans-la-lutte-pour-la-liberte-et-l-independance_a70631.html|title=Evènements du 7 avril 1947 à Casablanca, un tournant décisif dans la lutte pour la liberté et l'indépendance|website=Atlasinfo.fr: l'essentiel de l'actualité de la France et du Maghreb|date=6 April 2016|language=fr|access-date=29 August 2019|archive-date=29 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829112737/https://www.atlasinfo.fr/Evenements-du-7-avril-1947-a-Casablanca-un-tournant-decisif-dans-la-lutte-pour-la-liberte-et-l-independance_a70631.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Casablanca Uprisings of 1952|Riots]] in Casablanca took place from 7–8 December 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist [[Farhat Hached]] by ''[[La Main Rouge]]''—the clandestine militant wing of [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|French intelligence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yabiladi.com/articles/details/49006/decembre-1952-quand-casablancais-sont.html|title=7-8 décembre 1952 : Quand les Casablancais se sont soulevés contre l'assassinat de Ferhat Hached|website=www.yabiladi.com|language=fr|access-date=16 March 2019|archive-date=8 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181208131932/https://www.yabiladi.com/articles/details/49006/decembre-1952-quand-casablancais-sont.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), [[Muhammad Zarqtuni]] orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's [[Central Market (Casablanca)|Central Market]] in response to the forced exile of Sultan [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammad V]] and the royal family on 20 August ([[Eid al-Adha]]) of that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1953/12/25/archives/16-dead-in-casablanca-blast.html|title=16 Dead in Casablanca Blast|date=25 December 1953|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=4 October 2010|url-access=subscription|archive-date=5 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105145032/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C12FF3E59177B93C7AB1789D95F478585F9&scp=3&sq=casablanca+bomb&st=p|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Since independence ===
Morocco gained independence from France in 1956. The post-independence era witnessed significant urban transformations and socio-economic shifts, particularly in neighborhoods like Hay Mohammadi, which were deeply impacted by neoliberal policies and state-led urban redevelopment projects.<ref>Strava, C. (2021). Precarious modernities: Assembling State, Space and Society on the Urban Margins in Morocco. Bloomsbury Publishing. P. 3</ref>

==== Casablanca Group ====
On 4–7 January 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the [[Casablanca Group|Casablanca Conference of 1961]].

The [[1965 Moroccan riots|1965 student protests]] organized by the [[National Union of Popular Forces]]-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on 22 March 1965, in front of [[Lycée Mohammed V]] in Casablanca.<ref name="Brousky20052">Par Omar Brouksy, "[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/LIN20035quesesramel0/ Que s'est-il vraiment passé le 23 mars 1965?]", ''Jeune Afrique'', 21 March 2005.

=== Climate ===

Casablanca has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). The cool [[Canary Current]] off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal [[Los Angeles]], with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to {{convert|412|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are {{convert|40.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-2.7|°C|1|abbr=on}}, respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is {{convert|178|mm|1|abbr=on}} on 30 November 2010.

Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Casablanca is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], Casablanca, [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]) which would be the most severely affected by future [[sea level rise]]. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.<ref>Trisos, C.H., I.O.

{{Main|Economy of Casablanca}}

The [[Grand Casablanca]] region is considered the locomotive of the development of the [[Economy of Morocco|Moroccan economy]]. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of [[industrial labor]]. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93&nbsp;billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27&nbsp;billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casainvest.ma/casainvest/tabid/55/Default.aspx |title=Les bonnes raisons d'investir à Casablanca |publisher=Casainvest.ma |access-date=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170400/https://www.casainvest.ma/casainvest/tabid/55/Default.aspx |archive-date=22 July 2011 }}</ref>

One of the most important exports of Casablanca is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topbladi.com/villes/casablanca.htm |title=Casablanca, capitale economique du Maroc |publisher=Topbladi.com |access-date=17 April 2011 |archive-date=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128143806/http://topbladi.com/villes/casablanca.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Port of Casablanca|Casablanca]] and [[Mohammedia]] seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of [[Morocco Mall]], as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park was also renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casainvest.ma/ |title=votre partenaire pour investir à Casablanca au Maroc |publisher=CasaInvest.ma |access-date=28 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903030342/http://www.casainvest.ma/ |archive-date=3 September 2011 }}</ref>

=== Judaism in Casablanca ===
[[File:Inside Bet El synagogue Casablanca (926173377).jpg|thumb|left|Inside [[Temple Beth-El (Casablanca)|Temple Beth-El]] in Casablanca]]
Jews have a [[History of Moroccan Jews|long history]] in Casablanca. A [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic Jewish]] community was in [[Anfa]] up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah [[synagogue]] was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].<ref name=JVL/>

[[Raja CA]], founded in 1949, compete in [[Botola]] and play their home games at the [[Stade Mohammed V]]. The club is known for their supporters and is one of the most supported teams in Africa. [[Wydad AC]], founded in 1937, also compete in Botola and play their home games at the [[Stade Mohammed V]]. Both have a strong reputation on continental competitions, having both won the [[CAF Champions League]] three times.

The [[Hassan II Stadium]] is the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2025, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of [[Raja Casablanca]], [[Wydad Casablanca]], and the [[Morocco national football team]]. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the [[Stade Mohamed V]]. The initial idea of the stadium was for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], for which Morocco lost their bid to [[South Africa]]. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], for which Morocco lost their bid to [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and [[United States]]. It will now host the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]] which Morocco will co-host with two European nations [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].

During the [[French Protectorate in Morocco|French Protectorate]], the French government described Casablanca as a "laboratory of urbanism".<ref>{{Cite web|work=Pages Magazine|title=Contact Zones|url=https://pagesmagazine.net/en/articles/contact-zones/58cbd1fabf07dc00b19b0b8c|access-date=3 July 2020|language=en|archive-date=14 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210914002811/https://pagesmagazine.net/en/articles/contact-zones/58cbd1fabf07dc00b19b0b8c|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Air ===
[[File:Royal Air Maroc Boeing 747-400 CN-RGA CMN 2006-6-5.png|left|thumb|[[Mohammed V International Airport]] is the [[Airline hub|hub]] of the [[Flag carrier|national airline]] of Morocco, [[Royal Air Maroc]].]]
Casablanca's main airport is [[Mohammed V International Airport]], Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], [[Agadir]], [[Oujda]], [[Tangier]], Al Hoceima, and [[Laayoune]], as well as other cities.

Casablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. [[New York City]], [[Montreal]], [[Paris]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[London]] and [[Dubai]] are important primary destinations.

The older, smaller [[Casablanca-Anfa Airport]] to the west of the city, served certain destinations including [[Damascus]] and [[Tunis]], and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It was eventually demolished to make way for construction of the "[[Casablanca Finance City]]", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. [[Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport]] is located in the nearby community of [[Tit Mellil]].

=== Coach buses ===
''[[Compagnie de Transports au Maroc]]'' ([[Compagnie de Transports au Maroc|CTM]]) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the [[Central Market (Casablanca)|Central Market]] in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of [[ONCF]], also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supratours.ma/en/|title=Page d'accueil|website=www.supratours.ma|access-date=1 March 2020|archive-date=26 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226093026/http://www.supratours.ma/en/|url-status=live}}</ref> There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the [[Wilad Zian Bus Station]]; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/casablanca/transport/getting-there-away/land|title=Land transport in Casablanca|last=Planet|first=Lonely|website=Lonely Planet|language=en|access-date=1 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301093209/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/casablanca/transport/getting-there-away/land|archive-date=1 March 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hespress.com/regions/445016.html|title=مشاكل "محطة أولاد زيان" تشغل جماعة البيضاء|website=Hespress|date=22 September 2019|language=ar|access-date=1 March 2020|archive-date=1 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301093206/https://www.hespress.com/regions/445016.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Taxis ===
{{See also|Taxis of Morocco}}
[[File:Grand Taxi in Centre Ville Casablanca.jpg|thumb|A grand taxi of Casablanca parked on Rue Chaouia]]
Registered [[Taxicab|taxis]] in Casablanca are coloured red and known as ''petits taxis'' (small taxis), or coloured white and known as ''grands taxis'' (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, ''petits taxis'', typically small-four door [[Dacia Logan]], [[Peugeot 207]], or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. ''Grands taxis'', generally older [[Mercedes-Benz]] sedans, provide shared [[mini-bus]] like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. ''Grands taxis'' may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.

=== Trains ===
Casablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the [[ONCF]].

[[File:الطرامواي أمام محطة الدار البيضاء المسافري.jpeg|thumb|left|A tram on Casablanca's T1 line passes in front of [[Casa-Voyageurs railway station]]]]{{stnlnk|Casa-Voyageurs}} is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to [[Marrakech]] or [[El Jadida]] and north to [[Mohammedia]] and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or [[Meknes]], [[Fes]], Taza and [[Oujda]]/[[Nador]]. It also serves as the southern terminus of the [[Al-Boraq]] high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to [[Mohammed V International Airport]] also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.
{{stnlnk|Casa-Port}} serves primarily commuter trains such as the [[Train Navette Rapide]] (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca – [[Kenitra]] rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark [[Casablanca Twin Center]]. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the [[Casablanca Tramway|city's new tram network]].

[[Oasis railway station|Casa-Oasis]] was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.

* The 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in [[Los Angeles]] and does not feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role.<ref>{{cite AV media|author1=Epstein, Julius J. |author2=Epstein, Philip G. |author3=Koch, Howard |author4=Burnett, Murray |author5=Alison, Joan |author6=Edeson, Arthur |author7=Steiner, Max |author8=Curtiz, Michael |author9=Bogart, Humphrey |author10=Bergman, Ingrid |author11=Henreid, Paul|title=Casablanca|date=2015|publisher=Menart Records|oclc=922863437}}</ref> The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of power struggle between various foreign powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://legation.ipower.com/blog/?p=270|title=When Tangier Was Casablanca: Rick's Café & Dean's Bar|date=21 October 2011|website=Tangier American Legation|language=en-US|access-date=21 May 2019|archive-date=27 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727090633/https://legation.ipower.com/blog/?p=270|url-status=live}}</ref> The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], it won three, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].
*''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946) was the 12th [[Marx Brothers]]' movie. The film stars [[Groucho Marx]], [[Chico Marx]], and [[Harpo Marx]]. It was directed by [[Archie Mayo]] and written by [[Joseph Fields]] and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song "[[Who's Sorry Now? (song)|Who's Sorry Now?]]", with music by [[Ted Snyder]] and lyrics by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]]. It is sung in French by [[Lisette Verea]] playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s "[[Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2]]" is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the "[[Beer Barrel Polka]]", and again by Harpo on the harp.
* The city is featured in ''[[The Mysterious Caravan]]'' (1975), volume 54 in the original [[The Hardy Boys|Hardy Boys]] series.
* Casablanca is the setting for several chapters in ''[[Doubleshot]]'', a 2000 [[James Bond]] novel by [[Raymond Benson]]. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.
* Casablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game ''[[Dreamfall]]'', as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, [[Zoë Castillo]], lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.
* Casablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film ''[[Allied (film)|Allied]]'' starring [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Marion Cotillard]].
