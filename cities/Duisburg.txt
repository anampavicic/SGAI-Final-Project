'''Duisburg''' ({{IPA|de|ˈdyːsbʊʁk|lang|Duisburg.ogg}}; {{langx|nds|Duisborg}}, {{IPA-nds|ˈdʏsbɔɐ̯χ|pron}}) is a city in the [[Ruhr]] metropolitan area of the western German [[States of Germany|state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Lying on the confluence of the [[Rhine]] ([[Lower Rhine]]) and the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] rivers in the center of the [[Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region|Rhine-Ruhr Region]], Duisburg is the 5th largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia and the [[List of cities in Germany by population|15th-largest city in Germany]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], it was a [[city-state]] and a member of the [[Hanseatic League]], and later became a major centre of the iron, steel, and chemicals industries. For this reason, it was heavily bombed in [[World War II]]. Today it boasts the world's largest [[inland port]], with 21 docks and 40 kilometres of wharf.

==Status==
Duisburg is a city in Germany's [[Rhineland]], the fifth-largest city (after [[Cologne]], Düsseldorf, [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]]) in the nation's most populous federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Its 500,000 inhabitants make it Germany's [[List of cities in Germany by population|15th-largest city]]. Located at the confluence of the [[Rhine]] river and its [[tributary]] the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr river]], it lies in the west of the [[Ruhr]] urban area, Germany's largest, of which it is the third-largest city after Dortmund and Essen. The Ruhr itself lies within the larger [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]], one of Europe's largest conurbations. The city lies on both sides of the Rhine, with the city centre and most boroughs on the river's right bank, and is the only city of the Rhine-Ruhr region lying on both the Rhine and Ruhr rivers. Duisburg is one of the largest cities in the [[Meuse-Rhenish]] (closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) dialect area and the largest in the Kleverlandish area (north of the [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen Isogloss]]).

Duisburg has the world's largest [[inland port]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtW1qDz574MC&pg=PA12 |title=The Rhine: An Eco-Biography, 18152000 |first=Mark |last=Cioc |date=17 November 2009 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |isbn=9780295989785 |access-date=11 December 2016 |via=Google Books}}</ref> "Duisburg-Ruhrorter Häfen", in Duisburg-[[Ruhrort]]. Germany's third-largest and the Rhine-Ruhr region's main airport, [[Düsseldorf Airport]], lies near the city, in [[Düsseldorf-Lohausen]]. With 42,747 students, the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] is Germany's ninth-largest university. It has campuses in Essen and Duisburg, and a [[university hospital]] in Essen. Duisburg is a result of numerous incorporations of surrounding towns and smaller cities. The city is renowned for its [[Steelmaking|steel industry]]. All [[blast furnace]]s in the Ruhr are now located in Duisburg. In 2000, 49% of all hot metal and 34.4% of all [[pig iron]] in Germany were produced here. It also has a large brewery, [[König Brauerei|König]]. In the early Middle Ages, it was a royal court of the Franks, first mentioned in writing in 883.

== Geography ==
Duisburg is in the Lowland Rhine area at the confluence of the Rhine and Ruhr and near the outskirts of the [[Bergisches Land]]. The city spreads along both sides of these rivers.

=== State Landtag ===
In the [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia]], Duisburg is divided between three constituencies: 61 Duisburg I (containing Süd district and most of Mitte), 62 Duisburg II (Walsum, Rheinhausen, and most of Homberg/Ruhrort/Baerl), and 63 Duisburg III (Hamborn, Meiderich/Beeck, and parts of Mitte and Homberg/Ruhrort/Baerl). After the [[2022 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]], all three constituencies were held by the SPD. Duisburg I was represented by Sarah Philipp, Duisburg II by Rainer Bischoff, and Duisburg III by Frank Börner.

=== Federal parliament ===
In the [[Bundestag]], Duisburg is divided between two constituencies: 115 Duisburg I (Rheinhausen, Süd, and Mitte) and 116 Duisburg II (Walsum, Hamborn, Meidereich/Beeck, Homberg/Ruhrort/Baerl). In the [[List of members of the 20th Bundestag|20th Bundestag]], both are held by the SPD. Duisburg I is represented by [[President of the Bundestag]] [[Bärbel Bas]], and Duisburg II by [[Mahmut Özdemir]].

== History ==
{{for timeline|Timeline of Duisburg}}
The first syllable of the name of the city could go back to the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*dʰeus-'', meaning something like "wet area" or "flood plain".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Duisburg therefore could mean "fortified place in the floodplain". Another interpretation assumes that the name is derived from the Old German "duis" which means "hill".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Duisburg could mean something like "castle on the hill". Thus, a place on a hill overlooking the Rhine, that could refer to the area of the present Town Hall. Duisburggau (Diuspurgau) was also the name of the medieval [[Gau (country subdivision)]] on the Lower Rhine.

A legend recorded by [[Johannes Aventinus]] (fl. 1525) holds that Duisburg (along with [[Deutz, Cologne]], Duisdorf in [[Bonn]], and [[Doesburg]] in the Netherlands, all on the Rhine's right bank) was built by the namesake [[Tuisto]], mythical progenitor of Germans, ca. 2395&nbsp;BC. There is nothing to establish any historical basis for such an early founding of Duisburg, which would have made it among the earliest cities in Europe.

=== Roman period ===
Latest archaeological studies show that the present-day market-place was already in use in the first century. It has been the major central trading place of the city since the 5th century. The city itself was located at the "[[Hellweg]]", an important medieval [[trade route]], and at a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] across the Rhine. The [[Rome|Romans]] already guarded the ford.
* 420: The [[Franks]] usurp the Roman settlement and recolonize the old part of the town.
* 883: The [[Normans]] conquer Duisburg and stay for the winter. First historic document mentioning Duisburg.

=== Middle Ages ===
Due to the town's favorable geographic position a [[Count palatine|palatinate]] was built and the town was soon granted the [[Royal Charter|royal charter]] of a [[Free imperial city|free city]]. Duisburg became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Around 1000 the river Rhine moved westward from the city. This put an end to the city's development as a trading town and it soon grew into a quiet rural city.
[[File:Duisburg Mercatorbrunnen 1.jpg|thumb|Mercatorbrunnen (''"Mercator fountain"'') in front of the town hall]]
The productions of cartographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] and the foundation of a university in 1655 established the city's renown as "Educated Duisburg" ("Duisburgum Doctum").

* 1279: "city charter" granted by King [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]]
* 1290 Duisburg becomes part of the County (after 1417 Duchy) of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]]
* 1445 attack by Archbishop-Elector [[Dietrich II von Moers]] ([[:de:Dietrich II. von Moers|de]]) of [[Archbishop-Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]] was thwarted[[File:DuisburgVogelschauplan1566.jpg|thumb|Duisburg Corputius plan 1566]]
* 1566 [[Johannes Corputius]] completes his [[city map]] of Duisburg.
* 1666 Duisburg within the Duchy of Cleves becomes a part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]

=== Industrial revolution ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12562, Duisburg, Binnenhafen.jpg|thumb|right|Binnenhafen in 1931]]
The rise of tobacco and textile industries in the 18th century made Duisburg an industrial center. Big industrial companies such as iron and steel producing firms ([[Thyssen AG|Thyssen]] and [[Krupp]]) influenced the development of the city within the Prussian [[Rhine Province]].
Large housing areas near production sites were being built as workers and their families moved in.
* 1823 a district ("Landkreis") Duisburg is established including the cities of [[Essen]] and [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]].
* 1824 construction of the [[sulfuric acid]] factory Fr. W. Curtius; beginning of the industry age in Duisburg.
* 1828 Franz Haniel builds a dockyard for [[Steamboat|steamships]]
* 1846 [[Cologne–Duisburg railway|railway line to Düsseldorf]]
* 1847 [[Cologne-Minden trunk line|railway line via Dortmund to Minden]]
* 1873 Duisburg becomes an [[independent city]] borough.
* 1904 Birth of the 100,000th resident (Ernst R. Straube)
* 1921 French Infantry occupy the city on 8 March to secure [[War reparations|war reparation]] payments incurred during World War I.
* 1929 The city of Hamborn and Duisburg are joined together. The new city is given the name of Duisburg-Hamborn.
* 1935 Duisburg-Hamborn is renamed Duisburg.
* 1938 (November) The [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] destroy the city's synagogue.

=== World War II ===
{{Main|Bombing of Duisburg in World War II}}
A major logistical center in the Ruhr and location of chemical, steel and iron industries, Duisburg was a primary target of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[bomber]]s. As such, it is considered by some historians{{who|date=October 2018}} to be the single most heavily bombed German city by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], with industrial areas and residential blocks targeted by Allied [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]].

On the night of 12–13 June 1941, British bombers dropped a total of 445 tons of bombs in and around Duisburg. As part of the [[Battle of the Ruhr]], another British raid of 577 bombers destroyed the old city between 12 and 13 May 1943 with 1,599 tons of bombs. During the [[Strategic bombing|bombing raids]], 96,000 people were made homeless with countless lives lost.

In 1944 the city was again badly damaged as a total of 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped on 22 May. On 14 October, the tonnage was repeated with 2,018 tons when [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]], [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], and [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] bombers appeared over Duisburg as part of [[Operation Hurricane (1944)|Operation Hurricane]]. This daylight raid was followed by a night attack; over 24 hours about 9,000 tons of HE and incendiaries had been dropped on Duisburg. Numerous similar attacks followed until the end of 1944.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Duisburg in April 1945. The US [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]], acting as regular infantry and not in a parachute role, met only scattered resistance in the vicinity and captured the city on 12 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'' (revised ed., 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 97.</ref>

On 8 May 1945 the [[ADSEC]] Engineer Group A, led by Col. [[Helmer Swenholt]], [[commanding officer]] of the [[332nd Engineer General Service Regiment (United States)|332nd Engineer General Service Regiment]], constructed a [[Duisburg-Hochfeld rail bridge|railway bridge between Duisburg and Rheinhausen]] across the Rhine. It was 860 meters long, and constructed in six days, fifteen hours and twenty minutes, a record time. It was named the "Victory Bridge".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peacock |first1=Jim |first2=Tom |last2=Peacock |url=http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Bunker/7676/duisberg.html |title=Duisberg |publisher=Yahoo |work=Geocities |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024003735/http://geocities.com/Pentagon/Bunker/7676/duisberg.html |archive-date=24 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Post-World War II period ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}[[File:Duisburg-Beeck 05.02.2013 09.JPG|thumb|Shrinking Duisburg: Abandoned buildings in the borough of Beeck|alt=]]
A total of 299 bombing raids had almost completely destroyed the historic cityscape. 80% of all residential buildings had been destroyed or partly damaged. Almost the whole of the city had to be rebuilt, and most historic landmarks had been lost.

Beginning in the mid-1960s, the decline of Duisburg's steel and mining industry caused a significant loss of residents. While in 1975 approximately 590,000 people were living in Duisburg, the number had shrunk to 518,000 in 1985.

Duisburg celebrated its 1100th anniversary in 1983. The city's population recovered a little in the following years, up to 537,000 in 1992. It declined to 488,000 in 2011. On 19 July 2004, it was hit by a [[tornado]]. The municipal theater and parts of the city center were damaged. The city hosted the 7th [[World Games]] in 2005. In 2010, 21 people died because of a mass panic at the [[Love Parade disaster|Love Parade]]; over 500 people were injured.

==Demographics==
In 2010, Duisburg had a population of 489,600, a slight decrease since 2006.

=== Duisburg Port ===
[[Duisburg-Ruhrorter Häfen]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duisport.de/?lang=en/ |title=Führende Logistikdrehscheibe in Zentraleuropa – Duisburger Hafen AG |access-date=11 December 2016}}</ref> is the city's inland port. It is officially regarded as a seaport because seagoing river vessels go to ports in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Numerous docks are mostly located at the mouth of the Ruhr where it joins the Rhine.

Each year more than 40 million tonnes of various goods are handled with more than 20,000 ships calling at the port. The public harbour facilities stretch across an area of {{convert|7.4|km2|1|abbr=out}}. There are 21 docks covering an area of {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} of wharf. The area of the Logport Logistic Center Duisburg stretches across an area of {{convert|2.65|km2|2|abbr=on}}. With 2.5 million [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] it is also the largest inland container port, based on 2011 figures.<ref>[http://europe.nxtbook.com/nxteu/informa/ci_top100ports2012/index.php Top 100 Container Ports 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604022703/http://europe.nxtbook.com/nxteu/informa/ci_top100ports2012/index.php |date=4 June 2013}}</ref> A number of companies run their own private docks and 114 million tonnes of goods yearly (2010) are handled in Duisburg in total.

=== Roads ===
Duisburg is served by several [[autobahn]]s, with 3 east–west routes and 2 north–south routes. [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] forms a bypass east of the city and mostly serves through traffic. [[Bundesautobahn 59|A59]] runs parallel to A3 and serves the city from north to south with 14 interchanges, much more than most other cities in the Ruhr area. The [[Bundesautobahn 40|A40]] and [[Bundesautobahn 42|A42]] are two east–west routes that serve central and northern Duisburg. Autobahn A40 also serves major through traffic from the Netherlands to Berlin and points east. A short spur, [[Bundesautobahn 524|A524]] serves southern Duisburg. Most Autobahns have six lanes or are upgraded to six lanes (A59).

Apart from the autobahns, no [[Bundesstraße]]n serve the city directly. [[Bundesstraße 8|B8]] runs through the city, but uses A59's alignment. B288 runs in the extreme south of the city, and serves traffic to and from [[Krefeld]]. Several bridges span the Rhine, most prominently the A40 and A42 bridges, but also the L287 [[suspension bridge]] and the L237 [[arch bridge]], a three-lane bridge with 2 lanes per peak direction with dynamic lane usage.

=== Public transport ===
[[Duisburg Hauptbahnhof]] is served by the [[Intercity-Express|InterCityExpress]] and [[InterCity]] long-distance network of the [[Deutsche Bahn]], in addition line {{ric|Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn|1}} of the [[Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] line connects Duisburg with other cities of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] area.

The [[Duisburg Stadtbahn]], the [[Trams in Duisburg|Duisburg tramway network]], and a bus system, all operated by the Duisburger Verkehrsgesellschaft, provide local services. Stadtbahn line U79, the so-called "D-Bahn" ("D-Line"), connects to the neighbouring city of [[Düsseldorf]] and is operated jointly with the [[Rheinbahn]] of Düsseldorf. All S-Bahn, Stadtbahn, and bus lines operate under the umbrella of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]].

== Media ==
There are several newspapers reporting on local events and politics, including the ''[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|Westdeutsche Allgemeine]]'' (WAZ), the ''Neue Ruhr Zeitung'' (NRZ) and the ''[[Rheinische Post]]'' (RP). The local [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] "Radio Duisburg" was the first local radio broadcaster in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of North Rhine-Westphalia. It started broadcasting in 1990.
There is a local television station ("STUDIO 47"), which was the first local station to broadcast in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It started broadcasting in 2006. In its Duisburg studios the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] produces a local programme for the city of Duisburg and the [[Lower Rhine]] region north of Düsseldorf. WDR is part of the German television and radio network [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]].

== Culture ==
Duisburg hosts a comprehensive range of cultural facilities and events. A highlight is the annual "Duisburger Akzente",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duisburger-akzente.de/ |title=38. Duisburger Akzente 2017 – Theater, Bildende Kunst & Literatur |first=Duisburg Marketing |last=GmbH |access-date=11 December 2016}}</ref> a festival focusing on modern social, political and cultural topics.

Besides [[Düsseldorf]] Duisburg is a residence of the [[Deutsche Oper am Rhein]], one of the major [[opera house]]s in Germany. The [[Duisburg Philharmonic|Duisburg Philharmonic Orchestra]] is one of Germany's orchestras with an international reputation.

Due to its history as a harbour city and a trade and industrial center, Duisburg offers a variety of architectural places of interest, such as the [[German Inland Waterways Museum]]. Buildings vary from old churches such as St. Johann Baptist in Duisburg-Hamborn, which was built in 900, to [[Modern era|modern age]] buildings such as Micro-Electronic-Centrum in Duisburg-Neudorf, built in 1995. Another subject of interest is the [[Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.landschaftspark.de/en/home/index.php |title=Duisburg-Nord Landscape Park |work=Landschaftspark.de |date=23 April 2009 |access-date=5 May 2009}}</ref> an abandoned industrial complex open to the public and an Anchor Point of ERIH, The [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]].

The city also contains two [[botanical garden]]s, the [[Botanischer Garten Duisburg-Hamborn]] and the [[Botanischer Garten Kaiserberg]], as well as a number of municipal parks.

On 24 July 2010, 21 people were killed and hundreds injured in the city during the [[Love Parade disaster]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-germany-love-parade-20100725,0,2079922.story|title=Love Parade stampede in Germany kills at least 18 - latimes.com|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=25 July 2010|first=Kate|last=Connolly|date=25 July 2010}}</ref> The [[Love Parade]] was an electronic dance music festival and [[technoparade]].
