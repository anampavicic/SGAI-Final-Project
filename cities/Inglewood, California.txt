'''Inglewood''' is a city in southwestern [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States, in the [[Greater Los Angeles|Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. As of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 U.S. Census]], the city had a population of 107,762. It is in the [[South Bay (Los Angeles County)|South Bay]] region of Los Angeles County, near [[Los Angeles International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chooselacounty.com/images/doingbusiness/la-county-map.jpg |title=Home |publisher=Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation|access-date=August 25, 2017}}</ref>

The Inglewood area was developed following the opening of the [[Venice–Inglewood Line|Venice–Inglewood railway]] in 1887 and incorporated as a city on February 14, 1908.<ref name="inc">{{cite news |title=City History |work=City of Inglewood |url=http://www.cityofinglewood.org/about/city_history.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309112430/http://www.cityofinglewood.org/about/city_history.asp |archive-date=March 9, 2008  }}</ref> The city is a major hub for professional sports with several teams that have played in Inglewood's venues. [[Kia Forum|The Kia Forum]], an indoor arena, opened in 1967 and hosted the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], [[Los Angeles Kings]] of the [[National Hockey League]], and [[Los Angeles Sparks]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] until the opening of [[Staples Center]] in 1999. Two [[National Football League]] teams—the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] and [[Los Angeles Rams]]—have played at [[SoFi Stadium]] since it opened in 2020; the stadium will also host the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2028 Summer Olympics]]. The [[Los Angeles Clippers]] of the National Basketball Association began play at [[Intuit Dome]] in 2024.

==History==
[[File:Centinela Springs 3 (cropped).JPG|left|thumb|upright|The [[Aguaje de Centinela]] was a spring used by [[Indigenous Californians|Native Californians]], [[Californios]], and early Americans.]]
The earliest residents of what is now Inglewood were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who used the [[Aguaje de Centinela]] [[natural spring]]s in today's [[Centinela Park|Edward Vincent Sr. Park]] (known for most of its history as Centinela Park). Local historian [[Gladys Waddingham]] wrote that these springs took the name Centinela from the hills that rose gradually around them, and which allowed ranchers to watch over their herds," (thus the name ''centinelas ''or sentinels).{{r|GW}}

===Spanish era===
[[File:Antonio Ygnacio Ávila (Rancho Sausal Redondo) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Much of Inglewood was originally part of [[Rancho Sausal Redondo]], granted in 1837 to Antonio Ygnacio Ávila, of the prominent [[Ávila family of California]].]]
Among the original settlers of Los Angeles in 1781 was the Spanish soldier [[Rancho La Ballona#Machado family|Jose Manuel Orchado Machado]], "a 23-year-old [[Mule train (transport)|muleteer]] from Los Alamos in [[Sinaloa]]". These settlers were ordered by the officials of the San Gabriel Mission "to graze their animals on the ocean side of Los Angeles in order not to infringe on mission lands." As a result, the settlers, or ''pobladores'', drove some of their cattle to the "lush pasture lands near Centinela Springs", and the first construction there was done by [[Ávila family of California|Bruno Ygnacio Ávila]], who received a permit in 1822 to build a "corral and hut for his herders."<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|unpaged [xiv]|date=May 2009}} The area that is now Inglewood was divided into two [[ranchos of California|''rancho'' grants]]: [[Rancho Sausal Redondo]] and [[Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=December 8, 2022 |title=Inglewood: 8 Things You Didn't Know About The Neighborhood's History |url=https://www.lataco.com/inglewood-history-la/ |access-date=December 13, 2022 |work=L.A.

Later, Avila constructed a three-room adobe house on a slight rise overlooking the creek that ran from Centinela Springs all the way to the ocean.

====Labor unions====

Labor troubles became a serious issue during the early years of [[World War II]] as local industries supplied the Allies, against the wishes of Communist local union officials. In 1941, the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) won the election over the [[International Association of Machinists]] and represented all the employees at the [[North American Aviation]] factory in Inglewood. UAW negotiators demanded a starting pay of 75 cents an hour, plus a 10-cent raise for the 11,000 current employees. The UAW had made a no-strike pledge, but suddenly a wildcat strike on June 4 closed the plant that produced a fourth of the nation's fighter planes. The UAW was unable to get the workers to return, when Washington intervened. With the approval of national CIO leadership, President Franklin Roosevelt sent in the California national guard to reopen the plant. When Germany suddenly invaded the USSR in late June 1941, though, the Communist activists suddenly became the strongest supporters of war production; they crushed wildcat strikes.<ref>Max M. Kampelman, ''The Communist Party vs. the CIO: A Study in Power Politics'' (1957) pp. 25-27.</ref><ref>Robert H. Zieger, ''The CIO: 1935-1955'' (1995) pp 128-130.</ref><ref>John Barnard, ''American Vanguard: The United Auto Workers During the Reuther Years, 1935–1970'' (2004) pp 173-176.</ref>

====African-American influence====
"No blacks had ever lived in Inglewood", [[Gladys Waddingham]] wrote,<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|59|date=May 2009}}  but by 1960, "they lived in great numbers along its eastern borders. This came to the great displeasure of the predominantly white residents already residing in Inglewood. In 1960, the census counted only 29 "Negroes" among Inglewood's 63,390 residents. Not a single black child attended the city's schools. Real-estate agents refused to show homes to blacks. A rumored curfew kept blacks off the streets at night. Inglewood was a prime target because of its previous history of restrictions." "Fair housing and school busing were the main problems of 1964. The schools were not prepared to handle racial incidents, even though any that occurred were very minor. Adults held many heated community meetings, since the blacks objected to busing as much as did the whites."<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|61|date=May 2009}} In 1969, an organization called "Morningside Neighbors" changed its name to "Inglewood Neighbors" "in the hope of promoting more integration."<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|63|date=May 2009}}

On July 22, 1970, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Max F. Deutz ordered Inglewood schools to desegregate in response to a suit filed by 19 parents.<ref name=LAT19700902>{{cite news|title=Parents Lose Plea in Inglewood Suit|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 2, 1970| page=D-2}}</ref> At least since 1965, said Deutz, the Inglewood school board had been aware of a growing influx of black families into its eastern areas, but had done nothing about the polarization of its pupils into an eastern black area and a western white one.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inglewood Order|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 26, 1970|page=F-5}}</ref> On August 31, he rejected an appeal by four parents who said the school board was not responsible for the segregation, but that the blacks "selected their places of residence by voluntary choice."<ref name=LAT19700902/>

The first black principal among the 18 Inglewood schools was Peter Butler at La Tijera Elementary,<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|66|date=May 2009}} and in 1971, the "Stormy racial meetings in 1971" included a charge by "some real estate men in the overflowing Crozier Auditorium" that the Human Relations Commission was acting like "the Gestapo".<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|67|date=May 2009}} In that year, Loyd Sterling Webb, president of Inglewood Neighbors, became the first black officeholder when voters elected him to the school board.<ref>{{cite news|id={{ProQuest|156655639}}|title=Negro Elected to Inglewood Public Office|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 7, 1971|page=18}}</ref>

In 1972, Curtis Tucker Sr., was appointed as the first black city council member.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|69|date=May 2009}} That year, composer LeRoy Hurte, an [[African-American]], took the baton of the Inglewood Symphony Orchestra and continued to work with it for 20 years.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|75|date=May 2009}} [[Edward Vincent Jr.]] became Inglewood's first black mayor in 1983.

====Rise of Latino population====
The 1990 census showed that Latinos in Inglewood had increased by 134% since 1980, the largest jump in the South Bay. Economic factors apparently played a role in where new arrivals settled, said David Heer, a USC professor of sociology and associate director of the university's Population Research Laboratory. "Housing is generally less expensive here than elsewhere . . . and I would say that they receive a warmer welcome here", said Norm Cravens, assistant city manager in Inglewood, where the white population dropped from nearly 21% in 1980 to 8.5% in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|id={{ProQuest|281324756}}|author=Janet-Rae Dupree|title=Census Shows Influx of Asians on Peninsula|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 28, 1991|page=3}}</ref>

In the 2000 census, blacks made up 47% of the city's residents (53,060 people), and Latinos comprised 46% (51,829), but the Census Bureau estimated that in 2007, the percentage of blacks had declined to 41% (48,252) and that Latinos were at 52.5% (61,847). The white population declined from 19 (21,505) to 17.7% (20,853).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=Search&geo_id=01000US&_geoContext=01000US&_street=&_county=Inglewood&_cityTown=Inglewood&_state=04000US06&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|title=American FactFinder – Community Facts|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212052428/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=Search&geo_id=01000US&_geoContext=01000US&_street=&_county=Inglewood&_cityTown=Inglewood&_state=04000US06&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|archive-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&geo_id=16000US0636546&_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US06%7C16000US0636546&_street=&_county=Inglewood&_cityTown=Inglewood&_state=04000US06&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=160&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|title=American FactFinder – Community Facts|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200210212624/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&geo_id=16000US0636546&_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US06%7C16000US0636546&_street=&_county=Inglewood&_cityTown=Inglewood&_state=04000US06&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=160&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|archive-date=February 10, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

That year, though, only one of the city's five city council members was Latino: Jose Fernandez.

===Religious history===
In 2007, the area served by the Inglewood post office (including Lennox) had 98 churches, temples, mosques, chapels and other houses of worship, according to the AreaConnect.com website.<ref>{{cite news |title=Inglewood Churches and Religion (Inglewood, California) |work=areaConnect |publisher=MDNH, Inc.|url=http://inglewood.areaconnect.com/churches.htm}}</ref>

The first church service was held on April 22, 1888, in the Inglewood House hotel on Commercial Street (today's La Brea Avenue), popularly called Mrs. Belden's Boarding House, when Inglewood had only 300 residents and 112 registered voters. Later, services were in Bucephalus Hall, but eventually the congregation moved to Hyde Park, which left Inglewood with no church. On January 19, 1890, Inglewood's first permanent church – Presbyterian – was established on Market Street. A bit later, the [United] Brethren constructed a building on South Market Street.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|6, 10, and 17|date=May 2009}}

In 1907, a group of Episcopalians began services in a private home, and a few years later, the first Catholic services were held in Bank Hall. In 1910, the Presbyterians moved their two buildings, a sanctuary and a manse, to the corner of Grevillea and Nutwood "because the streetcars [on Market Street] were so noisy and threw so much dust and sand fleas in the windows."<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|14 and 17|date=May 2009}}

===Trash-hauling pact===
In 2018, an investigation began into a 2012 trash-hauling contract valued at $100 million; it went to a bidder with connections to current mayor James T. Butts.

When the Inglewood Union High School District, now known as the [[Centinela Valley Union High School District]], opened in 1905, the Inglewood School District, then only operating primary schools, was within the high school district. The Centinela Valley district received its current name on November 1, 1944. On July 1, 1954, the Inglewood elementary school district withdrew from the Centinela Valley district, becoming a unified school district.<ref name=CVUHSDHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.centinela.k12.ca.us/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=126439&type=d&pREC_ID=251197|title=History and Profile|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064209/http://www.centinela.k12.ca.us/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=126439&type=d&pREC_ID=251197|archive-date=April 21, 2014|website=[[Centinela Valley Union High School District]]}}</ref>

===Schools history===
In 1888, a school district was organized, trustees were elected and a building was chosen. The school opened on May 21 that year on the second floor of a [[livery stable]] on Grevillea Avenue between Regent Street and Orchard (today's Florence Avenue), with 17 boys and 16 girls. The first teacher was Minnie Walker, a graduate of Los Angeles State Normal School. The schoolroom, named Bucephalus Hall, after a horse belonging to town founder [[Daniel Freeman (Los Angeles County)|Daniel Freeman]], was also used for community meetings.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|6|date=May 2009}}

Meanwhile, a permanent school building was erected on Grevillea Avenue a block to the south, between Regent and Queen. It remained Inglewood's only school until 1911. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1920.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|6 and 26|date=May 2009}}

The [[Centinela Valley Union High School District]] was organized in 1904 to bring secondary education to the town. Inglewood High opened in two rooms of the school building with 15 students taught by Nina Martin, principal, and Anna McClelland. Four years later, a new building rose on {{convert|9.5|acre|ha}} of land, and the first graduation of one boy and four girls took place in 1908.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|13–14|date=May 2009}}
Until 1912 there was a new principal every year at the [[grammar school]], but on May 8 of that year George W. Crozier was named principal, and he held the post for 20 years. The school was renamed in his honor in 1932.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|20|date=May 2009}} In 1913, George M. Green was appointed principal of Inglewood Union High School; he retired from that position in 1939.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|22|date=May 2009}}

In 1914, voters approved bonds for high school improvement. Four more buildings and a [[Power station|power plant]] were erected, "joined by walks and arcades." The improvement included a "five-room model flat in the Home Economics Building." Nine acres of land were bought at Kelso Avenue and Damask (now Inglewood Avenue) for an experimental agricultural statement, thenceforth known as "The Farm." There were gardens, an orchard and an alfalfa field. In 1915 Inglewood High won a first-place Los Angeles County prize for its beautiful ivy-covered brick buildings.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|24|date=May 2009}} These buildings were destroyed in 1953 to make room for new ones.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|unpaged [58c]|date=May 2009}}

In the mid-1920s, the high school district stretched all the way south to El Segundo, so two women teachers were asked to live in El Segundo and ride the school buses with the students every day to and from that city – for an extra dollar a day in pay. In 1923 girls adopted a school uniform, "a dark blue skirt with a white middy."<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|30|date=May 2009}}

In 1925 a new fine arts building for the high school was erected on the southwest corner of Grevillea and Manchester, replacing the Truax Candy Kitchen,<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|34|date=May 2009}} but it was severely damaged by the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|Long Beach earthquake]] of 1933. It was "later rebuilt with WPA help but lost its magnificent stairway and all its fireplaces." Temporary classrooms were built on Olive Street, "all too cold in winter and too hot most of the time."<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|41|date=May 2009}}

The athletic field on the west side of the campus, later called Badenoch Field, was used for physical education and sporting events. In 1937, agricultural classes were ended at the Farm and Sentinel Field was dedicated there for sports activities.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|30|date=May 2009}} By 1938 there were more than 3,000 students and 141 teachers at the high school.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|43|date=May 2009}}

The "startling news" of 1948 was the dismissal "of the entire administrative staff at Inglewood High School, beginning with Principal James R. Haines." He was replaced by Forrest Murdoch of Everett, Washington, as superintendent and Fred Heisner as principal.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|49|date=May 2009}}

In 1952, another secondary school campus in Inglewood was opened in the east side neighborhood of Lockhaven as [[Morningside High School]].<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|55|date=May 2009}} Center Park School of Los Angeles became part of the Inglewood School District in 1961 when its area (Crenshaw-Imperial) was annexed to the city.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|59|date=May 2009}} In the 1970s, its name was changed to Worthington School to honor Frances and William Worthington.<ref name="GW"/>{{Rp|74|date=May 2009}}
