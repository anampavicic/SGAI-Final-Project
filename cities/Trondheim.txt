As of 2022, it had a population of 212,660.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 February 2020 |title=Population, SSB |url=https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/folkemengde |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200501221327/https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/folkemengde |archive-date=1 May 2020 |access-date=1 March 2020 |website=SSB}}</ref> Trondheim is the third most populous municipality in Norway, and is the [[List of continuously built-up areas in Norway by population|fourth largest]] [[urban area]]. Trondheim lies on the south shore of [[Trondheim Fjord]] at the mouth of the River [[Nidelva]]. Among the significant technology-oriented institutions headquartered in Trondheim are the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU), the [[SINTEF|Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF)]], the [[Geological Survey of Norway]] (NGU), and [[St. Olavs University Hospital]].

The settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post and served as the capital of Norway from the [[Viking Age]] until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]]; it then became, and has remained, the seat of the Lutheran [[Diocese of Nidaros]] and the site of the [[Nidaros Cathedral]]. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality was formed in 1964, when Trondheim merged with [[Byneset]], [[Leinstrand]], [[Strinda]], and [[Tiller, Norway|Tiller]], and further expanded on 1 January 2020, when Trondheim merged with [[Klæbu]].

Trondheim has a mild climate for its northerly latitude, resulting in moderate summers and winters that often remain above the freezing point in seaside areas. At higher elevations, though, the [[microclimate]] is colder and snowier.

The city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of [[Trøndelag]] county but not as its administrative centre (which is [[Steinkjer]]). This is designed to avoid making the county administration too [[centralized]].

Trondheim is home to [[Association football|football]] club [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]], Norway's most successful football club, and [[Granåsen Ski Centre]], which has hosted the World Championship in [[Nordic Skiing]].

{{See also|Names of Trondheim in different languages}}
The city was established in 997 by [[Olav Tryggvason]] and it was originally named {{lang|no|Nidaros}} ({{langx|non|Niðaróss}}). The first element of the name was the local river [[Nidelva|Nid]]. The last element of the name was {{wikt-lang|non|óss}} which meant "the mouth of a river". Thus the name meant "the outlet of the river [[Nidelva|Nid]]". Although the formal name was Nidaros, the city was commonly known as {{wikt-lang|non|kaupangr}}, which means "city" or "marketplace", or more specifically {{lang|non|kaupangr í Þróndheimi}} which means "the city in Trondheim". Trondheim ({{langx|non|Þróndheimr}}) was the historic name for the whole district which is now known as [[Trøndelag]]. This is the area where the people were known as Trønder ({{wikt-lang|non|þróndr}}). This district name Trondheim meant "the home of the Trønder people" (literally "Trønder-home") and Trøndelag ({{langx|non|Þrǿndalǫg}}) originally meant the "law area of the Trønder people" (literally "Trønder-law"). The name of the Trønder people derives from the [[Old Norse]] word {{wikt-lang|non|þróndr}} which is an old present participle of the verb {{wikt-lang|non|þróask}} which means "to grow" or "to thrive".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Þróask |url=https://cleasby-vigfusson-dictionary.vercel.app/word/throask |access-date=2024-01-07 |website=Cleasby & Vigfusson Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Peterson |first=Lena |title=Nordiskt runnamnslexikon. Femte, reviderade utgåvan |year=2007 |page=237 |language=no}}</ref>

During the late [[Middle Ages]], the city name was commonly shortened to ''{{lang|non|Þróndheimr}}'', dropping the ''kaupanger'' part, and over time the name became {{lang|da|Trondhjem}}, using the [[Dano-Norwegian]] spelling rather than the [[Old Norse]] spelling since the city was part of the Kingdom of [[Denmark-Norway]] for centuries.

On 21 December 1917, a [[royal decree|royal resolution]] enacted the [[Norwegian language conflict|1917 Norwegian language reforms]]. Around the time, many municipalities and cities had their names changed to "Norwegianize" the spelling and make them look less [[Danish language|Danish]]. On 1 January 1919, the name of the local [[Church of Norway]] diocese was changed from ''{{lang|no|Trondhjem stift}}'' to ''{{lang|no|Nidaros bispedømme}}'' ({{langx|en|[[Diocese of Nidaros]]}}).<ref>{{Cite journal |year=1918 |title=Norsk Lovtidende. 2den Afdeling. 1918.

In 1928, a [[referendum]] in Trondhjem was held on whether to keep the current name or to bring back the original name of ''Nidaros''. The vote resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of {{lang|da|Trondhjem}} and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bratberg |first=Terje T.

Trondheim was briefly named ''{{lang|de|Drontheim}}'' during the [[Second World War]] as a [[German exonyms|German exonym]].

== History ==
[[File:TrondheimBridge-modf.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Town Bridge]] of Trondheim]]
{{For|the ecclesiastical history|Archiepiscopate of Nidaros}}

Trondheim was named Kaupangen ({{langx|en|market place or trading place}}) by [[Viking]] [[King of Norway|King]] [[Olav Tryggvason]] in 997 CE.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sjåvik |first=Jan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yIjfXhQY_QC&pg=PA203 |title=The A to Z of Norway (The A to Z Guide Series Book 234) |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9780810872134 |page=203 |access-date=2019-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528153921/https://books.google.com/books?id=_yIjfXhQY_QC&pg=PA203 |archive-date=28 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> Shortly after that, it came to be called ''[[Nidaros]]''. Initially, it was frequently used as a military retainer ([[Old Norse]]: "hird"-man) of King Olav I. It was also frequently used as the king's seat and was Norway's capital until 1217.

People have lived in the region for thousands of years, as evidenced by the [[Rock carvings in Central Norway|rock carvings in central Norway]], the [[Nøstvet and Lihult cultures]], and the [[Corded Ware culture]]. In ancient times, the [[List of Norwegian monarchs|kings of Norway]] were hailed in Trondheim at [[Øretinget]], the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River [[Nidelva]]. [[Harald Fairhair]] (865–933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon I]], called 'the Good.' The battle of ''[[Kalvskinnet]]'' took place in Trondheim in 1179: King [[Sverre Sigurdsson]] and his ''[[Birkebeiner]]'' warriors were victorious against [[Erling Skakke]] (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous [[Lewis chessmen]], 12th-century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory that were found in the [[Hebrides]] and are now at the [[British Museum]], may have been made in Trondheim.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Moore |first=Susan |date=2019-06-20 |title=The enduring enigma of the 'lost' Lewis chessmen |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2266d662-8ebf-11e9-b8cb-26a9caa9d67b |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920062609/https://www.ft.com/content/2266d662-8ebf-11e9-b8cb-26a9caa9d67b |archive-date=20 September 2019 |access-date=2019-07-16 |work=Financial Times}}</ref>

From 1152, Trondheim was the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros|Archbishop of Nidaros]] for Norway, which operated from the [[Archbishop's Palace, Trondheim|Archbishop's Palace]]. Due to the introduction of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestantism in 1537, the last archbishop, [[Olav Engelbrektsson]], had to flee from the city to the [[Seventeen Provinces|Netherlands]]; he died in what today is [[Lier, Belgium]].

From the 16th through the 19th centuries, the city was repeatedly ravaged by fires that caused widespread damage since many of its buildings were made of wood. The worst occurred in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, 1717 (twice), 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. After the "[[1681 Trondheim fire|Horneman Fire]]" in 1681, there was an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General [[Johan Caspar von Cicignon]], originally from [[Luxembourg]]. Broad avenues, such as Munkegata, were created, without regard for private property rights, to limit the damage from future fires. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nikel |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyZoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT376 |title=Moon Norway (Travel Guide) |publisher=Moon Publications |year=2017 |isbn=978-1631214813 |page=376 |access-date=2019-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528153913/https://books.google.com/books?id=YyZoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT376 |archive-date=28 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

After the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of [[Trøndelag]] became Swedish territory briefly. [[Siege of Trondheim|However, after a three-month long siege]], the area was reconquered 10 months later.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Larsen |first=Karen |url=https://www.google.se/books/edition/A_History_of_Norway/vhfWCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=J%C3%B8rgen+Bjelke+trondheim&pg=PA288&printsec=frontcover |title=A History of Norway |date=2015-12-08 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4008-7579-5 |page=288 |language=en}}</ref> The conflict was finally settled by the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] on 27 May 1660.

[[File:Plan of Trondheim, 1942.jpg|thumb|Plan of Trondheim, 1942]]
During the [[Second World War]], Trondheim was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from 9 April 1940, the first day of the [[Operation Weserübung|invasion of Norway]], until the end of the war in Europe, [[VE Day|8 May 1945]]. The German invasion force consisted of the [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper]], 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Except for a coastal battery that opened fire, there was no resistance to the invasion, which began on 9 April at 5 AM. On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim, as part of the [[Namsos Campaign]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brown |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZf7AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA75 |title=Naval Operations of the Campaign in Norway, April–June 1940 (Naval Staff Histories) |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |isbn=0714651192 |page=75 |access-date=2019-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528153922/https://books.google.com/books?id=XZf7AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA75 |archive-date=28 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, [[Henry Rinnan]], who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian resistance groups. The city and its citizens were subjected to harsh treatment by the occupying power, including the imposition of [[Martial law in Trondheim in 1942|martial law]] in October 1942. During this time, the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker [[Dora I|DORA I]]), and contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, ''[[Nordstern (city)|Nordstern]]'' ("Northern Star"), centred {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of [[Øysand]] on the outskirts of [[Melhus]] municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the future primary stronghold of the German [[Kriegsmarine]]. A start was made on this enormous construction project, but it was far from completed when the war ended, and today, there are few physical remains of it.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hitlers drøm om Trondheim |url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article712500.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013173048/http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article712500.ece |archive-date=13 October 2007 |access-date=13 March 2023}}</ref>

===Municipal history===
The city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). On 1 January 1864, part of [[Strinda]] (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the [[Lade, Trondheim|Lade]] area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of [[Leinstrand]] (population: 4,193), [[Byneset]] (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and [[Tiller, Norway|Tiller]] (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jukvam |first=Dag |year=1999 |title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen |url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003043344/http://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2013 |access-date=20 April 2011 |publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyrå]] |language=no}}</ref> On 1 January 2020, the neighboring [[Klæbu Municipality]] (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trondheim Kommune |date=17 June 2016 |title=Ja til sammenslåing av Klæbu og Trondheim |url=https://www.trondheim.kommune.no/content/1117754484/Ja-til-sammenslaing-av-Klabu-og-Trondheim |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008232209/https://www.trondheim.kommune.no/content/1117754484/Ja-til-sammenslaing-av-Klabu-og-Trondheim |archive-date=8 October 2017 |access-date=8 January 2018 |language=no}}</ref>

===Coat of arms and seal===
{{See also|Flag of Trondheim}}
The [[coat of arms]] dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an [[archbishop]] with his staff and [[mitre]] in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by Håkon Thorsen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trondheim's coat of arms and seal |url=http://www.trondheim.no/content.ap?thisId=519505 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208055210/http://www.trondheim.no/content.ap?thisId=519505 |archive-date=8 December 2008 |access-date=29 October 2008 |publisher=Trondheim kommune}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Nidelva-Trondheim-foliage.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn [[foliage]] along Nidelva; October 2009]]
Trondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets [[Trondheim Fjord]] with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. In the Middle Ages the river was deep enough to be navigable by most boats. However, in the mid-17th century, an avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable, and partly ruined the harbour. The municipality's highest elevation is the [[Storheia]] hill, {{convert|565|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. At the summer [[solstice]], the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon. Between 23 May and 19 July, when the sky is cloud-free, it remains light enough at night that no artificial lighting is needed outdoors.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trondheim, Norway – Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year – Gaisma |url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/trondheim.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226205408/https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/trondheim.html |archive-date=26 February 2021 |access-date=1 July 2013 |publisher=Gaisma.com}}</ref> At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Trondheim -- Indre Kongsgård sett mot Nidarosdomen i januar.jpg|thumb|left|Mid-winter view near Archbishop's palace and Nidaros Cathedral]]
Trondheim city has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]) or [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb), depending on the winter threshold used (−3&nbsp;°C or 0&nbsp;°C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has slightly colder winters, while the part close to the fjord has the mildest winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard but is more exposed to northwesterly winds. As with the rest of Norway, the weather is dependent on the weather pattern. High pressure over Central Norway or to the east gives sunny weather which can last for weeks. Conversely, Atlantic Lows can also dominate for weeks, and both patterns can happen all year. In 2020 May saw northwesterlies with cold air from northwest lasting weeks and even bringing snowfall, while June 2020 recorded 345 sun hours and new record high {{convert|34.3|°C|0|abbr=on}}, Norway's warmest high in 2020. The sunniest month on record is May 2024 with 366 sunhours. 
Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March,<ref>{{Cite web |title=See Norway's snow, weather, water and climate anytime anywhere |url=http://senorge.no/mapPage.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109024138/http://www.senorge.no/mapPage.aspx |archive-date=9 January 2008 |access-date=29 December 2007}}</ref> but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. There are on average 14 days each winter with at least {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}} or less (1971–2000, airport). There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at a higher elevation, with good skiing conditions in [[Bymarka]]. All the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low −2.7&nbsp;°C. The May record low is from 1900, 3.7&nbsp;°C colder than the second coldest May night. The all-time low {{convert|-26|°C|1|abbr=on}} was recorded February 1899. The all-time high {{convert|35|°C}} was recorded 22 July 1901. The warmest month on record is July 2014 with mean {{convert|19.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} and average daily high {{convert|24.9|°C|1|abbr=on}} (airport). The coldest month on record is February 1966 with mean {{convert|-9.9|°C|1|abbr=on}} and average daily low {{convert|-14.2|°C|1|abbr=on}} (airport). The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below {{convert|0|°C|1|abbr=on}}) in spring is 1 May <ref>{{Cite web |date=4 May 2012 |title=Siste frostnatt om våren |url=https://www.yr.no/artikkel/siste-frostnatt-om-varen-1.8119060 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230306095039/https://www.yr.no/artikkel/siste-frostnatt-om-varen-1.8119060 |archive-date=6 March 2023 |access-date=13 March 2023 |website=NRK}}</ref> and average date for first freeze in autumn is 9 October<ref>{{Cite web |last=Husebø |first=Trond-Ole |date=25 September 2013 |title=Første frostnatt |url=https://www.yr.no/artikkel/forste-frostnatt-1.11261900 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210807222743/https://www.yr.no/artikkel/forste-frostnatt-1.11261900 |archive-date=7 August 2021 |access-date=13 March 2023 |website=NRK}}</ref> giving a frost-free season of 160 days (Trondheim Airport Værnes 1981-2010 average). 
The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre, from 1945 onwards the weather station has been located at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m), therefore being slightly colder.
A new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at [[Gløshaugen]] (NTNU) December 2015, recording more sunhrs than earlier sunrecorder, which had terrain blocking issues.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 June 2017 |title=Over 1600 soltimer i Bergen |url=http://www.arstadposten.no/2017/02/10/1600-soltimer-bergen-fjor-trass-elendig-vaer-skoleferien/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209165248/http://www.arstadposten.no/2017/02/10/1600-soltimer-bergen-fjor-trass-elendig-vaer-skoleferien/ |archive-date=9 December 2018 |access-date=25 June 2017 |publisher=årstadposten |language=no}}</ref> There are on average 229 sunhours in July (based 2016–2020).<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 June 2021 |orig-date=13 June 2021 |title=Slik er været i fellesferien – statistisk sett |url=https://www.met.no/nyhetsarkiv/slik-er-vaeret-i-fellesferien-statistisk-sett |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220223160815/https://www.met.no/nyhetsarkiv/slik-er-vaeret-i-fellesferien-statistisk-sett |archive-date=23 February 2022 |access-date=2022-02-27 |publisher=Met.no}}</ref> Trondheim recorded 197 sunhours in October 2016 beating the previous national record for October.

Most of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets ''Nordre gate'' ({{langx|en|Northern street}}), ''Olav Tryggvasons gate'' and ''Thomas Angells gate'' even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, the area surrounding the old [[drydock]] and ship construction buildings of the defunct [[Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted]] shipbuilding company at the [[Nedre Elvehavn]] was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.

A [[Olav Tryggvason (statue)|statue of Olav Tryggvason]], the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a [[sun dial]], but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.

The islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a [[monastery]], a [[fortress]], [[prison]], and a Second World War [[anti-aircraft]] gun station.

[[Stiftsgården]] is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by [[Cecilie Christine Schøller]]. At 140 rooms constituting {{convert|4000|m2|0}}, it is possibly the largest wooden building in [[Northern Europe]] and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.

A statue of [[Leif Ericson]] is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle [[marina]].

=== Nidaros Cathedral ===
The [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pilgrim ways in Norway, background |url=http://www.trondheim.com/content.ap?thisId=5510350 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823122445/http://www.trondheim.com/content.ap?thisId=5510350 |archive-date=23 August 2007 |access-date=4 August 2007 |publisher=Trondheim kommune}}</ref> with pilgrimage routes leading to it from [[Oslo]] in southern Norway and from the [[Jämtland]] and [[Värmland]] regions of Sweden.

During the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the [[coronation]] church of the Norwegian kings. [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]] in 1957, coronation was replaced by [[consecration]]. In 1991, the present [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Queen Sonja]] were consecrated in the cathedral.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The consecration of King Harald and Queen Sonja |url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c27283/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28740 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192757/http://www.kongehuset.no/c27283/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28740 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=3 August 2007 |publisher=The Norwegian Royal Family}}</ref> On 24 May 2002, their daughter [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Princess Märtha Louise]] married the writer [[Ari Behn]] in the cathedral.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The wedding of Princess Märtha Louise |url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c28617/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28747 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043348/http://www.kongehuset.no/c28617/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28747 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |access-date=3 August 2007 |publisher=The Norwegian Royal Family}}</ref>

The [[Pilgrim's Route]] (''Pilegrimsleden'') to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at [[Nidaros]] Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (''Sankt Olavs vei''), the main route, which is approximately {{convert|640|km}} long, starts in [[Oslo]] and heads North, along Lake [[Mjøsa]], up the valley [[Gudbrandsdalen]], over the mountain range [[Dovrefjell]] and down the [[Oppdal]] valley to end at [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the [[aegis]] of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful [[pilgrims]] upon the completion of their journey.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pilegrimsleden (Miljøstatus i Norge) |url=http://www.miljostatus.no/Tema/Kulturminner/Kulturmiljoer/Pilegrimsleden/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317032509/http://www.miljostatus.no/Tema/Kulturminner/Kulturmiljoer/Pilegrimsleden/ |archive-date=17 March 2009 |language=no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Raju |first=Alison |title=The Pilgrim Road to Nidaros: St Olav's Way – Oslo to Trondheim |publisher=Cicerone Press Limited |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85284-314-4}}</ref>

=== Museums ===
[[Sverresborg]], also named [[Zion]] after [[King David|King David's]] castle in [[Jerusalem]], was a fortification built by [[Sverre Sigurdsson]]. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182–1183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the [[Sverresaga]] indicates it had been restored by 1197.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Denham |first1=Sean Dexter |last2=Westling |first2=Sara |year=2015 |title=Osteologiske og paleobotaniske undersøkelser av skjelett og jordprøve fra Sverresborg, Trøndelag Folkemuseum, Trondheim, Sør-Trøndelag |trans-title=Osteological & paleobotanical examinations of skeleton & soil sample from Sverresborg, Trøndelag Folkemuseum, Trondheim, Sør-Trøndelag |url=https://uis.brage.unit.no/uis-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2426308/2014_19_Sverresborg_Trondheim.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |url-status=live |journal=Oppdragsrapport |language=no |publisher=[[University of Stavanger|Universitetet i Stavanger]] |volume=8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809192736/https://uis.brage.unit.no/uis-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2426308/2014_19_Sverresborg_Trondheim.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |archive-date=9 August 2020 |access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The Trondheim Science Center ({{langx|no|Vitensenteret i Trondheim}}) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The [[NTNU University Museum]] (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]. There are also a variety of small history, science and [[natural history]] museums, such as the [[Trondheim Maritime Museum]], the ''Armoury'', adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum [[Ringve National Museum]], [[Ringve Botanical Garden]], the [[Trondheim Tramway Museum]], and the [[Jewish Museum of Trondheim|Jewish Museum]], co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.

[[Rockheim]] ({{langx|no|Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock}}, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. "The box" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape – especially on dark winter evenings.

=== Prison ===
Vollan District Jail ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Vollan kretsfengsel'') was a [[jail]] during the [[nazi occupation of Norway]] and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a [[concentration camp]].<ref name=NOU1998/> In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. One of its roles was as a [[Internment|transit camp]] for [[political prisoners]]. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to [[Kristiansten Fortress]] and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by [[Henry Rinnan]] and his gang.<ref name="NOU1998">[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/hod/dok/nouer/1998/nou-1998-12/26/7.html?id=375569 "11.7 Fangenskap i Norge"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203093420/http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/hod/dok/nouer/1998/nou-1998-12/26/7.html?id=375569 |date=3 February 2014 }}, ''NOU 1998: 12 Alta bataljon'', regjeringen.no.</ref> It was closed in 1971 after the opening of Trondheim Prison at Tunga.

===Student culture===
[[File:Samfundet trondheim.jpg|thumb|right|The building of the [[Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem]]]]
With students comprising almost a fifth of the population, the city of Trondheim is heavily influenced by student culture. Most noticeable is [[Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem]], the city's student society. Its characteristic round, red building from 1929 sits at the head of the bridge crossing the river southwards from the city centre. As the largest university in Norway, the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU) is the host of some 36,000 students.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 January 2015 |title=NTNU blir størst |url=http://khrono.no/samfunn-struktur/2015/01/ntnu-fusjonerer-med-tre-hogskoler |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403001513/http://khrono.no/samfunn-struktur/2015/01/ntnu-fusjonerer-med-tre-hogskoler |archive-date=3 April 2016 |access-date=2016-02-25 |website=Khrono}}</ref>

Student culture in Trondheim is characterised by a long-standing tradition of volunteer work. The student society is for example run by more than 1,200 volunteers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Studentersamfundet |url=http://www.samfundet.no/informasjon/omsamfundet.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109182411/http://www.samfundet.no/informasjon/omsamfundet.php |archive-date=9 November 2007 |access-date=18 February 2008 |language=no}}</ref> [[NTNUI]], Norway's largest sports club, is among the other volunteer organisations that dominate student culture in Trondheim. Students in Trondheim are also behind two major Norwegian culture festivals, [[UKA (festival)|UKA]] and [[Isfit|The International Student Festival in Trondheim]] (ISFiT). NTNU lists over 200 student organisations with registered web pages on its servers alone.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NTNU Student Organisations (in Norwegian) |url=http://org.ntnu.no/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306100437/http://org.ntnu.no/ |archive-date=6 March 2008 |access-date=18 February 2008}}</ref>

===In popular culture===
Trondheim culture is parodied on the [[Monty Python]] album ''[[Another Monty Python Record]]'' in the form of the fictitious Trondheim Hammer Dance.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apologies/ Trondheim Hammer Dance |url=http://www.madmusic.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=27618 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207221428/http://www.madmusic.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=27618 |archive-date=7 December 2013 |access-date=12 October 2012 |publisher=madmusic.com}}</ref>

Trondheim is also a key location in the ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' universe, as it is a critical battleground for both factions.

Trondheim was the name of a planet in the Hundred Worlds of the [[Ender's Game (novel series)|''Ender's Game'' novel series]].

Trondheim likely serves as an inspiration for the fictional city Tronjheim in [[The Inheritance Cycle]].

{{Main|Public Transport in Trondheim}}
Trondheim has an international airport, [[Trondheim Airport, Værnes]], situated in [[Stjørdal]], which is Norway's fourth largest airport in terms of passenger traffic. Værnes has non-stop connections to cities such as [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Stockholm]], among others. The domestic route Trondheim – Oslo is among the [[List of busiest passenger air routes|busiest air routes]] in Europe with around 2 million passengers annually.

[[File:Trondheim tram 1.jpg|thumb|right|A tram in Trondheim]]
Major railway connections are the northbound [[Nordland Line]], the eastbound [[Meråker Line]] to [[Åre]] and [[Östersund]] in Sweden, and two southbound connections to Oslo, the [[Røros Line]] and [[Dovre Line]].

The Coastal Express ships ([[Hurtigruten]]: Covering the [[Bergen]]–[[Kirkenes]] stretch of the coast) call at Trondheim, as do many [[cruise ship]]s during the summer season. Since 1994 there is also a fast commuter boat service to [[Kristiansund]], the closest coastal city to the southwest. Every morning the Hurtigruten ships have one southbound and one northbound arrival and departure in Trondheim.

A [[Flakk–Rørvik Ferry|car ferry route]] from the port of Flakk in the northwest of the municipality, connects Trondheim with [[Fosen]]. Various bridge projects over the Trondheim Fjord to replace the ferry have been planned, but none have begun construction.

Trondheim also boasts the northernmost (since closure of [[Arkhangelsk]] tram in 2004) [[tram]]way line in the world: the [[Gråkallen Line]], the last remaining segment of the [[Trondheim Tramway]], is an {{convert|8.8|km}} route (which is mostly single-track outside the innermost parts of the city; except the stretch between Breidablikk and Nordre Hoem stations) which runs from the city centre, through the [[Byåsen]] district, and up to Lian, in the large recreation area [[Bymarka]]. Trondheim boasts the world's only bicycle lift, ''[[Trampe bicycle lift|Trampe]]''.

The bus network, operated by [[AtB]], runs throughout most of the city and its suburbs. A new metro line system went public 3 August 2019. The new transportation system covers the Trondheim area (Trondheim, Malvik, and Melhus). The three metro lines and the city lines that link the city across. The new public transport system becomes flexible, with buses running more often and accommodating more passengers. Fewer travelers must take a detour through the center of Trondheim.

In addition, the Nattbuss (Night Bus) service ensures cheap and effective transport for those enjoying nightlife in the city centre during the weekends. The Nattbus has other prices than ordinary buses. The [[European route E6]] highway passes through the city centre of Trondheim in addition to a motorway bypass along the eastern rim of the city.
