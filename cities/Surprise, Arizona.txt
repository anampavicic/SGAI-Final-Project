'''Surprise''' is a city in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]]. The population was 143,148 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="Census 2020"/> up from 117,517 in [[2010 United States Census|2010]] and just 30,848 in 2000.

Surprise is the spring training location of the [[Kansas City Royals]] and the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball teams.

==History==
The city was founded in 1938 by Flora Mae Statler. Statler was the daughter of another Arizona pioneer, Charles Gillett who helped found [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], specifically as a temperance community. Gillett owned much land in Glendale as well as the [[Verde Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 23, 2005 |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/2899cdd8-2702-40aa-97ae-8dd345a317ab |access-date=April 20, 2024 |website=Nps.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Gillett |first=Charles E. |title=Pioneering |publisher=Brethren Publishing House |year=1929 |location=Elgin, Illinois}}</ref> Surprise officials previously thought the city was founded by Statler's husband, real estate developer and state legislator Homer C.

When Surprise was subdivided to build inexpensive houses for agricultural workers, there were only a few houses and a gas station on the one-square-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) parcel of land. Since then, the town has experienced tremendous growth.<ref>[http://www.surpriseaz.com/index.asp?NID=2 Official Website – Surprise, Arizona<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814231820/http://www.surpriseaz.com/index.asp?NID=2 |date=August 14, 2004 }}</ref> It incorporated as a city in 1960.
