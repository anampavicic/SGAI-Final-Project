'''Basti''' is a city, [[municipal board]] and administrative headquarters of [[Basti district]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The district is part of [[Basti division]]. It is situated 202 kilometres east of the state capital, [[Lucknow]].

==History==
Basti was originally known as Vaishishthi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.majorcitiesofworld.com/where-is-basti-in-uttar-pradesh-india/|title=Where is Basti, Information about Basti, Where is Basti Located in Uttar Pradesh, India|access-date=28 October 2019}}</ref> The origin of the name Vaishishthi is attributed to the fact that this area was the [[ashram]] of Rishi (sage) [[Vashistha]] in ancient period. [[Rama]] with his younger brother [[Lakshmana]] had been here for some time with Rishi Vashistha.

The tract comprising the present district was remote and much of it was covered with forest. But gradually the area became inhabitable, for want of recorded and reliable history it cannot, with any degree of certainty, be said how the district came to be known by its present name on account of the original habitation (Basti) having been selected by the Kalhans Raja Udai Raj Singh as a seat of his Raj, an event which probably occurred in the 16th century. In 1801, Basti became the Tehsil headquarters and in 1865 it was chosen as the headquarters of the newly established district. The region was under the rule of Kalhans dynasty based at modern [[Chaukhara]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Desai |first1=A.
