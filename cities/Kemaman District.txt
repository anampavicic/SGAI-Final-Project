==Geography==
The geographical features of this district can be divided into three main areas which include coastal area, inland area and the foothill area (located only a few kilometres from the beach). The coastal area is a flat lowland with the majority of the people focus on fishing activities. This area stretches about 38 kilometres from Kuala Kemaman to Kerteh. More than half of Kemaman's population is concentrated in this area. The inland area of the district is a region of highlands with hilly features. This area is rich with tin ore, oil palm plantation and timber. So, the concentration of population here is related to local economic activities. The foothill area is the second highest populated area. The area is located between the coastal and the inland areas. The main occupation of the residents in this area is farming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpk.terengganu.gov.my/web/guest/latar-belakang-kemaman?p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_9fnF&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&page=1 |title=Background Of Kemaman - Official Portal Kemaman Municipal Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015233157/http://mpk.terengganu.gov.my/web/guest/latar-belakang-kemaman?p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_9fnF&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&page=1 |archive-date=2014-10-15 }}</ref>

==History==
According to early history, Kemaman was started to be known since the second century BC by the name of ''Kole''. This is based on the map of the ''[[Golden Chersonese]]'' which has been drawn by [[Ptolemy]] (a [[Greek people|Greek]] astronomer and geographer, born in Egypt in the second century BC) noting that there were two ports in the East Coast, Perimula and Kole. Historians agreed that Perimula was the [[Terengganu River]] estuary (present-day [[Kuala Terengganu]]) and Kole was Kemaman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukm.my/jebat/images/upload/Alir%20Muda%207-8.pdf|title=Early History of Kemaman until 1880 (Bahasa Melayu)|access-date=2013-06-17|archive-date=2016-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185922/http://www.ukm.my/jebat/images/upload/Alir%20Muda%207-8.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In spite of that, the history of the opening of this district is still vague as there is no written account and valid evidence about it. Anyway, local historian agreed that the district has begun to be explored about 300 years ago by Che Wan Teh and his followers. Che Wan Teh was from a noble Pahang family who migrated to this district from Kuala Pahang following a disorder and chaos situation in Kuala Pahang. He then set up a settlement in the coastal area and the first village found was Bukit Mengkuang Before the Malays came, the district (this particular area) was occupied by the Sakais who then moved to the inland area.

After sometimes in Bukit Mengkuang, Che Wan Teh moved to a new settlement area adjacent to Kemaman River estuary known as Tanjung Geliga. This new settlement was also unsecured as it was often disturbed by pirates and robbers threat. As a result, Che Wan Teh and his followers moved to another new area on the bank of Kemaman River (about 3 kilometers from Tanjung Geliga). This place was later known as Chukai. This event is strongly proved by existence of an old cemetery in the area. It was said that Che Wan Teh died shortly after opening Kampung Chukai. His followers and generations after him continuously explored new areas following the rise in population and the need for new agricultural areas.

Other than verbal explanation, there was another version which referred to some written accounts relating the opening of Kemaman District with a Pattani aristocrat known as Lebai Saras. Anyway, this version recorded the 19th century early event when Terengganu was under the rule of Sultan Ahmad Shah 1 (1808 – 1830) and indirectly coincides with the opening of Kemaman District by Che Wan Teh.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2015-11-10 |title=Info Kemaman |url=http://mpk.terengganu.gov.my/ms/pelawat/info-kemaman |access-date=2022-12-11 |website=Portal Rasmi Majlis Perbandaran Kemaman (MPK) |language=ms}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpk.terengganu.gov.my/web/guest/latar-belakang-kemaman?p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_9fnF&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&page=2 |title=Background Of Kemaman - Official Portal Kemaman Municipal Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015233817/http://mpk.terengganu.gov.my/web/guest/latar-belakang-kemaman?p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_9fnF&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&page=2 |archive-date=2014-10-15 }}</ref>

==Economy==
Kemaman's economy is primarily based on the petroleum, oil, and steel industries. [[Petronas]]' discovery of oil in offshore Terengganu in the 1980s has attracted immigration to Kemaman from rural areas as well as other parts of the country. Terengganu Petroleum Refineries in [[Kerteh]] are the first refineries owned by Petronas.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Von Der Mehden |first1=Fred R. |last2=Troner |first2=Al |date=March 2007 |title=Petronas History |url=https://masalai.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/petronas_tronervdm.pdf |page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petronas.com.my/our-business/downstream/oil/oil-refining/Pages/kerteh-refinery.aspx|title=Kertih Refinery}}</ref> [[Kemaman Port]] also has a [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG) export terminal managed by Petronas, the national oil corporation. The presence of petroleum and oil industry here also causing this district well developed as well. Traditional industries include fishing, anchovies and salted fish manufacturing which was pioneered by the Chinese. One well known local fishing merchant was Soh Huat Keh who was among the successful pioneers of the salted fish manufacturing industry there. These seafood produces are exported throughout Malaysia and Singapore.

The presence of natural gas has also been the spur for the development of the iron and steel industry in Kemaman. A large steel making company, [[Perwaja]], established [[direct-reduced iron]]/[[electric arc furnace]] (DRI/EAF) facilities, with its own import/export facilities on the [[Kemaman Port|East Wharf]].

==Tourism==
Among the beaches that can be found in this district are Kemasik Beach, Teluk Mak Nik, Telaga Simpul Beach, Cagar Hutan Beach, and Ma'Daerah Beach. Kemaman's beaches used to be nesting grounds for endangered [[green turtle]] and [[painted terrapin]]s. However, due to local desire for turtle eggs, these sea creatures were declared extinct in the area since year 2004. Among serious efforts to get turtles back to nest on the nearby beaches is the setting up of a turtle sanctuary in Ma'Daerah Beach, called Ma'Daerah Turtle Sanctuary, which provides an undisturbed beach for nesting turtles and protection for eggs. This turtle conservation centre is operated under the joint auspices of Department of Fisheries, [[BP]] and [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] Malaysia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ma'Daerah Turtle Sanctuary {{!}} Community {{!}} Home |url=https://www.bp.com/en_my/malaysia/home/community-and-environment/ma-daerah-turtle-sanctuary.html |access-date=2022-12-10 |website=[[BP]]}}</ref>

All kinds of local delicacies, such as satar, nekbat, [[lemang]] and ''[[otak-otak]]'', are sold here and are different from those found in [[Kuala Terengganu]] and unique to Kemaman.

The shop is the original location of the business franchise Kemaman Kopitiam that can be found throughout the country. Halal food has been served in the premises for many years as the Chinese owners have blended well with the Malay community for such a long time.<ref>{{cite web |title=The roads that lead to the Terengganu of old - Malaysia - The Star Online |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Travel/Malaysia/2013/07/24/The-roads-that-lead-to-the-Terengganu-of-old/ |website=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}</ref>
