The city is the 7th most populous city in Tamaulipas and the 91st most populous city in Mexico. The city has experienced one of the largest demographic growths in the state of Tamaulipas due to its physical conurbation with the city of Tampico. As Tampico lacks additional municipal space, it has extended its limits and influence over the city of Miramar, which, being located in the vast territory of the municipality of Altamira, receives all the new population arriving in the Tampico Metropolitan Area. This has resulted in Miramar growing from a rural population of fewer than 2,000 inhabitants in the 1980s to one of the main urban centers in the state, with a population nearing 200,000 inhabitants. It is expected that in the coming decades, it will become the most populous city in the Tampico Metropolitan Area. Miramar has a fertility rate of 1.84 children per woman; the average level of schooling is 10.12 years; and 3.94 percent of the population is indigenous.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Censo de Población y Vivienda 2020 |url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/ccpv/2020/default.html |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=www.inegi.org.mx}}</ref>
