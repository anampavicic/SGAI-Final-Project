'''Jaén''' ({{IPA|es|xaˈen|lang|Pronunciation_of_Jaén_in_Spanish.ogg}}) is a [[Municipalities in Spain|municipality of Spain]] and the capital of the [[Jaén Province, Spain|province of Jaén]], in the autonomous community of [[Andalusia]].

The city of Jaén is the administrative and industrial centre for the province. Industrial establishments in the city include chemical works, [[tanneries]], [[distilleries]], cookie factories, textile factories, as well as agricultural and [[olive oil]] processing machinery industry.

The layout of Jaén is determined by its position on the foothills of the Cerro de Santa Catalina, with steep, narrow streets, in the historic core.

Its population is 112,757 (2020), about one-sixth of the population of the province. Recently Jaén has had a great increase in cultural tourism, having received 604,523 tourists along the year 2015, 10% more than in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideal.es/jaen/provincia-jaen/201602/08/jaen-recibe-turistas-2015-20160207200352.html|title=(In spanish language) Jaén recibe 604.523 turistas en 2015, 55.000 más que hace un año|date=7 February 2016|publisher=Ideal.es|access-date=11 February 2016}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name is most likely derived from the Roman name ''Villa Gaiena'' ([[Villa]] of Gaius). It was called '''Jayyān''' during the time of [[Al-Andalus]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=García |first=Eduardo José Jacinto |title=La Toponimia de Jaén en las Fuentes Árabes Medievales: Aproximación Lingüistica |url=http://fhyc.unileon.es/SEL/actas/Jacinto.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417040534/http://fhyc.unileon.es/SEL/actas/Jacinto.pdf |archive-date=2018-04-17 |website=fhyc.unileon.es |language=es}}</ref>

The inhabitants of the city are known as ''Jienenses''.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Jaén, Spain}}
[[File:Jaén - Muralla calcolítica.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Chalcolithic]] walls in Marroquíes Bajos]]
The area was populated since ancient times, with remains of city walls in the {{ill|Marroquíes Bajos|es}} site in the north of the city reportedly dating back in time to the [[Chalcolithic]], roughly four millennia ago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2009/11/13/andalucia/1258068144_850215.html|website=[[El País]]|date=13 November 2009|title=Hallada en Jaén una muralla calcolítica de 4.000 años|last1=Donaire|first1=Ginés}}</ref>

Known by Roman sources as ''Aurgi'' ({{Smallcaps|avrgi}}), similar names such as {{Smallcaps|avringi}}, {{Smallcaps|oringi}}, are also identified as referring to the same place.{{Sfn|Pestaña Parras|2011|p=4}} The city was seized by [[Scipio Africanus]] away from [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] by 207 BC, in the context of the [[Second Punic War]].{{Sfn|Pestaña Parras|2011|p=1}} Following the Roman conquest, as former allies of the Punics, the city had the status of {{lang|la|[[civitas stipendaria]]}} (required to pay tribute and under military rule), probably enduring harsh conditions in this period.{{Sfn|Pestaña Parras|2011|p=7}} During the [[Roman Empire]], in the time of the [[Flavian dynasty]], ''Aurgi'' became a ''[[municipium]]'',{{Sfn|Pestaña Parras|2011|p=1}} {{Smallcaps|avrgi mvnicipivm flavivm}}.{{Sfn|Pestaña Parras|2011|p=9}}

Following the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]], the name of ''Ŷaīyyān'' (of unclear origin) was mentioned in Hispano-Arab sources already in the 8th century.{{Sfn|Vallvé Bermejo|1969|p=55}} Close to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], the city became the head of an important {{ill|kura (demarcation)|es|Cora (división territorial)|lt=''kūra''}} in the emiral/caliphal period of [[Al-Andalus]], extending across a territory with some similarities to the [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|current province]].{{Sfn|Gutiérrez Pérez|2019|pp=35–36}} During the turbulent 11th century, in the context of the [[Fitna of al-Andalus]], the wider ''kūra'' was territory in dispute between the most powerful neighbouring taifas, such as Córdoba, Granada or Toledo, splitting up its territory.{{Sfn|Martos Quesada|2013|p=89}} Jaén was conquered by [[Habbus al-Muzaffar]], leader of the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] [[Taifa of Granada]].{{Sfn|Espinar Moreno|2000|pp=60; 160}} Decades after the final demise of the caliphate of Córdoba, Jaén was conquered by the [[Almoravid]]s in 1091.{{Sfn|Vidal Castro|2003|p=77}}

Taken in 1159 by [[Abu ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Saʿd ibn Mardanīš|Ibn Mardanīš]] (the ''Rey Lobo'', ruler of Valencia opposed to the spread of the [[Almohad Empire]]), his collaborator (and father-in-law) [[Ibn Hamušk]] surrendered and yielded Jaén to the almohads in 1169.{{Sfn|Vidal Castro|2009–2011|p=65}}

In 1225, [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] [[Siege of Jaén (1225)|unsuccessfully laid siege to the city]] (defended by strong walls built during the Almoravid period) with help from {{ill|Al-Bayyasi|es}}, ruler of the [[Taifa of Baeza]], that had just become a vassal state of the [[Kingdom of Castile]].{{Sfn|Eslava Galán|1987|pp=25–26}} [[Siege of Jaén (1230)|The city was besieged again in 1230]] by Ferdinand,{{Sfn|Eslava Galán|1987|p=13}} who lifted the siege after the news of the death of his father, [[Alfonso IX of León]]. Depleted from its defences and surrounding fields, the city was surrendered by [[Muhammad I of Granada]] to Ferdinand III on 28 February 1246.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eslava Galán|1987|pp=13–14}}; {{Harvnb|Alcázar Hernández|2003|p=257}}</ref> Also in 1246, the city was granted a ''[[fuero]]'' (charter) similar to that of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], becoming in turn the model for the fueros granted to [[Jódar]] (1272), [[Arjona, Spain|Arjona]] (1284), [[Alcalá la Real]] (1341) and [[Priego de Córdoba|Priego]] (1341).{{Sfn|Chamocho Cantudo|2017|pp=16–17}} Following the conquest, by 1248–49, the [[Diocese of Baeza]] was moved to Jaén.{{Sfn|Alcázar Hernández|2003|p=266}}

For the rest of the Middle Ages, the ''concejo'' or {{ill|Comunidad de Villa y Tierra|es|lt=''comunidad de villa y tierra''}} of Jaén controlled a land that ranged from 1000 to 1600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, roughly delimited by the [[Guadalquivir]] to the North, the Arroyovil to the East, the Arroyo Salado de los Villares to the West, and the Sierra Sur de Jaén and [[Sierra Mágina]] mountain ranges to the South.{{Sfn|Alcázar Hernández|2003|p=256}} Despite nominally featuring as the head of the [[Kingdom of Jaén]] since the conquest, the importance of Jaén within the demarcation was balanced by those of the cities of Baeza and [[Úbeda]].{{Sfn|Collantes de Terán Sánchez|2004|p=70}} It only began to stand out in relation to its growing strategic importance closer to the border with the [[Kingdom of Granada]], consolidating its military and administrative functions.{{Sfn|Collantes de Terán Sánchez|2004|p=70}} Unlike those cities, that developed an important textile craftmanship activity, Jaén's economic activity remained nonetheless largely agricultural well entered the Early Modern period.{{Sfn|Collantes de Terán Sánchez|2004|p=71}}

==Intitulation==
The intitulation of the city is: ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) "La Muy Noble y muy Leal Ciudad de Jaén, Guarda y Defendimiento de los Reynos<!--not a spelling mistake, see the arms--> de Castilla", ([[English language|English]]) "The Very Noble and very Loyal City of Jaén, Guard and Defense of the Kingdoms of Castile," a title that was given to the city by King [[Henry II of Castile|Enrique II]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] to the city of Jaén, due to the privileges that the city had, and to the role that the city was playing in the defense of the [[Kingdom of Castile]] against the Arabs.

[[File:PHTO0104.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Castle of Santa Catalina (Jaén)|Saint Catalina's castle]].]]
[[File:Jaén Cathedral.png|thumb|left|upright|Jaén Cathedral.]]

''[[Castle of Santa Catalina (Jaén)|Saint Catherine's Castle]]'' (Castillo de Santa Catalina) sits on the top of a hill overlooking the city. Previously there had existed a fortress of Arabic origin (Abrehui's castle), of which some remains still exist. The current construction is of Christian origin, raised after the [[Siege of Jaén (1245-46)|conquest of the city]] by [[Ferdinand III of Castile]], called the Saint, in 1246.

[[Jaén Cathedral]] is one of the most important [[Renaissance]]-style [[cathedral]]s. Construction began in 1570 and was completed in 1802. It is dedicated to the [[Assumption of the Virgin]], and it was built to shelter the [[relic]] of the [[Holy Face]], or [[Veil of Veronica]], lodged at the major chapel and exposed to the public every Friday. Due to the length of time in its construction,  different artistic styles can be appreciated, the most prominent being Renaissance; Andrés de Vandelvira the most important architect. He is the greatest exponent of the Andalusian Renaissance. It aspires to be listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

The [[Arab Baths of Jaén|Arab Baths]] (''Baños Arabes'') in Jaén are among the largest [[Turkish bath|Islamic bathhouses]] preserved in [[Spain]]. They can be visited under Villardompardo's Palace (another important landmark in the city).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Baños Árabes|url=https://www.xn--baosarabesjaen-rnb.es/work/banos-arabes/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=www.xn--baosarabesjaen-rnb.es}}</ref> These Arab baths had the function in their origins of purifying all the visitors who entered the city of Jaén. However, nowadays they are not in use, being a great tourist and historical attraction.<ref>{{cite web |title=Los mejores planes para viajar por España en familia |url=https://www.vipealo.com/blog/los-mejores-planes-para-viajar-por-espana-en-familia/ |website=Vipealo |date=29 December 2020 |access-date=29 December 2020}}</ref>

Other important landmarks are the ''Museum of Arts and Popular Customs'', the ''International Museum of Naïf Art'', ''San Andrés's Chapel'', the ''Provincial Museum of Jaén'' (which shelters an important collection of archaeological Iberian remains), ''Saint Ildefonso's church'', ''[[La Magdalena, Jaén|La Magdalena]]'' church, etc.

===Music===
The most important event is the International Piano Competition Premio Jaén (in Spanish: Concurso Internacional de Piano Premio Jaén) that is the oldest and most important piano competition in Spain. It started in 1953 with Pablo Castillo García-Negrete, an architect who began to donate the first cash prizes of only some thousands of pesetas. Nowadays the prize consist of €57,000 and the recording of classical music albums in professional studios. The last winner of this significant competition was the Chinese pianist Yin Yu Qin, in 2008, in the fiftieth competition.

There are other events such as the Ciclos de Rock and the Lagarto Rock Festival.

===Language===
The language spoken in Jaén is the official language of Spain, Spanish. The variety of Spanish spoken in this province displays some of the characteristics of [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian]] speech, such as dropping of final -s in plural formation: ''gafa'' for gafas (and consequent final vowel opening) in the word "glasses", or dropping of /d/ in intervocalic position in regular participles of verbs: e.g. ''acabao'' for ''acabado''. Some of these variants can be consulted in the ''Diccionario de Vocabulario Andaluz'' compiled by the local lexicographer Alcalá Venceslada, which was reprinted by the University of Jaén some years ago. This dictionary also compiles some other variants of Andalusian present in other parts of the autonomous community.

There are different expressions typical of the area, namely the interjection "¡ea!" (also present in other dialectal variants) which has no particular exact meaning or "¡lavística!" /la'vistika/, which is believed to be a contraction of the expression "la [[Vírgen de Tíscar]]", a popular virgin of the province, although there are no exact data to confirm the origin of the last expression which is, nevertheless, widespread among speakers of the province.

===Leisure and entertainment===
====Festivals====
Feria de San Lucas: On 18 October Jaén celebrates his biggest festivity. It lasts more than a week where jienenses and visitors can enjoy music, Sevillanas dancing, gastronomy, culture and tradition.

Romeria de Santa Catalina: Procession in the hill with the same name where the Castle is located to honour the Saint Patron of the City. It is typical to eat sardines and barbecue in the forest around the Castle.

San Anton: The 16 January it is celebrated the fires of [[Anthony the Great|San Anton]]. In the different neighbourhoods there are built bonfires and people eat and sing around them celebrating the beginning of the year. Also  the International Urban Race of San Anton takes place that night, the fifth in the Spanish Ranking of Athleticism.

Virgen de la Capilla: The 11 June Jaén celebrates the appearance of the Virgin Mary in the city. A weekend where there are flower offerings and a Virgin procession, as well as traditional activities to show the culture of the city.

Holy Week: The tradition of celebrating the Holy Week in the city started in the Middle Ages, and nowadays it has been declared "Bien de Interés Turístico-Cultural Andaluz" since 2006 and "Fiesta de Interés Turístico Nacional de Andalucía". From Palm Sunday until Resurrection Sunday 17 catholic brotherhoods carry out their processions through the streets of Jaén.
