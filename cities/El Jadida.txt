'''El Jadida''' ({{Langx|ar|الجديدة|al-Jadīda}}, {{IPA|ar|alʒadiːda|}}) is a major port city on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[Morocco]], located {{convert|96|km}} south of the city of [[Casablanca]], in the province of [[El Jadida (province)|El Jadida]] and the region of [[Casablanca-Settat]].<ref name="region-1" /><ref name="region-2" /> It has a population of 170,956 as of 2023.<ref name="population-2022-1" />{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2023|certain=yes|reason=There is no census in 2023 but the site claims this was counted in 2023, and it said the same number in 2022.

The fortified city, built by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] at the beginning of the 16th century and named Mazagan (''Mazagão'' in Portuguese), was given up by the Portuguese in 1769 and incorporated into Morocco.

==History==
{{see also|Siege of Mazagan (1562)}}
[[File:خريطة مازاغان 1942.jpg|thumb|Map of Mazagan created by the US government in 1942|left]]
El Jadida traces its origins to the 5th century BC, when it was founded and settled by the [[Phoenicia]]ns.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Porter |first=Darwin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTtDmE4_MZgC |title=Frommer's Spain and Morocco on Forty Dollars a Day |date=1987 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated |isbn=978-0-671-62061-5 |pages=517 |language=en}}</ref>

Prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, an anchorage used by boats appears to have existed at the current site of El Jadida throughout the Middle Ages and in ancient times.<ref name=":052">{{Cite book |last1=Colin |first1=G.S. |title=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition |last2=Cenival |first2=P. de |publisher=Brill |year=1960–2007 |isbn=9789004161214 |editor-last=Bearman |editor-first=P. |location= |pages= |chapter=al-D̲j̲adīda |editor-last2=Bianquis |editor-first2=Th. |editor-last3=Bosworth |editor-first3=C.E. |editor-last4=van Donzel |editor-first4=E. |editor-last5=Heinrichs |editor-first5=W.P.}}</ref> The name ''Mazighan'' was first documented by the 11th-century Arab geographer [[al-Bakri]].<ref name=":052" /> In 1502 a Portuguese captain, Jorge de Mello, landed at this location, allegedly driven here by a storm. He and his crew took refuge in an abandoned tower, called ''al-Briya'' or ''al-Burayja,'' to defend themselves against any potential attack by the locals.<ref name=":052" /><ref name=":0" /> After returning to Portugal, he obtained permission from the Portuguese king, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Dom Manuel]], to found a fortress here in 1505, but evidence indicates that he did not carry this out, as when the Portuguese army passed here on their way to conquer [[Azemmour]] in 1513 they found nothing but the old tower.<ref name=":052" />

As Azemmour was difficult to access, the Portuguese returned and built a citadel at the more accessible Mazighan in the summer of 1514.<ref name=":052" /> This citadel was a rectangular building with four towers, one of which was the old tower that already stood here.<ref name=":052" /><ref name=":0" /> The architects were two brothers, Diogo and Francisco de Arruda.<ref name=":052" /><ref name=":3" /> The location then became known in the [[Portuguese language]] as ''Mazagão''. During the next few decades the [[Saadi Sultanate|Sa'dids]] rose to power and began expelling the Portuguese from their coastal fortresses, with the most significant event being their [[Fall of Agadir|expulsion from Santa Cruz]] (present-day [[Agadir]]) in 1541. In response, [[John III of Portugal|King João III of Portugal]] ordered the evacuation of Portuguese positions at Azemmour and [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] and concentrated on building a more defensible position at Mazagão instead.<ref name=":052" /> As a result, the Portuguese fortification was expanded into the larger walled fortress we see today in 1541.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":052" />

The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] would continue to control the city until 1769, when they abandoned Mazagão, their last territory in Morocco. Upon their forced departure, the Portuguese destroyed the Governor's Bastion. Most of the Portuguese inhabitants were sent to the [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]], where they founded a new settlement called [[Mazagão Velho|''Nova Mazagão'']] (the present [[Mazagão]] in the state of [[Amapá]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mazagão, la ville qui traversa l'Atlantique : du Maroc à l'Amazonie, 1769-1783|last=Jean Duvignaud|first=Laurent Vidal|publisher=Aubier|year=2005|isbn=2-70072360-0|location=Paris|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/luso/15/1/article-p242_31.xml|page=314}}</ref> The city was then taken over by Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] in 1769 and remained largely uninhabited, having been dubbed ''al-Mahdouma'' ('The Ruined').<ref name=":0" /> Eventually, Sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Abd al-Rahman]] (r. 1822–1859) ordered that a mosque be built, and the destroyed portions of the city were rebuilt during his reign in the early nineteenth-century.<ref name=":0" /> In 1820 the city was renamed ''al-Jadida'', meaning 'The New'.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Sarmento |first=João |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfUFDAAAQBAJ&dq=el+jadida+tourism&pg=PA128 |title=Fortifications, Post-colonialism and Power: Ruins and Imperial Legacies |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-317-13387-2 |pages=128–133 |language=en}}</ref> The town underwent a revival and soon outgrew Azemmour as the most important city in the area.

At the beginning of the [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Protectorate in Morocco]] (established in 1912), the city was developed as a tourist resort, one of the earliest initiatives to develop modern tourism in Morocco.<ref name=":5" /> By the 1930s it had a casino which was popular with European tourists and colonists.<ref name=":5" /> The importance of the city's port, however, declined as [[Casablanca]] grew into the major port and urban center of the country during this period.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suárez Bosa |first=Miguel |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohrxDwAAQBAJ&dq=el+jadida+port+economy&pg=PA99 |title=African Seaports and Maritime Economics in Historical Perspective |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2020 |isbn=978-3-030-41399-6 |editor-last=Olukoju |editor-first=Ayodeji |pages=99 |language=en |chapter=Modernization and Development of the Moroccan Port Model during the French Protectorate (1912–1956) |editor-last2=Hidalgo |editor-first2=Daniel Castillo}}</ref><ref name=":4" /> In the 1980s a large industrial complex, [[Jorf Lasfar]], was developed some 20 kilometres to the south.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book |last1=Godin |first1=Lucien |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgNQEAAAQBAJ&dq=el+jadida+port+economy&pg=PT228 |title=The Medina: The Restoration and Conservation of Historic Islamic Cities |last2=Le Bihan |first2=Gérard |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-78672-497-7 |editor-last=Balbo |editor-first=Marcello |language=en |chapter=Moroccan Medinas: Meknes and Azemmour}}</ref> Aided by its [[UNESCO World heritage site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] designation since 2004, the city continues to be a tourist destination today.<ref name=":5" />

During the [[2023 Marrakesh–Safi earthquake|September 2023 earthquake]] that struck southern Morocco, the historic Portuguese church in the old city was damaged.

===Fortress of Mazagan===
The design of the Fortress of Mazagan is a response to the development of modern artillery in the Renaissance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/1058rev.pdf |title=Portuguese City of Mazagan (El Jadida) - UNESCO Advisory Body Evaluation |access-date=2013-02-10}}</ref> The star form of the fortress measures ''c'' 250m by 300m.<ref>{{Cite web|title=DGPC {{!}} Cidade Portuguesa de Mazagão (El Jadida)|url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-mundial/origem-portuguesa/cidade-portuguesa-de-mazagao-el-jadida/|access-date=2020-12-07|website=www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt}}</ref> The slightly inclined, massive walls are ''c'' 8m high on average, with a thickness of 10m, enclosing a patrolling peripheral walkway 2m wide. At the present time the fortification has four bastions: the Angel Bastion in the east, St Sebastian in the north, St Antoine in the west, and the Holy Ghost Bastion in the south. The fifth, the Governor's Bastion at the main entrance, is in ruins, having been destroyed by the Portuguese in 1769. Numerous colonial-era Portuguese cannons are still positioned on top of the bastions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fortress of Mazagan |url=http://www.starforts.com/mazagan.html |website=Starforts |access-date=May 25, 2020}}</ref>

The fort had three gates: the Seagate, forming a small port with the north-east rampart, the Bull Gate in the north-west rampart, and the main entrance with a double arch in the centre of the south rampart, originally connected to land via a drawbridge. A ditch, ''c'' 20m wide and 3m deep, formerly filled with seawater, surrounded the fort. During the time of the [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Protectorate]] the ditch was filled in with earth and a new entrance gate was opened leading to the main street, the Rua da Carreira, and to the Seagate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} Along this street are situated the best preserved historic buildings, including the Catholic Church of the Assumption and the [[Portuguese Cistern (Mazagan)|Portuguese cistern]].

==== The Citadel ====
[[File:El Jadida DSCF9091.jpg|thumb|[[Portuguese Cistern (Mazagan)|Portuguese cistern]] under the citadel of Mazagan, in [[Manueline]] style]]
The Citadel, located at the heart of the walled city, was the first permanent Portuguese construction on this site in 1514. It is a building with a rectangular floor plan measuring about {{convert|47 by 56|m|ft}}, with three major rooms around a central space and four towers (one at each corner).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |url=https://whc.unesco.org/document/168852 |title=Proposition d'inscription de biens sur la Liste du patrimoine mondial: Cité portugaise Mazagan (El Jadida) |year=2004 |language=fr |type=Nomination text for UNESCO World Heritage List}}</ref> The southern El-Briya Tower (originally known as ''al-Burayja'') was of local, pre-Portuguese origin and it was here that the Portuguese first took refuge when they arrived in 1502.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":052" /> One of the northern towers was later re-purposed as the base of a 19th-century minaret built for the nearby mosque.<ref name=":0" /> The cistern is located beneath the Citadel.

==== Portuguese cistern ====
The semi-subterranean chamber has a roughly square plan measuring around {{convert|33 to 34|m|ft}} per side, was constructed with five rows of five stone pillars and columns.<ref name=":0" /> The chamber is built in a late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style known as [[Manueline]], with a [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] ceiling of brick masonry and stone [[Rib vault|ribs]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=Portuguese City of Mazagan (El Jadida) |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1058/ |access-date=May 25, 2020 |website=Unesco}}</ref> Its original function is not clear. It may have been an armory, barracks,<ref name=":1" /> or granary,<ref name=":052" /> but it is recorded as having been converted into a cistern in 1541.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":052" /> It was designed by an architect named Miguel de Arruda but the construction work was delegated to João de Castilho.<ref name=":1">{{Cite sign |title=La citerne |year= |date=9 June 2015 |type=Information sign |publisher= |location=Posted inside museum, at entrance of cistern |author=}}</ref> A round opening in the center of the chamber served to collect rainwater.<ref name=":0" /> The cistern is famous especially for the thin layer of water that covers the floor and creates fine and ever-changing reflections in the otherwise dark vaulted chamber. Its visual qualities are such that several movies have been filmed within the cavernous space, of which [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Othello (1952 film)|Othello]]'' is the best known internationally.<ref>{{cite web |title=Portuguese Cistern of El Jadida |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/portuguese-cistern-of-el-jadida |website=Atlas Obscura |access-date=May 25, 2020}}</ref>

==== Churches ====
[[File:El Jadida DSCF8969.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Church of the Assumption (El Jadida)|Church of Our Lady of Assumption]]]]
The [[Church of the Assumption (El Jadida)|Church of Our Lady of the Assumption]], a prominent building located south of the Citadel, was the main [[parish church]] of the Portuguese settlement. It was constructed or begun when the fortress was expanded in 1541. It has a nave, a choir, a sacristy, and a square-shafted bell tower.<ref name=":0" /> At least three other churches existed, though generally only partial remains of them are still present today. Two small churches were adjoined to some of the bastions of the fortress. Another, the Church of Mercy (''Misericórdia'') was part of the Citadel.<ref name=":0" />

==== Synagogues ====
[[File:Mazagan synagogue.jpg|thumb|The Bensimon Synagogue, built along the northeastern ramparts]]
A number of synagogues also existed inside the old city, attesting to the importance of the Jewish community here in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=":0" /> One prominently visible example is the Bensimon Synagogue, inaugurated in 1926 and attached to earlier structures in the northern corner of the former fortress. Its construction was sponsored by four brothers of the Bensimon family: Nessim, Messaoud, Abraham, and Mordechai.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Choukaili |first=Khadija |date=26 February 2019 |title=El Jadida: Projet de réhabilitation de la synagogue Bensimon |url=https://eljadidascoop.com/el-jadida-projet-de-rehabilitation-de-la-synagogue-bensimon/ |access-date=9 October 2022 |website=El Jadida Scoop |language=fr}}</ref>

=== Museum of Resistance and Independence ===
Located near the beach south of the old city and the port, this museum and exhibition space is dedicated to the memory of Moroccan soldiers and resistance to the French Protectorate regime. It is housed in a 20th-century colonial era building constructed in a "Mauresque" style.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Museum of Resistance And Independence |url=https://www.infostourismemaroc.com/en/monument/museum-of-resistance-and-independence-el-jadida-morocco |access-date=2022-10-09 |website=Morocco Tourism Info |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=El Jadida a son musée de la Résistance et de l'armée de libération – Mazagan24 – Portail d'El Jadida |url=https://mazagan24.com/2015/09/20/el-jadida-a-son-musee-de-la-resistance-et-de-larmee-de-liberation/,%20https://mazagan24.com/2015/09/20/el-jadida-a-son-musee-de-la-resistance-et-de-larmee-de-liberation/ |access-date=2022-10-09 |language=fr-FR}}</ref>
