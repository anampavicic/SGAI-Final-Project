'''Torrejón de Ardoz''' ({{IPA|es|toreˈxon de aɾˈðoθ}}) is a [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] of [[Spain]] belonging to the [[Community of Madrid]].

The [[European Union Satellite Centre]] (SatCen), an [[agency of the European Union]], is located in Torrejón de Ardoz. It is also the location of the headquarters of the [[Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial]] (INTA), the Spanish [[space agency]].

The [[Torrejón Air Base]]/[[Madrid–Torrejón Airport]] also lies on the municipality.

== Etymology ==
''Torrejón'' comes from ''torre'' ("tower"); the suffix ''-jón'' is a [[diminutive]] that ultimately makes reference to the small or unimportant nature of the noun.{{Sfn|Cruz Plaza|García Lledó|Martín-Serrano García|1991|p=754}} The ''Ardoz'' add-on comes from the namesake creek.{{Sfn|Cruz Plaza|García Lledó|Martín-Serrano García|1991|p=754}}

== History ==
While there is no certainty of the origin of Torrejón de Ardoz, it probably dates from the 12th century, associated to fortifications built to protect [[Alcalá de Henares]].<ref>[http://www.ayto-torrejon.es/plantilla.asp?nPagina=1&ccClave=29 Torrejón Townhall website] {{in lang|es}}</ref> It was part of the Land of Alcalá for all purposes until 1554, when it was granted the status of town.{{Sfn|Cruz Plaza|García Lledó|Martín-Serrano García|1991|p=754}}

In 1843 it was the place of a short battle between general [[Ramón María Narváez, 1st Duke of Valencia|Ramón Narvaez]] and senator [[Antonio Seoane]], as part of the rebellion against [[Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara|Espartero]].<ref>[http://www.ayto-torrejon.es/plantilla.asp?nPagina=1&ccClave=30 Torrejón Townhall website] {{in lang|es}}</ref>

The [[United States Air Force]] jointly occupied the Torrejón Air Base, installed in 1955,{{Sfn|Alpuente|1997}} under agreements made with [[Francisco Franco]]. The base was subject of criticism since its beginnings and a meeting place of pacifist demonstrations attended by progressives and ecologists.{{Sfn|Alpuente|1997}}

One of the election platforms of [[Felipe González]]'s [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) was to close the base to the American fighter wing. Once González became prime minister, the lease of the then 401st Tactical Fighter Wing (now the [[401st Air Expeditionary Group]]) was not renewed and the [[F-16]] fighter wing left the base in the early 1990s.
