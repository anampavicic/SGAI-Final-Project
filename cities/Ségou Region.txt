'''Ségou Region''' ([[Bambara language|Bambara]]: ߛߋߓߎ ߘߌߣߋߖߊ tr. Segu Dineja) is an administrative region in [[Mali]], situated in the centre of the country with an area of {{convert|64821|km2|abbr=on}}, around 5% of Mali. The region is bordered by [[Sikasso Region]] on the south, [[Tombouctou Region|Tombouctou]] and [[Mopti Region|Mopti]] on the east, [[Burkina Faso]] to the southeast and the [[Koulikoro Region]] to the west. In 2009 it had 2,336,255 inhabitants, making it the second most populous region of Mali. Its administrative capital is the town of [[Ségou]].

==Climate==
The Ségou Region is characterized by a semi-arid climate and irrigated by two important waterways: the Niger and the [[Bani River]], allowing [[irrigation]] for [[agriculture]]. Ségou has two seasons: a rainy season and a dry season. The rainy season starts in June and lasts about four months until September. On the other hand, the dry season includes a cold period and a period of heat. The average yearly rainfall is about {{convert|513|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. The [[harmattan]] is the dominant wind in the dry season and it blows from north to south. The monsoon blowing from south to north-west is more frequent during the rainy season (''hivernage'').<ref name="regionc">Caractéristiques physiques Retrieved May 29, 2007 from http://region.segou.net/caracteristique.htm</ref>

==Demography==
With a rural population that is largely nomadic semi-sedentary or sedentary, the population consists of many [[ethnic]] groups such as the [[Bambara people|Bambara]], Bozo, [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Mandinka people|Malinké]] and [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]]. Bambaras are mostly farmers and are the most numerous ethnic group. Their language is Bambara or [[Djoula]]. The Bozos are the second most populous ethnic group. They live in the borders of Niger, in small towns constituted of small houses. The Bozos economy is based on fishing. Bozo people have a monopoly on the transport system because of their knowledge in the river by Niger, and are regarded as the masters of water. The [[Somono]], also fishermen, are not a distinct ethnic group but a mixture of the Bambara, Bozo and Soninke. The Malinké, Maninka, and Mandinka are closely related to Bambaras. They have the same costumes, beliefs and religious practices as the Bambaras. The [[Marka people|Marka]], [[Saracollé]] and  Soninke are merchants and warriors.

==Economy==
Today, Ségou is known for its [[pottery]],  [[Market (place)|market]] and  [[fishing]] industry.  Attractions in the old town of Ségou-Koro included a [[mosque]], Coulibaly's tomb and an ancient tree.  In the city center, the main landmark is the [[water tower]].

The main economic activities of the Ségou region are agri-business, cattle farming and fishing. The Ségou people apply essential traditional farming methods. Ségou produces the major part of [[Mali]]'s national food, including  sedentary cattle farming. The economy is essentially informal as it is oriented towards the population's primary needs, while industrial production is weak and based in the food industry. Large scale [[agribusiness]] consists of three factories, COMATEX, CMDT and SUKALA. Commerce consists mostly of the small scale exchange and sale by of products from the primary sector, sold weekly at the large Ségou market, drawing customers from far outside of the city. The main products sold are vegetables, pottery, cotton, gold, leather, fruits, ovens, cattle and cereals.<ref name="activite">Activités économiques.
