'''Rishon LeZion''' ({{langx|he|רִאשׁוֹן לְצִיּוֹן}} <small>{{Audio|Rishon lezion.ogg|(audio)}}</small>, {{lit}} "First to [[Zion]]") is a city in [[Israel]], located along the central [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Israeli coastal plain]] {{convert|8|km|mi|0|spell=in}} south of [[Tel Aviv]]. It is part of the [[Gush Dan]] [[metropolitan area]].

Founded in 1882 by Jewish immigrants from the [[Russian Empire]] who were part of the [[First Aliyah]], it was the first Zionist settlement founded in Israel by the [[New Yishuv]] and the second Jewish farm settlement established in [[Ottoman Syria]] in the 19th century, after [[Petah Tikva]]. As of 2017, it was the [[List of cities in Israel|fourth-largest city]] in Israel, with a population of {{Israel populations|Rishon Leziyyon}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/ishuvim/reshimalefishem.pdf|website=Cbs.gov.il|access-date=23 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120155307/http://www.cbs.gov.il/ishuvim/reshimalefishem.pdf|archive-date=20 November 2018|title=Oops, Something is wrong}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Rishon LeZion is derived from a verse from the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]]: "First to Zion are they, and I shall give herald to Jerusalem" {{nowrap|({{langx|he|ראשון לציון הנה הינם, ולירושלים מבשר אתן}})}} ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 41:27) and literally translates as "First to [[Zion]]".

==History==
[[File:Rishon LeZion1 (before 1899).jpg|thumb|Rishon LeZion in the 1890s]]

===Ottoman period (1882–1900)===
[[File:Rishon LeZion 1937.jpg|thumb|Rishon LeZion in 1937]]
Rishon LeZion was founded on 31 July 1882, by ten [[Hovevei Zion]] pioneers from [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]] (then the [[Russian Empire]]) headed by Zalman David Levontin. [[Reuven Yudalevich]] was also a member of the group. The British vice-consul in [[Jaffa]], Haim Amzaleg, purchased {{convert|835|acres|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of land southeast of present-day [[Tel Aviv]], the site of watering holes called ‘Uyūn Qārā (literally 'fountain of the crier') from Mustafa Abdallah ali Dajan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/eng/Pages/HistoryofRishonLeZion.aspx |title=History of Rishon LeZion |publisher=Rishon LeZion municipality |access-date=4 February 2014 |archive-date=20 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320162853/http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/eng/pages/historyofrishonlezion.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to Marom, ‘Uyūn Qārā offered "a convenient launching pad for early land purchase initiatives which shaped the pattern of Jewish settlement until the beginning of the British Mandate". Amzaleg signed a declaration to the settlers stating that none of the structures on this land would ever be his own.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Marom |first=Roy |date=2022-11-01 |title=Jindās: A History of Lydda's Rural Hinterland in the 15th to the 20th Centuries CE |url=https://www.academia.edu/90931976 |journal=Lod, Lydda, Diospolis |volume=1 |pages=26}}</ref>

In addition to the problems posed by sandy soil and lack of water, the newcomers had no agricultural experience. [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]] brought in experts who drilled for water, finding the groundwater table uneven. Wells were built at a depth of 20–25 meters.<ref name=Calif/>

After the [[Bilu (movement)|Biluim]] arrived, the town slowly began to develop. On 23 February 1883, the settlers found water in the wells. To mark this occasion, the village emblem was inscribed with a verse from the [[Torah]]: "We have found water." (Genesis 26:32) Fani Belkind, [[Israel Belkind]], Shimshon Belkind, [[Yoel Drubin]], Haim Hissin, and David Yudilovich were among the Biluim who arrived in Rishon Lezion at this time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Silver |first=Matthew Mark |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdfkDwAAQBAJ |title=Zionism and the Melting Pot: Preachers, Pioneers, and Modern Jewish Politics |date=2020-07-07 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-2062-1 |pages=114 |language=en}}</ref>

In 1883, Itzhak Leib Toporovski a blacksmith of the young village created the first iron [[plow]] in the land of Israel, and in 1885 the flag that would later become the [[flag of Israel]] was raised for the first time as part of the celebrations of the 3rd anniversary of the village.<ref name=muni>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/odot/skira_historit/moshava_1882-1922/Pages/default.aspx|title=עיריית ראשון לציון - ראשון לציון בתקופת המושבה 1882-1922|website=Rishonlezion.muni.il|access-date=2 March 2019|archive-date=12 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112194618/http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/odot/skira_historit/moshava_1882-1922/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref>

When Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] took over, sending in his administrators and agricultural guide Shaul Helzner of [[Mikveh Israel|Mikve Israel]], major progress was made in the spheres of agriculture, citrus and viticulture. In November 1883 the first rows were planted, led by ten Russian farmers who were further trained at [[Mikveh Israel]] agriculture school, also funded in part by Rothschild. The Great Synagogue, which became a major focus of life in Rishon LeZion, was built between 1885 and 1889. Under Rothschild's patronage, the [[Carmel-Mizrahi Winery]] was, established in 1886.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carmelwines.co.il/en/aboutus.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Carmel Wines |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623004346/http://www.carmelwines.co.il/en/aboutus.aspx |archive-date=23 June 2012}}</ref> The Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] and his wife [[Adelheid von Rothschild]] came to visit the village a year later in 1887.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

In 1886, as Rishon LeZion's population of around 300 included several dozen children who required proper education, the [[Haviv elementary school]] was established in Rishon LeZion as the first modern school to teach exclusively in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Dov Lubman Haviv taught there and Mordechai Lubman Haviv was an educational inspector. [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], the leading figure in the revival of Hebrew, was a teacher in Rishon LeZion, as was his colleague [[David Yudilovitz]]. In 1898, the first Hebrew kindergarten in the world was established by Esther (Shapira) Ginzburg a former student of the Haviv school.

[[Naphtali Herz Imber]], the later famed Hebrew language poet, lived in Rishon LeZion for a few years in the late 1880s. He recited his poem, Tikvahtenu, to eager ears. In 1887, [[Shmuel Cohen]], a young resident of Rishon with a musical background, observed the emotional response of the local Jewish farmers to Imber's poem. Using his musical skill, he put the poem to music. Cohen's musical composition was an adaptation of a Moldavian/Romanian folk song, "Carul cu Boi" ("The Cart with Oxen"). The catalyst of Cohen's musical adaptation facilitated the quick, enthusiastic spread of Imber's poem throughout all the Zionist communities of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Within a short few years, it spread globally to pro-Zionist communities and organizations becoming the unofficial Zionist National Anthem.

In 1933, at the 18th Zionist Congress in Prague, the Imber/Cohen Zionist National Anthem, formally adopted, was renamed the Hatikvah (The Hope). In November 2004, the State of Israel formally adopted [[Shmuel Cohen]]'s 1887 musical adaptation to a newly shortened, modified version of Imber's poem, creating the modern Israeli National Anthem, the [[Hatikvah]].

In 1888, the medicine house, the baron's stables, and the baron's clerks house were built. In 1889 the building in which the [[Carmel-Mizrahi Winery]] is located was built. A telephone was added to the winery in 1891 and in 1898 electricity was installed. In 1890, a palm boulevard was planted in the location of the future city park. The Rishon LeZion orchestra was established in 1895. In 1898, the year [[Theodor Herzl]] visited the settlement, the city park (then the village park) was established and a water tower was built next to the well.<ref name=muni/>

A founder of Rishon LeZion was Joseph Feinberg<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/eng/Pages/HistoryofRishonLeZion.aspx|title=History of Rishon LeZion|publisher=Rishon LeZion Municipality|access-date=5 March 2017|archive-date=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320162853/http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/eng/pages/historyofrishonlezion.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> the father of [[Murder of Dora Bloch|Dora Bloch]].

At the year of its founding in 1882, Rishon LeZion had a population of 150. In 1890, Rishon LeZion had a population of 359. Five years later, the figure had risen to 380, and by 1900, to 526.<ref>[https://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/TheCity/history/Lists/List1/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=19 1900]</ref>

===Village council and JCA administration (1900-1922)===
In 1900, the management of the village was transferred from the baron's office to the village council and the [[Jewish Colonization Association]]. Israel's first [[Prime Minister]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], worked in the winery for two months in the summer of 1907.<ref>[[Shabtai Teveth|Teveth, Shabtai]] (1987) ''Ben-Gurion. The Burning Ground. 1886-1948.'' Houghton Mifflin; {{ISBN|978-0-395-35409-4}}. p. 53</ref>

In 1910, the village bell was constructed next to the medicine house, and in 1912 the first car ("First chariot without horses") appeared in the village.<ref name=muni/> In 1911, 4,000 dunams of land in Rishon LeZion were planted with grapes and 254 dunams with other fruit orchards.<ref name=Calif>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdvgiXjvgLcC&q=rishon+lezion&pg=PA54|title=California Dreaming: Ideology, Society, and Technology in the Citrus|author=Karlinsky, Nahum|author2=Greenwood, Naftali|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|page=54|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7914-6527-1|access-date=5 April 2008|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529124151/https://books.google.com/books?id=cdvgiXjvgLcC&q=rishon+lezion&pg=PA54|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1913, the governor of Greater Syria, [[Djemal Pasha]], annexed the sands around Rishon Lezion to their territory and in 1915 Rishon Lezion was expanded again and was given the territory between it and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In 1913, Nahlat Yehuda, another Jewish settlement, was established north of Rishon Lezion. In 1915 Rishon Lezion and the surrounding area experienced a [[Locust]] attack.<ref name=muni/>

Ayun Kara was the scene of a bloody [[Battle of Ayun Kara|battle between Turkish and New Zealand troops]] on 14 November 1917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desert-column.phpbb3now.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=428|title=The Battle of Ayun Kara, Palestine, 14 November 1917|publisher=Desert-column.phpbb3now.com|access-date=24 September 2011|archive-date=14 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814125911/http://desert-column.phpbb3now.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=428|url-status=live}}</ref> Local citizens carried the wounded to a medical facility in Rishon LeZion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzmr.org/ayunkara.htm|title=Ayun Kara New Zealand Mounted Rifles|work=nzmr.org|date=2019-06-20|access-date=28 January 2011|archive-date=27 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727135922/http://www.nzmr.org/ayunkara.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> A stone [[cenotaph]] was erected by the people of Rishon LeZion to the memory of the New Zealanders who fell that day, but it has since been destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/war-memorial/online-cenotaph/record/C6564 |title=Hugh Gordon Haswell |via=Online Cenotaph |publisher=[[Auckland War Memorial Museum]] |access-date=9 July 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzmr.org/ayunkara.htm|title=Ayun Kara New Zealand Mounted Rifles|publisher=Nzmr.org|access-date=24 September 2011|archive-date=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922064736/http://www.nzmr.org/ayunkara.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the wake of the battle, the [[New Zealand]]ers set up camp at Rishon Lezion, which was described by one officer as a "pretty little hamlet surrounded by vineyards and orange groves." Relations between the troops and villagers were good, and the troops brought the villagers the news of the [[Balfour Declaration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.israel21c.org/what-do-new-zealand-and-rishon-lezion-have-in-common/|title=What do New Zealand and Rishon LeZion have in common?|last=Neiman|first=Rachel|website=Israel21c|language=en-US|access-date=29 March 2019|date=8 November 2017|archive-date=29 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329215335/https://www.israel21c.org/what-do-new-zealand-and-rishon-lezion-have-in-common/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1919, the women of Rishon Lezion were given [[Women's voting rights|voting rights]] and in the same year, Nehama Pohatchevsky was elected chairman of the village council which marked the first time a woman was elected to the position.<ref name=muni/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/odot/Pages/default.aspx|title=עיריית ראשון לציון - אודות העיר|website=Rishonlezion.muni.il|access-date=2 March 2019|archive-date=2 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202065714/http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/ODOT/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref>

===British Mandate===
In 1924, the British Army contracted the [[Israel Electric Corporation|Jaffa Electric Company]] for wired electric power to the military installations in [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]]. The contract allowed the Electric Company to extend the grid beyond the original geographical limits that had been projected by the concession it was given. The high-tension line that exceeded the limits of the original concession ran along some major towns and agricultural settlements, offering extended connections to the Jewish settlements of Rishon Le-Zion, [[Ness Ziona|Nes-Ziona]] and [[Rehovot]] (despite their proximity to the high-tension line, the Arab towns of [[Ramla|Ramleh]] and [[Lydda]] remained unconnected).<ref>{{cite book |last= Shamir |first= Ronen |title= Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine |pages= 71, 118 |publisher= Stanford University Press |date= 2013 |isbn= 978-0-8047-8706-2}}</ref> According to a [[1922 census of Palestine|census]] conducted in 1922 by the [[Mandate for Palestine|British Mandate authorities]], Rishon LeZion had a population of 1,396 inhabitants, consisting of 1,373 Jews and 23 Muslims,<ref name=Census22>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/PalestineCensus1922|title=Palestine Census (1922)|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> increasing in 1931 [[census]] to 2,525 inhabitants, in 648 houses.<ref name=Census31>Mills, 1932, p.

Rishon LeZion can be divided into four main quarters: the old city, the eastern housing projects, the northern (old) industrial zone, and Western Rishon LeZion. There is also an industrial zone on the southern tip of the city, next to [[Gan Sorek]].

===Old city===
The old city of Rishon includes the original neighborhoods, some buildings dating back to Rishon's founding in 1881. This quarter is located in the city center, between and around Herzl and Jabotinsky Streets. It includes the following neighborhoods:
Nahalat Yehuda (on the northernmost tip of Rishon); Neve Hillel; Bnot Hayil; Abramovich; Katzenelson; Remez (Giv'at Levinson), on the southwestern tip of old Rishon; Rishonim (Gan Nahum), to the east of Remez

===Shikunei HaMizrah===
The Eastern Housing Projects ({{langx|he|שיכוני המזרח}} ''Shikunei HaMizrah'') was Rishon's quick expansion to the east.

The eastern projects stopped developing when they reached the fences of the [[Tzrifin]] military base. When and if Tzrifin is sold to private contractors as planned, this quarter is expected to expand significantly with new lucrative housing projects. Other smaller neighborhoods include Revivim, Kidmat Rishon, Ne'urim, Rambam, Neve Hadarim, [[HaShomer]], Kfar Arye, Mishor HaNof and Kiryat Simha.

===West Rishon===
West Rishon LeZion is the conglomeration of the new neighborhoods of the city, built in the 1980s and 90s. The west also has a higher land value because of its relative proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It includes the entire city west of [[Highway 42 (Israel)|Tzahal Road]]. The quarter includes the new industrial zone (Western ''Mabat''), and several residential neighborhoods: Neve Eliyahu (or Ramat Eliyahu), Neot Shikma, Neve Dekalim, Neve Hof (or Pueblo Español), Neve Yam, Kiryat Rishon, Kiryat Cramim, Kiryat Ganim, Neot Ashalim, Kiryat Hatanei Pras Nobel (''lit'' Nobel Prize Laureates' Town)

According to [[Haaretz]], he felt he could not sit quietly at home while missiles were falling on his sister city. Throughout the war, he stayed at the home of Rishon LeZion mayor [[Meir Nitzan]] and accompanied him on visits to sites hit by missiles.<ref name=aretz>{{cite web|last=Gilad|first=Moshe|url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/choose-your-family-1.228972|title=Choose your family|publisher=Haaretz|date=September 6, 2007|access-date=February 4, 2014|archive-date=February 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227011046/http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/choose-your-family-1.228972|url-status=live}}</ref>
