'''Samarra''' ({{langx|ar|سَامَرَّاء}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Sāmarrāʾ}}'') is a city in [[Iraq]]. It stands on the east bank of the [[Tigris]] in the [[Saladin Governorate]], {{convert|125|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Baghdad]]. The modern city of Samarra was founded in 836 by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] as a new administrative capital and military base.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Northedge |first=Alastair E. |title=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Three |publisher=Brill |year=2012 |isbn=9789004161658 |editor-last=Fleet |editor-first=Kate |location= |pages= |chapter=ʿAbbāsid art and architecture |editor-last2=Krämer |editor-first2=Gudrun |editor-last3=Matringe |editor-first3=Denis |editor-last4=Nawas |editor-first4=John |editor-last5=Rowson |editor-first5=Everett}}</ref> In 2003 the city had an estimated population of 348,700.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} During the [[Iraqi civil war (2006–2008)|Iraqi Civil War]] (2006-08), Samarra was in the "[[Sunni Triangle]]" of resistance.

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2023}}{{main|Timeline of Samarra}}

===Prehistoric Samarra===
{{main|Samarra culture}}

The remains of [[prehistoric]] Samarra were first excavated between 1911 and 1914 by the German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]]. Samarra became the [[type site]] for the [[Samarra culture]]. Since 1946, the notebooks, letters, unpublished excavation reports and photographs have been in the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.

The civilization flourished alongside the [[Ubaid period]], as one of the first town states in the [[Near East]]. It lasted from 5,500 BCE and eventually collapsed in 3,900 BCE.

=== Neo-Assyrian period ===
A city of '''Sur-marrati''' (refounded by [[Sennacherib]] in 690 BC according to a [[stele]] in the [[Walters Art Museum]]) is insecurely identified with a fortified [[Assyria]]n site at al-Huwaysh on the Tigris opposite modern Samarra. The State Archives of Assyria Online identifies ''Surimarrat'' as the modern site of Samarra.<ref>[http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/cbd/qpn/qpn.x030705.html SAAO]</ref>

Ancient place names for Samarra noted by the Samarra Archaeological Survey are Greek ''Souma'' ([[Ptolemy]] V.19, [[Zosimus (historian)|Zosimus]] III, 30), Latin ''Sumere'', a fort mentioned during the [[Battle of Samarra|retreat of the army of Julian]] in 363 AD ([[Ammianus Marcellinus]] XXV, 6, 4), and Syriac ''Sumra'' (Hoffmann, ''Auszüge'', 188; [[Michael the Syrian]], III, 88), described as a village.

The possibility of a larger population was offered by the opening of the Qatul al-Kisrawi, the northern extension of the [[Nahrawan Canal]] which drew water from the [[Tigris]] in the region of Samarra, attributed by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (''Muʿjam'', see under "Qatul") to [[Khosrau I]] (531–578). To celebrate the completion of this  project, a commemorative tower (modern Burj al-Qa'im) was built at the southern inlet south of Samarra, and a palace with a "paradise" or walled hunting park was constructed at the northern inlet (modern Nahr ar-Rasasi) near [[ad-Dawr]].  A supplementary canal, the Qatul Abi al-Jund, excavated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], was commemorated by a planned city laid out in the form of a regular octagon (modern Husn al-Qadisiyya), called al-Mubarak and abandoned unfinished in 796.

In 836 [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mu'tasim]] founded a new capital at the banks of the Tigris. Here he built extensive palace complexes surrounded by garrison settlements for his guards, mostly drawn from [[Central Asia]] and [[Iran]] (most famously the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], as well as the Khurasani ''[[Ishtakhaniyya]]'', ''[[Faraghina]]'' and ''[[Ushrusaniyya]]'' regiments) or North Africa (like the ''[[Maghariba (Abbasid troops)|Maghariba]]''). Although quite often called [[Mamluk]] slave soldiers, their status was quite elevated; some of their commanders bore Sogdian titles of nobility.<ref name="Babaie">{{cite book | title=Slaves of the Shah | url=https://archive.org/details/slavesshahneweli00baba | url-access=limited | publisher=I.B.Tauris & Co Ltd | author=Babaie, Sussan | year=2004 | location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/slavesshahneweli00baba/page/n18 4]–5 | isbn=1-86064-721-9}}</ref>

The city was further developed under Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]], who sponsored the construction of lavish palace complexes, such as al-Mutawakkiliyya, and the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] with its famous spiral [[minaret]] or Malwiya, built in 847. For his son [[al-Mu'tazz]] he built the large palace Bulkuwara.

[[File:قصر العاشق مدينه سامراء.jpg|thumb|[[Qasr al-'Ashiq]], an Abbasid-era palace near Samarra]]
The Nestorian patriarch [[Sargis (Nestorian Patriarch)|Sargis]] (860–72) moved the patriarchal seat of the [[Church of the East]] from Baghdad to Samarra, and one or two of his immediate successors may also have sat in Samarra so as to be close to the seat of power.<ref>Mari, 80–1 (Arabic), 71–2 (Latin)</ref>

Samarra remained the residence of the caliph until 892, when [[al-Mu'tadid]] returned the capital to Baghdad.<ref name=":1" /> Historical sources report that the city was looted around this time. Its population probably decreased and the city declined, but it remained an important market center.<ref name=":1">{{EI2|volume=8|article=Sāmarrā'|last=Northedge|first=Alastair|pages=1039–1041}}</ref> 

From the tenth century onward it turned into an important pilgrimage site. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the river's course to the south of the city shifted further east. As a result, the main road between Baghdad and Mosul was moved to the west bank and Samarra lost its importance as a trading town.<ref name=":1" />

===Modern era===
In the eighteenth century, one of the most violent battles of the 1730–1735 [[Ottoman–Persian War (1730–35)|Ottoman–Persian War]], the [[Battle of Samarra (1733)|Battle of Samarra]], took place, where over 50,000 Turks and Persians became casualties. The engagement decided the fate of [[Ottoman Iraq]] and kept it under Istanbul's suzerainty until the [[First World War]].

During the 1950s, Samarra gained new importance when a permanent lake, [[Lake Tharthar]], was created through the construction of the [[Samarra Barrage]], which was built in order to prevent the frequent flooding of Baghdad. Many local people were displaced by the dam, resulting in an increase in Samarra's population.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hann |first1=Geoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9RNCgAAQBAJ&dq=samarra+barrage+displacement+population&pg=PA188 |title=Iraq: The ancient sites and Iraqi Kurdistan |last2=Dabrowska |first2=Karen |last3=Townsend-Greaves |first3=Tina |date=2015-08-07 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |isbn=978-1-84162-488-4 |language=en}}</ref><!-- Because this information was already present on this Wikipedia article prior to this travel guide's publication, there is a chance that this could be a circular reference.

On February 22, 2006, the golden dome of the [[al-Askari Mosque]] was [[2006 al-Askari Shrine bombing|bombed]] by [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]], setting off a period of rioting and reprisal attacks across the country which claimed hundreds of lives.

Ever since the end of Iraqi civil war in 2007, the Shia population of the holy city has increased exponentially. However, violence has continued, with bombings taking place in [[2011 Samarra bombing|2011]] and [[20 September Samarra attack|2013]]. In June 2014, the city was attacked by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) as part of the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|Northern Iraq offensive]].

The metaphor of "Having an appointment in Samarra", signifying death, is a literary reference to an ancient Babylonian myth recorded in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and transcribed by [[W. Somerset Maugham]],<ref>"The Appointment in Samarra" (as retold by W. Somerset Maugham [1933]).</ref> in which Death narrates a man's futile attempt to escape him by fleeing from Baghdad to Samarra.  The story "The Appointment in Samarra" subsequently formed the germ of a [[Appointment in Samarra|novel of the same name]] by [[John O'Hara]].<ref>John O'Hara, ''Appointment in Samarra'', Harcourt, Brace & Co.</ref> The original story was retold in verse by [[F. L. Lucas]] in his poem "The Destined Hour" in ''[[From Many Times and Lands]]'' (1953).<ref>Lucas, F. L., "The Destined Hour" in ''From Many Times and Lands'' (London, 1953), p.119; reprinted in ''Every Poem Tells a Story: A Collection of Stories in Verse'', ed.

L., 'The Destined Hour' (online text), www.funtrivia.com]</ref> 

In the 1968 film ''[[Targets]]'', Byron Orlok, an aging horror film star played by [[Boris Karloff]], tells Maugham's version of the story to his younger colleagues.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Bogdanovich, Peter (director) | date=1968 | title=Targets | type=DVD | location=United States of America | publisher=Criterion}}</ref>

The story is told in "[[The Six Thatchers]]", a 2017 episode of ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]''.
