Maracaibo is nicknamed "The Beloved Land of the Sun" ({{langx|es|La Tierra del Sol Amada}}).

Maracaibo is considered the economic center of western Venezuela, owing to the petroleum industry that developed in the shores of [[Lake Maracaibo]]. It is sometimes known as "The First City of Venezuela", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located in the shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/venezuela/history.htm|title=Venezuela - An Introduction|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>

Early indigenous settlements around the area were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Maracaibo's founding date is disputed. There were failed attempts to found the city—in 1529, by Captain [[Ambrosius Ehinger|Ambrosio Ehinger]], and in 1569, by Captain Alonso Pacheco. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain Pedro Maldonado, the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo|title=Maracaibo {{!}} Venezuela|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.

Maracaibo is served by [[La Chinita International Airport]]. The [[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] connects Maracaibo to the rest of the country.

== Etymology ==
{{Unsourced|section|date=June 2023}}
The name Maracaibo is said to derive from the brave ''[[cacique]]'' (indigenous chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. 

Legend says that when Mara fell, the Coquivacoa shouted "''Mara cayó!''" ("''Mara fell!''"), thus originating the city name — although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was "Maara-iwo" meaning "Place where serpents abound".

== History ==
{{Moresources|section|date=June 2023}}
[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of New Zamora of Maracaibo.svg|thumb|left|upright|First version of coat of arms with royal elements, according to ''Discrezión de la laguna de la ciudad de Maracaibo'' in [[General Archive of the Indies]].]]

===Foundation===
The first indigenous settlements were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Around the main group were the [[Paraujano language|Añu]] tribe who built rows of [[stilt house]]s all over the northern riviera of Lake Maracaibo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/maracaibo.htm|title=Error|author=Irama Iglesias|work=efemeridevenezolana}}</ref> The first Europeans arrived in 1499.

The city was founded three times: the first time was during the [[Klein-Venedig]] period (1528&ndash;1546), when the [[Welser]] bankers of [[Augsburg]] received a concession over [[Venezuela Province]] from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. In August 1529, the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous [[Coquivacoa]]. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg ({{langx|de|Neu-Nürnberg}}) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.<ref>[http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html Das Imperium der Welser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422023929/http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref> The lack of activity in the zone made [[Nikolaus Federmann]] evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to [[Santa Marta]] near the then capital of [[Venezuela Province]], [[Santa Ana de Coro]].

A second attempt by Captain Alonso Pacheco in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor [[Diego de Mazariegos]]'s command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. "Nueva Zamora" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of [[Lake Maracaibo]], the dominant feature of the oil-rich [[Maracaibo Basin]]. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], first become pronounced.

===Pirate attacks===
[[File:Castillo San Carlos de la Barra 12.jpg|thumb|left|San Carlos de la Barra Castle, Spanish fort guarding the entry to Lake Maracaibo]]
The Dutch corsair [[Henrik de Gerard]] plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate [[William Jackson (pirate)|William Jackson]]. In 1667, [[l'Olonnais]] with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gemstone]]s and more than 260,000 [[pieces of eight]].

In March 1669, [[Henry Morgan]] [[Henry Morgan's raid on Lake Maracaibo|sacked Maracaibo]], which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the ''Magdalena'', the ''San Luis'', and the ''Soledad''. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the ''Soledad'' surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.<ref>''Harry Morgan's Way'', (AlisonPress, 1977), Dudley Pope, {{ISBN|978-1842324820}}</ref><ref>''Caribbean'', James A.Michener, Guild Publishing, 1989, ASIN: B00EFKMICY</ref>

In June 1678, [[Michel de Grammont]], the French commander of six ships and 700 men, captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], penetrating as far inland as [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].

=== Venezuelan Independence ===
[[File:Batalla del Lago de Maracaibo 1823.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of the Battle of Lake Maracaibo]]
In 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] and remained loyal to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. Maracaibo then held the seat of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].

In 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], led by [[Francisco Tomás Morales]], fought with the patriots, led by [[Rafael Urdaneta]], to take back control over the province in the Juana de Ávila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated in the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.

=== Isolation period ===
For about 380 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation to the area was possible through the lake via boats and ferries. Commerce and culture flowed between Maracaibo and the Caribbean Sea, particularly the Dutch Antilles, Colombian coastal cities, Cuba, Hispaniola and later on Miami, New York and Hamburg.

This isolation from the rest of Venezuela was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called {{lang|es|La República Independiente del Zulia}}, 'the Independent Republic of Zulia', but this has never come to be.

Come the 20th century, cars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product to and from the city port, depended on ferry services between the city and the eastern shore which was poorly connected to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to [[Colombia]] and the Caribbean than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.

In January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente [[Cipriano Castro]], the German warship [[SMS Panther|SMS ''Panther'']] attempted to enter [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the [[SMS Vineta|SMS ''Vineta'']], with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the ''Vineta'' bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.

In 1908, the ''Friesland'', ''[[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|Gelderland]]'' and ''[[HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck (1906)|Jacob van Heemskerck]]''
were sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the [[Cipriano Castro|second Castro crisis]]. ''Friesland'' guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.<ref name="scheepvaartmuseum.nl :: Maritieme kalender 1908">{{cite web |url=http://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/knowledgebase/calendar%7C1908 |publisher=Hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl |title=Maritieme kalender 1908 |access-date=2013-07-01 |archive-date=2017-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109191410/https://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/knowledgebase/calendar%7c1908 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Building of the bridge ===
[[File:Rafael Urdaneta Bridge in Maracaibo.jpg|thumb|right|Maracaibo Lake Bridge]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
The dictatorial regime of General [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]] in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this "city of independent thought" should be more "connected" to the rest of the country.

Proposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the Pérez Jiménez regime on January 23, 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more financially responsible government.

The building of {{lang|es|El Puente sobre el Lago de Maracaibo "General Rafael Urdaneta"}} ('[[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] over Lake Maracaibo') named after the distinguished general and war of independence [[Rafael Urdaneta|hero]] was opened to public traffic in 1962 connecting the city to its opposite shore neighbors and the rest of the country through a new system of highways. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.

This bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.

=== Modern times ===
[[File:Teatro Baralt I.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior of Baralt Theatre]]
[[François de Pons]], an agent to the French government in Caracas, provides some historical insight into the people of Maracaibo in his travel journal {{Harv|de Pons|1806}}. The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:

:"They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo {{sic}} are covered."

He also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:

:"But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters."

Maracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: the municipality of Maracaibo proper, and the [[San Francisco Municipality, Zulia|municipality of San Francisco]], established in 1995, to the south. In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including [[Caracas]]).

Maracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university, ''[[University of Zulia|La Universidad del Zulia]]'' (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines. Other universities and schools include [[Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chacín]] (URBE) and [[Universidad Rafael Urdaneta]], with one of the country's leading psychology schools. However, recent political instability has led to the decline of the universidad.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Otis |first=John |date=2023-10-31 |title=Why one family is joining a historic wave of Venezuelans migrating to the U.S. |url=https://www.npr.org/2023/10/31/1207963084/venezuela-migrants-to-us |work=National Public Radio}}</ref>

===Climate===
Maracaibo is one of the hottest cities in [[Venezuela]] and all of [[South America]] as well. The [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] gives the city a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''BSh'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://es.meteocast.in/forecast/ve/maracaibo/|title=Pronóstico del tiempo para Maracaibo - precisa y detallada previsión del tiempo en Maracaibo para el día de hoy, de mañana y de la semana. Maracaibo, Estado Zulia, Venezuela }}</ref>
Attenuated only by the moderating influence of the lake; Maracaibo's average historical temperature is {{convert|29|C|F|1}}. In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity. Today, control of plagues and the effects of urban development has largely eradicated these health problems. The registered high temperature of the city is {{convert|43.6|C|F|1}}, and the lowest is {{convert|18.8|C|F|1}}.

[[File:JPPachenchoRomero-16.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio José Pachencho Romero]]]]
Due to the regionalistic nature of Marabinos, they strongly support their native teams. Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in [[baseball]] by the [[Águilas del Zulia]], a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the [[Liga Venezolana de Béisbol Profesional]], and is based in the [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]].

== Culture ==
[[File:Monumento a la Chinita I.JPG|thumb|left|Monument of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá]]
Culture in Maracaibo maintains strong Indigenous influences, from its [[Gaita (music style)|gaitas]], desserts, style, and other customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how different the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], while in Maracaibo it is [[Pepsi]]. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to [[Joan Corominas]], it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for "goat", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the "furro" instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del Éxito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.
