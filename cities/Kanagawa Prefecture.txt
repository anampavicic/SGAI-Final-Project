Kanagawa Prefecture is part of the [[Greater Tokyo Area]], the most populous [[metropolitan area]] in the world, with Yokohama and many of its cities being major commercial hubs and southern [[suburb]]s of Tokyo. Kanagawa Prefecture was the political and economic center of Japan during the [[Kamakura period]] when [[Kamakura]] was the [[de facto]] capital and largest city of Japan as the seat of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] from 1185 to 1333. Kanagawa Prefecture is a popular tourist area in the Tokyo region, with Kamakura and [[Hakone, Kanagawa|Hakone]] being two popular side trip destinations.

==History==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Kanagawa Prefecture}}

The prefecture has some archaeological sites going back to the [[Jōmon period]] (around 400 BCE). About 3,000 years ago, [[Mount Hakone]] produced a volcanic explosion which resulted in [[Lake Ashi]] on the western area of the prefecture.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

It is believed{{By whom|date=April 2011}} that the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial dynasty]] ruled this area from the 5th century onwards. In the [[ancient era]], its plains were very sparsely inhabited.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In medieval Japan, Kanagawa was part of the provinces of [[Sagami Province|Sagami]] and [[Musashi Province|Musashi]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 466|page=466}}.</ref> [[Kamakura]] in central Sagami was the capital of Japan during the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333).

During the [[Edo period]], the western part of Sagami Province was governed by the ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Odawara Castle]], while the eastern part was directly governed by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

[[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] landed in Kanagawa in 1853 and 1854 and signed the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] to force open Japanese ports to the United States. [[Yokohama]], the largest deep-water port in [[Tokyo Bay]], was opened to foreign traders in 1859 after several more years of foreign pressure, and eventually developed into the largest trading port in Japan. Nearby [[Yokosuka]], closer to the mouth of Tokyo Bay, developed as a naval port and now serves as headquarters for the [[U.S. 7th Fleet]] and the fleet operations of the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]. After the [[Meiji period]], many foreigners lived in Yokohama City, and visited [[Hakone]]. The [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] developed the first railways in Japan, from [[Shinbashi]] (in Tokyo) to Yokohama in 1872.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The epicenter of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] was deep beneath [[Izu Ōshima]] Island in Sagami Bay. It devastated Tokyo, the port city of [[Yokohama]], surrounding prefectures of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Kanagawa]], and [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]], and caused widespread damage throughout the [[Kantō region]].<ref>Hammer, Joshua. (2006). {{Google books|6O8VyhDbUPgC|''Yokohama Burning: the Deadly 1923 Earthquake and Fire that Helped Forge the Path to World War II'', p. 278|page=278}}.</ref> The sea receded as much as 400 metres from the shore at [[Manazuru, Kanagawa|Manazuru Point]], and then rushed back towards the shore in a great wall of water which swamped Mitsuishi-shima.<ref>Hammer, {{Google books|6O8VyhDbUPgC|pp. 114–115|page=114}}.</ref> At [[Kamakura]], the total death toll from earthquake, tsunami, and fire exceeded 2,000 victims.<ref>Hammer, {{Google books|6O8VyhDbUPgC|pp. 115-116|page=115}}.</ref> At [[Odawara]], ninety percent of the buildings collapsed immediately, and subsequent fires burned the rubble along with anything else left standing.<ref>Hammer, {{Google books|6O8VyhDbUPgC|p. 113|page=113}}.</ref>

Yokohama, [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], and other major cities were heavily damaged by the U.S. bombing in 1945. Total casualties amounted to more than several thousand. After the war, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] for the [[Occupation of Japan]], landed in Kanagawa, before moving to other areas. U.S. military bases still remain in Kanagawa, including [[Camp Zama]] ([[United States Army|Army]]), [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]], [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]] ([[United States Navy|Navy]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://cnrj.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NAF-Atsugi/ | title=Naval Air Facility Atsugi }}</ref>

In 1945, Kanagawa was the 15th most populous prefecture in Japan, with the population of about 1.9 million. In the years after the war, the prefecture underwent rapid urbanization as a part of the Greater Tokyo Area. The population {{As of|2014|September|1|df=US|lc=y}} is estimated to be 9.1 million.<ref>{{cite report|title=神奈川県人口統計調査公表資料|date=2014|url=http://www.pref.kanagawa.jp/cnt/f6774/p520876.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013040640/http://www.pref.kanagawa.jp/cnt/f6774/p520876.html|archive-date=2014-10-13}}</ref> Kanagawa became the second most populous prefecture in 2006. <!--from Japanese Wikipedia Data-->

Kanagawa is a relatively small prefecture located at the southeastern corner of the [[Kantō Plain]]<ref name="jiban.co.jp">{{webtrans|http://www.jiban.co.jp/jibankaisetu/todohuken/kanagawa/jiban_kanagawa.htm|Kanagawa terrain|ja}}</ref> wedged between Tokyo on the north, the foothills of [[Mount Fuji]] on the northwest, and the [[Sagami Bay]]<ref name="jiban.co.jp"/> and [[Tokyo Bay]] on the south and east. The eastern side of the prefecture is relatively flat and heavily urbanized, including the large port cities of [[Yokohama]] and [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]].

The southeastern area nearby the [[Miura Peninsula]] is less urbanized, with the ancient city of [[Kamakura]] drawing tourists to temples and shrines. The western part, bordered by [[Yamanashi Prefecture]] and [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] on the west,<ref name="pref.kanagawa.jp">{{webtrans|//web.archive.org/web/20081030195757/http://www.pref.kanagawa.jp/osirase/kankyokeikaku/heatisland/H17HeatIsland2-1.pdf|Overview of the prefectural geography|ja}}</ref> is more mountainous and includes resort areas like [[Odawara]] and [[Hakone]]. The area, stretching {{convert|80|km|mi}} from west to east and {{convert|60|km|mi}} from north to south, contains {{convert|2400|sqkm|sqmi}} of land, accounting for 0.64% of the total land area of Japan.<ref name="pref.kanagawa.jp"/>

{{As of|2012|4|1}}, 23% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]; Tanzawa-Ōyama Quasi-National Park; and [[Jinba Sagamiko Prefectural Natural Park|Jinba Sagamiko]], [[Manazuru Hantō Prefectural Natural Park|Manazuru Hantō]], [[Okuyugawara Prefectural Natural Park|Okuyugawara]], and [[Tanzawa-Ōyama Prefectural Natural Park|Tanzawa-Ōyama]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |access-date=16 August 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421180819/http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |archive-date=21 April 2012 }}</ref>

===Topography===
Topographically, the prefecture consists of three distinct areas. The mountainous western region features the [[Tanzawa Mountains|Tanzawa Mountain Range]] and the volcano [[Mount Hakone]]. The hilly eastern region is characterized by the [[Tama Hills]] and [[Miura Peninsula]]. The central region, which surrounds the Tama Hills and Miura Peninsula, consists of flat stream terraces and low lands around major rivers including the [[Sagami River]], [[Sakai River (Tokyo, Kanagawa)|Sakai River]], [[Tsurumi River]], and [[Tama River]].<ref name="pref.kanagawa.jp"/>

The [[Tama River]] forms much of the boundary between Kanagawa and Tokyo. The [[Sagami River]] flows through the middle of the prefecture. In the western region, the Sakawa runs through a small lowland, the Sakawa Lowland, between Mount Hakone to the west and the Ōiso Hills to the east, and flows into Sagami Bay.<ref name="jiban.co.jp"/>

The Tanzawa Mountain Range, part of the Kantō Mountain Range, contains [[Mount Hiru]] ({{convert|1673|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the highest peak in the prefecture. Other mountains measure similar mid-range heights: Mount Hinokiboramaru ({{convert|1601|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Mount Tanzawa]], ({{convert|1567|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Mount Ōmuro (Tanzawa)|Mount Ōmuro]] ({{convert|1588|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Mount Himetsugi ({{convert|1433|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and [[Mount Usu]] ({{convert|1460|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The mountain range is lower in height southward leading to Hadano Basin to the Ōiso Hills. At the eastern foothills of the mountain range lies the Isehara Plateau and across the Sagami River the [[Sagamino plateau]].<ref name="jiban.co.jp"/>
