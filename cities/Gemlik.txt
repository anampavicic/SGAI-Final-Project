It is approximately {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Bursa]]. In antiquity, Gemlik was the location of the ancient Greek town of [[Cius]].

Gemlik is an industrial port and has a [[Free economic zone|freezone]] trade center. There are also important industrial establishments in the south and west of the harbors. The port of Gemlik is one of the busiest import harbors in Turkey. Gemlik is renowned for [[Gemlik olive|black olives]].

==Etymology==

In the [[Ottoman era]], the town began to be called '''Gemilik''' (Eng. shipyard), because of a [[shipyard]] in the town that built [[Galleon]]s for the [[Ottoman Navy]].

As of 1920, the British were calling Gemlik, '''Geumlek''' in publications.<ref name="Prothero75">{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/75/}}</ref>

==History==
===Ancient history===
Gemlik was the site of the ancient Greek city of Cius<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grant|first=Michael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spZO4-CA7V0C&q=Gemlik+Cius+history&pg=PA107|title=The Routledge Atlas of Classical History|date=1994|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-11935-1|language=en}}</ref> ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈsaɪəs/]]; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Kίος or Κῖος ''Kios''), later renamed '''Prusias on the Sea''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈpruːʒəs/]]; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Prusias ad Mare'') after king [[Prusias I of Bithynia]], was an [[ancient Greek]] city bordering the Propontis (now known as the [[Sea of Marmara]]), in [[Ancient Bithynia|Bithynia]] and formerly in [[Ancient Mysia|Mysia]] (in modern northwestern Turkey), and had a long history, being mentioned by [[Herodotus]], [[Xenophon]], [[Aristotle]], [[Strabo]] and [[Apollonius Rhodius]]. It was strategically placed at the head of a gulf in the Propontis, called the gulf of Cius, or ''Cianus Sinus''. Herodotus calls it '''Cius of Mysia'''; and also [[Xenophon]], from which it appears that Mysia, even in Xenophon's time, extended at least as far east as the head of the gulf of Cius. [[Pliny the Elder]] reports that Cius was a [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] colony. It was at the foot of [[Mount Arganthonius]], and there was a myth that [[Hylas]], one of the companions of [[Heracles]] on the voyage to [[Colchis]], was carried off by the nymphs when he went to get water here; and also that Cius, another companion of Heracles, on his return from Colchis, stayed here and founded the city, to which he gave his name. Pliny mentions a river Hylas and a river Cius here, one of which reminds us of the name of the youth who was stolen by the nymphs, and the other of the mythical founder. The Cius may be the channel by which the lake Ascania discharges its waters into the gulf of Cius; though Pliny speaks of the ''Ascanium flumen'' as flowing into the gulf, and we must assume that he gives this name to the channel which connects the lake and the sea. If the river Cius is not identical with this channel, it must be a small stream near Cius. As [[Ptolemy]] speaks of the outlets of the Ascanius, it has been conjectured that there may have been two, and that they may be the Hylas and Cius of Pliny; but the plural ἐκβολαί does not necessarily mean more than a single mouth; and Pliny certainly says that the Ascanius flows into the gulf. However, his geography is a constant cause of difficulty. The position of Cius made it the port for the inland parts, and it became a place of much commercial importance. [[Pomponius Mela]] calls it the most convenient emporium of [[Ancient Phrygia|Phrygia]], which was at no great distance from it.

Cius was taken by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]], after the burning of [[Sardis]], in 499 BCE. It joined the [[Aetolian League]], and was destroyed by [[Philip V of Macedon]] in the [[Second Macedonian War]] (200–197 BCE), and given by him to [[Prusias I of Bithynia]]. Prusias, who had assisted Philip in ruining Cius, restored it under the name of '''Prusias''' (Προυσιάς). It was sometimes called Prusias ἐπιθαλασσίη, or "on the sea," to distinguish it from other towns of the same name, or πρὸς θάλασσαν. In the text of [[Memnon of Heraclea|Memnon]] the reading is ''Cierus''; but Memnon, both in this and other passages, has confounded Cius and [[Cierus]]. But it is remarked that Cius must either have still existed by the side of the new city, or must have recovered its old name; for Pliny mentions Cius, and also Mela, [[Zosimus (historian)|Zosimus]], and writers of a still later date. It was an important chain in the ancient [[Silk Road]] and became known as a wealthy town.

There are coins of Cius, with the legend Κιανων, belonging to the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]]; and there are coins of Prusias with the epigraph, Προυσιεων των προς θαλασσαν.

Cius became an early Christian [[bishopric]]. Its bishop, Cyrillus, took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, and Theosebius attended the [[Council of Ephesus]]. The names of many of his successors in the first millennium are known from extant contemporary documents. At first a [[suffragan]] of [[Nicomedia]], it soon became an autocephalous [[archdiocese]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]], being listed as such in ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' from the 7th century onward. No longer a residential bishopric, Cius is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|d3c52|Cius (Titular See)|4 June 2024}}</ref> The town was lost to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1333.<ref>{{cite book |last1=GÜNDOĞDU |first1=Raşit |title=The Sultans of the Ottoman Empire |date=11 March 2020 |publisher=Rumuz Yayınları |isbn=9786055112158 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vDVDwAAQBAJ |access-date=26 June 2023}}</ref>

===Modern history===
From 1867 until 1922, Gemlik was part of [[Hüdavendigâr vilayet]]. In 1891, 5147 people lived in the town center including; 4620 Greeks, 242 Turks, 178 foreigner and 107 Armenian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gemlik.gov.tr/tarihce|title=Tarihçe|website=gemlik.gov.tr|access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> As of 1920, Gemlik was estimated to have a population of 5,000 (. At that time, it had a [[Shipyard|naval yard]] that was no longer in use.<ref name="Prothero75" /> On 11 September 1922, Gemlik's remaining Greek citizens left Gemlik to Greece due to [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange between Turkey and Greece]].

==Geography==
Gemlik was built on a plain which is bordered on three sides by mountains, with the [[Samanli Mountains]] lying from southeast to the northwest. There is a large plain spanning much of the east end of Gemlik to the coast. Karsak Stream, which originates at [[Lake Iznik]], divides this plain and town center into two parts.

The [[Gulf of Gemlik]], often called fig port of Kilyos (in reference to the ancient name of the town), is 35&nbsp;km from east to west, 10–15&nbsp;km from north to south, and 100–150 meters deep. For many years, this gulf had been used for docking ships, but now it serves as a tourist attraction.

The largest river in the area is Karsak, gurgles from İznik Lake and spilles to Gulf of Gemlik.

In rural areas of Gemlik District mostly covered by [[Olive|olive]] trees and [[Pine|pine]]s on the Samanlı Mountains.
