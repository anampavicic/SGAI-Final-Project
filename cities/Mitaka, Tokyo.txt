==History==
The area of present-day Mitaka was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]]. In the post-[[Meiji Restoration]] cadastral reform of 22 July 1878, the area became part of [[Kitatama District, Tokyo|Kitatama District]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. The village of Mitaka was created on 1 April 1889 with the establishment of modern municipalities law. Kitatama District was transferred to the administrative control of Tokyo Metropolis on 1 April 1893. Mitaka was raised to town status in 1940. In 1949, the [[Mitaka incident]], one of a series of unexplained fatal train accidents around the same period of time, occurred at [[Mitaka Station]].<ref name="TBM">[https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2018/05/the-three-big-rail-mysteries-that-defined-japans-summer-of-1949/ The Three Big Rail Mysteries that Defined Japan’s Summer of 1949]</ref> Mitaka City was officially founded on 3 November 1950. A motion to merge with neighboring Musashino City failed in 1955 by only a single vote in the Mitaka city assembly.

==Government==
Mitaka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Mitaka contributes two members to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Tokyo 22nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
