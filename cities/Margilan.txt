'''Margilan''' ({{langx|uz|Marg‘ilon/Марғилон}}, {{IPA-uz|marʁɨlɒn|pron}}; {{langx|ru|Маргилан}}) is a city (2022 pop. 242,500) in eastern [[Uzbekistan]]'s [[Fergana Region]].

Margilan is located in the south of the [[Fergana Valley]], where trade caravans from China traveled westwards and vice versa during the days of the [[Silk Road]]. Margilan has been renowned for its silk goods as far back as the 10th century.[https://samarkandtours.com/uzbekistan/margilan]<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Margilan, Uzbekistan|url=https://samarkandtours.com/uzbekistan/margilan|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 3, 2021|website=}}</ref>

According to legend, Margilan was founded by [[Alexander the Great]]. While stopping for lunch there, he was given chicken (''murgh''; in {{langx|fa|مرغ}}) and bread (''nan''; in Persian: {{lang|fa|نان}}), from which the town took its name. More reliable records indicate that by the 9th century Margilan was an important stop on the Silk Road, along the route going across the [[Alay Mountains]] to [[Kashgar]].

In the early 16th century [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dynasty, mentioned that "the [[pomegranate]]s and apricots are superb .... the game in Margilan is good; white deer may be found nearby. The people are [[Sart]]s. They are a feisty people, ready with their fists. The custom of [[exorcism]] is widespread throughout [[Transoxiana]], and most of the renowned exorcists of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]] are Margilanis. The author of the ''[[Hidaya]]'' ([[Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani]]) was from a Margilan village called [[Rishdan|Rishtan]]".<ref>''The Babur-nama'' Trans. & Ed. Wheeler M. Thackston (New York) 2002 p5</ref> This reputation for toughness extends to modern times. Margilan merchants were key players in Central Asian commerce, and were said to be a law unto themselves during [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] days, when the city was the heart of Uzbekistan's [[black market]].{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} Margilan today is also a stronghold of conservative [[Islam]], as is much of the Fergana Valley.

== History ==

=== In antiquity ===
There is a legend about the origin of the name of the city, associated with the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]]. Local residents, having learned of Alexander's intention to visit their city, prepared a red carpet for him. One of the elders of the town offered to welcome the guest with chicken and bread. After the feast, Alexander the Great asked what the dish was called. He was answered: "Murjinon", which means "chicken and bread". On his way back, he tasted the dish again and then called the place "Murjinon". Since then, the city has been named Margilan.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-02-13 |title=Маргилан расположен на юге Ферганы - Samarkand Tours Operator |url=https://samarkandtours.com/ru/uzbekistan/margilan/ |access-date=2023-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213030001/https://samarkandtours.com/ru/uzbekistan/margilan/ |archive-date=2021-02-13 }}</ref>

Margilan is one of the ancient cities of the [[Fergana Valley]]. In 1994-2004, employees of the Institute of Archaeology of [[Uzbekistan]] worked in the city, which revealed the existence of irrigated agriculture in Margilan oasis since no later than IV-III centuries BC.

The settlement appeared in the II-I centuries BC, when one of the roads of [[Silk Road]] passed through [[Fergana]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-01-10 |title=Маргилан :: Институт географии РАН |url=http://www.igras.ru/index.php?r=152&id=8371 |access-date=2023-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110175034/http://www.igras.ru/index.php?r=152&id=8371 |archive-date=2014-01-10 }}</ref> In the sources the settlement is known from the 9th century. The name Margilan has been known since the 10th century.

It is reliably known that Alexander the Great was not in Fergana, and the extreme point of his expansion in [[Central Asia]] was the city of [[Khujand]]. Near or on its place he erected the fortress-city of [[Alexandria Eschate]].

During [[World War II]], in 1942, the 9th Infantry Division of the Polish [[Anders' Army]] was stationed and organized in Margilan, before it was evacuated from Uzbekistan to fight against [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=ez>{{cite magazine|last=Ziółkowska|first=Ewa|year=2002|title=Polskie groby w Uzbekistanie i Kazachstanie.
