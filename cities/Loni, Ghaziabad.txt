==Name==
The name ''Lonī'' is from the Hindi word ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/लोन#Hindi lon]'', meaning "salt", which ultimately comes from Sanskrit ''lavaṇa''. The name probably refers to the town's location in the middle of an area with abundant salt.<ref name="Whalley 1926">{{cite journal |last1=Whalley |first1=Paul |title=Place-Names in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, Chapter III, Part 1 |journal=The Journal of the United Provinces Historical Society |date=1926 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=1–60 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwdDAAAAYAAJ |access-date=22 July 2023}}</ref>{{rp|43}}

==History==
{{POV section|date=September 2021}}

Loni is listed in the [[Ain-i-Akbari]], a Mughal period document, as a [[pargana]] under the Delhi [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] subdivision, producing a revenue of 3,278,878 [[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]s for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 200 infantry and 20 cavalry. It had a brick fort at the time.<ref name="Ain-i-Akbari">{{cite book |author=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |author-link=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |translator-last=Jarrett |translator-first=Henry Sullivan |title=The Ain-i-Akbari |url=https://archive.org/details/ainiakbarivolum00mubgoog |date=1891 |location=Calcutta |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |page=288 |access-date=11 March 2022}}</ref>

In the 14th century, an invasion by Timur took place in the town and fort of Loni a few days before the battle against Delhi's Tughlaq Sultan [[Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq|Mahmud Shah]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=René |url=http://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou |title=The empire of the steppes; a history of central Asia |date=1970 |publisher=New Brunswick, N.J., Rutgers University Press |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-8135-0627-2 |pages=444–445 |language=en, fr}}</ref> One of Timur's emirs expressed the fear that the men, women and children they were dragging with them would break free and attack from the rear while the army was occupied in battle. Timur's solution was to have a hundred thousand adult Hindu males slaughtered before the battle. He insisted that individual owners would put their own slaves to death rather than outsource the task. Anybody failing to kill would be killed himself.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Timur Lung: जब तैमूर लंग ने एक लाख हिंदुओं का लोनी में कराया था कत्लेआम |url=https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/ghaziabad-ncr-when-timur-lung-killed-one-lakh-hindus-in-1398-at-loni-ghaziabad-jagran-special-20708429.html |access-date=2022-05-07 |website=Dainik Jagran |language=hi}}</ref>
