'''Tahoua''' is a city in [[Niger]] and the administrative centre of the [[Tahoua (department)|Department of Tahoua]] and the larger [[Tahoua Region]].<ref>[https://www.fallingrain.com/world/NG/06/Tahoua.html Tahoua, Niger Page]. Falling Rain Genomics, Inc. 1996&ndash;2004</ref> It is the fourth largest town in the country, with a population of 117,826 (2012 Census).<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{Cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/Niger-Cities.html|title=Niger: Regions, Cities & Urban Centers - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information}}</ref>

==Overview==
The city is primarily a [[market town]] for the surrounding agricultural area. It serves as an [[entrepot]] for [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] merchants from the north and [[Fula people|Fulani]] traders from the south. The town is noted for its production of ''tchoukou'' cheese.<ref name="Bradt">Geels, Jolijn, (2006) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Niger'', pgs. 145-55</ref>

It is divided into a pair of urban municipalities: [[Tahoua I]] and [[Tahoua II]]. The town itself is divided into an old town area, and the Sabon Gari ('new town') area to the north.

==History==
Tahoua began as a pair of small villages called Bilbis and Fakoua, and began growing from the 17th century on as various groups began migrating to the area, such as the [[Fulani]] and Tuareg. Various animist (or ''Azna'') peoples began fleeing to the area to escape persecution from Muslim rulers further north.<ref name="Bradt"/> In 1990, Tahoua was reported to have the lowest [[HDI]] score in history, at 0.172.

== Demographics == 
Tahoua is mainly dominated by Fulani , and Tuareg ethnic groups.
