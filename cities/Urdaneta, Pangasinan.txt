'''Urdaneta''', officially the '''City of Urdaneta''' ({{langx|pag|Siyudad na Urdaneta}}; {{langx|ilo|Siyudad ti Urdaneta}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Urdaneta}}), is a 2nd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 144,577 people.{{PH census|current}}

==History==
Urdaneta City was founded on January 8, 1858, by Pangasinenses and Ilocanos who sought greater ties and unity. The city was named after Father [[Andrés de Urdaneta]], a famous aide of Miguel Lopez De Legazpi, who was a soldier, navigator, cosmographer, and evangelist. Father Urdaneta played a significant role in the colonization of the Philippines, as he helped establish the first Spanish settlement on the island of Cebu in 1565. He also helped establish the first trade route between Mexico and the Philippines, which was used for over two centuries.

By naming the city after Father Urdaneta, the people of Urdaneta City pay tribute to his legacy and contributions to the country. His name has become synonymous with exploration, adventure, and faith, all of which are qualities that are celebrated in Urdaneta City. Today, the city continues to honor Father Urdaneta through various events, monuments, and institutions, which serve as reminders of his enduring legacy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Urdaneta City: A Vibrant City Rich in History and Culture |url=https://www.ourpangasinan.com/destination/urdaneta-city-a-vibrant-city-rich-in-history-and-culture/ |website=Our Pangasinan |date=February 15, 2023 |access-date=15 February 2023}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}

Perez Jr., a congressman representing the province.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Urdaneta City |url=https://www.pangasinan.gov.ph/city-municipalities/urdaneta-city/#:~:text=Through%20Rep.,city%20on%20March%2021,%201998. |access-date=2024-09-02 |website=The Official Website of the Province of Pangasinan |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Republic Act No. 8480 |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1998/ra_8480_1998.html#top |access-date=2024-09-02 |website=lawphil.net}}</ref>
