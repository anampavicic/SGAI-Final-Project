The '''City of Carora''', commonly called '''Carora City''' (in Spanish, '''Ciudad de Carora'''), is a city in [[Lara State]], [[Venezuela]], on the Morere River, a branch of the [[Tocuyo River]]. It is about 54 miles southwest of [[Barquisimeto]]. 

==History==
Carora City was founded twice. The first time, in the year 1569 by Juan de Trejo, but due to constant attacks from the indigenous population, it was abandoned, only to be refounded three years later (1572) by Juan de Salmanca. Carora City flourished in colonial times, and grew to a population of nearly 10,000.

==Economy==
As of 1911, the neighboring country was devoted principally to raising horses, mules and cattle; in addition to hides and leather, it exported rubber and other forest products.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Carora|volume=5|pages=381–382}}</ref>  As of 2005 the main economic activity of the area is still cattle ranching, but on milk production and milk products. In the 1990s grapes and wine making became important.
