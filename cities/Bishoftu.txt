'''Bishoftu''' ({{Langx|om|Bishooftuu}}; {{Langx|am|ቢሾፍቱ}}) is a town in central [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[East Shewa Zone]] of the [[Oromia Region]], it sits at an elevation of 1,920 metres (6,300&nbsp;ft). It was formerly known as '''Debre Zeyit''' ({{Langx|am|ደብረ ዘይት||Mount of Olives}}). However, since the late 1990s, it has been officially known by the Oromo name, Bishoftu from bishaanooftuu (which translates to "watery"),<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethiopia|author=Briggs|first=Philip|publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84162-284-2|page=377}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&view=doc&id=272&format=raw&Itemid=521 |title=Oromiya1 |page=22 |work=2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia |year=2007 |publisher=Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA) |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113202722/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&view=doc&id=272&format=raw&Itemid=521 |archive-date=2011-11-13 }}</ref> which was its name until 1955.<ref name=NAI-web>[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB2.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227131228/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB2.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 7 December 2007)</ref> The town serves as the [[Harar Meda Airport|primary airbase]] of the [[Ethiopian Air Force#Air bases|Ethiopian Air Force]].

Bishoftu is located {{convert|47.9|km|abbr=}} southeast of [[Addis Ababa]] along its route 4 highway.<ref name="google">{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps?ll=8.75,38.983333|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|language=en|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref> It is a [[resort town]], known for its several lakes.

== Geography ==
[[File:Lake Hora.JPG|thumb|left|Lake Hora, one of five crater lakes in Bishoftu]]
The town is located within the Bishoftu volcanic field, an area of [[Holocene]] lava flows, [[cinder cone]]s, [[tuff ring]]s and [[maar]]s. Several of the maars are water-filled,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=221220 |title=Bishoftu Volcanic Field |work=[[Global Volcanism Program]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=20 December 2020}}</ref> forming five [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]]s: [[Lake Bishoftu]], [[Lake Hora]] (a base for [[List of water sports|watersports]], many [[water bird]]s and an annual festival), [[Lake Bishoftu Guda]], [[Lake Koriftu]] and the seasonal [[Lake Cheleklaka]]. Other nearby points of interest include [[Mount Yerer]], [[Green Crater Lake]] and [[Lake Hora Kiloli]]. Bishoftu is also home to the [[Ethiopian Air Force]] and the [[Harar Meda Airport]] ([[ICAO]] HAHM, [[IATA]] QHR), as well as a station on the [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]].

== Climate ==
Bishoftu, a town located in the Oromia region of Ethiopia, enjoys a temperate climate that is relatively mild compared to other parts of the country. Nestled at an elevation of around 1,900 meters (6,200 feet) above sea level, Bishoftu benefits from cooler temperatures year-round, making it a pleasant escape from the heat of the lowlands. The town experiences two main seasons: a rainy season from June to September and a dry season from October to May. During the rainy season, Bishoftu is lush and green, with frequent showers that nourish the landscape. In contrast, the dry season brings clear skies and warm, sunny days, though temperatures remain comfortable, rarely reaching extremes. This balanced climate, coupled with the town's picturesque lakes and rolling hills, makes Bishoftu an inviting destination for both residents and visitors.

== History ==
Bishoftu, as a definite entity, did not come into existence until after the [[Second World War]]. Accounts of earlier travelers call the region "Adda", although one Swedish memoir from 1935 mentions a village named "Bishoftu"; the future Cabinet minister [[Makonnen Habte-Wold]] was born in this village. At about {{convert|1|km|mi nmi|abbr=}} from Adda, on land that had been owned partly by Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]], the Italians started ''Azienda Agraria di Biscioftu dell'Opera Nazionale per i Combattenti'' on 15,000 hectares, intending to create a center of colonization as well as an experimental agricultural station. The first foundation stone for the houses was laid 9 December 1937, but only 21 dwellings were ready by May 1938. Various administrative and service buildings were also built.<ref name=NAI-web/>

The history of the Ethiopian Air Force is tightly woven with the history of Bishoftu. In 1946, the beginnings of what would become the [[Ethiopian Air Force]] was moved from [[Lideta Army Airport|Lideta airport]] in [[Addis Ababa]], which was needed by [[Ethiopian Airlines]], to Bishoftu. The initial group of 19 [[Sweden|Swedes]] under Count [[Carl Gustaf von Rosen]], who were to train the pilots and support personal, arrived there after leaving Sweden between 9 January and 16 July 1946. Both Ethiopian cadets and the Swedish instructors took part in constructing the first buildings on the base. Six [[Saab 91 Safir]] training airplanes were bought in Sweden and flown to the new airbase 24 December 1946, and on 10 November 1947, a fleet of 16 Saab-built [[B-17]]s were landed at Bishoftu by Swedish pilots.<ref name=NAI-web/>

Bishoftu has had telephone service since 1954.

Bishoftu Technical High School was established in 1958 with a 5-year course for boys 12–15 years of age. An Evangelical College had been founded two years before, which was a joint undertaking of Swedish, Norwegian, and German Evangelical missions. The Evangelical College's first headmaster was [[Sven Rubenson]]. The Animal Health Assistants Training School was established in Bishoftu in 1963, with financial support by the [[United Nations Special Fund]].<ref name=NAI-web/>

The artist [[Lemma Tesefa Kesime]] was born (1956) in Bishoftu. He studied at the Art School 1972-1974 and received his M.A. from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1983. Returning to Ethiopia, Lemma Tesefa became a teacher at the art school in Addis Ababa.<ref name=NAI-web/> Bishoftu was also the favored weekend retreat of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], who built a palace in the town, named "Fairfield" after his [[Fairfield House, Bath|wartime home]] in exile in the town of Bath, England.

Armed forces of the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] bypassed the capital and occupied Bishoftu in May, 1991, bringing order to the area after the collapse of the [[Mengistu Haile Mariam|Mengistu]] government, taking control of what remained of the Soviet-supplied Air Force. The airbase was also used to detain several dozen senior military officers after the capture of the capital.<ref>{{cite book |last= Henze|first= Paul B. |title= Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia|year= 2000|publisher= Palgrave|location= New York|isbn=0-312-22719-1|page= 332}}</ref>
On 2 October 2016 at [[Irreechaa]] celebration security forces fired tear gas at protesters forcing them to panic and as a result 52 people lost their lives after falling into ditches around Lake Hora.

On 10 March 2019, [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] crashed near the town of Bishoftu. All 157 people aboard perished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-47513534|title=Ethiopian Airlines crash - latest updates|website=BBC News|date=10 March 2019 |language=en|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>
