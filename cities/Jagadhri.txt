'''Jagadhri''' is a [[city]] and a [[municipal council]] in the [[Yamunanagar district]] of the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Haryana]]. This town lies adjacent to the city of [[Yamunanagar]]. The demarcation line between the two is difficult to discern. Jagadhri is around 90
&nbsp;km away from [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of Haryana state. This town is known for the cluster of brass and copper industries. Jagadhri is known as the "Brass City" of India.&nbsp;

==Etymology==
Jagadhri, corrupted form of its old name Yugandhari, was  named after the king of the Yugandharas. Yugandharas find mention in [[Mahabharata]] as well as Buddhist texts as region with warriors or mountains. Yugandhara likely was used for a region  inhabited by a tribe of that name and it comprised some mountainous tracts also which were given the same name.<ref name=sadh2>[http://haryanajobalert.com/Admin/Upload/YJQMLC7Wyamunanagar.pdf Yamunanagar History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215124753/http://haryanajobalert.com/Admin/Upload/YJQMLC7Wyamunanagar.pdf |date=15 December 2017 }}, Gazatteer of Haryana: Yamunanagar.</ref>

==History==
[[File:Detail of the former Jagadhri State post-annexation by the British from a map created by the British East India Company of the Malwa region of Punjab showing the various polities, borders, and settlements of the area, ca.1829–1835.jpg|thumb|Detail of the former Jagadhri State post-annexation by the British from a map created by the British East India Company, ca.1829–1835.]]
Excavations have found the punch marked square coins, a Greek [[Ancient drachma|hemidrachm]] coin of [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek king]] [[Apollodotus I]] or [[Apollodotus II]] (1st and 2nd century BCE ) and one of [[Antimachus I]]/[[Antimachus II]] (2nd century BCE), a gold coin  of [[Samudragupta]] (ruled 336-380 CE) and other coins of the period up to the [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] and [[Tomara dynasty]] kings of Delhi. It was likely the capital city of a [[Janapada]].<ref name=sadh2/>
There are few places which have signs of [[Ashoka]] like [[Topra Kalan|Topra kalan]], Chaneti, Sugh and [[Lohgarh]]. Topra kalan is the place where the Ashoka pillar having Pali inscriptions was originally installed by Ashoka. This pillar was uprooted by Mughal invader [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Ferozeshah Tughlaq]] and was moved to Delhi and reinstalled. Chaneti has one full size Buddhist stupa excavated similar to those found in [[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]]. Sugh also had signs of Buddhism which have been razed by local natives. 

The town was known historically for its metal work and brass ware including utensils. Nowadays{{when|date=July 2015}} production of brass ware has fallen off, due to high costs and the city has successfully transitioned to the manufacture of aluminium and stainless steel products. Moreover, Jagadhri has also witnessed the growth of a new timber trade in the last decade.{{when|date=July 2015}}

There are many old temples, such as LathMar Mandir, Khera Mandir, Gauri Shankar Mandir and Guga Madi Mandir, Devi Mandir (Mansa Devi).
