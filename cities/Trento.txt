It is the capital of the [[Trentino|autonomous province of Trento]]. In the 16th century, the city was the location of the [[Council of Trent]]. Formerly part of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], it was annexed by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in 1919.

Trento is an educational, scientific, financial and political centre in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], in [[Tyrol]] and [[Northern Italy]] in general. The city contains a [[picturesque]] Medieval and Renaissance historic centre, with ancient buildings such as [[Trento Cathedral]] and the [[Castello del Buonconsiglio]].

Together with other Alpine towns Trento engages in the [[Alpine Town of the Year]] Association for the implementation of the [[Alpine Convention]] to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Trento was awarded the title of Alpine Town of the Year 2004.

In the last twenty years, thanks to the gradual creation of various research centers (FBK, FEM) and laboratories in the IT, engineering and sciences fields, Trento and its university have been nicknamed the "Silicon Valley of the Alps".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Savio|first=Irene|date=2013-05-30|title=» El 'Silicon Valley' italiano - Esglobal - Política, economía e ideas sobre el mundo en español|url=https://www.esglobal.org/el-silicon-valley-italiano/|access-date=2021-11-02|language=es}}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of Trento|Prince-Bishopric of Trent}}

The origins of this city on the river-route to [[Bolzano]] and the low Alpine passes of [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]] and the [[Reschen Pass]]<ref>Griffith Taylor, "Trento to the Reschen Pass: A Cultural Traverse of the Adige Corridor", ''Geographical Review'' '''30'''.2 (April 1940:215–237), "The site and evolution of the town of Trento", pp 220-.</ref> over the Alps are disputed. Some scholars maintain it was a [[Rhaetia]]n settlement: the Adige area was however influenced by neighbouring populations, including the [[Adriatic Veneti|(Adriatic) Veneti]], the [[Etruscans]] and the [[Gaul]]s (a [[Celt]]ic population). According to other theories, the latter instead founded the city during the 4th century BC.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

Trento was conquered by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century BC, after several clashes with the Rhaetian tribes. Before the Romans, Trento was a Celtic village. [[Julius Caesar]] re-founded it as a Roman municipality when [[Lex Roscia|Rome extended citizenship]] to the part of Cisalpine Gaul north of the River Po.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cooley|first=Alison E.|author-link=Alison E. Cooley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bChcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA285|title=A Companion to Roman Italy|date=2016-01-05|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99311-8|pages=285|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ando|first1=Clifford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4ElDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127|title=Ancient States and Infrastructural Power: Europe, Asia, and America|last2=Richardson|first2=Seth|date=2017-05-26|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-9417-0|pages=127|language=en}}</ref> The Latin name given to the settlement was ''Tridentum,'' meaning "Three-teeth place" or "Trident-town" ({{lang|la|tri-}} "three" + {{lang|la|dēns, dent-}} "tooth"). The reason for the name is uncertain: the new town may have been consecrated to the god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], or possibly named after the three hills that surround the city (known in Italian as ''Doss Trento'', ''Doss di Sant'Agata'' and ''Doss di San Rocco''). The Latin name is the source of the adjective "tridentine". On the old city hall, a [[Latin]] inscription is still visible: "''Montes argentum mihi dant nomenque Tridentum''" ("Mountains give me silver and the name of Trento"), attributed to Fra' Bartolomeo da Trento (died in 1251). Tridentum became an important stop on the [[Roman road]] that led from [[Verona]] to [[Innsbruck]].<ref>Taylor 1940:221.</ref>

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the independent bishopric of Trento was conquered by [[Ostrogoths]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Lombards]] and [[Franks]], finally becoming part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1027, Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] created the [[Prince-Bishops of Trento]], who wielded both temporal and religious powers.{{cn|date=December 2022}} In the following centuries, however, the sovereignty was divided between the [[Prince-Bishopric of Trent|Bishopric of Trent]] and the [[County of Tyrol]] (from 1363 part of the Habsburg monarchy). Around 1200, Trento became a mining center of some significance: silver was mined from the Monte Calisio – Khalisperg, and Prince-Bishop [[Federico Wanga]] issued the first mining code of the alpine region.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

In the 14th century, the [[Habsburg]] Family that ruled as dukes of [[Austria]] were also the counts of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]].

A dark episode in the history of Trento was the Trento [[blood libel]]. When a 3-year-old Christian boy, Simonino, later known as [[Simon of Trent]], disappeared in 1475 on the eve of [[Good Friday]], the city's small Jewish community was accused of killing him and draining his blood for Jewish ritual purposes.<ref name="iht.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/04/arts/conway.php|publisher=iht.com|title=The New York Times – Breaking News, World News & Multimedia|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref> Eight Jews were tortured and burned at the stake, and their families forced to convert to Christianity. The bishop of Trento, Johannes Hinderbach, sought (without success) to have Simonino canonized and published the first book printed in Trento, ''"Story of a Christian Child Murdered at Trento"'', embellished with 12 woodcuts.<ref name="iht.com"/> In a governmental ceremony in the 1990s, Trento apologized to the Jewish community for this dark episode and unveiled a plaque commemorating the formal apology.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

In the 16th century, Trento became notable for the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) which gave rise to the [[Counter-Reformation]].{{cn|date=December 2022}} The adjective ''Tridentine'' (as in "Tridentine Mass") literally means pertaining to Trento, but can also refer to that specific event. Among the notable prince-bishops of this time were [[Bernardo Clesio]] (who governed the city from 1514 to 1539 and managed to steer the council to Trento) and [[Cristoforo Madruzzo]] (who governed from 1539 to 1567), both able European politicians and Renaissance [[humanism|humanists]], who greatly expanded and embellished the city.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

During this period, and as an expression of this Humanism, Trento was also known as the site of a [[Jewish]] printing press. In 1558 Cardinal Madruzzo granted the privilege of printing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Rabbinic literature|books]] to Joseph Ottolengo, a German [[rabbi]]. The actual printer was [[Jacob Marcaria]], a local physician; after his death in 1562, the activity of the press of Riva di Trento ceased. Altogether, 34 works were published in the period from 1558 to 1562, most of them bearing the coat of arms of Madruzzo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=314&letter=R |title=Riva Di Trento |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |access-date=2010-04-22}}</ref>

Prince-bishops governed Trento until the Napoleonic era, when it changed hands among various states. Under the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss|reorganization of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1802, the Bishopric was secularized and annexed to the [[Habsburg]] territories. The [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in 1805 ceded Trento to [[Bavaria]], and the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] four years later gave it to Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]].{{cn|date=December 2022}}

The population staged armed resistance to French domination.{{cn|date=December 2022}} The resistance leader was [[Andreas Hofer]]. During his youth, he lived in Italian Tyrol, where he learned the [[Italian language]]. When Hofer recovered Trento for the Austrians (1809), he was welcomed with enthusiasm by the population of Trento. Approximately 4,000 Trentinian volunteers (''Sìzzeri'' or ''Schützen'') died in battle against the French and Bavarian troops. In 1810, Hofer was captured and brought to [[Mantua]], and was shot by French soldiers on the express order of Napoleon.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

With Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Trento was annexed by the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. Church government was finally extinguished, and Trento was henceforth governed by the secular administration of [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]. In the following decades, Trento experienced a modernization of administration and economy with the first railroad in the Adige valley opening in 1859.  The entire Mediterranean basin was at risk of malaria, a factor that affected the entire Italian peninsula and this Alpine region was not spared. Even Tuscany was particularly hard hit; malaria existed far inland into the Veneto area, reaching the Italian Alps.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc= 3340992 | pmid=22550561 | doi=10.4084/MJHID.2012.016 | volume=4 | title=Short history of malaria and its eradication in Italy with short notes on the fight against the infection in the mediterranean basin | year=2012 | journal=Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis | page=e2012016 | author=Majori, G| issue=1 }}</ref> From 1918 to 1940, government figures show Italy's malaria deaths decreased by 96%, due to the efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation and Italy's own malaria experts, who themselves were international leaders in [[malariology]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://rockarch.org/publications/resrep/hall.pdf | title=Today Sardinia, Tomorrow the World: Malaria, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Mosquito Eradication | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617153350/http://www.rockarch.org/publications/resrep/hall.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-17}}</ref>

During the late 19th century, Trento and [[Trieste]], cities with ethnic Italian majorities still belonging to the Austrians, became icons of the Italian [[irredentist]] movement.{{cn|date=December 2022}} [[Benito Mussolini]] briefly joined the staff of a local newspaper in 1909, but left Trento because they could not create an anti-Austrian group. There was dissatisfaction with the lack of provincial autonomy and the failure to establish a university for the region. Feelings of loyalty were focused on the 'father-figure' emperor, not for Austria.  
[[File:Il Mausoleo di Cesare Battisti, a Trento.jpg|left|thumb|Mausoleum of [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]]]]
The nationalist cause led Italy into [[World War I]]. Damiano Chiesa and the deputy in the Austrian parliament [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] were two well-known local irredentists who had joined the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] to fight against Austria-Hungary with the aim of bringing the territory of Trento into the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The two men were taken prisoners at the nearby southern front. They were put on trial for high treason and executed in the courtyard of [[Castello del Buonconsiglio]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

The region was greatly affected during the war, and some of its fiercest battles were fought on the surrounding mountains in the southernmost regions and the southeast. Of a population of just less than 400,000 in the province, 55,000 men served in the Imperial and Royal Army of whom 11,000 died.{{cn|date=November 2022}} Most served on the Galician front; 700 served with the Italian Army. After [[World War I]], Trento and its Italian-speaking province, along with [[Bolzano]] (Bozen) and the part of Tyrol that stretched south of the Alpine watershed (which was primarily [[German language|German]]-speaking, as still is to this day), were annexed by Italy.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

In July 1943 Mussolini was removed as Prime Minister when the allies invaded Sicily. Italy surrendered to the Allies, and declared war on Germany. German troops promptly invaded northern Italy and the provinces of Trento, [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] and [[South Tyrol]] became part of the [[Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills]], annexed to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Some German-speakers wanted revenge upon Italian-speakers living in the area, but were mostly prevented by the occupying German troops, who still considered Mussolini head of the [[Italian Social Republic]] and wanted to preserve good relations with the Italians.{{cn|date=December 2022}} From November 1944 to April 1945, Trento was bombed as part of the so-called "Battle of the Brenner". War supplies from Germany to support the [[Gothic Line]] were for the most part routed via the rail line through the Brenner Pass. Over 6,849 sorties were flown by the Allies over targets from [[Verona]] to the [[Brenner Pass]], with 10,267 tons of bombs dropped. Parts of the city were hit by the Allied bombings, including the church of S. Maria Maggiore, the Church of the Annunciation and several bridges over the [[Adige]] river. In spite of the bombings, most of the medieval and renaissance city center was spared. It was finally liberated on 3 May 1945.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

In 1947, Trento became the host of the [[Rally Stella Alpina]].

Since the 1950s, the region has enjoyed prosperous growth, thanks in part to its special autonomy from the central Italian government.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

On 4 August 2015, the cathedral tower caught fire by "spontaneous combustion". The clock stopped at 10:50 AM, a matter of minutes after the fire began.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

In 2020, Trento was listed as the most sustainable city in Italy, according to the Smart City Index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartgreenpost.com/2020/03/03/smart-city-index-2020-trento-is-the-most-sustainable-city-in-italy/|title=Smart City Index 2020, Trento is the most sustainable city in Italy {{!}} SmartGreen Post {{!}} news from the environment|last=Vincenti|first=Piera|date=3 March 2020|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

== Geography ==
The township of Trento encompasses the city centre as well as many suburbs of extremely varied geographical and population conditions (from the industrial suburb of Gardolo, just north of the city, to tiny mountain hamlets on Monte Bondone). Various distinctive suburbs still retain their traditional identity of rural or mountain villages.

Trento lies in a wide [[glacial valley]] known as the [[Adige|Adige valley]], just south of the [[Dolomite Mountains]], where the Fersina River and [[Avisio River|Avisio]] rivers join the [[Adige|Adige River]] (the second longest river in Italy). River Adige is one of the three primary south-flowing Alpine rivers; its broadly curving course alongside Trento was straightened in 1850.<ref>Taylor 1940:215, 224.</ref> The valley is surrounded by mountains, including Vigolana ({{convert|2,150|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Monte Bondone ({{convert|2,181|m|ft|abbr=on}}), [[Paganella]] ({{convert|2,124|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Marzola ({{convert|1,747|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Monte Calisio]] ({{convert|1,096|m|ft|abbr=on}}). Nearby lakes include [[Lake Caldonazzo]], Lake Levico, [[Lake Garda]] and Lake Toblino.

=== Climate ===
The municipality of Trento stretches across a wide range of altitude levels, going from just under 200 m above sea level at the city centre, to 400 m in Povo and Cognola, to 2000 m above sea level at Monte Bondone, boroughs at higher elevation, for instance [[Viote Alpine Botanical Garden|Viote]], have a colder alpine climate (''Dw''). Urban Trento has a [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]]-[[Humid continental climate|continental]] climate (''Cfa''-''Dfa'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]].  Monthly average temperatures range between 1.6&nbsp;°C (January) and 23.4&nbsp;°C (July).  Average annual precipitation exceeds 900&nbsp;mm spread out on an average of 87 days, with peaks in late spring (May–June, 90&nbsp;mm monthly average in 9–10 rain days) and autumn (October–November: 100–110&nbsp;mm monthly average in 7–8 days), and lows in winter (January–February, 30–40&nbsp;mm monthly average in 3–4 rain days). Winters are cold to freezing, with infrequent snowfall but usual frost from mid-November to mid-March.{{cn|date=December 2022}} In winter, daytime highs may not exceed 5&nbsp;°C and lows may rarely dip down to -10&nbsp;°C, but the former usually stand around 8°C, while the latter usually hover between -3&nbsp;°C to 0&nbsp;°C. Spring brings unpredictable weather with wind blowing north to south or vice-versa through the valley. Many spring days are pleasant, but the transition may be very quick, for example going from frosty mornings to 30&nbsp;°C in two months. In May, it is possible to have either rainy days with daytime highs below 18&nbsp;°C, or sunny days with the temperature soaring up to 30&nbsp;°C. Summers are hot, sometimes sweltering, with highs getting to 35&nbsp;°C at least for a week a year and more rarely to 38&nbsp;°C.{{cn|date=December 2022}} Summer nights can be hot as well, with overnight lows hovering around 22-24&nbsp;°C (in the hilly suburbs east, north and west of Trento summer nights can be much cooler, with overnight temperature differing by up to 6&nbsp;°C from the ones experienced in the city centre{{cn|date=December 2022}}). Early fall is pleasant, with foliage starting around mid-October at higher elevations, late October in the uphill suburbs and in November downtown. Fall days can be humid, grey and dim, with temperatures rapidly declining through October and November. The first snowfall in the suburbs may occur as early as late November, with December and early January being the snowiest period of the year.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

== Economy ==
[[File:Pergola trentino.JPG|thumb|left|Vineyard in Trento]]

The city owes much of its unique economy to its position along the main communication route between Italy and Northern Europe and to the Adige river which, prior to its diversion in the mid-19th century, ran through the center of the city. The Adige river was formerly a navigable river and one of the main commercial routes in the Alps. The original course of the river is now covered by the Via Torre Vanga, Via Torre Verde and the Via Alessandro Manzoni.

As late as World War II, Trento depended on wine-making and silk.<ref>Taylor 40:224.</ref> Sparkling wine made in the Trentino province is part of the [[Trento DOC]] classification. The manufacturing industry installed in the post-war period has been mostly dismantled. Today, Trento thrives on commerce, services, tourism, high-quality agriculture and food industry (including wine and fruit), as a research and conference center thanks to a small but renowned [[University of Trento|university]] and internationally renowned research centers such as ''Fondazione Bruno Kessler'', active in both fundamental and applied research, the Italian-German Historical Institute, the Centre for Computational and Systems Biology  and ECT*, active in theoretical nuclear studies and part of FBK, and as logistics and transportation thoroughfare.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

Valued pink and white [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] are still excavated from some surrounding areas (Pila).{{cn|date=December 2022}} This stone can be seen in many of Trento's buildings, both new and old.

=== Economy Festival of Trento ===

The Festival dell’Economia di Trento (Economy Festival of Trento) was brought into being in 2006{{cn|date=December 2022}} in order to enable and facilitate discussions between economists and a broad public. The aim of this festival is to put economic terminology across to everyone. The festival takes place every year at the end of May on the historic Palazzi of the old town in Trento. Well known economists explain and interpret current economic issues, both from an economic-scientific as well as from a social and entrepreneurial viewpoint. In the course of recent years, numerous economic scholars and managers such as Sir [[Tony Atkinson|Anthony Atkinson]], [[Fan Gang]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and the Nobel Prize winner [[Gary Becker]] took an active part.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trentino.com/en/highlights/tradition-and-culture/economy-festival-trento/|title=Economy Festival Trento|publisher=trentino.com|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>

== Politics ==
=== Government ===
{{See also|List of mayors of Trento}}
Trento is governed by the City Council of Trento. Voters elect directly 40 councilors and the mayor of Trento every five years. The current mayor of Trento is [[Franco Ianeselli]], elected for the first time on 21 September 2020. Ianeselli, a former trade unionist, was elected as a left-leaning independent with the support of a wide coalition of parties. These parties ranged from the left (as in the case of Europa Verde) to the Catholic centre (including Partito Autonomista Trentino Tirolese, and Insieme per Trento). When determining the composition of his Giunta (the equivalent of a City Cabinet), Ianeselli selected seven members of the City Council: Monica Baggia, Elisabetta Bozzarelli, Mariachiara Franzoia, Chiara Maule, Salvatore Panetta, Roberto Stanchina, and Paolo Zanella. However, in late November 2020 Paolo Zanella announced he would leave his position as a member of the Giunta, in order to fill a vacancy in one of the 35 seats of the legislative assembly of the Trentino province, upon the resignation of member Paolo Ghezzi. Shortly after, mayor Ianeselli announced Ezio Facchin as Zanella's successor.

=== Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino ===
In 1996, a joint session between the states, further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of [[Tyrol]] and the Italian autonomous provinces of [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]] was mutually agreed on.<ref>{{cite web |title=GEMEINSAME SITZUNG DER LANDTAGE VON SÜDTIROL, TIROL, TRENTINO SOWIE VORARLBERGER LANDTAG MIT BEOBACHTERSTATUS |url=https://www.consiglio.provincia.tn.it/istituzione/dreier-landtag/dreier-landtag-1996/Documents/04-96.pdf}}</ref> This activity was steadily extended, eventually followed by the creation of the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=The European Region Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino |url=https://www.unitn.it/en/ateneo/110230/the-european-region-tyrol-south-tyrol-trentino |publisher=University of Trento}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino Euroregion |url=https://www.mci.edu/en/alumni-rueckblick/5821-tyrol-south-tyrol-trentino-euroregion |website=MCI - the enterpreneurial school distinguished lecture series |access-date=30 May 2024}}</ref>

[[File:Palazzo pretorio di Trento.jpg|thumb|right|Palazzo pretorio and duomo]]
[[File:20110727 Trento Buonconsiglio Castle 6609.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buonconsiglio Castle]]]]

Although off the beaten path of mass tourism, Trento offers rather interesting monuments. Its architecture has a unique feel, with both Italian Renaissance and Roman influences. The city center is small, and most Late-Medieval and Renaissance buildings have been restored to their original pastel colours and wooden balconies. Part of the medieval city walls is still visible in Piazza Fiera, along with a circular tower. Once, these walls encircled the entire city and were connected to the Castello del Buonconsiglio.
The main monuments of the city include:
* '''''[[Trento Cathedral|Cattedrale di San Vigilio]]''''' (Cathedral of [[Saint Vigilius]]), also known as '''''Duomo di Trento''''' (12th–13thcentury) is a Romanesque-Gothic cathedral built on top of a late-Roman basilica (viewable in an underground crypt).
* '''''Piazza Duomo''''' (1767–1768), on the side of the cathedral, has frescoed Renaissance buildings and the Late Baroque Fountain of Neptune (''Fontana di Nettuno'').
* '''[[Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento|Church of Santa Maria Maggiore]]''' (1520), site of the preparatory congregations of the Third Council of Trent (April 1562 – December 1563). It was built for Bishop [[Bernardo Clesio]] by the architect Antonio Medaglia in Renaissance-Gothic style. The façade has a notable 16th-century portal, while the interior has works by [[Giambettino Cignaroli]] and [[Gian Battista Moroni|Moroni]].
* '''''Castello del Buonconsiglio''''' ('''[[Buonconsiglio Castle]]''') (13th century), which includes a museum and the notable Torre dell'Aquila, with a cycle of fine Gothic frescoes depicting the months, was commissioned by the prince-bishop Georg von Lichtenstein.
* '''Church of San Pietro''' (12th century) features a neo-Gothic façade added in 1848–1850.
* '''Church of Sant'Apollinare''' (13th century) is a Gothic church.
* '''Church of San Lorenzo''' (12th century) features a Romanesque apse.
* '''''Torre Verde''''' ('''Green Tower'''), along the former transit path of the [[Adige]] river, is said to be where persons executed in the name of the Prince-Bishop were deposited in the river.
* '''''[[Palazzo delle Albere]]''''' ('''Palace of the Trees'''), a Renaissance villa next to the Adige river built around 1550 by the Madruzzo family, now hosting a modern art museum.
* '''''Palazzo Pretorio''''' (12th century), next to the Duomo, with a bell tower (''Torre Civica'') of the 13th century that now hosts a collection of baroque paintings of religious themes. It was the main Bishops' residence until the mid-13th century.
* '''''[[Palazzo Salvadori]]''''' (1515) is one of the first examples of Renaissance civil architecture in the city.
* '''''Palazzo Geremia''''' (15th century) features a Renaissance exterior and Gothic interiors.
* '''''Palazzo Lodron''''', built during the Council of Trent. The interior has a large fresco cycle.
* Various underground remains of the streets and villas of the Roman city (in Via Prepositura and Piazza Cesare Battisti).

Trento also sports [[modernist]] architecture, including the train station and the central post office, both by rationalist architect [[Angiolo Mazzoni]]. In particular, the train station (1934–36) is considered a landmark building of Italian railways architecture and combines many varieties of local stone with the most advanced building materials of the time: glass, reinforced concrete, metal. The post office was once decorated with colored windows by [[Fortunato Depero]], but these were destroyed during bombings in World War II. Other buildings of that time include the Grand Hotel by Giovanni Lorenzi with some guest rooms furnished with futurist furniture by Depero, and the "R. Sanzio" Primary School built in 1931–34 and designed by [[Adalberto Libera]].
