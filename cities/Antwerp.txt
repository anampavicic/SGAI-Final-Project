Both economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the [[Low Countries]], especially before and during the [[Sack of Antwerp|Spanish Fury]] (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent [[Dutch Revolt]].

There is a [[folklore]] tradition that the name ''Antwerpen'' is from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|handwerpen}} ("hand-throwing"). A [[giant (mythology)|giant]] called [[Druon Antigoon|Antigoon]] is said to have lived near the [[Scheldt]] river and extracted a toll from passing boatmen. He severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named [[Silvius Brabo]], who cut off the giant's own hand and flung that into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by [[Brabo Fountain|a statue]] (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the {{lang|nl|[[Grote Markt (Antwerp)|Grote Markt]]|italic=no}}.<ref>Legenden en Mythen [http://www.figy.be/legenden/Antwerpen_Brabo.htm Legende van Brabo en de reus Antigoon]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201213033/http://www.figy.be/legenden/Antwerpen_Brabo.htm|date=1 December 2010}} {{in lang|nl}}</ref><ref name="belgiumview.com"/>

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Pre-1500===
Historical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman ''[[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]]''. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt in 1952–1961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. In the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]].<ref name="Antwerp" />

The [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] Antwerp was evangelized by [[Saint Amand]] in the 7th century. ''[[Het Steen]]'' Castle has its origins in the [[Carolingian]] period in the 9th century. The castle may have been built after the Viking incursions in the early Middle Ages; in 879 the [[Normans]] invaded Flanders. The surviving structure was built between 1200 and 1225 as a gateway to a larger castle of the Dukes of Brabant which was demolished in the 19th century. It is Antwerp's oldest building.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Het Steen, Antwerp, Belgium - SpottingHistory.com|url=https://www.spottinghistory.com/view/5428/het-steen/|access-date=2022-05-05|website=www.spottinghistory.com|language=en|archive-date=28 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128191335/https://www.spottinghistory.com/view/5428/het-steen/|url-status=live}}</ref> At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Antwerp became a [[Margraviate of Antwerp|margraviate]] in 980, by the German emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]], a border province facing the [[County of Flanders]].

In the 11th century, the best-known leader of the [[First Crusade]] (1096–1099), [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], was originally [[Margraviate of Antwerp#Margraves of Antwerp|Margrave of Antwerp]], from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of [[Lower Lorraine]] (1087–1100) and [[King of Jerusalem|Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] (1099–1100). In the 12th century, [[Norbert of Xanten]] established a community of his [[Premonstratensian|Premonstratensian canons]] at [[St. Michael's Abbey, Antwerp|St. Michael's Abbey]] at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] during his early negotiations with [[Jacob van Artevelde]], and his son [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel]], the [[Duke of Clarence]], was born there in 1338.<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Antwerp (city)|volume=02|pages=155–156|last1=Boulger|first1=Demetrius Charles}}</ref>

===16th century===
After the silting-up of the [[Zwin]] and the consequent decline of [[Bruges]], Antwerp, then part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], grew in importance, with the city doubling its population between 1500 and 1569.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last1=Hagen|first1=Rainer|title=Bruegel: The Complete Paintings|last2=Marie|first2=Rose|publisher=Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-5991-9|location=Germany|pages=15}}</ref> At the end of the 15th century, the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510.<ref name="EB1911"/> During this time, the old Mediterranean trade routes were gradually losing importance and the discovery of new sea routes via Africa to Asia and via the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to America helped push Antwerp to a position of prominence.<ref name=":1" />

By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, [[wine]]s from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and [[wheat]] from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its [[Bourse at Antwerp|bourse]] opened in 1531, "To the merchants of all nations."<ref>Peter Gay and R.K. Webb, ''Modern Europe to 1815'' (1973), p. 210.</ref>

[[File:Jan Wildens - View of the city of Antwerp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of Antwerp by [[Jan Wildens]]]]

Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly with [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] as the century progressed.<ref>Tom Monaghan, ''Renaissance, Reformation and the Age of Discovery, 1450–1700'' (Heinemann, 2002)</ref> The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially [[Cologne]].<ref>Donald J. Harreld, "Atlantic Sugar and Antwerp's Trade with Germany in the Sixteenth Century," ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'', 2003, Vol. 7 Issue 1/2, pp 148–163</ref> Antwerp also had an unusually high number of painters, around 360 in 1560, in a city with a population of roughly 89,000 in 1569 (250 people per painter), it was the most important artistic centre north of the [[Alps]], serving notable painters such as [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].<ref name=":1" /> Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544–1574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe.

[[Fernand Braudel]] states that Antwerp became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height."<ref>(Braudel 1985 p. 143.)</ref> Antwerp had the highest growth rate and was the richest city in Europe at the time.<ref name="world and its people">{{cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|url=https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop01duntgoog|publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop01duntgoog/page/n169 163]}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Antwerp's [[Golden Age]] is tightly linked to the "[[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]]". During the first half of the 16th century, Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps. Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier "It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas".<ref name="golden age" />

Without a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreign-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from [[Venetian Republic|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Spain]] and Portugal. Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-[[History of the Jews in Antwerp|Jewish]] community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Isidore Singer|editor2=Cyrus Adler|entry=Antwerp|encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia|entry-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47o5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA658|year=1916|pages=658–660|title=Archived copy|access-date=8 February 2018|archive-date=1 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201225552/https://books.google.com/books?id=47o5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA658|url-status=live}}</ref>

Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from [[Seville]] (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilizing [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century, Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade.<ref name="golden age">Luc-Normand Tellier (2009).

PUQ. p.308. {{ISBN|2-7605-1588-5}}</ref> The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers. In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically. The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth. Numerous financial bankruptcies began around 1557. [[Amsterdam]] replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.<ref>Gay and Webb, ''Modern Europe to 1815'' (1973), p. 210-11.</ref>

====Reformation era====
The religious revolution of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the [[Low Countries]]. The regent [[Margaret of Parma|Margaret, Duchess of Parma]], was swept aside when [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] sent the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] at the head of an army the following summer. When the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch revolt against Spain]] broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of [[Bilbao]] collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called [[Sack of Antwerp|Spanish Fury]]: 8,000 citizens were massacred, several houses burnt down, and over £2 million sterling of damage was done.

====Dutch revolt====
[[File:1593 Valckenborch Ansicht von Antwerpen mit zugefrorener Schelde anagoria.JPG|thumb|View of Antwerp with the frozen Scheldt (1590) by [[Lucas van Valckenborch]]]]

Subsequently, the city joined the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and became the capital of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. In 1585, [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza]], captured it after a [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|long siege]] and as part of the terms of surrender its [[Protestantism|Protestant]] citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Boxer |first=C.

Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by [[Genoa]], and [[Amsterdam]] became the new trading centre.

===17th–19th centuries===

The recognition of the independence of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] by the [[Peace of Münster|Treaty of Münster]] in 1648 stipulated that the [[Scheldt]] should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom of the United Netherlands]] (1815 to 1830).<ref name="EB1911"/> Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock), an [[Lock (water transport)|access-lock]] and [[Mole (architecture)|mole]], and deepening the Scheldt to allow larger ships to approach Antwerp.<ref name="world and its people"/> Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] before he could see the plan through.<ref name="world and its people2">{{cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|url=https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog|publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog/page/n172 164]}}</ref>
In 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General [[David Hendrik Chassé]]. For a time, Chassé subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832, the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal [[Gerard]]. During this attack, the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chassé made an honourable surrender, ending the [[Siege of Antwerp (1832)]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

Later that century, a double ring of [[Brialmont]] Fortresses was constructed some {{cvt|10|km|0}} from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a [[Antwerp International Exposition (1894)|World's Fair]] attended by 3&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pelle|first=Kimberley D|editor1-first=John E|editor1-last=Findling|title=Encyclopedia of World's Fairs and Expositions|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc|isbn=978-0-7864-3416-9|page=414|year=2008}}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Willy Stöwer - Antwerpen 1914.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Belgium in World War I|German bombardment of Antwerp]], October 1914, by [[Willy Stöwer]]]]

Antwerp was the first city to host the [[World Gymnastics Championships]], in 1903. During [[World War I]], the city became the fallback point of the [[Belgian Army]] after the defeat at [[Liège]]. The [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|Siege of Antwerp]] lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation]] until the Armistice. A few years later, Antwerp hosted the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].

During [[World War II]], the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|occupied by Germany]] on 18 May 1940 and liberated by the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 11th Armoured Division]] on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the [[Port of Antwerp]], which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of [[Rheinbote]], [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2]] missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (and particularly [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]) [[Orthodox Judaism]].

A Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956–1965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.<ref>Michael Ryckewaert, ''[[Planning Perspectives]]'', July 2010, Vol. 25 Issue 3, pp 303–322.</ref>

Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with [[London]], [[Milan]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Paris]]. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.<ref>Javier Gimeno Martínez, "Selling Avant-garde: How Antwerp Became a Fashion Capital (1990–2002)," ''[[Urban Studies (journal)|Urban Studies]]'' November 2007, Vol. 44 Issue 1３, pp 2449–2464</ref>

==Districts==

In 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the [[Port of Antwerp]], the municipalities of [[Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo]] were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of [[Berchem]], [[Borgerhout]], [[Deurne, Belgium|Deurne]], [[Ekeren]], [[Hoboken, Antwerp|Hoboken]], [[Merksem]] and [[Wilrijk]] were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Koenraad|last1=De Ceuninck|title=De gemeentelijke fusies van 1976. Een mijlpaal voor de lokale besturen in België|publisher=Die keure, Brugge|date=2009}}</ref>

The neighboring municipality of [[Borsbeek]] has declared the intention to become the tenth district of the city of Antwerp. However, the final decision has not been made and a non-binding citizens vote on the matter is scheduled for September 2023.

With the exception of Ekeren and Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo, all the districts form together one contiguous inhabited area. The former town halls have been converted into district halls and the former town centers are now local main streets within the larger urban agglomeration.

== Neighborhoods ==

=== In the district of Antwerp ===
The historical city of Antwerp consists nowadays of the following neighborhoods. For a few of them, the postal code has become a cultural reference.

==== The inner city - 2000 ====
Encompassing the area between the river and the Spanish fortification walls, this is the historical heart of Antwerp. On the place of the Spanish walls is now an avenue called ''de Leien'' in Dutch or ''den Boulevard'' in the local dialect. Tourist sights such as the Cathedral are located here, but also more mundane places.

Quarters in the inner city are:

* Historical centre
* Meir
* Schipperskwartier
* Quartier Latin
* University quarter
* het Zuid
* nieuw Zuid

Antwerpen-Noord or synonymously 2060 is a densely populated part of the city, and the most diverse one as well.

* Seefhoek
* Stuivenberg
* Amandus-Atheneum
* Dam

==== Antwerpen intra-muros - 2018 ====
This is not a neighborhood by itself, but is the postal code for the remaining quarters of the district that lie between ''de Leien'' and the ringway.

* Statiekwartier
* Diamond square
* Groen Kwartier
* Haringrode
* Zurenborg
* Brederode
* Klein-Antwerpen

==== Antwerpen 2030 ====

* Luchtbal
* Not a quarter, but a significant amount of territory here are industrial and uninhabited port terrains.

==== Linkeroever - 2050 ====
United with the city in 1923, Linkeroever ("Left bank") consists of the former polders of [[Zwijndrecht, Belgium|Zwijndrecht]] and [[Burcht, Antwerp|Burcht]].

==== Berchem - 2600 ====
[[Berchem|Antwerp-Berchem]]: Vibrant district, rich history, lively streets, major transportation hub.

==Cityscape and architecture==
Antwerp's architecture is a blend of old and new, with a cultural heritage spanning from the Gothic and Renaissance periods to contemporary designs. In the 16th century, the city was noted for the wealth of its citizens ({{lang|la|Antwerpia nummis}}).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the [[Hanseatic League]] on the northern quays, in 1891. During [[World War II]], the city also suffered considerable damage from [[Vergeltungswaffe|V-bombs]]. Here are some of the most notable examples of Antwerp's diverse architecture:

* [[Port Authority Building (Antwerp)|The Port House]], designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], is a contemporary landmark that juxtaposes a restored neoclassical building with a futuristic glass-clad extension.
* The Provincial Government Building, designed by [[Xaveer De Geyter]] Architects, is a unique triangular-shaped building with a natural stone façade located in the historic city center.
* [[DeSingel|De Singel]], a cultural center with a modernist design, features a mix of glass and concrete and is considered an architectural marvel.
* [[Palace of Justice Antwerp|The Palace of Justice]], designed by [[Richard Rogers]]', is a modern building with a prominent dome and makes extensive use of glass and steel.
* The [[Museum aan de Stroom|MAS Museum]], with its distinctive red sandstone façade, is a contemporary building that explores Antwerp's rich maritime history.
* The [[Zurenborg]] neighborhood is known for its Art Nouveau architecture, featuring intricate details, colorful mosaics, and stained glass windows.
* [[Maison Guiette]] is a residential building designed by the Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]] in collaboration with the Belgian architect Paul De Meyer in 1926-1927. Maison Guiette is considered an early example of Le Corbusier's work in Europe. It is now listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and is recognized as an important example of modernist architecture.
* De [[Boerentoren]], or "The Farmer's Tower", is a historic Art Deco skyscraper that was once the tallest building in Europe.
* The [[Bourla Theatre]], with its Neo-Classical style, is a historic theater that dates back to the 19th century.
* The [[Hendrik Conscience Heritage Library]] is a historic library. The library was established in 1481 and is one of the oldest and most extensive heritage libraries in Belgium. It is home to over 1.5 million books, manuscripts, and other documents related to the history and culture of Flanders.
* The [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp|Royal Museum of Fine Arts]], with its Neo-Classical style, houses a vast collection of Flemish art from the 14th to the 20th century.
* [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station|Antwerp Central Station]], a beautiful Beaux-Arts railway station, is one of the most impressive examples of railway architecture in Europe.
* The Sint-Annatunnel,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Underpass|url=https://visit.antwerpen.be/the-underpass|access-date=2023-04-13|website=Visit Antwerpen|language=en|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326033023/https://visit.antwerpen.be/the-underpass|url-status=live}}</ref> also known as the Voetgangerstunnel, is a 572-meter-long tunnel. It was opened in 1933 and was designed by engineer [[Émile Van Averbeke|Emiel Van Averbeke]]. The tunnel connects the banks of the Scheldt River, linking the historic city center with the Left Bank neighborhood. It is primarily made of reinforced concrete and features an Art Deco style interior design with ceramic tiles, ornamental lighting fixtures, and decorative panels. One of its unique features is the wooden escalator, which has been in operation since the tunnel's opening. Today, the Voetgangerstunnel is a popular tourist attraction and a key transportation link for commuters and visitors to Antwerp.
* Nieuw Zuid (New South) neighborhood,  Located next to the river on the site of abandoned railway tracks, Nieuw Zuid is being designed as a sustainable green neighbourhood. The project, which will not be finished until 2030, includes buildings by acclaimed international architects such as [[Max Dudler]], [[Stefano Boeri]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Shigeru Ban]] and [[Kazuyo Sejima]].

Antwerp is also home to a wealth of historic Gothic, Baroque and Renaissance-style buildings, such as the [[Antwerp City Hall]], the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]], the [[St. James' Church, Antwerp|St. James' Church]], the [[Vleeshuis|Vleeshuis Museum]] and the [[St. Charles Borromeo Church, Antwerp|St. Charles Borromeo Church]].

==Parks and recreational areas==
Antwerp offers a diverse range of parks and recreational areas for locals and tourists to explore. One of the most popular attractions is the [[Antwerp Zoo]]. It opened on 21 July 1843, making it one of the oldest and most famous zoos in the world. The zoo covers an area of 10 hectares and is home to more than 5,000 animals from over 950 species. The zoo is located right next to [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station|Antwerp Central Station]] on the Koningin Astridplein. Antwerp Zoo has played its role in preservation and breeding programmes for several endangered species, including the okapi, the Przewalski horse, the Congo peafowl, the bonobo, the golden-headed lion tamarin, the European otter, and the Knysna seahorse. They take part in the [[EAZA Ex-situ Programme|European Endangered Species Programme]]. On 1 January 1983 the entire park (architecture and garden) was listed as a monument. Other well-known parks include:

* [[Nachtegalen Park]] with several adjacent parks south of Antwerp. The area is 90 hectares in total. The parks were all built around a castle and were acquired by the municipality of Antwerp in 1910. The parks consist of Den Brandt (21 ha), Vogelenzang (40 ha), and [[Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum|Middelheim Park]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Middelheim Museum|url=https://visit.antwerpen.be/info/middelheim-museum-en|access-date=2023-04-13|website=Visit Antwerpen|language=en|archive-date=13 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413222915/https://visit.antwerpen.be/info/middelheim-museum-en|url-status=live}}</ref> (24 ha) which is famous for its open-air sculpture museum that features over 400 works of art.

==Climate==
Antwerp has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), with cool winters, warm summers and frequent, though light, precipitation throughout the year. Due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]], Antwerp has a relatively mild climate throughout the year, with the average temperature fluctuating between {{cvt|4|C}} and {{cvt|19|C}} throughout the year.

==Fortifications==
{{Main|Fortifications of Antwerp}}
[[File:0 Het Steen - Antwerpen (1).JPG|thumb|right|''Het Steen'' (literally: 'The Stone')]]
Although Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former [[enceinte]], only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the [[Vleeshuis]] museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. ''[[Het Steen|Steen]]'' castle on the Scheldt-quai is the gate wing of the demolished castle of the Dukes of Brabant. It was partly reconstructed in the 19th century.

Antwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:
* 10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch
* 12th and 13th century: canals (so called "vlieten" and "ruien") were made
* 16th century: Spanish fortifications
* 19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications
* 20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts

====Jewish community====
[[File:Antwerpen Synagoge Bouwmeestersstraat2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Hollandse Synagoge]]]]

{{Main|Jewish Community of Antwerp}}After [[the Holocaust]] and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews, many of them [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]], live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff (formerly by Chief Rabbi [[Chaim Kreiswirth]]) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include [[Pshevorsk (Hasidic dynasty)|Pshevorsk]], based in Antwerp, as well as branches of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Skver (Hasidic dynasty)|Skver]], [[Klausenburg (Hasidic dynasty)|Klausenburg]], [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]] and several others. Rabbi [[Chaim Kreiswirth]], chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

According to the [[American Association of Port Authorities]], the [[port of Antwerp]] was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to [[Port of Rotterdam|Rotterdam]] in Europe. It handled 235.2&nbsp;million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive [[cargo|general]] and [[Heavy lift|project cargo]], as well as [[bulk cargo]]. Antwerp's docklands, with five [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], are home to a massive concentration of [[petrochemical]] industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. <ref>https://www.cciantwerp.com/industry/</ref> [[Electricity generation]] is also an important activity, with four [[nuclear power]] plants at [[Doel]], a [[Fossil-fuel power plant|conventional power station]] in Kallo, as well as several smaller [[combined cycle]] plants. There is a [[wind farm]] in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014–2020.<ref name="sustainableportofantwerp">{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainableportofantwerp.com/en/content/people/wind-farm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430023952/http://www.sustainableportofantwerp.com/en/content/people/wind-farm|archive-date=30 April 2014|url-status=dead|title=Wind farm &#124; Sustainable Port of Antwerp|access-date=2 August 2015}}</ref> The old Belgian [[bluestone]] [[quay]]s bordering the [[Scheldt]] for a distance of {{cvt|5.6|km}} to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by [[cruise ship]]s and [[short sea shipping]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Diamonds===
Antwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the [[Antwerp diamond district|diamond district]].<ref name=NYT11512>{{cite news|title=An Industry Struggles to Keep Its Luster|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/world/europe/antwerps-diamond-industry-tries-to-keep-its-luster.html|access-date=6 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 November 2012|author=John Tagliabue|archive-date=6 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006181846/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/world/europe/antwerps-diamond-industry-tries-to-keep-its-luster.html/|url-status=live}}</ref> 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://businessinantwerp.eu/sectors/diamond|title=Diamond|website=Business in Antwerp|access-date=26 April 2019|archive-date=25 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425031154/https://businessinantwerp.eu/sectors/diamond|url-status=live}}</ref> and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2012/11/06/An-Industry-Struggles-to-Keep-Its-Luster/stories/201211060199|title=An Industry Struggles to Keep Its Luster|last=Tagliabue|first=John|year=2012|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=24 April 2019|archive-date=26 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126234214/https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2012/11/06/An-Industry-Struggles-to-Keep-Its-Luster/stories/201211060199|url-status=live}}</ref> The city has four [[Diamond#Distribution|diamond bourse]]s: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the [[Antwerpsche Diamantkring]] and the Vrije Diamanthandel.<ref name="awdc">{{cite web|url=https://www.awdc.be/en/industry|title=The industry &#124; Antwerp World Diamond Centre|publisher=awdc.be|access-date=2 August 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626114400/https://www.awdc.be/en/industry|archive-date=26 June 2015}}</ref> Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century,<ref name=":0" /> with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584.

==Transportation==

===Rail===
Antwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international and [[Thalys]] trains to [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Paris]], and national trains to [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]], [[Ostend]], [[Brussels]], [[Charleroi]], [[Hasselt]], [[Liège]], [[Leuven]] and [[Turnhout]]. [[Antwerpen-Central railway station|Antwerp Central station]] is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in [[W. G. Sebald|W G Sebald]]'s novel [[Austerlitz (novel)|''Austerlitz'']]. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, {{cvt|2|km|0|abbr=off}} to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.

Antwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest [[classification yard]] for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.

===Local public transport===
The city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by [[De Lijn]] and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The [[Antwerp Tram|tram network]] has 14 lines, of which the underground section is called the "[[Antwerp Pre-metro|premetro]]" and includes a tunnel under the river. The [[Franklin Rooseveltplaats]] functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines. However, there has been an evolution to end regional lines at transportation hubs more outward of the city center, such as Zuid and Luchtbal.

}}

===Road===
A six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the "Ring" it offers motorway connections to [[Brussels]], [[Hasselt]] and [[Liège]], [[Ghent]], [[Lille]] and [[Bruges]] and [[Breda]] and [[Bergen op Zoom]] (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the [[Kennedytunnel|Kennedy Tunnel]] (1967) and the [[Liefkenshoektunnel|Liefkenshoek Tunnel]] (1991).

Daily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the "[[Oosterweelconnection]]" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the ''Lange Wapper'') over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In September 2010 the [[Flemish Government]] decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, [[Hamburg]], [[Madrid]] and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2017 it was finally decided to complete the ringway of Antwerp with a new tunnel crossing the Scheldt. In a compromise with civil society, it has equally been decided that the ringway will in the long term completely be covered. This compromise is called the ''Toekomstverbond''  ("Agreement for the future"). Part of the same agreement is that highways further away from the city center will be further developed and that the amount of motorized trips in all transportation should be reduced to 50%.

Many [[FlixBus]]<nowiki/>es have a stop at the central Franklin Rooseveltplaats.

===Air===
[[File:Antwerp International Airport- Deurne Tower.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Control tower and terminal building at Antwerp International Airport|[[Antwerp International Airport]]]]

A small airport, [[Antwerp International Airport]], is located in the district of [[Deurne, Belgium|Deurne]]. The airport is mainly used for business travel. Flying Group, the largest business jet service in Benelux and France, has its headquarters there and several maintenance sheds and hangars for their private jets. There are also some regular scheduled flights by [[TUI fly Belgium|TUI fly]] with direct connectivity to Spain, Croatia, Italy, Austria and Morocco. [[Luxair]] will fly again to [[London City Airport|London City]] airport from 2023. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre. The runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.

Belgium's major international airport, [[Brussels Airport]], is about {{cvt|45|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new [[Diabolo project|''Diabolo'' rail connection]] provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.

There is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and [[Charleroi]] South station, with a connecting buslink to [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], which runs twice per hour on working days.

=== Water===
Since 2017 there has been a regular water ferry halting at the city center, connecting it with towns up and down the river Scheldt from [[Hemiksem|Kruibeke]] to Lillo. This service is called ''DeWaterbus''. It is popular with both commuting port laborers and cyclist making a day trip.

==Politics==

===City council===
The current city council was elected in the [[Belgian local elections, 2018|October 2018 elections]].

The current majority consists of N-VA, Vooruit and Open Vld, led by mayor [[Bart De Wever]] (N-VA).

In the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.
From 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Social Democrat]] party: [[Camille Huysmans]], [[Lode Craeybeckx]], Frans Detiège and [[Mathilde Schroyens]], and after the municipality fusion: {{Ill|Bob Cools|nl}}, [[Leona Detiège]] and [[Patrick Janssens]].
