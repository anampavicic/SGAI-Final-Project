Atlanta was originally founded as the [[Rail terminus|terminus]] of a major state-sponsored railroad, but it soon became the convergence point among several railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The largest was the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]], from which the name "Atlanta" is derived, signifying the city's growing reputation as a major hub of transportation.<ref name="NGEAtlanta" /> During the [[American Civil War]], it served a strategically important role for [[the Confederacy]] until it was captured in 1864.

===Western and Atlantic Railroad===
In 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] in order to provide a link between the port of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref name="W&ARR">{{cite web|title=Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad|work=About North Georgia|publisher=Golden Ink|url=http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html|access-date=November 12, 2007|archive-date=October 3, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003030525/http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The initial route was to run southward from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] to a terminus east of the [[Chattahoochee River]], which would be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the "zero milepost" was driven into the ground in what is now Foundry Street, [[Five Points, Atlanta|Five Points]]. When asked in 1837 about the future of the little village, [[Stephen Harriman Long]], the railroad's chief engineer said the place would be good "for one tavern, a blacksmith shop, a grocery store, and nothing else".<ref>{{Cite news|last=McQuigg|first=Jackson|date=January 9, 2022|title=Atlanta didn't build the railroad – The railroads built Atlanta|page=6|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}</ref> A year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as ''Terminus'', and later ''Thrasherville'', after a local merchant who built homes and a [[general store]] in the area.<ref name="ThrashervilleHistoricalMarker">{{cite web|title=Thrasherville|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/fulton/thrasherville|website=Georgia Info|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> By 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed ''[[Marthasville, Georgia|Marthasville]]'' to honor Governor [[Wilson Lumpkin|Wilson Lumpkin's]] daughter Martha.

In 1864, the [[Union Army]] moved southward following the capture of Chattanooga and began its [[Atlanta campaign|invasion of north Georgia]]. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army battles, culminating with the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and a four-month-long siege of the city by the Union Army under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. On September 1, 1864, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] decided to retreat from Atlanta, and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the Union Army. On the next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun (politician, born 1811)|James Calhoun]] surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, Sherman prepared for the Union Army's [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] by ordering the destruction of Atlanta's remaining military assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarlibrary.org/sherman-s-march-chronology.html|title=Sherman's March Chronology|website=civilwarlibrary.org}}</ref>

===Reconstruction and late 19th century===
[[File:Marietta-Street-Atlanta.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Marietta Street, 1864]]After the Civil War ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt during the [[Reconstruction era]]. The work attracted many new residents. Due to the city's superior [[rail transportation]] network, the [[List of U.S. state historical capitals|state capital]] was moved from [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] to Atlanta in 1868.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Edwin L.|title=The Story of Georgia's Capitols and Capital Cities|publisher=Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia|url=http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763|access-date=November 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009145856/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm|archive-date=October 9, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 1880 Census, Atlanta had surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city.<ref>{{cite web |title=1880 Census: Volume 1.

Beginning in the 1880s, [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the "[[New South]]" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now the [[History of Georgia Tech|Georgia Institute of Technology]]) and the [[Atlanta University Center]], a consortium of [[historically black colleges|historically Black colleges]] made up of units for men and women, had established Atlanta as a center for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]], which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South's development to the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/06/08/102515577.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/06/08/102515577.pdf |archive-date=October 9, 2022 |url-status=live|title=The South: Vast Resources, Rapid Development, Wonderful Opportunities for Capital and Labor&nbsp;...|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 8, 1895}}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]

During the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs. The city's skyline grew taller with the construction of the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable]], [[Flatiron Building (Atlanta)|Flatiron]], [[J. Mack Robinson College of Business Administration Building|Empire]], and [[Candler Building (Atlanta)|Candler]] buildings. [[Sweet Auburn]] emerged as a center of Black commerce. The period was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906, when Whites attacked Blacks, leaving at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured, with extensive damage in Black neighborhoods. In 1913, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish-American factory superintendent, was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial. He was sentenced to death but the governor commuted his sentence to life. An enraged and organized [[Lynching|lynch mob]] took him from jail in 1915 and hanged him in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]. The Jewish community in Atlanta and across the country were horrified.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jewish Community of Atlanta|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/atlanta|website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project|publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot|access-date=July 19, 2018|archive-date=July 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718174348/https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/atlanta|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Teachinghistory.org|url=https://teachinghistory.org/history-content/beyond-the-textbook/25059|access-date=January 6, 2022|website=teachinghistory.org}}</ref> On May 21, 1917, the [[Great Atlanta Fire of 1917|Great Atlanta Fire]] destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the [[Old Fourth Ward]], resulting in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people.<ref name=NGEAtlanta/>

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the [[premiere]] of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's [[Margaret Mitchell]]. The gala event at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]] was attended by the film's legendary producer, [[David O. Selznick]], and the film's stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], and [[Olivia de Havilland]], but Oscar winner [[Hattie McDaniel]], an African-American actress, was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind|title=Atlanta Premiere of Gone with the Wind|publisher=Ngeorgia.com|access-date=April 5, 2010|archive-date=January 15, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115033241/http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during [[World War II]] due to the city's war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network and military bases. The defense industries attracted thousands of new residents and generated revenues, resulting in rapid population and economic growth. In the 1950s, the city's newly constructed highway system, supported by federal subsidies, allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population.<ref name=NGEAtlanta/>

===Civil rights movement===
[[File:Martin Luther King Jr Coretta Scott King Tomb.jpg|thumb|The [[sarcophagus]] for Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King is within the [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park]] in Atlanta proper.]]

African-American veterans returned from World War II seeking full rights in their country and began heightened activism. In exchange for support by that portion of the Black community that could vote, in 1948 the mayor ordered the hiring of the first eight African-American police officers in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=admin |date=February 7, 2021 |title=The "YMCA" Cops |url=https://nleomf.org/the-ymca-cops/ |access-date=April 6, 2024 |website=National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund |language=en-US}}</ref>

Atlanta was selected as the site for the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]]. Following the [[Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics|announcement]], the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve Atlanta's parks, sporting venues, and transportation infrastructure; however, for the first time, none of the $1.7&nbsp;billion cost of the games was governmentally funded.

During the 2000s, the city of Atlanta underwent a profound physical, [[human culture|cultural]], and [[demographics|demographic]] change. As some of the African-American middle and upper classes also began to move to the suburbs, a booming economy drew numerous new migrants from other cities in the United States, who contributed to changes in the city's demographics.

Most of Atlanta was burned in the final months of the American Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been traditionally "southern": Atlanta originated as a railroad town rather than a southern seaport dominated by the planter class, such as [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] or  [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Because of its later development, many of the city's landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the Northeast or Midwest, as they were designed at a time of shared national architectural styles.<ref name="Gournay">{{cite book|title=AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta|last=Gournay|first=Isabelle|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn = 0820314501|year = 1993}}</ref>
[[File:Atlanta Skyline - Piedmont Park.png|thumb|The skyline of Midtown (viewed from [[Piedmont Park]]) emerged with the construction of modernist [[Colony Square]] in 1972.]]
During the late 20th century, Atlanta embraced the global trend of [[modern architecture]], especially for commercial and institutional structures. Examples include the [[State of Georgia Building]] built in 1966, and the [[Georgia-Pacific Tower]] in 1982. Many of the most notable examples from this period were designed by world renowned Atlanta architect [[John C. Portman Jr.|John Portman]]. Most of the buildings that define the downtown skyline were designed by Portman during this period, including the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza]] and the [[Atlanta Marriott Marquis]]. In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of the early homes of postmodern buildings that reintroduced classical elements to their designs. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in this period and style, displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as [[One Atlantic Center]] (1987), [[191 Peachtree Tower]] (1991), and the [[Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta]] (1992). Also completed during the era is the Portman-designed [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]] built in 1992. At {{convert|1023|ft|m|0}}, it is the tallest building in the city and the 14th-tallest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001338.html|title=World's Tallest Buildings|website=Infoplease.com |access-date=June 26, 2007}}</ref>

Gentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta. The [[gentrification of Atlanta]] has its origins in the 1970s, after many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had declined and suffered the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through the city's east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's [[gentrification]]. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, gentrification expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. New development post-2000 has been aided by the [[Atlanta Housing Authority]]'s eradication of the city's public housing. As noted above, it allowed development of these sites for mixed-income housing, requiring developers to reserve a considerable portion for affordable housing units. It has also provided for other former residents to be given vouchers to gain housing in other areas.<ref name="husock">{{cite web|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_4_atlanta-public-housing.html |title=Atlanta's Public-Housing Revolution |last=Husock |first=Howard |work=City Journal |date=Autumn 2010|access-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref> Construction of the Beltline has stimulated new and related development along its path.<ref>{{cite news|last=Powers |first=Benjamin |url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/11/putting-the-brakes-on-runaway-gentrification-in-atlanta/545555/ |title=Putting the Brakes on Runaway Gentrification in Atlanta |work=[[CityLab (web magazine)|CityLab]] |date=November 10, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref>

Atlanta has played a major or contributing role in the development of various genres of American music at different points in the city's history. Beginning as early as the 1920s, Atlanta emerged as a center for [[country music]], which was brought to the city by migrants from [[Appalachia]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Wayne W.

The city was also a center for [[Southern rock]] during its 1970s heyday: the [[Allman Brothers Band]]'s hit instrumental "[[Hot 'Lanta]]" is an ode to the city, while [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s famous live rendition of "[[Free Bird]]" was recorded at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] in 1976, with lead singer [[Ronnie Van Zant]] directing the band to "play it pretty for Atlanta".<ref>{{cite news |title=Rock's Top Southern Sound Viewed as Lynyrd Skynyrd |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7MtVAAAAIBAJ&pg=6799%2C459278 |newspaper=The Robesonian |location=Lumberton, N.C. |date=November 7, 1976 |access-date=October 28, 2014}}</ref> During the 1980s, Atlanta had an active [[punk rock]] scene centered on two of the city's music venues, [[688 Club]] and the Metroplex, and Atlanta famously played host to the [[Sex Pistols]]' first U.S. show, which was performed at the Great Southeastern Music Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://creativeloafing.com/content-165784-atlanta-punk-a-reunion-for-688-and |title= Atlanta punk!

The 1990s saw the city produce major mainstream acts across many different musical genres. Country music artist [[Travis Tritt]], and R&B sensations [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]], [[TLC (group)|TLC]], [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] and [[Toni Braxton]], were just some of the musicians who call Atlanta home. The city also gave birth to [[Atlanta hip hop]], a sub-genre that gained relevance and success with the introduction of the home-grown Atlantans known as [[Outkast]], along with other [[Dungeon Family]] artists such as [[Organized Noize]] and [[Goodie Mob]]; however, it was not until the 2000s that Atlanta moved "from the margins to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity with another sub-genre called [[Crunk]], part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South and East".<ref name="nyt">{{Cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|date=December 11, 2009|title=Gucci Mane, No Holds Barred|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/arts/music/13gucci.html|access-date=January 6, 2022|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlantamagazine.com/list/20-reasons-why-atlanta-americas-music-capital/we-are-trap/|title=20 Reasons Why Atlanta is America's Music Capital|page=1|website=[[Atlanta (magazine)|Atlanta]]|date=May 11, 2018|access-date=November 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/remember-chainz-pink-trap-house-going-torn-down/q5K56M1MdI4L7W9Y3LCGSK/|title=Remember 2 Chainz's Pink Trap House?
