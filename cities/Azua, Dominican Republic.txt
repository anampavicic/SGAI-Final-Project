'''Azua de Compostela''', also known simply as '''Azua''', is a city, [[Municipalities of the Dominican Republic|municipality]] (''[[municipio]]'') and capital of [[Azua Province]] in the southern region of [[Dominican Republic]]. Founded in 1504, Azua is one of the oldest European settlements in the Americas. The town is located 100 kilometres west of the national capital, [[Santo Domingo]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-03-05 |title=Relation: Azua (7391027) |url=https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7391027 |access-date=2024-03-29 |website=OpenStreetMap |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
The territory was part of the chiefdom of Maguana, one of the five [[Taino]] chiefdoms in the island. [[Christopher Columbus]] encountered great difficulties that forced him and his companions to take refuge in the Bay of [[San José de Ocoa|Ocoa]], in the eastern part of the Azua territory. There he met the resistance of the Great ([[Cacique]]) of Azua Cuyocagua, whom the Admiral tried to subdue without success.

The town of Azúa de Compostela was officially founded in 1504 by [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] (conqueror of Cuba), during the government of Don [[Nicolás de Ovando]]. The famous conqueror of Mexico [[Hernán Cortés]] also resided in the town for several years (1504–1511). During his stay in Azua he used to spend his hours of leisure on the Monte Río beach.

==Economy==
[[File:Azua Dominican Republic city people.jpg|thumb|right|Azua, Dominican Republic people.]]
Azua has an active population (of working age) of 23,242 people of which 16,167 work, 69% of the economically active population. Of those who work, 20% are [[public servants]] (3,232 people). Most of the area of the municipality is concentrated in medium-sized properties, in which combined technology is used, with a predominance of [[mechanization]]. Large properties, with more than 800 tasks (one task = 628.83 m<sup>2</sup>), are in the hands of a few large producers.

The municipality has been one of the most benefited with the installation of agro-industrial companies covered by Law 409, which has stimulated the development of the public and private financial sector.

==Population==
[[File:Ayuntamiento Azua.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Azua, Dominican Republic town hall.]]
As of the Dominican Republic's 2012 [[census]], the municipality had a total population of 128,264 inhabitants, of which 92,585 lived in urban areas and 35,679 in rural areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Estadística (ONE) |first=Oficina Nacional de |title=Oficina Nacional de Estadística (ONE) |url=http://one.gob.do/ |access-date=2024-03-29 |website=Oficina Nacional de Estadística (ONE)}}</ref>
