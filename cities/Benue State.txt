Benue State is a legacy of an administrative entity that was carved out of the protectorate of [[northern Nigeria]] at the beginning of the twentieth century. The territory was initially known as Munshi Province until 1918 when the name of its dominant geographical feature, the [[Benue River]] was adopted.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Benue {{!}} Nigeria|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Benue|access-date=15 June 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Benue State is named after the [[Benue River]] and was formed from the former [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1976, along with [[Igala people|Igala]] and some part of [[Kwara State]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://benuestate.gov.ng/historical-background/|title=Historical Background|date=1 November 2017|website=Government of Benue State|language=en-US|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> In 1991, some areas of Benue state (mostly the [[Igala people|Igala]]-speaking area), along with areas in [[Kwara State]], were clubbed together to form the new [[Kogi State]]. [[Igbo people]] are found in the boundary areas like the [[Obi, Nigeria|Obi]], [[Oju, Nigeria|Oju]] and Ado Local Government Areas. It is known as the "Heartbeat of the Middle Belt" and the "Entertainment Capital of the [[Middle Belt]]" north of the [[Niger River]]. [[Otukpo]], the [[Idoma people|Idoma]] people's traditional and administrative capital, is also known as the Lion's Heart and the Land of the Brave.<ref>{{Cite web|date=28 January 2018|title=Idoma International Carnival gradually revving into cultural hub|url=https://t.guardian.ng/art/Idoma-international-carnival-gradually-revving-into-cultural-hub/|access-date=2 August 2021|website=The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News|language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==

===Population structure and distribution===

Benue State, which is located in the North Central region of [[Nigeria]], has a total population of 4,253,641 in the [[List of Nigerian states by population|2006 census]], with an average population density of 99 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. This makes Benue the 9th most populous state in Nigeria. However, the distribution of the population according to Local government areas shows marked duality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=National Population Commission|title=National Population Census Statistics|url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/download/474&ved=2ahUKEwi4laPT7931AhWlyoUKHc45B6sQFnoECBsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0BYliCMVsVxpAo4Ie9xgup|journal=National Population Commission}}</ref>

There are areas of low [[population]] density, such as [[Guma, Nigeria|Guma]], [[Ohimini]], Tarka, [[Apa, Nigeria|Apa]], [[Logo, Nigeria|Logo]] and [[Agatu]], each with less than seventy persons per km<sup>2</sup>, while [[Vandeikya]], Ukum, Kwande, Otukpo, [[Okpokwu]],  and [[Gboko]] have densities ranging from 160 persons to 200 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. Makurdi LGA has over 380 persons per km2. The males are 49.8 percent of the total population while females constitute 50.2 per cent.

===Settlement pattern and urbanization===

Benue State region was depleted of its human population during the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. It is largely rural, with scattered settlements mainly in tiny compounds or homesteads, whose population range from 630 people, most of whom are farmers.

Urbanization in Benue State did not predate the colonial era. The few towns established during colonial rule remained very small (less than 30,000 people) up to the creation of Benue State in 1976.

Benue towns can be categorised into three groups. The first group consists of those with a population of 80,000 to 500,000 people. These include [[Makurdi]], the State Capital, [[Gboko]] and [[Otukpo]] the "headquarters" of the two dominant ethnic groups (125,944 and 88,958 people respectively). The second group comprises towns with a population of between 20,000 and 50,000 people and includes [[Katsina-Ala]], [[Ukum|Zaki-Biam]], [[Vandeikya]] and [[Kwande|Adikpo]]. These are all local government headquarters. The third category comprises towns with a population of 10,000 to 19,000 people and includes, Lessel, [[Vandeikya|Ihugh]], [[Naka Benue Nigeria|Naka]], Adoka, Aliade, Okpoga, [[Igumale]], [[Oju, Nigeria|Oju]], Utonkon, Ugbokolo, Wannune, Ugbokpo, [[Otukpa]], [[Ugba]] and Korinya. Most of these towns are headquarters of recently created Local Government Areas and/or district headquarters or major market areas. Some of the headquarters of the newly created LGAs have populations of less than 10,000 people. Such places include Tse-Agberaba, Gbajimba, [[Buruku]], Idekpa, [[Obagaji]] and Obarikeito. Apart from earth roads, schools, periodic markets and chemists (local drug stores), the rural areas are largely used for farming, relying on the urban centres for most of their urban needs. Benue State has no problem of capital city primacy. Rather, three towns stand out very clearly as important urban centres which together account for more than 70 per cent of the social amenities provided in the state and almost all the industrial establishments. These centres are [[Makurdi]], [[Gboko]] and [[Otukpo]]. They are among the oldest towns in the state and are growing at a much faster rate than the smaller younger towns.

[[Makurdi]] doubles as the capital of the state and the headquarters of Makurdi LGA, while [[Gboko]], [[Otukpo]] and [[Oju, Nigeria|Oju]] double as the local government and ethnic headquarters (i.e. for [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Idoma people|Idoma]], and Igede). All the roads in the state radiate from these three centres.  As an administrative unit, Benue State was first created on 3 February 1976. It was one of the seven states created by the military administration headed by [[Murtala Mohammed|General Murtala Mohammed]], which increased the number of states in the country from 13 to 19. In 1991, its boundaries were re-adjusted with the creation of [[Kogi State]]. The new Benue State of today has twenty-three (23) local government areas,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Benue State Local Government Areas – I am Benue |url=http://www.iambenue.com/benue-state/local-governments-areas/ |access-date=5 September 2022 |language=en-GB}}</ref> which are administered by local government councils.

== Geography ==
[[File:Mkar Hill.jpg|thumb|Mkar Hill]]
[[Benue State]] lies within the lower [[Benue River|river Benue]] trough in the middle belt region of Nigeria. Its geographic coordinates are longitude 7° 47' and 10° 0' East. Latitude 6° 25' and 8° 8' North; and shares boundaries with five other states namely: [[Nasarawa State]] to the north for 231&nbsp;km (partly across the Benue River), [[Taraba State]] to the east for 235&nbsp;km, [[Cross River State|Cross-River State]] to the south for 96&nbsp;km, [[Enugu State]] to the south-west for 84&nbsp;km, and [[Kogi State]] to the west for 153&nbsp;km. The state also shares a common boundary for 22&nbsp;km with the [[Nord-Ouest Province, Cameroon|Nord-Ouest Province]], claimed by both [[Ambazonia]] and the [[Cameroon|Republic of Cameroon]] on the south-east. Benue occupies a landmass of 34,059 square kilometres.

=== Climate ===
Benue state has a Tropical wet and dry or [[Savanna|savanna climate]]. The city's yearly temperature is 29.38&nbsp;°C (84.88&nbsp;°F) and it is −0.08% lower than Nigeria's averages. The state receives about 135.2 millimeters (5.32 inches) of [[precipitation]] and has 160.01 rainy days (43.84% of the time) annually.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Benue, NG Climate Zone, Monthly Weather Averages and Historical Data |url=https://tcktcktck.org/nigeria/benue |access-date=30 June 2023 |website=tcktcktck.org}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Climate Benue: Temperature, climate graph, Climate table for Benue |url=https://en.climate-data.org/africa/nigeria/benue-351/ |access-date=26 August 2023 |website=en.climate-data.org}}</ref>

===Geology===
Based on [[Köppen climate classification]], Benue State lies within the [[Tropical savanna climate|AW climate]] and experiences two distinct seasons, the [[Wet season]] and the [[Dry season]]. The rainy season lasts from April to October with annual rainfall in the range of 100-200mm. The [[dry season]] begins in November and ends in March. [[Temperature]]s fluctuate between 21 – 37 degrees Celsius in the year. The south-eastern part of the state adjoining the Obudu-Cameroun mountain range, however, has a cooler climate similar to that of [[Plateau State]].<ref name=":1" />

Much of Benue State falls within the Benue Valley/trough which is believed to be structurally developed. During the Tertiary and possibly the [[Interglacial]] periods of the [[Quaternary glaciation]], the Benue and Niger Valleys, otherwise known as the Niger/Benue trough, were transgressed by the waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As a result, marine sediments form the dominant surface geology of much of Benue State.

===Mineral resources===
Benue State is blessed with abundant mineral resources. These resources are distributed in the Local Government Areas of the state. Of these mineral resources, only [[Limestone]] at [[Tse-Kucha]] near [[Gboko]] and [[Kaolinite]] at [[Otukpo]] are being commercially exploited. Other mineral deposits include [[Baryte]], [[Gypsum]], [[Feldspar]], [[Wolframite]], [[Kaolinite]], mineral salts and [[Gemstone]] etc.

===Agriculture===
[[Agriculture]] is the mainstay of the economy of Benue State, engaging over 75% of the state's workforce. Prominent crops include [[Yam (vegetable)|Yam]], Rice, [[Bean]]s, [[Cassava]], [[Sweet potato]], Maize, [[Soybean]], [[Sorghum]], [[Millet]], [[Sesame]], [[Cocoyam]] etc. The state also accounts for over 70% of Nigeria's [[Soybean]] production.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Akinfolarin |first=Ayo |date=30 May 2023 |title=Soybeans Producing States in Nigeria |url=https://veggiegrow.ng/soybeans-producing-states-in-nigeria/ |access-date=11 July 2024 |website=Veggie Grow |language=en-US}}</ref>

The vegetation of the southern parts of the state is characterised by forests, which yield trees for timber and provide a suitable habitat for rare animals types and species. The state thus possesses potential for the development of viable forest and wildlife reserves.

===Relief and drainage===
The land is generally low lying (averaging 100m-250m) and gently undulating with occasional [[List of inselbergs|inselbergs]], [[Hillock|Knoll]], [[Laterite]] etc. It is only at the boundary area with [[Cameroon]], also [[Kwande]] and [[Oju, Nigeria|Oju]] Local Government Areas that hilly terrain with appreciable local relief is encountered. Here, the terrain is characterised by steep slopes, deep incised [[valleys]] and generally rugged relief. Elsewhere, gradients average less than 4°. [[River Benue]] is the dominant geographical feature in the state. It is one of the few large rivers in Nigeria. The [[Katsina-Ala]] is the largest tributary, while the smaller rivers include [[Mkomon]], [[Amile]], [[Duru]], [[Loko Konshisha]], [[Kpa River|Kpa]], [[Okpokwu]], [[Mu River (Nigeria)|Mu]], [[Be River (Nigeria)|Be]], [[Aya River|Aya]], [[Apa Ogede]] and [[Ombi]]. The flood plains which are characterised by extensive swamps and ponds are good for dry season irrigated farming.

Though Benue State has high drainage density many of the streams are seasonal. Hence, there is an acute water shortage in the dry season in Local Government Areas such as [[Guma, Nigeria|Guma]], [[Okpokwu]], [[Ogbadibo]], [[Gwer West]] ([[Naka, Benue Nigeria|Naka, Nigeria]]) and [[Oju, Nigeria|Oju]]. This river system has great potential for a viable fishing industry, dry season farming through irrigation and for an inland water highway.

==People and culture==

The state is populated by several ethnic groups: [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Idoma people|Idoma]], [[Igede language|Igede]], [[Etulo language|Etulo]], Ufia [[Korring|Orring]], Abakpa, [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Akweya]] and [[Nyifon]]. The [[Tiv people|Tiv]] are occupying 14 local government areas with the Etulo and Jukun, with the [[Idoma people|Idoma]], [[Korring|Orring]], [[Igede language|Igede]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Akweya]] and [[Nyifon]] occupying nine.

Most of the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] people are farmers while the inhabitants of the river areas engage in fishing as their primary or important secondary occupation. The people of the state are famous for their cheerful and hospitable disposition as well as rich cultural heritage.

===Traditional rulers===
The Benue State Government accords high respect to traditional rulers in recognition of their role as custodians of culture and as agents of development. Also, their roles in enhancing peace and order at the grassroots level are also recognised. To enhance their contribution to the affairs of the state, government has established a three-tier traditional council system made up of Local Government Area Traditional Councils, Area Traditional Councils and the State Council of Chiefs with the Tor Tiv (Tiv King) as chairman.

The two Area Councils are the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] Traditional Council and the [[Idoma people|Idoma]] Traditional Council.  The former has the Tor Tiv (Tiv King) as chairman of all the traditional rulers from the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] dominant Local Government Areas, while the latter has the Och' Idoma ([[Idoma people|Idoma]] king) as the chairman of all the traditional rulers from the [[Idoma people|Idoma]] dominant Local Government Areas.

The State Council of Chiefs has the Tor Tiv, Orchivirigh Professor [[James Ortese Iorzua Ayatse]] (Tor Tiv V) (<ref>{{cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/sunday-magazine/new-dawn-as-tiv-land-crowns-professor-james-ortese-iorzua-ayatse-king/|title=New dawn, as Tiv land crowns Professor James Ortese Iorzua Ayatse King|first=Joseph|last=Wantu|newspaper=The Guardian – Sunday Magazine|date=5 March 2017|access-date=15 June 2021}}</ref>), with Och'Idoma and all second class Chiefs/Chairmen of the Local Government Traditional Council as members.

===Culture===
[[File:Benue state contingent 2.jpg|thumb|Dancers in Benue state attire]]
[[File:Benue state contingent 1.jpg|thumb|Benue state contingent]]
Benue State possesses a rich and diverse cultural heritage which finds expression in colourful cloths, exotic masquerades, supplicated music and dances. Traditional dances from Benue State have won acclaim at national and international cultural festivals. The most popular of these dances include [[Ingyough]], [[Ange (band)|Ange]], [[Anchanakupa]], [[Swange]] and [[Ogirinya]] among others.

The socio-religious festivals of the people, colourful dances, dresses and songs are also of tourist value. The Alekwu ancestral festival of the Idoma people, for instance, is an occasion when the local people believe their ancestors re-established contact with the living in the form of masquerades.

The [[Igede Agba]] is a Yam Festival, marked every year in September by the Igede people of [[Oju, Nigeria|Oju]] and [[Obi, Nigeria|Obi]] local government areas. Among the Tiv, the Tiv Day, marriage ceremonies and dance competitions (e.g. Swange dance) are often very colourful. [[Kwagh-Hir]] is a very entertaining Tiv puppet show.

Social life in Benue State is also enriched by the availability of diverse recreational facilities. Apart from parks, beaches, dancing and masquerades mentioned above, the big hotels in [[Makurdi]], [[Gboko]] and [[Otukpo]] are equipped with several indoor sporting facilities. There are golf clubs, the Makurdi Club, Railway Club, Police Club and Air Force Club, where, apart from the sale of drinks and snacks, various types of games are played.

There is a standard Arts Theatre, a modern Sports Complex which includes the [[Aper Aku Stadium]], which has provisions for such games as tennis, basketball, volleyball and handball, an indoor sports hall and Olympic size swimming pool in Makurdi. Smaller stadia exist in [[Gboko]] (J. S. Tarka Stadium), [[Katsina-Ala]], [[Adikpo]], [[Vandeikya]] and [[Otukpo]]. The BCC Lawn Tennis tournament attracts players from all over the country. Benue State has three teams in the professional soccer ranks, [[Lobi Stars F.C.]] in Division One, [[BCC Lions FC]] in Division Two, Mark mentors as the basketball premier league team.

=== Makurdi ===
Makurdi, the state capital was established in the early twenties and gained prominence in 1927 when it became the headquarters of the then Benue Province.  Being a river port, it attracted the establishment of trading depots by companies such as [[United Africa Company of Nigeria]] and [[John Holt plc]].  Its commercial status was further enhanced when the Railway Bridge was completed and opened in 1932.  In 1976, the town became the capital of Benue State and today, doubles as the headquarters of Makurdi Local Government Area.[[File:River Benue (in Makurdi With both Bridges).jpg|thumb|Makurdi]]The town is divided by the River Benue into the north and south banks, which are connected by two bridges: [[Old Bridge, Makurdi|the railway bridge]], which was built in 1932, and the new dual carriage bridge commissioned in 1978.

The southern part of the town is made up of several wards, including Central Ward, Old GRA, Ankpa Ward, Wadata Ward, High Level, Wurukum (Low Level), New GRA etc.  Important establishments and offices located here include the Government House, The State Secretariat, The Federal Secretariat, The Central Bank of Nigeria Regional headquarters, Commercial Banks, Telecommunication companies, Police Headquarters, Nigeria Prisons Service, [[Aper Aku Stadium]], Nigeria Air force Base, Makurdi, The Makurdi Modern Market, the Federal Medical Centre, Nigeria Railway Station, Benue Printing and Publishing Company Limited, Radio Benue, [[Nigerian Television Authority]] (NTA), Nigerian Postal service, Benue Hotels Makurdi, Benue Plaza hotel, Benue State University, Benue State Breweries.

The North bank area of the town houses among other establishments, the Federal University of Agriculture, the Nigerian Army School of Military Engineering, the headquarters of the 72 Airborne Battalion, Akawe Torkula Polytechnic (ATP) and the State Headquarters of the Department of Customs and Excise.

Owing to its location in the valley of River Benue, Makurdi experiences warm temperatures most of the year.  The period from November to January, when the harmattan weather is experienced is, however, relatively cool.

Makurdi can be reached by air,<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 January 2019 |title=Makurdi airport now ready for civil aviation operation — CAS |url=https://www.sunnewsonline.com/makurdi-airport-now-ready-for-civil-aviation-operation-cas/ |access-date=13 June 2021 |website=The Sun Nigeria |language=en-US}}</ref> rail, road and water as the airport is presently not functioning. The major northern route is the Makurdi – Lafia – Jos road.  The southern routes are Makurdi – Otukpo – Enugu and Makurdi – Yandev – Adikpo – Calabar roads.  Traffic from the west comes through Makurdi – (3) Naka – Adoka Ankpa (3) – Okene (1) roads and from the east through Makurdi – Yandev – Katsina Ala – Wukari roads.  The Makurdi Rail Bridge provides the only rail link between the northern and eastern parts of [[Nigeria]].

The beaches of River Benue can be exploited to provide good sites for relaxation.{{original research inline|date=January 2019}} The river itself provides tourist opportunities for boating, angling and swimming.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Makurdi Moratorium that houses a variety of animals including some rare species also serves as another feature of tourist attraction.

==Economy==

===Agricultural production===
Agriculture forms the backbone of the Benue State economy, engaging more than 70 per cent of the working population. This has made Benue the major source of food production in the Nation. Experts say that it can still be developed because most of the modern techniques are not yet popular to majority of Nigerian farmers. Mechanization and plantation agriculture/agro-forestry are still at its infancy. Farm inputs such as fertilizers, improved seed, insecticides and other foreign methods are being increasingly used. However, cost and availability is still a challenge. Important cash crops include [[soybean]]s, rice, peanuts, [[mango|mango varieties]], [[citrus]], etc.

Other cash crops include [[palm oil]], melon, [[Dacryodes edulis|African pear]], [[chili pepper]], [[tomatoes]] etc. Food crops include [[Yam (vegetable)|Yam]], [[Cassava]], [[Sweet potato]], [[Bean]]s, Maize, [[Millet]], [[Guinea corn]], Vegetables etc. There is very little irrigation agriculture and techniques.

Animal production includes: Cattle, Pork, Poultry and Goat but no dairy and dairy products yet.

The Zaki Ibiam International Yam Market is the biggest market for a single product in Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web |title=In Zaki Biam, Nigeria's Largest Mono-Product Market |url=https://folio.ng/in-zaki-ibiam-nigerias-largest-mono-product-market/ |website=Folio Nigeria |date=25 June 2020 |access-date=17 August 2020}}</ref>

=== Commerce and industry ===
Banking services are available as all the banks in Nigeria have branches in the state, with the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] having its regional headquarters in Makurdi. Dangote Cement Company is a private company that operates within the state and provides a little employment to the people.

This is a rough estimated employment percentage in the state: 75% are farmers, 10% traders, 6% civil servants, 9% private.

Benue State has the capacity to support a wide range of industries using local agricultural and mineral resources although potentials are yet to be exploited. Private initiatives in commerce and industry, particularly by indigenes, is as also on a small scale and is limited to carpentry, shoe repairs and manufacturing, small scale rice mills, leather and plastic industries, weaving, printing, catering, block making, food processing, etc. Industry and commerce have been greatly retarded by the absence of capital funds, basic infrastructure and the frequent political changes.

===Infrastructure and transportation===
The location of Benue State in the centre of the country plus the presence of bridges on two large rivers, the [[Benue River]] and [[Katsina Ala River|Katsina-Ala River]], make the state a major cross-roads centre. The present government has shown commitment to the construction of roads within the state capital Makurdi and other major roads leading in and out of the state. The roads are in an excellent condition.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 October 2019|title=Benue State History, LGA and Senatorial Districts|url=https://www.aziza.com.ng/read/2019/10/benue-state-history-and-there-capital-in-nigeria/|access-date=8 February 2022|website=Aziza Goodnews|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Power supply===
Electricity challenges in Benue are no different from every other region in Nigeria. Places like Makurdi, Otukpo and Gboko, as some examples, enjoy at least 60% of power supply. However, private industries have other sources of power supply as a contingency.

===Telecommunications===
Benue has facilities for the GSM service companies operating in the Country. The state also has at least 7 radio stations (Radio Benue, Joy FM, Harvest FM, Ashiwave FM, Sun Rays FM, Brothers' FM and Speed FM) and 2 television stations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Benue State - NigRadio |url=https://nigradio.com/benue-state/ |access-date=11 July 2024 |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Tourism and recreation===
Benue State possesses immense tourism potentials which are yet to be exploited. Since some of the tourist attractions are best selected by the tourist, Benue State in her bid to develop tourism embarked on infrastructural development necessary for the overall well-being of the tourist. The options are still opened to foreign investors.

The programme of road development, hotels, postal, telephone and Email services, electricity, potable water, recreational facilities and the general hospitality of the people will eventually open up the state to tourists. An amusement park and Zoo have been developed at Makurdi. There is a wildlife park at lkwe where a conference hall and chalets have been built to serve tourists. Tourist attractions in the state may be grouped into natural scenic, historical monuments and festivals.

Natural Attractions in Benue State include hills and ranges such as Ikyogen, Abande, Ngokur, Mkar, Ushongo and Harga. There is a heavily wooded natural trench at Tse-Mker which is believed to be inhabited by dangerous creatures including Pythons. Gurgul is a waterfall on [[Katsina Ala River]]. The border stretch adjoining the [[Obudu Plateau|Obudu]]/[[South Cameroon Plateau]] ranges features forests, dissected hills, [[Dike (geology)|Dykes]], dozens of fast flowing streams and incised valleys. In the [[Dry season]], the water level in both the [[Benue River]] and [[Katsina Ala River|Katsina-Ala River]] falls, giving rise to sandy river beaches and clean shallow waters. The waters are used for recreational boating and swimming.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Culture & Tourism|url=https://nigeriaembassygermany.org/Culture---Tourism.htm|access-date=8 February 2022|website=nigeriaembassygermany.org}}</ref> At Orokam in [[Ogbadibo]] Local government areas, occurs the Enumabia Warm Spring.
