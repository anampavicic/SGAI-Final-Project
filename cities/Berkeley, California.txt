'''Berkeley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|k|l|i}} {{respell|BURK|lee}}) is a city on the eastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]] in northern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[California]], United States. It is named after the 18th-century [[Anglo-Irish]] bishop and philosopher [[George Berkeley]]. It borders the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to the south and the city of [[Albany, California|Albany]] and the [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] of [[Kensington, California|Kensington]] to the north. Its eastern border with [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] generally follows the ridge of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. The [[2020 United States census|2020 census]] recorded a population of 124,321.

Berkeley is home to the oldest campus in the [[University of California]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], which is managed and operated by the university. It also has the [[Graduate Theological Union]], one of the largest religious studies institutions in the world. Berkeley is considered one of the most [[Modern liberalism in the United States|socially progressive]] cities in the United States.

==History==

===Indigenous history===
[[File:Acorn pit at Indian Rock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|This pit in the surface of a rock at [[Indian Rock Park]] is typical of those used by the [[Ohlone]] people to grind [[acorn]]s.]]

Human remains and skeletons from Native American burials have been unearthed in West Berkeley and on campus alongside [[Strawberry Creek]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mongoloid Type Skeleton is Dug Up at Berkeley |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=OT19250620.1.15&srpos=57&e=-------en--20-OT-41--txt-txIN-%22strawberry+creek%22-------1 |access-date=December 4, 2022 |work=Oakland Tribune |date=June 20, 1925}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dinkelspiel |first1=Frances |author-link=Frances Dinkelspiel |title=Ohlone human remains found in trench in West Berkeley |url=https://www.berkeleyside.org/2016/04/08/ohlone-remains-found-in-new-trench-on-berkeleys-fourth-st |access-date=December 12, 2022 |work=Bekeleyside |date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> Other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the [[Downtown Berkeley|downtown area]] during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.

===Spanish and Mexican eras===
The first people of European descent (most of whom were of mixed race and born in America<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anzasociety.org/the-spanish-myth/|title=The Spanish Myth|date=April 3, 2016|access-date=March 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304172443/https://anzasociety.org/the-spanish-myth/|archive-date=March 4, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>) arrived with the [[De Anza Expedition]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Juan Bautista de Anza|url=http://www.borregospringschamber.com/juan_bautista_de_anza.html|publisher=Borrego Springs Chamber of Commerce|access-date=February 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725052027/http://www.borregospringschamber.com/juan_bautista_de_anza.html|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The De Anza Expedition led to establishment of the Spanish [[Presidio of San Francisco]] at the entrance to San Francisco Bay (the "[[Golden Gate]])." [[Luis María Peralta|Luis Peralta]] was among the soldiers at the Presidio. For his services to the [[King of Spain]], he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of San Francisco Bay (the ''contra costa'', "opposite shore") for a ranch, including that portion that now comprises the City of Berkeley.
[[File:Peralta Family.jpg|thumb|right|Berkeley and much of the [[East Bay]] was part of [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]], granted to the [[Luís María Peralta|Peralta family]] in 1820.]]
Luis Peralta named his holding "[[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]." The primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides, but hunting and farming were also pursued. Eventually, Peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons. What is now Berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to Peralta's son [[José Domingo Peralta|Domingo]], with a little in the portion that went to another son, Vicente. No artifact survives of the Domingo or Vicente ranches, but their names survive in Berkeley street names (Vicente, Domingo, and Peralta). However, legal title to all land in the City of Berkeley remains based on the original Peralta land grant.

The Peraltas' Rancho San Antonio continued after [[Alta California]] passed from Spanish to Mexican sovereignty after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. However, the advent of U.S. sovereignty after the [[Mexican–American War]], and especially, the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], saw the Peraltas' lands quickly encroached on by [[squatter]]s and diminished by dubious legal proceedings. The lands of the brothers Domingo and Vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes. The rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various American claimants (''See'' [[Kellersberger's Map]]).

Politically, the area that became Berkeley was initially part of a vast [[Contra Costa County]]. On March 25, 1853, Alameda County was created from a division of Contra Costa County, as well as from a small portion of [[Santa Clara County]]. The area that became Berkeley was then the northern part of the "Oakland Township" subdivision of Alameda County. During this period, "Berkeley" was mostly a mix of open land, farms, and ranches, with a small, though busy, wharf by the bay.

===Late 19th century===
[[File:William Hahn - Horses Grazing, Berkeley, 1875.jpg|thumb|left|''Horses Grazing, Berkeley''; painted by artist [[William Hahn]] in 1875]]
In 1866, Oakland's private [[College of California]] looked for a new site. It settled on a location north of Oakland along the foot of the [[Berkeley Hills|Contra Costa Range]] (later called the Berkeley Hills) on [[Strawberry Creek]], at an elevation of about {{convert|500|ft}} above the bay, commanding a view of the Bay Area and the Pacific Ocean through the [[Golden Gate]].

According to the ''Centennial Record of the University of California'', "In 1866, at [[Founders' Rock]], a group of College of California men watched two ships standing out to sea through the Golden Gate. One of them, [[Frederick Billings]], thought of the lines of the Anglo-Irish Anglican Bishop [[George Berkeley]], 'westward the course of empire takes its way,' and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish philosopher."<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stadtman |editor-first=Verne |title=The Centennial Record of the University of California |publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] |year=1967 |page=114 |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00219&toc.depth=1&toc.id=div00219&brand=calisphere |access-date=June 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629052749/http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00219&toc.depth=1&toc.id=div00219&brand=calisphere |archive-date=June 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The philosopher's name is pronounced ''BARK-lee'', but the city's name, to accommodate [[American English]], is pronounced ''BERK-lee''.<ref>{{cite web |title=George Berkeley – Biography |publisher=[[European Graduate School]] |url=http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225225047/http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archive-date=February 25, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The College of California's College Homestead Association planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and they began a collaboration with the [[California|State of California]] that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public [[University of California]].

[[File:Berkeley. LOC 75693088.jpg|thumb|right|View of Berkeley in 1900]]
As construction began on the new site, more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus. At the same time, a settlement of residences, saloons, and various industries grew around the wharf area called [[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]. A [[horsecar]] ran from [[Temescal, Oakland, California|Temescal]] in Oakland to the university campus along what is now [[Telegraph Avenue]]. The first post office opened in 1872.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|601}}</ref>

By the 1870s, the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] reached its terminus in Oakland. In 1876, a branch line of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], was laid from a junction with the mainline called Shellmound (now a part of Emeryville) into what is now [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown Berkeley]]. That same year, the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into Oakland was re-routed, putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through Ocean View.

There was a strong prohibition movement in Berkeley at this time. In 1876, the state enacted the "mile limit law", which forbade sale or public consumption of alcohol within {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} of the new University of California.<ref>Berkeley Gazette. 1900 April 9</ref> Then, in 1899, Berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone. Scientists, scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol.<ref>Berkeley 1900: ''Daily Life at the Turn of the Century'', by Richard Schwartz. 2000. page 187</ref>

On April 1, 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the university campus, together with local farmers, were granted [[municipal corporation|incorporation]] by the State of California as the Town of Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1877/1877_78.PDF#page=956 |title = ''Statutes of California'', 1877–78, p. 888 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227230928/http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1877/1877_78.PDF#page=956 |archive-date=December 27, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of [[Denis Kearney]]'s anti-Chinese [[Workingman's Party]], who were particularly favored in the working-class area of the former Ocean View, now called West Berkeley.  During the 1880s Berkeley had segregated housing and anti-Chinese laws.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=Richard |title=The Chinese workers who fought discrimination at an 1880s West Berkeley soap factory |url=https://www.berkeleyside.org/2021/10/17/berkeley-soap-factory-chinese-workers-discrimination |access-date=October 13, 2022 |work=BerkeleySide}}</ref> The area near the university became known for a time as East Berkeley.

Due to the influence of the university, the modern age came quickly to Berkeley. [[Electric light]]s and the telephone were in use by 1888. Electric [[streetcar]]s soon replaced the [[horsecar]]. A silent film of one of these early streetcars in Berkeley can be seen at the [[Library of Congress]] website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/00694420/|title=Trip to Berkeley, California, Lcmp003 M3a29754|publisher=Library of Congress}}<!-- https://www.loc.gov/collections/san-francisco-earthquake-and-fire-1897-to-1916/?q=lcmp003%20m3a29754 --></ref>

Berkeley's slow growth ended abruptly with the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906]]. The town and other parts of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] escaped serious damage, and thousands of refugees flowed across the Bay. Among them were most of San Francisco's painters and sculptors, who between 1907 and 1911 created one of the largest art colonies west of Chicago. Artist and critic [[Jennie V.

In 1904, the first hospitals in Berkeley were created: the Alta Bates Sanatorium (today Alta Bates Summit Medical Center) for women and children, founded by nurse [[Alta Bates]] on Walnut Street, and the Roosevelt Hospital (later [[Herrick Hospital]]), founded by LeRoy Francis Herrick, on the corner of Dwight Way and Milvia Street.<ref name="pettitt">{{cite book |last= Pettitt|first= George Albert|date= 1973|title= Berkeley: the Town and Gown of it|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zWhwAAAAMAAJ|publisher= Howell-North Books|page= 106|isbn=978-0-8310-7101-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Planning_and_Development/Level_3_-_DAP/5%20Health%20and%20Medicine.pdf|title= Downtown Berkeley Historic Resources Reconnaissance Survey|date= August 2007|website= City of Berkeley|access-date= January 14, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170524231419/http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Planning_and_Development/Level_3_-_DAP/5%20Health%20and%20Medicine.pdf|archive-date= May 24, 2017|url-status= dead}}</ref>

In 1908, a statewide referendum that proposed moving the California state capital to Berkeley was defeated by a margin of about 33,000 votes.<ref>''Exactly Opposite the Golden Gate'', edited by Phil McCardle, published 1983 by the Berkeley Historical Society, p.251</ref> The city had named streets around the proposed capitol grounds for California counties. They bear those names today, a legacy of the failed referendum.

On September 17, 1923, [[1923 Berkeley Fire|a major fire]] swept down the hills toward the university campus and the downtown section. Around 640 structures burned before a late-afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress, allowing firefighters to put it out.

The next big growth occurred with the advent of [[World War II]], when large numbers of people moved to the Bay Area to work in the many war industries, such as the immense [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in nearby [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]. One who moved out, but played a big role in the outcome of the war, was U.C. professor and Berkeley resident [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. During the war, an Army base, [[Camp Ashby]], was temporarily sited in Berkeley.

The element [[berkelium]] was synthesized utilizing the {{Convert|60|in|m|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]] at UC Berkeley, and named in 1949, in recognition of the university, thus placing the city's name in the list of elements.

The postwar years brought moderate growth to the city, as events on the U.C. campus began to build up to the recognizable activism of the sixties. In the 1950s, [[McCarthyism]] induced the university to demand a loyalty oath from its professors, many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought. In 1960, a U.S. House committee ([[HUAC]]) came to San Francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the Bay Area. Their presence was met by protesters, including many from the university. Meanwhile, a number of U.C. students became active in the [[civil rights movement]]. Finally, in 1964, the university provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus. This protest became the [[Free Speech Movement]]. As the [[Vietnam War]] rapidly escalated in the ensuing years, so did student activism at the university, particularly that organized by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]].

[[File:People's-Park.jpg|thumb|right|The [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]] was created via public occupation during the [[1960s Berkeley protests]].]]
Berkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes, civic unrest, and political upheaval that characterized the mid-to-late 1960s.<ref>[http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/berkeley%20shattuck%20context%2005-28-2015.pdf "Shattuck Avenue: Commercial Corridor Historic Context and Survey"]. City of Berkeley. Retrieved October 5, 2017.</ref> In that period, Berkeley—especially [[Telegraph Avenue]]—became a focal point for the [[hippie]] movement, which spilled over the Bay from San Francisco. Many hippies were apolitical drop-outs, rather than students, but in the heady atmosphere of Berkeley in 1967–1969 there was considerable overlap between the hippie movement and the radical left. An iconic event in the Berkeley Sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of university property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called "[[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]]".

The battle over the disposition of People's Park resulted in a month-long occupation of Berkeley by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] on orders of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the end, the park remained undeveloped, and remains so today. A spin-off, ''People's Park Annex'', was established at the same time by activist citizens of Berkeley on a strip of land above the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] ("BART") underground construction along Hearst Avenue northwest of the U.C. campus. The land had also been intended for development, but was turned over to the city by BART and is now [[Ohlone Park]].

The era of large public protest in Berkeley waned considerably with the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. While the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in Berkeley, it remains one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic cities in the United States.

===1970s and 1980s===
====Housing and zoning changes====
[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Shattuck Avenue at Center Street in downtown Berkeley, as seen in 1973]]
After the 1960s, Berkeley banned most new housing construction, in particular apartments.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Savidge |first=Nico |date=July 25, 2023 |title=Berkeley is adding new housing at the fastest rate in decades |url=https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/07/25/berkeley-housing-boom-construction |website=Berkeleyside |language=en-US}}</ref>

Increasing enrollment at the university led to replacement of older buildings by large apartment buildings, especially in older parts of the city near the university and downtown. Increasing enrollment also led the university to wanting to redevelop certain places of Berkeley, especially Southside, but more specifically People's Park.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Don|title=Iconography and locational conflict from the underside: Free speech, People's Park, and the politics of homelessness in Berkeley, California|journal=Political Geography|volume=11|issue=2|pages=152–169|doi=10.1016/0962-6298(92)90046-V|year=1992}}</ref> [[Preservationists]] passed the Neighborhood Protection Ordinance in 1973 by ballot measure and the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance in 1974 by the City Council.

For cities such as Berkeley, where rent control was already in place, the law limited the use of rent control to units built before the local rent-control law was enacted, i.e. 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/What_is_Rent_Control_.aspx|title=What is Rent Control? ... and How Does It Affect Me?|publisher=City of Berkeley|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418081034/http://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/What_is_Rent_Control_.aspx|archive-date=April 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Political movements====
During the 1970s and 1980s, activists increased their power in local government. This era also saw major developments in Berkeley's environmental and food culture. Berkeley's last Republican mayor, [[Wallace J. S. Johnson]], left office in 1971. [[Alice Waters]] opened [[Chez Panisse]] in 1971. The first curbside recycling program in the U.S. was started by the [[Ecology Center (Berkeley)|Ecology Center]] in 1973. Styrofoam was banned in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecologycenter.org/about/history/|title=Our History|publisher=Ecology Center|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418001331/http://ecologycenter.org/about/history/|archive-date=April 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As the city leaned more and more Democratic, local politics became divided between "Progressives" and "Moderates". 1984 saw the Progressives take the majority for the first time. [[Nancy Skinner (California politician)|Nancy Skinner]] became the first UC Berkeley student elected to City Council. In 1986, in reaction to the 1984 election, a ballot measure switched Berkeley from at-large to district-based elections for city council.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark A.

In 1983, Berkeley's [[Domestic Partner Task Force]] was established, which in 1984 made policy recommendation to the school board, which passed [[domestic partner]] legislation. The legislation became a model for similar measures nationwide.<ref>{{cite news|author=Joe Garofoli |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Ethel-Manheimer-Berkeley-activist-dies-4110179.php |title=Ethel Manheimer, Berkeley activist, dies |publisher=SFGate |date=December 12, 2012 |access-date=January 1, 2013}}</ref>

===1990s and 2000s===
[[File:IMAG4094-berkeley-shattuck-between-haste-and-dwight.jpg|thumb|Housing developments in Downtown Berkeley]]
In 1995, California's Costa–Hawkins Act ended vacancy control, allowing rents to increase when a tenant moved out. Despite a slow down in 2005–2007, median home prices and rents remain dramatically higher than the rest of the nation,<ref>{{cite web|last=|title=Berkeley, CA Home Prices & Housing Information|url=http://www.areavibes.com/berkeley-ca/housing/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229110237/http://www.areavibes.com/berkeley-ca/housing/|archive-date=December 29, 2014|access-date=December 30, 2014|website=[[AreaVibes]]}}</ref> fueled by spillover from the [[San Francisco housing shortage]] and population growth.

South and West Berkeley underwent [[gentrification]], with some historically Black neighborhoods such as the Adeline Corridor seeing a 50% decline in Black / African American population from 1990 to 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=South Berkeley residents mobilize around plan to develop Adeline Street corridor|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2015/06/07/south-berkeley-residents-mobilize-around-plan-to-develop-adeline-street-corridor/|author=Chloee Weiner|publisher=Daily Cal|date=June 8, 2015|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=May 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524230440/http://www.dailycal.org/2015/06/07/south-berkeley-residents-mobilize-around-plan-to-develop-adeline-street-corridor/|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In the 1990s, public television's [[Frontline (American TV program)|Frontline]] documentary series featured race relations at Berkeley's only public high school, [[Berkeley High School (California)|Berkeley High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=School Colors|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/info/1301.html|publisher=Frontline|access-date=July 2, 2015|archive-date=July 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703125903/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/info/1301.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

With an economy dominated by the University of California and a high-demand housing market, Berkeley was relatively unaffected by the [[Great Recession]]. State budget cuts caused the university to increase the number of out-of-state and international students, with international enrollment, mostly from Asia, rising from 2,785 in 2007 to 5,951 in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/current/enrollment_data|title=International Student Enrollment Data|publisher=UC Berkeley|access-date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>  Since then, more international restaurants have opened downtown and on [[Telegraph Avenue]], including East Asian chains such as [[Ippudo]] and [[Daiso]].

A wave of downtown apartment construction began in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|author=Richard Brenneman|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2007-04-06/article/26725|title=Panoramic Sells Off 7 Apartment Buildings|newspaper=Berkeley Daily Planet|date=April 6, 2007|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418081607/http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2007-04-06/article/26725|archive-date=April 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[Berkeley Oak Grove Protest]] began protesting construction of a new sports center annex to Memorial Stadium at the expense of a grove of oak trees on the UC campus. The protest ended in September 2008 after a lengthy court process.

In 2007–2008, Berkeley received media attention due to demonstrations against a Marine Corps recruiting office in downtown Berkeley and a series of controversial motions by Berkeley's city council regarding opposition to Marine recruiting. (''See'' [[Berkeley Marine Corps Recruiting Center controversy]].)

===2010s and 2020s===
During the fall of 2010, the [[Berkeley Student Food Collective]] opened after many protests on the [[UC Berkeley]] campus due to the proposed opening of the fast food chain [[Panda Express]]. Students and community members worked together to open a collectively run grocery store right off of the UC Berkeley campus, where the community can buy local, seasonal, humane, and organic foods. The [[Berkeley Student Food Collective]] still operates at 2440 Bancroft Way.

On September 18, 2012, Berkeley became what may be the first city in the U.S. to officially proclaim a day recognizing bisexuals: September 23, which is known as [[Celebrate Bisexuality Day]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Berkeley becomes first US city to declare Bisexual Pride Day, support 'marginalized' group|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/berkeley-becomes-first-us-city-to-declare-bisexual-pride-day-support-marginalized-group/2012/09/18/8556fd92-0208-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=September 19, 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

During a [[Black Lives Matter]] protest on December 6, 2014, police use of tear gas and batons to clear protesters from Telegraph Avenue led to a riot and five consecutive days and nights of protests, marches, and freeway occupations in Berkeley and Oakland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police report mistakes, challenges in Berkeley protests|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/06/11/police-report-mistakes-challenges-in-berkeley-protests/|author=Emilie Raguso|publisher=Berkeleyside|date=June 11, 2015|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426114050/http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/06/11/police-report-mistakes-challenges-in-berkeley-protests/|archive-date=April 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Afterwards, changes were implemented by the Police Department to avoid escalation of violence and to protect bystanders during protests.<ref>{{cite news|title=BPD chief: Lessons learned in 2014 'Black Lives Matter' protests guided us during Milo demonstrations|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/05/berkeley-police-chief-lessons-learned-2014-black-lives-matter-protests-guided-us-milo-demonstrations/|author=Emilie Raguso|publisher=Berkeleyside|date=June 11, 2015|access-date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>

During a protest against bigotry and U.S. President Donald Trump in August 2017, self-described anti-fascist protesters attacked Trump supporters in attendance. Police intervened, arresting 14 people.

==== 1970s ====
Stereotypes of homeless people as deviant individuals who chose to live vagrant lifestyles continued to color the discourse around street-dwellers in American cities.<ref name=Mitchell1997/> However, this time period was also characterized by a subtle shift in the perception of unhoused individuals. The public began to realize that homelessness affected not only single men, but also women, children, and entire families.<ref name=Mitchell1997/> This recognition set the stage for the City of Berkeley's attitude towards homelessness in the next decade.<ref name=":1">{{cite magazine |last1=Horowitz |first1=David |last2=Collier |first2=Peter |title=Slouching towards Berkeley: socialism in one city |magazine=The Public Interest |date=Winter 1989 |issue=94 |pages=47–68 |id={{ProQuest|222074477}} |url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/slouching-towards-berkeley-socialism-in-one-city }}</ref>

==== 1980s ====
Organizations such as Building Opportunities for Self Sufficiency (BOSS) were established in 1971 in response to the needs of individuals with mental illness being released to the streets by state hospital closures.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://self-sufficiency.org/who-we-are/mission-history/| title=Mission & History| date=April 4, 2014| access-date=December 7, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207140323/https://self-sufficiency.org/who-we-are/mission-history/| archive-date=December 7, 2017| url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== 1990s ====
In the 1990s, the City of Berkeley faced a substantial increase in the need for emergency housing shelters and saw a rise in the average amount of time individuals spent without stable housing.<ref name=":4" /> As housing became a more widespread problem, the general public, Berkeley City Council, and the University of California became increasingly anti-homeless in their opinions.<ref name=":4" /> In 1994, Berkeley City Council considered the implementation of a set of anti-homeless laws that the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' described as being "among the strictest in the country".<ref name=Mitchell1997/> These laws prohibited sitting, sleeping and begging in public spaces, and outlawed panhandling from people in a variety of contexts, such as sitting on public benches, buying a newspaper from a rack, or waiting in line for a movie.<ref name=Mitchell1997/> In February 1995, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) sued the city for infringing free speech rights through its proposed anti-panhandling law.<ref name=Mitchell1997/> In May of that same year, a federal judge ruled that the anti-panhandling law did violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], but left the anti-sitting and sleeping laws untouched.<ref name=Mitchell1997/>

Following the implementation of these anti-sitting and sleeping ordinances in 1998, Berkeley increased its policing of homeless adults and youth, particularly in the shopping district surrounding [[Telegraph Avenue]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Amster|first=Randall|date=2003|title=Patterns of Exclusion: Sanitizing Space, Criminalizing Homelessness|jstor=29768172|journal=Social Justice|volume=30|issue=1 (91)|pages=195–221}}</ref> The mayor at that time, [[Shirley Dean]], proposed a plan to increase both social support services for homeless youth and enforcement of anti-encampment laws.<ref name=":5" /> Unhoused youth countered this plan with a request for the establishment of the city's first youth shelter, more trash cans, and more frequent cleaning of public bathrooms.<ref name=":5" />

The City of Berkeley has seen a consistent rise in the number of chronically homeless individuals over the past 30 years, and has implemented a number of different projects to reduce the number of people living on the streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofberkeley.info/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=4222|title=Records Online - City of Berkeley, CA|website=Cityofberkeley.info|language=en|access-date=May 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511150144/https://www.cityofberkeley.info/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=4222|archive-date=May 11, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2008, the City focused its efforts on addressing chronic homelessness.

However, the City saw a strong need for it to implement rules addressing encampments and public usage of space as well as assessing the resources needed to assist the unhoused population.<ref name=":7" /> In response to these needs the City of Berkeley established the Homeless Task Force, headed by then-Councilmember [[Jesse Arreguín]].<ref name=":7" /> Since its formation, the Task Force has proposed a number of different recommendations, from expanding the City Homeless Outreach and Mobile Crisis Teams, to building a short-term transitional shelter for unhoused individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/City_Council/2018/01_Jan/Documents/2018-01-23_Item_44_Update_On_Homeless_Task_Force.aspx|title=Arreguín, Jesse.

==Geography==
[[File:BayareaUSGS.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite map of the San Francisco Bay Area from the U.S. Geological Survey]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city's {{convert|17.7|sqmi|adj=on}} area includes {{convert|10.5|sqmi}} of land and {{convert|7.2|sqmi}} (40.83%) water, most of it part of [[San Francisco Bay]].

Berkeley borders the cities of Albany, Oakland, and Emeryville and Contra Costa County, including unincorporated Kensington, as well as San Francisco Bay.

Berkeley lies within telephone [[area code]] 510 (until September 2, 1991, Berkeley was part of the 415 telephone code that now covers only San Francisco and Marin counties<ref name=BerkeleyAreaCode>{{cite news|last=Fabisch|first=M.P.|title=Revised Date for Split of 415 (California) Numbering Plan Area|url=http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/old_pl/IL%2090-06-023.pdf|access-date=June 1, 2011|newspaper=BellCore Letter|date=June 6, 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120756/http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/old_pl/IL%2090-06-023.pdf|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>), and the postal [[ZIP code]]s are 94701 through 94710, 94712, and 94720 for the [[University of California]] campus.<ref name=zip />

===Geology===
Most of Berkeley lies on a rolling sedimentary plain that rises gently from sea level to the base of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. East of the [[Hayward Fault]] along the base of the hills, elevation increases more rapidly. The highest peak along the ridge line above Berkeley is [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]], at an elevation of {{convert|1754|ft}}. A number of small creeks run from the hills to the Bay through Berkeley: [[Cerrito Creek|Cerrito]], [[Codornices Creek|Codornices]], [[Schoolhouse Creek|Schoolhouse]], and [[Strawberry Creek|Strawberry]] Creeks are the principal streams. Most of these are largely [[culvert]]ed once they reach the plain west of the hills.

The Berkeley Hills are part of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]], and run in a northwest–southeast alignment. Exposed in the Berkeley Hills are cherts and shales of the Claremont Formation (equivalent to the [[Monterey Formation]]), conglomerate and sandstone of the Orinda Formation and lava flows of the Moraga Volcanics. Of similar age to the Moraga Volcanics (extinct), within the Northbrae neighborhood of Berkeley, are outcroppings of erosion resistant rhyolite. These [[rhyolite]] formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences. [[Indian Rock Park]] in the northeastern part of Berkeley near the Arlington/Marin Circle features a large example.

====Earthquakes====
Berkeley is traversed by the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], a major branch of the [[San Andreas Fault]] to the west. No large earthquake has occurred on the Hayward Fault near Berkeley in historic times (except possibly in 1836), but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large temblors several times in the deeper past. The current assessment is that a Bay Area earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater within the next 30 years is likely, with the Hayward Fault having the highest likelihood among faults in the Bay Area of being the epicenter.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|title = 2008 Bay Area Earthquake Probabilities|access-date = June 26, 2015|website = USGS|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150629012606/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|archive-date = June 29, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Moreover, like much of the Bay Area, Berkeley has many areas of some risk to [[soil liquefaction]], with the flat areas closer to the shore at low to high susceptibility.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|title = U.S. Geological Survey Liquefaction Hazard Maps|access-date = February 18, 2015|website = U.S. Geological Survey|publisher = USGS|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150219045641/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|archive-date = February 19, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

The [[1868 Hayward earthquake]] did occur on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1868/10/22/87584244.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 22, 1868 |title=Earthquake in San Francisco and Neighboring Places |access-date=June 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116005156/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1868/10/22/87584244.pdf |archive-date=January 16, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in the vicinity of today's city of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]]. This quake destroyed the county seat of Alameda County then located in [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] and it subsequently moved to Oakland. It was strongly felt in San Francisco, causing major damage. It was regarded as the "Great San Francisco earthquake" prior to 1906. It produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in Berkeley, across the grounds of the new [[State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind]] then under construction, which was noted by one early University of California professor. Although no significant damage was reported to most of the few Berkeley buildings of the time, the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of Domingo Peralta in north Berkeley.<ref>Lawson, A. C. (ed.), ''The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906'', 1908, Reprinted 1969 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This is a comprehensive report on the 1906 earthquake, published by the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, and comprises two volumes and an atlas. It contains a discussion of the 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake and its effects, and includes a number of photos taken by Lawson himself of damage in Berkeley caused by the 1906 quake. The report is available from the USGS. {{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/1906calif/18april/references.php |title=1906 Earthquake – References |website=Earthquake.usgs.gov}}</ref>

Today, evidence of the Hayward Fault's "creeping" is visible at various locations in Berkeley. Cracked roadways, sharp jogs in streams, and springs mark the fault's path. However, since it cuts across the base of the hills, the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity. Some of the slide activity itself, however, results from movement on the Hayward Fault.

A notorious segment of the Hayward Fault runs lengthwise down the middle of [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon on the University of California campus.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://haywardfaultucberkeley.pressbooks.com/chapter/the-california-memorial-stadium/|title=The California Memorial Stadium|first=Horst|last=Rademacher|website=Haywardfaultucberkeley.pressbooks.com}}</ref> Photos and measurements show the movement of the fault through the stadium.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rademacher |first=Horst |url=https://earthquakes.berkeley.edu/docs/HF_Tour_Stadium-1.1-Protected.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://earthquakes.berkeley.edu/docs/HF_Tour_Stadium-1.1-Protected.pdf |archive-date=October 9, 2022 |url-status=live |title=The Hayward Fault at the Campus of the University of California, Berkeley: A Guide to a Brief Walking Tour |date=June 6, 2017 |publisher=Berkeley Seismological Laboratory |pages=17–21}}</ref>

===Climate===
Berkeley has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Berkeley's location directly opposite the [[Golden Gate]] ensures that typical eastward [[San Francisco fog|fog]] flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0107/b.html |title=Jane Houston Jones. ''San Francisco Weather – Weird and Wacky''. SJAA Ephemeris July 2001 |publisher=Ephemeris.sjaa.net |date=July 19, 2007 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> The summers are cooler than a typical [[Mediterranean climate]] thanks to [[upwelling]] ocean currents along the California coast. These help produce cool and foggy nights and mornings.

Winter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature. Summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or fog, followed by sunny, warm days. The warmest and driest months are typically June through September, with the highest temperatures occurring in September. Mid-summer (July–August) is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then.

In a year, there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of {{convert|90|°F}} or higher, and an average of 0.8 days with lows of {{convert|32|°F}} or lower. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|107|°F}} on June 15, 2000, and July 16, 1993, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|24|°F}} on December 22, 1990.

February is normally the wettest month, averaging {{convert|5.21|in|mm}} of precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|25.40|in|mm}}, falling on an average of 63.7 days each year. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|14.49|in|mm}} in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|6.98|in|mm}} on January 4, 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|title=Climatography of the United States : No. 20 : 1971-2000|publisher=Cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov|access-date=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725104836/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> As in most of California, the heaviest rainfall years are usually associated with warm water [[El Niño]] episodes in the Pacific (e.g., 1982–83; 1997–98), which bring in drenching "[[Pineapple Express]]" storms. In contrast, dry years are often associated with cold Pacific [[La Niña]] episodes. Light snow has fallen on rare occasions. Snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the [[Berkeley Hills]].<ref>Western Regional Climate Center Web site</ref>

In the late spring and early fall, strong [[Diablo wind|offshore winds]] of sinking air typically develop, bringing heat and dryness to the area. In the spring, this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains, but extreme dryness prevails by the fall, creating a danger of wildfires. In September 1923, [[1923 Berkeley fire|a major fire]] swept through the neighborhoods north of the university campus, stopping just short of downtown.  On [[1991 Oakland firestorm|October 20, 1991]], gusty, hot winds fanned a conflagration along the Berkeley–Oakland border, killing 25 people and injuring 150, as well as destroying 2,449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units.

==Transportation==
Berkeley is served by [[Amtrak]] ([[Capitol Corridor]]), [[AC Transit]], [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] ([[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby]], [[Downtown Berkeley Station]] and [[North Berkeley (BART)|North Berkeley]]) and bus shuttles operated by major employers including [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]]) runs along the bay shoreline. Each day there is an influx of thousands of cars into the city by commuting UC faculty, staff and students, making parking for more than a few hours an expensive proposition.

Berkeley has one of the highest rates of bicycle and pedestrian commuting in the nation. Berkeley is the safest city of its size in California for pedestrians and cyclists, considering the number of injuries per pedestrian and cyclist, rather than per capita.<ref>[http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/contentdisplay.aspx?id=8512 Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety in Berkeley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423172843/http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=8512 |date=April 23, 2010 }}, City of Berkeley.</ref>

[[File:IMAG4107-berkeley-etna-and-dwight.jpg|thumb|A street closed off into two dead ends by traffic calming barriers. A gap in the middle allows passage of bikes and emergency vehicles.]]
Berkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers, moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets (visitors often find this confusing, because the diverters are not shown on all maps). Berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles, called [[Bicycle Boulevards]], with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel. Attempts to improve the biking infrastructure in Berkeley have been met with controversy. In 2023, the Berkeley city council fired the city's top transportation official for a plan to remove dozens of parking spots on a street to build a protected bike lane.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Savidge |first=Nico |date=May 16, 2023 |title=Berkeley's top transportation official is out of his job |url=https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/05/16/berkeley-farid-javandel-transportation-division-hopkins-investigation |website=Berkeleyside |language=en-US}}</ref>

Berkeley hosts [[car sharing]] networks including [[Uhaul Car Share]], [[Gig Car Share]], and [[Zipcar]]. Rather than owning (and parking) their own cars, members share a group of cars parked nearby. Web- and telephone-based reservation systems keep track of hours and charges. Several "pods" (points of departure where cars are kept) exist throughout the city, in several downtown locations, at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations, and at various other locations in Berkeley (and other cities in the region). Using alternative transportation is encouraged.

Berkeley has had recurring problems with [[parking meter]] vandalism. In 1999, over 2,400 Berkeley meters were jammed, smashed, or sawed apart.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/01/25/BAG664HDH31.DTL "Chicanery tops meters in Berkeley"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref> Starting in 2005 and continuing into 2006, Berkeley began to phase out mechanical meters in favor of more centralized electronic meters.

===Transportation history===
The first commuter service to San Francisco was provided by the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]'s [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], a [[standard gauge]] [[steam railroad]], which terminated in downtown Berkeley, and connected in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] (at a locale then known as "Shellmound") with trains to the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland ferry pier]] as well as with the Central Pacific main line starting in 1876. The Berkeley Branch line was extended from Shattuck and University to Vine Street ("Berryman's Station") in 1878. Starting in 1882, Berkeley trains ran directly to the Oakland Pier.<ref>''Berkeley Gazette'', January 22, 1903</ref> In the 1880s, [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] assumed operations of the Berkeley Branch under a lease from its own paper affiliate, the Northern Railway. In 1911, Southern Pacific electrified this line and the several others it constructed in Berkeley, creating its [[East Bay Electric Lines]] division. The huge and heavy cars specially built for these lines were called the "Red Trains" or the "Big Red Cars". The Shattuck line was extended and connected with two other Berkeley lines (the Ninth Street Line and the California Street line) at Solano and Colusa (the "Colusa [[Wye (rail)|Wye]]"). At this time, the [[Northbrae Tunnel]] and Rose Street Undercrossing were constructed, both of which still exist. (The Rose Street Undercrossing is not accessible to the public, being situated between what is now two backyards.) The fourth Berkeley line was the Ellsworth St. line to the university campus. The last Red Trains ran in July 1941.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Robert S. |title=Red Trains in the East Bay: The History of the Southern Pacific Transbay Train and Ferry System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PT8fAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=65 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=978-0-916374-27-3}}</ref>

The first electric rail service in Berkeley was provided by several small [[streetcar]] companies starting in 1891. Most of these were eventually bought up by the [[Key System]] of [[Francis "Borax" Smith]] who added lines and improved equipment. The Key System's streetcars were operated by its East Bay Street Railways division. Principal lines in Berkeley ran on Euclid, The Arlington, {{proper name|College}}, Telegraph, Shattuck, San Pablo, {{proper name|University}}, and Grove (today's Martin Luther King Jr. Way). The last streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.

The first electric commuter interurban-type trains to San Francisco from Berkeley were put in operation by the Key System in 1903, several years before the Southern Pacific electrified its steam commuter lines. Like the SP, Key trains ran to a pier serviced by the Key's own fleet of [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferryboats]], which also docked at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. After the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was built, the Key trains ran to the [[Transbay Terminal]] in San Francisco, sharing tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge with the SP's red trains and the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railroad. It was at this time that the Key trains acquired their letter designations, which were later preserved by Key's public successor, AC Transit. Today's F bus is the successor of the F train. Likewise, the E, G and the H. Before the Bridge, these lines were simply the Shattuck Avenue Line, the Claremont Line, the Westbrae Line, and the Sacramento Street Line, respectively.

After the Southern Pacific abandoned transbay service in 1941, the Key System acquired the rights to use its tracks and [[overhead lines|catenary]] on Shattuck north of Dwight Way and through the Northbrae Tunnel to The Alameda for the F-train. The SP tracks along Monterey Avenue as far as Colusa had been acquired by the Key System in 1933 for the H-train, but were abandoned in 1941. The Key System trains stopped running in April 1958.<ref>{{cite book |last=Demoro |first=Harre W. |title=The Key Route: Transbay Commuting by Train and Ferry, Part 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p0wfAQAAIAAJ |year=1985 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=95 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=978-0-916374-66-2}}</ref> On December 15, 1962, the Northbrae Tunnel was opened to auto traffic.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/Californiahighways/chpw_1963_marapr.pdf| title = ''California Highways and Public Works'', March-April 1963, pp.61-64}}</ref>

{{Main|List of companies based in Berkeley, California}}
Berkeley is the location of a number of nationally prominent businesses, many of which have been pioneers in their areas of operation. Notable businesses include [[Chez Panisse]], birthplace of [[California cuisine]], [[Peet's]] Coffee's original store, the [[Claremont Resort]], punk rock haven [[924 Gilman]], [[Saul Zaentz]]'s [[Fantasy Studios]], and [[Caffe Strada]]. Notable former businesses include pioneer bookseller [[Cody's Books]], [[The Nature Company]], [[The North Face]], [[Clif Bar]] energy foods, the [[Consumers' Cooperative of Berkeley|Berkeley Co-op]], and [[Caffe Mediterraneum]].

Berkeley has relatively few [[chain stores]] for a city of its size, due to policies and zoning that promote small businesses<ref>{{cite web|title=Economic Development and Employment Element|url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/Planning_and_Development/Home/General_Plan_-_Economic_Development_and_Employment_Element.aspx|website=General Plan|publisher=City of Berkeley|access-date=April 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419195923/http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/Planning_and_Development/Home/General_Plan_-_Economic_Development_and_Employment_Element.aspx|archive-date=April 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and impose limits on the size of certain types of stores.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Massara|first1=G.

[[File:Old House on Bancroft Way - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spanish Colonial Revival]] architecture on Bancroft Way.]]
*[[Shattuck Avenue]] passes through several neighborhoods from north to south, including the [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown business district]] in Berkeley. It is named for [[Francis K. Shattuck]], one of Berkeley's earliest influential citizens and the most prominent civic leader in the early history of Berkeley. He played an important role in the creation and government of Alameda County as well.
*University Avenue runs from Berkeley's bayshore and marina in the west to the University of California campus in the east.
*College Avenue, running from the University of California from the north to Broadway in [[Oakland]] in the south close to the foothill, is a relatively quiet street compared with other major streets in Berkeley. It supports many restaurants and small shops.
*Ashby Avenue ([[California State Route 13|Highway 13]]), which also runs from Berkeley's bayshore to the hills, connects with the Warren Freeway and [[California State Route 24|Highway 24]] leading to the [[Caldecott Tunnel]], named for a former Berkeley mayor.
*[[San Pablo Avenue]] ([[California State Route 123|Highway 123]]) runs north–south through West Berkeley, connecting [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to the south and [[Albany, California|Albany]] to the north.
*[[Telegraph Avenue]], which runs north–south from the university campus to Oakland, historically the site of much of the [[hippie]] culture of Berkeley.

[[File:Claremonthotel03192006.JPG|thumb|280px|The historic [[Claremont Hotel & Spa|Claremont Resort]], located in the [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont]] district.]]

Berkeley has a number of distinct neighborhoods. Surrounding the [[University of California, Berkeley Campus Architecture|University of California campus]] are the most densely populated parts of the city. West of the campus is '''[[Downtown Berkeley, California|Downtown Berkeley]]''', the city's traditional commercial core; home of the [[civic center]], the city's only public [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], the busiest [[Downtown Berkeley Station|BART station]] in Berkeley, as well as a major transfer point for [[AC Transit]] buses. South of the campus is '''[[Southside, Berkeley, California|Southside]]''', mainly a [[student ghetto]], where much of the university's [[UC Berkeley student housing|student housing]] is located. The busiest stretch of [[Telegraph Avenue]] is in this neighborhood. North of the campus is the quieter '''[[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]]''' neighborhood, the location of the [[Graduate Theological Union]].

Farther from the university campus, the influence of the university quickly becomes less visible. Most of Berkeley's neighborhoods are primarily made up of detached houses, often with separate in-law units in the rear, although larger apartment buildings are also common in many neighborhoods. Commercial activities are concentrated along the major avenues and at important intersections and frequently define the neighborhood within which they reside.

In the southeastern corner of the city is the '''[[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont District]]''', home to the [[Claremont Resort|Claremont Hotel]]. Also in the southeast is the '''[[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood District]]''' known for its commercial area on College Avenue. West of Elmwood is '''[[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]]''', known for its weekend [[flea market]] at the [[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby Station]].

West of (and including) San Pablo Avenue, itself a major commercial and transport corridor, is '''[[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]]''', the historic commercial center of the city. This neighborhood and area includes the former unincorporated town of '''[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]'''. West Berkeley contains the remnants of Berkeley's industrial area, much of which has been replaced by retail and office uses, as well as residential live/work loft space, paralleling the decline of manufacturing in the United States. This area abuts the shoreline of the San Francisco Bay and is home to the [[Berkeley Marina]]. Also nearby is Berkeley's [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]], featuring an artificial linear lagoon of San Francisco Bay.

North of downtown is '''[[North Berkeley, Berkeley, California|North Berkeley]]''' which has its main commercial area nicknamed the "[[Gourmet Ghetto]]" because of the concentration of well-known restaurants and other food-related businesses. West of North Berkeley (roughly west of Sacramento and north of Cedar) is '''[[Westbrae, Berkeley, California|Westbrae]]''', a small neighborhood centered on a small commercial area on Gilman Street and through which part of the [[Ohlone Greenway]] runs. Meanwhile, further north of North Berkeley are '''[[Northbrae, Berkeley, California|Northbrae]]''', a master-planned subdivision from the early 20th century, and '''[[Thousand Oaks, Berkeley, California|Thousand Oaks]]'''. Above these last three neighborhoods, on the western slopes of the [[Berkeley Hills]] are the neighborhoods of '''[[Cragmont, Berkeley|Cragmont]]''' and '''[[La Loma Park]]''', notable for their dramatic views, winding streets, and numerous public stairways and paths.
