{{Nihongo|'''Nagasaki Prefecture'''|長崎県|Nagasaki-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]], mainly located on the island of [[Kyūshū]], although it also includes a number of islands off Kyūshū's northwest coast - including Tsushima and Iki. Nagasaki Prefecture has a population of 1,314,078 (1 June 2020) and has a geographic area of 4,130 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (1,594 [[sq mi]]). Nagasaki Prefecture borders [[Saga Prefecture]] to the northeast.

[[Nagasaki]] is the capital and largest city of Nagasaki Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Sasebo]], [[Isahaya, Nagasaki|Isahaya]], and [[Ōmura, Nagasaki|Ōmura]]. Nagasaki Prefecture is located in western Kyūshū with a territory consisting of many mainland [[peninsula]]s centered around [[Ōmura Bay]], as well as islands and [[archipelago]]s including [[Tsushima Island|Tsushima]] and [[Iki Island|Iki]] in the [[Korea Strait]] and the [[Gotō Islands]] in the [[East China Sea]]. Nagasaki Prefecture is known for its century-long [[Nanban trade|trading history with the Europeans]] and as the sole place of direct trade and exchange between Japan and the outside world during the ''[[Sakoku]]'' period. Nagasaki Prefecture is home to several of the [[Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region]] which have been declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Nagasaki Prefecture}}

Nagasaki Prefecture was created by merging of the western half of the former province of [[Hizen Province|Hizen]] with the island provinces of [[Tsushima Province|Tsushima]] and [[Iki Province|Iki]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia|page=780}}.</ref> Facing China and Korea, the region around [[Hirado, Nagasaki|Hirado]] was a traditional center for traders and pirates.

[[File:Kuichi Uchida View of Nagasaki Japan 1872 Hand-colored Vintage Albumen Print.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kuichi Uchida]]'s image of Nagasaki in 1872]]

During the 16th century, [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionaries]] and traders from [[Portugal]] arrived and became active in Hirado and Nagasaki, which became a major center for foreign trade. After being given free rein in [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s period, the missionaries were forced out little by little, until finally, in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] era, Christianity was banned under the ''[[Sakoku]]'' national isolation policy: Japanese foreign trade was restricted to Chinese and Dutch traders based at [[Dejima]] in Nagasaki. However, ''[[Kirishitan]]'' (Japanese Christian) worship continued underground. These ''[[Kakure Kirishitan]]'' (hidden Christians) were tried at every step, forced to step on [[Fumie|''fumi-e'']] ("trample pictures", images of the [[Virgin Mary]] and saints) to prove that they were non-Christian. With the banishment of all Catholic [[missionaries]], traders from Catholic countries were also forced out of the country. Along with them, their children, half Japanese and half European, were forced to leave. The majority was sent to Jagatara ([[Jakarta]]) and are still remembered by the locals as the people who wrote the poignant letters which were smuggled across the sea to their homeland.

Today, Nagasaki has prominent Catholic churches, and the [[Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region]], have been included on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites in Japan|World Heritage List]].

[[File:Prefect Office Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|Nagasaki Prefect Office, Meiji Period]]

During the [[Meiji Restoration]], Nagasaki and [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] became major ports for foreign trade, and eventually major military bases and shipbuilding centers for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] and the [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] up to [[World War II]]. [[Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki|On August 9, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki]], which destroyed all buildings in a {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1}} radius from the point of impact and extensively damaged other parts of the city. Roughly 39,000 people were killed, including 27,778 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean forced workers, and 150 Japanese soldiers. About 68-80% of the industrial production was destroyed to the point it would not recover for months or at least a year.

[[File:諫早豪雨(2).jpg|thumb|right|220px|An overview of 1957 Isahaya floods]]
Nagasaki Prefecture contains many areas prone to heavy rain and subsequent landslide damage. In July 1957, mainly in the Isahaya area, damage from heavy rains, flooding and landslides lead to a death toll of 586, with 136 people missing and 3,860 injured. In July 1982, typhoon damage in the Nagasaki area lead to 299 fatalities, according to a report by the Japanese government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Geography ==
Nagasaki borders [[Saga Prefecture]] on the east, and is otherwise surrounded by water, including [[Ariake Bay]], the [[Tsushima Straits]] (far from [[Busan]] and [[South Gyeongsang Province]], [[South Korea]]), and the [[East China Sea]]. It also includes a large number of islands such as [[Tsushima Island|Tsushima]], [[Iki Island|Iki]] and [[Goto Islands|Goto]]. Most of the prefecture is near the coast and there are a number of ports such as [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and a [[United States Navy]] base at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]].

As of 1 April 2014, 18% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Saikai National Park|Saikai]] and [[Unzen-Amakusa National Park|Unzen-Amakusa]] National Parks; [[Genkai Quasi-National Park|Genkai]] and [[Iki-Tsushima Quasi-National Park|Iki-Tsushima]] Quasi-National Parks; and [[Hokushō Prefectural Natural Park|Hokushō]], [[Nishi Sonogi Hantō Prefectural Natural Park|Nishi Sonogi Hantō]], [[Nomo Hantō Prefectural Natural Park|Nomo Hantō]], [[Ōmurawan Prefectural Natural Park|Ōmurawan]], [[Shimabara Hantō Prefectural Natural Park|Shimabara Hantō]], and [[Taradake Prefectural Natural Park (Nagasaki)|Taradake]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=1 April 2014 |access-date=8 February 2015}}</ref>

Nagasaki is the most [[Christianity in Japan|Christianized area in Japan]] with Roman Catholic missions having been established there as early as the 16th century. [[Shusaku Endo]]'s novel ''[[Silence (Endō novel)|Silence]]'' draws from the oral history of the local Christian ([[Kirishitan]]) communities, both [[Kakure Kirishitan]] and [[Hanare Kirishitan]].

As of 2002, there are 68,617 [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Nagasaki Prefecture, accounting for 4.52 percent of the population of the prefecture.

The {{ill|Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly|ja|長崎県議会}} has a regular membership of 46, elected in 16 electoral districts in unified regional elections (last round: [[2011 Japanese unified local elections|2011]]). As of April 2014, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]]-led caucus has 23 members, the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|DPJ]]-[[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|SDP]]-led caucus 17.

In the National Diet, Nagasaki is represented by four directly elected members of the House of Representatives and two (one per ordinary election) of the House of Councillors. After the most recent national elections of 2010, 2012 and 2013, Nagasaki sends an all-LDP delegation to the Diet (excluding members who lost election in Nagasaki districts, but were elected to the proportional representation segment of the House of Representatives in the [[Kyūshū PR block|Kyūshū block]]).
