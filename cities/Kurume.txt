{{nihongo|'''Kurume'''|久留米市|Kurume-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], Japan. {{As of |2024|02|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 295,367 in 137,140 households, and a  [[population density]] of 1309 people per km².<ref name="Kurume-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.kurume.fukuoka.jp/1100keikaku/2010shoukai/3040toukei/toukei.htmll|title= Kurume City official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{cvt|229.96|km2}}.

==Geography==
Kurume is located in the Chikugo Plain in southern Fukuoka Prefecture. The urban center is located approximately 40 kilometers from the prefectural capital at Fukuoka City, but due to the incorporation of surrounding municipalities in 2005, the city area has become approximately 32 kilometers east-west and approximately 16 kilometers north-south, making it a municipality with a long east-west direction. The [[Chikugo River]] flows from the northeast to the southwest of the city. The boundary is drawn almost along the river, and there are only a few parts of the city where the Chikugo River runs through the city. From the southern part of the city to the southeastern part is a mountain range called the Minou Mountain Range, which includes mountains such as Mt. Takatori, Mt. Hatsushin, and Mt. Mino.

==History==
The area of Kurume was part of ancient [[Chikugo Province]], and the location of its ancient [[kokufu|provincial capital]] and the site of its ''[[kokubun-ji]]'' and ''[[ichinomiya]]''.  During the [[Edo Period]] the area was under the control of [[Kurume Domain]], ruled for most of its history by the [[Arima clan]], who developed the ''[[jōkamachi]]'' around [[Kurume Castle]] into a commercial center due to the clan's policy to promote industries. [[Bairin-ji (Kurume)|Bairin-ji]], the clan’s family temple was also founded in the relative vicinity of the castle. After the [[Meiji restoration]], the city of Kurume was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. 

After the First World War from 1915 to 1919, over 1000 German and about 50 Austro-Hungarian soldiers (Prisoners of War) after surrendering at Tsingtao, were allocated to an internment camp in Kurume, which was the largest such camp in Japan. It is a widely accepted historical fact that the prisoners of war after the First World War in Japan were treated fairly and according to international conventions, as “fellow soldiers”. It is well documented that in Camp Kurume it was allowed to organize various sport activities, musical concerts and theatre performances. The pictures of such activities show POWs in good physical shape and often in good spirits.
[[File:Vie au camp de prisonniers de Kurume- Acrivités théätrales.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre Activity in Camp Kurume]]
The cultural and other exchanges between the Western and Japanese soldiers, as well as local people made a long lasting impact on both the cultural and industrial development of the city. The prisoners’ work and skills contributed to the development of the local rubber industry which served as a basis for the now world-famous tyre manufacturer Bridgestone.<ref>{{cite web|author=Adsushi Odsuru|url= https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/pdf/1914-1918-Online-prisoners_of_war_japan-2014-10-08.pdf#page7|title=Prisoners of War (Japan)|access-date=2024-03-18}}</ref>

Kurume was a garrison town for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and from 1922, a center for the rubber and chemical industries. During [[World War II]], the Kurume air raid left 212 people dead and much of the urban center destroyed.  The city area continued to expand throughout the post-war period by annexing surrounding villages and towns. On April 1, 2001, Kurume was designated as a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] and on April 1, 2008, it became a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]].

On February 5, 2005, the town of [[Kitano, Fukuoka|Kitano]] (from [[Mii District, Fukuoka|Mii District]]), the towns of [[Jōjima, Fukuoka|Jōjima]] and [[Mizuma, Fukuoka|Mizuma]] (both from [[Mizuma District, Fukuoka|Mizuma District]]), and the town of [[Tanushimaru, Fukuoka|Tanushimaru]] (from [[Ukiha District, Fukuoka|Ukiha District]]) were merged into Kurume.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Government==
Kurume has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 36 members. Kurume, together with the city of Ukiha contributes five members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Fukuoka 6th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
Kurume is a regional commercial center. In terms of industry, the city is the birthplace of [[Bridgestone]] and is an important production base as the group's original plant remains located here. There are also many factories of various  manufacturers of rubber processed products. In recent years, the light vehicle engine factory of Daihatsu Kyushu, a subsidiary of Daihatsu Motor Corporation, and the press parts manufacturing factory of Topre Kyushu, a subsidiary of Topre, have expanded into the area, playing a role in the consolidation of the automobile industry in northern Kyushu.
