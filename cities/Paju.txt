==Specialties==
===Jangdan bean===

Jangdan beans are one of Paju’s famous traditional specialties. From a long time ago, crops have been important for Korean people’s livelihood because their land and environment were suited for agriculture. Therefore, two major crops, rice and bean, have been developed over time. Jangdan bean is one of these crops which have been harvested in Paju. The name Jangdan is derived from the name of a village in Paju, which existed before the Korean War. Even though the village is now gone, people still call the bean the Jangdan bean because the former village was so well known for these beans. Today, Jangdan beans are only commonly seen In Panmunjom which is located at the border between South Korea and North Korea.<ref>Hwang, Gyoik. "Paju Jangdan Bean."
