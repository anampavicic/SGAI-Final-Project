'''Ghent''' ({{langx|nl|Gent}} {{IPA|nl|ɣɛnt||nl-Gent.ogg}}; {{langx|fr|Gand}} {{IPA|fr|ɡɑ̃||LL-Q150 (fra)-Jérémy-Günther-Heinz Jähnick-Gand.wav}}; historically known as ''Gaunt'' in English) is a [[City status in Belgium|city]] and a [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipality]] in the [[Flemish Region]] of [[Belgium]]. It is the capital and largest city of the [[Provinces of Belgium|province]] of [[East Flanders]], and the third largest in the country, after [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/23/ghent-fine-art-medieval-belgium-holiday-city-break-beer |title=Medieval and magical, vibrant and edgy – the Belgian city is a sensory overload  |date=23 February 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 March 2020 }}</ref> It is a [[Port of Ghent|port]] and [[Ghent University|university]] city.
 
The city originally started as a settlement at the confluence of the Rivers [[Scheldt]] and [[Leie]] and in the [[Late Middle Ages]] became one of the largest and richest cities of [[northern Europe]], with some 50,000 people in 1300. After the late 16th century Ghent became a less important city, resulting in an extremely well-preserved historic centre, that now makes Ghent an important destination of tourism.

The municipality comprises the city of Ghent proper and the surrounding suburbs of [[Afsnee]], [[Desteldonk]], [[Drongen]], [[Gentbrugge]], [[Ledeberg]], [[Mariakerke, East Flanders|Mariakerke]], [[Mendonk]], [[Oostakker]], [[Sint-Amandsberg]], [[Sint-Denijs-Westrem]], [[Sint-Kruis-Winkel]], [[Wondelgem]] and [[Zwijnaarde]]. With 262,219 inhabitants at the beginning of 2019, Ghent is Belgium's second largest municipality by number of inhabitants. The [[metropolitan areas in Belgium|metropolitan area]], including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of {{convert|1205|km²|0|abbr=on}} and had a total population of 560,522 as of 1 January 2018, which ranks it as the fourth most populous in Belgium.<ref name="BelMun2008">[http://statbel.fgov.be/downloads/pop200801com.xls Statistics Belgium; ''Werkelijke bevolking per gemeente op 1 januari 2008'' ('''excel-file''')] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126165629/http://statbel.fgov.be/downloads/pop200801com.xls |date=26 January 2009 }} Population of all municipalities in Belgium, as of 1 January 2008.

{{For timeline}}

Archaeological evidence shows human presence around the confluence of the Scheldt and the Leie going back as far as the [[Stone Age]] and the [[Iron Age]].<ref name="gent.be-history">{{cite web

Most historians believe that the older name for Ghent, 'Ganda', is derived from the [[Celts|Celtic]] word ''ganda'', which means '[[confluence]]',<ref name="gent.be-history"/> or 'river mouth', referring to the [[Lys (river)|Leie]] river debouching into the [[Scheldt]]. Other sources connect its name with an obscure deity named [[Gontia (deity)|Gontia]].<ref>Adrian Room, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdmNngEACAAJ ''Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features, and Historic Sites''], McFarland, 2006, p. 144.</ref>

There are no written records of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, but archaeological research confirms that the Ghent area continued to be inhabited.

When the [[Franks]] invaded the Roman territories from the end of the 4th century and well into the 5th century, they brought their language with them, and Celtic and Latin were replaced by [[Old Dutch]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Ghent hist centrum 2.jpg|left|thumb|Buildings along the river [[Leie]] in Ghent]]

Around 650, [[Saint Amand]] founded two [[abbey]]s in Ghent: [[St. Peter's Abbey, Ghent|St. Peter's]] ([[Blandijnberg|Blandinium]]) and [[Saint Bavo's Abbey|St. Bavo's Abbey]]. Around 800, [[Louis the Pious]], son of [[Charlemagne]], appointed [[Einhard]], the biographer of Charlemagne, abbot of both abbeys. The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys, and a commercial centre. However, in 851 and 879 the city was plundered by [[Viking]]s. 
 
Under the protection of the [[County of Flanders]] the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small [[city-state]]. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after [[Paris]]; it was bigger than [[Cologne]] or [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholas|first=David|title=The Domestic Life of a Medieval City: Women, Children and the Family in Fourteenth Century Ghent|pages=1}}</ref> Up to 65,000 people lived within the city walls. The [[Belfry of Ghent|belfry]] and the towers of the [[St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent|St. Bavo's Cathedral]] and [[Saint Nicholas Church, Ghent|St. Nicholas' Church]] are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.

The rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass 'meersen' ("[[water-meadows]]": a word related to the English '[[marsh]]') were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used to make cloth. Ghent was the leading city for [[cloth]] during the Middle Ages.

The [[Wool#History|wool industry]], originally established at [[Bruges]], created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from Scotland and England, which led to Flanders' good relationship with them. However, during the [[Hundred Years' War]], trade with England suffered significantly. Ghent was the birthplace of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], Duke of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]].

===Early modern period===
The city recovered in the 15th century when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]]. High taxes [[Revolt of Ghent (1449–1453)|led to a rebellion]] and eventually to the [[Battle of Gavere]] in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of [[Philip the Good]]. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the [[Low Countries]] started to shift from Flanders (Bruges–Ghent) to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] ([[Antwerp]]–[[Brussels]]), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two [[Flemish revolts against Maximilian of Austria|revolts against Maximilian of Austria]], the first monarch of the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule Flanders.

[[File:Joseph_working_02.gif|thumb|15th-century Ghent miniature of the Biblical [[Joseph]], showing daily life there]]
In 1500, [[Juana of Castile]] gave birth to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who became [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] and obliged the city's nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: ''"strop"'') around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called "''Stroppendragers''" (noose bearers). St. Bavo's Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby St. Bavo's Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for [[Kingdom of Spain|Royal Spanish]] troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.

The late 16th and 17th centuries brought devastation because of the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city [[Fall of Ghent|was captured]] by French forces during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] before being returned to the [[Austria|Empire of Austria]] under the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] following the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748. This part of [[Flanders]] became known as the [[Austrian Netherlands]] until the exile of the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]], the end of the French Revolutionary and later [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the peace treaties arrived at by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.

===19th century===
[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - Justitiepaleis, Ghent, Belgium, ca. 1895.jpg|left|thumb|The Palace of Justice in Ghent, {{circa|1895}}]]

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Ghent's textile industry flourished again. [[Lieven Bauwens]], having smuggled the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] and factory machine plans out of England, introduced the first mechanical [[Weaving machines|weaving machine]] on the [[European continent]] in 1800.

The [[Treaty of Ghent]], negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the [[War of 1812]] between Great Britain and the United States (the North American phase of the Napoleonic Wars). After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Ghent and [[Flanders]], previously ruled from the House of Habsburg in [[Vienna]] as the Austrian Netherlands, became a part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own [[Ghent University|university]] (1816)<ref name="visit.gent.be">[https://visit.gent.be/en/good-know/practical-information/why-ghent/ghent-over-centuries Ghent over the centuries: Concise history of a stubborn city]</ref> and a [[Ghent–Terneuzen Canal|new connection to the sea]] (1824–27).

After the [[Belgian Revolution]], with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed, and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1913)|world exhibition in Ghent]].<ref name="visit.gent.be"/> As a preparation for these festivities, the [[Sint-Pieters railway station]] was completed in 1912.

===20th century===
Ghent was occupied by the Germans in both World Wars but escaped severe destruction. The life of the people and the German invaders in Ghent during [[World War I]] is described by H. Wandt in "etappenleven te Gent".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wandt |first=Heinrich |date=1921 |title=Etappenleven te Gent : kantteekeningen bij de Duitsche ineenstorting / |url=https://lib.ugent.be/catalog/rug01:000978952 |access-date=12 July 2022 |website=lib.ugent.be}}</ref> In [[World War II]] the city was liberated by the British [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th "Desert Rats" Armoured Division]] and local Belgian fighters on 6 September 1944, with the northern suburbs and the industrial area cleared over the following days by the [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division]].

Ghent is home to many people of foreign origin and immigrants. The 2020 census<ref>{{cite web| url = https://gent.buurtmonitor.be| title = Jive}}</ref> revealed that 35.5% of the inhabitants had roots outside of Belgium and 15.3% had a non-Belgian nationality. Many neighbourhoods already have a minority-majority population, primarily in the north, east, and west of the city and some pockets in the south. Some examples are Brugse Poort, Dampoort, Rabot, Ledeberg, Nieuw Gent/UZ and the area around Sleepstraat (known for its many Turkish restaurants).

Much of the city's [[medieval]] architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. Its centre is a [[Pedestrian zone|carfree area]]. Highlights are [[St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent|St. Bavo's Cathedral]] with the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', the [[belfry of Ghent|belfry]], the [[Gravensteen castle]], and the splendid architecture along the old [[Graslei]] harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three [[béguinage]]s and numerous churches including St. Jacob's Church, [[Saint Nicholas Church, Ghent|St. Nicholas' Church]], [[Saint Michael's Church, Ghent|St. Michael's Church]] and [[St. Stefanus, Ghent|St. Stefanus' Church]].
[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|The well-known ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', a 15th-century painting by Hubert and Jan Van Eyck in [[St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent|St. Bavo's Cathedral]].]] 
In the 19th century Ghent's most famous architect, [[Louis Roelandt]], built the university hall Aula, the opera house, and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the ''[[Boekentoren]]'' or Book Tower) by [[Henry Van de Velde]]. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.

The beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]] in 1998 and 1999.

The [[Zebrastraat]], a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy, and culture, can also be found in Ghent.

[[Campo Santo, Ghent|Campo Santo]] is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.

One of the more notable pieces of [[contemporary architecture]] in Ghent is [[De Krook]], the new central library and media center, a collaboration between local firm Coussée and Goris and Catalan firm RCR Arquitectos.

Important museums in Ghent are the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent|Museum voor Schone Kunsten]] (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and many Flemish masters; the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|SMAK]] or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Andy Warhol]]; and the [[Design Museum Gent]] with masterpieces of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Le Corbusier]]. The [[Huis van Alijn]] (House of the Alijn family) was originally a [[beguinage]] and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The ''Museum voor Industriële Archeologie en Textiel'' or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The [[Ghent City Museum]] (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city's past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.

===Theatre===
[[NTGent]] is the city theatre of Ghent, a public institution known for its radical productions. The theatre company's home base is in the {{ill|Royal Dutch Theatre|nl| Koninklijke Nederlandse Schouwburg (Gent)}} (Koninklijke Nederlandse Schouwburg, or KNS), with a secondary location in the city at Minnemeers. The company also tours extensively.<ref name=hist>{{cite web | title=History | website=NTGent | date=28 March 2023 | url=https://www.ntgent.be/en/wie-zijn-we/geschiedenis | access-date=17 March 2024 | archive-date=18 March 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240318010947/https://www.ntgent.be/en/wie-zijn-we/geschiedenis | url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Restaurants and culinary traditions===
In Ghent and other regions of [[East Flanders]], bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a "mastel" (plural "mastellen"), which is basically a bagel. "Mastellen" are also called "[[Saint Hubert]] bread", because, on the Saint's feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against [[rabies]].

Other local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as [[Leonidas (chocolate)|Leonidas]], the [[cuberdon]]s or 'neuzekes' ('noses'), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies (a four-year feud between two local vendors made international news),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/a-tale-of-two-cuberdon-vendors-the-story-behind-ghents-little-nose-war/|title=A Tale of Two Cuberdon Vendors: The Story Behind Ghent's 'Little Nose War'|first=Nana|last=Van De Poel|date=22 July 2017}}</ref> 'babelutten' ('babblers'), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous 'Tierenteyn', a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French 'Dijon' mustard.

[[Carbonade flamande|Stoverij]] is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown [[Trappist beer|'Trappist']] (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. '[[Waterzooi]]' is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style and supplemented by a large pot on the side.

The city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called ''Donderdag Veggiedag''<ref>[http://www.vegetarisme.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=767 "Ghent's veggie day: for English speaking visitors"] on Vegetarisme.be</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm "Belgian city plans 'veggie' days"] on [[BBC News]] (12 May 2009).</ref> with [[vegetarian]] food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city-funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of "veggie street maps"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the [[Environmental effects of meat production#Fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions|detrimental environmental effects of meat production]], which the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

===Festivals and other events===
The city is host to some big cultural events such as the [[Gentse Feesten|Ghent Festival]], the [[Flanders International Film Festival Ghent|International Film Festival of Ghent]] (with the [[World Soundtrack Awards]]) and the {{Interlanguage link|Gent Festival van Vlaanderen|nl}}. Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (''Gentse Floraliën'') takes place in [[Flanders Expo]] in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.

The Ghent Festival (''Gentse Feesten'' in Dutch) is an annual festival that lasts for ten days. It has been held for more than 50 years (since 1969) and is attended by about 1–1.5 million visitors. It did not take place in 2020 and 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium]], being held again in the summer of 2022, after a two-year break.

The [[Festival of Flanders]] had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent, it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that take place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval [[inner city]] and some 250 international artists perform.

Ghent co-hosted the 2021 [[World Choir Games]] together with [[Antwerp]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interkultur.com/newsroom/choir-games/details/news/world-choir-games-kick-off-in-flanders/|title=World Choir Games kick off in Flanders|website=INTERKULTUR|date=15 September 2021 |access-date=18 October 2021}}</ref> Organised by the [[Interkultur Foundation]], the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.

Ghent has been chosen as the 2024 [[European Youth Capital]] by the [[European Youth Forum]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Verstichel |first1=Mathieu |title=Gent is Europese Jongerenhoofdstad in 2024: "Een volledig jaar focus op de jeugd" |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2021/11/19/gent-wordt-europese-jongerenhoofdstad-voor-een-jaar/ |access-date=15 March 2023 |work=VRT |date=19 November 2021 |language=Dutch}}</ref>

===Parks===
The numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions. Most notably, Ghent boasts a [[nature reserve]] ([[Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen]], {{convert|230|ha|acre|abbr=off}}<ref name="nature reserve">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgent.be/en/natuur-en-milieucentrum-de-bourgoyen |title=Nature Domain De Bourgoyen &#124; Visit Gent |publisher=visitgent.be|access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref>) and a recreation park (Blaarmeersen, 87 hectares; 215 acres).<ref name="inyourpocket">{{cite web|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/Belgium/Ghent/Sightseeing/Parks-and-Gardens/Blaarmeersen-Sport-and-Recreation-Park_102502v |title=Blaarmeersen Sport and Recreation Park – Sightseeing in Ghent |website=inyourpocket.com |access-date=18 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520042928/http://www.inyourpocket.com/Belgium/Ghent/Sightseeing/Parks-and-Gardens/Blaarmeersen-Sport-and-Recreation-Park_102502v |archive-date=20 May 2015}}</ref>

==Economy==
The [[port of Ghent]], in the north of the city, is the third-largest port of Belgium. It is accessed by the [[Ghent–Terneuzen Canal]], which ends near the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] port of [[Terneuzen]] on the [[Western Scheldt]]. The port houses, among others, large companies like [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Volvo Cars]], [[Volvo Trucks]], [[Volvo Parts]], [[Honda]], and [[Stora Enso]].

The [[Ghent University]] and several research-oriented companies, such as Ablynx, Innogenetics, Cropdesign, and Bayer Cropscience, are situated in the central and southern part of the city.

As the largest city in East Flanders, Ghent has four large hospitals, numerous schools, and shopping streets. [[Flanders Expo]], the biggest event hall in Flanders and the second biggest in Belgium, is also located in Ghent. Tourism is becoming a major employer in the local area.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 August 2020 |title=Ghent – Eurocities |url=https://eurocities.eu/cities/ghent/ |access-date=12 February 2024 |website=eurocities.eu |language=en-GB}}</ref>

International buses connecting Ghent to other European destinations are usually found at the Dampoort Station. A couple of private bus companies such as Eurolines, Megabus and Flixbus operate from the Dampoort bus hub.

Buses to and from Belgium's first ([[Brussels Airport]]) and second airport ([[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]]) are operated by Flibco, and can be found at the rear exit of the Sint-Pieters Station.

===Cycling===
Ghent has the largest designated cyclist area in Europe, with nearly {{convert|400|km}} of cycle paths and more than 700 one-way streets, where bikes are allowed to go against the traffic. It also boasts Belgium's first [[bicycle boulevard]], where cars are considered 'guests' and must stay behind cyclists.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In 2013, it began doing on-street surveys of bicycles, adding bicycle parking racks in neighbourhoods where they were needed. In 2017, the city changed traffic circulation patterns to favour cycling. The switch was done over the course of a single weekend, changing traffic circulation on over 80 streets and 2500 road signs. It expanded the car-free zone in the historic city center more than twofold. It also put in radial barriers to car traffic, thus shifting it onto the inner ring road.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ghent's history and future with cycling |url=https://ecf.com/news-and-events/news/ghents-history-and-future-cycling |website=ECF |language=en |date=29 August 2022}}</ref><ref>Youtube: Streetfilms, 2 January 2020: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEOA_Tcq2XA The Innovative Way Ghent, Belgium Removed Cars From The City]</ref>

More cyclists means a higher demand for [[bicycle parking station]]s. In 2010, the plans to renovate Gent-Sint-Pieters railway station included 10,000 bicycle parking spots.<ref>In Dutch: Project Gent Sint-Pieters, nieuwsbericht 9 November 2016:[http://www.projectgentsintpieters.be/archief/nieuwsberichten/detail/2000-bijkomende-fietsenstallingen 2000 bijkomende fietsenstallingen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128025320/https://www.projectgentsintpieters.be/archief/nieuwsberichten/detail/2000-bijkomende-fietsenstallingen |date=28 January 2020 }}</ref> In 2020, several sections of the underground parking facilities have been built, and the targets have been adjusted to a total of 17,000 parking spots.<ref>In Dutch: Project Gent Sint-Pieters: Voorstelling project, Stationsproject: [http://www.projectgentsintpieters.be/voorstelling-project/stationsproject/fiets Fiets], site bezocht op 28 January 2020</ref>
