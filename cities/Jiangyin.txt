'''Jiangyin''' ({{zh|s=江阴|t=江陰|p=Jiāngyīn|w=Chiangyin}}, [[Jiangyin dialect]]: {{IPA-wuu|kɐ̞ŋ.jɪŋ|}}) is a [[county-level city]] on the southern bank of the [[Yangtze River]], and is administered by [[Wuxi]], [[Jiangsu]] province. Jiangyin is one of the most important transport hubs on the Yangtze River, it is also one of the most developed counties in China. With 1,595,138 inhabitants as of the 2010 census,[1] the city is now part of Jiangyin-Zhangjiagang-Jingjiang built-up or metropolitan area with 3,526,260 inhabitants

== Etymology ==
Jiangyin's name means "River Shade", from its location on the south or shady side of the Yangtze River.

==History==
[[File:City of jiangyin in 1840.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The walled city of Jiangyin in 1840]]
Jiangyin was a township of Yanling ({{lang|zh-hant|延陵}}; later known as Piling, {{lang|zh-hant|毗陵}}) county initially. Since the township was located in the north of Ji Lake, it was given the name "'''Jiyang'''" ({{lang|zh-hant|暨陽}}). In 281, it was promoted as a county of Piling commandery. In 558,  the north-west part was taken away from then Lanling county ([[Wujin District|Wujin]] and its around areas) to create '''Jiangyin''' county. It was served as the seat of Jiangyin commandery, of which jurisdiction equating to the modern city's, until the commandery was dissolved in 589. It was elevated to ''jun'' (military prefecture) status during Southern Tang, until being restored as a county of Changzhou in 1071. It developed as an important port for overseas trades, and a Maritime Trade Supervisorate ({{lang|zh-hant|市舶提擧司}}) was established to manage in 1145. The county became a ''zhou'' (smaller prefecture) during Yuan dynasty, but was reduced to county status again in 1367.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=中国历史大辞典·历史地理卷|publisher=Shanghai Cishu Press|year=1996|isbn=7-5326-0299-0|pages=350–1|language=zh|trans-title=The Great Encyclopaedia of Chinese History, Volume on Historical Geography}}</ref>

In 1472, the sandbank in the Yangtze River was independent from the county to establish [[Jingjiang|Jingjiang county]].{{sfnp|Cheng|1992|p=14}} In 1645, the draconian enforcement of the decree adopting the [[Manchu]] hair style and dress inflamed the local Han Chinese people's spirit to resist. Since the ultimatum "either lose your hair or lose your head" was given, they held the walled city against Qing sieges under a magistrate [[Yan Yingyuan]] ({{lang|zh-hant|[[:zh:閻應元|閻應元]]}}) 's leadership.{{sfnp|Cheng|1992|p=15}}

On 23 April 1987, Jiangyin was approved by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of China]] to become a county-level city.{{sfnp|Cheng|1992|p=1383}}

==Administrative divisions==
