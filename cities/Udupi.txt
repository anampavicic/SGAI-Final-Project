==History==
In the 13th century, [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] saint [[Madhvacharya]] founded the [[Udupi Sri Krishna Matha|Sri Krishna Temple]].<ref name="Tumbe" /> He set up eight ''[[matha]]s'' - [[Ashta Mathas of Udupi|Ashta Mathas]] in Udupi to propagate the [[Dvaita Vedanta]] philosophy, and this caused a vibrant temple culture to take root in present-day [[Udupi district]].<ref name="Tumbe" /> Significant migration of [[Brahmin]]s to the region took place subsequently, and they came to comprise 10 per cent of the region's population, three times higher than elsewhere in [[South India]].<ref name="Tumbe">Chinmay Tumbe, ''India Moving: A History of Migration'' (2019), p.42</ref>

== Cuisine ==
{{Main|Udupi cuisine}}
[[File:Masala Dosa (27429188304).jpg|thumb|right|[[Masala dosa]] is a part of Udupi cuisine.]]
The origin of this cuisine is linked to Krishna Matha (Mutt). Lord Krishna is offered food of different varieties every day, and there are certain restrictions on ingredients during Chaturmasa (a four-month period during the monsoon season). These restrictions coupled with the requirement of variety led to innovation, especially in dishes incorporating seasonal and locally available materials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newskarnataka.com/udupi/jackfruit-mela-2015-brings-jackfruit-lovers-together |title='Jackfruit Mela-2015' brings Jackfruit lovers together |website=www.newskarnataka.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126104950/http://www.newskarnataka.com/udupi/jackfruit-mela-2015-brings-jackfruit-lovers-together |archive-date=2016-01-26}}</ref> This cuisine was developed by [[Shivalli]] Madhwa Brahmins who cooked food for Lord Krishna, and at Krishna Matha in Udupi, the food is provided free of cost. Restaurants specialised in Udupi cuisine can be seen widely in most metropolitan and large cities around the length and breadth of India.

Although popular for its vegetarian cuisine, Udupi has its fair share of non-vegetarian dishes that are similar to Mangalorean cuisine. Some of these include Kori Roti, Kori Pulimunchi, Chicken Sukka, Fish Curry, Fish Fry and more.

== Economy ==
Udupi is becoming a major town in Karnataka. Udupi is the birthplace of the [[Syndicate Bank]], [[Corporation Bank]] and Harsha Retail, the leading retailer of coastal Karnataka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://syndicatebank.in/scripts/aboutus.aspx |title=Brief history of Syndicate Bank |access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corpbank.com/asp/0100text.asp?presentID=1176&headID=994 |title=History of Corporation Bank |access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> Udupi's economy also consists of agriculture and fishing. Small-scale industries like the [[cashew]] industry, and other food industries and milk cooperatives are the most prominent. Recently, Udupi is also making its mark in the real estate industry, greatly influenced by its neighboring spearhead [[Mangalore]].

The [[Karnataka]] government had signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) with the Cogentrix Light and Power Industry to set up a thermal power plant in the district at [[Nandikur]]. However, because of stiff opposition from citizens and environmentalist groups, the project has been temporarily suspended. An attempt by the Nagarjuna Power Corporation to set up a similar plant at nearby [[Padubidri]] also met strong opposition. Now, the power plant has been set up, generating 1,200 MW of power under the name of Udupi Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), a subsidiary of Lanco Infra, an Andhra Pradesh-based infrastructure major.
