'''Tocuyito''' is a city of [[Venezuela]], capital of the [[Libertador Municipality, Carabobo|Libertador Municipality]] in [[Carabobo State]]. It is part of the metropolitan area of [[Valencia (Venezuela)|Valencia]]. This city is considered the entry point to Valencia from the motorways that lead to the Southwest (Barquisimeto) and South (towards Cojedes).

==Geography==
Tocuyito is located in the flatlands of Carabobo, at an altitude of 451 metres above sea level. Its annual temperature is around 26[[°C]].

==History==
Tocuyito was founded in 1547 by Spanish Conquistador Juan de Villegas. The name derives from its initial similarity to the town of [[El Tocuyo]] (Tocuyito is little Tocuyo). '''Tocuyo''' is an Indian word for "[[maniok]] juice".{{cn|date=March 2023}} 

Southwest of the town is where the 1821 [[Battle of Carabobo]] took place, resulting in a joint Venezuelan-Colombian victory against the Spanish Army.

There was an important battle in Tocuyito on 14 September 1899, when the so-called Revolution for Liberal Restoration, led by [[Cipriano Castro]], decisively defeated the governmental forces of president [[Ignacio Andrade]].
