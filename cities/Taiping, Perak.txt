'''Taiping''' ({{IPA-ms|taipeŋ|lang}}, [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: {{lang|ms-Arab|تاءيڤيڠ}}; {{lang-zh|t=太平}}, {{IPA|cmn|tʰaɪ̯⁵¹piŋ|lang}}, [[Penang Hokkien|Hokkien]]: Thài-pêng; {{langx|ta|தைப்பிங்}}) is a town located in [[Larut, Matang and Selama District]], [[Perak]], [[Malaysia]]. It is located approximately {{Convert|48|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Ipoh]], the capital of [[Perak]], and {{Convert|78|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]]. With a population of 245,182 (in 2013),<ref>[http://pdttaiping.perak.gov.my/index.php?bhg=geografi&isi=statistik&id=1 Senarai Mukim dan Statistik Penduduk]</ref> it is the second largest town in Perak after [[Ipoh]], the state capital.

Taiping took over [[Kuala Kangsar]]'s role as the state capital from 1876 to 1937, but was then replaced by Ipoh.<ref>Malaysian States http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Malay_states.htm</ref> Its growth slowed after that, but in recent years the town has been developing rapidly again. [[Perak State Museum]] is located in the town.

Taiping also receives some limelight for being the wettest town in [[Peninsular Malaysia]].<ref>Newspapers recorded Taiping as the wettest place in Malaya in March 1937, with a rainfall of 21.55 inches, and Maxwell's Hill next to it with 16.01 inches. Comparatively, Kuala Lumpur's rainfall was just 6.39 inches (The Straits Times, 24 April 1937, Page 12).; In 1959, The Straits Times (The Straits Times, 2 April 1959, Page 7) reported, 'Water was rationed 39 days last year in Taiping, the wettest town in Malaya. 'Taiping's Larut Hills record the highest annual average total of 5800 mm rain (Cranbrook, Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, ed. Malaysia:key Environments. Oxford: Published in Collaboration with the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources by Pergamon, 1988. Print. Page 7).</ref> {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Its average annual rainfall of about 4,000&thinsp;mm has led to fertile flora and [[Albizia saman|rain trees]] in the [[Taiping Lake Gardens]].

Taiping was ranked in the Top 3 Sustainable Cities in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=LOH |first=IVAN |title=Taiping is No 3 most sustainable city in the world |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/03/07/taiping-is-no-3-most-sustainable-city-in-the-world |access-date=2022-03-19 |website=The Star |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Larut War}}
The area developed quickly in the 19th century when [[tin]] was discovered. The mines attracted large numbers of settlers, particularly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. Feuds began between the different groups of Chinese immigrants and became so bitter that in the early 1870s, the British intervened and assumed control of the town.<ref>See pages 86–88, Chapter 8 Malaysian Confrontations, Send A Gunboat: The Victorian Navy and Supremacy at Sea, 1854–1904, by Antony Preston & John Major, Conway, an imprint of Anova Books Ltd, London, UK, 2007 Revised Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-85177-923-2}}</ref> Taiping was the capital for the districts of [[Larut, Matang and Selama]] in Perak. Before 1937, Taiping was the capital of the state of Perak and the centre of a long and drawn out war resulting in a change of rulership for the state. Taiping used to be known as Klian Pauh – ''Klian'' meaning mine while ''Pauh'' is a type of small mango.

[[File:St. George's Institution, Malaysia 2.jpg|thumb|[[St. George's Institution, Malaysia|St. George's Institution]], a colonial boys' school established in 1915.]]
Long Jaafar has been historically credited with the discovery of tin in Larut in 1848. According to legend, Long Jaafar had an elephant named Larut and he used to take this elephant with him when journeying between [[Bukit Gantang]] and Lubok Merbau. One day the elephant went missing and when the elephant was eventually found three days later Long Jaafar noticed tin ore embedded in the mud that was on the elephant's legs. It is said that this was how Larut got its name.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wahab |first=Farid |date=31 May 2022 |title=Delving into cultural roots of north Perak |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2022/05/31/delving-into-cultural-roots-of-north-perak |website=The Star Online}}</ref>

Eventually in 1850, Larut district was bestowed upon Long Jaafar by Raja Muda Ngah Ali and the Chiefs of Perak: the Temenggong, Panglima Bukit Gantang, Panglima Kinta, Syahbandar and Seri Adika Raja. Some time later, the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, died in 1857 and a series of succession disputes ensued. Unhappy with the abuse and favouritism of various royalties, rival Malay camps took sides with one or the other of the two great Chinese secret societies present in there at the time. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Long Jaafar established and developed his administrative centre at [[Bukit Gantang]] and made Kuala Sungai Limau at Trong the principal harbour of the Larut Settlement. In 1857 Long Jaafar was succeeded by his son Ngah Ibrahim. Sultan Jaffar Muazzam Shah presented an acknowledgement letter to Ngah Ibrahim on 24 May 1858. This letter was signed by Sultan Jaffar, Raja Muda Ngah Ali and the Raja Bendahara of Perak. In the time of [[Ngah Ibrahim]] the Chinese increased in number and by early 1860 two large groups were formed by the Chinese, the "Five Associations" whose members worked in the mines of Klian Pauh and the "Four Associations" whose members worked in the mines of [[Kamunting|Klian Baharu]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Mining rights were given to the Hakka "Five Associations" or Go-Kuan (五館 or 五群) and the Cantonese "Four Associations" or Si-Kuan (四館). [[Chung Keng Quee]] (鄭景貴) was leader of the Hakka Go-Kuan and the Hai San (海山) society that they belonged to, and began to operate his tin mines in Larut in 1860. Larut was destined to be plagued by four major wars between members of both the Cantonese Go-Kuan [[Ghee Hin]] Society (義興私會黨) and the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] society. Many [[Hakka people|Hakka]] had fled China when the [[Taiping Rebellion]] broke out there and found work in the mines of [[Chung Keng Quee]] establishing his position over the mining area in Larut as leader of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] from 1860 to 1884.

The capital of Perak was moved from Bandar Baru (New Town) to Taiping after Datok Maharaja Lela assassinated the first [[British Resident]] of Perak Mr. [[James Wheeler Woodford Birch]] at [[Pasir Salak]] in 1875. In 1937, the capital of Perak was moved from Taiping to [[Ipoh]].

The town's mining industry continued to thrive; the country's first railway was built to transport tin from Taiping to Port Weld (now known as Kuala Sepetang) at the coast for export. The first train in Malaysia took its schedule on 1 June 1885.<ref>The Straits Times, 31 August 1931, Page 6
</ref>

By 1900, an English language school,<ref>Straits Times Weekly Issue, 12 November 1890, Page 3</ref> a newspaper,<ref>The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884–1942), 28 April 1894, Page 11</ref> and the Perak Museum (the oldest in Malaysia) had been established.<ref>The Straits Times, 6 March 1889, Page 2</ref>

Although Taiping's economy declined with the dwindling tin deposits, [[tin mining]] remains an important industry in the area, as do rubber and rice.

==Geography==
[[File:Taiping 2.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Taiping]]
[[File:taiping-night-view.jpg|thumb|Night view of Taiping]]
Taiping lies 23m above sea level situated on a plain to the west of the [[Bintang Mountains]]. [[Perak]]'s capital city, [[Ipoh]], is approximately {{Convert|48|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the town, while [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], the capital city of the neighbouring state of [[Penang]], lies {{Convert|78|km|abbr=on}} away to the northwest.

===Climate===
Taiping also receives some limelight for being the wettest town in Peninsular Malaysia even on the driest month. In June, the town still receives {{convert|159|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall. The average annual rainfall is about {{convert|3200|mm|abbr=on}} in Taiping while the peninsula's average is {{convert|2000|mm|abbr=on}}–{{convert|2500|mm|abbr=on}}. Its unusual rainfall has also led to a fertile collection of flora and century-old rain trees in the Taiping Lake Gardens.

==Transportation==

===Rail===
[[File:Taiping Railway Station.JPG|thumb|[[Taiping railway station]]]]
[[Taiping railway station]] was the first operational train station in Malaysia. Originally, the station served the local tin mines, transporting ore to Port Weld (now [[Kuala Sepetang]]) and mine workers to their dedicated settlements. In the 1930s, railway connections to major towns like [[Ipoh]], Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore started.  The Taiping-Port Weld line was dismantled by [[Malayan Railway|KTMB]] in the 1980s.<ref name="Landasan Keretapi Pertama">{{cite web | title = Landasan Keretapi Yang Pertama di Tanah Melayu | url = http://www.pnm.my/yangpertama/Auto_Landasan.htm | access-date = 1 December 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090423073934/http://www.pnm.my/yangpertama/Auto_Landasan.htm | archive-date = 23 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Malayan Railways 100 years">''Malayan Railways 100 years 1885 – 1995''</ref>

The station was previously served only by [[KTM Intercity]] trains, with a one-way trip to [[KL Sentral]] taking about six hours. Since 1 July 2015, the station is also served by [[KTM ETS]]'s ETS Ekspres service, reducing travel times on the same route to about three hours. Taiping is also a stop on the ETS Transit service between [[Ipoh railway station|Ipoh]] and [[Padang Besar railway station|Padang Besar]]. The station is also served by the [[KTM Komuter Northern Sector]].

=== Bus ===
