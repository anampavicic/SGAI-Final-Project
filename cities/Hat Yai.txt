'''Hat Yai''' ({{langx|th|หาดใหญ่}}, {{IPA|th|hàːt jàj|pron}}, also '''Haad Yai''' or '''Had Yai''') is a city in [[southern Thailand]] near the [[Malaysia]]n border and the [[List of municipalities in Thailand#Largest cities by urban population|fifth-largest city]] in [[Thailand]] with a population of 191,696 (2024) in the [[Thesaban|city municipality]] (''thesaban nakhon'' / [[city proper]]) itself and an [[Urban area|urban population]] of 404,044 (2021) in the entire district of [[Hat Yai district|Amphoe Hat Yai]]. 

Hat Yai is the largest city of [[Songkhla province]] and is part of the '''Greater Hat Yai-Songkhla Metropolitan Area''' (a [[conurbation]] with a population of about 800,000), forming the largest metropolitan area in the south, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area of the country. The city is often mistaken for being the provincial capital. In fact, [[Songkhla]] is the capital and the center of administration and culture while Hat Yai is the business center.

==History==
Originally named Khok Samet Chun (โคกเสม็ดชุน, "[[Syzygium antisepticum|shore eugenia]] knoll"), Hat Yai was a small village until the southern railway was built there, making it one of the major rail hubs of the time. The junction which connected the town of Songkhla with the main route was formerly in the U Tapao area, but was later moved to Khok Samet Chun in 1922 when the U Tapao area turned out to be flood-prone. At that time, Khok Samet Chun had only four residents, but thanks to the investments of Khun [[Niphat Chinnakorn]] (the railway contractor for the railway line from [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] to [[Pattani (town)|Pattani]]) it quickly grew into a small town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southern Thailand's other revolution |url=https://www.newmandala.org/southern-thailands-other-revolution/ |website=New Mandala |access-date=30 November 2023 |language=en-AU |date=30 October 2012}}</ref>

In 1928, Hat Yai was made a community (''chumchon''), which was upgraded to a sanitary district (''[[sukhaphiban]]'') on December 11, 1935. It covered an area of {{cvt|4.4|km2}}, and was administered by the first mayor, Udom Bunlong. In 1938, the municipal administration building was completed. On March 16, 1949, Hat Yai was granted town status (''[[thesaban mueang]]''). On May 10, 1961, the area covered by the municipality was increased to {{cvt|8|km2}}. As a result of the town's continuing growth, on August 13, 1968, a larger, new municipal administration building was opened. On April 24, 1977, the total area of the municipality was enlarged for the second time to {{cvt|21|km2}}. Finally, in 1995, the town was upgraded to city status (''[[thesaban nakhon]]'').<ref>{{cite journal |date=24 September 1995 |title=พระราชกฤษฎีกา จัดตั้งเทศบาลนครหาดใหญ่ จังหวัดสงขลา พ.ศ.๒๕๓๘|trans-title=Royal Decree Establishing Hat Yai city municipality, Songkhla province, B.E.2538 (1995) |url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2538/A/040/19.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110201455/http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2538/A/040/19.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 10, 2011|access-date=10 March 2020 |journal=Royal Thai Government Gazette |volume=112 |issue=40 Kor |pages=19–23 |postscript=, effectively on 25 September 1995}}</ref> There are a total of 102 communities (''chumchon''), divided into 4 zones.

The name "Hat Yai" is a short version of "mahat yai", meaning big mahat ({{langx|th|มะหาด}}) tree, a relative of [[jackfruit]]s in genus ''[[Artocarpus]]''.

==Southern violence==
{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}

As the major economic center of lower southern Thailand, Hat Yai has increasingly become a target of terrorism in the separatist campaign conducted by the [[Patani United Liberation Organisation]] and similar radical groups.

On April 3, 2005, [[2005 Songkhla bombings|bomb attacks]] were carried out at a [[Carrefour]] Hypermarket and [[Hat Yai International Airport]], killing two and injuring dozens.

On September 16, 2006, a [[2006 Hat Yai bombings|series of bomb attacks]] killed four and injured more than 70. Although no group has claimed responsibility, [[South Thailand insurgency|local separatists]] are presumed to have been responsible.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5353648.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Four killed in Thai bomb blasts | date=September 17, 2006 | access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

On March 31, 2012, a [[2012 Southern Thailand bombings|car bomb]] exploded in the Lee Gardens Plaza Hotel, killing at least 5 and injuring hundreds. Both Thai nationals and Malaysian tourists were among the victims. The Royal Thai Army believes that members of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN)
group carried out the terrorist attack.

==Shopping==
[[File:Hat Yai.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right| The central area of Hat Yai city]]
[[File:Hat Yai, historic shop houses on Napatuthit 1 Rd.jpg|thumb|Historic [[Shophouse|shophouses]] in Hat Yai]]
Hat Yai has a reputation for being a shopping destination for both Thais and foreigners. There are numbers of department stores, shopping malls and markets throughout the city. Suntisook Market on Nipat U-tid 1, 2 & 3 roads are among the best-known. Their main products are imported processed food, cosmetics, fabrics, gadgets and electrical appliances. The city's major wet market is located near the railway station. And another one is Kim Yong market on Supasarn Rungsan road.

Kim Yong market (also Gim Yong) is a famous market located in the center of Hat Yai, Songkhla. The market is divided into 2 parts. The first part is a 2-floor building previously called the “Chaloemthai” cinema. The second part is an outdoor market, alongside the road.

The goods in this market are varied and each part of the market is different. On the first floor of the building, there are fresh foods, such as vegetables, meats, certain seafood, groceries, clothes, snacks, and dry foodstuffs. It is well known that Kim Yong Market has many kinds of dry foodstuffs from China and snacks like chocolates and chips from Malaysia. On the second floor, there are electric appliances which are made in Thailand and China. All of these imported goods are inexpensive because they are tax-free. Outside of the building, many shops and stalls can be found along small streets. Most of the shops sell batiks from Malaysia and Indonesia and Muslim clothes while the majority of stalls sell foods and fruits. Moreover, chestnut is another popular product, which visitors prefer to buy. They can notice chestnut stalls easily by the man who roasts the chestnut and by the smell.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hat Yai - Songkhla Province - Thailand - Story and images of Chinese New Year in Hat Yai, Thailand, 2007. |url=https://www.sailing-story.com/hat-yai-thailand.php |website=www.sailing-story.com |access-date=30 November 2023}}</ref>

Because of the variety of goods in this market, it is able to attract a large number of people, not only local people but also foreigners and travelers.{{cn|date=February 2024}}
 
The city has two large weekend markets, namely Asian Trade and Greenway, which are both located on Kanchanavanit Road. They mainly sell second-hand products, including clothes, shoes, decor and souvenirs. In addition, there are several large shopping centers in the city, including Diana, Odean, Robinson, Central, Siam Nakharin, Big C, Big C Extra, Tesco Lotus and Makro. By the end of 2013, Central Festival, one of the largest shopping centers in Southern Thailand.

==Culture==
An important Buddhist temple is Hat Yai Nai Temple or Wat Hat Yai Nai. It is home to the third largest reclining statue on the planet. People travel from all over Thailand just to pay respect to this statue.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Held on the first night of October, [[Chak Phra]] is a Buddhist festival specific to the south of Thailand. It is celebrated with Buddha boat processions or sports events like a run up Khao Tang Kuan hill. In September or October at the Chinese Lunar festival, the Thai and Chinese present their offerings to the moon, "queen of the heavens", in gratitude for past and future fortunes.

Hat Yai is also well known for its spectacular celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year]] festival. Although Thai elements have been incorporated (for example, Thai pop stars have been invited to perform), the celebration remains distinctively Chinese. “Despite being several generations removed from Hat Yai's original Chinese pioneers, the New Year celebration provides strong evidence that the community is still influenced by and strongly identifies with its Chinese roots.<ref>Robert Cummings, “ Examining the Continuity of Chinese Cultural Characteristics of the Thai-Chinese Community in Hat Yai Through the Chinese New Year Festival,” ''Rian Thai : International Journal of Thai Studies'' 9 (2016), 169–202 (201).</ref><gallery>
