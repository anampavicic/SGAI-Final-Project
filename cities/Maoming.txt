==Etymology==
The city is named after [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] [[Taoist]] scholar and doctor {{ill|Pan Maoming|zh|潘茂名}} (290&ndash;371), born in [[Gaozhou]]. The local area was renamed by imperial decree in honour of Pan in 598 A.D. during the [[Sui dynasty]].

==History==
During the early development of Chinese civilization in the [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Yellow River]] valleys and across the [[North China Plain]], the area around Maoming was held by the [[Baiyue]]. After the [[Qin Empire|Qin]] [[Qin invasion of Guangdong|invaded]] in the late 3rd century{{nbsp}}BC, the area was divided into Nanhai, Xiang, and Guilin. {{nowrap|'''Maoming County'''}} was established {{circa|lk=no|600}} under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]]. In September1950, Maoming County was affiliated with the Gaolei Administrative Region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maoming, city with time-honored history |url=http://guangdong.chinadaily.com.cn/maoming/2021-11/22/c_450596.htm |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=guangdong.chinadaily.com.cn}}</ref> Under the [[Qing Empire|Qing]], it comprised part of [[Gaozhou]] [[Fu (administrative division)|Prefecture]].<ref name=gutzy>{{citation |last=Gützlaff |first=Charles |author-link=Karl Gützlaff |editor=Andrew Reed |display-editors=0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5AAAAAcAAJ |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5AAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA527 527] |title=China Opened |year=1838 }}.</ref> Following the [[Chinese Civil War]], Maoming became the primary community in the area and was raised to [[county-level city]] status in 1959.

In 2014, the city was the site of popular protests against [[p-Xylene]], a chemical based on [[benzene]] that was being produced by local industry.<ref name=luoma/> Since the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th Party Congress]] and the ascension of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], Maoming has been one of the "hardest hit" areas of the [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]]. It was seen as a city where buying and selling official positions was rampant. The 2014 investigation by central inspection authorities found that some 159 local officials had taken various forms of bribes.<ref name=neta>{{cite news |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:广东茂名买官价目表:副区长为转正送30万美金 |url=http://news.163.com/14/0817/04/A3QRR32E0001124J.html |publisher=Netease |date=August 17, 2014 |access-date=29 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820090506/http://news.163.com/14/0817/04/A3QRR32E0001124J.html |archive-date=20 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The former [[Party Committee Secretary|Communist Party Secretary]] of Maoming, [[Zhou Zhenhong]], was [[death penalty in China|sentenced to death]] with a two-year reprieve for corruption in relation to the p-Xylene scandal.

==Demographics==
The prefecture includes a large number of [[Chinese minorities|minority groups]], including the [[Yao people|Yao]], [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], and [[Miao people|Miao]], giving it diverse cultural activities and folk arts. The people of southern Maoming speak a [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect brought by Putianese immigrants which is especially closely related to the [[Leizhou dialect]] while the people of northern Maoming speak the [[Gaoyang dialect]] of [[Cantonese]], as well as [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. In addition, [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] dialect is also spoken by a certain percentage of the Maoming people.

==Administration==
The [[prefecture-level city]] of Maoming administers 5 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including 2 [[District of China|districts]] and 3 [[county-level city|county-level cities]].
