'''Bangsamoro''', officially the '''Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao''' (BARMM; {{langx|fil|Rehiyong Awtonomo ng Bangsamoro sa Muslim Mindanao}}; {{langx|ar|{{Script/Arabic|منطقة باڠسامورو ذاتية الحكم في مينداناو المسلمة}}}}, ''Minṭaqah Banjisāmūrū dhātiyyah al-ḥukm''), is an [[Autonomous regions of the Philippines|autonomous region]] in the [[Philippines]], located in the southwestern portion of the island of [[Mindanao]].

Replacing the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), the BARMM was formed with the ratification of its basic law, the [[Bangsamoro Organic Law]], following a [[2019 Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite|two-part legally binding plebiscite in Western Mindanao]] held on January 21 and February 6, 2019. The ratification was confirmed a few days later on January 25 by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC).

The establishment of Bangsamoro was the culmination of several years of peace talks between the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] and several autonomist groups; in particular the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF), which rejected the validity of the ARMM and called for the creation of a region with more powers devolved from the national government. A framework agreement known as the [[Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro]] was negotiated between the national government and the MILF in 2014. After continued negotiations and debates over certain provisions, the Congress of the Philippines created and ratified a basic law for the region, now referred to as the [[Bangsamoro Organic Law]]; the bill was signed into law on July 26, 2018.

Despite questions on the region's constitutionality, as it would have adopted a [[parliamentary system]] in an area of a country with a [[presidential system]] of government, no judicial ruling was made against the organic law and consequently a two-part [[2019 Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite|plebiscite]] was held: one by ARMM citizens determining whether to dissolve the ARMM and immediately replace it with the Bangsamoro and, following the approval on the first part,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Depasupil|first1=William|author2=TMT|last3=Reyes|first3=Dempsey|title='Yes' vote prevails in 4 of 5 provinces|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/01/23/news/top-stories/yes-vote-prevails-in-4-of-5-provinces/500640/500640/|access-date=January 23, 2019|work=The Manila Times|date=January 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Galvez|first1=Daphne|title=Zubiri: Overwhelming 'yes' vote for BOL shows Mindanao shedding its history of conflict|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1076036/zubiri-overwhelming-yes-vote-for-bol-shows-mindanao-shedding-its-history-of-conflict|access-date=January 22, 2019|work=Inquirer.net|date=January 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Esguerra|first1=Christian V.|title=New era dawns for Bangsamoro as stronger autonomy law ratified|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/25/19/new-era-dawns-for-bangsamoro-as-stronger-autonomy-law-ratified|access-date=January 25, 2018|work=ABS-CBN News|date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> a second part taken by neighboring municipalities and barangays in the provinces of Lanao del Norte and Cotabato regarding their cession to the Bangsamoro region.<ref name="21ahoy" /><ref name="rejectsix">{{cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1082784/no-wins-in-13-lanao-del-norte-towns-yes-wins-in-only-9-towns|title='No' wins in 13 Lanao del Norte towns; 'Yes' wins in only 9 towns|first=Divina|last=Suson|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|date=February 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Jennings|first1=Ralph|title=Historic Autonomy Deal for Philippine Muslims Takes Aim at 50 Years of Strife|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/autonomy-philippine-muslims/4502200.html|access-date=July 28, 2018|work=Voice of America|date=July 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Esguerra|first1=Anthony Q.|title=EU expresses support for Bangsamoro Organic Law|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1015043/eu-expresses-support-for-bangsamoro-organic-law|access-date=July 28, 2018|work=Inquirer.net|date=July 27, 2018}}</ref> As a result of the second part of the plebiscite, 63 barangays of Cotabato province were handed over to the Bangsamoro government, adding to the autonomous region's territory.<ref name="63ahoy">{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/222984-plebiscite-results-number-of-barangays-cotabato-join-bangsamoro-region|title=63 out of 67 barangays in Cotabato to join Bangsamoro region|first=Carmela|last=Fonbuena|website=Rappler|date=February 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name="21ahoy">{{cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1082718/21-of-67-villages-in-north-cotabato-join-barmm|title=21 of 67 villages in North Cotabato join BARMM|first=Bong S.|last=Sarmiento|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|date=February 7, 2019}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The recently coined term Bangsamoro is derived from the [[Old Malay]] word ''bangsa'' ("[[Race (human categorization)|race]]" or "nation") and ''[[Moro people|Moro]]'' (the collective term for the various predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in the Philippines, from Spanish ''moro'', "[[Moors|Moor]]"<ref name="thirteen ethnic groups">{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/39098/who-are-the-moro-people|title=Who are the Moro people?|author=Jamail A.

===Early history and arrival of Islam===
[[File:Moro Sultanates (Philippines).png|thumb|Approximate historical extent of the Muslim sultanates of [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]], [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Maguindanao]] and Lanao]]
For the most part of Philippines' history, the region and most of [[Mindanao]] have been a separate territory, which enabled it to develop its own culture and identity. The westernmost and west-central areas have been the traditional homeland of [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim Filipinos]] since the 15th century, even before the arrival of the Spanish, who began to colonize most of the Philippines in 1565. Majority of Mindanao was the homeland of indigenous [[Lumad]] groups, who were neither [[Christians]] nor [[Muslim]]s.

Muslim [[missionaries]] arrived in [[Tawi-Tawi]] in 1380 and started the colonization of the area and the conversion of the native population to [[Islam]]. In 1457, the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] was founded, and not long after that, the sultanates of [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Maguindanao]] and [[Sultanate of Buayan|Buayan]] were also established. At the time when most of the Philippines was under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]], these sultanates maintained their independence and regularly challenged Spanish domination of the Philippines by conducting raids on Spanish coastal towns in the north and repulsing repeated Spanish incursions in their territory. It was not until the last quarter of the 19th century that the Sultanate of Sulu formally recognized Spanish [[suzerainty]], but these areas remained loosely controlled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements in [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]] and [[Cotabato (historical province)|Cotabato]],<ref>[http://www.philippineupdate.com/frjun.htm Mindanao Peace Process], Fr. Eliseo R. Mercado, Jr., OMI.</ref> until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]].

The [[Moro people|Moro]]s had a history of resistance against Spanish, American, and Japanese rule for over 400 years. The violent armed struggle against the [[Moros during World War II|Japanese]], [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|Filipinos]], [[Spanish–Moro Wars|Spanish]], and [[Moro Rebellion|Americans]] is considered by modern Moro Muslim leaders as part of the four centuries long "national liberation movement" of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation), although the term is only used in mainland Mindanao as those in the [[Sulu archipelago]] had a much distinct culture.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/1921767/Al_Harakatul_Al_Islamiyyah_Essays_on_the_Abu_Sayyaf_Group_by_Rommel_Banlaoi Banlaoi 2012], p. 24.</ref> The 400-year-long resistance against the Japanese, Americans, and Spanish by the Moro Muslims persisted and morphed into a war for independence against the Philippine state.<ref>[https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/f54ece77-3d67-4c32-bfaa-02b476a569d8/Maritime-Terrorism-in-Southeast-Asia--The-Abu-Sayy Banlaoi 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210125358/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/f54ece77-3d67-4c32-bfaa-02b476a569d8/Maritime-Terrorism-in-Southeast-Asia--The-Abu-Sayy |date=February 10, 2016 }}, p. 68.</ref>

The Filipinos in the northern and central Philippines either volunteered or were forced to surrender the existing city-states to become a part of the Spanish regime except for the islands occupied by the Muslims in the southern Philippines. The three-century rule of the Spaniards did not result in the full conquest of the archipelago due to the resistance of the Moros. The violence and brutality of the Spaniards in their attempts to suppress the Moro groups have resulted in killing numerous families and setting villages on fire.<ref name="auto">Kapahi, A.

The United States' [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands]] had only been in existence for two years in 1903 when it initiated the "Homestead Program," which was meant to encourage migration of landless populations from non-Muslim areas of the country into the Muslim-majority areas in Mindanao. [[Lanao (province)|Lanao]] and [[Cotabato]] in particular saw an influx of migrants from [[Luzon]] and [[Visayas]]. This influx of migrants led to tensions about land ownership and disenfranchisement of Lumads and Muslims, because the mostly-Christian migrants established claims on the land, whereas the native peoples of Mindanao didn't have a land titling system in place at the time. This US-led ''Homestead Program,'' which was later continued or copied by Philippine administrations after independence, is therefore often cited as one of the root-causes of what would later become the larger [[Moro conflict]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Damien Kingsbury|author2=Senior Lecturer in International Development Damien Kingsbury|author3=Costas Laoutides|title=Territorial Separatism in Global Politics: Causes, Outcomes and Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxXwBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55|date=March 5, 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63139-2|page=55}}</ref>

In 1942, during the early stages of the [[Pacific War]] of the Second World War, troops of the [[Japanese Imperial Forces]] invaded and overran Mindanao, and the native [[Moros during World War II|Moro Muslims waged an insurgency against the Japanese]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Three years later, in 1945, combined [[United States]] and [[Philippine Commonwealth|Philippine Commonwealth Army]] troops [[Battle of Mindanao|liberated]] Mindanao, and with the help of local guerrilla units, ultimately defeated the Japanese forces occupying the region.

===Postwar era===
Under pressure to resolve agrarian unrest in various parts of the country and noting that Mindanao was rich in mineral resources and weather favorable to agriculture, later Philippine presidents continued the promotion of migration which the American colonial government began in 1903. Massive arrivals of non-Muslim migrants happened particularly during the Commonwealth period under President [[Manuel Quezon]] and later under [[right-wing]] presidents [[Ramon Magsaysay]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref name="ConflictinMoroLand">{{Cite book|title = Conflict in Moro Land: Prospects for Peace?|last = Werning|first = Rainer|publisher = Universiti Sains Malaysia|year = 2009|pages = 6–8|chapter = Southern Philippines: Bitter Legacies of a Long-Lasting War|editor-last = Graf|editor-first = Arndt|editor-last2 = Kreuzer|editor-first2 = Peter|editor-last3 = Werning|editor-first3 = Rainer}}</ref> As a result, the proportion of indigenous peoples in Mindanao to shrink from majority in 1913 to minority by 1976.<ref name="ConflictinMoroLand"/> The best lands in Mindanao were given to settlers and owners of corporate agriculture, while most development investments and government services were offered to the Christian population.

The Muslims felt alienated by the Philippine government and felt threatened by the migrants' economic and political domination in their own homeland, the same way the Lumads were displaced centuries ago when Islam arrived in the Philippines. Some Muslim groups turned to extortion and violence to protect their land and avoid being displaced. These activities prevented the Muslims from easily integrating with the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite book |title=Filipino Politics: Development and Decay |last=Wurfel |first=David |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1988 |page=31 |editor-last=Kahin |editor-first=George McT.}}</ref>

The Philippine government did not immediately recognize Islamic laws which resulted in the system of education and the socioeconomic development of the Muslims. Children studying in public schools were forced to learn about Christianity while the Bangsamoros struggled with their economy, land, and ownership, and the persistence of hostile and unjust actions compared to the Christian communities in Mindanao.<ref name="auto"/>

As an effect of the resettlement, traditional Muslim leaders (also referred as ''datu'') were also voted out during the polls as Christians, who made up a significant majority of the voters, preferred the Christian politicians over them.

{{Main|Moro conflict}}

In March 1968, fishermen in [[Manila Bay]] rescued a Muslim man named Jibin Arula from the waters.

According to Jibin Arula's account, the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] administration had gathered a group of [[Tausūg people|Tausūg]] recruits for an operation called "Project Merdeka" (''[[merdeka]]'' being the Malay "freedom").

On September 23, 1972, Ferdinand Marcos announced that he had placed the entirety of the Philippines, including Muslim Mindanao, under [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|martial law]]. During this tumultuous period, relationships and alliances played a critical role in shaping the events. Tun Mustapha, then Chief Minister of Sabah, shared a common lineage with Sayyid Capt. Kalingalan “Apuh Inggal” Caluang, both tracing their ancestry back to the Sultans of Sulu. This shared heritage fostered a close bond between the two leaders, promoting goodwill and cooperation between their respective territories. With Tun Mustapha's support, the first cadre of MNLF fighters, including figures like Al Hussein Caluang, received training in Sabah after their time in Luuk, Sulu (now known as Kalingalan Caluang). While Datu Udtog Matalam's MIM was already defunct, one of its former members, [[Nur Misuari]], established the MNLF a month after the declaration of Martial Law, on October 21, 1972.<ref name="BetweenIntegrationandSecession"/>

''[[Proclamation 1081]]'' dissolved the various political groups that had been previously established in the Moro provinces, and with the MIM having already been dissolved, Marcos' declaration of martial law effectively assured the MNLF, which was more [[Political radicalism|radical]] than its predecessors, would come to dominate the Moro [[separatist]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/379 |title=Moro National Liberation Front |website=Stanford University Mapping Militants Project |access-date=March 8, 2019}}</ref>

=== Peace process ===
{{Main|Bangsamoro peace process}}

On December 23, 1976, the [[1976 Tripoli Agreement|Tripoli Agreement]] was signed between the Philippine government and the [[Moro National Liberation Front|MNLF]] with the deal brokered by then-Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Under a deal an autonomous region was to be created in Mindanao.<ref name="willitlast">{{cite news |last1=Unson |first1=John |title=Plebiscite in Mindanao: Will it be the last? |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/01/27/1888489/plebiscite-mindanao-will-it-be-last |access-date=January 27, 2019 |work=The Philippine Star |date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>

Marcos would later implement the agreement by creating two regional autonomous governments, rather than one, in Regions 9 and 12,<ref name="willitlast"/> which cover ten (instead of thirteen) provinces. This led to the collapse of the peace pact and the resumption of hostilities between the MNLF and [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government forces]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kin Wah |first=Chin |title=Southeast Asian Affairs 2004 |publisher=[[Institute of Southeast Asian Studies]] |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mKsed7mQzQC&q=1976+Tripoli+Agreement&pg=PA219 |isbn=978-981-230-238-0}}</ref><ref name="howe">{{cite book |last=Howe |first=Brendan M. |title=Post-Conflict Development in East Asia |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9ncAgAAQBAJ&q=1976+Tripoli+Agreement&pg=PA147 |isbn=978-1-4094-6943-8}}</ref>

In signing the 1976 Tripoli Agreement, however, Misuari did not consult one of the MNLF's key commanders, [[Salamat Hashim]]. Salamat formed a [[Political faction|splinter faction]] along with 57 other MNLF ground commanders, which then became the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF).<ref name="Stripped">{{Cite news |url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/120350/stripped-naked-by-history |title=Stripped naked by history |last=Mayuga |first=Sylvia L. |date=March 26, 2019 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |access-date=March 26, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

A year after Marcos was ousted from power during the [[People Power Revolution]], the government under President [[Corazon Aquino]] signed the 1987 [[Jeddah Accord]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] with the MNLF, agreeing to hold further discussions on the proposal for autonomy to the entirety of Mindanao and not just the thirteen provinces stated in the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. In 1989, however, an act establishing the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) was passed. The MNLF demanded that the thirteen Tripoli Agreement provinces, majority of which were Christian provinces, be included in the ARMM, but the government refused; eight of those provinces were predominantly [[Christians|Christian]]. Shortly thereafter, the government held only four provinces as only [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Maguindanao]], [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-tawi]] voted to be included in the ARMM. The four provinces were the only Muslim-majority provinces at the time.<ref name="howe"/>

==== Formation of ARMM and 1996 peace deal ====
{{main|Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|1996 Final Peace Agreement}}

A [[1989 Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao creation plebiscite|plebiscite]] was held in 1989 for the ratification of the charter which created the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), with Zacaria Candao, a counsel of the MNLF as the first elected regional governor. On September 2, 1996, a final [[1996 Final Peace Agreement|peace deal]] was signed between the MNLF and the Philippine government under President [[Fidel Ramos]]. MNLF leader and founder [[Nur Misuari]] was elected regional governor three days after the agreement.<ref name="willitlast" /> Another [[2001 Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao expansion and inclusion plebiscite|plebiscite]] was held in 2001 for the expansion of the region, with the city of [[Marawi]] and the province of [[Basilan]] (excluding [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]]) joining the region.

It also resulted in the rejection from the province of Lanao del Norte against the bid of six of its Muslim-majority towns to join the Bangsamoro, despite the six towns ([[Baloi, Lanao del Norte|Baloi]], [[Munai, Lanao del Norte|Munai]], [[Nunungan, Lanao del Norte|Nunungan]], [[Pantar, Lanao del Norte|Pantar]], [[Tagoloan, Lanao del Norte|Tagoloan]] and [[Tangcal, Lanao del Norte|Tangcal]]) opting to join the Bangsamoro by a sheer majority, with one town even voting for inclusion by 100%.

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Map of Bangsamoro (local government units).svg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|Administrative divisions of Bangsamoro]]

===Provinces===
Bangsamoro consists of five provinces, three ''component'' [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], 116 [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]], and 2,490 [[barangay]]s. The city of [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]], despite being part of [[Basilan]], is not under the administrative jurisdiction of the autonomous region. Likewise, 63 barangays in [[North Cotabato]] also are part of Bangsamoro as the [[Special Geographic Area]] (SGA), despite North Cotabato and their respective parent municipalities not being under the administrative jurisdiction of the autonomous region.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Arguilas |first1=Carolyn |title=Pikit's fate: 20 barangays remain with North Cotabato, 22 joining BARMM |url=https://www.mindanews.com/peace-process/2019/02/pikits-fate-20-barangays-remain-with-north-cotabato-22-joining-barmm/ |access-date=February 9, 2019 |work=Minda News |date=February 8, 2019}}</ref> The barangays were reconstituted into eight municipalities following a [[2024 Special Geographic Area plebiscites|plebiscite on April 13, 2024]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bolledo |first1=Jairo |title=BARMM residents approve creation of 8 more towns |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/barmm-residents-approve-creation-municipalities-plebiscite-april-2024/ |access-date=13 April 2024 |work=Rappler |date=13 April 2024}}</ref>

As per the organic law, the people "at the advent of the [[Spanish Colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]], were considered natives or original inhabitants of [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu archipelago]] and its adjacent islands, shall have the right to identify themselves, their spouses and descendants" as part of the Bangsamoro people.<ref name=crisis>{{cite news |last1=Bajo |first1=Anna Felicia |last2=Masino |first2=Dona |title=Paghubog: Mga Kuwentong Bangsamoro |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/specials/content/181/paghubog-mga-kuwentong-bangsamoro/ |access-date=2 July 2022 |work=GMA News |date=31 January 2021 |language=fil, en}}</ref>

The [[Moro people]] are an umbrella term for ethnic groups who are mainly Muslim. The [[Maranao people|Maranaos]] and [[Iranun people|Iranun]] form a large portion of the region's population.

===Languages===

The Moro and Lumad speak their native languages. Non-native languages spoken are [[ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[chabacano language|Chabacano]], [[hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[cebuano language|Cebuano]], and [[tagalog language|Tagalog]], of which the latter two serve as [[lingua franca]]s. This is the case for Cebuano because of the mass arrival of Cebuano settlers to Mindanao. Tausug are at ease in speaking Cebuano, because both Tausug and Cebuano are [[Visayan languages]]. Chabacano may be the lingua franca of the natives in Sulu Archipelago, along with Tagalog, but it is the main lingua franca in Basilan. Many locals and barter traders in Sulu Archipelago can also speak [[malay trade and creole languages#Sabah Malay|Sabah Malay]]. See also: [[Malay language in the Philippines]]

==Government==
{{main|Bangsamoro Transition Authority}}

Between the ratification of the BOL and the inauguration of its first permanent government in 2025, the BTA will head the region. After the ratification of the BOL, the [[Bangsamoro Transition Commission]] (BTC) begins to transition the ARMM into the BARMM.

===Organizational structure===
[[File:PR-Chief Minister Ebrahim 09-2022.jpg|thumb|Chief Minister [[Murad Ebrahim]]]]
Based on the organic law, the autonomous Bangsamoro government system is [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary-democratic]], similar to that practised in the [[United Kingdom]], a [[Westminster system]] which is based on a political party system.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Quintos |first1=Patrick |title=After Bangsamoro Organic Law is ratified, now comes the hard part |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/01/25/19/after-bangsamoro-organic-law-is-ratified-now-comes-the-hard-part |access-date=January 26, 2019 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=January 25, 2019 |quote=The autonomous Bangsamoro government will be parliamentary-democratic, similar to the United Kingdom, and based on a political party system.}}</ref>

====Ceremonial====
The [[Figurehead|ceremonial head]] of the region is the [[Wa'lī of Bangsamoro|''wa'lī'']]. The [[Bangsamoro Parliament]] selects and appoints the ''wa'lī''. The ''wa'lī'' has ceremonial functions and powers such as moral guardianship of the territory and [[convocation]] and dissolution of the [[legislature]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Calonzo |first1=Andreo |title=PNoy personally submits draft Bangsamoro law to Congress leaders |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/378481/pnoy-personally-submits-draft-bangsamoro-law-to-congress-leaders/story/ |access-date=February 2, 2015 |work=GMA News |date=September 10, 2014}}</ref>

====Executive====
The regional government is headed by a [[Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro|chief minister]]. Murad Ebrahim is the current chief minister, who was appointed by the former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, on an interim basis. The interim chief minister is also the head of the BTA, which also serves the function of serving as the transitional Bangsamoro Parliament.

Once the first regular session of the Bangsamoro Parliament is organized come 2025, the chief minister will be elected by the members of the Bangsamoro Parliament from the majority party or coalition holding the most seats won. The chief minister of the Bangsamoro is the chief executive of the regional government and is assisted by a cabinet having a minimum of 10 ministers and two deputy chief ministers. The holder of this position appoints the members of the cabinet, subject to confirmation by Parliament. The chief minister has control of all the regional executive commissions, agencies, boards, bureaus, and offices.

'''Cabinet'''<br />
The [[Bangsamoro Cabinet]] is composed of two [[Deputy Chief Ministers of Bangsamoro|deputy chief minister]]s and ministers, all appointed among members of the parliament. The deputy chief ministers are selected through nomination of the chief minister and are elected by the members of the Parliament. The ministers in the cabinet on their part are appointed by the chief minister.<ref name=keyofficial>{{cite news |last1=Gavilan |first1=Jodesz |title=Key positions in the Bangsamoro government |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fast-facts/222104-things-to-know-key-positions-bangsamoro-government |access-date=February 23, 2019 |work=Rappler |date=January 31, 2019}}</ref>

'''Council of Leaders'''<br />
The [[Council of Leaders of Bangsamoro|Council of Leaders]] advises the chief minister on matters of governance of the autonomous region. It is roughly an equivalent of an unelected [[Senate]], though only advisory, without [[legislative power]]s, and not part of the Parliament.<ref name=keyofficial/>

====Legislative====
[[File:BARMM lawmakers refile local governance code.jpg|thumb|The [[Bangsamoro Parliament]] in session.]]
Under the BOL, the [[Bangsamoro Parliament]] serves as the legislature of the autonomous region, mandated to have 80 deputies and is led by the [[Speaker of the Bangsamoro Parliament|speaker]]. The ''wa'lī'', a ceremonial head, could dissolve the parliament at his discretion.

Regional [[local ordinance|ordinance]]s are created by the Bangsamoro Parliament, composed of members of Parliament. Members are meant to be elected by direct vote. Regional elections are planned to be held one year after [[general election]]s (national and local) depending on legislation from Congress. The first Bangsamoro regional elections are to be held in 2025. Regional officials have a fixed term of three years, which can be extended by an act of Congress.

Under the BOL, the BTA was organized as a transitional body pending the election of the new region's government officials in 2025, with the first regular [[legislative session|session]] of the parliament to be held in 2025 following the elections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

====Judiciary====
{{See also|Shari'ah in the Philippines#Organization}}
The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region has its own regional justice system which applies [[Shari'ah]] to its residents like its predecessor, the ARMM. Unlike its predecessor though, the BOL, which became effective as of August 10, 2018,<ref>{{cite news|last=Lalu|first=Gabriel Pabico|date=October 30, 2018 |title=Sulu LGU asks SC to junk 'unconstitutional' Bangsamoro law|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1048310/sulu-lgu-asks-sc-to-junk-unconstitutional-bangsamoro-law|access-date=July 25, 2020 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}</ref> has a provision for the creation of a Shari'ah High Court, which, if and when realized, would consist of five justices including a presiding justice and would oversee [[appellate court]]s, [[district court]]s, and [[circuit court]]s. Non-Muslims could also volunteer to submit themselves under the jurisdiction of Shari'ah law. The Bangsamoro justice system also recognizes traditional or tribal laws but these would only apply to disputes of [[indigenous peoples]] within the region.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bicam approves creation of Shari'ah High Court in Bangsamoro |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/207171-bicameral-conference-committee-approval-shariah-high-court-bangsamoro |access-date=February 8, 2019 |work=Rappler |date=July 12, 2018}}</ref>

===Relation to the central government===
The Bangsamoro Organic Law provides that BARMM "shall remain an integral and inseparable part of the national territory of the Republic." The Philippine president exercises general supervision over the regional chief minister. The regional government has fiscal autonomy or the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees, and charges, subject to Constitutional provisions and the provisions of [[Bangsamoro Organic Law|Republic Act 11054]]. The regional government has to gain approval from the central government's [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Department of Finance]] to receive donations and grants from foreign entities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Laforga |first1=Beatrice |title=Bangsamoro rules for accepting foreign grants approved |url=https://www.bworldonline.com/bangsamoro-rules-for-accepting-foreign-grants-approved/ |access-date=March 9, 2021 |work=BusinessWorld |date=March 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Polloc Port.jpg|thumb|Port of Polloc in Parang, Maguindanao del Norte]]
{{PH poverty incidence}}
Before the various successes in the Bangsamoro peace processes, economic development in the region had been described as seeing "decades of sluggish economic growth,"<ref name="2024WBFarmProfitabilityPRelease"/> with much economic activity coming from the informal sector - effectively "shadow economies" which were identified as drivers of conflict.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 2014 |title=Understanding conflict.

The people of the Bangsamoro region, including Muslims, [[Lumad]]s, and Christians, have a culture that revolves around [[kulintang]] music, a specific type of gong music, found among both Muslim and non-Muslim groups of the Southern Philippines. Each ethnic group in BARMM also has their own distinct architectures, intangible heritage, and craft arts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kamlian |first1=Jamail A |title=Bangsamoro society and culture: a book of readings on peace and development in Southern Philippines |url=https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999908638502121 |access-date=January 26, 2019 |website=University of Wisconsin–Madison Library |type=Library catalogue record |year=1999|publisher=Iligan Center for Peace Education and Research, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Extension, MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Bangsamoro Development Plan Integrative Report |chapter=Culture and Identity |chapter-url=http://bangsamorodevelopment.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CHAPTER-11_BDP-Integrative-Report.pdf |access-date=May 31, 2016 |publisher=Bangsamoro Development Agency |year=2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808021723/http://bangsamorodevelopment.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CHAPTER-11_BDP-Integrative-Report.pdf |archive-date=August 8, 2017 }}</ref> A fine example of a distinct architectural style in the region is the Royal Sulu architecture which was used to make the [[Daru Jambangan]] (Palace of Flowers) in [[Maimbung, Sulu|Maimbung]], Sulu.

A campaign to faithfully re-establish it in Maimbung town has been ongoing since 1933. A very small replica of the palace was made in a nearby town in the 2010s, but it was noted that the replica does not mean that the campaign to reconstruct the palace in Maimbung has stopped as the replica does not manifest the true essence of a Sulu royal palace. In 2013, Maimbung was designated as the royal capital of the former [[Sultanate of Sulu]] by one of the family claimants to the Sulu Sultanate throne where the pretenders are buried there.{{clarify|date=May 2019}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Whaley |first1=Floyd |title=Obituary: Jamalul Kiram III / Self-proclaimed 'poorest sultan' |url=https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2013/10/21/Obituary-Jamalul-Kiram-III-Self-proclaimed-poorest-sultan/stories/201310210083 |access-date=February 2, 2015 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=October 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Whaley |first1=Floyd |title=Esmail Kiram II, Self-Proclaimed Sultan of Sulu, Dies at 75 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/world/asia/esmail-kiram-ii-self-proclaimed-sultan-of-sulu-dies-at-75.html |access-date=February 2, 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=September 21, 2015}}</ref>
