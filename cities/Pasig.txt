'''Pasig''', officially the '''City of Pasig''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Pasig}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 803,159 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is located along the eastern border of [[Metro Manila]] with [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] province, the city shares its name with the [[Pasig River]]. A formerly [[rural settlement]], Pasig is primarily residential and industrial, but has been becoming increasingly [[commercial district|commercial]] in recent years, particularly after the construction of the [[Ortigas Center]] business district in its west. The city is home to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig]], based in [[Pasig Cathedral]], a landmark built around the same time as the town's foundation in 1573.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Pasig City 1.jpg|thumb|left|Old center of Pasig near the [[Pasig Cathedral]]]]
The city's name, ''Pasig'', is a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word which means, "a river that flows into the sea" or "sandy bank of a river".<ref>{{cite web

 |publisher=Robert Blust and Stephen Trussel}}</ref>

Etymologically, it is a word of [[Proto-Malayic]] (PM), ''*pasir'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/160609148.pdf  |title=Proto Malayic: The Reconstruction of Its Phonology and Parts of Its Lexicon and Morphology

==History==

===Early history===
There are no surviving firsthand accounts of the history of Pasig before Spanish colonizers arrived in 1573 and established the settlement, which they called the Ciudad-Municipal de Pasig.<ref name="Scott1984">{{Cite book|title=Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|author-link=William Henry Scott (historian)|publisher=New Day Publishers|date=1984|location=[[Quezon City]]|isbn=978-9711002268|chapter=Societies in Prehispanic Philippines}}</ref>

[[File:Pasig City (41).jpg|thumb|left|A section of the Bitukang Manok]]
However, surviving genealogical records and folk histories speak of a thriving [[precolonial barangay]] on the banks of the Bitukang Manok River (now nearly extinct and known as Parian Creek), which eventually became modern-day Pasig. The most significant rulers of this precolonial polity were [[Rajah Lontok]] and [[Dayang Kalangitan]] according to legends, which also say that they are closely related to the precolonial rulers of the [[Tondo (historical polity)|Kingdom of Tondo]] and the [[Rajahnate of Maynila]].<ref name="Dery2001">{{cite book|last=Dery|first=Luis Camara|title=A History of the Inarticulate|publisher=New Day Publishers|date=2001|location=[[Quezon City]]|isbn=971-10-1069-0}}</ref>

The creek was given the name ''Bitukang Manok'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "Chicken [[Gut (anatomy)|Gut]]") due to the serpentine shape of its waterway.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} Among its early dwellers were Tagalogs,\ [[Chinese Filipinos|people from South China]] with origins dating back to the [[Ming dynasty]]), and the [[Itneg people]], nomads who migrated from the deep jungles of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre Mountain Range]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} The Bitukang Manok was once a principal tributary of the [[Marikina River]]. The Spanish colonizers called the creek ''Rio de Pasig''; however, the natives still called it the Bitukang Manok.

The first stretch of the Bitukang Manok became known as the "Pariancillo" (Estero de San Agustin), where its shoreline was once settled by ethnic Chinese and [[Malay people|Malay]] merchants to trade their goods with Tagalogs until it developed up to the 1970s as the city's main public market. Likewise, the creek contributed enormously to the economic growth of Pasig during the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish colonial era (1565–1898)]] through [[irrigation]] of its wide [[paddy field]]s, and by being the progressive center of barter trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The Bitukang Manok, also known as the "Parian Creek," had once linked the Marikina River with the [[Antipolo]]. Before the [[Manggahan Floodway]] was built in 1986, The Parian Creek was connected to the Sapang Bato-Buli Creek (which serves as the boundary between Pasig's barangays Dela Paz-Manggahan-Rosario-Santa Lucia and the Municipality of [[Cainta]]), the Kasibulan Creek (situated at Vista Verde, Barangay San Isidro, Cainta), the Palanas Creek (leaving Antipolo through Barangay Muntindilao), the Bulaw Creek (on Barangay Mambungan, besides the Valley Golf and Country Club), and the [[Hinulugang Taktak]] falls of Barangay Dela Paz (fed by the Taktak Creek passing close to the Antipolo Town Square), thus being the detached and long-abandoned Antipolo River.

===Spanish colonial era===
[[File:Pasig City (98).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bahay na Tisa (Pasig)|Bahay na Tisa]]'' (Tech House), the oldest existing [[bahay na bato]] in Pasig, was built in the 1850s.]]

Since the early 1600s up to the period of [[Japanese Imperialism]], over a thousand Catholic devotees coming from "Maynilad" (Manila), "Hacienda Pineda" ([[Pasay]]), "[[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] del Monte", "[[Hacienda]] de Mandaloyon" ([[Mandaluyong]]), "Hacienda Mariquina" ([[Marikina]]), "Barrio [[Pateros]]", "Pueblo de Tagig" ([[Taguig]]), and "San Pedro de Macati" ([[Makati]]), followed the trail of the Parian Creek to the Pilgrimage Cathedral on the mountainous pueblo of Antipolo, [[Morong (district)|Morong]] (the present-day [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] province).

The Antipoleños and several locals from the far-reached barrios of "Poblacion de San Mateo", "Montalban" ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]), "Monte de Tanhai" ([[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]), "Santa Rosa-Oroquieta" ([[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]]), and "Punta Ibayo" ([[Baras, Rizal|Baras]]), had also navigated this freshwater creek once to go down to the vast "Kapatagan" (Rice plains) of lowland Pasig. Even the [[marian devotions|marian]] processions of the [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] passed this route back and forth eleven times.

In the 1600s, Fr. Joaqin Martinez de Zuñiga, conducted a census of Pasig City based on tributes and each tribute representing an average family of 5 to 7, and found that it totalled 3000 tributes, half of which were Indios (Native Filipinos) and the other half were Sangleys (Chinese Filipinos)<ref name="Estadismo1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.xeniaeditrice.it/zu%C3%B1igaIocrpdf.pdf |title=ESTADISMO DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS TOMO PRIMERO By Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga (Original Spanish) |access-date=February 3, 2024 |archive-date=March 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309030040/http://www.xeniaeditrice.it/zu%C3%B1igaIocrpdf.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|296}} These tributes were policed by a company of Mexican soldiers under command by a handful of Spanish, patrolling the Pasig river from nearby Fort Santiago which has the Pasig river snake through it. The years: 1636, 1654, 1670, and 1672; saw the deployment of 22, 50, 86, and 81 of these Latin-American soldiers from [[Mexican settlement in the Philippines|Mexico at Fort Santiago]] patrolling along the Pasig.<ref name= "Mexicans" >[https://academic.oup.com/past/article/232/1/87/1752419 Convicts or Conquistadores?

Indian Filipinos (from [[India]]) that had later settled in nearby [[Cainta, Rizal]] also visit Pasig on their way to the capital.

The creek has been also used during the [[British Occupation of Manila]] in 1762 to 1764 by the Royal [[British army]], under the leadership of General [[William Draper (British Army officer)|William Draper]] and Vice Admiral [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet]], to transport their red troops (and also the [[Sepoys]] they've brought from [[East India]]) upstream to take over the nearby forest-surrounded villages of Cainta and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]]. They even did an ambush at the "Plaza Central" in front of the [[Pasig Cathedral]], and turned the [[Roman Catholic]] Parish into their military headquarters, with the church's fortress-like "Campanilla" ([[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]) serving as a watchtower against Spanish defenders sailing from the walled city of [[Intramuros]] via the [[Pasig River]].

The Sepoys backstabbed their abusive British lieutenants and sided with the combined forces of the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] (assigned by the [[Governor-General]] [[Simon de Anda y Salazar]]), local rice farmers, fisherfolk, and even Chinese traders. After the British Invasion, the Sepoys remained and intermarried with [[Filipina]] women, and that explains the [[Hindu]] features of some of today's citizens of Pasig, especially Cainta and Taytay.

In 1742, an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] friar named Fray Domingo Diaz, together with a group of wealthy "Mestizos de [[Sangley]]" (Chinese Mestizos) from Sagad, ordered a construction of a marble, roof-tiled cover bridge across the creek in the style of an oriental pagoda. It was named "Puente del Pariancillo", and a few years later, it changed to "Puente de Fray Felix Trillo", dedicated to the dynamic parochial curate of the Immaculate Conception Parish. [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited Pasig in 1832.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|author-link=Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)#Harper & Brothers (1833–1962)|Harper & Brothers]]|location=New York|page=60|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/60/}}</ref>

On the night of May 2, 1896, more than 300 revolutionary [[Katipunan|Katipuneros]], led by the Supremo Gat. [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Jacinto]] and [[Pio Valenzuela]], secretly gained access in this very creek aboard a fleet of seventeen "Bangkas" (canoes) to the old residence of a notable Valentin Cruz at Barangay San Nicolas, and formed the "Asamblea Magna" (mass meeting).

Three months later on Saturday evening, August 29, about less than 2,000 working-class Pasigueños (along with a hundred Chinese "[[Trabajadores]]" (laborers) from the failed Sangley revolts of 1639 and throughout the 17th century), armed with coconuts, machetes and bayoneted muskets (some were donated by the rich [[Ilustrado]] families, while many of those guns were looted from Spanish authorities), joined the [[Katipunan]] and made a surprise attack at the "Municipio del [[Gobernadorcillo]]" (the current site of the Pasig City Hall) and its adjacent garrison of the "Guardias Civil" ([[Civil Guard (Philippines)|Civil Guard]]), situated near the border of barangays Maybunga and Caniogan.

That was the first and victorious rebellion ever accomplished by the Katipunan, and that particular event was popularly known as the "Nagsabado sa Pasig" (the Saturday Uprising on Pasig). After they had managed to successfully out-thrown the seat of Spanish [[government]] on Pasig, the Katipuneros fled immediately and advanced towards a "[[Sitio]]" located at the neighboring "Ciudad de San Juan" called "Pinaglabanan", and there they launched their second attempt to end the numerous cases of corruption made by the greedy Castilian "[[Encomenderos]]" (town officials) and "Hacienderos" (landlords), which shall be commemorated as the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]].

On June 11, 1901, during the [[Philippine–American War]], the province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] was created through Act No. 137 of the [[Philippine Commission]].<ref>{{Cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l2485 |date=June 11, 1901 |title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Rizal |chamber=Act |number=137}}</ref> Pasig was incorporated into the province of Rizal, and was designated as the capital of the new province.

In 1939, the barrio or sitio of Ogong (Ugong Norte), which includes the present-day Libis area, was separated from Pasig to form part of the newly established [[Quezon City]].<ref name="CorruptioninQC">{{cite web |title=Quezon's City: Corruption and contradiction in Manila's prewar suburbia, 1935–1941 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/22505B43861B5BB45FE261C348A1FDDF/S0022463416000497a.pdf/div-class-title-quezon-s-city-corruption-and-contradiction-in-manila-s-prewar-suburbia-1935-1941-div.pdf |last1=Pante |first1=Michael D. |website=Cambridge.org |date=February 2017 |access-date=May 29, 2022 }}</ref>

After [[World War II]], the Bitukang Manok was slowly exposing its ecological downfall. It resulted in water pollution due to rational ignorance. The worst came to the Bitukang Manok in the late 1960s when the disappearing waterway, instead of being revived was totally separated from the Marikina River, and was converted into an open sewage ditch, with its original flow now moving in reverse towards the direction of the Napindan Channel (a portion of the Pasig River bordering between the barangays Kalawaan-Pinagbuhatan and Taguig), to give way to public commercial facilities.

====The Martial Law era ====
{{See also|Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos}}
Pasig was home to a number of prominent human rights advocates who became prominent during the administration of Ferdinand Marcos. One of these advocates was lawyer and publisher Augusto "Bobbit" Sanchez, whose publication "The Weekly Post" was so hardhitting that Pasig politicians came to refer to it as the "Weekly Pest."<ref name="BantayogProfileSanchez">{{Cite web |date=August 5, 2016 |title=SANCHEZ, Augusto S. |url=http://www.bantayog.org/sanchez-augusto-s/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018082733/http://www.bantayog.org/sanchez-augusto-s |archive-date=October 18, 2017 |access-date=January 3, 2021 |website=Bantayog ng mga Bayani |language=en-US}}</ref>  Another human rights advocate who was an early critic of Marcos' policies was opposition figure [[Jovito Salonga]], a Pasig native who was elected representative of Rizal in 1961.<ref name="KaterinaFranciscoSalongaPasigBurial">{{Cite news |last=Francisco |first=Katerina |date=March 16, 2016 |title='Son of Pasig' Jovito Salonga laid to rest in his hometown |language=en |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/jovito-salonga-pasig-burial |url-status=live |access-date=January 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200815205822/https://www.rappler.com/nation/jovito-salonga-pasig-burial |archive-date=August 15, 2020}}</ref>

When Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus in 1971, eventually declared [[Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos|Martial Law]] in September 1972, students were unable to congregate. In Pasig, one of the prominent residences that sheltered them and allowed them to meet together was the Bahay na Tisa in Barangay San Jose. Because the house was also the venue of meetings of prominent Pasig leaders who were pro-Marcos, it came to be known as Pasig's "Freedom House."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Servallos |first=Neil Jayson |title=Pasig's martial law 'freedom house' named important cultural property |work=The [[Philippine Star]] |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/02/25/1995818/pasigs-martial-law-freedom-house-named-important-cultural-property |url-status=live |access-date=January 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225132605/https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/02/25/1995818/pasigs-martial-law-freedom-house-named-important-cultural-property |archive-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>  The house has since been declared an Important Cultural Property by the Philippines' National Museum.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 26, 2020 |title=Pasig City |url=https://www.pasigcity.gov.ph/historical-spots |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426113437/https://www.pasigcity.gov.ph/historical-spots |archive-date=April 26, 2020 |access-date=January 3, 2021 |website=www.pasigcity.gov.ph}}</ref>

Another prominent site in Pasig which was affected by Martial Law was the [[Benpres Building]], which was shuttered by the [[Philippine Constabulary]] when Marcos' declaration closed down all media outlets on September 23, 1972.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lopez-museum.com/2016/03/15/newsroom-shutdown/ |title=Newsroom Shutdown |last=lopezmuseumweb |date=March 15, 2016 |website=Lopez Museum & Library |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401125423/https://lopez-museum.com/2016/03/15/newsroom-shutdown/ |archive-date=April 1, 2016 |access-date=August 11, 2017}}</ref>

After the fall of the dictatorship, one of the first properties to be surrendered by a Marcos crony to the PCGG was the "Payanig sa Pasig" property, at the confluence of Ortigas, Meralco and [[Doña Julia Vargas Avenue]]s, whose title businessman [[Jose Yao Campos]] said he was keeping under the name of the Mid-Pasig Land Development Corp (MPLDC) in lieu of Ferdinand Marcos.  This was eventually sequestered by the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] as part of the [[Unexplained wealth of the Marcos family]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yee |first=Jovic |date=March 26, 2015 |title=PCGG to sell P16.5B 'Payanig sa Pasig' land soon |language=en |newspaper=The [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/681684/pcgg-to-sell-p16-5b-payanig-sa-pasig-land-soon |access-date=August 20, 2021}}</ref>

====Integration into Metro Manila====
{{See also|Metro Manila}}
On November 7, 1975, Pasig was carved out of Rizal province and became part of [[Metro Manila]] when the Metro Manila Commission (precursor of Metro Manila Authority and later [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]]) was created through Presidential Decree 824.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
In July 1994, Pasig was converted into a highly urbanized city through Republic Act 7829. And in December 1994, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed it into law, which was ratified through a plebiscite on January 21, 1995.

===Contemporary===
On February 4, 2006, the [[ULTRA Stampede]], in which 71 people died, happened during the first anniversary celebration of [[ABS-CBN]]'s noontime show ''[[Wowowee]]'', because of the prizes that were to be given away. The anniversary of the show would be held on [[PhilSports Arena]] but the event has been already cancelled due to the tragedy.

Pasig was one of the areas struck by the high flood created by [[Typhoon Ketsana|Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana)]] on September 26, 2009, which affected the Ortigas Avenue and the east city side of the Manggahan Floodway. It is the most destructive flood in Philippine history. Pasig is accessed by the [[Pasig River]], wherein the waters of [[Marikina River]] channeled and the Manggahan Floodway routed to [[Laguna de Bay]].

In the first week of August 2012, intense monsoon rain caused the [[2012 Philippines flooding]], which affected again Pasig and particularly the [[National Capital Region]] (NCR), [[Calabarzon]] and the southwest part of [[Luzon]]. The nonstop eight-day monsoon rain, strengthened by [[Typhoon Saola (2012)|Typhoon Gener]], caused the Marikina River to overflow and destroyed the same places that were ruined by Typhoon Ondoy in 2009.

On June 19, 2020, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed into law Republic Act No. 11475, officially transferring the capital of the Rizal province from Pasig to [[Antipolo]].<ref name="ra11475">{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=11475|title=An Act Transferring the Capital and Seat of Government of the Province of Rizal from the City of Pasig, Metro Manila to the City of Antipolo, Province of Rizal|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2020/06/19/republic-act-no-11475/|date=June 22, 2020|accessdate=May 29, 2022}}</ref> The law took effect on July 7, 2020, almost 45 years since Pasig became part of Metro Manila and around 11 years since the Rizal provincial government moved to the latter city.
[[File:Plaza Rizal Pasig Panorama.jpg|center|thumb|700x700px|Plaza Rizal in the [[poblacion]] area. On the center is Concepción Mansion, while on the far right is [[Pasig Cathedral]].]]

==Geography==
Pasig is bordered on the west by [[Quezon City]] and [[Mandaluyong]]; to the north by [[Marikina]]; to the south by [[Pateros]] and [[Taguig]]; and to the east by the municipalities of [[Cainta]] and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] in the province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]]. Pasig was also bounded by [[Makati]] to the southwest until 2023 when the Barangays Cembo, West Rembo, and East Rembo became part of Taguig.

The Pasig River runs through it and forms its southwestern and southeastern borders with Taguig, while the [[Marikina River]] forms its western border with Quezon City. The artificial [[Manggahan Floodway]], built in 1986, begins at its confluence with the Marikina River in its northeast.

===Barangays===
[[File:Ph fil pasig barangays.png|Political map of Pasig|thumb]]

Pasig is politically subdivided into 30 [[barangay]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/municipality.asp?muncode=137403000&regcode=13&provcode=74 |title=NSCB Philippine Standard Geographic Codes – City of Pasig |access-date=September 23, 2009 |archive-date=March 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322005513/http://nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/municipality.asp?muncode=137403000&regcode=13&provcode=74 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Its barangays are grouped into two districts for city council representation purposes.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7166_1991.html|title=An Act Providing for Synchronized National and Local Elections and for Electoral Reforms, Authorizing Appropriations Therefor, and for Other Purposes|date= November 26, 1991|chamber=RA|number=7166|accessdate=March 13, 2023}}</ref> The first district encompasses the southern and western sections of the city, while the second district encompasses the northern and eastern sections. Among these barangays, 27 are located on the northern side or right bank of the Pasig River while 3 (Buting, San Joaquin and Kalawaan) are located on the river's southern side or left bank.

===Climate===
The [[dry season]] runs through the months of November to April, while the [[wet season]] starts in May and lasts to November. The wet season reaches its peak in the month of August. Maximum [[rainfall]] in usually occurs from the month of June to September. The average annual of rainfall is {{convert|2,014.8|mm|in|sp=us}} with a peak of {{convert|420.0|mm|in|sp=us}} in July and a low {{convert|26.9|mm|in|sp=us}} in April. The highest [[temperature]] occurs during the month of April and May ({{convert|34|C|F}}) while the lowest occurs during the months of January & February ({{convert|24|C|F}}).

The Philippines, due to its geographical location, is one of the Asian countries often affected by [[typhoons]]. It is located within the so-called "typhoon belt". Generally, typhoon season starts from June and ends in November. However, the rest of the months are not entirely free of the typhoons since they are unpredictable in nature and might enter the country anytime of the year.

[[File:Mm-pasigortigas-aerial2012.jpg|thumb|Ortigas Center]]
[[File:Arco de Emperador Front.jpg|thumb|Arco de Emperador at [[Arcovia City]]]]
The western part of the city is where most of Pasig's financial resources are primarily concentrated. It includes numerous factories, warehouses, establishments and commercial facilities. They are primarily situated in [[Ortigas Center]], Pasig proper and along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue ([[Circumferential Road 5|C-5]]) and [[Ortigas Avenue]] ([[Radial Road 5|R-5 Road]]). Real estate and commercial developments along Mercedes Avenue and other areas near the city center are developing. The eastern part was mostly dominated by residential areas but numerous commercial establishments are now being developed along [[Marikina–Infanta Highway|Marcos Highway]]. In the arguably more significant western part of Pasig, east of the city of [[Mandaluyong]] and part of the barangay of San Antonio, lies the [[Ortigas Center]].

[[Ortigas Center]] is one of the top business districts in the country. Numerous high-rise office buildings, residential condominiums, commercial establishments, schools and malls are situated here. The [[University of Asia and the Pacific]] is also located here. The head office of the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] was established in the district. The former headquarters of the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] is located along [[ADB Avenue]]. [[San Miguel Corporation]], owner of one of the largest producers of beer in Asia, also has its headquarters in the district along San Miguel Avenue. Situated along Ortigas Avenue is [[Crowne Plaza]], a five-star hotel near [[Robinsons Galleria]]. Adjacent to Ortigas Center is [[Capitol Commons]], a mixed-use development that was built on the old site of the second Rizal Provincial Capitol.

Notable developments along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue ([[Circumferential Road 5|C-5]]) include [[Arcovia City]], The Grove by Rockwell, and Ortigas East (formerly Frontera Verde), home of the [[Tiendesitas]] market. El-Pueblo, a colonial-themed commercial complex in Ortigas Center, provides new concept of cafes, restaurants and bars.

===Railway===
This city is also served by [[Santolan station (LRT)|Santolan]] and [[Marikina–Pasig station|Marikina–Pasig]] Stations of [[LRT Line 2 (Metro Manila)|LRT Line 2]], albeit being located within the city of Marikina, located along Marcos Highway near the Pasig–Marikina boundary. The line's depot is located in Barangay Santolan, Pasig. The city will also be served by the [[Metro Manila Subway]], which is currently under construction, and [[MRT Line 4 (Metro Manila)|MRT Line 4]], which has been approved. The Metro Manila Subway will have two stations in [[Ortigas Center]], namely: Ortigas North and Ortigas South.

Long before the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System]] finally opened its services in the early 2000s, steam train services had once served Pasig in the past, even before World War II.

In [[Marikina]], there is a street named "Daangbakal", also called by the names of "Shoe Avenue Extension", "Munding Avenue" and "Bagong Silang". There is also a similar "Daangbakal" in the [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and Montalban ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]) areas, and on the maps one can notice that the two roads should have been connected with each other. In fact, as the name suggests in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], these streets were once a single railway line. The two sides of the "Daangbakal" roads were once connected by a bridge in the San Mateo-Marikina border. However, as the railroad tracks have been largely ignored after the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]] and was transformed into separate roads, the railway connection was abandoned.

The old railroad tracks, called the Montalban Branch, was connected from [[Tutuban station]] in [[Manila]], passing through Tramo (Barangay Rosario, Pasig) coming all the way to the town of [[Marikina]] up to [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]]. On the northern end of the "Daangbakal" road in Montablan is a basketball court. That basketball court which stands today, surrounded by the Montalban Catholic Church and Cemetery, was once the railway station terminus of that particular line.

The present-day Santo Niño Elementary School in Marikina was said to be a train depot. And also it was said that a railroad station once stood in the Marikina City Sports Park.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

The Montalban Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=CA|number=59|url=https://thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/commonwealth-acts/ca-no-59.php|title=An Act Authorizing the Manila Railroad Company of the Philippine Islands to Discontinue and Abandon its Railroad Lines Between: (A) the Municipalities Ot Pasig (Rosario) and Montalban, Province of Rizal; (B) the Railroad Station at Paco, Manila and the Municipality of Naic, Province of Cavite; (C) the Municipalities of Batangas and Bauan, Province of Batangas; and (D) the Municipalities of Legaspi and Tabaco, Province of Albay|date=October 20, 1936|accessdate=March 13, 2023}}</ref> It was said that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.

Today, the citizens are dependent on [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|tricycles]], [[jeepneys]], taxis, [[UV Express]], buses, and AUV's which contribute to the everyday unusual and unbearable traffic of Metro Manila. Even now, there is uncertainty in the Northrail project, which links Manila to the northern provinces of [[Luzon]], because of corruption within the project's construction.

Aside from the Montalban Line, another railway branch in the Antipolo Line had existed in the city before it was permanently removed. It traversed from [[Santa Mesa]] to [[Antipolo]]. There is also a street named "Daangbakal" in Antipolo, where like the "Daangbakal" roads on Marikina and San Mateo, a railway line once existed. Its operation ceased in 1917.
