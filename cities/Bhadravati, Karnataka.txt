== History ==
Bhadravati derives its name from the [[Bhadra River]] which flows through the city. It was earlier known as Benkipura, which in English means "city of fire",<ref name=tourism /> and earlier ''Benki Pattana'. At some point in history, it was probably also known as Venkipura ('venki' means 'turn' in Sanksrit),<ref name="auto">{{cite book |last1=ನಾಯಕ, ಹಾ. ಮ. |title=ಕನ್ನಡ ಭಾರತಿ 6: ಆರನೆಯ ತರಗತಿ |date=n.d. |publisher=Karnataka Sarkara Text Book Department |page=89 |url=https://archive.org/details/wxxQ_kannada-bharati-6-kannada-karnataka-sarkara-text-book-department/page/n97/mode/2up |access-date=29 April 2022}}</ref> as it is situated at the place where Bhadra river takes a 90 degree turn to the west, and then to the east. Hoysalas ruled the city. The Goddess "Haladammadevi & Antaragattammadevi" have guarded the city since past time. The sacred temples are still present in the city.<ref name=tourism />''

In 1413, Yerelakka nayaka (ಎರೆಲಕ್ಕನಾಯಕ) who was ruling the two cities called Dumma and Banuru (ದುಮ್ಮ, ಬಾಣೂರು), built two more cities, after clearing some of the wild forest, and named them, Narasimha Pura and Lakshmipura. Subsequently, these two cities became Benkipura or Venkipura and then Bhadravathi, as it is situated on the banks of Bhadra river.<ref name="auto"/> 

Iron ore from the [[hill station]] of [[Kemmannugundi]] and water from the Bhadra River helped the establishment of an iron mill in 1918 Known as Mysore Iron and Steel Limited (MISL).
