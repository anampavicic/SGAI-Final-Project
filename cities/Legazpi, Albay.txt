==Etymology==
[[File:Miguel López de Legazpi, en La Hormiga de Oro.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Miguel López de Legazpi]]]]
The city of Legazpi was named after [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], the Basque Spanish ''[[conquistador]]'' who officially annexed the [[Philippine Islands]] to the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1565, and whose surname came from [[Legazpi, Spain|a town]] in [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Spain]].

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic===
The area that is now Albay had a thriving civilization before the Spanish arrived.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Tourism – The Philippines Ultimate Travel Guide for Tourist|url=http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=Albay&Page=1&pid=449|website=www.visitmyphilippines.com|access-date=October 18, 2015|archive-date=March 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327061525/http://visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=Albay&Page=1&pid=449|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Spanish explorers found densely populated settlements with an abundance of gold and provisions in the southern [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] peninsula.<ref name="Newson">{{Cite book|title=Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF_UgEGu0dEC|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai'i Press]]|date=January 1, 2009|isbn=9780824832728|first=Linda A.|last=Newson|author-link=Linda Newson}}</ref> Ancient inhabitants practiced rice cultivation, made fine gold jewelry and possessed silk, suggesting trade with China.<ref name="Newson"/> American anthropologist [[H.

===Foundation===
Legazpi was originally a fishing settlement called '''Sawangan''' that occupied the mangrove swamps that is now the Legazpi Port, inhabited by fisher folk and farmers.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Legazpi City and other Albay towns – Camperspoint Philippines|url = http://www.camperspoint.com/History-of-Legazpi-City-and-other|website = www.camperspoint.com|access-date=October 18, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151125104134/http://www.camperspoint.com/History-of-Legazpi-City-and-other|archive-date = November 25, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> In 1569, a Spanish expedition dispatched by [[Miguel López de Legazpi|Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]] led by Luis Enriquez de Guzman and Augustinian friar Alonso Jimenez first set foot in Albay. They arrived on the coastal settlement called [[Ibalon]] in present-day [[Magallanes, Sorsogon]] after exploring the islands of [[Masbate Island|Masbate]], [[Ticao Island|Ticao]] and [[Burias (island)|Burias]] and proceeded inland as far as present-day [[Camalig, Albay]].<ref name="Newson"/><ref>{{cite web|title = History|url = http://albay.gov.ph/about/albayhistory/|website = Province of Albay|access-date = October 18, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151125173326/http://albay.gov.ph/about/albayhistory/|archive-date = November 25, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

In July 1573, the conquistador [[Juan de Salcedo]], grandson of Governor-General Legazpi, led another expedition from the north. They founded Villa Santiago de Libon (present-day [[Libon, Albay]]) and reached the settlement of Albaybay, whose name was subsequently shortened to 'Albay' or ''Pueblo de Albay''. In 1616, Pueblo de Albay served as the capital of Partido de Ibalon, which included present-day Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate, parts of [[Camarines Sur]] and the islands of [[Catanduanes]], Ticao and Burias.<ref>{{cite web|title = Travel Albay " History of Albay|url = http://travelalbay.com/discover-albay/history-of-albay/|website = travelalbay.com|access-date = October 18, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070102/http://travelalbay.com/discover-albay/history-of-albay/|archive-date = March 4, 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>

===Spanish colonial era===
[[File:St. Gregory the Great Cathedral, Legazpi City.jpg|thumb|left|[[Legazpi Cathedral|St. Gregory the Great Cathedral]]]]
Spanish religious missionaries governed the settlement in the 1580s. In 1587, Franciscan friars of the ''Doctrina de Cagsawa'' began to convert the area's population to [[Christianity]]. The village of Sawangan became more populous and progressive and the first parish priest, Fray Francisco de Santa Ana, OFM, built a wooden chapel with [[St. Gregory the Great]] as patron. Sawangan then became an independent parish and was called ''Misión de San Gregorio Magno de Sawangan''.<ref name="Saint Gregory the Great Cathedral">{{cite web|title = Saint Gregory the Great Cathedral|url = http://g1d.me/saint-gregory-the-great-cathedral/|website = Digital Tourism|access-date = October 13, 2015}}</ref>

A bigger and more imposing church replaced the chapel during the tenure of Fray Martin del Espiritu OFM in 1636 and Sawangan continued to thrive despite the [[Moro people|Moro]] raids in the 1700s, a super typhoon in 1742, an earthquake in 1811, and other calamities.<ref name="Saint Gregory the Great Cathedral"/> Sawangan was created a visita regular in 1605 and elevated as an independent town in 1616.

====1814 Eruption of Mt. Mayon====
[[File:Oldcagsawapi2.jpg|thumb|Façade of the old church of Cagsawa, destroyed in the eruption of Mt. Mayon on February 1, 1814]]
On February 1, 1814, a catastrophic eruption of Mt. Mayon partially destroyed Sawangan and buried [[Cagsawa Ruins|Cagsawa]], Budiao and Camalig. The parish priest of Sawangan, Fray Pedro Licup, urged the residents to transfer to Makalaya (present-day Barangay Taysan) located on the slopes of Mt. Bariw. However, many residents decided to return to the lowlands and settled in Taytay (present-day Barangay Bagumbayan).

Other survivors opted to return to the original location of Sawangan and established Binanuahan (Banuang Gurang) despite a decree by the Gobierno Superior signed on October 1, 1829, which prohibited the establishment of new towns.<ref name="Saint Gregory the Great Cathedral" /> The new settlement in Taytay grew larger and eventually became a township. Binanuahan was declared a visita or tributary of Taytay and the combined town became known as Albay Nuevo.<ref name="visitmyphilippines.com">{{cite web|title = Department of Tourism – The Philippines Ultimate Travel Guide for Tourist|url = http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=LegazpiCity&Page=1&pid=772|website = www.visitmyphilippines.com|access-date = October 13, 2015|archive-date = March 4, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094034/http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=LegazpiCity&Page=1&pid=772|url-status = dead}}</ref>

In 1839, the settlers in Taytay started to erect a stone church designed by Gobernadorcillo Don Jose Ma. de Peñaranda, an architect, in consultation with Fray Jose Yagres, OFM. The structure would become the present [[Legazpi Cathedral|Cathedral of San Gregorio Magno]] in the Old Albay District. Meanwhile, those who returned to Sawangan established an ''ermita'' or chapel dedicated to the [[Raphael (archangel)|Archangel Raphael]], whom they adopted as patron saint. This became the present church of St. Raphael the Archangel in the Legazpi Port district.

On July 17, 1856, Governor General Ramon Montero signed a decree creating the township of Pueblo Viejo, out of Binanuahan and the adjacent villages of Lamba, Rawis and Bigaa. In another decree, Montero named the town Legazpi, which was formally established on October 22 of the same year, in honor of no less than Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governor General, who landed in the town's territories years before.

====Port of Legazpi opened to world trade====
The port of Legazpi served as anchorage for ships sailing to [[New Spain|Nueva España]] (Mexico) beginning in the latter part of the 16th century. The nearby Sula Channel was used as a sanctuary by galleons during storms because of its sheltered inlet. In 1873, Legazpi was made a port of entry by a Royal Decree earlier issued in Madrid on May 18, 1872, and later promulgated by Governor-General [[Juan Alaminos y Vivar]] on December 3, 1874.<ref name="Saint Gregory the Great Cathedral"/><ref>{{cite web|title=St. Raphael The Archangel Church|url=http://g1d.me/st-raphael-the-archangel-church/|website=Digital Tourism|access-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref>

Legazpi was declared a city for the first time under the Becerra Law of 1892.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsobicol.com/albay-tourism-stat/Legazpi%20City/Legaspi%20City.html|title=Quick Facts on Legazpi City|website=NSO Bicol Albay Tourism Weblink|access-date=October 2, 2015|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041330/http://www.nsobicol.com/albay-tourism-stat/Legazpi%20City/Legaspi%20City.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibálong: the Bikol folk epic-fragment : English and Bikol translation, views and comments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6ZkAAAAMAAJ&q=becerra+law+1892|publisher=M.C.

====Philippine revolution====
On September 22, 1898, the Civil Governor of Albay, Angel Bascaran y Federic and the Spanish residents evacuated Albay. Subsequently, a revolutionary junta was organized by Don Anacieto Solano who later turned over the command to General [[Vicente Lukban]], General-in-chief of Operations of the revolutionary government in the southern region.<ref name="visitmyphilippines.com"/>

===American colonial era===
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68156855.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Legazpi, circa 1930s]]
On January 23, 1900, American forces composed of three infantry companies equipped with powerful rifles and cannon landed on the shores of Albay Gulf to conquer Legazpi. They were met by 800 revolutionary Filipino troops headed by General [[Jose Ignacio Paua]], Col. Antero Reyes, Captain Alvaro Nepomuceno, and Policarpio Pergone who put up a strong defense of the city.<ref name="interaksyon.com">{{cite news|title = 115 years ago {{!}} Legazpi City commemorates 1900 battle against American invaders|url = http://www.interaksyon.com/article/103716/115-years-ago--legazpi-city-commemorates-1900-battle-against-american-invaders|work = InterAksyon|access-date = October 13, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151012142639/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/103716/115-years-ago--legazpi-city-commemorates-1900-battle-against-american-invaders|archive-date = October 12, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

The American troops, headed by Brig. Gen. [[William August Kobbé|W.A. Kobbe]], encountered heavy resistance from the Filipino forces who gallantly engaged them in a bloody fight on San Rafael Bridge that resulted in the death of 172 Filipinos including Reyes, who used only [[Bolo knife|bolos]]. Another 12 Filipinos were injured while the American forces suffered only 12 injured infantrymen.<ref name="interaksyon.com"/> To commemorate the valiant efforts of the revolutionary troops, a monument was built on the site of the former San Rafael Bridge. The swampy area where the bridge was located was reclaimed during the early 20th century and is now the intersection of Rizal Street and Quezon Avenue.

Following their occupation of the city in 1900, the American occupiers cancelled Legazpi's city status. In 1908, after the war's conclusion, the Americans split Legazpi into two separate towns, Legazpi and Albay (now Old Albay District), which became the provincial capital of Albay. In 1922, the town of Daraga was further split from the then municipality of Albay.

===World War II===
[[File:Type 97 Carrier Attack Bomber of the Ryujo.jpg|thumb|Japanese bombers from the aircraft carrier ''Ryujo'' attack Legazpi, December 12, 1941]]
On December 12, 1941, a few days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Legazpi was occupied by forces of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], the purpose of which was to obtain control of local airstrips which could be used as forward bases by fighter aircraft for operations in central Luzon. Throughout the Japanese occupation, resistance by Bicolano and local troops of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] continued in the hills and mountains south of Legazpi. In January 1945, American and Filipino liberation forces, supported by Bicolano guerrillas, liberated Legazpi. However, the city suffered extensive aerial bombardment from US aircraft and many old buildings were destroyed including the old St. Raphael church and the Academia de Santa Ines campus.

===Independent Philippines===
Legazpi became a city for the second time on July 18, 1948, when Daraga and Legazpi were combined to constitute its territory under Republic Act No. 306;<ref>{{cite web|title = PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|url = http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno306.html#.VhxlOexViko|website = www.chanrobles.com|access-date = October 13, 2015}}</ref> at that time, President [[Elpidio Quirino]] appointed Jose R.

==Geography==
[[File:Legazpi view from Lamba.jpg|thumb|View to the north from Barangay Lamba located in the hilly southern areas of Legazpi]]
Legazpi is on the eastern portion of the province of Albay bounded on the north by the municipality of [[Santo Domingo, Albay|Santo Domingo]], on the east by [[Albay Gulf]], on the west by the municipality of [[Daraga, Albay|Daraga]], and on the south by the municipalities of [[Manito, Albay]] and [[Pilar, Sorsogon|Pilar]] and [[Castilla, Sorsogon]]. The city is located {{convert|527|km}} south of Manila.

From north to south, the city spans approximately 29 kilometers; from east to west, the narrowest portion is about 3 kilometers (urban district) while the widest is about 15 kilometers (southeast area).<ref>{{cite web|title = legazpi|url = http://www.lchr.org/a/31/4o/legazpi.html|website = www.lchr.org|access-date = October 13, 2015}}</ref> Legazpi has a total land area of 20,437 hectares, 90 percent of which is classified as rural (18,431.66 hectares) while 10 percent is classified as urban (2,005.39 hectares).<ref>{{cite web|url =http://gwt04.grapikom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/leg_city_profile.pdf|title =Legazpi City Profile [PDF]|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150926165417/http://gwt04.grapikom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/leg_city_profile.pdf|archive-date =September 26, 2015|url-status =dead}}</ref>

Legazpi's topography is generally plain on the northeastern areas, with slopes ranging from five to fifteen degrees. The southern areas have mostly rolling to hilly terrain. In the city's coastal areas, the terrain varies from plain (north) to hilly (south).<ref>{{cite web|title = Bicol Situationer|url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/122696069/Bicol-Situationer#scribd|website = Scribd|access-date = October 13, 2015}}</ref> Legazpi is criss-crossed by several rivers including the Tibu, Macabalo and Yawa rivers with a number of swampy areas, particularly in the urban district. To mitigate flooding in these low-lying areas, the local government has built an urban drainage and flood control system consisting of dikes, canals, sea walls and three pumping stations located in Barangays San Roque, Bay-Bay and Victory Village.<ref>{{cite web|title = Ongoing works on Legazpi's urban drainage system impress DPWH chief|url = http://legazpi.gov.ph/ongoing-works-on-legazpis-urban-drainage-system-impress-dpwh-chief/|website = legazpi.gov.ph|access-date = October 13, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151121041700/http://legazpi.gov.ph/ongoing-works-on-legazpis-urban-drainage-system-impress-dpwh-chief/|archive-date = November 21, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Legazpi City – Ulat sa Bayan 2012: Ongoing projects -...|url = https://www.facebook.com/legazpicity/posts/277952642309854|website = Facebook|access-date = October 13, 2015}}</ref>

The festival features agricultural products display and trade fairs, culinary shows, cultural events, street parades, photo/arts exhibits, and sports events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.ph/sitepages/FestivitiesList.aspx?festivityCode=302&monthCode=04 |title=Calendar of Festivities : Magayon Festival ("Festival of Festivals Showdown) |website=Tourism.gov.ph |access-date=April 21, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316002908/http://tourism.gov.ph/sitepages/FestivitiesList.aspx?festivityCode=302&monthCode=04 |archive-date=March 16, 2016 }}</ref>
