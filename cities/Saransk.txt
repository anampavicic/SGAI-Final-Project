'''Saransk''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|s|ə|ˈ|r|æ|n|s|k}}, {{IPAc-en|US|s|ɑː|ˈ|r|ɑː|n|s|k}}){{efn|{{lang-rus|Саранск|p=sɐˈransk}}; {{lang-mdf|Саранск ошсь|Saransk oš}}; {{lang-myv|Саран ош|Saran oš}}}} is the [[capital city]] of [[Mordovia]], [[Russia]], as well as its financial and economic centre. It is located in the [[Volga River|Volga]] [[drainage basin|basin]] at the [[confluence]] of the Saranka and [[Insar River]]s, about {{convert|630|km|sp=us}} east of [[Moscow]]. Saransk was one of the host cities of the official tournament of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==History==
[[File:Saransk station 1893.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The first station, built in 1893]]
The Russian [[fortress]] [[Atemar]], founded in 1641,<ref name="Foundation"/> took its name from a nearby [[Mordvins|Mordvin]] village; at the time the fortress stood on the southeastern frontier of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. The current name, "Saransk", refers to the city's situation on the Saranka river. Soon after its founding, the city became an important trade centre for nearby [[Erzya people|Erzya]] villagers. After 1708 Saransk was assigned to Azov Province, and later to the [[Kazan Governorate]]. In 1780 the settlement was granted town status and was again transferred, this time to the [[Penza Governorate]], which was previously called the Penza Namestnichestvo, but was renamed to Penza Governorate by [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] in 1796. On 11 October 1797, the Penza Governorate was divided into several governorates, one of which was the [[Simbirsk Governorate]], which was composed of the Saransk and Insar [[uezd]]s. By the [[ukaz]] of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the Penza Governorate was re-established and now was divided into 10 uezds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://w.histrf.ru/articles/article/show/pienzienskaia_gubierniia|title=ПЕНЗЕНСКАЯ ГУБЕРНИЯ — информация на портале Энциклопедия Всемирная история|website=w.histrf.ru|access-date=November 24, 2018}}</ref>

In 1928 Saransk was the administrative centre of the newly established Mordvin National Okrug, which became the Mordovian Autonomous Oblast in 1930. In 1941 Saransk was near the front line in the Battle of Moscow, but was never reached by the Wehrmacht. Soviet planners reconstructed the old city centre in the 1960s and 1970s, adding wide streets and planning the construction of massive residential areas.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Saransk is the [[capital city|capital]] of the Mordovian republic.<ref name="Capital">Constitution of the Republic of Mordovia, Article&nbsp;109</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with three [[urban-type settlement|work settlements]] ([[Lukhovka]], [[Nikolayevka, Saransk, Republic of Mordovia|Nikolayevka]], and [[Yalga, Republic of Mordovia|Yalga]]) and thirteen [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the [[city of federal subject significance|city of republic significance]] of Saransk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of the Republic of Mordovia|districts]].<ref name="Ref112">Law #7-Z</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of republic significance of Saransk is incorporated as Saransk Urban Okrug.<ref name="Ref771">Law #114-Z</ref>

==Demographics==
{{Historical populations|1897|15000|1926|15000|1939|41146|1959|91034|1970|190575|1979|263337|1989|312128|2002|304866|2010|297415|2021|314871|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}Saransk is by far the largest city in Mordovia and accounts for 34.3% of the total population of the republic (as of the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]]). Ethnic Russians form the majority of the population (about 85%), and Russian, rather than any of the two co-official [[Mordvinic languages]], is the common language of communication in the city. As with many provincial capitals in Russia, the population of Saransk decreased after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, primarily as a result of economic migration to larger cities, made especially attractive by the downsizing, or outright collapse, of many smaller, regional, industrial enterprises. The population started to grow again in 2009. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=297,415|p2002=304,866|p1989=312,128}}

==Culture and religion==

==Cityscape and architecture==
{{See also|Squares of Saransk Center}}

The city has a large number of buildings remaining from the 17th and 18th centuries; however, many parts of the town are dominated by Soviet era apartment blocks, dating mainly from the 1960s, similar to other provincial towns which expanded rapidly due to fast industrialization. These buildings are nearing the end of their service life and are in need of serious repair and, in many cases, replacement. Industrial enterprises are mainly located to the north of the town center. The eastern part of Saransk, located east of the [[Insar River]], is Posop. An interesting detail is the Soviet era military base, belonging to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]], which is located along the railway lines and serves of a time when Saransk was, effectively, a [[closed city]]. Another city landmark is the Saransk TV Tower&nbsp;– a 180-meter-tall guyed tubular steel mast built in 1961.

It lies in the center of the city, near the [[Cathedral of St. Feodor Ushakov]], at the crossroads of Sovietskaya and the Democraticheskaya streets. It was opened in 2008, which was declared the Year of Family in Russia. The author of the monument is sculptor [[:ru:Филатов, Николай Михайлович (скульптор)|Nikolai Filatov]]. This monument is a symbol of absolute family values, the true foundation of society. The sculpture depicts a life-size large family; the husband with a little child on his shoulders, his pregnant wife, the mother of the children and two more children, holding on to their parents.

==Transportation==
[[File:Saransk trolleybus.jpg|thumb|[[Trolleybus]] on Pobedy Street in Saransk]]
The municipal transit system of Saransk consists primarily of a network of bus and [[trolleybus]] lines.

Saransk is serviced by one international federal airport, the [[Saransk Airport]] (IATA: SKX, ICAO: UWPS).
In January 2017, the airport was closed for renovation until the end of the year, as Saransk was chosen to serve as a host city to matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. After the renovation, the Airport's runway has been reinforced with asphalt concrete. The airport was expanded with a new permanent terminal with a passenger capacity of 300 people per hour for domestic flights (600 people per hour during the 2018 FIFA World Cup) and a temporary terminal for international flights with a passenger capacity of 360 people per hour. 
The airport has been cleared to service Boeing 737 CL\NG and Airbus A-319\320\321.
In 2018, the airport received its first scheduled flight after the renovation.
