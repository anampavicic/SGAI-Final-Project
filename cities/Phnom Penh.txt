It has been the national capital since the [[French protectorate of Cambodia]] and has grown to become the nation's [[primate city]] and its economic, industrial, and cultural centre. Before Phnom Penh became capital city, [[Oudong]] was the capital of the country. 

Phnom Penh succeeded [[Angkor Thom]] as the capital of the Khmer nation but was abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by [[Norodom of Cambodia|King Norodom]]. The city formerly functioned as a processing center, with textiles, pharmaceuticals, machine manufacturing, and rice milling. Its chief assets, however, were cultural. Institutions of higher learning included the [[Royal University of Phnom Penh]] (established in 1960 as Royal Khmer University), with schools of engineering, fine arts, technology, and agricultural sciences, the latter at Chamkar Daung, a suburb. Also located in Phnom Penh were the Royal University of Agronomic Sciences and the Agricultural School of Prek Leap.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |entry=Phnom Penh |entry-url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Phnom-Penh|access-date=2021-02-05|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Phnom Penh (lit. "Penh's hill") takes its name from the present [[Wat Phnom]] (lit. "hill temple"), or from the ancient [[Funan Kingdom]], which existed from the 1st to the 7th century AD in [[Southeast Asia]] and was  the forerunner of the current [[Cambodian monarchy]]. Legend has it that in 1372, a wealthy widow named [[Penh]] found a [[Aleurites moluccanus|Koki tree]] floating down the [[Tonlé Sap River]] after a storm.<ref name="roughguides.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/asia/cambodia/phnom-penh-around/|title=Phnom Penh and around Guide – Cambodia Travel|website=Rough Guides}}</ref> Inside the tree were four bronze [[Buddha]] statues and a stone statue of [[Vishnu]]. Penh ordered villagers to raise the height of the hill northeast of her house and used the Koki wood to build a temple on the hill to house the four Buddha statues, and a shrine for the Vishnu image slightly lower down. The temple became known as Wat Phnom Daun Penh, which is now known as Wat Phnom, a small hill {{convert|27|m}} in height.

Phnom Penh's former official name is '''Krong Chaktomuk Serei Mongkol''' ({{langx|km|ក្រុងចតុមុខសិរីមង្គល}}, lit. "city of [[Brahma]]'s faces"), in its short form as '''Krong Chaktomuk''' (lit. "city of four faces"). ''Krong Chaktomuk'' is an abbreviation of the full name, given to it by [[Ponhea Yat|King Ponhea Yat]]: ''Krong Chaktomuk Mongkol Sakal Kampuchea Thipadei Serei Theakreak Bavar Intabat Borei Roat Reach Seima Moha Nokor'' ({{langx|km|ក្រុងចតុមុខមង្គលសកលកម្ពុជាធិបតី សិរីធរបវរ ឥន្ទបត្តបុរី រដ្ឋរាជសីមាមហានគរ}} {{IPA-km|kɾoŋ catomuk mɔŋkɔl sakɑl kampuciətʰəpaɗəj serəj tʰeareaɓɑːʋɑː ʔenteapat ɓorəj rɔətʰariəcsəjmaː mɔhaːnɔkɔː|}}). This loosely translates as "the place of four rivers that gives the happiness and success of the Khmer Kingdom, the highest leader as well as impregnable city of the God [[Indra]] of the great kingdom".<ref>[http://sopheak.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/phnom-penh-full-name/ Sopheak wordpress]</ref>

==History==
The initial settlement of Phnom Penh is believed to have been established since the 5th century AD, according to the discovery of ancient kiln site in Choeung Ek commune of [[Khan Dangkao|Dangkao]] district, southern part of central Phnom Penh in the early 2000s. Choeung Ek archaeological site was one of the  largest kiln pottery center in Cambodia and the earliest known kiln sites in Southeast Asia to produce the ceremonial vessels known as kendi from 5th to 13th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia/phnom-penh/attractions/killing-fields-of-choeung-ek/a/poi-sig/441632/355881 | title=Killing Fields of Choeung Ek &#124; Phnom Penh, Cambodia &#124; Attractions }}</ref> Archaeologists stated that a large community is surrounded by a circular earthwork structure that is 740 metres in diameter and 4 metres high, built in the 11th century. In addition, there are remnants of other ancient village infrastructure, irrigation system, inscription, [[Lingam|Shiva linga]] as well as an ancient brick temple foundation and its ornate remains which dated back to [[Funan]] era.<ref name="Archaeological site" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ams.com.kh/khmercivilization/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/%E1%9E%9F%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%90%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%93%E1%9E%B8%E1%9E%99%E1%9E%94%E1%9E%BB%E1%9E%9A%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%8E%E1%9E%87%E1%9E%BE%E1%9E%84%E1%9E%AF%E1%9E%80.pdf|title=Choeung Ek archaeological site: The priceless cultural resource for national heritage of Cambodia.

First recorded a century after it is said to have taken place, the legend of the founding of Phnom Penh tells of a local woman, [[Penh]] (commonly referred to as ''Daun Penh'' (''Lady Penh'' in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), living at Chaktomuk, the future Phnom Penh. It was the late 14th century, and the Khmer capital was still at Angkor near Siem Reap {{cvt|350|km|0}} to the north. Gathering firewood along the banks of the river, Lady Penh spied a floating koki tree in the river and fished it from the water. Inside the tree she found four Buddha statues and one of Vishnu.[[File:Wat phnom1.jpg|thumb|Phnom Penh from east drawn in 1887.|alt=]][[File:Pagoda of Wat Phnom.jpg|thumb|Stupa of King [[Ponhea Yat]] on the top of Wat Phnom|alt=]]

The discovery was taken as a divine blessing, and to some a sign that the Khmer capital was to be brought to Phnom Penh from Angkor.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cambodia. Krasuaṅ Ghosanākār nẏṅ Vappadharm |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITxfsj1iE38C |title=Prajum rẏan breṅ Khmaer, Volume 5 |date=1990 |publisher=Buddha Sāsanapaṇdity, Original from [[University of California, Berkeley]] |language=km}}</ref> To house the new-found sacred objects, Penh raised a small hill on the west bank of the Tonle Sap River and crowned it with a shrine, now known as Wat Phnom at the north end of central Phnom Penh. "''Phnom''" is Khmer for "hill" and Penh's hill took on the name of the founder, and the area around it became known after the hill.

Phnom Penh first became the capital of Cambodia after [[Ponhea Yat]], king of the [[Khmer Empire]], moved the capital from [[Angkor Thom]] after it was captured and destroyed by [[Siam]] a few years earlier. There is a [[stupa]] behind Wat Phnom that houses the remains of Ponhea Yat and the royal family as well as the remaining [[Buddhist]] statues from the Angkorean era. In the 17th century, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants also settled on the outskirts of present-day Phnom Penh.<ref>Japan Times Online [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080216f2.html Researcher locates 17th-century Japanese village in Cambodia]. Retrieved January 20, 2009.</ref> A small [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] community survived in Phnom Penh until the 17th century, undertaking commercial and religious activity in the country.

Phnom Penh remained the royal capital for 73 years, from 1432 to 1505. It was abandoned for 360 years (from 1505 to 1865) by subsequent kings due to internal fighting between the royal [[pretender]]s. Later kings moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at various locations in Tuol Basan ([[Srey Santhor (town)|Srey Santhor]]), [[Pursat]], [[Lovek|Longvek]], Lavear Em and [[Oudong]].

It was not until 1866, under the reign of King [[Norodom of Cambodia|Norodom I]] (1860–1904), the eldest son of King [[Ang Duong]], who ruled on behalf of Siam, that Phnom Penh became the permanent seat of government and capital of Cambodia, and the current [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh|Royal Palace]] was built. Beginning in 1870, the [[Colonial Cambodia|French colonial authorities]] turned a riverside village into a city where they built hotels, schools, prisons, barracks, banks, public works offices, telegraph offices, law courts, and health services buildings. In 1872, the first glimpse of a modern city took shape when King Norodom employed the services of French contractor Le Faucheur to construct 300 brick houses for sale and rental to [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese traders]].

By the 1920s, Phnom Penh was known as the "Pearl of Asia", and over the next four decades, Phnom Penh continued to experience rapid growth with the building of railways to [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] and Pochentong International Airport (now [[Phnom Penh International Airport]]). Phnom Penh's infrastructure saw major modernisation under the rule of [[Norodom Sihanouk]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], Cambodia was used as a base by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] and the [[Viet Cong]], and thousands of refugees from across the country flooded the city to escape the fighting between their own government troops, the People's Army of Vietnam, the Viet Cong, the [[South Vietnam]]ese and their allies, the [[Khmer Rouge]], and American air strikes. By 1975, the population was 2–3&nbsp;million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting.<ref>Stuart-Fox, William, ''The Murderous Revolution: Life & Death in Pol Pot's Kampuchea'', Alternative Publishing Co-Operative Limited, 1985, pp. 17.</ref> The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it [[Fall of Phnom Penh|fell on 17 April 1975]].<ref name="roughguides.com"/> Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling "tortured the capital almost continuously", inflicting "random death and mutilation" on millions of trapped civilians.<ref>[[John Barron (American journalist)|Barron, John]] and Anthony Paul (1977), ''Murder of a Gentle Land'', Reader's Digest Press, pp. 1–2.</ref> The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a [[death march]]: [[François Ponchaud]] wrote that "I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin";<ref>Ponchaud, Francois (1978), ''Cambodia Year Zero'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, pp. 6–7.</ref> [[Jon Swain]] recalled that the Khmer Rouge were "tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen".<ref>Swain, John (1999), ''River of Time: A Memoir of Vietnam and Cambodia'', Berkley Trade.</ref> All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as "[[new people (Kampuchea)|new people]]".<ref>Stuart-Fox, pp. 7.</ref> Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by [[Pol Pot]]'s forces and was turned into the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|S-21]] prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, "lazy", spies, or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]], where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (the [[Killing Fields]]), {{convert|15|km|mi|0|sp=us}} away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime.

==Geography==

Phnom Penh is in the south-central region of Cambodia, and is fully surrounded by the [[Kandal province]]. The municipality is on the banks of the [[Tonlé Sap]], [[Mekong]], and [[Bassac River|Bassac]] Rivers. These rivers provide freshwater and other natural resources to the city. Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas consist of a typical [[Floodplain|flood plain]] area for Cambodia. Although Phnom Penh is at {{convert|11.89|m|ft|0}} above the river, monsoon season flooding is a problem, and the river sometimes overflows its banks.

The city, at {{Coord|11.55|N|104.91667|E|}} (11°33' North, 104°55' East),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |title=Names Files of Selected Countries |publisher=GEOnet Names Server |access-date=June 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050812023000/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |archive-date=August 12, 2005}}</ref> covers an area of {{convert|678.46|km2|sqmi|0}}, with some {{convert|11401|ha|acre|0}} in the municipality and {{cvt|26106|ha|acre|0}} of roads. The agricultural land in the municipality amounts to {{cvt|34.685|km2|sqmi|0}} with some {{cvt|1.476|km2|acre|0}} under [[irrigation]].

===Climate===
Phnom Penh has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw''). The climate is hot year-round with only minor variations. Temperatures typically range from {{convert|22|to|35|C|F|0}} and weather is subject to the tropical [[monsoon]]s. The southwest monsoon blows inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[Indian Ocean]] from May to November, sees high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. The dry season lasts from December to April; when overnight temperatures can drop to {{convert|22|C|F|0}}.

Phnom Penh is an autonomous municipality of area {{convert|678.46|km2}} with a government status equal to that of the provinces. The autonomous municipality is subdivided into 14 administrative divisions called ''[[Administrative divisions of Cambodia|khan]]s'' (sections). The district s are subdivided into 105 ''[[sangkat]]s'' (quarters), and further subdivided into 953 ''[[Administrative divisions of Cambodia|phum]]s'' (villages).<ref name="NCDD-gZ">{{Cite web|url=http://db.ncdd.gov.kh/gazetteer|title=Gazetteer Database Online|date=2019|website=Cambodia NCDD Databases|publisher=National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development |access-date=January 5, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20211113130228/http://db.ncdd.gov.kh/gazetteer/view/index.castle |archive-date= Nov 13, 2021 }}</ref>  All ''khans'' are under the governance of Phnom Penh.

Phnom Penh is Cambodia's economic centre as it accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years have triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh, with new hotels, restaurants, schools, bars, high rises and residential buildings springing up in the city.

The economy is based on commercial interests such as garments, trading, and small and medium enterprises. In the past few years the property business has been booming, with rapidly increasing real estate prices. Tourism is also a major contributor in the capital as more shopping and commercial centres open, making Phnom Penh one of the major tourist destinations in South East Asia along with [[Siem Reap]] and [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]]. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism made up 19.2 percent (US$2,053&nbsp;million) of Cambodia's GDP in 2009 and accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment.<ref>[http://www.clairebrownrealty.com/reports/Tourism%20for%20Economic%20Development%20in%20Cambodia%20-%20Media%20Global.pdf Tourism for Economic Development in Cambodia – Media Global] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101225641/http://www.clairebrownrealty.com/reports/Tourism%20for%20Economic%20Development%20in%20Cambodia%20-%20Media%20Global.pdf |date=November 1, 2013 }}, Claire Brown Report, April 17, 2011</ref> One of the most popular areas in Phnom Penh for tourists is [[Sisowath Quay]], alongside the Tonle Sap River. Sisowath Quay is a five kilometre strip of road that includes restaurants, bars, and hotels.<ref>[http://www.canbypublications.com/maps/phnompenhriverfront.htm Riverfront area, Phnom Penh, Cambodia], Candy Publications, April 17, 2011</ref>

The {{USD|2.6}} billion new urban development, [[Camko City]], is meant to bolster the city landscape. The Bureau of Urban Affairs of Phnom Penh Municipality has plans to expand and construct new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population and economy. High rise buildings will be constructed at the entrance of the city and near the lakes and riverbanks. Furthermore, new roads, canals, and a railway system will be used to connect Camko City and Phnom Penh.<ref>People's Daily Online [http://english.people.com.cn/200507/18/eng20050718_196801.html Cambodia unveils Phnom Penh development plan].

==Culture==
[[File:Driedphnompenhnoodles.jpg|thumb|right|"Dried" version of Phnom Penh noodles with soup broth on the side.]]
Phnom Penh also has its own dialect of [[Khmer language|Khmer]]. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often [[elide]] syllables, which has earned it a reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on [[New Khmer Architecture]]. Phnom Penh is notable for [[Ka tieu]] Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.

The city hosts a number of music events throughout the city. [[Indie band]]s have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as a [[non-governmental organization]]). The Cambodian fishing dance originated in Phnom Penh at the [[Royal University of Fine Arts]] in the 1960s.<ref>Khmer Traditional Dance and Shadow Theater. (n.d.). Canby Publications. Retrieved August 19, 2020, from https://www.canbypublications.com/siemreap/srothersr.htm</ref>

[[File:Khmer_folk_dance.JPG|thumb|right|The Cambodian fishing dance originated from Phnom Penh.]]
The two most visited museums in the city are the [[National Museum of Cambodia|National Museum]], which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]], a former Khmer Rouge prison. The [[National Museum of Cambodia|National Museum]] hosts celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic [[Apsara Dance|Apsara dance]] show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.

=== Cambodian New Year ===
{{main|Choul Chnam Thmey}}

At this time, Phnom Penh celebrates [[Cambodian New Year]], an occasion increasingly popular with tourists. During this typically hottest part of the year, water gets thrown around adding to the party atmosphere along with dancing and music. The precise date changes year-by-year but this holiday lasts, at least, three days. This festival marks the turn of the year based on the ancient Khmer calendar and also marks the end of the prior year harvest.

=== Water Festival ===
{{main|Bon Om Touk}}
[[File:Boat_Racing_Bon_Om_Touk.jpg|thumb|right|Colorful boats during [[Bon Om Touk]].]]
The largest annual festival in Phnom Penh, this lively gathering celebrates the reversing of the flow of the Tonlé Sap River. The holiday lasts three days as people flood into the city to enjoy the fireworks, boat races, live concerts, eating and partying. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the Khmer marine forces during the [[Khmer Empire]].

On 22 November 2010, at least 348 people were crushed to death in a [[Phnom Penh stampede|bridge stampede]] at the festival.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-world/cambodia-festival-stampede-leaves-almost-350-dead-20101123-184ew.html |location=Melbourne |work=The Age |first=Suy |last=Se |title=Cambodia festival stampede leaves almost 350 dead |date=November 23, 2010}}</ref>

=== Ancestors' Day ===
{{main|Pchum Ben}}

Ancestors' Day, also called Pchum Ben, is a very important aspect of Cambodian culture. It may be translated as "gathering together" to make offerings and is a time of reunion, commemoration, express love and appreciation for one's ancestors. By offering food and good karma to those possibly trapped in the spirit world, living relatives help assuage their misery and guide them back into the cycle of reincarnation.

=== Visak Bochea ===
{{main|Vesākha}}

Vesākha is an annual holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists in Cambodia. Sometimes informally called "Buddha's Birthday", it actually encompasses the birth, enlightenment (nirvāṇa), and passing away (Parinirvāna) of Gautama Buddha.

==Cityscape and architecture==
[[File:View of Phnom Penh from SVAY CHROM.jpg|thumb|Phnom Penh city at night]]
The oldest structure is [[Wat Phnom]] from the founding days of the city, constructed in 1373. The main tourist attractions are the [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh|Royal Palace]] with the [[Silver Pagoda, Phnom Penh|Silver Pagoda]], and the [[National Museum, Phnom Penh|National Museum]], constructed during the French colonial era in the late-19th century in the classical Khmer style and hosting a vast collection of Khmer antiquities. The [[Independence Monument, Phnom Penh|Independence Monument]] (Khmer: ''Vimean Akareach''), although from the 1950s, is also constructed in the ancient Khmer style.

The French, who were the colonial masters from the 19th century to the 1940s, also left their mark, with various colonial villas, French churches, [[boulevard]]s, and the [[Art Deco]] market [[Phsar Thom Thmei]]. A notable landmark of the colonial era is the [[Hotel Le Royal]].

Starting with independence from the French in the 1950s and lasting until the era of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Phnom Penh underwent tremendous growth as the capital city of a newly independent country. [[Sihanouk|King Sihanouk]] was eager to present a new style of architecture and thus invigorate the process of nation building. A new golden era of architecture took off, with various projects and young Khmer architects, often educated in France, given opportunities to design and construct. This new movement was called "[[New Khmer Architecture]]" and was often characterised by a fusion of [[Bauhaus]], European [[post-modern architecture]], and traditional elements from [[Angkor]]. The most prominent architect was [[Vann Molyvann]], who was nominated chief national architect by the king himself in 1956. Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the [[Preah Suramarit National Theatre]] or the [[Vann Molyvann House]]. Other architects helped construct the newly founded [[Royal Khmer University]], the Institute of Foreign Languages, and the National Sports Centre. With the growth of the upper and entrepreneurial middle [[File:Statue of Lady Penh.jpg|180px|thumb|Statue of [[Penh|Lady Penh]], the city's founder.|alt=]]classes, new suburbs were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Although these buildings survived the Khmer Rouge era and the civil war, today they are under threat due to economic development and financial speculation.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=NAM |first=SYLVIA |date=2011 |title=Phnom Penh: From the Politics of Ruin to the Possibilities of Return |journal=Traditional Dwellings and Settlements Review |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=55–68 |jstor=41758883 |issn=1050-2092}}</ref> Villas and gardens from that era are being destroyed and redeveloped to make place for bigger structures. The landmark National Theatre by Molyvann was razed in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ka-tours.org/|title=Khmer Architecture Tours|date=May 30, 2010|publisher=Ka-tours.org|access-date=June 27, 2010}}</ref> A movement is rising in Cambodia to preserve this modernist heritage. Old villas are sometimes being converted into [[boutique hotel]]s, such as the ''Knai Bang Chatt''.

Monuments and memorials to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era in the 1970s are the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] (a former high school used as a concentration camp) and, on the outskirts of the city, the [[Choeung Ek|Choeung Ek Genocide Center]]. The [[Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument]] was commissioned by the Vietnamese communists as symbol of Khmer-Vietnamese friendship during the late-1970s following the liberation of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge.

The population, foreign investment, and urban development in Phnom Penh grew dramatically during the 1990s and early-2000s. The rapid growth resulted in the city's infrastructure distinctly lacking (the drainage system is particularly notorious, and Phnom Penh frequently floods during the wet season), and a need for both residential and commercial spaces. The simultaneous demand for residential and commercial housing and the increase of international investment has led to the planning, if not construction, of several satellite cities. The largest of these cities are: Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town, and Chruy Cangva City.

On the outskirts of the city, farmland has been developed into garment factories and housing for lower economic classes and those displaced by the new development in the city center.

=== 2035 master plan ===
Originally intended to be completed by 2020, the 2035 master plan<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbda.org.kh/?p=1139|title=Phnom Penh master plan extended to 2035 {{!}} CBDA|website=www.cbda.org.kh|access-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref> is a French-funded project for the development of Phnom Penh. Although the plan was approved by the [[Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (Cambodia)|Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction]] in 2005, it has yet to be ratified by the [[Cabinet of Cambodia]]. The original plan details five edge-city projects connected to the historical city centre by waterways and tree-lined corridors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paling|first=Willem|year=2012|title=Planning a Future for Phnom Penh: Mega Projects, Aid Dependence and Disjointed Governance|journal=Urban Studies|volume=49|issue=13|pages=2889–2912|doi=10.1177/0042098012452457|bibcode=2012UrbSt..49.2889P |s2cid=154354673}}</ref>

[[Air France]] used to serve Phnom Penh from [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris-Charles de Gaulle]] but this service has since stopped. [[Qatar Airways]] now flies to and from Phnom Penh, via [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]].

Taxis, pick-ups, and minibuses leave the city for destinations all over the country, but are fast losing ground to cheaper and more comfortable buses. Phnom Penh also has a rail service.

There are numerous bus companies, including [[Phnom Penh Public Transport]] and [[GST Express]], running services to most provincial capitals, including Sihanoukville, [[Kampong Chhnang (town)|Kampong Chhnang]], [[Oudong]] and [[Takéo]]. [[Phnom Penh Sorya Transport]] Co. offers bus service to several provincial destinations along the National Routes and to [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]]. Giant Ibis is another bus company based in Phnom Penh, which travels to Sihanoukville, Kampot, Siem Reap and [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], and has free [[Wi-Fi]], air conditioning and modest pricing.

The city is Cambodia's main freshwater port, a major port on the [[Mekong River]]. It is linked to the [[South China Sea]], 290 kilometres distant, via a channel of the Mekong in [[Vietnam]].
