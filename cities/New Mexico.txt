==Etymology==

New Mexico received its name long before the present-day country of Mexico won independence from Spain and adopted that name in 1821. The name "Mexico" derives from [[Nahuatl]] and originally referred to the heartland of the [[Mexica]], the rulers of the [[Aztec Empire]], in the [[Valley of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin |first1=Don Domingo de San Antón Muñón |editor1-last=Namala |editor1-first=Doris |editor2-last=Lockhart |editor2-first=James |editor3-last=Schroeder |editor3-first=Susan |title=Annals of His Time: Don Domingo de San Antón Muñón Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin |date=2006 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804754545 |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRFcH0HWrJ4C&dq=yancuic%20mexico&pg=PA144 |quote=inchan yn ompa huehue mexico aztlan quinehuayan chicomoztoc yn axcan quitocayotia yancuic mexico |access-date=June 3, 2023 |archive-date=June 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230612153725/https://books.google.com/books?id=GRFcH0HWrJ4C&dq=yancuic%20mexico&pg=PA144 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yancuic Mexico |url=https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/content/yancuic-mexico |website=Online Nahuatl Dictionary |publisher=Wired Humanities Projects, University of Oregon |access-date=May 14, 2023 |archive-date=May 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230514224110/https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/content/yancuic-mexico |url-status=live }}</ref> Following their [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztecs]] in the early 16th century, the Spanish began exploring what is now the Southwestern United States calling it ''Nuevo México''.

Before statehood in 1912, the name "New Mexico" loosely applied to various configurations of territories in the same general area, which [[Territorial evolution of New Mexico|evolved throughout the Spanish, Mexican, and U.S. periods]], but typically encompassed most of present-day New Mexico along with sections of neighboring states.<ref>Rivera, José A., ''Acequia Culture: Water, Land, and Community in the Southwest'', University of New Mexico Press, 1998.</ref>

The vast trade networks of the Ancestral Puebloans led to legends throughout [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Aztec Empire]] ([[Mexica|Mexico]]) of an unseen northern empire that rivaled their own, which they called ''Yancuic Mexico'', literally translated as "a new Mexico".

During most of the 18th century, raids by [[Navajo]], [[Apache]], and especially [[Comanche]] inhibited the growth and prosperity of the New Mexico. The region's harsh environment and remoteness, surrounded by hostile Native Americans, fostered a greater degree of self-reliance, as well as pragmatic cooperation, between the [[Pueblo people]]s and colonists. Many indigenous communities enjoyed a large measure of autonomy well into the late 19th century due to the improved governance.

To encourage settlement in its vulnerable periphery, Spain awarded land grants to European settlers in Nuevo México; due to the scarcity of water throughout the region, the vast majority of colonists resided in the central valley of the Rio Grande and its tributaries. Most communities were walled enclaves consisting of adobe houses that opened onto a plaza, from which four streets ran outward to small, private agricultural plots and orchards; these were watered by ''[[acequia]]s,'' community owned and operated irrigation canals. Just beyond the wall was the ''[[ejido]]'', communal land for grazing, firewood, or recreation.

==== Mexico era ====
[[File: Santa Fe of New Mexico (location map scheme).svg|thumb|Territory of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]] when it belonged to Mexico in 1824]]

As part of New Spain, the province of New Mexico became part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] in 1821 following the [[Mexican War of Independence]].<ref name="Simmons 1988" />{{Rp|109}} Upon its secession from Mexico in 1836, the [[Republic of Texas]] claimed the portion east of the [[Rio Grande]], based on the erroneous assumption that the older Hispanic settlements of the upper Rio Grande were the same as the newly established Mexican settlements of Texas. The [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]] was launched to seize the contested territory but failed with the capture and imprisonment of the entire army by the Hispanic New Mexico militia.

During the turn of the 19th century, the extreme northeastern part of New Mexico, north of the Canadian River and east of the spine of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, was still claimed by France, which sold it in 1803 as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In 1812, the U.S. reclassified the land as part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. This region of New Mexico (along with territory comprising present-day southeastern Colorado, the [[Texas Panhandle|Texas]] and [[Oklahoma Panhandle]]s, and southwestern [[Kansas]]) was ceded to Spain under the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] in 1819.

When the [[First Mexican Republic]] began to transition into the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico]], they began to centralize power ignoring the sovereignty of Santa Fe and disregarding Pueblo land rights. This led to the [[Revolt of 1837 (New Mexico)|Chimayó Rebellion]] in 1837, led by ''[[genízaro]]'' José Gonzales.<ref name="Lecompte 1985 p.">{{cite book | last=Lecompte | first=Janet | title=Rebellion in Río Arriba, 1837 | publisher=University of New Mexico Press | publication-place=Albuquerque | date=1985 | isbn=0-8263-0800-7 | oclc=11549193 | language=de | page=}}</ref> The death of then governor [[Albino Pérez]] during the revolt, was met with further hostility. Though José Gonzales was executed due to his involvement in the governor's death, subsequent governors [[Manuel Armijo]] and [[Juan Bautista Vigil y Alarid]] agreed with some of the underlying sentiment. This led to New Mexico becoming financially and politically tied to the U.S., and preferring trade along the [[Santa Fe Trail]].

When the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] broke out in 1861, both [[the Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] governments claimed ownership and territorial rights over New Mexico Territory. The Confederacy claimed the southern tract as its own [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Arizona Territory]], and as part of the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theater]] of the war, waged the ambitious [[New Mexico Campaign]] to control the [[American Southwest]] and open up access to Union California. Confederate power in the New Mexico Territory was effectively broken after the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] in 1862, though the Confederate territorial government continued to operate out of Texas.

The influx of "Anglo Americans" from the eastern U.S. (which include African Americans and recent European immigrants) reshaped the state's economy, culture, and politics. Into the late 19th century, the majority of New Mexicans remained ethnic mestizos of mixed Spanish and Native American ancestry (primarily Pueblo, Navajo, Apache, Genízaro, and Comanche), many of whom had roots going back to Spanish settlement in the 16th century; this distinctly New Mexican ethnic group became known as [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispanos]] and developed a more pronounced identity vis-a-vis the newer Anglo arrivals. Politically, they still controlled most town and county offices through local elections, and wealthy ranching families commanded considerable influence, preferring business, [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] relations with fellow indigenous New Mexican groups. By contrast, Anglo Americans, who were "outnumbered, but well-organized and growing"<ref name="Montgomery">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27502746?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents Charles Montgomery, "Becoming 'Spanish-American': Race and Rhetoric in New Mexico Politics, 1880–1928"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107003618/http://www.jstor.org/stable/27502746?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents|date=November 7, 2016}}, ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' Vol. 20, No. 4 (Summer, 2001), pp. 59–84 (published by University of Illinois Press for Immigration and Ethnic History Society); accessed via JSTOR, July 20, 2016,</ref> tended to have more ties to the territorial government, whose officials were appointed by the U.S. federal government; subsequently, newer residents of New Mexico generally favored maintaining territorial status, which they saw as a check on Native and Hispano influence.

A consequence of the civil war was intensifying conflict with indigenous peoples, which was part of the broader American [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]] along the frontier. The withdrawal of troops and material for the war effort had prompted raids by hostile tribes, and the federal government moved to subdue the many native communities that had been effectively autonomous throughout the colonial period. Following the elimination of the Confederate threat, Brigadier General [[James Henry Carleton|James Carleton]], who had assumed command of the Military Department of New Mexico in 1862, led what he described as a "merciless war against all hostile tribes" that aimed to "force them to their knees, and then confine them to reservations where they could be Christianized and instructed in agriculture."<ref name="online.nmartmuseum.org"/> With famed frontiersman [[Kit Carson]] placed in charge of troops in the field, powerful indigenous groups such as the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Mescalero]] Apache, [[Kiowa]], and [[Comanche]] were brutally pacified through a scorched earth policy, and thereafter forced into barren and remote reservations. Sporadic conflicts continued into the late 1880s, most notably [[Victorio's War|the guerilla campaigns]] led by Apache [[Victorio|chiefs Victorio]] and his son-in-law [[Nana (chief)|Nana]].

The political and cultural clashes between these competing ethnic groups sometimes culminated in mob violence, including lynchings of Native, Hispanic, and Mexican peoples, as was attempted at the [[Frisco shootout]] in 1884. Nevertheless, prominent figures from across these communities, and from both the [[Democratic Party of New Mexico|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party of New Mexico|Republican parties]], attempted to fight this prejudice and forge a more cohesive, multiethnic New Mexican identity; they include lawmen [[Elfego Baca|Baca]] and [[Pat Garrett|Garrett]], and governors [[George Curry (politician)|Curry]], [[Herbert James Hagerman|Hagerman]], and [[Miguel Antonio Otero (born 1859)|Otero]].<ref name="Van Holtby 2012 p.">{{cite book | last=Van Holtby | first=D. | title=Forty-Seventh Star: New Mexico's Struggle for Statehood | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | year=2012 | isbn=978-0806187860 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4q7f6wSqlEC | access-date=April 23, 2021 | page=}}</ref><ref name="de Aragón 2020 p.">{{cite book | last=de Aragón | first=R.J. | title=New Mexico's Stolen Lands: A History of Racism, Fraud & Deceit | publisher=History Press | year=2020 | isbn=978-1467144032 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsHDDwAAQBAJ | access-date=April 23, 2021 | page=}}</ref> Indeed, some territorial governors, like [[Lew Wallace]], had served in both the Mexican and American militaries.<ref name="Cain 2019">{{cite web | last=Cain | first=Stephanie | title=Lew Wallace in Mexico | website=General Lew Wallace Study & Museum | date=May 10, 2019 | url=https://www.ben-hur.com/lew-wallace-in-mexico/ | access-date=December 16, 2022 | archive-date=December 9, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221209114856/https://www.ben-hur.com/lew-wallace-in-mexico/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

New Mexico was [[New Mexico during World War II|greatly transformed]] by the U.S. entry into the [[Second World War]] in December 1941. As in the First World War, [[Patriotism in the United States|patriotism]] ran high among New Mexicans, including among marginalized Hispanic and indigenous communities; on a per capita basis, New Mexico produced more volunteers, and suffered more casualties, than any other state. The war also spurred economic development, particularly in extractive industries, with the state becoming a leading supplier of several strategic resources. New Mexico's rough terrain and geographic isolation made it an attractive location for several sensitive military and scientific installations; the most famous was [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]], one of the central facilities of the [[Manhattan Project]], where the first [[atomic bomb]]s were designed and manufactured. The first bomb was tested at [[Trinity site]] in the desert between [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]], which is today part of the [[White Sands Missile Range]].<ref name="Simmons 1988" />{{Rp|179–180}}

As a legacy of the Second World War, New Mexico continues to receive large amounts of federal government spending on major military and research institutions. In addition to the White Sands Missile Range, the state hosts three U.S. Air Force bases that were established or expanded during the war. While the high military presence brought considerable investment, it has also been the center of controversy; on May 22, 1957, a B-36 [[Mark 17 nuclear bomb#1957 incident|accidentally dropped]] a nuclear bomb 4.5 miles from the control tower while landing at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in Albuquerque; only its conventional "trigger" detonated.<ref>Adler, Les.

Native Americans from New Mexico fought for the United States in both world wars. Returning veterans were disappointed to find their civil rights limited by state discrimination. In Arizona and New Mexico, veterans challenged state laws or practices prohibiting them from voting. In 1948, after veteran Miguel Trujillo Sr. of [[Isleta Pueblo]] was told by the county registrar that he could not register to vote, he filed suit against the county in federal district court. A three-judge panel overturned as unconstitutional New Mexico's provisions that Native Americans who did not pay taxes (and could not document if they had paid taxes) could not vote.<ref name="suffrage" /><ref group="Note">"Any other citizen, regardless of race, in the State of New Mexico who has not paid one cent of tax of any kind or character, if he possesses the other qualifications, may vote.

The [[Great Plains]] extend into the eastern third of the state, most notably the [[Llano Estacado]] ("Staked Plain"), whose westernmost boundary is marked by the [[Mescalero Ridge]] [[Caprock Escarpment|escarpment]]. The northwestern quadrant of New Mexico is dominated by the [[Colorado Plateau]], characterized by unique volcanic formations, dry grasslands and shrublands, open [[pinyon-juniper woodland]], and mountain forests.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Colorado Plateau shrublands {{!}} Ecoregions {{!}} WWF|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/na1304|access-date=2021-08-03|website=World Wildlife Fund|language=en|archive-date=August 3, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803033930/https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/na1304|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Chihuahuan Desert]], which is the largest in North America, extends through the south.

Over four–fifths of New Mexico is higher than {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level. The average elevation ranges from up to {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level in the northwest, to less than 4,000 feet in the southeast.<ref name="britannica.com" /> The highest point is [[Wheeler Peak (New Mexico)|Wheeler Peak]] at over {{convert|13160|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, while the lowest is the [[Red Bluff Reservoir]] at around {{convert|2840|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, in the southeastern corner of the state.

In addition to the Rio Grande, which is tied for the [[List of rivers of the United States|fourth-longest river in the U.S.]], New Mexico has four other major river systems: the [[Pecos River|Pecos]], [[Canadian River|Canadian]], [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]], and [[Gila River|Gila]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/riversofworld.html|title=Rivers of the World|publisher=USGS|access-date=May 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305045437/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/riversofworld.html|archive-date=March 5, 2009}}</ref> Nearly bisecting New Mexico from north to south, the Rio Grande has played an influential role in the region's history; its fertile floodplain has supported human habitation since prehistoric times, and European settlers initially lived exclusively in its valleys and along its tributaries.<ref name="britannica.com" /> The Pecos, which flows roughly parallel to the Rio Grande at its east, was a popular route for explorers, as was the Canadian River, which rises in the mountainous north and flows east across the arid plains. The San Juan and Gila lie west of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], in the northwest and southwest, respectively. With the exception of the Gila, all major rivers are dammed in New Mexico and provide a major water source for [[irrigation]] and flood control.

===Climate===
New Mexico has long been known for its dry, temperate climate.<ref name="britannica.com" /> Overall the state is semi-arid to arid, with areas of continental and alpine climates at higher elevations. New Mexico's statewide average precipitation is {{convert|13.7|in|mm}} a year, with average monthly amounts peaking in the summer, particularly in the more rugged north-central area around Albuquerque and in the south. Generally, the eastern third of the state receives the most rainfall, while the western third receives the least. Higher altitudes receive around {{convert|40|in|mm}}, while the lowest elevations see as little as {{convert|8|to|10|in|mm|abbr=off}}.<ref name="britannica.com" />

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Geococcyx californianus.jpg|thumb|[[Greater roadrunner]] (the state bird of New Mexico)]]
Owing to its varied [[topography]], New Mexico has six distinct [[Vegetation zone (latitude)|vegetation zones]] that provide diverse sets of habitats for many plants and animals.<ref name="Beck-McNamee-2023a">{{Cite encyclopedia|entry=New Mexico – Climate|entry-url=https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico|access-date=2021-08-03|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=October 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231012085307/https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico|url-status=live}}</ref> The Upper Sonoran Zone is by far the most prominent, constituting about three-fourths of the state; it includes most of the plains, foothills, and valleys above 4,500 feet, and is defined by prairie grasses, low piñon pines, and juniper shrubs. The [[Llano Estacado]] in the east features [[Shortgrass Prairie]] with [[Bouteloua gracilis|blue grama]], which sustain [[American bison|bison]]. The [[Chihuahuan Desert]] in the south is characterized by shrubby [[Larrea tridentata|creosote]]. The [[Colorado Plateau]] in the northwest corner of New Mexico is high desert with cold winters, featuring [[Artemisia tridentata|sagebrush]], [[Atriplex confertifolia|shadescale]], [[Sarcobatus|greasewood]], and other plants adapted to the [[Soil salinity|saline]] and [[Selenium|seleniferous]] soil.

The mountainous north hosts a wide array of vegetation types corresponding to elevation gradients, such as [[Pinyon-juniper woodland|piñon-juniper woodlands]] near the base, through [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[spruce]]-[[fir]] and [[aspen]] forests in the transitionary zone, and [[Krummholz]], and [[alpine tundra]] at the very top.<ref name="Beck-McNamee-2023a" /> The [[Madrean Region|Apachian zone]] tucked into the southwestern bootheel of the state has high-calcium soil, [[Madrean pine-oak woodlands|oak woodlands]], [[Cupressus arizonica|Arizona cypress]], and other plants that are not found in other parts of the state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lowrey|first1=Timothy K.|title=Flora of New Mexico: Biology 463|date=2017|publisher=University of New Mexico|pages=88–162}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ivey |first1=Robert DeWitt |title=Flowering plants of New Mexico |date=2008 |publisher=RD & V Ivey |location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0961217044 |edition=5th}}</ref> The southern sections of the Rio Grande and Pecos valleys have {{convert|20000|mi2|km2|abbr=off}} of New Mexico's best grazing land and irrigated farmland.

New Mexico's varied climate and vegetation zones consequently support diverse wildlife. [[American black bear|Black bears]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[bobcat]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[deer]], and [[elk]] live in habitats above 7,000 feet, while [[coyote]]s, [[jackrabbit]]s, [[kangaroo rat]]s, [[Peccary|javelina]], [[porcupine]]s, [[pronghorn|pronghorn antelope]], [[Crotalus atrox|western diamondbacks]], and [[wild turkey]]s live in less mountainous and elevated regions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Florence|last=Merriam Bailey|year=1928|title=Birds of New Mexico|publisher=The University of Michigan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=C.

=== Conservation ===
New Mexico and 12 other western states together account for 93% of all federally owned land in the U.S. Roughly one–third of the state, or 24.7&nbsp;million of 77.8&nbsp;million acres, is held by the U.S. government, the tenth-highest percentage in the country. More than half this land is under the [[Bureau of Land Management]] as either [[Public domain (land)|public domain land]] or [[National Conservation Lands]], while another third is managed by the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] as [[National forest (United States)|national forests]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Find a Forest by State|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/map/state_list.shtml#NewMexico|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620110003/http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/map/state_list.shtml#NewMexico|archive-date=June 20, 2013|access-date=March 20, 2010|publisher=USDA Forest Service}}</ref>

[[File:New Mexico population map.png|thumb|left|New Mexico population density map]]With just {{convert|17|/sqmi|/km2|disp=preunit|people&nbsp;|people|abbr=out}}, New Mexico is one of the [[List of states and territories of the United States by population density|least densely populated states]], ranking 45th out of 50; by contrast, the overall population density of the U.S. is {{convert|90|/sqmi|/km2|disp=preunit|people&nbsp;|people|abbr=out}}. The state is divided into 33 counties and 106 municipalities, which include cities, towns, villages, and a [[City-County|consolidated city-county]], [[Los Alamos County, New Mexico|Los Alamos]]. Only three cities have at least 100,000 residents: Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Las Cruces, whose respective metropolitan areas together account for the majority of New Mexico's population.

Residents are concentrated in the north-central region of New Mexico, anchored by the state's largest city, Albuquerque. Centered in [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]], the [[Albuquerque metropolitan area]] includes New Mexico's third-largest city, [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]], and has a population of over 918,000, accounting for one-third of all New Mexicans. It is adjacent to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], the capital and fourth-largest city. Altogether, the [[Albuquerque–Santa Fe–Los Alamos combined statistical area]] includes more than 1.17&nbsp;million people, or nearly 60% of the state population.

New Mexico's other major center of population is in south-central area around [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], its second-largest city and the largest city in the southern region of the state. The Las Cruces metropolitan area includes roughly 214,000 residents, but with neighboring [[El Paso, Texas]] forms a [[El Paso–Las Cruces, Texas–New Mexico, combined statistical area|combined statistical area]] numbering over 1 million.<ref>"Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018 – United States – Combined Statistical Area; and for Puerto Rico".

New Mexico hosts 23 federally recognized tribal reservations, including part of the Navajo Nation, the largest and most populous tribe; of these, 11 hold [[off-reservation trust land]]s elsewhere in the state. The vast majority of federally recognized tribes are concentrated in the northwest, followed by the north-central region.

Like several other southwestern states, New Mexico hosts numerous [[Colonia (United States)|''colonias'']], [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]], low-income [[slum]]s characterized by abject poverty, the absence of basic services (such as water and sewage), and scarce housing and infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NM Colonias|url=https://bber.unm.edu/colonias|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220204195209/https://bber.unm.edu/colonias|archive-date=February 4, 2022|access-date=2021-08-07|website=Bureau of Business and Economic Research UNM|publisher=[[University of New Mexico]]}}</ref> The University of New Mexico estimates there are 118 colonias in the state, though the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] identifies roughly 150.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 2, 2015|title=Colonias History|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/communitydevelopment/programs/colonias/history|access-date=2021-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602094150/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fcomm_planning%2Fcommunitydevelopment%2Fprograms%2Fcolonias%2Fhistory|archive-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The majority are located along the [[U.S.-Mexico border|Mexico-U.S. border.]]

Besides Navajo, which is also spoken in Arizona, several other [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] are spoken by smaller groups in New Mexico, most of which are endemic to the state. Native New Mexican languages include [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language|Mescalero Apache]], [[Jicarilla language|Jicarilla Apache]], [[Tewa language|Tewa]], [[Southern Tiwa language|Southern Tiwa]], [[Northern Tiwa]], [[Jemez language|Towa]], [[Keres language|Keres]] (Eastern and Western), and [[Zuni language|Zuni]]. Mescalero and Jicarilla Apache are closely related [[Southern Athabaskan languages]], and both are also related to Navajo. Tewa, the Tiwa languages, and Towa belong to the [[Tanoan languages|Kiowa-Tanoan]] language family, and thus all descend from a [[Language family|common ancestor]]. Keres and Zuni are [[language isolate]]s with no relatives outside of New Mexico.

=== Agriculture and food production ===
Although much of its land is arid, New Mexico has hosted a variety of agricultural activities for at least 2,500 years, centered mostly on the Rio Grande and its tributaries. This is helped by its long history of [[acequia]]s, along with other farming and ranching methods within New Mexico. It is regulated by the [[New Mexico Department of Agriculture]], specialty areas include various [[cash crop]]s, [[cattle ranching]], farming, [[New Mexico Department of Game and Fish|game and fish]].

Agriculture contributes $40&nbsp;billion to New Mexico's economy and employs nearly 260,000 people.

=== Tourism ===
New Mexico's distinctive culture, rich artistic scene, favorable climate, and diverse geography have long been major drivers of tourism.

====Economic incentives====
New Mexico provides a number of economic incentives to businesses operating in the state, including various types of [[tax credits]] and [[tax exemptions]]. Most incentives are based on job creation: state and local governments are permitted to provide land, buildings, and infrastructure to businesses that will generate employment.<ref>

New Mexico imposes a [[Gross Receipts Tax]] (GRT) on many transactions, which may even include some governmental receipts. This resembles a [[sales tax]] but, unlike the sales taxes in many states, it applies to services as well as tangible goods. Normally, the provider or seller passes the tax on to the purchaser; however, legal incidence and burden apply to the business, as an [[excise tax]]. GRT is imposed by [[New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department|the state]] and by some counties and municipalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/GrossReceiptsTaxFAQ.pdf |title=Gross Receipts Taxes FAQ |access-date=October 9, 2008 |publisher=State of New Mexico, Taxation and Revenue Department |date=August 6, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331014708/http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/GrossReceiptsTaxFAQ.pdf |archive-date=March 31, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As of 2021, the combined tax rate ranged from 5.125% to 9.063%.<ref>[http://www.tax.newmexico.gov/Forms-and-Publications/Forms/Gross-Receipts/Pages/Home.aspx#Rates.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024210432/http://www.tax.newmexico.gov/Forms-and-Publications/Forms/Gross-Receipts/Pages/Home.aspx#Rates.aspx|date=October 24, 2013}}</ref>

[[Property tax]] is imposed on [[real property]] by the state, by counties, and by school districts. In general, personal use [[personal property]] is not subject to property taxation. On the other hand, property tax is levied on most business-use personal property. The taxable value of property is one-third the assessed value. A tax rate of about 30 [[mill (currency)|mills]] is applied to the taxable value, resulting in an effective tax rate of about 1%. In the 2005 tax year, the average millage was about 26.47 for residential property, and 29.80 for non-residential property. Assessed values of residences cannot be increased by more than 3% per year unless the residence is remodeled or sold. Property tax deductions are available for military veterans and heads of household.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/PropertyTaxFAQ.pdf |title=Property Tax FAQ |access-date=October 9, 2008 |publisher=State of New Mexico, Taxation and Revenue Department |date=August 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331014658/http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/PropertyTaxFAQ.pdf |archive-date=March 31, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The pre-[[Christopher Columbus|Columbian]] trade with [[Mesoamerican cultures]] included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper. Turquoise, pottery, and salt were some of the goods transported south along the [[Rio Grande]]. Present-day New Mexico's pre-Columbian trade is especially remarkable for being undertaken on foot. The north–south trade route later became a path for horse-drawn colonists arriving from [[New Spain]] as well as trade and communication; later called ''[[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]],'' it was among the four "royal roads" that were crucial lifelines to Spanish colonial possessions in North America.<ref name="Suina">{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicohistory.org/story2.php?catid=727 |title=Indigenous trade |last=Suina |first=Kim |website=Digital History Project{{snd}}Book of Migrations |publisher=New Mexico Office of the State Historian |access-date=March 31, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903153033/http://www.newmexicohistory.org/story2.php?catid=727 |archive-date=September 3, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another transcontinental railroad was completed by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]. The railroads essentially replaced the earlier trails but prompted a population boom. Early transcontinental [[auto trail]]s later crossed the state, bringing more migrants. Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of highways and airports. Today, New Mexico's [[Interstate Highway]]s approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads.

New Mexico currently has [[List of U.S. Routes in New Mexico|15 United States Highways]], which account for over {{convert|2980|mi|km}} of its highway system. All but seven of its 33 counties are served by U.S. routes, with most of the remainder connected by Interstate Highways. Most routes were built in 1926 by the state government and are still managed and maintained by state or local authorities. The longest is [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|U.S. 70]], which spans over {{convert|448|mi|km}} across southern New Mexico, making up roughly 15% of the state's total U.S. Highway length; the shortest is [[U.S. Route 160 in New Mexico|U.S. 160]], which runs just {{convert|0.86|mi|km}} across the [[Four Corners|northwestern]] corner of the state, between the [[Arizona]] and [[Colorado]] borders.

The most famous route in New Mexico, if not the United States, was [[U.S. Route 66|U.S. 66]], colloquially known as the nation's "Mother Road" for its scenic beauty and importance to migrants fleeing West from the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 31, 2014|title=On What's Left of America's 'Mother Road,' Remnants of Road Trips and Migrations|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/141230-dust-bowl-grapes-of-wrath-drought-migrants-family-trip-route-66-part-2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605051239/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/141230-dust-bowl-grapes-of-wrath-drought-migrants-family-trip-route-66-part-2|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 5, 2021|access-date=2021-08-01|website=Science|language=en}}</ref> The road crossed through [[northern New Mexico]], connecting the cities of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Gallup, New Mexico|Gallup]], before being replaced by I-40 in 1985.

It was known as the "Devil's Highway" due to the number [[666 (number)|666]] denoting the "[[Number of the beast]]" in Christianity; this numerical designation, as well as its high fatality rate was subject to controversy, superstition, and numerous cultural references. U.S. 666 was subsequently renamed U.S. Route 491 in 2003.

New Mexico has four [[List of airports in New Mexico|primary commercial airports]] that are served by most major domestic and international airliners. [[Albuquerque International Sunport]] is the state's main [[Port of entry|aerial port of entry]] and by far the largest airport: It is the only one designated a medium-sized hub by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], serving millions of passengers annually.
[[File:Spaceport America terminal - The Gateway (15094090585).jpg|thumb|223x223px|Spaceport America terminal, ''The Gateway'']]
The only other comparatively large airports are [[Lea County Regional Airport]], [[Roswell International Air Center]], and [[Santa Fe Regional Airport]], which have varying degrees of service by major airlines. Most airports in New Mexico are small, [[general aviation]] hubs operated by municipal and county governments, and usually served solely by local and regional [[Regional airliner|commuter airlines]].

Due to its sparse population and many isolated, rural communities, New Mexico ranks among the states most reliant on [[Essential Air Service]], a federal program that maintains a minimal level of scheduled air service to communities that are otherwise unprofitable for commercial airlines.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of New Mexico}}
[[File:Michelle Lujan Grisham 2021.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Michelle Lujan Grisham]] (D)]]

The [[Constitution of New Mexico]] was adopted by [[referendum|popular referendum]] in 1911. It establishes a [[republican form of government]] based on [[popular sovereignty]] and a [[separation of powers]]. New Mexico has a [[bill of rights]] modeled on its [[United States Bill of Rights|federal counterpart]], but with more expansive rights and freedoms; for example, victims of certain serious crimes, such as aggravated battery and sexual assault, have explicit rights to privacy, dignity, and the timely adjudication of their case.<ref>[[Constitution of New Mexico]], Sec. 24.</ref> Major state issues may be decided by popular vote, and the constitution may be amended by a majority vote of both lawmakers and the electorate.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite encyclopedia|entry=New Mexico – Government and society|entry-url=https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico|access-date=2021-08-03|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=October 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231012085307/https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Governmental structure ===
[[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Mirroring the federal system]], the New Mexico government consists of executive, legislative, and judicial departments. The executive is led by the [[Governor of New Mexico|governor]] and other popularly elected officials, including the [[Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico|lieutenant governor]] (elected on the same ticket as the governor), [[Attorney General of New Mexico|attorney general]], [[Secretary of State of New Mexico|secretary of state]], [[New Mexico State Auditor|state auditor]], [[New Mexico State Treasurer|state treasurer]], and [[New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands|commissioner of public lands]]. New Mexico's governor is granted more authority than those of other states, with the power to appoint most high-ranking officials in the cabinet and other state agencies.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The legislative branch consists of the bicameral [[New Mexico Legislature]], comprising the 70-member [[New Mexico House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the 42-member [[New Mexico Senate|Senate]]. Members of the House are elected to two-year terms, while those of the Senate are elected every four years. New Mexican legislators are unique in the U.S. for being volunteers, receiving only a daily stipend while in session; this "citizen legislature" dates back to New Mexico's admission as a state, and is considered a source of civic pride.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Mexico has the nation's only unsalaried legislature.

The judiciary is headed by the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]], the state's highest court, which primarily [[appellate court|adjudicates appeals]] from lower courts or government agencies. It is made up of five judges popularly elected every eight years with overlapping terms. Below the state supreme court is the [[New Mexico Court of Appeals]], which has intermediate appellate jurisdiction statewide. New Mexico has 13 judicial districts with circuit courts of [[general jurisdiction]], as well as various municipal, [[State court magistrate judge|magistrate]], and probate courts of [[limited jurisdiction]].

New Mexico is organized into a number of local governments consisting of counties, municipalities, and special districts.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Mexico Government |url=http://www.newmexico.gov/government/ |website=www.newmexico.gov |access-date=January 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102050440/http://www.newmexico.gov/government/ |archive-date=January 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Both chambers of the [[New Mexico Legislature]] have Democratic majorities: 27 Democrats and 15 Republicans in the Senate, and 45 Democrats and 25 Republicans in the House of Representatives. Likewise, the state is represented in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] by Democrats [[Martin Heinrich]] and [[Ben Ray Luján]].

[[Al Gore]] narrowly carried the state in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] by 366 votes, and [[George W. Bush]] won in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] by less than 6,000 votes. The election of [[Barack Obama]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] marked the state's transition into [[Red states and blue states|a relatively reliably Democratic stronghold]] in a largely Republican region; Obama was also the first Democrat to win a majority of New Mexico votes since Johnson.<ref name="Weigel">{{Cite web |last=Weigel |first=David |date=October 8, 2012 |title=How Obama Won New Mexico Long Before Election Day |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/10/new-mexico-has-become-a-safe-democratic-state-because-of-a-growing-hispanic-population-native-americans-and-bad-republican-talking-points.html |access-date=2021-08-05 |website=Slate Magazine |language=en |archive-date=August 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210805222728/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/10/new-mexico-has-become-a-safe-democratic-state-because-of-a-growing-hispanic-population-native-americans-and-bad-republican-talking-points.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Obama won again in 2012, followed by Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Joe Biden in 2020.[[File:Party registration by New Mexico county.svg|thumb|Party registration by New Mexico county (February 2023):

Although state politics are decidedly Democratic leaning, New Mexico's political culture is relatively moderate and bipartisan by national standards. While registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 200,000, New Mexico voters have historically favored moderate to conservative candidates of both parties at the state and federal levels: According to [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research]], the largest political ideology among New Mexicans is [[political moderate]] at 36%, while 34% are [[conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], 23% are [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]], and 7% stated they did not know.<ref name="Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project 2022">{{cite web |date=June 13, 2022 |title=Public Life Landscape Study |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/ |access-date=December 26, 2022 |website=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project |archive-date=May 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220525045337/https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Likewise, New Mexico's demographics are atypical of most traditional liberal states with "political ideology [being] less important" than the profile or outreach efforts of the individual candidate.<ref name="Caldwell-2022">{{Cite news |title=New Mexico Democrats push their state as a model for winning in Southwest |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/23/new-mexico-democrats-latino/ |access-date=2022-12-23 |issn=0190-8286 |archive-date=December 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221223192451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/23/new-mexico-democrats-latino/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to their historically positive connections to the state's heritage, the [[Republican Party of New Mexico|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party of New Mexico|Democratic parties of New Mexico]] are each relatively robust, and New Mexico is considered a [[bellwether|bellwether state]].<ref name="The Advocate 20202">{{cite web |date=October 20, 2020 |title=New Mexico: Blue or Purple? |url=https://theacademyadvocate.com/5187/news/new-mexico-blue-or-purple/ |access-date=December 16, 2022 |website=The Advocate |archive-date=December 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221216195124/https://theacademyadvocate.com/5187/news/new-mexico-blue-or-purple/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Reichbach 20152">{{cite web |last=Reichbach |first=Matthew |date=June 11, 2015 |title=New Mexico a top historical 'bellwether' state for president |url=https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2015/06/11/new-mexico-a-top-historical-bellwether-state-for-president/ |access-date=December 16, 2022 |website=The NM Political Report |archive-date=December 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221216195124/https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2015/06/11/new-mexico-a-top-historical-bellwether-state-for-president/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Alberta 20202">{{cite web |last=Alberta |first=Tim |date=November 2, 2020 |title=This Place Has Picked Every President Since 1952.

Lujan Grisham succeeded two-term Republican governor [[Susana Martinez]] on January 1, 2019. [[Gary Johnson]] was governor from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, but in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] ran for president from the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. New Mexico's Second Congressional District is among the most competitive in the country: Republican Herrell narrowly lost to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Xochitl Torres Small]] in 2018 but retook her seat in 2020, subsequently losing to Democrat [[Gabe Vasquez]] in 2022.<ref name="Caldwell-2022" /> Recent election cycles within the past decade have seen moderate incumbents replaced by progressive Democrats in cities like Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces, with conservative Republicans being elected in rural areas. Democrats in the state are usually strongest in the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] area, parts of the [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] metro area (such as the southeast and central areas, including the affluent Nob Hill neighborhood and the vicinity of the [[University of New Mexico]]), Northern and West Central New Mexico, and most [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations, particularly the [[Navajo Nation]].<ref name="Weigel" /> Republicans have traditionally had their strongholds in the eastern and southern parts of the state, the [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]] area, [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]], and the newly developed areas in the northwest mesa. Albuquerque's Northeast Heights have historically leaned Republican but have become a key swing area for Democrats in recent election cycles.

A 2020 study ranked New Mexico as the 20th hardest state for citizens to vote, due mostly to the inaccessibility of polling stations among many isolated communities.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=J.

Research by the [[Center for American Women and Politics]] at [[Rutgers University]] found that two-thirds of all nonwhite women who have ever been elected governor in the U.S. are from New Mexico, including the current governor, Lujan Grisham. The state also accounts for nearly one-third of the women of color who have served in any statewide executive office, such as lieutenant governor and secretary of state, a distinction shared by only ten other states.<ref name="Thomson-DeVeaux-2020" /> New Mexico also has a relatively high percentage of state legislators who are women of color, which at 16% is the sixth highest in the nation.

{{See also|Government of Albuquerque, New Mexico|label 1=Government of Albuquerque}}Local government in New Mexico consists primarily of [[List of counties in New Mexico|counties]] and [[List of settlements in New Mexico|municipalities]].

New Mexican culture is a unique fusion of indigenous, Spanish, Hispanic, and American influences. The state bears some of the oldest evidence of human habitation, with thousands of years of indigenous heritage giving way to centuries of successive migration and settlement by Spanish, Mexican, and [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] colonists. The intermingling of these diverse groups is reflected in New Mexico's demographics, [[Toponymy|toponyms]], cuisine, dialect, and identity. The state's distinct culture and image are reflected in part by the fact that many Americans do not know it is part of the U.S.;<ref>{{Cite news|title=Is New Mexico a State?

Like other states in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]], New Mexico bears the legacy of the "[[American frontier|Old West]]" period of American westward expansion, characterized by [[cattle ranching]], [[cowboy]]s, [[American pioneer|pioneers]], the [[Santa Fe Trail]], and conflicts among and between settlers and Native Americans.<ref name="Beck-McNamee-2023b">{{Cite encyclopedia |entry=New Mexico |encyclopedia=Britannica |entry-url=https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico |access-date=2022-05-19 |language=en |archive-date=October 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231012085307/https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico |url-status=live }}</ref> The state's vast and diverse geography, sparse population, and [[List of ghost towns in New Mexico|abundance of ghost towns]] have contributed to its enduring frontier image and atmosphere.<ref name="Beck-McNamee-2023b" /> Many fictional works of the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]] are [[List of films shot in New Mexico|set or produced in New Mexico]].

The [[Duke City Gladiators]] of the [[Indoor Football League]] (IFL) plays their home games at [[Tingley Coliseum]] in Albuquerque; the city also hosts two soccer teams: [[New Mexico United]], which began playing in the [[United States soccer league system|second tier]] [[USL Championship]] in 2019, and the associated [[New Mexico United U23]], which plays in the fourth tier [[USL League Two]].

Collegiate athletics are the center of [[spectator sport]]s in New Mexico, namely the rivalry between various teams of the [[New Mexico Lobos|University of New Mexico Lobos]] and the [[New Mexico State Aggies]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|entry=New Mexico – The arts|entry-url=https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico|access-date=2021-08-11|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=October 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231012085307/https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Mexico|url-status=live}}</ref> The intense competition between the two teams is often referred to as the "[[Rio Grande Rivalry]]" or the "Battle of [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|I-25]]" (in reference to both campuses being located along that highway). [[NMSU]] also has a rivalry with the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] called "[[The Battle of I-10]]". The winner of the NMSU-UTEP football game receives the [[Silver Spade]] trophy.

Olympic gold medalist [[Tom Jager]], an advocate of controversial [[high-altitude training]] for swimming, has conducted training camps in Albuquerque at 5,312 feet (1,619{{spaces}}m) and [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] at 7,320 feet (2,231{{spaces}}m).<ref>(10-15-08) [http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/articles/swimtechnique/articles/200001-01st_art.asp "High Hopes: Altitude Training for Swimmers"], by Michael Scott, SwimmingWorldMagazine.com Magazine Archives. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703013341/http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/articles/swimtechnique/articles/200001-01st_art.asp|date=July 3, 2006}}.</ref>

New Mexico is a major hub for various [[shooting sports]], mainly concentrated in the [[NRA Whittington Center]] in Raton, which is largest and most comprehensive competitive shooting range and training facility in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/sports/othersports/03outdoors.html |title=The N.R.A.

=== Historic heritage ===
Owing to its millennia of habitation and over two centuries of Spanish colonial rule, New Mexico features a significant number of sites with historical and cultural significance. Forty-six locations across the state are listed by the [[U.S. National Historic Landmark|U.S. National Register of Historic Places]], the 18th highest of any state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Register Database and Research – National Register of Historic Places (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/database-research.htm|access-date=2021-08-02|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|archive-date=August 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828223402/https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/database-research.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

New Mexico has nine of the country's 84 national monuments, which are sites federally protected by presidential proclamation; this is the second-highest number after Arizona.<ref name="Mazurek-2021" /> The monuments include some of the earliest to have been created: [[El Morro National Monument|El Morro]] and [[Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument|Gila Cliff Dwellings]], proclaimed in 1906 and 1907, respectively; both preserve the state's ancient indigenous heritage.<ref name="Mazurek-2021" />

New Mexico is one of 20 states with a [[List of World Heritage Sites in the United States|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], and among only eight with more than one. Excluding sites shared between states, New Mexico has the most World Heritage Sites in the country, with three exclusively within its territory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chaco Culture|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/353/|access-date=2021-08-02|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|archive-date=July 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210727154835/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/353|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Taos Pueblo|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/492/|access-date=2021-08-02|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|archive-date=August 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210814035724/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/492/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Carlsbad Caverns National Park|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/721/|access-date=2021-08-02|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|archive-date=August 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813182043/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/721/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since 1970, ''[[New Mexico Magazine]]'' has had a standing feature, ''One of Our 50 Is Missing {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230621042851/https://www.newmexicomagazine.org/blog/post/one-of-our-50-is-missing-may-2023/ |date=June 21, 2023 }},'' which relates often humorous anecdotes about instances in which people elsewhere do not realize New Mexico is a state, confuse it with the nation of Mexico, or otherwise mistake it as being a foreign country. The state's license plates say "New Mexico USA", so as to avoid confusion with Mexico, which it borders to the southwest. New Mexico is the only state that specifies "USA" on its license plates.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kurtz |first=Todd |date=June 21, 2017 |title=Loving the Land of Enchantment: License Plates |url=https://www.koat.com/article/loving-the-land-of-enchantment-license-plates/10200618 |access-date=2023-06-27 |website=KOAT |language=en |archive-date=June 27, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230627145406/https://www.koat.com/article/loving-the-land-of-enchantment-license-plates/10200618 |url-status=live }}</ref>
