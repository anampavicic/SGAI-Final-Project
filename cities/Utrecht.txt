Utrecht's ancient city centre features many buildings and structures, several dating as far back as the [[High Middle Ages]]. It has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. In 1579, the [[Union of Utrecht]] was signed in the city to lay the foundations for the [[Dutch Republic]]. Utrecht was the most important city in the Netherlands until the [[Dutch Golden Age]], when it was surpassed by [[Amsterdam]] as the country's cultural centre and most populous city.

Utrecht is home to [[Utrecht University]], the largest university in the Netherlands, as well as several other institutions of higher education. Due to its central position within the country, it is an important hub for both [[rail transport|rail]] and [[road transport]]; it has the busiest railway station in the Netherlands, [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal]]. It has the second-highest number of cultural events in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam.<ref name="Umon">{{cite web |author=Gemeente Utrecht |title=Utrecht Monitor 2007 |url=http://www.utrecht.nl/images/Secretarie/Bestuursinformatie/Publicaties2007/UM2007/UtrechtMonitor2007.pdf |access-date=6 January 2008 |language=nl |archive-date=6 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206065523/http://www.utrecht.nl/images/Secretarie/Bestuursinformatie/Publicaties2007/UM2007/UtrechtMonitor2007.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012, [[Lonely Planet]] included Utrecht in the top 10 of the world's unsung places.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blasi |first=Abigail |title=10 of the world's unsung places |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/10-of-the-worlds-unsung-places/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d277e7b8 |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=14 May 2012 |access-date=6 August 2017 |archive-date=7 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807023240/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/10-of-the-worlds-unsung-places/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d277e7b8 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

===Origins (before 650 CE)===
[[File:Traiectum - Wttecht - Utrecht (Atlas van Loon).jpg|thumb|left|[[Willem Blaeu]]'s 1652 map of Utrecht]]
Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the [[Stone Age]] (app. 2200 [[BCE]]) and settling in the [[Bronze Age]] (app. 1800–800&nbsp;BCE),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=163711 |title=Gemeente Utrecht, Geschiedenis Utrecht voor 1528 |access-date=8 September 2008 |archive-date=16 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016132507/http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=163711 |url-status=live }}</ref> the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[fortification]] (''[[castellum]]''), probably built in around 50 [[Current Era|CE]]. A series of such fortresses were built after the [[Roman emperor]] [[Claudius]] decided the empire should not expand further north. To consolidate the border, the [[Limes Germanicus]] defense line was constructed<ref name="20eUtrecht">{{cite book |last1=de Bruin |first1=R.E. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=T.J. |last3=Pietersma |first3=A. |author-link3=Albert Pietersma |title=Twintig eeuwen Utrecht, korte geschiedenis van de stad |publisher=SPOU & Het Utrechts Archief |location=Utrecht |year=1999 |language=nl |isbn=90-5479-040-7}}</ref> along the main branch of the river [[Rhine]], which at that time traversed a more northern route (now known as the [[Kromme Rijn]]) compared to today's Rhine flow. These fortresses were designed to house a [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort, settlements grew that housed [[artisan]]s, traders and soldiers' wives and children.

In Roman times, the name of the Utrecht fortress was simply ''[[Traiectum (Utrecht)|Traiectum]]'', denoting its location at a possible Rhine crossing. Traiectum became Dutch Trecht; with the U from [[Old Dutch]] "uut" (downriver) added to distinguish U-trecht from [[Maastricht|Maas-tricht]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Het Utrechts Archief |title=Het ontstaan van de stad Utrecht (tot 100) |url=http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/werkstukken/onderwerpen/ontstaan-utrecht |language=nl |access-date=21 October 2009 |archive-date=2 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502015136/http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/werkstukken/onderwerpen/ontstaan-utrecht |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=van der Sijs |first=Nicoline |title=Chronologisch woordenboek.

From the middle of the 3rd century, [[Germanic Tribes|Germanic tribes]] regularly invaded the Roman territories. After around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border, and Utrecht was abandoned.<ref name="20eUtrecht"/> Little is known about the period from 270 to 650. Utrecht is first spoken of again several centuries after the Romans left. Under the influence of the growing realms of the [[Franks]], during [[Dagobert I]]'s reign in the 7th century, a church was built within the walls of the Roman fortress.<ref name="20eUtrecht"/> In ongoing border conflicts with the [[Frisians]], this first church was destroyed.

===Centre of Christianity in the Netherlands (650–1579)===
[[File:Dom in Utrecht - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Dom Tower of Utrecht|Dom Tower]] seen from the city centre. The remaining section of the [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht|Cathedral of Saint Martin]] is not connected to the tower since the collapse of the [[nave]] in 1674 due to a storm.]]{{Main articles|Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht}}
By the mid-7th century, British, English and Irish [[missionaries]] set out to convert the [[Frisians]]. [[Pope Sergius I]] appointed their leader, Saint [[Willibrordus]], as bishop of the Frisians. The tenure of Willibrordus is generally considered to be the beginning of the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Bishopric of Utrecht]].<ref name="20eUtrecht"/> In 723, the Frankish leader [[Charles Martel]] bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The archbishops of Utrecht were based at the uneasy northern border of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. In addition, the city of Utrecht had competition from the nearby trading centre [[Dorestad]].<ref name="20eUtrecht"/> After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite book |last=van der Tuuk |first=Luit |editor-last=van der Eerden |editor-first=Ria |display-editors=etal |chapter=Denen in Dorestad |title=Jaarboek Oud Utrecht 2005 |publisher=SPOU |location=Utrecht |year=2005 |pages=5–40 |language=nl |isbn=90-71108-24-4}}</ref> The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born [[Pope Adrian VI|Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens]] as [[pope]] in 1522 (the last non-Italian pope before [[John Paul II]]).

====Prince-bishops====
{{main|Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)}}
When the Frankish rulers established the system of [[feudalism]], the [[Bishop]]s of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as [[prince-bishop]]s.<ref name="20eUtrecht"/> The territory of the bishopric not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower [[Sticht]]'), but also extended to the northeast. The feudal conflict of the [[Middle Ages]] heavily affected Utrecht. The prince-bishopric was involved in almost continuous conflicts with the Counts of [[County of Holland|Holland]] and the Dukes of [[Guelders]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Janssen |first=H.P.H. |title=Geschiedenis van de Middeleeuwen |publisher=Aula |location=Utrecht |edition=12th |year=2002 |pages=289–296 |language=nl |isbn=90-274-5377-2}}</ref> The [[Veluwe]] region was seized by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of [[Overijssel]] remained as the Oversticht.

====Religious buildings====
Several churches and monasteries were built inside, or close to, the city of Utrecht. The most dominant of these was the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht|Cathedral of Saint Martin]], inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building was begun in 1254 after an earlier [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] construction had been badly damaged by fire. The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[transept]] were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious [[Dom Tower of Utrecht|Dom tower]].<ref name="20eUtrecht"/> The last part to be constructed was the central [[nave]], from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned [[flying buttress]]es could be finished.<ref name="20eUtrecht"/>
Besides the cathedral there were four [[collegiate church]]es in Utrecht: [[St. Salvator's Church]] (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stöver |first=R.J. |title=De Salvator- of Oudmunsterkerk te Utrecht, Stichtingsmonument van het bisdom Utrecht |language=nl |year=1997 |location=Utrecht}}</ref> Saint [[John the Baptist|John]] (Janskerk), originating in 1040;<ref>{{cite web |title=Janskerk Informatie |url=http://www.janskerkutrecht.nl/ |access-date=6 January 2008 |archive-date=30 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230083733/http://www.janskerkutrecht.nl/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Pieterskerk, Utrecht|Saint Peter]], building started in 1039<ref>{{cite web |title=Sint Pieterskerk Utrecht |url=http://www.planetware.com/utrecht/st-pieterskerk-nl-ut-piet.htm |access-date=5 January 2008 |archive-date=3 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303170005/http://www.planetware.com/utrecht/st-pieterskerk-nl-ut-piet.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]]'s church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives).<ref>{{cite book |last=Haverkate |first=H.M. |title=Een kerk van papier.

Besides these churches, the city housed [[St. Paul's Abbey, Utrecht|St. Paul's Abbey]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Broer |first=C.J.C. |title=Uniek in de stad.

Besides these buildings which belonged to the bishopric, an additional four [[parish church]]es were constructed in the city: the [[Jacobikerk]] ([[James, son of Zebedee|dedicated to Saint James]]), founded in the 11th century, with the current Gothic church dating back to the 14th century;<ref>{{cite web |title=Jacobikerk |url=http://www.jacobikerk.nl/ |access-date=6 January 2008 |archive-date=9 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109205733/http://www.jacobikerk.nl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> the Buurkerk (Neighbourhood-church) of the 11th-century parish in the centre of the city; Nicolaichurch (dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]]), from the 12th century,<ref>{{cite web |title=Nicolaikerk |url=http://www.nicolaikerk.nl/ |access-date=6 January 2008 |archive-date=24 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224223244/http://www.nicolaikerk.nl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and the 13th-century Geertekerk (dedicated to Saint [[Gertrude of Nivelles]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Geertekerk – Remonstrantse Gemeente Utrecht |url=http://www.geertekerk.nl/ |access-date=6 January 2008 |archive-date=5 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205235942/http://www.geertekerk.nl/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

====City of Utrecht====
Its location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town was granted [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] by [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] at Utrecht on 2 June 1122. When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed which still flowed through the heart of the town became ever more [[canal]]ized; and the wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system.<ref>{{cite web |title=De Utrechtse (Werven |language=nl |publisher=Gemeente Utrecht |url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=168424 |access-date=27 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016132529/http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=168424 |archive-date=16 October 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On the wharfs, storage facilities (''werfkelders'') were built, on top of which the main street, including houses, was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure.<ref group=nb>Almost all other canal cities in The Netherlands (such as Amsterdam and Delft) have the water in canals bordering directly to the road surface</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Historic wharf photos from the Utrecht City Archive |publisher=Utrecht City Archive |url=http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/atlantis_treffers.asp?trefwoord=werven |access-date=27 January 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy.<ref name="20eUtrecht"/> The bishop, for example dammed the [[Kromme Rijn]] at [[Wijk bij Duurstede]] to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the [[Hollandse IJssel]] at [[IJsselstein]].

====The end of independence====
In 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht—which included the city of Utrecht—to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Charles V combined the [[Seventeen Provinces]] (the current [[Benelux]] and the northern parts of France) as a personal union. This ended the prince-bishopric of Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the [[lordship of Utrecht]], with the religious power remaining with the bishop, although Charles V had gained the right to appoint new bishops. In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious centre of the Northern [[ecclesiastical province]] in the Seventeen Provinces.

The transition from independence to a relatively minor part of a larger union was not easily accepted. To quell uprisings, Charles V struggled to exert his power over the city's citizens who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to cede this to their new lord. The heavily fortified castle [[Vredenburg (castle)|Vredenburg]] was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city. The castle would last less than 50&nbsp;years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the [[Dutch Revolt]].

===Republic of the Netherlands (1579–1806)===
[[File:Lambert de Hondt (II) - The Surrender of Utrecht.jpg|thumb|[[Lambert de Hondt (II)]]: the Surrender of Utrecht on 30 June 1672 to the French king [[Louis XIV]], 1672, [[Centraal Museum|Centraal Museum Utrecht]]]]

In 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the [[Union of Utrecht]] treaty (Dutch: Unie van Utrecht), in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the [[Dutch Republic]]. In 1580, the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The [[stadtholder]]s disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic, shifting the power towards its dominant province [[Holland]]. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht. Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic being about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more so among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wayne Franits |title=Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting |page=65 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-300-10237-2}}</ref>

The fortified city temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the [[Rampjaar|Disaster Year]], Dutch: Rampjaar). The French invasion was stopped just west of Utrecht at the [[Hollandic Water Line#Old Hollandic Waterline|Old Hollandic Waterline]]. In 1674, only two years after the French left, the centre of Utrecht was struck by a [[tornado]]. The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the cathedral of St Martin church's central section which collapsed, creating the current Dom square between the tower and choir. In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] settled the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Beginning in 1723, Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman [[Old Catholic Church]]es in the world.

===Modern history (1815–present)===

[[File:Utrecht-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|left|thumb|Contemporary map of Utrecht]]
In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the [[Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie]] were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an [[English garden|English style landscape park]] that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the [[Train routes in the Netherlands|Dutch railway network]]. With the [[Industrial Revolution]] finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond its medieval centre. When the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] in 1853, Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward, neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, [[Wittevrouwen]], Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle-class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and [[Oog in Al]], were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several [[Jugendstil]] houses and office buildings were built, followed by [[Gerrit Rietveld|Rietveld]] who built the [[Rietveld Schröder House]] (1924), and [[Willem Marinus Dudok|Dudok]]'s construction of the city theatre (1941).

[[File:Oudegracht 158.JPG|thumb|The [[Winkel van Sinkel]], the first department store in The Netherlands.]]
During [[World War II]], Utrecht was held by German forces until the general German surrender of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945. [[British army|British]] and [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] troops that had surrounded the city entered it after that surrender, on 7 May 1945. Following the end of World War II, the city grew considerably when new neighbourhoods such as [[Overvecht]], [[Kanaleneiland]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Hoograven|nl}} and [[Lunetten]] were built. Around 2000, the [[Leidsche Rijn]] housing area was developed as an extension of the city to the west.{{Cn|date=April 2023}}

The area surrounding [[Utrecht Centraal railway station]] and the station itself were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] style. This development led to the construction of the shopping mall {{Interlanguage link multi|Hoog Catharijne|nl}}, the music centre Vredenburg ([[Herman Hertzberger|Hertzberger]], 1979), and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway ([[Catharijnesingel|Catherijnebaan]]). Protest against further modernisation of the city centre followed even before the last buildings were finalised. In the early 21st century, the whole area is undergoing change again. The redeveloped music centre TivoliVredenburg opened in 2014 with the original Vredenburg and Tivoli concert and rock and jazz halls brought together in a single building.  {{Clear}}

=== Religion ===
Utrecht has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. Currently it is the see of the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]], the most senior Dutch Roman Catholic leader.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aartsbisdom Utrecht |url=http://www.aartsbisdom.nl/ |language=nl |access-date=10 December 2007 |archive-date=30 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130092121/https://www.aartsbisdom.nl/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Katholiek Nederland |url=http://www.katholieknederland.nl/ |language=nl |access-date=10 December 2007 |archive-date=4 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004021841/http://www.katholieknederland.nl/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> His [[ecclesiastical province]] covers the whole kingdom.

Utrecht is also the see of the archbishop of the [[Old Catholic Church]], titular head of the [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Union of Utrecht]], and the location of the offices of the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the main Dutch Protestant church.

As of 2013, the largest religion is Christianity with 28% of the population being Christian, followed by Islam with 9.9% in 2016 and Hinduism with 0.8%.

===Population centres and agglomeration===
The city of Utrecht is subdivided into 10 city quarters, all of which have their own neighbourhood council and service centre for civil affairs.

# Leidsche Rijn

# Overvecht 
# Zuid

Utrecht is the centre of a densely populated area, a fact which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary. The smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built-up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes [[Nieuwegein]], [[IJsselstein]] and [[Maarssen]]. It is sometimes argued that the close by municipalities [[De Bilt]], [[Zeist]], [[Houten]], [[Vianen]], [[Driebergen-Rijsenburg]] ([[Utrechtse Heuvelrug]]), and [[Bunnik]] should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration, bringing the total to 640,000 inhabitants. The larger region, including slightly more remote cities such as [[Woerden]] and [[Amersfoort]], counts up to 820,000 inhabitants.<ref name="CBS statline 2007">{{cite web |author=CBS Statline |title=Gemiddelde bevolking per regio naar leeftijd en geslacht / Gebieden in Nederland 2007 |year=2007 |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/start.asp?KEYWORDS=agglomeratie+utrecht&BOOL=0&LA=NL&DM=SLNL&lp=Search/SResults |access-date=5 January 2008}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The former Utrecht Main Post Office, built in 1924, is still in the city centre at Neude square, but is now serving as library, see also [[Utrecht Post Office]].

Another landmark is the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city. The [[Oudegracht]] is a curved canal, partly following the ancient main branch of the [[Rhine]]. It is lined with the unique wharf-basement structures that create a two-level street along the canals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=168424 |title=Cultuurhistorie en Monumenten |publisher=Utrecht.nl |date=4 December 1993 |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608230327/http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=168424 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The inner city has largely retained its medieval structure,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=90241 |title=Wijksite Binnenstad |publisher=Utrecht.nl |date=30 March 2011 |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608232007/http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=90241 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/Utrecht/Utrecht.htm |publisher=Map21ltd.com |access-date=13 April 2011 |title=Utrecht |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807220327/http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/Utrecht/Utrecht.htm |archive-date=7 August 2003 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 1970s part of the moat was converted into a motorway.

Because of the role of Utrecht as a fortified city, construction outside the medieval centre and its city walls was restricted until the 19th century. Surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late-19th- and early-20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out.<ref>Historische Atlas van de stad Utrecht. {{ISBN|90-8506-189-X}}</ref> The eastern part of Utrecht remains fairly open. The [[Dutch Water Line]], moved east of the city in the early 19th century, required open lines of fire, thus prohibiting all permanent constructions until the middle of the 20th century on the east side of the city.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Wandelplatform-LAW |title=Waterliniepad |language=nl |edition=1st |year=2004 |isbn=90-71068-61-7}}</ref>

Due to the past importance of Utrecht as a religious centre, several monumental churches were erected, many of which have survived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kerkenkijken.nl/ |title=Kerken Kijken Utrecht &#124; Home |publisher=Kerkenkijken.nl |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724113700/http://www.kerkenkijken.nl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Most prominent is the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht|Dom Church]]. Other notable churches include the romanesque [[Pieterskerk, Utrecht|St Peter's]] and St John's churches; the gothic churches of St James and St Nicholas; and the Buurkerk, now converted into a [[Museum Speelklok|museum for automatically playing musical instruments]].

==Transport==
===Public transport===
Because of its central location, Utrecht is well connected to the rest of the Netherlands and has a well-developed public transport network.

====Heavy rail====
[[File:2015-08 utrecht cs 02.JPG|thumb|Utrecht Centraal railway station]]
[[Utrecht Centraal]] is the main railway station of Utrecht and is the largest in the country. There are regular intercity services to all major Dutch cities, including direct services to [[Schiphol railway station|Schiphol Airport]]. Utrecht Centraal is a station on the [[Rail transport in the Netherlands#Night service|night service]], providing an all-night service to (among others) Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, seven days a week. International [[InterCityExpress]] (ICE) services to Germany through [[Arnhem]] call at Utrecht Centraal. Regular local trains to all areas surrounding Utrecht also depart from Utrecht Centraal; and service several smaller stations: [[Utrecht Lunetten railway station|Utrecht Lunetten]]; [[Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn railway station|Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn]]; [[Utrecht Overvecht railway station|Utrecht Overvecht]]; [[Utrecht Leidsche Rijn railway station|Utrecht Leidsche Rijn]]; [[Utrecht Terwijde railway station|Utrecht Terwijde]]; [[Utrecht Zuilen railway station|Utrecht Zuilen]] and [[Vleuten railway station|Vleuten]]. A former station [[Utrecht Maliebaan railway station|Utrecht Maliebaan]] closed in 1939 and has since been converted into the [[Dutch Railway Museum]].

Utrecht is the location of the headquarters of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] (English: ''Dutch Railways''), the largest rail operator in the Netherlands, and [[ProRail]], the state-owned company responsible for the construction and maintenance of the country's rail infrastructure.

====Light rail====
The [[Utrecht sneltram]] is a [[light rail]] scheme running southwards from Utrecht Centraal to the suburbs of [[IJsselstein]], [[Kanaleneiland]], Lombok and [[Nieuwegein]]. The sneltram began operations in 1983 and is currently operated by the private transport company [[Qbuzz]]. On 16 December 2019 the new tram line to the [[Uithof]] started operating, creating a direct [[mass transit]] connection from the [[central station]] to the main [[Utrecht university]] campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/qbuzz-wins-utrecht-sneltram-concession.html |access-date=31 October 2010 |title=Railway Gazette: Qbuzz wins Utrecht sneltram concession |archive-date=29 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029163732/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/qbuzz-wins-utrecht-sneltram-concession.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Bus transport====
The main local and regional bus station of Utrecht is located adjacent to Utrecht Centraal railway station, at the East and West entrances. Due to large-scale renovation and construction works at the railway station, the station's bus stops are changing frequently. As a general rule, westbound buses depart from the bus station on the west entrance, other buses from the east side station. Local [[bus]]es in Utrecht are operated by [[Qbuzz]]; its services include a high-frequency service to the [[Uithof]] university district. The local bus fleet is one of Europe's cleanest, using only buses compliant with the [[European emission standards#Emission standards for trucks and buses|Euro-VI standard]] as well as electric buses for inner-city transport. Regional buses from the city are operated by [[Arriva]] and [[Connexxion]].

The Utrecht Centraal railway station is also served by the pan-European services of [[Eurolines]]. Furthermore, it acts as departure and arrival place of many coach companies serving holiday resorts in Spain and France—and during winter in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].

===Cycling===
Like most Dutch cities, Utrecht has an extensive network of [[Bicycle path|cycle paths]], making cycling safe and popular. 33% of journeys within the city are by bicycle, more than any other mode of transport.<ref>{{cite web |title=Microsoft Word - Utrecht city document.doc |url=http://blog.zeit.de/gruenegeschaefte/files/2010/05/2008-06-11-utrecht_city_document-ditewig.pdf |access-date=23 June 2014 |archive-date=23 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223173828/http://blog.zeit.de/gruenegeschaefte/files/2010/05/2008-06-11-utrecht_city_document-ditewig.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> (Cars, for example, account for 30% of trips). Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few gears. There are also bucket bikes for carrying cargo such as groceries or small children. Thanks in part to the access provided by bicycles, 100% of the population lives in a [[15-minute city]] and more than 90% can get to the major destination types within 10 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A composite X-minute city cycling accessibility metric and its role in assessing spatial and socioeconomic inequalities – A case study in Utrecht, the Netherlands |journal=Journal of Urban Mobility |date=December 2023 |doi=10.1016/j.urbmob.2022.100043 |last1=Knap |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Ulak |first2=Mehmet Baran |last3=Geurs |first3=Karst T. |last4=Mulders |first4=Alex |last5=Van Der Drift |first5=Sander |volume=3 |page=100043 |s2cid=255256096 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In 2014, the city council decided to build the world's largest [[bicycle parking station]], near the [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Central Railway Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/04/utrecht_to_build_worlds_bigges |title=Utrecht to build world's biggest bike park – for 12,500 bikes – DutchNews.nl |work=DutchNews.nl |date=27 April 2014 |access-date=29 March 2015 |archive-date=29 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329220826/http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/04/utrecht_to_build_worlds_bigges |url-status=live }}</ref> This three-floor construction cost over €30&nbsp;million and can hold 12,500 bicycles.

===Road transport===
Utrecht is well-connected to the Dutch road network. Two of the most important major roads serve the city of Utrecht: the [[A12 motorway (Netherlands)|A12]] and [[A2 motorway (Netherlands)|A2]] motorways connect [[Amsterdam]], [[Arnhem]], [[The Hague]] and [[Maastricht]], as well as Belgium and Germany. Other major motorways in the area are the [[Almere]]–[[Breda]] [[A27 motorway (Netherlands)|A27]] and the Utrecht–[[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] [[A28 motorway (Netherlands)|A28]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Autosnelwegen.nl |url=http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/ |publisher=Autosnelwegen.nl |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-date=29 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329095027/http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht, causing elevated levels of [[air pollutant]]s. This has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city's air quality.

===Shipping===
Utrecht has an industrial port located on the [[Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Michael |last=Clarke |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-21914/Amsterdam-Rhine-Canal |title=Amsterdam-Rhine Canal (canal, the Netherlands) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-date=30 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230141826/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-21914/Amsterdam-Rhine-Canal |url-status=live }}</ref> The container terminal has a capacity of 80,000 containers a year.

==Economy==
[[File:Utrecht de inktpot september 2003.jpg|thumb|'{{Interlanguage link multi|De Inktpot|nl}}' ("The Inkpot") with fake UFO]]

Production industry constitutes a small part of the economy of Utrecht. The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city. It is the centre of the Dutch railway network and the location of the head office of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]]. [[ProRail]] is headquartered in ''{{Interlanguage link multi|De Inktpot|nl}}'' (The Inkwell), the largest brick building in the Netherlands<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usine-utrecht.nl/inktpot-prorail-ns-hoofdkantoor/ |title=De administratiegebouwen van de spoorwegen te Utrecht |access-date=10 April 2020 |language=nl |date=15 February 2016 |archive-date=23 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223144903/http://www.usine-utrecht.nl/inktpot-prorail-ns-hoofdkantoor/ |url-status=live }}</ref> (the "UFO" featured on its façade stems from an art program in 2000).
