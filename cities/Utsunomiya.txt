==History==
Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that the area of Utsunomiya has been continuously settled since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period onwards, and numerous [[kofun|burial mounds]] from the [[Kofun period]] are found within its borders. The {{nihongo|Utsunomiya Futarasan Shrine|宇都宮二荒山神社||}}, which is the [[Ichinomiya]] of [[Shimotsuke Province]] claims to have been founded in 353 AD. The town of Utsunomiya developed around this shrine, and the area was under the control of the Utsunomiya clan, an offshoot of the [[Fujiwara clan]] from the [[Heian period|Heian]] through [[Sengoku period]]s, and was destroyed by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].

During the [[Edo period]], the Utsunomiya area was ruled by a succession of ''[[daimyō]]'' clans under [[Utsunomiya Domain]], and prospered from its location at the junction of the [[Nikkō Kaidō]] and the [[Ōshū Kaidō]]. During the [[Bakumatsu period]] [[Boshin War]], the [[Battle of Utsunomiya Castle]] was a major conflict in the northern Kantō area. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], Utsunomiya was briefly (1871–1873) part of Utsunomiya Prefecture, which was then merged into the new Tochigi Prefecture, and became the capital of the prefecture in 1884. Utsunomiya became an important garrison for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

With the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the town of Utsunomiya was officially established. At the end of 1889, Utsunomiya had a population of 30,698 making it the third most populous municipality in the Kantō area, after Tokyo and [[Yokohama]].  Utsunomiya was raised to city status on April 1, 1896.  On July 12, 1945, much of Utsunomiya and the surrounding areas were destroyed in the American [[Bombing of Utsunomiya during World War II]].

The city limits were expanded from 1951 to 1955 by annexing neighboring Suzumenomiya town and Hiraishi, Yokokawa, Mizuhono, Kunimoto, Shiroyama, Tomiya, Toyosato, and Sugatagawa villages and the part of Shinoi village from [[Kawachi District, Tochigi|Kawachi District]] and Kiyohara village from [[Haga District, Tochigi|Haga District]].  In 1996, Utsunomiya was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] with increased autonomy.  On March 31, 2007, Utsunomiya absorbed the towns of [[Kamikawachi, Tochigi|Kamikawachi]] and [[Kawachi, Tochigi|Kawachi]] (both from Kawachi District), pushing the population of Utsunomiya City over 500,000.

==Government==
Utsunomiya has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 45 members. Utsunomiya, together with the town of Kamikawa collectively contributes 13 members to the Tochigi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Tochigi 1st district]] and [[Tochigi 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

===Utsunomiya's famous dumplings===

====History of Gyoza====
Following the Second World War, Japanese soldiers who returned from Manchuria brought home to Utsunomiya gyoza recipes that originated from China. Soon after, the soldiers began to open dumpling (gyoza) restaurants around Utsunomiya. After the Utsunomiya city officials started to realize the popularity of gyoza in 1990, the Utsunomiya Gyoza Association was created. The creation of this association only made gyoza's popularity grow in the city. Utsunomiya gyoza is famous country-wide, so it attracts many tourists, as well as brings in a significant amount of revenue into the city.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Szymanski|first1=Andrew|title=Welcome to Utsunomiya -- gyoza town|url=http://travel.cnn.com/tokyo/eat/utsunomiya-gyoza-town-200431/|website=CNN Travel|access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref>

====Popularity of Gyoza====
The city has 30 restaurants that specialize in serving gyoza. Utsunomiya is allegedly the highest consumer city of gyoza in Japan. There is also a {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} statue in the shape of the gyoza outside of Utsunomiya's JR station.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gilhooly|first1=Rob|title=Utsunomiya brings 'gyoza' lovers into fold|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2001/03/06/general/utsunomiya-brings-gyoza-lovers-into-fold/#.WK-MtVUrLIV|website=The Japan Times|access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref>

====The Gyoza Festival====
Utsunomiya's annual Gyoza Dumplings Festival occurs at the Castle Ruins Park. Visitors are able to taste different types of gyozas served by various gyoza-making restaurants. Festival attendees can also watch various bands and comedians near the festival grounds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Osumi|first1=Magdalena|title=Good time to visit the dumpling capital of Japan|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/10/31/events/events-outside-tokyo/good-time-to-visit-the-dumpling-capital-of-japan/#.WK-NSVUrLIW|website=The Japan Times|access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref>
