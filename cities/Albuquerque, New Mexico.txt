[[Petroglyphs]] carved into basalt in the western part of the city bear testimony to a Native American presence in the area dating back many centuries.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 March 2021 |title=What are Petroglyphs |url=https://www.nps.gov/petr/learn/historyculture/what.htm |access-date=19 June 2024 |website=National Park Service}}</ref> These are preserved in the [[Petroglyph National Monument]].

The [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] and [[Keres languages|Keresan]] peoples had lived along the Rio Grande for centuries before European colonists arrived in the area that developed as Albuquerque. By the 1500s, there were around 20 [[Tiwa Puebloans|Tiwa]] pueblos along a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of river from present-day [[Algodones, New Mexico|Algodones]] to the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande tributary)|Rio Puerco]] confluence south of [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]].

It was then chosen as the site of the [[San Agustín de la Isleta Mission]], a [[Catholic mission]].

The historic [[Navajo]], [[Apache]], and [[Comanche]] peoples were likely to have set camps in the Albuquerque area, as there is evidence of trade and cultural exchange among the different Native American groups going back centuries before European arrival.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seymour|first1=Deni|title=From the Land of Ever Winter to the American Southwest|date=2012|publisher=University of Utah Press}}</ref>

Albuquerque developed primarily for farming and sheep herds. It was a strategically located trading and military outpost along the [[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro|Camino Real]]. It served other [[Tiwa Puebloans|Tiquex]] and [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]] towns settled in the area, such as [[Barelas]], [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]], [[Isleta Pueblo]], [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos]], and [[Sandia Pueblo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmallstar.com/albuquerque_visitor_information.html |title=History |publisher=Nmallstar.com |access-date=February 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325201851/http://www.nmallstar.com/albuquerque_visitor_information.html#Albuquerques |archive-date=March 25, 2012 }}</ref>

After gaining independence in 1821, Mexico established a military presence here. The town of Alburquerque was built in the traditional Spanish villa pattern: a central [[plaza]] surrounded by government buildings, homes, and a church. This central plaza area has been preserved and is open to the public as a cultural area and center of commerce. It is referred to as "[[Old Town Albuquerque]]" or simply "Old Town". Historically it was sometimes referred to as "La Placita" (''Little Plaza'' in Spanish). On the north side of Old Town Plaza is [[San Felipe de Neri Church]]. Built in 1793, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the city.<ref>{{cite web

After the New Mexico Territory became a part of the United States in the mid-19th century, a federal garrison and quartermaster depot, the Post of Albuquerque, were established here, operating from 1846 to 1867. In ''Beyond the Mississippi'' (1867), [[Albert D. Richardson]], traveling to California via coach, passed through Albuquerque in late October 1859—its population was 3,000 at the time—and described it as "one of the richest and pleasantest towns, with a Spanish cathedral and other buildings more than two hundred years old."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=Albert D.|title=Beyond the Mississippi: From the Great River to the Great Ocean|publisher=American Publishing Co.|year=1867|location=Hartford, Conn.|pages=249}}</ref>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Albuquerque was occupied for a month in February 1862 by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] troops under General [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]]. He soon afterward advanced with his main body into northern New Mexico.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} During his retreat from [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops into [[Texas]], he made a stand on April 8, 1862, and fought the [[Battle of Albuquerque]] against a detachment of Union soldiers commanded by Colonel [[Edward Canby|Edward R. S. Canby]]. This daylong engagement at long range led to few casualties. The residents of Albuquerque aided the Republican Union to rid the city of the occupying Confederate troops.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

When the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] arrived in 1880, it bypassed the Plaza, locating the passenger depot and railyards about <span style="white-space:nowrap">2&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(3&nbsp;km)</span> east in what quickly became known as New Albuquerque or New Town. The railway company built a hospital for its workers that was later used as a juvenile psychiatric facility.

Many Anglo merchants, mountain men, and settlers slowly filtered into Albuquerque, creating a major mercantile commercial center in [[Downtown Albuquerque]]. From this commercial center on July 4, 1882, [[Park Van Tassel]] became the first to fly a balloon in Albuquerque with a landing at Old Town.<ref name="Fogel">{{Cite book| last = Fogel | first = Gary | title = Sky Rider: Park Van Tassel and the Rise of Ballooning in the West | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | location = Albuquerque | year = 2021 | isbn = 978-0-8263-6282-7 }}</ref> This was the first balloon flight in the New Mexico Territory.

Due to a rising rate of violent crime, gunman [[Milton J. Yarberry|Milt Yarberry]] was appointed the town's first marshal that year. New Albuquerque was incorporated as a town in 1885, with Henry N. Jaffa its first mayor.

Old Town remained a separate community until the 1920s, when it was absorbed by Albuquerque. [[Old Albuquerque High School]], the city's first public high school, was established in 1879.

Jaffa, who was also the city's first mayor, is the oldest continuing Jewish organization in the city.<ref name="congregationalbert.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.congregationalbert.org/|title=Home|work=congregationalbert.org|access-date=June 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612085809/http://www.congregationalbert.org/|archive-date=June 12, 2015}}</ref>

By 1900, Albuquerque boasted a population of 8,000 and all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway connecting Old Town, New Town, and the recently established University of New Mexico campus on the East Mesa.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}  In 1902, the [[Alvarado Hotel]] was built adjacent to the new passenger depot, and it remained a famous symbol of the city for decades.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1969 |title=The Alvarado Hotel |url=https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1658&context=nma |work=New Mexico Architect |pages=20–23 |via=University of New Mexico}}</ref> Outdated, it was razed in 1970 and the site was converted to a parking lot.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1970 |title=The Alvarado Hotel |url=https://wheelsmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Alvarado-Hotel.pdf |access-date=19 June 2024 |work=New Mexico Architect |pages=16–19 |via=Wheels Museum}}</ref>

In 2002, the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] was built on the site in a style resembling the old landmark. The large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city's transit department. It also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, [[Amtrak]] passenger trains, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] commuter rail line.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In the early days of transcontinental air service, Albuquerque was an important stop on many transcontinental air routes, earning it the nickname "Crossroads of the Southwest".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kirtland.baseguide.net/history.html|title=Kirtland AFB Guide/Directory - History|website=kirtland.baseguide.net}}</ref>

During the early 20th century, New Mexico's dry climate attracted many [[tuberculosis]] patients to the city in search of a cure,{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} this was before penicillin was found to be effective. Several sanitaria were developed on the [[West Mesa]] to serve TB patients. Presbyterian Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in the Southwest, had their beginnings during this period. Influential [[New Deal]]–era governor [[Clyde Tingley]] and famed Southwestern architect [[John Gaw Meem]] were among those who came to New Mexico seeking recovery from TB.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The first travelers on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] appeared in Albuquerque in 1926. Soon dozens of motels, restaurants, and gift shops sprouted along the roadside to serve them. Route 66 originally ran through the city on a north–south alignment along Fourth Street. In 1937 it was realigned along [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]], a more direct east–west route.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}  The intersection of Fourth and Central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades. The majority of the surviving structures from the Route 66 era are on Central, though there are also some on Fourth. Signs between Bernalillo and Los Lunas along the old route now have brown, historical highway markers denoting it as ''Pre-1937 Route 66.''{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The establishment of [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in 1939, [[Sandia Base]] in the early 1940s, and [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in 1949, would make Albuquerque a key player of the Atomic Age. Meanwhile, the city continued to expand outward into the Northeast Heights, reaching a population of 201,189 by 1960 per the U.S. Census.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1960/population-and-housing-phc-1/41953654v1ch2.pdf |title=U.S. Census of Population and Housing: 1960.

Following the end of WWII, population shifts as well as suburban development, [[urban sprawl]] and gentrification, Albuquerque's downtown entered a period of decline. Many historic buildings were razed in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for new plazas, high-rises, and parking lots as part of the city's urban renewal phase.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}  {{as of|2010}}, only recently has Downtown Albuquerque come to regain much of its urban character{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}, mainly through the construction of many new loft apartment buildings and the renovation of historic structures such as the [[KiMo Theater]].

During the 21st century, Albuquerque's population has continued to grow rapidly. The population of the city proper was estimated at 564,559 in 2020<ref>{{Cite web |title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Albuquerque_city,_New_Mexico?g=160XX00US3502000 |access-date=2024-11-07 |website=data.census.gov}}</ref>, 528,497 in 2009, and 448,607 in the 2000 census.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Erick |last=Siermers |title=Managing Albuquerque's growth |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |date=September 17, 2007 |access-date=September 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222005227/http://abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |archive-date=February 22, 2010 }}</ref> During 2005 and 2006, the city celebrated its tricentennial with a diverse program of cultural events.

Urban sprawl is limited on three sides—by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] to the north, the [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta Pueblo]] and Kirtland Air Force Base to the south, and the Sandia Mountains to the east. Suburban growth continues at a strong pace to the west, beyond the Petroglyph National Monument, once thought to be a natural boundary to sprawl development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/petr/ |title=Petroglyph National Monument |publisher=Nps.gov |date=June 10, 2010 |access-date=July 2, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100828110802/http://www.nps.gov/petr/| archive-date=August 28, 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

Because of less-costly land and lower taxes, much of the growth in the metropolitan area is taking place outside of the city of Albuquerque itself. In Rio Rancho to the northwest, the communities east of the mountains, and the incorporated parts of [[Valencia County]], population growth rates approach twice that of Albuquerque. The primary cities in Valencia County are [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] and [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions. The mountain towns of [[Tijeras, New Mexico|Tijeras]], [[Edgewood, New Mexico|Edgewood]], and [[Moriarty, New Mexico|Moriarty]], while close enough to Albuquerque to be considered suburbs, have experienced much less growth compared to Rio Rancho, Bernalillo, Los Lunas, and Belen. Limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns. The [[Mid Region Council of Governments]] (MRCOG), which includes constituents from throughout the Albuquerque area, was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle Rio Grande would be able to meet the needs of their rapidly rising populations. MRCOG's cornerstone project is currently the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}

Albuquerque is located in north-central New Mexico. To its east are the [[Sandia–Manzano Mountains]]. The [[Rio Grande]] flows north to south through its center, while the [[West Mesa]] and [[Petroglyph National Monument]] make up the western part of the city. Albuquerque has one of the highest elevations of any major city in the U.S., ranging from {{convert|4,900|ft|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] near the [[Rio Grande]] to over {{convert|6,700|ft|m}} in the foothill areas of [[Sandia Heights, New Mexico|Sandia Heights]] and Glenwood Hills.

The Rio Grande is classified, like the [[Nile]], as an "exotic" river. The New Mexico portion of the Rio Grande lies within the [[Rio Grande Rift]] Valley, bordered by a system of [[fault (geology)|fault]]s, including those that lifted up the adjacent [[Sandia Mountains|Sandia]] and [[Manzano Mountains]], while lowering the area where the life-sustaining Rio Grande now flows.

The [[Sandia Mountains]] are the predominant geographic feature visible in Albuquerque. ''Sandía'' is Spanish for "[[watermelon]]", and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant pink and green coloration of the mountains at sunset. The pink is due to large exposures of [[granodiorite]] cliffs, and the green is due to large swaths of [[conifer]] forests. However, Robert Julyan notes in ''The Place Names of New Mexico'', "the most likely explanation is the one believed by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo."<ref name="julyan">Robert Julyan, ''The Place Names of New Mexico'' (revised edition), UNM Press, 1998.</ref> He also notes that the Sandia Pueblo Indians call the mountain ''Bien Mur'', "Big Mountain."<ref name="julyan"/>

Albuquerque lies at the northern edge of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] transitioning into the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The Sandia Mountains represent the northern edge of the [[Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion]].

The environments of Albuquerque include the Rio Grande [[bosque]], (floodplain cottonwood forest), arid scrub, and mesas that turn into the Sandia foothills in the east. The Rio Grande's bosque has been significantly reduced and its natural flood cycle disrupted by dams built further upstream. A corridor of bosque surrounding the river within the city has been preserved as [[Rio Grande Valley State Park]].
[[File:South Diversion Channel, Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|The South Diversion Channel]]
A few remaining natural arroyos provide riparian habitat within the city, though natural [[Arroyo (watercourse)|arroyos]] draining into the Rio Grande have largely been replaced with concrete channels. After a series of floods in the 1950s, passage of the "Arroyo Flood Control Act of 1963" provided for the construction of a series of concrete diversion channels.<ref name="AMAFCA">{{cite book |last1=Swinburne |first1=Bernard H. |title=Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority |date=July 1974 |publisher=Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority |location=Albuquerque |pages=6–8 |url=https://amafca.org/documents/AMAFCABrochureweb.pdf |access-date=1 October 2024}}</ref> The network of channels was built by the Army Corps of Engineers during the 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name="AMAFCA" />

====Quadrants====

Albuquerque is geographically divided into four unequal [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] that are officially part of mailing addresses, placed immediately after the street name. They are Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). Albuquerque's official quadrant system uses Central Ave for the north–south division and the railroad tracks for the east–west division. I-25 and I-40 are also sometimes used informally to divide the city into quadrants.

=====Northeast=====

This quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s. It abuts the base of the Sandia Mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods, which are significantly higher in elevation than the rest of the city. Running from Central Ave and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Railrunner]] tracks to the [[Sandia Peak Tramway|Sandia Peak Aerial Tram]], this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population. Martineztown, the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], [[University of New Mexico]], the Uptown area, which includes three shopping malls ([[Coronado Center]], ABQ Uptown, and [[Winrock Town Center]]), Hoffmantown, Journal Center, and [[Cliff's Amusement Park]] are all in this quadrant.

Some of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are here, including: [[High Desert, Albuquerque, New Mexico|High Desert]], Tanoan, Sandia Heights, and North Albuquerque Acres. Parts of Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres are outside the city limits proper. A few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the [[Cibola National Forest]], just over the line into [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]].

=====Northwest=====

[[file:KiMo Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|[[KiMo Theater|KiMo Theatre]] in Downtown]]

This quadrant contains historic [[Old Town Albuquerque]], which dates to the 18th century, as well as the [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]]. The area has a mixture of commercial districts and low to high-income neighborhoods. Northwest Albuquerque includes the largest section of [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]], [[Rio Grande Nature Center State Park]] and the [[Bosque]] ("woodlands"), Petroglyph National Monument, [[Double Eagle II Airport]], the Paradise Hills neighborhood, Taylor Ranch, and [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood Mall]].

This quadrant also contains the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]] settlement, outside the city limits, which has some expensive homes and small ranches along the [[Rio Grande]]. The city of Albuquerque engulfs the village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]]. A small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the Petroglyphs, known as the "[[West Mesa]]" or "Westside", consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions, also extends into this quadrant. The city proper is bordered on the north by the North Valley, the village of [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]], and the city of [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]].

=====Southeast=====

[[file:Lobo Theater, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|[[Lobo Theater]] in Nob Hill]]

[[Kirtland Air Force Base]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]], Sandia Science & Technology Park, the Max Q commercial district, [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], [[Central New Mexico Community College]], [[University of New Mexico|UNM South Campus]], Presbyterian Hospital Duke City BMX, [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]], [[Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park]], [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]], [[Mesa del Sol]], [[Isleta Amphitheater]], [[Albuquerque Studios|Netflix Studios]], Isleta Resort & Casino, the [[National Museum of Nuclear Science & History]], New Mexico Veterans Memorial, and {{not a typo|Talin}}<!-- typo correction wants to correct this to Tallinn, capital of Estonia--> Market are all located in the Southeast quadrant of Albuquerque.

The southern half of the International District lies along Central Ave and Louisiana Blvd. Here, many immigrant communities have settled and thrive, having established numerous businesses.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} Albuquerque's [[Vietnamese American]] community is partly business-centered in this area, as well as the Eubank, Juan Tabo, and Central areas, and other parts of Albuquerque. There is also a [[Laotian American]] temple and a sizable community in parts of this area as well as around Uptown. There is also an African American community around Highland.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The Four Hills neighborhoods are located in and around the foothills on the outskirts of Southeast Albuquerque. The vast newer subdivision of Volterra lies west of the Four Hills area. Popular urban neighborhoods that can be found in Southeast Albuquerque include [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque|Nob Hill]], Ridgecrest, Parkland Hills, Hyder Park, and University Heights.

=====Southwest=====

Traditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods, the Southwest quadrant comprises the south-end of Downtown Albuquerque, the [[Barelas]] neighborhood, the rapidly growing west side, and the community of [[South Valley, New Mexico]], often called "The South Valley". The quadrant extends all the way to the Isleta Indian Reservation. Newer suburban subdivisions on the [[West Mesa]] near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction, some dating as far back as the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} This quadrant includes the old communities of Atrisco, Los Padillas, Huning Castle, Kinney, Westgate, Westside, Alamosa, Mountainview, and Pajarito. The Bosque ("woodlands"), the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], the [[Rio Grande Zoo]], and [[Tingley Beach]] are also here.

Albuquerque is located near the crossroads of several ecoregions. According to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-download-files-state-region-6|title=Ecoregion Download Files by State - Region 6|first=ORD|last=US EPA|date=March 9, 2016|website=US EPA|access-date=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215174613/https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-download-files-state-region-6|archive-date=December 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the city is located in the southeastern edge of the [[Arizona/New Mexico Plateau]], with the [[Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion]] defining the adjacent Sandia-Manzano mountains, including the foothills in the eastern edges of the city limits, above Juan Tabo Boulevard. Though the city lies at the northern edge of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] transitioning into the [[Colorado Plateau]], much of Albuquerque area west of the [[Sandia Mountains]] shares similar aridity, temperatures, and natural vegetation more with that of the Chihuahuan Desert, namely the desert grassland and sand scrub plant communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|title=NMSU: New Mexico Range Plants|website=aces.nmsu.edu|access-date=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503163417/https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|archive-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>

The eastern portion of the greater Albuquerque area are known as the East Mountain area, and they are within the [[Southwestern Tablelands]], sometimes considered a southern extension of the central high plains and northeast New Mexico highlands. To the north is the [[Southern Rockies]] ecoregion in the Jemez Mountains.

The average annual precipitation is less than half of evaporation supporting an [[arid climate]] (''BWk''), and no month's daily temperature mean is below freezing. The climate is rather mild compared to parts of the country further north or further south. However, due to the city's high elevation, low temperatures in winter often dip below freezing. Varied terrain and elevations within the city and outlying areas cause daily temperature differentials to vary. The daily average temperatures in December and January, the coldest months, are above freezing at {{convert|36.9|°F}} and {{convert|37.4|°F}}, respectively.

Albuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.<ref name="noaasun" /><ref name="NOAA">{{cite web

}}</ref> Brilliant sunshine defines the region, averaging 278&nbsp;days a year; periods of variably mid and high-level cloudiness temper the sun, mostly during the cooler months. Extended cloudiness lasting longer than two or three days is rare.

Winter typically consists of cool days and cold nights, except following passage of the strongest cold fronts and arctic airmasses when daytime temperatures remain colder than average; overnight temperatures tend to fall below freezing between about 10 pm and 8 am in the city, except during colder airmasses, plus colder spots of the valley and most of the East Mountain areas. December, the coolest month, averages {{convert|36.9|°F|1}}; the median or normal coolest temperature of the year is {{convert|12|°F|0}}, while the average or mean is about {{convert|11|°F|0}}. It is typical for daily low temperatures in much of late December, and January, and February to be below freezing, with a long-term average of 93 days per year falling to or below freezing, and two days failing to rise above freezing. In March, winds dominate as the temperatures began to warm late in the winter.<ref name = NOAA1/>

Spring is windy, sometimes unsettled with rain, though spring is usually the driest part of the year in Albuquerque. Late March and April tend to experience many days with the wind blowing at {{convert|20|to|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} In May, the winds tend to subside as a summer-like airmass and temperatures begin to occur into with regularity. The warming and drying trend continues into June. By mid-June, temperatures can exceed {{convert|100|°F|0}}.

Summer is lengthy and very warm to hot, relatively tolerable for most people because of low humidity and air movement. The exception is some days during the [[New Mexico monsoon]], when daily humidity remains relatively high, especially in July and August. 2.6 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}} or warmer highs occur annually on average, mostly in June and July and rarely in August due in part to the monsoon; an average of 64 days experience {{convert|90|°F|0}} or warmer highs.<ref name = NOAA1/> Despite the rarity of such heat, 28 days with highs at or above {{convert|100|°F|0}} occurred in the summer of 1980 at Albuquerque's Sunport.

Autumn is generally cool in the mornings and nights but sees less rain than summer, though the weather can be more unsettled closer to winter, as colder airmasses and weather patterns build in from the north and northwest with more frequency.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} Occasionally, snow will fall in late autumn in December; rarely in late November.

Precipitation averages {{convert|8.84|in|mm|0}} per year. On average, January is the driest month, while July and August are the wettest months, as a result of shower and thunderstorm activity produced by the monsoon prevalent over the Southwestern United States. Most rain occurs during the late summer monsoon season, typically starting in early June and ending in mid-September.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

Albuquerque averages {{convert|7.9|in|cm|0}} of snow per winter, and experiences several accumulating snow events each season. Locations in the Northeast Heights and Eastern Foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region's higher elevation and proximity to the mountains. The city was one of several in the region experiencing a severe winter storm on December 28–30, 2006, with locations in Albuquerque receiving between {{convert|10.5|and|26|in|cm}} of snow.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/climate/Monthlyreports/December/2006/PNS12312006.htm|title = Preliminary total snowfall reports across central and northern New Mexico from the December 28–30 winter storm|date = December 31, 2006|access-date = August 5, 2009|publisher = National Weather Service Albuquerque, NM|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120223134054/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/?n=monthly-summaries|archive-date = February 23, 2012|url-status = live}}</ref> More recently, a major winter storm in late February 2015 dropped up to a foot (30&nbsp;cm) of snow on most of the city. Such large snowfalls are rare occurrences during the period of record, and they greatly impact traffic movement and the workforce due to their rarity.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The mountains and highlands east of the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air descending the mountains; the Sandia Mountain foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about {{convert|10–17|in|mm|0}} annually.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} Traveling west, north, and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}  One such area is considered part of Albuquerque Metropolitan Area, commonly called the East Mountain area; it is covered in woodlands of juniper and piñon trees, a common trait of southwestern uplands and the southernmost Rocky Mountains.

===Hydrology===

Albuquerque's drinking water comes from a combination of Rio Grande water (river water diverted from the [[Colorado River]] basin through the [[San Juan–Chama Project]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Your Drinking Water| url=http://www.abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| access-date=August 1, 2013| website=Albuquerque Bernalillo Water Authority| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805163835/http://abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| archive-date=August 5, 2013}}</ref>) and a delicate [[aquifer]] that has been described as an "underground [[Lake Superior]]". The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) has developed a water resources management strategy that pursues [[water conservation|conservation]] and the direct extraction of water from the Rio Grande for the development of a stable underground aquifer in the future.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Odenwald |first=Arlene Cinelli |date=April 1993 |title=Protecting the aquifer: Albuquerque reacting |journal=New Mexico Business Journal |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=38–39 |issn=0164-6796 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109101124/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429 |archive-date=November 9, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2008}}</ref><ref name="water strategy">{{cite web| title=Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority: Water Resource Management Strategy |website=Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |date=January 10, 2007 |url=http://www.abcwua.org/pdfs/WRMS_Update_101207.pdf |access-date=October 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029020514/http://www.abcwua.org/pdfs/WRMS_Update_101207.pdf |archive-date=October 29, 2008 }}</ref>

[[file:Tingley Beach Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Tingley Beach in Old Town, Albuquerque, a pond in a former watercourse by the Rio Grande]]

The aquifer of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]] is too [[brackish water|saline]] to be cost-effectively used for drinking. Much of the [[rain]]water Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[Arroyo (watercourse)|arroyo]]s and empties into the [[Rio Grande]].

Of the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan–Chama Project]]. The project's construction was initiated by legislation signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.<ref>The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website {{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |title=Project details - San Juan-Chama Project - Bureau of Reclamation |access-date=October 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925123715/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |archive-date=September 25, 2012 }}</ref>

The ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable-height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s that lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande silvery minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060. [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder. One of the policies of the ABCWUA's strategy is the acquisition of additional river water.<ref name="water strategy"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/34/27/ |title=The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |publisher=Abcwua.org |date=December 7, 2008 |access-date=July 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507020947/http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/34/27/ |archive-date=May 7, 2010}}</ref> {{Rp|Policy G, 14}}

As for [[sports radio]] there is [[KNML]] "The Sports Animal" and [[KQTM]] "The Team".

===Food and agriculture===

As a large and multicultural city, Albuquerque is home to a variety of [[global cuisine]]s, in addition to local [[New Mexican cuisine]]. [[:Category:Restaurants in Albuquerque, New Mexico|Many local restaurants]] receive statewide attention, with several becoming [[restaurant chain|chains]]; the city hosts the headquarters of [[Blake's Lotaburger]], [[Little Anita's]], [[Twisters (restaurant)|Twisters]], [[Dion's]], [[Boba Tea Company]], and [[Sadie's]], most of which offer New Mexican fare.

As the focus of the [[Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District]], the city is punctuated by agricultural [[acequia]]s that contrast with the otherwise heavily urban settings. Crops such as [[New Mexico chile]] are grown along the entire Rio Grande; the red or green chile pepper is a staple of New Mexican cuisine and widely available in restaurants, including national fast-food chains. Likewise, the Albuquerque metro is a major contributor to the [[Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA]], where [[New Mexico wine]] is produced at several vineyards; the river also provides trade access to the [[Mesilla Valley]] to the south (containing [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] and [[El Paso, Texas]]), with its [[Mesilla Valley AVA|own wine offerings]], and the adjacent [[Hatch, New Mexico|Hatch Valley]], which is well known for its New Mexico chile peppers. Albuquerque also has a burgeoning [[List of breweries in New Mexico|brewery scene.]]

Hundreds of hot-air balloons are seen every day, and there is live music, arts and crafts, and food.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.balloonfiesta.com/guest-guide| title=Guest Info| website=Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta| access-date=September 11, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906111828/http://www.balloonfiesta.com/guest-guide| archive-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref>

===Architecture===

{{see also|list of tallest buildings in Albuquerque}}

[[file:2013, A Walk in Old Town Albuquerque - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Old Town Albuquerque]] is filled with [[Territorial Style]] architecture and design.]]

The original architecture of ''La Villa de Albuquerque'' is referred to as the [[Territorial Style]], it was revitalized as the [[Territorial Revival architecture]]. Architect [[John Gaw Meem]] is often credited with this revival.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

John Gaw Meem is also credited with developing and popularizing the [[Pueblo Revival]] style, which was based in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] but received an important Albuquerque commission in 1933 as the architect of the [[University of New Mexico]]. He retained this commission for the next quarter-century and developed the university's distinctive Southwest style.<ref name="Simmons" /> {{Rp|317}} Meem also designed the [[Cathedral Church of St. John (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cathedral Church of St. John]] in 1950.<ref name="diocese">{{cite web| url=http://www.dioceserg.org/pages/view/history_of_the_diocese| title=History of the Diocese|publisher=Diocese of the Rio Grande| access-date=January 3, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328194349/http://www.dioceserg.org/pages/view/history_of_the_diocese| archive-date=March 28, 2014}}</ref>

[[Pueblo Deco architecture]] was derived from Pueblo and Territorial styles meeting the [[Art Deco]] movement, and it is richly featured in [[downtown Albuquerque]]. Albuquerque boasts a unique nighttime cityscape, personified in the lights of Albuquerque, a common motif in art and song.<ref name="When The Cowboy Sings 2021">{{cite web | title=Jim Glaser performs "The Lights of Albuquerque" Live On The Marty Stuart Show. | website=When The Cowboy Sings | date=May 2, 2021 | url=https://whentcowboysings.com/jim-glaser-the-lights-of-albuquerque/ | access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web | title=Lights of Albuquerque by Billy Mize - Track Info | website=AllMusic | url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/lights-of-albuquerque-mt0055255738 | access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic 2007">{{cite web | title=The Lights of Albuquerque by Pat Duran - Track Info | website=AllMusic | date=February 14, 2007 | url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-lights-of-albuquerque-mt0016725986 | access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref> The city lights twinkle and glitter from views on Nine Mile Hill, it was among [[Elvis Presley]]'s favorite views.<ref name="City of Albuquerque 2022">{{cite web | title=Fashion in 1950s Albuquerque | website=City of Albuquerque | date=March 14, 2022 | url=https://www.cabq.gov/artsculture/albuquerque-museum/museum-collections/history/online-history-exhibitions/fashion-in-1950s-albuquerque | access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref> [[Route 66]] era neon signs, and LED style versions of the neon-style are common throughout the city.

The [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the county courthouse is illuminated yellow, while the tops of the Bank of Albuquerque and the Bank of the West are illuminated reddish-yellow. Due to the nature of the soil in the Rio Grande Valley, the skyline is lower than might be expected in a city of comparable size elsewhere, and it was used to highlight the low-lying architecture of heritage Pueblo and Hispano architectural styles.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

[[file:Albuquerque Roosevelt Park.JPG|thumb|right|[[Roosevelt Park (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Roosevelt Park]] is a historic park in central Albuquerque.]]

Albuquerque has expanded greatly in area since the mid-1940s. During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post-1940s areas. The older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four- to six-lane roads in a <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(1.61&nbsp;km)</span> grid. Each <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&nbsp;square mile&nbsp;(2.59&nbsp;km{{sup|2}})</span> is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set <span style="white-space:nowrap">0.5&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(0.8&nbsp;km)</span> between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

===Libraries===

The [[Albuquerque Bernalillo County Library]] system consists of nineteen libraries to serve the city, including the [[Main Library (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Main Library]], Special Collections branch ([[Old Main Library (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Old Main Library]]), and [[Ernie Pyle House/Library|Ernie Pyle branch]], which is located in the former home of noted war correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abqlibrary.org/about-us/mission|title=LibGuides: About Us: Mission}}</ref> The Old Main Library was the first library of Albuquerque and from 1901 until 1948 it was the only public library. The original library was donated to the state by Joshua and Sarah Raynolds. After suffering some fire damage in 1923 the city decided it was time to construct a building for the library to be moved to, however, by 1970 even after additions were made the population and library needs had outgrown the building for its use as a main library and it was turned into Special Collections. The Old Main Library was recognized as a landmark in September 1979.
It was not until 1974 with the movement of the South Valley Library into a new building that the Bernalillo built and administered a public library. Not long after, in 1986, the Bernalillo and Albuquerque government decided that joint powers would work best to serve the needs of the community and created the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abqlibrary.org/libraryhistory|title = LibGuides: Library History: A Brief History of the Public Library}}</ref>

===Parks and recreation===

The [[Bosque]] is a major outdoors area in the city, it has to numerous [[hiking]] and [[biking]] trails. The [[Sandia–Manzano Mountains]] and [[West Mesa]] also have many hiking trails, such as [[La Luz Trail]] and [[Petroglyph National Monument]]. According to the Trust for Public Land, Albuquerque has 291 public parks as of 2017, most of which are administered by the city Parks and Recreation Department. The total amount of parkland is 42.9 square miles (111 km2), or about 23% of the city's total area—one of the highest percentages among large cities in the U.S. About 82% of city residents live within walking distance of a park.

The [[Albuquerque Biological Park]] manages the [[ABQ BioPark Botanic Garden]], [[ABQ BioPark Aquarium]], [[Tingley Beach]], and [[ABQ BioPark Zoo]]. Amusement parks in the city include [[Cliff's Amusement Park]] and Hinkle Family Fun Center;<ref name="Casselle 2010 p. 148">{{cite book | last=Casselle | first=T. | title=Insiders' Guide® to Albuquerque | publisher=Insider's Guide | series=Insiders' Guide Series | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-7627-6278-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrW1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA148 | language=ku | access-date=June 30, 2022 | page=148}}</ref> there was formerly [[The Beach (waterpark)|The Beach waterpark]], which became a vacant lot on Desert Surf Circle for several years, until [[Topgolf]] made a [[driving range]] in the lot.<ref name="KRQE Topgolf">{{cite web | title=Groundbreaking takes place for Topgolf | website=KRQE NEWS 13 - Breaking News, Albuquerque News, New Mexico News, Weather, and Videos | date=February 27, 2019 | url=https://www.krqe.com/news/groundbreaking-takes-place-for-topgolf/ | access-date=June 30, 2022}}</ref>

=== Traditional arts ===

Albuquerque is home to over 300 other visual arts, music, dance, literary, film, ethnic, and craft organizations, museums, festivals and associations, and the state's capital Santa Fe is known for being a major [[arts city]]. One of the major art events in the state is the summertime New Mexico Arts and Crafts Fair, a nonprofit show exclusively for New Mexico artists and held annually in Albuquerque since 1961.<ref>{{cite book

===Transportation===

====Main highways====

Some of the main highways in the metro area include:
* [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|Pan-American Freeway]]:<ref name="Bryan">{{cite book| last=Bryan| first=Howard| title=Albuquerque Remembered| publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press]]| location=Albuquerque| year=1989| isbn=0-8263-3782-1| oclc=62109913| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSQAbMtClsYC&q=%22Pan%20American%20Freeway%22%20%22Coronado%20Freeway%22&pg=PA248|access-date=August 5, 2009}}</ref>{{Rp|248}} More commonly known as [[Interstate 25]] or "I-25", it is the main north–south highway on the city's eastern side of the [[Rio Grande]]. It is also the main north–south highway in the state (by connecting Albuquerque with [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]) and a plausible route of the eponymous [[Pan American Highway]]. Since [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] was decommissioned in the 1980s, the only remaining US highway in Albuquerque, unsigned [[US-85]], shares its alignment with I-25. [[US-550]] splits off to the northwest from I-25/US-85 in [[Bernalillo, New Mexico|Bernalillo]].
* [[Interstate 40 in New Mexico|Coronado Freeway]]:<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}} More commonly known as [[Interstate 40]] or "I-40", it is the city's main east–west traffic artery and an important transcontinental route. The freeway's name in the city is in reference to 16th century [[conquistador]] and explorer [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]].
* [[Paseo del Norte]]: (aka; New Mexico State Highway 423): This 6-lane [[controlled-access highway]] is approximately five miles north of Interstate 40. It runs as a surface road with at-grade intersections from Tramway Boulevard (at the base of the Sandia Mountains) to Interstate 25, after which it continues as a controlled-access freeway through Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, over the Rio Grande to North Coors Boulevard. Paseo Del Norte then continues west as a surface road through the Petroglyph National Monument until it reaches Atrisco Vista Boulevard and the Double Eagle II Airport. The interchange with Interstate 25 was reconstructed in 2014 to improve traffic flow.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cabq.gov/mayor/priorities-initiatives/initiatives/abq-the-plan/paseo-del-norte-at-i-25-interchange |title=Paseo del Norte at I-25 Interchange — City of Albuquerque |access-date=October 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013206/https://www.cabq.gov/mayor/priorities-initiatives/initiatives/abq-the-plan/paseo-del-norte-at-i-25-interchange |archive-date=October 13, 2017 }} Paseo del Norte at I-25 Interchange Reconstruction Project – City of Albuquerque</ref>
* [[Coors Boulevard]]: Coors is the main north–south artery to the west of the Rio Grande in Albuquerque. There is one full [[interchange (road)#Complete and incomplete interchanges|interchange]] where it connects with Interstate 40; The rest of the route connects to other roads with at-grade intersections controlled by [[stoplight]]s. The Interstate 25 underpass has no access to Coors. Parts of the highway have [[sidewalk]]s, [[bike lane]]s, and [[Median strip|median]]s, but most sections have only dirt shoulders and a center turn lane. To the north of Interstate 40, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 448|State Highway 448]], while to the south, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 45|State Highway 45]].
* [[New Mexico State Road 500|Rio Bravo Boulevard]]: The main river crossing between Westside Albuquerque and the [[Sunport]], Rio Bravo is a four-lane [[divided highway]] that runs from University Boulevard in the east, through the South Valley, to Coors Boulevard in the west where it is contiguous with Dennis Chaves Boulevard. It follows [[New Mexico State Road 500|NM-500]] for its entire route.
* [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]]: Central is one of the historical routings of [[US Highway 66|Route 66]], it is no longer a main through highway, its usefulness having been supplanted by Interstate 40.<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}}
* [[New Mexico State Road 528|Alameda Boulevard]]: The main road between Rio Rancho and North Albuquerque, Alameda Boulevard stretches from Tramway Road to Coors Boulevard The route is designated as the eastern portion of [[New Mexico State Road 528|NM-528]].
* [[New Mexico State Road 556|Tramway Boulevard]]: Serves as a bypass around the northeastern quadrant, the route is designated as [[New Mexico State Road 556|NM-556]]. Tramway Boulevard starts at I-25 near Sandia Pueblo, and heads east as a two-lane road. It turns south near the base of the [[Sandia Peak Tramway]] and becomes an expressway-type divided highway until its terminus near I-40 and Central Avenue by the western entrance to [[Tijeras Canyon]].

The [[interchange (road)|interchange]] between I-40 and I-25 is known as the "[[Big I]]".<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}} Originally built in 1966, it was rebuilt in 2002. The Big I is the only [[Stack interchange#Five-level stack|five-level stack interchange]] in the state of New Mexico.

====Bridges====

There are six road bridges that cross the [[Rio Grande]] and serve the municipality on at least one end if not both. The eastern approaches of the northernmost three all pass through adjacent unincorporated areas, the Village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]], or the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]]. In downstream order they are:
* '''Alameda Bridge'''
* '''Paseo del Norte Bridge'''
* '''Montaño Bridge'''
* ''' I-40 Bridge'''
* '''Central at Old Town Bridge'''
* '''Barelas Bridge'''

Two more bridges serve [[Urban area#United States|urbanized area]]s contiguous to the city's perforated southern boundary.
* '''Rio Bravo Bridge''' ([[New Mexico State Road 500|NM-500]])
* '''I-25 Bridge''' (near [[Isleta Pueblo]])

====Rail====

[[file:downtown Albuquerque stn look south.JPG|thumb|Rail Runner Express Downtown Albuquerque station train platform]]

The state owns most of the city's rail infrastructure which is used by a commuter rail system, long-distance passenger trains, and the freight trains of the [[BNSF Railway]].

====Freight service====

[[BNSF Railway]] operates a small yard operation out of Abajo yard, located just south of the César E. Chávez Ave. overpass and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] yards. Most freight traffic through the Central New Mexico region is processed via a much larger hub in nearby [[Belen, New Mexico]].

====Intercity rail====

[[Amtrak]]'s [[Southwest Chief]], which travels between Chicago and Los Angeles, serves the Albuquerque area daily with one stop in each direction at the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] in downtown.

====Intercity Bus Services====

[[Greyhound Lines]] and [[FlixBus]] offer intercity transportation services to the [[Albuquerque metropolitan area|Albuquerque Metro Area]] as well as transportation to other cities around the United States.

====Commuter rail====

The [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]], a [[commuter rail]] line, began service between [[Sandoval County]] and Albuquerque in July 2006 using an existing [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] right-of-way which was purchased by New Mexico in 2005. Service expanded to [[Valencia County]] in December 2006 and to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on December 17, 2008. Rail Runner now connects [[Santa Fe County|Santa Fe]], Sandoval, [[Bernalillo County|Bernalillo]], and Valencia Counties with thirteen station stops, including three stops within Albuquerque.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Mexico Rail Runner Express: Stations listed North to South |url=http://www.nmrailrunner.com/stations.asp |publisher=New Mexico Rail Runner |access-date=August 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106174708/http://www.nmrailrunner.com/stations.asp |archive-date=January 6, 2012 }}</ref>
The trains connect Albuquerque to downtown Santa Fe with eight roundtrips per weekday. The section of the line running south to [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]] is served less frequently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmrailrunner.com/PDF/Weekday%20Schedule%20SF%2012-08.pdf |title=New Mexico Rail Runner Express Monday–Friday Schedule |access-date=December 23, 2008 |publisher=New Mexico Rail Runner Express |date=December 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114191537/http://www.nmrailrunner.com/PDF/Weekday%20Schedule%20SF%2012-08.pdf |archive-date=January 14, 2009 }}</ref>

Albuquerque was one of two cities in New Mexico to have had an electric street railway; its horse-drawn streetcar lines were electrified in the early 20th century. The Albuquerque Traction Company assumed operation of the system in 1905, and it grew to its maximum length of {{convert|6|mi|km}} over the next ten years, connecting destinations such as [[Old Town Albuquerque|Old Town]] to the west and the [[University of New Mexico]] to the east with the town's urban center near the former [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] depot. The Albuquerque Traction Company failed financially in 1915 and the City Electric Company was formed in its place. Despite traffic booms during the First World War, and unaided by lawsuits attempting to force the streetcar company to pay for paving, that system also failed later in 1927, leaving the [[streetcar]]'s "motorettes" unemployed.<ref name="Myrick">{{cite book |last=Myrick |first=David F |title=New Mexico's Railroads --- An Historical Survey |publisher=Colorado Railroad Museum |year=1970 |location=Golden, Colorado |id=Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 70-116915}}</ref>{{Rp|177–181}}

In 2006, under Mayor [[Martin Chavez]], Albuquerque planned a "fast track" development of a "Modern Streetcar" project, which would run mostly in the southeast quadrant on Central Avenue and Yale Boulevard.
