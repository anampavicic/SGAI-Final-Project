'''Akron''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|r|ən}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Summit County, Ohio]], United States. At the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city proper had a total population of 190,469, making it the [[List of municipalities in Ohio|fifth-most populous city]] in Ohio and [[List of United States cities by population|136th-most populous city]] in the U.S. The [[Akron metropolitan area]], covering Summit and [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage]] counties, had a population of 702,219.<ref name="FactFinder">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=January 6, 2013}}</ref> It is located on the western edge of the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]] in [[Northeast Ohio]] about {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of downtown [[Cleveland]].

After being first settled by Miner Spicer in 1810,<ref name=":0" /> the city was founded by [[Simon Perkins]] and Paul Williams in 1825 along the [[Cuyahoga River|Little Cuyahoga River]] at the summit of the developing [[Ohio and Erie Canal]]. The name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄκρον}} ({{em|ákron}}), signifying a summit or high point. It was briefly renamed South Akron after Eliakim Crosby founded nearby North Akron in 1833, until both merged into an incorporated village in 1836. In the 1910s, Akron doubled in population, making it the nation's fastest-growing city.

A long history of rubber and tire manufacturing, carried on today by the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]], gave Akron the nickname "Rubber Capital of the World".

==History==
[[File:TownplotpfAkron.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Original town plot of Akron]]

The first settler in the Akron area was Major Miner Spicer,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Oscar |date=October 23, 1952 |title=He Digs Up History Of City's Street Names |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-akron-beacon-journal/30692687/ |access-date=March 2, 2024 |work=[[The Akron Beacon Journal]] |pages=33}}</ref> who came from [[Groton, Connecticut]]. He built a [[log cabin]] in the forest in 1810, and became the region's first citizen.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=First Universalist Church |date=1904 |title=Views of Akron, Ohio and Environs |url=https://www.akronlibrary.org/images/SpecCol/views_of_akron.pdf |page=4}}</ref> In June 1811, Spicer sent for his family, who came that same year by ox teams accompanied by Capt. Amos Spicer and Paul Williams.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Portrait and Biographical Record of Portage and Summit Counties, Ohio |publisher=A. W. Bowen & Company |year=1898 |pages=307}}</ref>

In 1811, Paul Williams settled near the corner of what is now Buchtel Avenue and Broadway. He suggested to General [[Simon Perkins]], who was surveyor of the [[Connecticut Land Company]]'s [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], that they found a town at the summit of the developing [[Ohio and Erie Canal]]. The name is adapted from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄκρον}} ({{em|ákron}}), meaning summit or high point.<ref>{{LSJ|a)/kron|ἄκρον|ref}}.</ref> It was laid out in December 1825, where the south part of the downtown Akron neighborhood sits today. Irish laborers working on the [[Ohio Canal]] built about 100 cabins nearby.

After Eliakim Crosby founded "North Akron" (also known as Cascade) in the northern portion of what is now downtown Akron in 1833, "South" was added to Akron's name until about three years later, when the two were merged and became an incorporated village in 1836.<ref name=ReferenceA>{{cite web|title=Akron's Historic Timeline: 1800–1849|url=http://www.akronohio.gov/cms/site/2cdaf98b9523ff5c/index.html|publisher=City of Akron|access-date=June 9, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607103741/http://www.akronohio.gov/cms/site/2cdaf98b9523ff5c/index.html|archive-date=June 7, 2015}}</ref> In 1840, Summit County formed from portions of [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage]], [[Medina County, Ohio|Medina]], and [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark]] Counties. Akron replaced [[Cuyahoga Falls]] as its county seat a year later and opened a canal connecting to [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]], helping give birth to the stoneware, sewer pipe, fishing tackle, and farming equipment industries.<ref name="akronhistory.org"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/> In 1844, abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] moved into the [[John Brown House (Akron, Ohio)|John Brown House]] across the street from business partner [[Colonel Simon Perkins]], who lived in the [[Perkins Stone Mansion]].

When the Ohio Women's Rights Convention came to Akron in 1851, Sojourner Truth extemporaneously delivered her speech named "[[Ain't I A Woman?]]", at the Universalist Old Stone Church. In 1870, a local businessman associated with the church, [[John R. Buchtel]], founded Buchtel College, which became the [[University of Akron]] in 1913.

[[Ferdinand Schumacher]] bought a mill in 1856, and the following decade mass-produced [[oat|oat bars]] for the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]; these continued to sell well after the war. Akron incorporated as a city in 1865.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Philanthropist [[Lewis Miller (philanthropist)|Lewis Miller]], Walter Blythe, and architect Jacob Snyder designed the widely used [[Akron Plan]], debuting it on Akron's First Methodist Episcopal Church in 1872.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" /> Numerous [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Baptist]], and [[Presbyterian]] churches built between the 1870s and World War I use it.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eYNjS56yx-0C&pg=PA185 |title=When Church Became Theatre: The Transformation of Evangelical Architecture and Worship in Nineteenth-Century America|first= Jeanne Halgren|last = Kilde|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|date= 2005|isbn = 978-0-19-517972-9|page =185}}</ref><ref name="American Religious Buildings" /> In 1883, a local journalist began the modern toy industry by founding the Akron Toy Company.

Other popular inventions include rubber balloons, ducks, dolls, balls, baby buggy bumpers, and little brown jugs.

The city also continues to deal with the effects of air and [[soil pollution]] from its industrial past. In the southwestern part of the city, soil was contaminated and noxious [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-laden fumes were put into the air by an electrical transformer deconstruction operation that existed from the 1930s to the 1960s. Cleanup of the site, designated as a [[Superfund]] site by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], began in 1987 and concluded in 2000.

===Racial history===
{{See also|City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health}}
City founder [[Simon Perkins]] negotiated a treaty with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to establish a mail route from the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] to Detroit in 1807, an early example of historic humanitarian affairs in Akron. Aside from being part of the [[Underground Railroad]], when active, [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was a resident, today having two landmarks (the John Brown House and the John Brown Monument) dedicated to him. During the 1851 Women's Rights Convention, [[Sojourner Truth]] delivered her speech entitled "[[Ain't I A Woman?]]". In 1905, a statue of an Indian named Unk was erected on Portage Path, which was part of the effective western boundary of the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|White]] and [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native American]] lands from 1785 to 1805.<ref name="ASCPL Digital Exhibit"/> The [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]] chapter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] reported having 50,000 members, making it the largest local chapter in the country during the 20th century. At some point the sheriff, county officials, mayor of Akron, judges, county commissioners, and most members of Akron's school board were members. The Klan's influence in the city's politics eventually ended after [[Wendell Willkie]] arrived and challenged them.<ref name="Ku Klux Klan - Ohio History Central - A product of the Ohio Historical Society"/> Race played a part in two of Akron's major riots, the Riot of 1900 and the Wooster Ave. Riots of 1968. Others giving speeches on race in the city include [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]] (1920)<ref name="Akron: Akron's Black History Timeline: 1900-1919: The New Century"/> and President [[Bill Clinton]] (1997).<ref name="Akron Ohio Historical Timeline 1950 - 1999"/> In 1971, [[Alpha Phi Alpha|Alpha Phi Alpha Homes Inc.]] was founded in Akron by the Eta Tau Lambda chapter, with [[James R. Williams (lawyer)|James R. Williams]] as chairman. The centerpiece, [[Henry Arthur Callis|Henry Arthur Callis Tower]], is located in the Channelwood Village area of the city. In 2008, 91-year-old Akron native, Addie Polk, became the [[poster child]] of the [[Great Recession]], after shooting herself.<ref name="Ohio foreclosure prompts suicide attempt"/> In 2022, Akron resident [[Jayland Walker]] was killed by police after shooting at them while fleeing, sparking days of protest and the institution of a police review board.

==Geography==
Akron is located in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] about {{convert|39|mi|km}} south of [[Lake Erie]], on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]]. It is bordered by [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio|Cuyahoga Falls]] on the north and [[Barberton, Ohio|Barberton]] in the southwest. It is the center of the [[Akron metropolitan area]] which covers Summit and Portage Counties, and a principal city of the larger [[Northeast Ohio#Combined Statistical Area|Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area]]. Located on the western end of the plateau, the topography of Akron includes rolling hills and varied terrain. The [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] passes through the city, separating the east from west. Akron has the only [[biogas]] facility<ref name="Hungry Bacteria Begins Saving Akron Money"/> in the United States that produces [[methane]] through the decomposition process of sludge to create electricity.<ref name="Akron leads the way"/>
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of {{convert|62.37|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|62.03|sqmi}} (or 99.45%) is land and {{convert|0.34|sqmi}} (or 0.55%) is water.<ref>{{cite web

===Neighborhoods===
{{Main|Neighborhoods in Akron, Ohio}}
Akron consists of 21 neighborhoods, with an additional three that are unincorporated but recognized within the city. The neighborhoods of the city differ in design largely because of expansions such as town merging, annexation, housing construction in various time periods, and rubber era.

Maple Valley covers the west end of Copley Road, before reaching I-77. Along this strip are several businesses using the name, as well as the Maple Valley Branch of the [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]]. Spicertown falls under the blanket of University Park, this term is used frequently to describe the student-centered retail and residential area around East Exchange and Spicer streets, near the University of Akron. West Hill is roughly bounded by West Market Street on the north, West Exchange Street on the south, Downtown on the East, and Rhodes Avenue on the west. It features many stately older homes, particularly in the recently recognized Oakdale Historic District.

===Suburbs===
Akron's suburbs include [[Barberton, Ohio|Barberton]], [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio|Cuyahoga Falls]], [[Fairlawn, Ohio|Fairlawn]], [[Green, Ohio|Green]], [[Hudson, Ohio|Hudson]], [[Mogadore, Ohio|Mogadore]], [[Montrose-Ghent, Ohio|Montrose-Ghent]], [[Munroe Falls, Ohio|Munroe Falls]], [[Norton, Ohio|Norton]], [[Silver Lake, Ohio|Silver Lake]], [[Stow, Ohio|Stow]], and [[Tallmadge, Ohio|Tallmadge]].

According to census data from 2010 to 2014, the median income for a household in the city was $34,139. The per capita income for the city was $17,596. About 26.7% of persons were in poverty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3901000|title=Population estimates, July 1, 2015, (V2015)|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411162339/http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3901000|archive-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

The population of the [[Akron metropolitan area]] was 702,219 in 2020. Akron is also part of the larger [[Northeast Ohio|Cleveland-Akron-Canton combined statistical area]], which was the 15th largest in the country with a population of over 3.5 million residents. Akron experienced a significant collapse in population having lost over one third (34.4%) of its population between 1960 and 2020.

Although Akron is in northern Ohio, where the [[Inland North]] dialect is expected, its settlement history puts it in the North Midland dialect area.<ref name="Language Log: Wut? Wen?

Akron is home to [[E. J. Thomas Hall]], one of three Akron performance halls. Regular acts include the [[Akron Symphony Orchestra]], Tuesday Musical Club, and Children's Concert Society. World-class performances events include Broadway musicals, ballets, comedies, lectures, entertainers, attracting 400,000 visitors annually. The hall seats 2,955, divided among three tiers. To maintain top-notch acoustic sound, the counter-weighted ceiling is adjustable, altering the physical dimensions of the hall. Located downtown is the [[Akron Civic Theatre]], which opened in 1929 as the Loew's Theater. This atmospheric-style theater was designed by John Eberson and built by Marcus Loew. The theater contains many Moorish features including arches and decorative tiles. It features elaborate wood carvings, alabaster statuary, and European antiques. The theater seats 5,000. Behind it on the canal is the Lock 3 Park [[amphitheater]], which annually host the [[First Night]] in Akron. The [[Akron Art Museum]] also downtown, features art produced since 1850 along with national and international exhibitions.<ref name="Museum Collection: On View Now"/> It opened in 1922 as the Akron Art Institute, in the basement of the [[Akron Public Library]]. It moved to its current location at the renovated 1899 post office building in 1981. In 2007, the museum more than tripled in size with the addition of the John S. and James L. Knight Building, which received the 2005 American Architecture Award from the Chicago Athenaeum<ref name="Akron Art Museum"/> while still under construction.<ref name="Architecture"/><ref name="Museum History"/>

As a result of multiple towns merging, and industry boom, Akron's architecture is diverse.

Originally a canal town, the city is divided into two parts by the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]], with downtown being centered on it. Along the locks, the city has a path paved with rubber.

Akron was awarded with the [[World's most livable cities|City Livability Award]] in 2008 for its efforts to co-purpose new school buildings as community learning centers. In 2009, the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] designated Akron as a [[Tree City USA]] for the 14th time.<ref name="Ci.akron.oh.us">{{cite press release|title=Akron Named Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation|date=April 17, 2009|publisher=City of Akron|url=http://ci.akron.oh.us/News_Releases/2009/0417.htm|access-date=June 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927151804/http://ci.akron.oh.us/News_Releases/2009/0417.htm|archive-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall and the [[Summit County Courthouse (Ohio)|Summit County Courthouse]] are from pre-World War Two, but the [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]], and [[John S. Knight Center]] are considerably newer. The library originally opened in 1969, but reopened as a greatly expanded facility in 2004. The Knight Center opened in 1994.

The First Methodist Episcopal Church first used the [[Akron Plan]] in 1872. The plan later gained popularity, being used in many [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Baptists|Baptist]], and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church buildings.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eYNjS56yx-0C&pg=PA269 ''When Church Became Theatre: The Transformation of Evangelical Architecture and Worship in Nineteenth-Century America''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102221215/https://books.google.com/books?id=eYNjS56yx-0C&pg=PA269&dq=John+Fletcher+Hurst+- |date=January 2, 2016 }}.

Major parks in Akron include Lock 3, Firestone, Goodyear Heights, the F.A. Seiberling Nature Realm (or Naturealm), and part of the [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]]. Several of the parks are along the locks of the canal. Lock 3 Park in downtown Akron is the city's hub for entertainment. It is commonly used as an outdoor amphitheater hosting live musical entertainment, festivals and special events year-round. The park was created in the early 21st century to provide green space within the city. The Ohio and Erie Canal can still be seen flowing behind the stage where there was once a boat yard and dry dock. Later, a pottery factory stood there until the parking deck of the M. O'Neil Co. department store was built in the current location. More than 65,000 guests use the park for recreation annually. Lock 3 Live holds concerts for almost every musical genre, including alternative, R&B, reggae, gospel, country, pop, jazz and classic rock. Some festivals the park hosts throughout the year include Soap Box Derby opening ceremonies, firefighter competitions, charity events, tournaments and animal events. From November through February, Lock 3 Park is transformed into an outdoor ice-skating rink.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.ohio.com/akron-oh/venues/show/65611-lock-3-live-park |title=Lock 3 Live!

==Education==

Preschool, elementary, and secondary education is mainly provided by the [[Akron Public Schools|Akron City School District]]. Planning of the district began in 1840, when Ansel Miller suggested to build free public schools for all children in the city, paid for by property taxes. After enduring much opposition by citizens, in 1843 Miller joined with Rev. Isaac Jennings. Three years later, Jennings became the chairman of a committee of citizens who discussed how to improve the school system. On November 21, 1846, their plan was approved unanimously by the citizens. The Ohio Legislature adopted the plan, called "An act for the support and better regulation of the Common Schools of the Town of Akron" on February 8, 1847. Akron's first public schools were established in the fall of 1847 and were led by Mortimer Leggett. The first annual report showed that it cost less than $2 a year to educate a child. In 1857 the cost of running the schools for a year was $4,200 (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=4200|start_year=1857}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}). The primary schools were taught by young women, which the Akron Board of Education justified because they could be paid less and were under the supervision of a male superintendent. From 1877 to 1952, Akron graduated students semi-annually instead of annually. 9% of the city's school-aged population were born in other countries in 1888. In the 1920s, an Americanization program was designed to help the many Akron students who were first-generation Americans. Classes were in the rubber companies and some of the schools. A "continuation school" began for working boys and girls who were required by law to have at least four hours of schooling a week. In 1924, Akron's platoon schools attracted visitors from all over the country. Being a stronghold for the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during the decade, the majority of school board and government officials were members. Their influence ended with the arrival of [[Wendell Willkie]]. During the city's 1950s boom town phase, Akron schools grew eight times faster than the city's population. In 1967, Kenmore launched the Air Force JROTC. In 1971, Jennings piloted the middle school model, which moved ninth-graders to the senior high school. In 1984, all-day kindergarten was piloted at Seiberling, Rankin and Hatton schools, and Ellet, East and Garfield high schools piloted the in-school suspension program.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Airports====
[[File:Akron Fulton International Airport (36221818930).jpg|thumb|[[Akron Executive Airport]]]]
The primary terminal that airline passengers traveling to or from Akron use is the [[Akron–Canton Airport]], serving nearly 2 million passengers a year. The Akron-Canton Airport is a commercial [[airspace class|Class C]] airport located in the city of [[Green, Ohio|Green]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akroncantonairport.com/uploads/CAK_WelcomePage_FINAL.pdf |archive-date=December 9, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209090219/http://www.akroncantonairport.com/uploads/CAK_WelcomePage_FINAL.pdf |title=Welcome to the Akron-Canton Airport!}}</ref> roughly {{convert|10|mi|0|abbr=on}} southeast of Akron operated jointly by [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark]] and [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit]] counties. It serves as an alternative for travelers to or from the Cleveland area as well. [[Akron Executive Airport]] is a [[general aviation]] airport located in and owned by the City of Akron that serves private planes. It first opened in 1929 and has operated in several different capacities since then. The airport had commercial scheduled airline service until the 1950s and it is now used for both cargo and private planes.<ref name="Akron, Ohio: Akron Fulton Airport"/>
It is home of the [[Goodyear Airdock|Lockheed Martin Airdock]], where the Goodyear airships, dirigibles, and blimps were originally stored and maintained. The Goodyear blimps are now housed outside of Akron in a facility on the shores of Wingfoot Lake in nearby [[Suffield Township, Portage County, Ohio|Suffield Township]].

====Railroads====
{{main|Akron Northside station}}
[[File:Akron Northside Station.jpg|thumb|Akron Northside Station]]
Akron Northside Station is a train station at 27 Ridge Street along the [[Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad]].<ref name="Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, Akron Northside Station In Akron, Ohio - Ohio.com"/>

Because of the city's large rubber industry, Akron was once served by a variety of railroads that competed for the city's freight and passenger business. The largest were the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], [[Erie Railroad]], and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Smaller regional railroads included the [[Akron Canton and Youngstown Railroad|Akron, Canton, and Youngstown Railroad]], Northern Ohio Railway, and the Akron Barberton Belt Railroad.<ref>{{Sanders-Akron}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} Today, the city is served by [[CSX Corporation]], the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad, and their subsidiary Akron-Barberton-Cluster, which operate out of the W&LE's Akron Yard near Brittain Road on the eastern end of the city.

From 1891 to 1971 passenger service to points throughout the Midwest, as well as Washington and New York City, was provided at [[Akron Union Station]].<ref>Camp, Mark J. 'Railroad Depots of Northeast Ohio,' Arcadia Publishing, 2007, p. 27.</ref> The last legacy passenger trains were the [[Erie Lackawanna]]'s ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]]'' (ended, 1970) and the B&O's ''[[Shenandoah (B&O train)|Shenandoah]]'' (ended, 1971).<ref>{{cite web |website=Trains.com |title=Passenger trains on the eve of Amtrak |url=http://ctr.trains.com/~/media/import/files/pdf/f/7/7/passenger_trains_operating_on_the_eve_of_amtrak.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826050444/http://ctr.trains.com/~/media/import/files/pdf/f/7/7/passenger_trains_operating_on_the_eve_of_amtrak.pdf |archive-date=August 26, 2012}}</ref> There is currently no passenger rail transportation with the elimination of Amtrak's former ''[[Three Rivers (train)|Three Rivers]]'' service in 2005. The nearest [[Amtrak]] service is in [[Alliance, Ohio]] or Cleveland.

====Bus and public transportation====
[[File:AkronRTA.jpg|thumb|right|Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center]]
Public transportation is available through the [[METRO Regional Transit Authority]] system, whose fleet of over 200 buses and trolleys operates local routes and commuter buses into downtown Cleveland. [[Stark Area Regional Transit Authority]] (SARTA) also has a bus line running between [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] and Akron and the [[Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority]] (PARTA) runs an express route connecting the [[University of Akron]] with [[Kent State University]].<ref name="Akron Express"/>
Metro RTA operates out of the Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center on South Broadway Street. This facility, which opened in 2009, also houses inter-city bus transportation available through [[Greyhound Lines]].<ref name="Solar panels make Akron's new transit center a leader in Ohio"/>

====Freeways====
Akron is served by two major interstate highways that bisect the city. Unlike other cities, the bisection does not occur in the Central Business District, nor do the interstates serve downtown; rather, the [[Ohio State Route 59|Akron Innerbelt]] and to a lesser extent [[Ohio State Route 8]] serve these functions.
* [[Interstate 77]] connects [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] and [[Cleveland]], Ohio. In Akron, it has 15 interchanges, four of which permit freeway-to-freeway movements. It runs north–south in the southern part of the city to its intersection with [[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]], where it takes a westerly turn as a concurrency with Interstate 76.
* [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] connects [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]] to [[Youngstown, Ohio]], and farther. It runs east–west and has 18 interchanges in Akron, four of which are freeway-to-freeway. The East Leg was rebuilt in the 1990s to feature six lanes and longer merge lanes. The concurrency with Interstate 77 is eight lanes. The Kenmore Leg is a four-lane leg that is slightly less than two miles (3&nbsp;km) long and connects to Interstate 277.
* [[Interstate 277 (Ohio)|Interstate 277]] is an east–west spur that it forms with [[U.S. Highway 224|US 224]] after I-76 splits to the north to form the Kenmore Leg. It is six lanes and cosigned with U.S. 224.
* The [[Ohio State Route 59|Akron Innerbelt]] is a six-lane, {{convert|1.78|mi|km|adj=on}} spur from the I-76/I-77 concurrency and serves the urban core of the city. Its ramps are directional from the interstates, so it only serves west side drivers. ODOT is considering changing this design to attract more traffic to the route. The freeway comes to an abrupt end near the northern boundary of downtown where it becomes Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The freeway itself is officially known as "The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Freeway". The freeway was originally designed to connect directly to State Route 8, but plans were laid to rest in the mid-1970s because of financial troubles.
* [[Ohio State Route 8]] is an original state highway that is a limited access route that connects Akron's northern suburbs with Interstates 76 and 77. State Route 8's southern terminus is at the central interchange, where it meets I-76 and I-77. The second freeway in Akron to be completed, it went through a major overhaul in 2003 with new ramps and access roads. In 2007 ODOT began a project to upgrade the road to interstate highway standards north of Akron from [[Ohio State Route 303|State Route 303]] to I-271, providing a high speed alternative to Cleveland.<ref name="Akron Innerbelt Integration Initiative - History"/>
