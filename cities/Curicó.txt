'''Curicó''' ({{IPA|es|kuri'ko}}) is a city located in [[Chile]]'s [[Chilean Central Valley|central valley]] and serves as the capital of the [[Curicó Province]], which is part of the [[Maule Region]]. Positioned between the provinces of [[Colchagua Province|Colchagua]] and [[Talca Province|Talca]], the region stretches from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the border with [[Argentina]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Curicó|volume=7|pages=643–644}}</ref>

The city is known for its distinctive products such as cakes, fruits, cement, sugar, [[tomato sauce]], and high-quality export [[Chilean wine|wines]]. It serves as a major service hub in the central region and is considered Chile's [[Agro-Industrial Complex|agro-industrial]] capital due to its consistent economic growth.

== Etymology ==
''Curicó'' means "black waters" in [[Mapuche language|Mapudungun]], originally meaning "land of black water".<ref name=":0" />

== Coat of arms ==
The city's symbol is a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] emblem representing the esteemed civic traditions of Curicó's early [[Conquest of Chile|Spanish settlers]]. It features a silver knight on a black horse, set against a green field, slaying a golden serpent. The lower part carries the phrase "Noble and Loyal Villa de San José de Buenavista de Curicó," while the upper part displays a golden mural crown.

This coat of arms is a modification of the emblem of field marshal Lorenzo de Labra y Corvalán de Castilla, the landowner where the city's original and modern structures were erected. The Spanish colony was on the verge of adopting this symbol when the [[Chilean War of Independence|War of Independence]] broke out.

Ahead of Curicó's bicentennial, the Spanish community conducted a thorough study and successfully recovered the [[coat of arms]], whose model is housed in the [[Chilean National Museum of Natural History|National Historical Museum]] in [[Santiago]]. On 2 September 1943, a month before the city's anniversary, the municipal council, led by Mayor Carlos Castro, officially declared this coat of arms as the city's emblem.

The coat of arms of the Curicó commune is used in internal and public ceremonies involving the Curicó Municipality. It is also utilized in public events organized by city institutions. Additionally, it serves as an essential element in all official documentation of the municipality, as well as in seals and stamps of the corporation.

== History ==
[[Image:Curico_in_1901.png|250px|thumb|left|The central square of Curico in 1901, the most famous image of Curico.]]

The city of Curicó was originally inhabited by the indigenous Curis ("black"), named after the color of their lands near streams and wetlands.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Cervantes |first=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de |title=Historia de Curicó |url=https://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/historia-de-curico--0/html/ff917b2e-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_6.html |access-date=2024-01-20 |website=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes |language=es}}</ref>

Founded as San José de Buena Vista de Curicó on 9 October 1743, through donations from residents like Captain Pedro Nolasco Solorza and Mónica Donoso y Navarro, widow of Labra, under the authorization of [[José Manso de Velasco, 1st Count of Superunda|José Antonio Manso de Velasco]], [[Royal Governor of Chile|governor of Chile]] and later [[List of viceroys of Peru|viceroy of Peru]].

In 1747, Governor [[Domingo Ortiz de Rosas, 1st Marquis of Poblaciones|Domingo Ortiz de Rozas]] relocated the city 3 kilometers east due to excessive humidity. However, it didn't thrive until after the 1751 earthquake forced the inhabitants of the old town to move.

Despite its strategic location, the city struggled with a small population and conservative influences from local convents and aristocratic families.

The oldest and most valuable building of the city is ''La Iglesia San Francisco'' ("San Francisco's Church"), built in 1734, and came to its current location in 1759.

Curicó gained city status in 1830. [[Luis Cruz Martínez]], a Chilean military figure, is celebrated as the city's hero, and Curicó serves as a central hub for communication, commerce, and the economy of nearby agro-industries.

The [[2010 Chile earthquake|2010 Chilean Earthquake]] heavily impacted Curicó, causing the collapse of the historic district where sixty percent of houses and ninety percent of the district remain unreconstructed. Examples include the phased inauguration of the San José de Curicó Hospital.

Curicó is known for its strong local identity, fostered by a good neighborhood atmosphere, hero Luis Cruz Martínez, and its football club.

==Geography==
Curicó is on the Guaiquillo River, {{convert|183|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] along the route of the [[Transportation in Chile#Railways|Chilean Central Railway]]. The city is situated in the fertile [[Chilean Central Valley]], {{convert|228|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level, in the midst of a comparatively well-cultivated region.<ref name="EB1911" /> The eastern and western sides are mountainous, separated by the Chilean Central Valley. A volcano called [[Descabezado Grande]] can be seen from most parts at a distance of eighty kilometers. The commune spans an area of{{convert|1328.4|sqkm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="INE" />

The main rivers are the [[Lontué River]] and [[Teno River]], which surround the city. The landscape is dominated by the [[Andes Mountains|Andes]] and [[Chilean Coastal Range]].

== Climate ==
Curicó has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csb''), relatively hot dry [[summer]]s (November to March) with temperatures reaching {{convert|32|C}} on the hottest days. [[Winter]]s (June to August) are more humid, with typical maximum daily temperatures of {{convert|15|C}}. Mean rainfall is {{convert|855.98|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year.  In August 2007, Curicó experienced snowfall for the first time in over 60 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In the southern part of the valley the climate is more temperate and rainfall more abundant; the effects of this are to be seen in better [[pasturage]]. [[Irrigation]] is used to a large extent.<ref name="EB1911"/>
