==History==
[[File:Province de Bac-Ninh (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bac Ninh province in 1909]]
During the [[Hồng Bàng dynasty|Hồng Bàng period]], Bắc Ninh belonged to bộ Vũ Ninh (bộ is at a local level the highest administrative unit under the dynasties of the [[Hùng king]]s). Under the [[Lý dynasty|Lý]] and [[Trần dynasty|Trần]] dynasties, it belonged to lộ Bắc Ninh; it belonged to thừa tuyên Kinh Bắc under the [[Lê dynasty]] and then changed into trấn Kinh Bắc and Bắc Ninh. Under Emperor [[Minh Mạng]] of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]], it was renamed Bắc Ninh province in 1831.

During the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], Bắc Ninh province and the neighboring [[Bắc Giang province]] were united as [[Hà Bắc province]] on 27 October 1962. During the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]], on 6 November 1996 at the 10th Session of the 9th National Congress, Hà Bắc province was separated into two provinces, Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang. The administrative system of Bắc Ninh province has operated since 1 January 1997.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Bắc Ninh has a rather even and flat terrain, mainly sloping from north to south and west to east, causing currents to flow down into the Đuống and Thái Bình Rivers. Field areas are 3-7m high and hill and mountain areas are 300-400m high above sea level. Its hills and mountains only make up 0.53 per cent of its natural area, mainly in the two districts of [[Quế Võ District|Quế Võ]] and [[Tiên Du District|Tiên Du]]. Also, there are shallow depressions along dykes under the districts of Gia Bình, Lương Tài, Quế Võ and Yên Phong.

===Natural resources===
The province's total natural land area is 822.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, in which agricultural land, forestry land, specialized and residential land and unused land account for 54%, 0.7%, 31% and 14.3% respectively. The province's mineral reserve is limited: mainly construction materials such as clay in Quế Võ and Tiên Du, sandstone in Thị Cầu, Vũ Ninh, Bắc Ninh town and peat in Yên Phong.

=== Climate ===
Bắc Ninh features a warm [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') with plentiful precipitation. Bắc Ninh is located in a tropical monsoon region. The annual average temperature is 24&nbsp;°C. The highest is 30&nbsp;°C in July; the lowest is 6&nbsp;°C in January. The province experiences the typical climate of northern Vietnam, where summers are hot and humid, and winters are, by national standards, relatively cold and dry. Summers, lasting from May to September, are hot and humid, receiving the majority of the annual {{convert|1680|mm|1}} of rainfall. The winters, lasting from November to March, are relatively mild, dry (in the first half) or humid (in the second half), while spring (April) can bring light rains. Autumn (October) is the best time of the year in terms of weather. The average annual sunshine is 1,530-1,776 hours, while the relative humidity is 79%.<ref>http://www.greentrailtours.com.vn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=710:bac-ninh-climate&catid=34:need-to-know&Itemid=29 {{dead link|date=June 2018}}</ref>

Bắc Ninh is the smallest of all Vietnamese provinces by area (and is smaller than any of the five province-level municipalities). However, it is home to a relatively large number of people for its size, having the highest population density of any province. On average, there are over 1,200 people for every square kilometre of land in Bắc Ninh.

According to the census of 1 April 2019, the population was 1,368,840<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-11-02 |title=Tổng kết Tổng điều tra dân số và nhà ở năm 2019 |url=https://bacninh.gov.vn/news/-/details/20182/tong-ket-tong-ieu-tra-dan-so-va-nha-o-nam-2019 |access-date=2024-11-02 |website=Cổng thông tin điện tử tỉnh Bắc Ninh |language=vi-VN}}</ref> with a density of 1,664 people/km<sup>2</sup>, 6 times the national average.

==Transport==
[[File:Quoclo1Amoi.JPG|thumb|left|220px|1A Highway]] 
Bắc Ninh is situated about 30 kilometres from Hanoi and Nội Bài International Airport, and some 100&nbsp;km from Haiphong, Hạ Long, Cái Lân Port and Lạng Sơn border gate.
* Roadway: The province has over 3,906.8&nbsp;km of road, 104.8 km of which are from 4 routes of [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|national roads of No. 1]] (old and new routes) (linking Hanoi – Bắc Ninh – Lạng Sơn), No. 18 (Nội Bài – Bắc Ninh – Hạ Long), No. 38 (Bắc Ninh – Hải Dương – Haiphong) and the Nội Bài-Hạ Long Expressway. 251 km are from routes of provincial roads, 404 km from district and urban areas, and some 3,147 km from commune and hamlet roads.
*Waterway: Three big rivers flowing through Bắc Ninh comprise the Cầu River which is 42 km long, Thái Bình River which is 17 km long, and Đuống River which is 42 km long. Also, there is Đáp Cầu Port, and two special ports of the Cầu River.
*Railway: A 20-km Hanoi-Lang Son Rail Route runs through Bắc Ninh and 4 railway stations of Từ Sơn, Lim, Bắc Ninh, and Thị Cầu. A 39-km Yên Viên-Phả Lại Rail Route is planned to be constructed in the districts of Tiên Du, Từ Sơn, Quế Võ and Bắc Ninh City.
*Power supply: Power is stably supplied for production and domestic consumption, comprising 120 km of 110kV national grid, 249.3 km of 35-kV electric lines and 3,700 km of 0.4kV electric lines. All districts and cities have national grid and all households use electricity.

==Economy==
[[File:Tranh Đông Hồ - Cá chép.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Dong Ho style print]]
Bắc Ninh province lies on the major traffic artery linking Vietnam and China – which is a strongly growing market and expected to be larger as the China - ASEAN free trade area is formed. It also lies on the Nanning - Lạng Sơn - Hanoi - Hai Phong and Nanning - Singapore economic corridors, the Hanoi capital city planning area and the busy Hanoi - Hai Phong - Quảng Ninh economic development triangle.

Bắc Ninh province is known as a light point in industrial development, and has been lifting rapidly with long steps of industrialisation – modernisation.
Bắc Ninh has 15 [[industrial park]]s with a total area of 7,681 ha, of which nine have operated effectively. The [[industrial park]]s have lured 272 [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) projects totaling to over $3.7 billion, including those invested by [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Samsung]], P&Tel, [[Sumitomo Group|Sumitomo]],  [[Foxconn]], [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Orion Confectionery|Orion]], [[PepsiCo]] and [[Nokia]]. They have attracted 254 domestic projects with a total registered capital of over $1 billion and a labour force of more than 83,000. Bắc Ninh has as many as 120 handicraft-producing villages, 62 of which are involved in producing traditional products such as copper casting (Đại Bái-Gia Bình), iron and steel (Đa Hội-Từ Sơn), and wooden products (Đồng Kỵ-Kim Sơn). They have the upper hand and high potential to contribute to Bắc Ninh's economic development.

In 2015, the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) increased 8.7% compared with 2014. The economic structure shifted in the right direction with agro-forestry-fishery accounting for 5.3%, industry and construction for 75.6% and service 19.1%. Industrial production value was estimated at VND 610 trillion, up 9.1%. The total retail sale of goods and consumer service revenue reached over VND 39.7 trillion, up 15.4%, the total export turnover of goods was estimated at US$23.2 billion, up 6.4%, the total state budget revenue in the province was estimated at VND 14,500 billion, up 14.3%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deputy Prime Minister Vu Van Ninh works in Bac Ninh|url=http://duphong.bacninh.gov.vn/en-us/noidung/new/Pages/socio.aspx?ItemID=908|access-date=28 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106184030/http://duphong.bacninh.gov.vn/en-us/noidung/new/Pages/socio.aspx?ItemID=908|archive-date=6 January 2016}}</ref>

[[Hồ chicken|Hồ chicken (gà Hồ)]] is a breed originating in Bắc Ninh Province. Gà Hồ is a distinctly Vietnamese rare breed of chicken, familiar as a symbol in Vietnam. According to folklore, the chicken (particularly the roosters) have the five qualities of a man of honour: literacy, martial arts, physical strength, humanity and loyalty. The Gà Hồ rooster rising himself to welcome the sun is used as a symbol for the '''3rd [[Asian Indoor Games]]''', which were held in [[Vietnam]] from 30 October till 8 November 2009. The symbolism in the context of the [[2009 Asian Indoor Games|AIGs]] is that the rising rooster is linked to the readiness of the sports industry of Vietnam to host this major event.
