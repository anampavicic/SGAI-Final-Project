==History==
The area around Kamagaya has been inhabited since prehistory, and archaeologists have found [[Jōmon period]] [[shell midden]]s in the area.<ref name="nipponika">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) |title=Kamagaya-shi (鎌ヶ谷市) |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-05-09 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> During the [[Kamakura period]], the area was controlled by the [[Sōma clan]]. Kamagaya flourished in the [[Edo period]]  1603–1868 when the area was largely ''[[tenryō]]'' territory within [[Shimōsa Province]] controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. One part of present-day Kamagaya was part of the Kogane Ranch, which raised war horses for the army of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. In the Edo period Kamagaya was also a thriving ''[[shukuba]]'' post on the Kioroshi Road, which connected present-day [[Inzai, Chiba|Inzai]] on the [[Tone River]] to [[Edogawa-ku]] in Tokyo. The road was utilized to bring fresh fish and other marine products from the Tone River region to the capital Edo.<ref name="kokugo">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (日本国語大辞典) |title=Kamagaya-shi (鎌ヶ谷市) |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-02-28 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> After the [[Meiji Restoration]], it became part of Chiba Prefecture. Kamagaya Village was one of several villages created on April 1, 1889 under [[Inba District, Chiba|Inba District]] with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. In 1945, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] appropriated the former Musashino Country Club, turning the [[golf course]] into an [[air field]]. The base was turned over to the [[United States Air Force]] after World War II, becoming Shiroi Air Base, and was transferred to the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] in 1959, becoming [[Shimofusa Air Base|JMSDF Shimofusa Air Base]]. Kamagaya became a town on August 1, 1968, and was elevated to city status on September 1, 1971.

==Government==
Kamagaya has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Kamagaya contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Chiba 13th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Kamagaya, formerly a farming area, is now a regional commercial center. Due to its numerous train connections it serves as a transportation hub and [[bedroom community]] for nearby [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]] and [[Tokyo]]. Kamagaya's trademark produce is the round, [[Pyrus pyrifolia|Nashi Pear]], and there are many pear [[orchard]]s dotted about the city, whose white blossoms open toward the end of the [[cherry blossom]] season.<ref name="enc"/>
