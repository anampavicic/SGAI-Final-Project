'''Sudbury''', officially the '''City of Greater Sudbury''', is the largest city in [[Northern Ontario]] by population, with a population of 166,004 at the [[2021 Canadian Census]].<ref name="Census">{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&SearchText=Sudbury&DGUIDlist=2021A00053553005&GENDERlist=1&STATISTIClist=1&HEADERlist=0 |title= Census Profile, 2021 Census of Population Data table: City of Greater Sudbury |date= February 9, 2022 |publisher=Statistics Canada |access-date=February 10, 2022}}</ref> By land area, it is the largest in Ontario and the [[List of the largest cities and towns in Canada by area|fifth largest in Canada]]. It is administratively a [[List of census divisions of Ontario#Single-tier municipalities|single-tier municipality]] and thus is not part of any district, county, or [[regional municipality]]. The City of Greater Sudbury is separate from, but entirely surrounded by the [[Sudbury District]]. The city is also referred to as "'''''Ville du {{lang|fr|Grand Sudbury}}'''''"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Contact the City |url=https://www.greatersudbury.ca/city-hall/contact-the-city/ |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=www.greatersudbury.ca}}</ref> among [[Franco-Ontarian|Francophones]].

The Sudbury region was inhabited by the [[Ojibwe]] people of the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin group]] for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury after the discovery of [[nickel]] and [[copper]] ore in 1883 during the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greatersudbury.ca/live/about-greater-sudbury/history/ |title=History - Greater Sudbury |publisher=Greatersudbury.ca |date=2001-01-01 |access-date=2017-07-26}}</ref> Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] with several previously unincorporated townships. Being located inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal, with average January lows of around {{convert|-18|C|0}} and average July highs of {{convert|25|C|0}}.<ref name="EnvironmentCanada" />

The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical [[smelting]] activity. Sudbury was once a major lumber center and a world leader in nickel mining. Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century. The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco, now [[Vale Limited]], which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s, and [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge]], now [[Glencore]]. Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail, economic, health, and educational center for Northeastern Ontario. Sudbury is also home to a large [[Franco-Ontarian]] population, which influences its arts and culture.

==Toponymy==
James Worthington, the superintendent of construction on the Northern Ontario segment of the railway, selected the name Sudbury after [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], in England, which was the hometown of his wife Caroline Hitchcock.<ref name="canadianencyclopedia" /><ref>Thomas, Ray and Pearsall, Kathy (1994). ''Sudbury''. Boston Mills Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55046-110-7}}.</ref>

The city's official name was changed to Greater Sudbury in 2001, when it was amalgamated with its suburban towns into the current city, on the grounds of ensuring that the merger did not erase the longstanding community identities of the outlying towns.<ref>Louise Surette, "Three new megacities proposed: Sudbury to be super city of Northeastern Ontario". ''[[North Bay Nugget]]'', November 27, 1999.</ref> In everyday usage, however, the city is still more commonly referred to as just Sudbury.

==History==

The American inventor [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Sudbury area as a prospector in 1901. He is credited with the original discovery of the ore body at [[Nickel Centre#Falconbridge|Falconbridge]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&lang=en&currID=2031&parID=2029 |title=Thomas Edison |website= Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums |publisher=City of Greater Sudbury |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> Rich deposits of [[Millerite|nickel sulphide]] ore were discovered in the [[Sudbury Basin]] geological formation. The construction of the railway allowed exploitation of these mineral resources and shipment of the commodities to markets and ports, as well as large-scale lumber extraction.<ref name=railtown />

Mining began to replace lumber as the primary industry as the area's transportation network was improved to include trams. These enabled workers to live in one community and work in another.<ref name=railtown /> Sudbury's economy was dominated by the mining industry for much of the 20th century. Two major mining companies were created: [[Vale Limited|Inco]] in 1902 and [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge]] in 1928. They became two of the city's major employers and two of the world's leading producers of nickel.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Through the decades that followed, Sudbury's economy went through boom and bust cycles as world demand for nickel fluctuated. Demand was high during the [[World War I|First World War]], when Sudbury-mined nickel was used extensively in the manufacturing of artillery in [[Sheffield]], England. It bottomed out when the war ended and then rose again in the mid-1920s as peacetime uses for nickel began to develop. The town was reincorporated as a city in 1930.

The city recovered from the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]] much more quickly than almost any other city in North America due to increased demand for nickel in the 1930s. Sudbury was the fastest-growing city and one of the wealthiest cities in Canada for most of the decade. Many of the city's social problems in the Great Depression era were not caused by unemployment or poverty, but due to the difficulty in keeping up with all of the new infrastructure demands created by rapid growth — for example, employed mineworkers sometimes ended up living in [[boarding house]]s or makeshift [[shanty town]]s, because demand for new housing was rising faster than supply.<ref name=railtown /> Between 1936 and 1941, the city was ordered into [[receivership]] by the [[Ontario Municipal Board]].<ref name=railtown /> Another economic slowdown affected the city in 1937, but the city's fortunes rose again with wartime demands during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The [[Frood Mine]] alone accounted for 40 percent of all the nickel used in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[artillery]] production during the war. After the end of the war, Sudbury was in a good position to supply nickel to the United States government when it decided to stockpile non-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] supplies during the [[Cold War]].<ref name=railtown />

The open coke beds used in the early to mid-20th century and logging for fuel resulted in a near-total loss of native vegetation in the area. Consequently, the terrain was made up of exposed rocky outcrops permanently stained charcoal black by the air pollution from the roasting yards. [[Acid rain]] added more staining, in a layer that penetrates up to {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} into the once pink-grey [[granite]].{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

The construction of the [[Inco Superstack]] in 1972 dispersed sulphuric acid through the air over a much wider area, reducing the acidity of local precipitation. This enabled the municipality, province and Inco and academics from [[Laurentian University]] to begin an environmental recovery program in the late 1970s, labelled a "regreening" effort. [[Calcium oxide|Lime]] was spread over the charred soil by hand and by aircraft. Seeds of wild [[Poaceae|grasses]] and other vegetation were also spread. As of 2010, 9.2&nbsp;million new trees have been planted in the city.<ref>[http://www.greatersudbury.ca/content/div_landreclamation/documents/2010%20Final%20Annual%20Report.pdf Annual Report 2010], Page 4, City of Greater Sudbury Land Reclamation Program.</ref> [[Vale Limited|Vale]] has begun to rehabilitate the [[Spoil tip|slag heap]]s that surrounds their smelter in the Copper Cliff area with the planting of grass and trees,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatersudbury.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_earthcare&lang=en&currID=6855 |title=Vale Community-based Initiatives |publisher=The City of Greater Sudbury |access-date=2012-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811013206/http://www.greatersudbury.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_earthcare&lang=en&currID=6855 |archive-date=August 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as well as the use of [[biosolids]] to stabilize and regreen [[tailings]] areas.<ref>[https://www.northernontariobusiness.com/regional-news/sudbury/biosolids-rejuvenate-mining-wasteland-983489 "Biosolids rejuvenate mining wasteland"].

In 1978, the workers of Sudbury's largest mining corporation, Inco (now Vale), [[1978 INCO strike|embarked on a strike]] over production and employment cutbacks. The strike, which lasted for nine months, badly damaged Sudbury's economy. The city government was spurred to launch a project to diversify the city's economy.

A unique and visionary project, [[Science North]] was inaugurated in 1984 with two-snowflake styled buildings connected by a tunnel through the [[Canadian shield]] where the [[Creighton fault]] intersects the shores of [[Lake Ramsey]].<ref name="pearson85">{{cite journal |doi=10.1139/t85-064|title=Rock engineering for construction of Science North, Sudbury, Ontario|year=1985|last1=Franklin|first1=John A.|last2=Pearson|first2=David|journal=Canadian Geotechnical Journal|volume=22|issue=4|pages=443–455}}</ref> The city tried to attract new employers and industries through the 1980s and 1990s with mixed success.<ref name=railtown /> The city of Sudbury and its suburban communities, which were reorganized into the [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 1973, was subsequently merged in 2001 into the single-tier city of Greater Sudbury.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In 2006, both of the city's major mining companies, Canadian-based Inco and Falconbridge, were taken over by new owners: Inco was acquired by the Brazilian company CVRD (now renamed [[Vale (company)|Vale]]), while Falconbridge was purchased by the Swiss company [[Xstrata]], which itself was purchased by Anglo–Swiss Glencore, forming [[Glencore|Glencore Xstrata]].

The ecology of the Sudbury region has recovered dramatically, helped by regreening programs and improved mining practices. The [[United Nations]] honoured twelve cities in the world, including Sudbury, with the Local Government Honours Award at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] to recognise the city's community-based environmental reclamation strategies. By 2010, the regreening programs had successfully rehabilitated {{convert|3,350|ha|abbr=on}} of land in the city; however, approximately {{convert|30,000|ha|abbr=on}} of land have yet to be rehabilitated.<ref>{{cite news |title=Regreening: 3,350 hectares done, but 30,000 hectares to go|author= Bill Bradley |url=http://www.northernlife.ca/news/localNews/2010/01/regreening260110.aspx |newspaper=[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]]|date= Jan 25, 2010|access-date=17 December 2012}}</ref>

Various studies have confirmed that the provincial government's initial claims that the municipal amalgamation would result in cost savings and increased efficiencies have not borne out, and in fact administration of the amalgamated city costs significantly more than the prior regional government structure did.<ref>Ben Leeson, "City of Greater Sudbury must 'die' -- professor".

==Geography==
{{See also|List of lakes in Greater Sudbury}}
Sudbury has 330 lakes over {{convert|10|ha|abbr=on}} in size within the city limits.<ref name="grandsudbury.ca">{{cite web |url=http://www.grandsudbury.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_lakewaterquality&lang=en&currID=688 |title=City of Lakes |author= City of Sudbury |year=2013|publisher= City of Sudbury |access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref> The most prominent is [[Lake Wanapitei]], the largest lake in the world completely contained within the boundaries of a single city. [[Ramsey Lake]], a few kilometres south of downtown Sudbury, held the same record before the municipal amalgamation in 2001 brought Lake Wanapitei fully inside the city limits.<ref name="grandsudbury.ca"/> Sudbury is divided into two main watersheds: to the east is the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]] watershed which flows into [[Georgian Bay]] and to the west is the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] watershed which flows into the [[North Channel (Ontario)|North Channel]] of [[Lake Huron]].<ref name="grandsudbury.ca"/>

Sudbury is built around many small, rocky mountains with exposed [[igneous rock]] of the [[Canadian Shield|Canadian (Precambrian) Shield]]. The ore deposits in Sudbury are part of a large geological structure known as the [[Sudbury Basin]], which are the remnants of a nearly two billion-year-old [[impact crater]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Mountain of a meteor hit ancient Sudbury|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=7ef9efbc-7937-4102-a6a1-21245c546ea5|publisher=The Ottawa Citizen|date=30 August 2007|access-date=8 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321062745/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=7ef9efbc-7937-4102-a6a1-21245c546ea5|archive-date=March 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> long thought to be the result of a [[meteorite]] collision, more recent analysis has suggested that the crater may in fact have been created by a [[comet]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/sudbury-basin-comet-impact-crater_n_6168408.html "Canada's Vast 'Sudbury Basin' Was Created By Comet, Study Says"].

Sudbury's [[pentlandite]], [[pyrite]] and [[pyrrhotite]] ores contain profitable amounts of many elements—primarily nickel and copper, but also platinum, palladium and other valuable metals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/004467.html|title=About Ontario|website=Ontario.ca|access-date=21 October 2017|archive-date=November 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103034745/http://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/004467.html?|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Local smelting of the ore releases this sulphur into the atmosphere where it combines with water vapour to form [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]], contributing to [[acid rain]]. As a result, Sudbury has had a widespread reputation as a wasteland.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9609/12/greening.sudbury/ | work=CNN | title=Canadian wasteland gets green makeover}}</ref> In parts of the city, vegetation was devastated by acid rain and logging to provide fuel for early [[smelting]] techniques. To a lesser extent, the area's ecology was also impacted by [[lumber camp]]s in the area providing wood for the reconstruction of Chicago after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. While other logging areas in Northeastern Ontario were also involved in that effort, the emergence of mining-related processes in the following decade made it significantly harder for new trees to grow to full maturity in the Sudbury area than elsewhere.<ref name=railtown />
[[File:Blackened rocks in Sudbury, Ontario.JPG|thumb|Erosion has resulted in [[bedrock]] being exposed in many parts of the city, many of which were charred to a pitted, dark black appearance.]]
The resulting erosion exposed [[bedrock]] in many parts of the city, which was charred in most places to a pitted, dark black appearance. There was not a complete lack of vegetation in the region as [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] and wild [[blueberry]] patches thrived in the acidic soils. During the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] crewed lunar exploration program, [[NASA]] astronauts trained in Sudbury to become familiar with impact [[breccia]] and [[shatter cone]]s, rare rock formations produced by large meteorite impacts. However, the popular misconception that they were visiting Sudbury because it purportedly resembled the lifeless surface of the [[Moon]] persists.<ref>[http://castroller.com/podcasts/TheCurrent/1325020 "A Mining Town"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708123819/http://castroller.com/podcasts/TheCurrent/1325020 |date=July 8, 2011 }}.

The city's [[Nickel District Conservation Authority]] operates a [[Protected area|conservation area]], the [[Lake Laurentian Conservation Area]], in the city's south end. Other unique environmental projects in the city include the Fielding Bird Sanctuary, a protected area along [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway 17]] near [[Walden, Ontario#Lively|Lively]] that provides a managed natural habitat for birds, and a hiking and nature trail near [[Nickel Centre#Coniston|Coniston]], which is named in honour of scientist [[Jane Goodall]].<ref name="sudbury">{{cite web|url=http://www.city.greatersudbury.on.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_landreclamation&lang=en&currID=1036|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110728060209/http://www.city.greatersudbury.on.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_landreclamation&lang=en&currID=1036|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 28, 2011|title=City of Greater Sudbury|date=July 28, 2011|access-date=April 9, 2017}}</ref>

===Climate===

Greater Sudbury has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Dfb''). This region has warm and often humid summers with occasional short lasting periods of hot weather, with long, cold and snowy winters. It is situated north of the [[Great Lakes]], making it prone to arctic air masses. Monthly precipitation is equal year round, with snow cover expected for up to six months of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=4132&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=sudbury&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000 Station Data - Climate - Environment and Climate Change Canada|first=Environment and Climate Change|last=Canada|website=climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca|access-date=August 31, 2011|archive-date=November 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111195155/http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=4132&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=sudbury&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although extreme weather events are rare, [[Sudbury tornado|one of the worst tornadoes]] in Canadian history struck the city and its suburbs on August 20, 1970, killing six people, injuring two hundred, and causing more than [[Canadian dollar|C$]]17 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|CA|17|1970}} million in {{Inflation/year|CA}}) in damages.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/environment/extreme-weather/extreme-weather-general/freak-tornado-kills-six-in-sudbury.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=CBC Digital Archives|access-date= August 27, 2013}}</ref>

The city is divided between the federal electoral districts of [[Sudbury (federal electoral district)|Sudbury]] and [[Nickel Belt (federal electoral district)|Nickel Belt]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], and the provincial electoral districts of [[Sudbury (provincial electoral district)|Sudbury]] and [[Nickel Belt (provincial electoral district)|Nickel Belt]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. The federal and provincial districts do not have identical boundaries despite using the same names; most notably, the [[Walden, Ontario|Walden]] district of the city is located in Sudbury federally but in Nickel Belt provincially. The city is represented federally by Members of Parliament [[Viviane Lapointe]] and [[Marc Serré]], both of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and provincially by [[Jamie West]] and [[France Gélinas]] of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]]. The provincial [[Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines]] has its head office in the city.

Both federal and provincial politics in the city tend to be dominated by the Liberal and New Democratic parties. Historically, the Liberals have been stronger in the Sudbury riding, with the New Democrats dominant in Nickel Belt, although both ridings have elected members of both parties at different times.

=== Utilities ===
'''Greater Sudbury Utilities Inc.''' (GSU) delivers utility services in the city's urban core. Its sole shareholder is the City of Greater Sudbury.

==Communities==
{{See also| Urban neighbourhoods of Sudbury }}
The city of Sudbury and its suburban communities were reorganized into the [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 1973, which was subsequently merged in 2001 into the single-tier city of Greater Sudbury.

In common usage, the city's urban core is still generally referred to as ''Sudbury'', while the outlying former towns are still referred to by their old names and continue in some respects to maintain their own distinct community identities despite their lack of political independence. Each of the seven former municipalities in turn encompasses numerous smaller neighbourhoods. Amalgamated cities (2001 Canadian census population) include: '''Sudbury''' (85,354)<ref name="www12.statcan.ca"/> and [[Valley East]] (22,374).<ref>{{cite web | last =Statistics Canada | title =2001 Community Profile of Valley East | year =2001 | url =http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553028&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=valley%20east&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | access-date =2012-07-01 | archive-date =October 18, 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151018091620/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553028&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=valley%20east&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | url-status =dead }}</ref> Towns (2001 Canadian census population) include: [[Rayside-Balfour]] (15,046),<ref>{{cite web | last =Statistics Canada | title =2001 Community Profile of Rayside-Balfour | year =2001 | url =http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553024&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=rayside-balfour&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | access-date =2012-07-01 | archive-date =October 18, 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151018091620/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553024&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=rayside-balfour&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | url-status =dead }}</ref> [[Nickel Centre]] (12,672),<ref>{{cite web | last =Statistics Canada | title =2001 Community Profile of Nickel Centre | year =2001 | url =http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553001&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Nickel%20Centre&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | access-date =2012-07-01 | archive-date =October 18, 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151018091620/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553001&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Nickel%20Centre&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | url-status =dead }}</ref> [[Walden, Ontario|Walden]] (10,101),<ref>{{cite web | last =Statistics Canada | title =2001 Community Profile of Walden | year =2001 | url =http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553012&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=walden&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | access-date =2012-07-01 | archive-date =October 18, 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151018091620/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553012&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=walden&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | url-status =dead }}</ref> [[Onaping Falls]] (4,887),<ref>{{cite web | last =Statistics Canada | title =2001 Community Profile of Onaping Falls | year =2001 | url =http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553019&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=onaping%20falls&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | access-date =2012-07-01 | archive-date =October 18, 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151018091620/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553019&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=onaping%20falls&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | url-status =dead }}</ref> and [[Capreol]] (3,486).<ref>{{cite web | last =Statistics Canada | title =2001 Community Profile of Capreol | year =2001 | url =http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553035&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=capreol&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | access-date =2012-07-01 | archive-date =October 18, 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151018091620/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3553035&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=capreol&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | url-status =dead }}</ref> The [[Wanup]] area, formerly an unincorporated settlement outside of Sudbury's old city limits, was also annexed into the city in 2001, along with a large wilderness area on the northeastern shore of [[Lake Wanapitei]].

==Culture==
Sudbury's culture is influenced by the large [[Franco-Ontarian]] community consisting of approximately 40 percent of the city's population,<ref name=2011NHS /> particularly in the amalgamated municipalities of [[Valley East]] and [[Rayside-Balfour]] and historically in the [[Urban neighbourhoods of Sudbury#Flour Mill|Moulin-à-Fleur]] neighbourhood. The French culture is celebrated with the [[Franco-Ontarian flag]], recognized by the province as an official emblem, which was created in 1975 by a group of teachers at [[Laurentian University]] and after some controversy has flown at [[Tom Davies Square]] since 2006. The large francophone community plays a central role in developing and maintaining many of the cultural institutions of Sudbury including the [[Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario]], [[La Nuit sur l'étang]], [[La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario]], [[Le Centre franco-ontarien de folklore]] and the [[Prise de parole]] publishing company. The city hosted Les Jeux de la francophonie canadienne in 2011.

===Arts===
[[File:ArtGallerySudburyBelrockMansion.jpg|thumb|The [[Art Gallery of Sudbury]] was founded in 1967, and is one of two [[art galleries]] located in the city.]]
The [[Sudbury Arts Council]] was established in 1974. Its mandate is to connect, communicate and celebrate the arts.<ref>[http://www.thesudburystar.com/2014/03/12/mayor-introduces-new-sudbury-art-event "Mayor introduces new Sudbury art event"]. ''[[Sudbury Star]]'', March 12, 2014.</ref> It has an important role to provide a calendar of events and news about arts and culture activities. The city is home to two art galleries—the [[Art Gallery of Sudbury]] and [[La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario]]. Both are dedicated primarily to Canadian art, especially artists from Northern Ontario.

The city's only professional theatre company is the francophone [[Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario]] (TNO), one of seven organizations residing at the [[Place des Arts (Sudbury)|Place des Arts]], where it also stages its performances. The [[Sudbury Theatre Centre]], which was the city's only professional English-language theatre company, merged with [[YES Theatre]] in 2023, though the building which was previously home to the company retains its original name.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ulrichsen |first=Heidi |date=November 9, 2023 |title=YES Theatre, Sudbury Theatre Centre have officially merged |url=https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/yes-theatre-sudbury-theatre-centre-have-officially-merged-7810830 |work=Sudbury.com}}</ref> Theatrical productions are also staged by several community theatre groups, as well as by high school drama students at [[Sudbury Secondary School]], [[Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School]], [[St. Charles College (Sudbury)|St. Charles College]] and [[École secondaire Macdonald-Cartier]] with its troupe Les Draveurs. Postsecondary institutions in the city no longer offer training in theatre, following the closures of Theatre programs at [[Thorneloe University]] in 2020<ref>{{Cite news |date=May 2, 2020 |title=Thorneloe University to shut down Theatre Arts and Motion Picture Arts programs |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/theatre-arts-motion-picture-film-thorneloe-financial-deficit-1.5553289 |work=CBC Sudbury}}</ref> and [[Laurentian University]] in 2021,<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 9, 2021 |title=Laurentian University cuts 100 professors, dozens of programs |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/laurentian-negotiations-insolvency-terminations-restructuring-1.5982114 |work=CBC Sudbury}}</ref> as well as the technical production programs at [[Collège Boréal]] and [[Cambrian College]].

After a brief period as a lumber camp, Sudbury's economy was dominated by the mining industry for much of the 20th century. By the 1970s, Inco employed a quarter of the local workforce.<ref name=restive>[https://www.thestar.com/business/article/740849--in-sudbury-it-s-restive-not-festive "In Sudbury it's restive, not festive"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', December 19, 2009.</ref> However, in 2006, Inco and Falconbridge were taken over by foreign multinational corporations: Inco was acquired by the Brazilian company [[Vale (company)|Vale]], and Falconbridge was purchased by the Swiss company [[Xstrata]] which was in turn purchased by Anglo–Swiss Glencore forming [[Glencore|Glencore Xstrata]]. Several other mining companies, including First Nickel and [[KGHM Polska Miedź|KGHM]], also have mining operations in the Sudbury area.

Mining now employs only 6,000 people in the city, although the mining supply and service sector employs a further 10,000.<ref name="PricewaterhouseCoopers"/> By 2006, 80% of Greater Sudbury's labour force was employed in services with 20% remaining in manufacturing.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Over 345 mining supply and service companies are located in Sudbury.<ref>[http://www.republicofmining.com/2008/06/06/sudbury-north-bay-supply-corridor-growing-dick-destefano/#more-274 "Sudbury-North Bay mining supply corridor growing"].

While mining has decreased in relative importance, Sudbury's economy has diversified to establish itself as a major centre of finance, business, tourism, health care, education, government, and science and technology research.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/004664.html |title=Greater Sudbury |access-date=2017-08-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414183749/http://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/004664.html |archive-date=April 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Many of these reflect Sudbury's position as a regional service center for [[Northeastern Ontario]], a market of 550,000 people.<ref name="PricewaterhouseCoopers"/>

Many retail businesses in the city have moved outside of the downtown core in the late 20th century and the city has struggled to rebuild and maintain a vibrant downtown core.  In the 2000s and early 2010s, projects aimed at revitalizing the downtown core included the creation of Market Square, a farmer's and craft market; the redevelopment of the Rainbow Center Mall; streetscape beautification projects; the conversion of several underutilized [[List of historic places in Greater Sudbury|historic properties]] into [[mixed-use development|mixed-use]] office and [[loft]] developments;<ref name=developers>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/sudbury-developers-tackle-old-downtown-buildings-1.1268389 "Sudbury developers tackle old downtown buildings"].[[CBC News]], December 10, 2012.</ref> and the establishment and launch of the [[McEwen School of Architecture]], as well as cultural events such as Downtown Rotary Blues for Food, Sudbury's Largest Yard and Sidewalk Sale, Downtown Sudbury Ribfest and the Up Here art and music festival. New projects underway in the late 2010s include Place des Arts, a performing and visual arts center;<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/place-des-arts-funding-1.4625176 "Place des Arts receives $250K boost from Desjardins"].

Despite these efforts a large percentage of the city's retail service sector is still found outside of the downtown core, in areas such as the Four Corners, the RioCan and Silver Hills [[Retail park|power centre]]s on the Kingsway, and the [[New Sudbury Centre]], the largest shopping mall in [[Northern Ontario]] with 110 stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsudburycentre.ca/leasing.html|title=Leasing|website=Newsudburycentre.ca|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>

=== Architecture ===
With the construction of the [[Laurentian University]] [[McEwen School of Architecture]], as well as increasing development  in the city, architecture has become an increasingly important part of the economy in Sudbury.

Notable architecture in Greater Sudbury:

* [[Ledo Hotel]], a historic building in downtown Sudbury, which has seen many uses since its construction in 1910. 
* St. Andrew's Place, a church-community-complex which opened in 1972.
* Sudbury's [[Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue (Sudbury)|Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue]], is a community-led synagogue which was constructed in 1960 and is the only synagogue in Sudbury.
*[[Moses Block]], Durham at Elgin, Sudbury's only flatiron building built in 1907<ref>{{Cite web|title=Then & Now: The link between a Romanian Jew who accidentally ended up in Sudbury and the downtown flatiron building|url=https://www.sudbury.com/then-and-now/then-now-the-link-between-a-romanian-jew-who-accidentally-ended-up-in-sudbury-and-the-downtown-flatiron-building-2777056|access-date=2021-05-03|website=Sudbury.com|date=October 8, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Canadian post-secondary institutions have also impacted the city's science and technology sectors. The Creighton Mine site in Sudbury is home to [[SNOLAB]], the second-deepest (after [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]] in China) underground laboratory in the world and the site of numerous [[dark matter]] experiments. Originally constructed for the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (now concluded), the underground laboratory has been expanded and continues to operate as SNOLAB. The SNO equipment has been refurbished for use in the [[SNO+]] experiment.{{r|snoplus.phy.queensu.ca}}

==Infrastructure==
===Health care===
Greater Sudbury serves as the health care center for much of northeastern Ontario through [[Health Sciences North]]. Sudbury is also the site of the Regional Cancer Program, which treats cancer patients from across the north. Sudbury's first General Hospital opened in 1950 and operated until 2010. Now, known as St. Joseph Health Center, the building remains abandoned and the new Sudbury Regional Hospital functions with Health Sciences North on Ramsey Lake Road. In 1968, the first successful [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] in Canada was performed at Sudbury Memorial Hospital.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pioneer cardiac interventionist retiring |url=https://www.thesudburystar.com/2016/04/26/pioneer-cardiac-interventionist-retiring/wcm/a5c8c685-feff-be97-8f1d-bf049e0bda27 |publisher=The Sudbury Star |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> Adult mental health services are also provided to the area through Health Sciences North, primarily at the Kirkwood site (formerly the Sudbury Algoma Hospital) and at the Cedar site downtown. Children's mental health services are provided through the Regional Children's Psychiatric Center operated by the Northeast Mental Health Center, located onsite at the Kirkwood Site of Health Sciences North.

===Emergency services===
Greater Sudbury is served by the [[Greater Sudbury Police Service]],<ref>{{cite web | title =Greater Sudbury Police Service | url =http://www.police.sudbury.on.ca/ | access-date = 2007-09-06 }}</ref> headquartered in downtown Sudbury. There is also a detachment of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] located in the McFarlane Lake area of the city's south end. Greater Sudbury Emergency Medical Services provides prehospital paramedic services with over 150 full-time and part-time paramedics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.greatersudbury.on.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_ems&lang=en&currID=3077 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723205148/http://www.city.greatersudbury.on.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_ems&lang=en&currID=3077 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |title=Ambulance - About Us |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=City.greatersudbury.on.ca |publisher=City of Sudbury |access-date=27 August 2013 }}</ref> Greater Sudbury Fire Services operates from 24 fire stations located throughout the city,<ref>{{cite news |title=Fire services reviewing efficiencies |author=Arron Pickard |url=http://www.northernlife.ca/news/localNews/2012/04/09-fire-services-review-sudbury.aspx |newspaper=[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]] |date=9 April 2012 |access-date=27 August 2013}}</ref> with a combination 103 career staff and 350 volunteer fire fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.greatersudbury.on.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_fireservices&lang=en |title=Fire Services - About Us |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=City.greatersudbury.on.ca |publisher=City of Sudbury |access-date=27 August 2013 |archive-date=April 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413105147/http://www.city.greatersudbury.on.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_fireservices&lang=en |url-status=dead }}</ref> Prior to the municipal amalgamation of 2001, most of the suburban towns were served by separate [[volunteer fire department]]s, which were amalgamated into the citywide service as part of the municipal restructuring. The municipally owned energy provider [[Greater Sudbury Utilities]] serves the city's urban core, while rural areas in the city continue to be served by [[Hydro One]].

===Transportation===

====Public transportation====

The city maintains a bus-based [[public transport|public transit]] system, [[GOVA]], transporting 4.4 million passengers in 2012.<ref name="PricewaterhouseCoopers">{{cite book |title=City of Greater Sudbury Annual Financial Report For the year ended December 31, 2012 |url=http://www.greatersudbury.ca/sudburyen/assets/File/2012%20Annual%20Financial%20Report(1).pdf |access-date= August 14, 2013 |year=1013 |publisher= [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]|page=1}}</ref> The year 2000 marked the most significant change in Greater Sudbury's local transit history, as outlying townships were annexed into the municipality to form Greater Sudbury, expanding Greater Sudbury Transit's service area to one larger than most Ontario municipal and regional public transit agencies. The Downtown Transit Center is the primary hub for local transit in Sudbury.

====Air====

[[File:Greater Sudbury Airport (5707786702).jpg|thumb|[[Sudbury Airport]] is an [[airport]] that serves Greater Sudbury, handling scheduled flights throughout Ontario.]]

The [[Sudbury Airport|Greater Sudbury Airport]] maintains two paved runways {{convert|6600|ft|abbr=on|}} and {{convert|5000|ft|abbr=on}}<ref>{{CFS}}</ref> in length and serves 270,784 passengers per year (2017).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flysudbury.ca/flysudbury/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91%3Afacts-and-demographics&catid=35%3Abusiness-gsa&Itemid=53&lang=en |title=Facts and Demographics |publisher=Greater Sudbury Airport |access-date=August 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115113749/http://www.flysudbury.ca/flysudbury/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91%3Afacts-and-demographics&catid=35%3Abusiness-gsa&Itemid=53&lang=en |archive-date=November 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The airport is served by three regional carrier lines: [[Air Canada Express]] to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], [[Porter Airlines]] to [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport]] and [[Bearskin Airlines]] to several destinations in Northern Ontario including [[North Bay/Jack Garland Airport|North Bay]], [[Sault Ste. Marie Airport|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Timmins Victor M. Power Airport|Timmins]] and [[Thunder Bay International Airport|Thunder Bay]].

====Intercity transportation====
[[File:Intercity Transport Hubs in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.png|thumb|left|Intercity Transport Hubs in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada]]
Several different agencies provide intercity transportation to Sudbury. [[Via Rail]]'s [[Sudbury–White River train]] (a remnant of the old ''Lake Superior'' passenger service to [[Thunder Bay]]) serves a number of remote interior communities, some of which are not accessible by road, from the downtown [[Sudbury station (Ontario)|Sudbury station]]. To the north and east of the city, [[Capreol station]] and [[Sudbury Junction station]] are stops on Via Rail's transcontinental passenger service, the ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'', which passes through the area twice a week in each direction.

Intercity motor coach service is available at the [[Sudbury Ontario Northland Bus Terminal]], which is a stop for [[Ontario Northland Transportation Commission|Ontario Northland]] motor coaches. Destinations include North Bay, [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]], [[Barrie]], [[Toronto]], and [[Ottawa]].
{{Clear}}

====Roads and highways====

{{See also|List of numbered roads in Greater Sudbury}}

There are three highways connecting Sudbury to the rest of Ontario: [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway 17]] is the main branch of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], connecting the city to points east and west. An approximately {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} segment of Highway 17, from Mikkola to Whitefish, is [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]]. The highway bypasses the city via two separately-constructed roads, the [[Southwest and Southeast Bypasses]], that form a partial [[ring road]] around the southern end of the city's urban core for traffic travelling through Highway 17. The former alignment of Highway 17 through the city is now [[Sudbury Municipal Road 55|Municipal Road 55]]. [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway 69]], also a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, leads south to [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]], where it connects to the [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]] freeway to Toronto; Highway 400 is being extended to Greater Sudbury and is scheduled for completion in the 2020s.<ref name=delayed>[http://www.thesudburystar.com/2015/03/06/highway-69-to-be-delayed-province-admits "Highway 69 to be delayed, province admits"]. ''[[Sudbury Star]]'', March 7, 2015.</ref> [[Ontario Highway 144|Highway 144]] leads north to [[Ontario Highway 101|Highway 101]] in [[Timmins]].

Greater Sudbury is the only census division in Northern Ontario that maintains a system of numbered [[List of numbered roads in Greater Sudbury|municipal roads]], similar to the [[County highway#Canada|county road]] system in the southern part of the province. Secondary [[Ontario Highway 537|Highway 537]], which essentially provides an outer bypass link between Highway 69 at Wanup and Highway 17 at Wahnapitae, is also the only remaining secondary highway in the province located in any census division which also has its own municipal or county road system.

==Media==
{{Main|Media in Greater Sudbury}}
As the largest city in Northern Ontario, Greater Sudbury is the region's primary media center. Due to the relatively small size of the region's individual media markets, most of the region is served at least partially by Sudbury-based media. [[CICI-TV]] produces almost all local programming on the [[CTV Northern Ontario]] system, and the [[CBC Radio]] stations [[CBCS-FM]] and [[CBON-FM]] broadcast to the entire region through extensive [[Broadcast relay station|rebroadcaster]] networks. As well, many of the commercial radio stations in Northeastern Ontario's smaller cities simulcast programming produced in Sudbury for at least a portion of their programming schedules, particularly in weekend and evening slots.

Sudbury's daily newspaper, the ''[[Sudbury Star]]'' is owned by [[Postmedia Network|Postmedia]], is published six days a week and has a weekday circulation of 17,530 as of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northernlife.ca/advertising/2006/EffectiveRecruitment.pdf |title=Advertising Rates & Specs |publisher=Northern Star |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518184946/http://www.northernlife.ca/advertising/2006/EffectiveRecruitment.pdf |archive-date=May 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The city's longtime community newspaper ''[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]]'' ceased print publication in 2020, concurrently with its sale from [[Laurentian Media Group]] to [[Village Media]], and remains in operation as the web-only publication ''Sudbury.com''.

There is also a weekly francophone publication, ''[[Le Voyageur]]''. ''The South Side Story'' used to be a print and online publication but has been defunct since 2019.

==Notable people==
{{Main|List of people from Greater Sudbury}}
Notable people from Sudbury include television game-show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' host [[Alex Trebek]] (which he hosted from 1984 to his death in 2020), [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Michelle O'Bonsawin]], architect [[Jason F.
