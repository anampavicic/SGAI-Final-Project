'''Laval''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|v|æ|l}} {{respell|lə|VAL}}, {{IPA|fr|laval|lang|Fr-Paris--Laval.ogg}}) is a city in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. It is in the southwest of the province, north of [[Montreal]]. It is the largest suburb of [[Greater Montreal|Montreal]], the [[List of towns in Quebec|third-largest city]] in the province after Montreal and [[Quebec City]], and the [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|thirteenth]] largest city in Canada, with a population of 443,192 in [[2016 Canadian Census|2021]].

Laval is geographically separated from the mainland to the north by the [[Rivière des Mille Îles]], and from the [[Island of Montreal]] to the south by the [[Rivière des Prairies]]. Laval occupies all of [[Île Jésus]] as well as the [[Îles Laval]].

Laval constitutes one of the 17 [[List of Quebec regions|administrative regions of Quebec]], with a region code of 13, as well as a [[territory equivalent to a regional county municipality]] (TE) and [[Census geographic units of Canada|census division]] (CD) with geographical code 65. It also constitutes the [[Judicial districts of Quebec|judicial district]] of Laval.<ref>[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/D_11/D11_A.HTM ''Territorial Division Act'']. ''Revised Statutes of Quebec'' D-11.</ref> It is the smallest administrative region in the province by area.

==History==
{{See also|Municipal history of Quebec}}
[[File:Farmland. Farm in Laval des Rapides BAnQ P48S1P06800.jpg|thumb|left|Farm in [[Laval-des-Rapides]] in 1941]]
The first European Settlers in Laval were [[Jesuits]], who were granted a [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneury]] there in 1636. Agriculture first appeared in Laval in 1670. In 1675, [[François de Montmorency-Laval]] gained control of the seigneury. In 1702 a [[parish municipality (Quebec)|parish municipality]] was founded, and dedicated to [[Saint-François, Laval, Quebec|Saint-François de Sales]] (not to be confused with the modern-day [[Saint-François-de-Sales, Quebec|Saint-François-de-Sales]] in [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]]).

In 1845, after nearly 200 years being of a rural nature, additional municipalities began to be created. The only built-up area on the island, [[Sainte-Rose, Quebec|Sainte-Rose]], was incorporated as a village in 1850, and it remained the main community for the remainder of the century. With the dawn of the 20th century came urbanization. [[Laval-des-Rapides]] became Laval's first city in 1912, followed by {{interlanguage link|L'Abord-à-Plouffe|fr|L'Abord-à-Plouffe}}, which was granted village status three years later. [[Laval-sur-le-Lac]] was founded in the same year and had its tourist-based economy based on Montrealers. Laval began to grow throughout the following years because its proximity to Montreal made it an ideal suburb.

To deal with problems caused by urbanization, amalgamations occurred; L'Abord-à-Plouffe amalgamated with {{interlanguage link|Renaud, Quebec|fr|Renaud (Laval)}} and [[Saint-Martin, Laval, Quebec|Saint-Martin]], creating the city of Chomedey in 1961. The amalgamation turned out to be so successful for the municipalities involved that the Quebec government decided to amalgamate the whole island into a single city of Laval in 1965, not without controversy.<ref name="Birth">{{cite news|last = Seale|first = Lewis|title = Upper house gives in, accepts bill changes|newspaper = [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]|page = 1|publisher = [[Postmedia Network]]|date = 7 August 1965|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XYY1AAAAIBAJ&dq=montreal%20gazette%20amalgamation%20laval&pg=5690%2C948587= |access-date=2013-04-01}}</ref> Laval was named after the first owner of Île Jésus, [[François de Montmorency-Laval]], the first [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Quebec]]. At the time, Laval had a population of 170,000. Laval became a [[Regional County Municipality]] in 1980. Until then, it had been the County of Laval.<ref name="historylaval">{{cite web | title=History and Heritage | work=Laval portal website | url=http://www.ville.laval.qc.ca/pls/wlav/wlav.site.show?p_type=1&p_no=2 | access-date=8 November 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207002927/http://ville.laval.qc.ca/pls/wlav/wlav.site.show?p_type=1&p_no=2 | archive-date=7 February 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Geography==
The island has developed over time, with most of the urban area in the central region and along the south and west river banks.

Laval is bordered on the south by [[Montreal]] across the [[Rivière des Prairies]], on the north by [[Les Moulins Regional County Municipality]] and by [[Thérèse-De Blainville Regional County Municipality]] and on the west by [[Deux-Montagnes Regional County Municipality]] across the [[Rivière des Mille Îles]].

===Climate===
Laval experiences a four-season [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen]]: Dfb) with very warm summers and very cold winters with adequate precipitation year-round, though more so during summer and early fall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=ste+dorothee&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=5460&dispBack=1|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000 Station Data - Climate - Environment and Climate Change Canada|last=Canada|first=Environment and Climate Change|date=2011-01-19|website=climate.weather.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>{{Weather box|width=auto

==Economy==
[[File:Tour Triomphe II, Laval, Québec.jpg|thumb|Office buildings in Laval]]
Laval's diverse economy is centred around the technology, pharmaceutical, industrial and retail sectors. It has many pharmaceutical laboratories but also stone quarries and a persistent agricultural sector. Long seen as a [[bedroom community]], Laval has diversified its economy, especially in the retail sector, developing numerous shopping malls, [[warehouses]] and various retail stores. Laval has four different [[industrial park]]s.<ref name="lavaltechnopole">{{cite web|title=Laval Technopole website |url=http://www.lavaltechnopole.com/en/ |access-date=2 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092737/http://www.lavaltechnopole.com/en/ |archive-date=29 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The first is Industrial Park Centre, in the heart of Laval at the corner of St. Martin West and Industriel Blvd. One of the largest municipal industrial parks in [[Quebec]], the Industrial Park Centre boasts the highest concentration of manufacturing companies in Laval: 1,024 at last count, and 22,378 employees. The park still has {{convert|1300643|m²|0|abbr=on}} of space available.

The second, the [[Quebec Autoroute 25|Autoroute 25]] Industrial Park is at the crossroads of the metropolitan road network. Inaugurated in 2001, this new industrial municipal space has been a tremendous success, boasting an 80% occupancy rate. Laval is studying the possibility of expanding this park in the next few years.

The third, known as Industrial Park East, is in the neighbourhood of [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]]. This park has reached full capacity with a 100% occupancy rate. Industrial Park East is currently part of a municipal program to revitalize municipal services and public utilities. Laval is working with a private developer on an expansion project for the park that should be announced in the near future.

The fourth industrial park, the Laval Science and High Technology Park is located along [[Rivière des Prairies]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 15|Autoroute 15]]. It is an internationally renowned science campus that houses the [[Biotech]] City and the Information Technology Development Centre (ITDC). The Laval Science and High Technology Park is a beacon of the [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] economy, in an environment befitting the best technopolises in the world. Nearly {{convert|500000|m2|sqft}} of space are available for development. The Biotech City spans the entire territory of the Laval Science and High Technology Park and is a unique concept in Canada in that its residents comprise both universities and companies.

Created in 1995, Laval Technopole is a nonprofit organization that has the objective to promote the economic growth of Laval by attracting and supporting new business and investments located in its 5 territory poles: Biopole, e-Pol, Agropole, industrial pole and Leisure/tourism.

====Flag, seal and motto====
On a white-yellow background, the emblem of Laval illustrates the modernism of a city in full expansion. The sign of the city symbolizes the "L" of Laval.

The colours also have a significant meaning:
* Dark red represents the affluence and economic potential of Laval.
* Blue symbolizes the quality of life and the installation of a human city.

The "L" of Laval is made of cubes that represent the development of Laval.

The letters of the Laval signature are related one to the other to point out the merger of the 14 municipalities of [[Jesus island]] in 1965.

The logo (that is on the flag) has existed since the 1980s and the flag since the 1990s.<ref name="logolaval">{{cite web | title=Flags of the World| work=Flags of the World website | url=https://www.fotw.info/flags/ca-lav.html | access-date=16 July 2005 }}</ref>

Federally, prior to 1984 Laval had been a bastion of [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] support. From 1984 to 1993 the Conservative dominated Laval but have not won a seat since.Since the 90's Laval has been a battleground area between the Quebec separatist parties (the ''[[Bloc Québécois]]'' federally and the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' provincially) and the federalist parties (various parties federally and the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] provincially). In 2011, amid an NDP surge in the province they swept all 4 seats in Laval for the first and only time. Since the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]] the Liberals have held all seats.

Provincially the other parts of Laval have drifted to the provincial Liberals in recent years. While the PQ held every Laval riding except [[Chomedey (electoral district)|Chomedey]] (which voted overwhelmingly to not separate in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]]) during their second stint in government between 1994 and 2003. The Liberals won every Laval riding in 2003, 2007, and 2008. During the [[2012 Quebec general election|2012 election]], the PQ saw some gains in Laval when they captured 2 seats, but both returned to the Liberal fold during the [[2014 Quebec general election|2014 election]]. During the [[2018 Quebec general election|2018 election]] amid a rise of the CAQ, the Liberals held their own in the Laval losing only 1 seat to the CAQ. In the [[2022 Quebec general election|2022 election]] the CAQ captured 3 more seats in Laval netting them 4 out of 6 seats and ending the dominance of the Liberals in Laval since the 2003 election. The Conservative Party of Quebec saw its vote share jump from just under 2% in 2018 to third place with just under 13%.

===Public transit===
;Montreal Metro
[[File:Station Montmorency 12.JPG|thumb|right|A train arriving at [[Montmorency (Montreal Metro)|Montmorency Station]] in the [[Montreal Metro]]]]
In April 2007, the [[Montreal Metro]] was extended to Laval with three stations. The long-awaited stations were begun in 2003 and completed in April 2007, two months ahead of the revised schedule, at a cost of C$803&nbsp;million, funded entirely by the [[Quebec government]]. The stations are [[Cartier (Montreal Metro)|Cartier]], [[De La Concorde station|De La Concorde]], and [[Montmorency (Montreal Metro)|Montmorency]]. The arrival of the Metro in Laval was long-awaited as it was first promised in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Former mayor, [[Gilles Vaillancourt]], announced his wish to loop the [[Line 2 Orange (Montreal Metro)|Orange line]] from [[Montmorency (Montreal Metro)|Montmorency]] to [[Côte-Vertu (Montreal Metro)|Côte-Vertu]] stations with the addition of six new stations (three in Laval and another three in Montreal). He proposed that [[Transports Quebec]], the provincial transport department, set aside C$100&nbsp;million annually to fund the project, which was expected to cost upwards of $1.5&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web |author=CA |url=http://www.courrierlaval.com/article-123701-Montreal-a-bien-dautres-priorites.html |title=Montréal a bien d'autres priorités&nbsp;– Transport en commun |publisher=Courrier Laval |date=22 July 2007 |access-date=2012-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527075138/http://www.courrierlaval.com/article-123701-Montreal-a-bien-dautres-priorites.html |archive-date=27 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

;Commuter rail
The [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]] public transit agency's [[Saint-Jérôme line|Saint-Jérôme]] [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter train]] line traverses the island, connecting Laval to downtown Montreal. There are currently three train stations in Laval: [[De La Concorde station|De la Concorde]] (an intermodal station offering transfer to the metro), [[Vimont station|Vimont]] and [[Sainte-Rose station|Sainte-Rose]].

The [[Deux-Montagnes line|Deux-Montagnes]] commuter train line served the western tip of Laval until it was closed on December 31, 2020. Work is underway to replace it with the [[Réseau express métropolitain]] (REM) light metro system.

;Buses
[[File:Terminus Montmorency view.jpg|thumb|right|Montmorency Terminus]]
The [[Société de transport de Laval]] (STL) provides local bus service in Laval. The STL's network consists of 35 regular lines, two rush hour lines, two trainbus lines, three express lines, one community circuit and several taxi lines.

There are [[Bus lane|reserved lanes]] for buses and taxis on Chomedey Blvd between Le Carrefour Blvd and the [[Rivière des Prairies|Des Prairies River]] ([[Lachapelle Bridge]]) and beyond as well as along boulevard des Laurentides between rue Proulx and boulevard Cartier (the reserved lane, in this case for buses only, continues onto the [[Pont Viau]] bridge into Montreal until the [[Henri-Bourassa Terminus Nord (AMT)|Terminus Laval]] at the [[Henri-Bourassa (Montreal Metro)|Henri-Bourassa]] [[Montreal Metro|Metro station]]). Most buses that use the reserved lane end their journey at the [[Cartier (Montreal Metro)|Cartier]] Metro station. The AMT and the City of Laval have developed [[Bus lane|reserved bus and taxi lanes]] on Notre-Dame Boulevard between Vincent Massey Street and Place Alton-Goldbloom and another on De la Concorde Blvd between De l'Avenir and Laval Blvds, as well as between Ampere Ave and Roanne St. These reserved lanes (Notre-Dame and De la Concorde are the same boulevard but change name where they meet under [[Quebec Autoroute 15|Autoroute 15]]) opened shortly after 31 October 2007.
