'''Debre Markos''' ({{lang-am|ደብረ ማርቆስ|Däbrä Marḳos lit: ''Mount of St. Mark''}}) is a city, separate woreda, and administrative seat of the [[Misrak Gojjam Zone|East Gojjam Zone]] in [[Amhara Region]], [[Ethiopia]].<ref name=Aethiopica31/>

==Etymology==
Originally named Manqwarar (lit: Cold Place){{refn|group=note|'''Manqwarar''' was also spelled as '''Moncorer''', '''Mankorar''' and the French variation was spelled as '''Menqouarer'''. it was still known as '''Manqwarar''' for quite a few decades after its name change to '''Debre Markos''', as it could be seen on a world map published in 1917.<ref name=Aethiopica31/><ref name=DebreMarkos/>}}, the town was founded in 1853 by [[dejazmach]] [[Tedla Gwalu]], the then ruler of [[Gojjam]]. In the 1880s, his successor [[Negus]] [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymanot]] built the [[Church of Markos]], dedicated to Saint Markos, and named the town after it.{{refn|group=note|Another version on its name change was from a German delegation led by [[Friedrich Rosen]] on 31 March 1905, the party claimed that town's name was changed from '''Manqwarar (Monkorer)''' to '''Debre Markos''' by [[Ras (title)|Ras]] Bezabeh, the son of [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]], however the Rosen party also noted that they considered '''Bezabeh''' to be unimportant.<ref name=DebreMarkos/>}}.<ref name=DebreMarkos/><ref name=Aethiopica31/><ref name="NAI-web">[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB2.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227131228/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB2.pdf|date=2008-02-27}} The city is named Debre Markos after its principal church, which was established in 1869 and dedicated to St. Markos.The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 6 December 2007)</ref>

==History==
[[File:Debre Markos Arch.jpg|thumb|The arch of [[Negus]] [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]] in Debre Markos]]
=== 19th century ===
In 1869 Debre Markos (then Manqwarar) became the seat of the provincial ruler, [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Ras Adal]], who later assumed the name [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymanot]] and title [[Negus]] of [[Gojjam]].  During his reign and as a result, Pankhurst notes, the population of Debre Markos "fluctuated greatly with the presence of absence of the army" of the Negus.  King Tekle Haymanot led the Gojjame forces in the Battle of Embabo against the Shewans in a battle for supremacy, and nearly won. Had Gojjam been victorious, Debre Markos would have been the capital and largest city of Ethiopia, with the emperor being Tekle Haymanot in 1889 (he would adopt a new name upon coronation). Pankhurst further stated that when the Nigus (King) resided in the town, it had between 20,000 and 40,000 inhabitants; in his absence, between 5,000 and 6,000. The explorer [[Pellegrino Matteucci]] (b. 1850) arrived at what was at that time named Monkorer on 3 June 1879, explored the neighboring area, then departed 20 June for [[Adwa]] and [[Massawa]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

=== 20th century ===
In March 1900 an expedition led by [[Percy Powell-Cotton]] visited Debre Markos and noted that ‘‘the town looked more like a town than [[Menelik II|Menelik's]] capital."

The palace of ''[[Nigus]]'' [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haimanot]] was remodeled in 1926 by his son ''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'' [[Hailu Tekle Haymanot]], in the style of European buildings after his tour of Europe in the party of ''Ras'' [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Tefari]]. In 1935, the town had postal, telegraph, and telephone service.<ref name="NAI-web"/>

The Italians arrived in Debre Markos 20 May 1936. Through an interpreter, [[Achille Starace]], who had arrived by plane, told the surprised local inhabitants that he had come to free them from their oppressors to their thorough bemusement. Debre Markos was later isolated and practically besieged by a revolt in 1938. General [[Ugo Cavallero]], with sixty thousand men and supported by airplanes and tanks, had crushed the revolt by the end of May.<ref name="NAI-web"/> A major [[Italy|Italian]] fortification was located in the city during the existence of [[Italian East Africa]], and captured by the British [[Gideon Force]] and Ethiopian [[Arbegnoch]] (or Resistance Fighters) 3 April 1941 during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].

In 1957, Nigus Tekle Haimanot School in Debre Markos was one of 9 provincial secondary schools in Ethiopia. The next year, the town was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as a First Class Township. In 1960 a branch of the [[Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority]] had started operation in Debre Markos.<ref name="NAI-web"/>

In 1968 locals in Debre Markos and surrounding districts rebelled against the regional administration after series of accumulated burdens on civilians. The final straw was an attempt to introduce a new agricultural income tax. The population resisted the tax assessors, sent the customary petitions to the emperor to reverse the order and, when no response was forthcoming, rose in rebellion. The rebellion was eventually put down by the national army. The locals however won their cause; the tax order was scrapped.<ref name=DebreMarkos/>

=== 21st century === 
In the national elections of 15 May 2005 the constituency of Debre Markos had  44 polling stations and 38,606 registered voters of whom 84% cast their votes. [[Coalition for Unity and Democracy]] dominated with 19,620 votes represented by candidate Ato [[Dereje Atinafu Dagachew]]. Far behind was the unpopular ruling [[EPRDF]] regime with 7,626 votes represented by candidate Ato Webishet Lengerih Mebirate. The [[United Ethiopian Democratic Forces]] party received 449 votes and two independent candidates 362 and 285 votes. The remaining 4,201 votes are not explained. After the national elections there were student demonstrations in Debre Markos and other towns in early June 2005. [[Human Rights Watch]] obtained reports of mass arrests of students by police.<ref name=DebreMarkos/>
