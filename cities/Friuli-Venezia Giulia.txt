The regional capital is [[Trieste]] on the [[Gulf of Trieste]], a bay of the [[Adriatic Sea]].

Friuli-Venezia Giulia has an area of {{convert|7,924|km2}} and about 1.2 million inhabitants. A natural opening to the sea for many [[central Europe]]an countries, the region is traversed by the major transport routes between the east and west of [[Southern Europe]]. It encompasses the historical-geographical region of [[Friuli]] and a small portion of the historical region of {{lang|it|Venezia Giulia}}—also known in English as the [[Julian March]]—each with its own distinct history, traditions and identity.

==Name==
''Friuli'' comes from the [[Latin]] term {{lang|la|Forum Julii}} ('[[Julius Caesar|Julius]]' [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]'), a center for [[commerce]] in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, which today corresponds to the city of [[Cividale del Friuli|Cividale]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Friuli-Venezia Giulia: l'origine del nome |url=https://www.udinetoday.it/social/origine-nome-friuli-venezia-giulia-storia.html |access-date=2023-08-03 |website=UdineToday |language=it}}</ref> The denomination ''Venezia Giulia'' ('Julian Venetia', not referring to the city of [[Venice]] but to the Roman province of [[Venetia et Histria]]) was proposed by the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]], with the intention of marking the Italian cultural spirit of the area.<ref name=":0" />

[[File:Foro romano di Aquileia.jpg|thumb|Roman ruins in [[Aquileia]]]]

In Roman times, modern Friuli-Venezia Giulia was located within [[Venetia et Histria|Regio X Venetia et Histria]] of Roman Italy. The traces of its [[ancient Rome|Roman origin]] are visible all over the area. In fact, the city of [[Aquileia]], founded in 181 BC, served as the regional capital and rose to prominence in the [[Emperor Augustus|Augustan]] era.

Following the [[Lombards|Lombard]] settlements in the 6th century, the historical paths of Friuli and Venezia Giulia began to diverge. In 568, [[Cividale del Friuli]] (the Roman ''Forum Iulii'' (from which the name Friuli is derived)) became the capital of the [[Duchy of Friuli|first Lombard dukedom]] in Italy. In the 6th century, the [[Alpine Slavs]], ancestors of present-day [[Slovenes]], [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|settled the eastern areas of the region]]. They settled in the easternmost mountainous areas of Friuli known as the [[Friulian Slavia]], as well as in the [[Karst Plateau]] and in the area north and south of [[Gorizia]]. In the 12th and 13th centuries, they also moved closer to Trieste.

In 774 [[Charlemagne]] conquered [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard Italy]] and absorbed it into [[Francia]] (the Frankish Empire from 800), with the Lombard Duke of Friuli replaced by a Frankish one. In 787 Charlemagne established a new [[patriarch]] at [[Aquileia]]. The duchy was dissolved in 828 and partitioned into smaller counties. In 843 the Empire was partitioned in the [[Treaty of Verdun]] placing Friuli at the frontier between [[Middle Francia]] (later the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]]) and [[East Francia]] (later the [[Kingdom of Germany]]) and in 846 the former duchy was reconstituted as the [[March of Friuli]]. In 961 [[Otto the Great]] of Germany took control of Italy and established the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1077, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] recognized the territorial powers of the [[Patria del Friuli|Patriarchate of Aquileia]] that temporarily extended its rule to areas to the east; however, by the 12th century the [[County of Gorizia]] had become independent. Trieste developed into the [[Imperial Free City of Trieste]]. The coastal territory between Gorizia and Trieste was controlled by the [[March of Carniola]] ([[Duchy of Carniola]] from 1364).

[[File:Miramare2.jpg|thumb|[[Miramare Castle]], built by Archduke [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Austria]], later [[Second Mexican Empire|Emperor of Mexico]], in Trieste]]
Friuli became [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory in 1420; Trieste and Gorizia, which remained within the Holy Roman Empire, came under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] (Austrian) dominance in 1382 and 1500 respectively. The Venetian fortress of [[Gradisca d'Isonzo]] was retaken by the Empire in 1511 and incorporated into Gorizia but [[Monfalcone]] to the south remained an effective Venetian exclave. [[Pordenone]] was a {{lang|la|corpus separatum}}, under Austrian influence until 1515, when it fell to Venetian rule. Gradisca was separated from Gorizia in 1647 but were reunited in 1754 to form the [[Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca]].

With the 1797 [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Venetian domination came to an end and Friuli was ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy (formally part of the [[Austrian Empire]] from 1804); however, Austria was forced to cede it to the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]] in the 1805 [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]], along with the parts of the County of Gorizia and Gradisca west of the [[Isonzo]] (the boundary was formalized in the 1807 Treaty of Fontainebleau). Trieste and Gorizia were then also ceded to the Napoleonic [[Illyrian Provinces]] in the 1809 [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]].

In 1815, following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned the area to Austria: Friuli was included in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]], while Gorizia and Trieste were assigned to the [[Kingdom of Illyria]] (both crown lands of the Austrian Empire), with the boundary roughly following the former Imperial-Venetian border. In 1849 Illyria was abolished and Gorizia and Trieste both became part of the [[Austrian Littoral]] crown land, along with Istria and several islands in the [[Kvarner Gulf]].

Under the enlightened government and policies set by the Austrian Empire and continued by the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, Trieste flourished, reaching an extraordinary economic development as the main harbor of the Habsburg empire. The [[Third Italian War of Independence]] led to the annexation of Lombardy-Venetia, including Friuli, to the [[Kingdom of Italy]], while the Littoral remained in Austrian hands.

During the First World War, the region was a prominent theatre for military operations and suffered serious damage and loss of lives. After the war, the former Littoral was annexed by Italy in the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|1920 Treaty of Rapallo]], although [[Venezia Giulia]]'s borders were the subject of an international dispute.

The Second World War led to the creation of the [[Free Territory of Trieste|Anglo-American Administration in Trieste]] until the border was defined in the 1954 [[London Memorandum|Memorandum of London]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} After Trieste was reassigned to Italy, the Autonomous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia was finally established.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sito Ufficale della Regione Autonoma Friuli–Venezia Giulia – Versione Inglese |url=http://www.regione.fvg.it/inglese/pagine_interne/welcome_history.asp |access-date=5 May 2009 |publisher=Regione.fvg.it}}</ref>

The region's name was Friuli-Venezia Giulia (hyphenated) until 2001, when the official spelling ''Friuli Venezia Giulia'' (without hyphen) was adopted following the modification of Article No.116 of the Italian Constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 October 2001 |title=Modifiche al titolo V della parte seconda della Costituzione |url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/01003lc.htm |publisher=parlamento.it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana |url=http://www.governo.it/Governo/Costituzione/CostituzioneRepubblicaItaliana.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620220301/http://www.governo.it/Governo/Costituzione/CostituzioneRepubblicaItaliana.pdf |archive-date=20 June 2006 |access-date=10 September 2014 |language=it}}</ref><ref>Sarti, Gianpaolo: La Lega lancia la regione "Friuli e Trieste", in: {{Lang|it|[[Il Piccolo]]}}, 9 September 2014, p. 14.</ref> The term "Venezia Giulia" was coined by [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]].

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Friuli-Venezia Giulia is Italy's north-easternmost [[region of Italy|region]]. It covers an area of 7,858 km<sup>2</sup> and is the fifth smallest region of the country. It borders [[Austria]] to the north and [[Slovenia]] to the east, the three countries meeting at the [[tripoint]] on the mountain of [[Dreiländereck]], known as Monte Forno in Italian. To the south, it faces the [[Adriatic Sea]] and to the west the [[Veneto]] region.

The region spans a wide variety of climates and landscapes from the mild [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] in the south to [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] continental in the north. The total area is subdivided into 42.5% mountainous-alpine terrain in the north, 19.3% is hilly, mostly to the southeast, while the remaining 38.2% comprises the central and coastal plains.

[[File:Culino, part of the Forni Avoltri municipality, in Friuli, Italy.jpg|thumb|A view of the [[Carnia]] highlands]]
Morphologically the region can be subdivided into four main areas. The mountainous area in the north: this part of the region includes [[Carnia]] and the ending section of the [[Alps]] ([[Carnic Alps]] and [[Julian Alps]]), of which the highest peaks exceed 2,700&nbsp;m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] ([[Jôf di Montasio]] 2,754&nbsp;m). Its landscapes are characterised by vast pine forests and pastures, mountain lakes (e.g. [[Sauris]], Fusine, and [[Barcis]]), and numerous streams and small rivers descending from the mountains. 

The area is also known for its tourist destinations, especially during the winter season ([[Monte Zoncolan]], [[Tarvisio]], Sella Nevea, Forni di Sopra and Piancavallo). The hilly area is situated to the south of the mountains and along the central section of the [[Italy–Slovenia border|border with Slovenia]]. The main product of agriculture in this area is wine, whose quality, especially the white, is known worldwide. The easternmost part of the hilly area is also known as [[Slavia Friulana]], as it is mostly inhabited by ethnic [[Slovenes]]. 

The central plains are characterized by poor, arid, and permeable soil. The soil has been made fertile with an extensive irrigation system and through the adoption of modern intensive farming techniques. In this part of the region, most of the agricultural activities are concentrated. The coastal area can be further subdivided into two, western-eastern, subsections separated by the [[Soča|River Isonzo]]'s estuary. 

To the west, the coast is shallow and sandy, with numerous tourist resorts and the lagoons of [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] and [[Marano Lagunare]]. To the east, the coastline rises into cliffs, where the [[Karst Plateau]] meets the Adriatic, all the way to Trieste and Muggia on the border with Slovenia. The Carso has geological features and phenomena such as hollows, cave networks, and underground rivers, which extend inland in the provinces of Trieste and Gorizia, with an altitude ranging between 300m and 600m.

[[File:Laguna di Grado 02.jpg|thumb|[[Grado Lagoon]]]]
The rivers of the region flow from the North and from Slovenia into the [[Adriatic]]. The two main rivers are the [[Tagliamento]], which flows west–east in its upper part in the [[Carnic Alps]] and then bends into a north–south flow that separates the [[Julian Alps]] from Alpine foothills and the [[Isonzo]] (Slovenian: Soča) which flows from Slovenia into Italy. The [[Timavo]] is an underground river that flows for 38&nbsp; km from [[Slovenia]] and resurfaces near its mouth north-west of [[Duino]].

The region Friuli-Venezia Giulia has a [[temperate climate]]. However, due to the terrain's diversity, it varies considerably from one area to another. Walled by the [[Alps]] on its northern flank, the region is exposed to air masses from the East and the West. The region receives also the southerly [[Sirocco]] from the Adriatic Sea, which brings in heavy rainfall. Along the coast, the climate is mild and pleasant. 

Trieste records the smallest temperature differences between winter and summer and between day and night. The climate is [[Alpine-continental]] in the mountainous areas, where, in some locations, the coldest winter temperatures in Italy can often be found. The [[Kras Plateau|Kras plateau]] has its own weather and climate, influenced, mostly during autumn and winter, by masses of cold air coming from the northeast. These generate a very special feature of the local climate: the north-easterly wind [[Bora (wind)|Bora]], which descends onto the [[Gulf of Trieste]] with gusts occasionally exceeding speeds of 150&nbsp; km/h.

==Economy==

{{Advert section|date=January 2020}}
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 38 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.2% of Italy's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 31,200 euros or 103% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 106% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |website=Eurostat}}</ref>

[[File:Lignano faro.jpg|thumb|The sandy beach of [[Lignano Sabbiadoro]]]]
The economy of Friuli-Venezia Giulia is one of Italy's most successful. Its core is based on small and middle-size enterprises (the so-called "North-East model"), on specialized farming and on high-quality tourism with a significant inclination towards exports.<ref name="regportraits1">{{Cite web |title=Eurostat |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd4_eco.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418163221/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd4_eco.htm |archive-date=18 April 2010 |access-date=5 May 2009 |publisher=Circa.europa.eu}}</ref>

Agriculture and farming maintain an essential role in the economy of the region and employed in 2001 around 95,000 persons. Its products are exported not only within the country and Europe (fruit and vegetables, cheese) but have become known worldwide for their acclaimed quality (cured ham and wines, especially white ones). Noteworthy is also the production of soy (third producer in Italy with more than 37,000 hectares cultivated in 2000) and timber production in [[Carnia]].<ref name="regportraits1" />

The economy of the region is based on a widespread mosaic of small and medium-sized enterprises; of particular importance are the four industrial districts where a multitude of highly specialised enterprises are concentrated. These districts are centred around the towns of [[Manzano, Italy|Manzano]], [[San Daniele del Friuli]] (cured ham), [[Maniago]] (knives), and [[Brugnera]] (furniture). Several large enterprises are also present in the region in both the industry and services sectors. Some of these companies are world leaders in their relevant sectors; such are [[Fincantieri]] (headquarters in Trieste with shipyards in [[Monfalcone]]) for the construction of the world's largest cruise ships, [[Zanussi]]-[[Electrolux]] ([[Pordenone]]) in the production of electrical appliances, [[Danieli]], [[Eurotech (company)|Eurotech]], [[Illy]], [[Rizzani de Eccher]], [[Solari di Udine]], TBS Group, [[Banca Generali]], [[Genertellife]], [[Italia Marittima]], [[Telit]], [[Wärtsilä]], [[Allianz]] Italia and [[Assicurazioni Generali]] in Trieste, a leading insurance company in the world.<ref name="regportraits1" />

[[File:Porttrieste old.jpg|thumb|The port of Trieste]]
In the services sector, the city of Trieste plays a leading role (with knock-on effects on the other provincial capitals); it is here that activities such as the regional government, large banking, and insurance companies are concentrated.  

The unemployment rate stood at 5.7% in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Unemployment NUTS 2 regions Eurostat |url=https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=lfst_r_lfu3rt&lang=en |language=en}}</ref> 

===Transport===
With its commercial Free Port, Trieste also plays an essential role in the trade sector: special custom regulations ensure exclusive financial conditions to operators. The Port of Trieste is today the most important centre worldwide for the trade of coffee and plays a strategic key role in trade with northern and eastern Europe.<ref name="regportraits1" />

[[File:Unioni territoriali intercomunali del Friuli-Venezia Giulia.png|thumb|upright=1.6|New subdivisions since January 2018]]
Although small in size, Friuli-Venezia Giulia has always been 'in the centre of Europe' and has played an important role in connecting Italy (and the Mediterranean) to Central and Eastern Europe. Its role will become even more strategic as a logistical platform with the imminent enlargement of the European Union. Hence the importance of the infrastructure network of the region, which can today be considered first-rate in quality and diversity. The motorway network consists of more than 200&nbsp;km that runs from North to South and from West to East, connecting the region to [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]].<ref name="regportraits1" />

The railway network consists of around 500&nbsp;km of track, with the two twin-line 'backbones' Venice-Trieste and Trieste-Udine-Tarvisio-Austria. The motorway and railway networks are linked to the ports of Trieste, Monfalcone, and Porto Nogaro, the three most northerly ports of the Mediterranean. Trieste, in particular, has a free port for goods since 1719. It is the Italian port with the greatest capacity for covered storage, with a surface area of more than 2 million square meters and 70&nbsp;km of rail tracks. Intermodality is guaranteed by the [[Cervignano del Friuli|Cervignano]] terminal, in operation since 1988, to serve the increasing commercial traffic between Italy and Eastern European countries.<ref name="regportraits1" />

The regional airport of [[Ronchi dei Legionari]] is situated 30&nbsp;km from Trieste and 40&nbsp;km from [[Udine]] and is closely connected to the motorway and railway networks. The airport offers regular national and international flights including destinations in Eastern Europe. The region is now placing much of its hopes for future economic development in the construction of a high-speed [[Pan-European corridors|European Transport Corridor n° V]] connecting Lyon, Turin, Venice, Trieste, Ljubljana, Budapest, and Kyiv, so as to improve the traffic of goods and services with new EU partners.<ref name="regportraits1" />

Population density is lower than the national average: In 1978 there were in total only 1,224,611 inhabitants;<ref>Prost, Brigitte: Le Frioul.Région d#affrontements, Géneve 1973.</ref> in 2008 it was 157.5 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> (compared to 198.8 for Italy as a whole). However, density varies from a minimum of 106 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> in the province of Udine to a maximum of 1,144 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> in the province of Trieste.

The negative natural balance in the region is partly made up by the positive net migration. To some extent the migratory surplus has in fact offset the downward trend in the population since 1975. In 2008, the resident population with foreign nationality registered in the region accounted to 83,306 persons (6.7% of the total population).

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Friuli-Venezia Giulia}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2021}}
[[File:Trieste_(28947281422).jpg|thumb|The seat of the regional government in [[Trieste]]]]

A special Italian statute of 31 January 1963 effective 16 February 1963 constituted Friuli-Venezia Giulia as an [[Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]] within the Italian Republic.

The [[Presidents of Friuli-Venezia Giulia|President of Regional Government]] is the region's head of government. Executive power is exercised by the {{ill|Regional Government of Friuli-Venezia Giulia|it|Giunta regionale del Friuli-Venezia Giulia}} and legislative power is vested in both the government and the [[Regional Council of Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Regional Council]]. In the latest regional election, which took place on 4 March 2018, [[Massimiliano Fedriga]] of the {{Lang|it|[[Lega Nord Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]|italic=no}} was elected president by a landslide.

===Administrative divisions===
Like most of the rest of Italy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia was previously divided into four [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]]: [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Province of Pordenone|Pordenone]], [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]] and [[Province of Udine|Udine]]. They were abolished on 30 September 2017, with the first three immediately ceasing activity,<ref name=Abolished>{{Cite web |date=14 December 2016 |title=Soppressione delle Province del Friuli-Venezia Giulia |lang=it |trans-title=Suppression of the Provinces of Friuli-Venezia Giulia |url=http://www.consiglio.regione.fvg.it/cms/hp/informazioni/0072.html |access-date=24 December 2021 |website=Consiglio regionale del Friuli-Venezia Giulia |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023083832/http://www.consiglio.regione.fvg.it/cms/hp/informazioni/0072.html |archive-date=23 October 2017}}</ref> while the province of Udine remained active until 22 April 2018.<ref name=FinalActivity>{{Cite web |date=16 May 2018 |title=Nomina del commissario liquidatore |lang=it |trans-title=Appointment of the liquidator commissioner |url=http://www.provincia.udine.it/notizie/nomina-del-commissario-liquidatore |access-date=20 April 2019 |website=Provincia di Udine |archive-date=4 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504011126/http://www.provincia.udine.it/notizie/nomina-del-commissario-liquidatore |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2019, they were all reactivated as "regional decentralization entities" ({{langx|it|Enti di decentramento regionale}}, or EDR) beginning on 1 July 2020.<ref name="rde">{{cite web|url=https://www.ilfriuli.it/politica/focus-sugli-enti-di-decentramento-regionale/|title=Focus sugli Enti di decentramento regionale|language=it|work=IlFriuli.it|date=22 September 2020|access-date=18 August 2023}}</ref>

In anticipation of this 2017 and 2018 abolition of the provinces in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the [[Regional Council of Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Regional Council]] created a system of 18 Intermunicipal Territorial Unions ({{langx|it|Unioni territoriali intercomunali|links=no}}, or UTI).<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 February 2015 |title=Enti locali: Approvata la proposta del piano di riordino territoriale del FV |lang=it |trans-title=Local authorities: Approved the proposal of the territorial reorganization plan of the FV |url=http://www.regione.fvg.it/rafvg/giunta/dettaglio.act;jsessionid=C58454401E9659900CAB3D9A555DAFB2?dir=/rafvg/cms/RAFVG/Giunta/Panontin/comunicati/&id=93283&ass=C03&WT.ti=Ricerca%20comunicati%20stampa |access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> The UTIs progressively took on the local services that the municipalities previously managed, extending across the larger area managed by each UTI, while also taking on some responsibilities previously managed by the provinces; this handling of "wide area local development policies" by the UTIs was conceived as a way allow more focused planning and budgeting for the 215 {{lang|it|[[Comune|comuni]]}}, divided across the 18 UTIs, than would be possible on a region-wide basis by the Regional Council.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Local development challenges and the role of "wide areas" in strategic planning.

The Regional Council also passed a statute which allows, should it desire at some future point, for the establishment of the regional capital of Trieste—with smaller surrounding towns—as a [[Metropolitan cities of Italy|metropolitan city]] administering wide area local development policies.

[[File:Quadrilingual traffic sign.jpg|thumb|A traffic sign in Italian, [[Friulan]], German and Slovene]]

===Language===
[[File:Linguistic minorities in FVG.png|thumb|300px|A map of linguistic minorities in Friuli-Venezia Giulia; areas in white are historically Venetian speaking.]]
The official languages of the region are [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Friulian language|Friulian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[German language|German]].<ref name="auto" />

[[Italian language|Italian]] is the official national language. [[Friulian language]] is also spoken in most of the region—with a few exceptions, most notably Trieste and the area around [[Monfalcone]] and [[Grado, Italy|Grado]], where a version of the [[Venetian language]] and [[Triestine dialect]] is spoken instead.{{Cn|date=August 2021}}

Venetian is also spoken in western part of the [[Province of Pordenone]], and in the [[Pordenone|city of Pordenone]] itself, due to its proximity with the [[Veneto|Veneto region]]. [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]] are more common in the countryside, while [[Italian language|standard Italian]] is the predominant language in the larger towns ([[Udine]], [[Pordenone]], [[Gorizia]]). The region is also home to Italy's [[Slovene minority in Italy|Slovene-speaking minority]].{{Cn|date=August 2021}}

===Historical flag===
A very popular symbol among the Friulian community (mostly identified with the Friulian-speaking population in the provinces of Udine, Pordenone and Gorizia and the numerous expat communities around the world) is the [[Flag of Friuli|Friulian Historical Flag]], to which the official regional flag is roughly inspired, being somehow a modern interpretation of it. The official, modern "Friuli-Venezia Giulia" flag logo was issued in 1967–1968<ref>{{Cite web |title=pending |url=http://www.consiglio.regione.fvg.it/iterdocs/Serv-LC/ITER_LEGGI/LEGISLATURA_VIII/LEGGI_APPROVATE/135_LR.pdf/ |access-date=31 October 2020 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133627/http://www.consiglio.regione.fvg.it/iterdocs/Serv-LC/ITER_LEGGI/LEGISLATURA_VIII/LEGGI_APPROVATE/135_LR.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> (and adopted in 2001) to represent the region which in 1963<ref>{{Cite web |title=pending |url=https://www.regione.fvg.it/rafvg/cms/RAFVG/GEN/amministrazione-trasparente/FOGLIA1/FOGLIA2/#:~:text=Lo%20Statuto%20Speciale%20della%20Regione,integrano%20l'ordinamento%20della%20Regione |access-date=31 October 2020 |archive-date=22 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122050607/http://www.regione.fvg.it/rafvg/cms/RAFVG/GEN/amministrazione-trasparente/FOGLIA1/FOGLIA2/#:~:text=Lo%20Statuto%20Speciale%20della%20Regione,integrano%20l'ordinamento%20della%20Regione |url-status=dead }}</ref> took the administrative setup of today.
