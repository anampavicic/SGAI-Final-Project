As of the 2020 census, it had 2,467,965 inhabitants (2,208,708 as of 2010), of whom 1,954,795 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of 5 urban districts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=China: Qīnghăi (Prefectures, Cities, Districts and Counties) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/qinghai/admin/}}</ref> The city lies in the [[Huangshui River|Huangshui River Valley]], also known as Tsongkha ([[Tibetan script|Tibetan]]: ཙོང་ཁ་), and owing to its high altitude, has a cool climate on the borderline between [[Semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid]] and dry winter [[humid continental climate|humid continental]]. 

Xining was a commercial hub along the [[Northern Silk Road]]'s [[Hexi Corridor]] for over 2000 years, and was a stronghold of the [[Han dynasty|Han]], [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties' resistance against nomadic attacks from the west. Although long a part of [[Gansu]] province, Xining was added to Qinghai in 1928. Xining holds sites of religious significance to Muslims and Buddhists, including the [[Dongguan Mosque]] and [[Kumbum Monastery]]. It is connected by the [[Qinghai–Tibet railway]] to [[Lhasa|Lhasa, Tibet]] and connected by [[Lanzhou–Xinjiang high-speed railway|a high-speed railway]] to [[Lanzhou|Lanzhou, Gansu]] and [[Ürümqi|Ürümqi, Xinjiang]].

The city is home to [[Qinghai University]], a [[comprehensive university]] and the only [[Double First-Class Construction|Double First-Class University]] in Xining.

== History ==
Xining has a history of over 2,100 years<ref>[http://www.xining.gov.cn/English/English_1.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105845/http://www.xining.gov.cn/English/English_1.html|date=September 29, 2007}}</ref> and was a chief commercial hub on the [[Hexi Corridor]] caravan route to [[Tibet]], handling especially timber, wool and salt in ancient times. The trade along the Hexi Corridor was part of a larger trade corridor along the [[Northern Silk Road]], whose use was intensified in the 1st century BC after efforts by the [[Han dynasty]] to control this route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 |title=Silk Road, North China [Northern Silk Road, North Silk Road&#93; Ancient Trackway : The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |access-date=2014-02-07}}</ref>

Under the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), a county called Linqiang was established to control the local [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang tribesmen]]. It was again a frontier county under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581–618) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) dynasties; during the 7th and early 8th centuries it was a center of constant warfare with [[Tuyuhun]] and [[Tibetan Empire|Tibet]]. In 763, it was overrun by the Tibetans and while under Tibetan control was known to the Chinese as ''Qingtang cheng'' ({{lang|zh|青唐城}}). Recovered by the [[Song dynasty]] in 1104, it received the name Xining (meaning "peace in the west") and has been the seat of a prefecture or superior prefecture under that name since that time. The founder of [[Gelug]] '''Tsongkhapa''' ([[Tibetan script|Tibetan]]: ཙོང་ཁ་པ་, meaning: "the man from [[Xining|Tsongkha]]". c. 1357–1419) was born in the 14th century, and on the site of his birthplace the [[Kumbum Monastery]] was founded in the late 16th century, establishing Xining as an important religious center for the [[Gelug]] School of Buddhists.

A major [[1927 Gulang earthquake|earthquake occurred May 22, 1927]], measuring at a [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] of 7.6. It was one of the deadliest earthquakes in China with a total count of over 40,000 deaths. It also caused large land fractures.

Xining was the extraterritorial capital of the [[Koko Nor]] territory and remained in [[Gansu]] until 1928, when it became the provincial capital of the newly established independent province of Qinghai.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WltwAAAAMAAJ&q=sichuan+reassert|title=China's inner Asian frontier: photographs of the Wulsin expedition to northwest China in 1923 : from the archives of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, and the National Geographic Society|author=Frederick Roelker Wulsin, Joseph Fletcher, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, National Geographic Society (U.S.), Peabody Museum of Salem|editor=Mary Ellen Alonso|year=1979|publisher=The Museum : distributed by Harvard University Press|edition=illustrated|page=49|isbn=0-674-11968-1|access-date=2010-06-28}}(Original from the University of Michigan)</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhe6vP66jN0C&q=They+did+not%2C+however%2C+control+political+life+in+the+province.+This+was+in+the+hands+of+the+Ma+clan+of+Hui+Muslims%2C+the+third+most+numerous+ethnic+group+after+the+Han+and+the+Tibetans.+Governor+Ma+Bufang+%2819o2-75%29+dominated+Qinghai&pg=PA351|title=Modern China: a guide to a century of change|author=Graham Hutchings|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|edition=illustrated, reprint|page=351|isbn=0-674-01240-2|access-date=2010-06-28}}</ref>

Xining was subjected to aerial bombardment by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] warplanes in 1941 during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The bombing spurred all ethnicities in Qinghai, including the local Qinghai Mongols and Qinghai Tibetans, against the Japanese.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.krzzjn.com/html/28977.html |script-title=zh:回顾1941年日机轰炸西宁：改变青海历史轨迹 - 抗战故事 - 抗日战争纪念网}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dangshi.people.com.cn/n/2013/0816/c85037-22593706.html|title = 1941：日军飞机轰炸西宁--党史频道-人民网}}</ref> The Salar Muslim General [[Han Youwen]] directed the defense of the city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xjmg.org/show.aspx?id%3D1081%26cid%3D10 |title=怀念我的父亲──韩有文 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322070922/http://www.xjmg.org/show.aspx?id=1081&cid=10 |archive-date=March 22, 2012 }}</ref><ref>http://www.kunlunpai.cn/thread-1211-1-1.html{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Xining was given municipal status in 1945.

Under the rule of Governor [[Ma Bufang]],  Xining, like the rest of Qinghai, underwent [[industrialization]] and modernization. In 1947 the USA sold Ma Bufang a piped water (sewage) system which was installed in Xining.<ref>{{cite news |title=CITY IN WEST CHINA TO GET PIPED WATER; American 'Sells' Warlord at Sining on System to Aid Health --People Suspect Clear Fluid|newspaper=THE NEW YORK TIMES|date=3 February 1947|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/02/03/archives/city-in-west-china-to-get-piped-water-american-sells-warlord-at.html|access-date=2010-11-28}}</ref> Ma Bufang also promoted education.

Since the late 1950s, when the [[Liujiaxia Dam]] and [[hydroelectric]] project came into operation in neighboring [[Gansu province]],  Xining has been linked by a high-tension electrical grid to both Liujia and Lanzhou. It also uses local [[coal]] from mines at [[Datong Hui and Tu Autonomous County|Datong County]] to the north. A modern woollen mill was installed at Xining before 1957. The city also has a leather industry and is a market for salt from the [[Qaidam]] region. During the late 1950s medium-sized iron and steelworks were built there, supplying metal to Lanzhou.

Construction of a highway to the mineral-rich [[Qaidam]] basin, and completion in 1959 a link to the Chinese rail network via [[Lanzhou]] in Gansu province, has spurred industrial development. This effort was part of a plan of the central government to rapidly exploit oil and pasturage in the Xining area beginning in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Greg Rohlf |title=Dreams of Oil and Fertile Fields |journal=Modern China |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=455–489 |publisher=Mcx.sagepub.com |date=2003-10-01 |doi=10.1177/0097700403257134 |s2cid=143975998 }}</ref>

== Geography and climate ==
Xining is located in the eastern part of [[Qinghai]] Province and lies on the [[Huangshui River]]. The four urban districts have a total area of {{convert|343|km2|abbr=on}}.

Xining is located on the eastern edge of the [[Qinghai–Tibet Plateau]] and the upper reaches of the [[Huangshui River]]. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of [[Qinghai Province]] with an average altitude of about {{convert|2,200|m}}. Human activity in the region can be traced to 2,100 years ago. During the [[Han dynasty|Western and Eastern Han dynasties]], owing to its developing [[agriculture]],  Xining was paid notice due to its economic and military significance. As well as being an important hinge between the Central Plains and the western part of China in ancient times,  Xining was an important link in the [[Silk Road]]. It continues to be an important rail and road link to the hinterlands of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau.

Xining has also been dubbed the Summer Resort Capital of China owing to its cool summer, with a borderline [[Semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'')/dry winter [[humid continental climate]] (''Dwb''). Conditions are influenced by the aridity and high altitude. Nights are cold or cool throughout the year, and the [[diurnal temperature variation]] often reaches or exceeds {{convert|15|°C-change|0}}. The monthly 24-hour average temperatures ranges from {{convert|−7.9|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|17.5|°C|1}} in July; the annual mean is {{convert|6.0|°C|1}}, still making it one of the warmest locations in Qinghai due to the low elevation by provincial standards. Rainfall falls mainly from May to September, and the area is often dry and sunny: with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 49&nbsp;percent in September to 67&nbsp;percent in November, the city receives 2,540 hours of bright sunshine per year. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|−26.6|°C|0}} to {{convert|36.5|°C|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/home.do |script-title=zh:中国气象科学数据共享服务网 |publisher=China Meteorological Administration |access-date=February 22, 2014 |archive-date=March 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302053152/http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/home.do |url-status=dead }}</ref> Snow cover is very sparse due to the dry winters.

==Education==

===Colleges and universities===
* [[Qinghai University]]
* [[Qinghai Normal University]]
* [[Qinghai University for Nationalities]]

===Private schools===
[[Xining International Academy]] is an English-language international school.

==Transportation==
[[File:Street of Xining.jpg|thumb|Jianguo Avenue in Xining, prior to 2013 reconstruction of the railway station]]
Xining is situated in a fertile mountain basin in the valley of the Huangshui (river), a tributary of the Yellow River, that acts as a river port. The city lies about {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Lanzhou]], the capital of [[Gansu]] province, on what was traditionally the main trade route from [[Northern and southern China|northern China]] into [[Tibet]] and the [[Qaidam Basin]]. These routes are now followed by modern [[highway]]s.

===Railway===
[[File:Xining railway station indoors.jpg|thumb|Inside the [[Xining railway station]]]]
Since 1959 [[Xining railway station|Xining station]] has been connected by the [[Lanzhou–Qinghai Railway]] to [[Rail transport in China|China's railway network]]. Later, this railway was extended into the Qaidam area via [[Haiyan County, Qinghai|Haiyan]] near [[Qinghai Lake]] to [[Golmud]], and, since 2006, to [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]. (See the [[Qinghai–Tibet Railway]]).

The second major railway serving Xining is the [[Lanzhou–Xinjiang High-Speed Railway]], opened in December 2014. When first opened, it just provided high-speed train service to Lanzhou and [[Urumqi]] (and points in between). With the opening of the [[Baoji–Lanzhou high-speed railway]] on July 9, 2017, it has been connected to the rest of the nation's high-speed rail network.

Unlike many other Chinese cities, where the conventional and high-speed trains stop at different train stations, [[Xining railway station]] is served by both types of trains. Thus it can be used as a transfer point for e.g. a passenger traveling from [[Xinjiang]] to [[Tibet]].

===Air===
[[Xining Caojiapu International Airport]] serves the area with regularly scheduled passenger flights to major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi'an, and Wuhan.

===Highway===
* [[China National Highway 214]]
*[[China National Highway 227]]
*[[China National Highway 315]]
*[[G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway]]

== Food ==
{{see|Qinghai cuisine}}
Xining's cuisine is distinct from other Chinese cities and mainly uses food products native to the area.

Local specialties include: Feng'er Liji (a round lamb tenderloin), Danbai Chongcao Ji (a medicine cuisine made of chicken, Chinese [[caterpillar fungus]] and eggs), and Jinyu Facai (pork wrapped in flagelliform [[nostoc]] and shaped as a goldfish).

There are also many small restaurants offering noodles. Gan Ban is a very common noodle dish. Perhaps Mian Pian, which means "noodle leaves" is the most common noodle plate among the Qinghai people. On the streets, many Muslims sell spicy [[Shish kebab|lamb brochettes]]. Due to the cold climate, residents of Xining are also fond of strong spirits;  Xining has the reputation of being one of the regions of heaviest alcohol consumption in China.{{cn|date=April 2023}}
