'''Santa Ana''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for {{gloss|[[Saint Anne]]}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Orange County, California]], United States. Located in the [[Greater Los Angeles]] region of [[Southern California]], the city's population was 310,227 at the 2020 census. As of 2023, Santa Ana is the third most populous city in Orange County (after [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] and Irvine), the [[List of largest cities in California by population|14th-most populous city in California]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|65th most populous city in the United States]]. Santa Ana is a major regional economic and cultural hub for the [[Orange Coast]].

In 1810, the Spanish governor of California granted [[Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana]] to [[José Antonio Yorba]]. Following the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the Yorba family [[ranchos of California|rancho]] was enlarged, becoming one of the largest and most valuable in the region and home to a diverse [[Californio]] community. Following the American [[Conquest of California]], the rancho was sold to the [[Sepúlveda family]], who subsequently lost their [[California Land Act of 1851|land claim]]. In 1869, [[William H. Spurgeon]] then purchased the rancho and formally founded the modern city of Santa Ana.

Approximately four-fifths Hispanic or Latino, Santa Ana has been characterized by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the "face of a new California, a state where Latinos have more influence in everyday life—electorally, culturally and demographically—than almost anywhere else in the country."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/california-latino-voters.html|title=This City Is 78% Latino, and the Face of a New California|last1=Nagourney|first1=Adam|date=October 11, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=January 17, 2020|last2=Medina|first2=Jennifer|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===Spanish and Mexican eras===
[[File:Andrés Sepúlveda.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Sepúlveda family of California|José Andrés Sepúlveda]], a famed [[Californio]] vaquero, purchased most [[Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana]], but lost his [[California Land Act of 1851|land claim]] after the U.S. [[Conquest of California]].]]
After the 1769 expedition of [[Gaspar de Portolá]] out of [[Mexico City]], then capital of [[New Spain]], Friar [[Junípero Serra]] named the area '''Vallejo de Santa Ana''' (Valley of [[Saint Anne]], or [[Santa Ana Valley]]). On November 1, 1776, [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] was established within this valley.

In 1810, the first year of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], [[Jose Antonio Yorba]], a sergeant of the Spanish army, was granted land that he called [[Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana]]. Yorba's rancho included the lands where the cities of [[Olive, California|Olive]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[Yorba Linda]], [[Villa Park, California|Villa Park]], Santa Ana, [[Tustin]], [[Costa Mesa]] and unincorporated [[El Modena]], and [[Santa Ana Heights]], are today. This rancho was the only land grant in Orange County granted under [[New Spain|Spanish Rule]]. Surrounding land grants in Orange County were granted after Mexican Independence by the new government.

After the [[Mexican-American War]] ended in 1848, [[Alta California]] became part of the [[United States]] and American settlers arrived in this area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Emeryville's History |url=https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/659/Americans-Arrive-1840s-to-1890s |website=City of Emeryville |access-date=October 1, 2021}}</ref>

===Post-Conquest era===
Santa Ana was listed as a township of Los Angeles County in the 1860 and 1870 census, with an area encompassing most of what is now northern and central Orange County. It had a population of 756 in 1860 and 880 in 1870. The Anaheim district was enumerated separately from Santa Ana in 1870.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lawesterners.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/249-BI_249.pdf|title=What a Difference a Decade Makes: Ethnic and Racial Demographic Change in Los Angeles County during the 1860s |author=Paul R.

Claimed in 1869 by [[Kentuckian]] [[William H. Spurgeon]] on land obtained from the descendants of [[Jose Antonio Yorba]], Santa Ana was incorporated as a city in 1886 with a population of 2000 and in 1889 became the seat of the newly formed [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].

In 1877, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a branch line from [[Los Angeles]] to Santa Ana, which offered free right of way, land for a depot, and $10,000 in cash to the railroad in exchange for terminating the line in Santa Ana and not neighboring [[Tustin]]. In 1887, the [[California Central Railway]] (which became a subsidiary of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] the following year) broke the Southern Pacific's local monopoly on rail travel, offering service between Los Angeles and [[San Diego]] by way of Santa Ana as a major intermediate station.

In 1890, whites made up 71 percent of the city's population, most of whom migrated to Santa Ana from [[Confederate States of America|confederate states]] following the [[American Civil War]] in search of real estate ventures and other economic opportunities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=González |first=Erualdo R. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/971613305 |title=Latino city : urban planning, politics, and the grassroots |date=2017 |isbn=978-1-317-59023-1 |location=Abingdon, Oxon |pages=17–19 |oclc=971613305}}</ref>

Santa Ana was the home of the original [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn L. Martin aviation company]], founded in 1912 before merging with the [[Wright Company]] in 1916. Later, [[Glenn Luther Martin]] created a second company of the same name in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] which eventually merged with the [[Lockheed Corporation]] to form the largest defense contractor in the world, [[Lockheed Martin]].<ref name="santaanahistory.com">[http://www.santaanahistory.com/local_history.html Featuring Historical Information of Santa Ana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113254/http://www.santaanahistory.com/local_history.html |date=March 6, 2013 }}.

Although there was a significant wave of Mexican migration to the city following the 1910 [[Mexican Revolution]], the city remained majority white in 1939.<ref name=":0" />

During [[World War II]], the [[Santa Ana Army Air Base]] was built as a training center for the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. The base was responsible for continued population growth in Santa Ana and the rest of Orange County as many veterans moved to the area to raise families after the end of the war.<ref name="OCR 2011/03/10" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/SantaAnaAAB.html|title=Historic California Posts: Santa Ana Army Air Base|website=MilitaryMuseum.org|access-date=September 6, 2013}}</ref>

Santa Ana was at the center of Orange County's economic boom in the 1950s with its agricultural and defense industries. However, most of this prosperity was only experienced by the city's white residents, while Latinos did not similarly benefit. Instead, [[economic inequality]] between the two groups rapidly increased during this time.<ref name=":0" />

In 1958, the [[Honer Plaza]] and [[Bullock's]] [[MainPlace Mall|Fashion Square]] malls opened and would supplant Downtown Santa Ana, with its department stores such as [[Rankin's]], [[Montgomery Ward|Ward's]], [[Penney's]] and [[Buffums]]. Fashion Square was completely renovated and became MainPlace Mall in 1987.

=== ''Latino'' city ===
[[File:Julia Lathrop Junior High School, Santa Ana, Nov. 1932 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Revival style]] Lathrop Jr. High School, demolished 1970.]]
By the 1970s, Santa Ana was becoming an increasingly [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] city, with [[white flight]] to surrounding suburbs coinciding with the city's downtown becoming increasingly frequented by Latinos. This changed perceptions of the city and its economic value, with property values dropping significantly by 1974, while surrounding cities of [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], and [[Villa Park, California|Villa Park]] increased in value.<ref name=":0" />

Santa Ana entered the 1980s as a city of equal numbers of whites and Latinos. What had been the white commercial center of the city, Fourth Street, was now a street of Latino businesses and character. Latino immigrant and working-class families could now be found in every neighborhood of the city, rather than in just a few [[ethnic enclave]]s, as they were previously. ''Santa Ana'' became more often referred to as ''Santana'' and ''Fourth Street'' as ''La Cuatro.''<ref name=":0" />

Having been a [[charter city]] since November 11, 1952, the citizens of Santa Ana amended the charter in November 1988 to provide for the direct election of the Mayor who until that point had been appointed from the council membership. [[Miguel A. Pulido]] was the first mayor of Latino descent in the city's history and the first Mayor directly elected by the voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-02-26-me-1944-story.html|title=City's Latinos on the Grow : Majority: Santa Ana's Hispanics make up 65% of the population and have recorded solid gains, but some still say they are ignored by City Hall.|first1=Lily |last1=Eng |first2=Bob |last2=Schwartz |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 26, 1991|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref>

Since the 1980s, Santa Ana has been characterized by an effort to revitalize the [[Downtown National Register District|downtown area]] which had declined in influence, even as it had become a dynamic commercial and entertainment center for working-class Latinos. The Santa Ana Artist's Village was created around [[Cal State Fullerton]]'s [[CSUF Grand Central Art Center|Grand Central Art Center]] to attract artists and young professionals to live-work lofts and new businesses. The process continued into 2009 with the reopening of the historic [[Yost Theater]].<ref>[http://soundcheck.freedomblogging.com/tag/yost-theater/ Yost Theater | Soundcheck] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120714101821/http://soundcheck.freedomblogging.com/tag/yost-theater/ |date=July 14, 2012 }}.

Despite strong Latino political representation, gentrification efforts have increasingly displaced the Mexican immigrant presence in the downtown area of the city in favor of outsiders. Primarily [[Spanish-speaking]] businesses that served immigrant populations have been demolished in favor of arts projects to draw in outside investment, which bring clientele who further question why Spanish-speaking businesses are present, leading to a cycle of displacement.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sarmiento |first=Carolina |date=2022 |title=Not diverse enough?

Residents formed a social movement to address [[Lead|lead concentrations]] in lower-income areas of the city.

Santa Ana is nested on flat, low-lying plains with little land elevation change. Running through the west end of the city is the mostly [[River engineering#Channelization|channelized]] [[Santa Ana River]], which is also largely seasonal due to the construction of the [[Prado Dam]] and [[Seven Oaks Dam]]. The river has caused several severe floods in the 20th century, and is a continued threat despite the existence of the dams.

The core of the city is the downtown area, which contains both retail and housing, as well as the [[Santa Ana Civic Center]], which is a dense campus of administrative buildings for both the city and the county of Orange. The civic center is also home to the [[Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse (California)|Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse]]. Several historic homes dating from the late 1800s can be found as well, and their preservation is a key issue as development of the downtown area continues.<ref>[http://www.santaanahistory.com/dr_howe-waffle.html Featuring Historical Information of Santa Ana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326214347/http://www.santaanahistory.com/dr_howe-waffle.html |date=March 26, 2013 }}.

Santa Ana is the corporate headquarters of several companies, including [[Behr Paint]], [[First American Corporation]], [[Greenwood & Hall]], [[Ingram Micro]], [[SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union]], [[STEC, Inc.|STEC]], [[TTM Technologies]], [[Kern's (beverage company)|Kern's]], and [[Wahoo's Fish Taco]]. It also houses major regional headquarters for the [[Xerox]] corporation, [[Ultimate Software]], and [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]]. Nonprofits based in Santa Ana include [[Open Doors]].

One of Santa Ana's most notable businesses is the [[Rickenbacker]] musical instrument company, whose [[electric guitar]]s and [[bass guitar]]s earned fame in the hands of many [[rock and roll]] legends.

Then [[Glenn L. Martin Company]], a precursor to [[Lockheed Martin]], was founded in Santa Ana in 1912 before merging with the [[Wright Company]] in 1916.
