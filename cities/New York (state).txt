'''New York''', also called '''New York State''',{{efn|To distinguish it from its largest city, [[New York City]]}} is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Northeastern United States]].

New York has a [[Geography of New York (state)|varied geography]]. The southeastern part of the state, known as [[Downstate New York|Downstate]], encompasses [[New York City]], the United States's largest city; [[Long Island]], the nation's most populous island; and the suburbs and wealthy enclaves of the lower [[Hudson Valley]].

The east–west [[Mohawk River]] Valley bisects the more mountainous regions of Upstate and flows into the north–south [[Hudson River]] valley near the [[List of U.S. state capitals|state capital]] of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. [[Western New York]], home to the cities of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], is part of the [[Great Lakes region]] and borders [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Erie]]. [[Central New York]] is anchored by the city of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]; between the central and western parts of the state, New York is dominated by the [[Finger Lakes]], a popular tourist destination. To the south, along the state border with [[Pennsylvania]], the [[Southern Tier]] sits atop the [[Allegheny Plateau]], representing the northernmost reaches of [[Appalachia]].

New York was one of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] that went on to form the United States.

Many of the Wampanoag and Mohican peoples were caught up in [[King Philip's War]], a joint effort of many [[New England]] tribes to push Europeans off their land.

In 1524, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] explorer in the service of the [[French crown]], explored the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[North America]] between the [[Carolinas]] and [[Newfoundland]], including [[New York Harbor]] and [[Narragansett Bay]].

The success of the [[patroon]]ship of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony. The English captured the colony during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and governed it as the [[Province of New York]]. The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in 1673 during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] (1672–1674) and renamed New Orange.

This included the right to [[No taxation without representation|representative government]].

Approximately a third of the battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]] took place in New York; the first major one and largest of the entire war was the [[Battle of Long Island]], also known as the Battle of Brooklyn, in August 1776. After their victory, the British occupied present-day New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]]. On the notorious British [[HMS Jersey (1736)|prison ships]] of [[Wallabout Bay]], more American combatants died than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined.

As allies of the British, the Iroquois were forced out of New York, although they had not been part of treaty negotiations. They resettled in Canada after the war and were given land grants by the Crown. In the treaty settlement, the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States. Because New York made a treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval, some of the land purchases have been subject to land claim suits since the late 20th century by the federally recognized tribes.

New York City was the national capital under the [[Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], the first national government.

Hamilton led the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]] that called for the [[Philadelphia Convention]], which drafted the United States Constitution, in which he also took part. The new government was to be a strong [[Federation|federal]] national government to replace the relatively weaker [[confederation]] of individual states.

Improving transportation, it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York. After 1850, railroads largely replaced the canal.<ref>Peter L. Bernstein, ''Wedding of the waters: The Erie Canal and the making of a great nation'' (2005).</ref>

The connectivity offered by the canal, and subsequently the railroads, led to an economic boom across the entire state through the 1950s. Major corporations that got their start in New York during this time include [[American Express]], [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]], [[Bristol Myers Squibb]], [[Carrier Global|Carrier]], [[Chase Bank|Chase]], [[General Electric]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[IBM]], [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]], [[Macy's]], [[NBC]], [[Pfizer]], [[Random House]], [[RCA]], [[Tiffany & Co.]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[Western Union]], and [[Xerox]].

New York City was a major [[port|ocean port]] and had extensive traffic importing cotton from the [[American South|South]] and exporting manufacturing goods. Nearly half of the state's exports were related to cotton. Southern cotton factors, planters and bankers visited so often that they had favorite hotels.<ref>Robert Greenhalgh Albion, ''The rise of New York port (1815–1860)'' (1939).</ref> At the same time, activism for [[abolitionism]] was strong upstate, where some communities provided stops on the [[Underground Railroad]]. Upstate, and New York City, gave strong support for the [[American Civil War]], in terms of finances, volunteer soldiers, and supplies. The state provided more than 370,000 soldiers to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies. Over 53,000 New Yorkers died in service, roughly one of every seven who served. However, Irish draft riots in 1862 were a significant embarrassment.<ref>Ernest A. McKay, ''The Civil War and New York City'' (1990).</ref><ref>Frederick Phisterer, ''New York in the War of the Rebellion, 1861 To 1865'' (1890), p. 88.</ref>

====Immigration====
{{Further|Ellis Island}}
[[File:Ellis Island immigration footage.ogg|thumb|Scenes at the Immigration Depot and a nearby dock on [[Ellis Island]] in May 1906]]
Since the early 19th century, New York City has been the largest [[port of entry]] for [[Immigration to the United States|legal immigration into the United States]]. In the United States, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government. Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the Hudson and [[East River]]s, in the eventual [[Lower Manhattan]]. On May 4, 1847, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110063703/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archive-date=November 10, 2013 |title=Castle Garden as An Immigrant Depot:1855–1890 |publisher=National Park Service|access-date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

The first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in 1855 at [[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden]], a converted [[War of 1812]] era fort located within what is now [[Battery Park]], at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from [[quarantine]]. Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890, when the federal government assumed control over immigration. During that period, more than eight million immigrants passed through its doors (two of every three U.S. immigrants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm |title=Castle Clinton |publisher=National Park Service|date=August 22, 2013 |access-date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

When the federal government assumed control, it established the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Bureau of Immigration]], which chose the three-acre (1.2 ha) Ellis Island in [[Upper New York Bay|Upper New York Harbor]] for an entry depot. Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot. It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], via a short ferry ride. While the island was being developed and expanded via [[land reclamation]], the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery.<ref>Vincent J. Cannato: ''American Passage: The History of Ellis Island''. p.50: Harper Collins (2009) {{ISBN|0060742739}}</ref>

Ellis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the [[Immigration Act of 1924|National Origins Act]] was passed in 1924, reducing immigration. After that date, the only immigrants to pass through were [[displaced persons]] or war [[refugees]]. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954, when the last person detained on the island, [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] seaman Arne Peterssen, was released. He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10:15{{spaces}}a.m. Manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship.

More than 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. More than 100 million Americans across the United States can trace their [[ancestry]] to these immigrants. Ellis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between the State of New York and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it. The issue was officially settled in 1998 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] which ruled that the original {{convert|3.3|acre|adj=on}} island was New York state territory and that the balance of the {{convert|27.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|author=Linda Greenhouse|first=|date=May 27, 1998|title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html|url-status=live|access-date=September 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113042835/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html|archive-date=January 13, 2021}}</ref> In May 1964, Ellis Island was added to the [[National Park Service]] by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and is still owned by the federal government as part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. In 1990, Ellis Island was opened to the public as a museum of immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm |title=Statue Of Liberty National Monument |publisher=Nps.gov |access-date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

On September 11, 2001, two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], and [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|the towers collapsed]]. [[7 World Trade Center (1987–2001)|7 World Trade Center]] also collapsed due to damage from fires. The other buildings of the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and demolished soon thereafter. The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage and resulted in the deaths of 2,753 victims, including 147 aboard the two planes. Since September{{spaces}}11, most of Lower Manhattan has been restored. In the years since, over 7,000 rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life-threatening illnesses, and some have died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_yMv9jixDZNCnW9DXgTYhKJ|title=Charting post-9/11 deaths|first=Susan|last=Edelman|access-date=January 22, 2012|date=January 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Statistics|url=http://neverforgetproject.com/statistics|access-date=June 27, 2020|website=The Never Forget Project}}</ref>

====Hurricane Sandy (2012)====
{{Main|Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York}}
On October 29 and 30, 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused extensive destruction of the state's shorelines, ravaging portions of New York City, [[Long Island]], and southern Westchester with record-high [[storm surge]], with severe flooding and high winds causing [[power outage]]s for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, and leading to [[gasoline]] shortages and disruption of [[mass transit]] systems. The storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing [[seawall]]s and other [[coastal management|coastal barriers]] around the shorelines of New York City and Long Island to minimize the risk from another such future event. Such risk is considered highly probable due to [[global warming]] and [[sea level rise|rising sea levels]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jeff Stone|author2=Maria Gallucci|date=October 29, 2014|title=Hurricane Sandy Anniversary 2014: Fortifying New York—How Well Armored Are We For The Next Superstorm?|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/hurricane-sandy-anniversary-2014-fortifying-new-york-how-well-armored-are-we-next-1711729|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731200955/http://www.ibtimes.com/hurricane-sandy-anniversary-2014-fortifying-new-york-how-well-armored-are-we-next-1711729|archive-date=July 31, 2020|access-date=July 23, 2015|work=International Business Times|name-list-style=amp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eenews.net/public/climatewire/2012/11/15/1|title=ADAPTATION: Political support for a sea wall in New York Harbor begins to form|author=Robert S.

In contrast with New York City's urban landscape, the vast majority of the state's geographic area is dominated by [[meadow]]s, [[forest]]s, rivers, farms, mountains, and lakes. Most of the southern part of the state rests on the [[Allegheny Plateau]], which extends from the [[southeastern United States]] to the [[Catskill Mountains]]; the section in the State of New York is known as the [[Southern Tier]]. The rugged [[Adirondack Mountains]], with vast tracts of wilderness, lie west of the [[Lake Champlain Valley]]. The [[Great Appalachian Valley]] dominates eastern New York and contains Lake Champlain Valley as its northern half and the [[Hudson Valley]] as its southern half within the state.

The state's borders include a water boundary in (clockwise from the west) two [[Great Lakes]] ([[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario]], which are connected by the [[Niagara River]]); the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]], with New York and Ontario sharing the [[Thousand Islands]] [[archipelago]] within the Saint Lawrence River, while most of its border with Quebec is on land; it shares [[Lake Champlain]] with the [[New England]] state of [[Vermont]]; the New England state of [[Massachusetts]] has mostly a land border; New York extends into [[Long Island Sound]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], sharing a water border with [[Rhode Island]], while [[Connecticut]] has land and sea borders. Except for areas near the [[New York Harbor]] and the Upper [[Delaware River]], New York has a mostly land border with two [[Mid-Atlantic states]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. New York is the only state that borders both the Great Lakes and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

====Drainage====
The [[Hudson River]] begins near [[Lake Tear of the Clouds]] and flows south through the eastern part of the state, without draining Lakes [[Lake George (lake), New York|George]] or [[Lake Champlain|Champlain]]. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the [[Richelieu River]] and then ultimately the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The western section of the state is drained by the [[Allegheny River]] and rivers of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River]] systems. [[Niagara Falls]] is shared between New York and Ontario as it flows on the Niagara River from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. The Delaware River Basin Compact, signed in 1961 by New York, New Jersey, [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and the federal government, regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/compact.pdf|title=Delaware River Basin Commission|publisher=The State of New Jersey|access-date=April 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of New York (state)}}
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], most of New York has a [[humid continental climate]], though New York City and Long Island have a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref name=NYClimate>{{cite web|url=http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412104922/http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archive-date=April 12, 2008|title=Climate of New York|publisher=New York State Climate Office—Cornell University|access-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref> Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold, dry one from the northwest. Downstate New York (comprising New York City, Long Island, and lower portions of the Hudson Valley) have rather hot summers with some periods of high humidity and cold, damp winters which are relatively mild compared to temperatures in Upstate New York, due to the downstate region's lower elevation, proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and relatively lower [[latitude]].

[[Upstate New York]] experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy [[lake-effect snow]]s, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice. The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier. Buffalo and its metropolitan area are described as climate change havens for their weather pattern in Western New York.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Will Buffalo Become a Climate Change Haven?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/the-consequences-of-being-a-climate-refuge-city|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131235124/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/the-consequences-of-being-a-climate-refuge-city|archive-date=January 31, 2021|access-date=June 27, 2020|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|date=December 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=García|first=Beatriz|date=December 16, 2019|title=Why Buffalo is the best U.S. city for climate refugees|url=https://aldianews.com/articles/cultura/environment/why-buffalo-best-us-city-climate-refugees/57108|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201004537/https://aldianews.com/articles/cultura/environment/why-buffalo-best-us-city-climate-refugees/57108|archive-date=February 1, 2021|access-date=June 27, 2020|website=AL DÍA News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Move to Buffalo?

===Regions===
{{Main|List of regions of the United States#New York}}
Due to its long history, New York has several overlapping and often conflicting definitions of regions within the state. The regions are also not fully definable due to the colloquial use of regional labels. The [[Empire State Development Corporation|New York State Department of Economic Development]] provides two distinct definitions of these regions. It divides the state into ten economic regions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pad.human.cornell.edu/census2010/reports/2010%20race%20age%20sex%20New%20York.pdf |title=Age/sex/race in New York State: Based on Census 2010 |access-date=May 15, 2012}}</ref> which approximately correspond to terminology used by residents:

In 2014, the [[Pew Research Center]] released a study of New York's religious population, which found that majority, 60%, are [[Christianity|Christian]]. Christians are followed by the irreligious (27%), [[Judaism]] (7%), [[Islam]] (2%), [[Eastern religions|Buddhism and Hinduism]] (1% each), and other faiths (0.5%).<ref name="Pew-2020">{{Cite web|title=Religion in America: U.S. Religious Data, Demographics and Statistics|url=https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project}}</ref> Through another study by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] in 2020, the majority of New York's religious or spiritual population were 67% Christian, followed by the irreligious (22%), Judaism (4%), Islam (2%), Buddhism and Hinduism (1% each), and other faiths (1%).<ref>{{Cite web |title=PRRI – American Values Atlas |url=https://ava.prri.org/#religious/2020/States/religion/m/US-NY |access-date=July 9, 2022 |website=ava.prri.org}}</ref>

Prior to the 1800s, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sects dominated the religious life of New York, although religion did not play as large a role in the public life of colonial-era [[New Netherland]] as it did in [[New England]], with its Puritan population.<ref name="www.city-data.com">{{cite web|title=Religions|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/New-York-Religions.html|access-date=November 25, 2018}}</ref> Historically, New York served as the foundation for [[Burned-over district|new Christian denominations]] in the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Non-Western Christian traditions and non-Christian religions did not grow for much of the state's history because immigration was predominantly from [[Western Europe]] (favored by the quotas in federal immigration law). The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] removed the quotas, allowing for the growth of other religious groups.

The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] is the largest Christian denomination in New York as of 2014's study (31%). The largest Roman Catholic diocese is the [[Latin Church]]'s [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archdiocese of New York]]. The largest Eastern Catholic diocese is the [[Ruthenian Catholic Eparchy of Passaic]] of the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]]. The [[United Methodist Church]] was the largest [[Mainline Protestant]] denomination and second-largest overall, followed by the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the U.S.]] and other [[Continuing Anglican movement|Continuing Anglican]] bodies. The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], and [[American Baptist Churches USA]] were the following largest Mainline denominations. Mainline Protestants together made up 11% of Christians in the state as of 2014.<ref name="Pew-2020" /> In Evangelical Protestantism the [[Baptists]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational Protestants]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] were the largest groups. The [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention (USA)]] and [[Progressive National Baptist Convention]] were the largest historically black Protestant churches in New York. Roughly 10% of Christians in New York identify as Evangelical Protestants as of 2014.<ref name="Pew-2020" /> Additionally, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodox]] collectively comprised 1% of the religious demographic alongside [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[List of Christian denominations|other Christians]]; the Orthodox Christians in 2020's study made up 1% of the population, and Jehovah's Witnesses grew to 1% of the population as well.

According to the Pew Research Center, non-Christian religions account for 12% of New York state's population.<ref name="Pew-2020" /> Judaism is the second-largest religion as of 2014 and 2020.

New York has one of the oldest and most extensive transportation infrastructures in the country. Engineering challenges posed by the complex terrain of the state and the unique infrastructural issues of New York City brought on by urban crowding have had to be overcome perennially. Population expansion of the state has followed the path of the early waterways, first the [[Hudson River]] and [[Mohawk River]], then the [[Erie Canal]]. In the 19th century, railroads were constructed along the river valleys, followed by the [[New York State Thruway]] in the 20th century.

Accessed July 19, 2015.</ref> In Buffalo, the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] runs the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] light-rail system; in Rochester, the [[Rochester Subway]] operated from 1927 until 1956, but fell into disuse as state and federal investment went to highways.

===Airports===
Portions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to [[airport terminal|terminals]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and to the underground New York City Subway system.

The Government of New York embodies the governmental structure of the State of New York as established by the [[New York State Constitution]]. It is composed of three branches: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Branches of Government in New York State|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/branches-government-new-york-state|access-date=November 28, 2022|website=New York State Senate|date=March 25, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[Governor of New York|governor]] is the state's chief executive and is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor]]. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the [[New York Attorney General|attorney general]] and the [[New York State Comptroller|comptroller]]. The [[Secretary of State of New York|secretary of state]], formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the governor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=2021 New York Laws EXC - Executive Article 6 - Department of State 90 - Department of State; Secretary of State.|url=https://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2021/exc/article-6/90/|access-date=November 28, 2022|website=Justia}}</ref>

The [[New York State Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The state assembly consists of 150 members, while the state senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the governor's power to [[veto]] a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the legislature if there is a [[two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each house. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/branches-government-new-york-state|title=Branches of Government in New York State &#124; NYSenate.gov|website=www.nysenate.gov}}</ref>
[[File:NYSCourtofAppeals1.JPG|thumb|The [[New York Court of Appeals]] is the highest court of the [[Judiciary of New York (state)|New York judiciary]]]]

The highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]] is the [[New York County Court|County Court]] (or the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in New York City). The New York Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], traffic ticket cases, and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases.

The [[administrative divisions of New York|state is divided]] into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are [[municipal corporation]]s with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and [[New York state public-benefit corporations]], frequently known as ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Each municipal corporation is granted varying [[home rule]] powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 [[Indian reservation]]s. There have been several movements regarding [[Partition and secession in New York|secession from the state of New York]]. Proposals have included a state of [[Long Island]], consisting of everything on the island outside New York City; a state called Niagara, the [[Western New York|western counties]] of the state of New York; the northern counties of the state of New York called [[Upstate New York]]; making the city of New York a state; a proposal for a new [[Peconic County]] on eastern Long Island; and for the borough of [[Staten Island]] to secede from New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rattiner|first=Dan|date=October 16, 2020|title=Peconic: The County Is Named, We Have a Flag and Enough People|url=https://www.danspapers.com/2020/10/peconic-the-county-is-named-we-have-a-flag-and-we-enough-people/|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=Dan's Papers}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=i_beebe|date=December 9, 2019|title=Staten Island keeps thinking of seceding|url=https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/staten-island-keeps-thinking-seceding.html|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=City & State NY|archive-date=December 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201211011227/https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/staten-island-keeps-thinking-seceding.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Capital punishment===
{{Main|Capital punishment in New York (state)}}
[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]], but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v. LaValle]]'' that it violated the [[New York Constitution|state constitution]]. The remaining death sentence was commuted by the court to [[life imprisonment]] in 2007, in ''People v. John Taylor'', and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from Governor [[David Paterson]]. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963. Legislative efforts to amend the statute have failed, and death sentences are no longer sought at the state level, though certain crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government are subject to the [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/NEW%20YORK.htm|title=New York Executions|date=October 25, 2005|access-date=April 9, 2009|author=Rob Gallagher|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528081537/http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/NEW%2520YORK.htm|archive-date=May 28, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07242008/news/regionalnews/gov_pulls_switch_on_death_cell_121295.htm|title=Gov Pulls Switch on Death Cell|date=July 24, 2008|work=New York Post|author=Scott, Brendan|access-date=April 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Powell, Michael|title=In N.Y., Lawmakers Vote Not to Reinstate Capital Punishment|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47871-2005Apr12.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 13, 2005|access-date=April 11, 2008}}</ref>

The state has a strong imbalance of payments with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. According to the [[New York State Comptroller]], the State of New York received 91 cents in services for every $1 it sent in taxes to the U.S. federal government in the 2013 [[fiscal year]]; New York ranked in 46th place in the federal balance of payments to the state on a per capita basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York's Balance of Payments in the Federal Budget—Federal Fiscal Year 2013|author=[[Thomas P.

New York City, as well as the state's other major urban locales, are significant Democratic strongholds. Rural portions of upstate New York, however, are generally more conservative than large cities and tend to favor [[Republican Party (New York)|Republicans]]. Heavily populated suburban areas downstate, such as Westchester County and Long Island, were solidly Republican until the 1990s, but have since shifted to primarily supporting the Democratic Party.

New York City is the most important source of [[political fundraising]] in the United States for both major parties. Four of the top five [[ZIP Code]]s in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan.

Bush]] and [[Al Gore]].<ref>{{cite news |title=2006 Election Overview: Top Zip codes |author=Opensecrets.org |date=May 16, 2005 |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topzips.asp?cycle=2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302012922/https://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topzips.asp?cycle=2004 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 2, 2006 |access-date=July 19, 2006}}</ref>

The State of New York has the distinction of being the home state for both major-party nominees in three [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]]. The [[1904 United States presidential election|1904 presidential election]] saw former [[New York Governor]] and incumbent President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] face [[Alton B.

Roosevelt]], following in his cousin Theodore's footsteps as former New York Governor and incumbent president running for re-election against the then-incumbent New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], former [[United States Senator]] from New York [[Hillary Clinton]], a resident of [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]], was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee.
