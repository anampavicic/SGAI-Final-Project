'''Gateshead''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|t|s|(|h|)|ɛ|d}}) is a town in the [[Gateshead Metropolitan Borough]] of [[Tyne and Wear]], England. It is on the [[River Tyne]]'s southern bank. The town's attractions include the twenty metre tall [[Angel of the North]] sculpture on the town's southern outskirts, [[The Glasshouse International Centre for Music]] and the [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]]. The town shares the [[Gateshead Millennium Bridge|Millennium Bridge]], [[Tyne Bridge]] and multiple other bridges with [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[County Durham]], under the [[Local Government Act 1888]] the town was made a [[county borough]], meaning it was administered independently of the [[county council]].<ref name=gBoroughHist1974/>

In the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2021 Census]], the town had a population of 196,151.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Custom report - Nomis - Official Census and Labour Market Statistics |url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021/report?compare=E08000037 |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=www.nomisweb.co.uk}}</ref>

==History==
===Name origins===
Gateshead is first mentioned in Latin translation in [[Bede|Bede's]] ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' as ''ad caput caprae'' ("at the goat's head"). This interpretation is consistent with the later English attestations of the name, among them ''Gatesheued'' ({{Circa|1190}}), literally "goat's head" but in the context of a place-name meaning 'headland or hill frequented by (wild) goats'. Although other derivations have been mooted, it is this that is given by the standard authorities.<ref>Bethany Fox, ''The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland'', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), {{cite web |url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html |title=Fox—The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland |access-date=9 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20180111041001/http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html |archive-date=11 January 2018 }} (appendix at {{cite web |url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html |title=Fox—P-Celtic Place-Names—Appendix |access-date=23 May 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509072208/http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html |archive-date=9 May 2016 }}).</ref>

A [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] predecessor, named with the element ''*gabro-'', 'goat' (c.f. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gafr''), may underlie the name.<ref name="pnnd">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028042996|last1=Mawer |first1=Allen |title=The Place-names of Northumberland and Durham |publisher=CUP Archive|date=1920 |location=Cambridge |page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028042996/page/n135 92] }}</ref> Gateshead might have been the [[Roman-British]] fort of ''Gabrosentum''.<ref name="pnnd" />

===Early===
There has been a settlement on the Gateshead side of the River Tyne, around the old river crossing where the [[Swing Bridge, River Tyne|Swing Bridge]] now stands, since Roman times.

The first recorded mention of Gateshead is in the writings of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] who referred to an Abbot of Gateshead called Utta in 623. In 1068 [[William the Conqueror]] defeated the forces of [[Edgar the Ætheling]] and [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm]] king of Scotland ([[Shakespeare]]'s [[Malcolm (Macbeth)|Malcolm]]) on Gateshead Fell (now [[Low Fell]] and [[Sheriff Hill]]).

During medieval times Gateshead was under the jurisdiction of the [[Bishop of Durham]]. At this time the area was largely forest with some agricultural land. The forest was the subject of Gateshead's first charter, granted in the 12th century by [[Hugh du Puiset]], Bishop of Durham. An alternative spelling may be "Gatishevede", as seen in a legal record, dated 1430.<ref>Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; CP 40 / 677; National Archives; {{cite web |url=http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no677/aCP40no677fronts/IMG_0752.htm |title=AALT Page |access-date=28 January 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518060628/http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no677/aCP40no677fronts/IMG_0752.htm |archive-date=18 May 2013 }}; last entry on the image, the home of William Philypson, a tanner.</ref>

===Industrial revolution===
Throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]] the population of Gateshead expanded rapidly; between 1801 and 1901 the increase was over 100,000. This expansion resulted in the spread southwards of the town.

In 1854, a [[Great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead|catastrophic explosion]] on the quayside destroyed most of Gateshead's medieval heritage, and caused widespread damage on the Newcastle side of the river.

[[Sir Joseph Swan]] lived at [[Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead]] from 1869 to 1883, where his experiments led to the invention of the [[electric light bulb]]. The house was the first in the world to be wired for domestic electric light.

In 1889 one of the largest employers ([[Hawks, Crawshay and Sons]]) closed down and unemployment has since been a burden. Up to the [[Second World War]] there were repeated newspaper reports of the unemployed sending deputations to the council to provide work. The depression years of the 1920s and 1930s created even more joblessness and the [[Team Valley]] Trading Estate was built in the mid-1930s to alleviate the situation.

===Regeneration===
[[File:Gateshead Millennium Bridge at night in January 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Gateshead Quays]] across the [[River Tyne]] at night – [[Gateshead Millennium Bridge]] and behind it [[GH Music Centre|The Glasshouse]]]]
In the late [[noughties]], Gateshead Council started to regenerate the town, with the long-term aim of making Gateshead a city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2008/12/17/first-shots-revealed-of-gateshead-s-future-72703-22497054/ |title=First shots revealed of Gateshead's future |work=The Evening Chronicle |date=17 December 2008 |access-date=17 December 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220224337/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2008/12/17/first-shots-revealed-of-gateshead-s-future-72703-22497054/ |archive-date=20 December 2008 }}</ref> The most extensive transformation occurred in the [[Quayside]], with almost all the structures there being constructed or refurbished in this time.

In the early 2010s, regeneration refocused on the town centre. The £150&nbsp;million [[Trinity Square, Gateshead|Trinity Square]] development opened in May 2013, it incorporates student accommodation, a cinema, health centre and shops.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/gatesheads-150m-trinity-square-officially-4010568 |title=Gateshead's £150m Trinity Square is officially opened |author=Wood, Kerry |date=24 May 2013 |work=nechronicle |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717203010/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/gatesheads-150m-trinity-square-officially-4010568 |archive-date=17 July 2014 }}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Carbuncle Cup]] in September 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/carter-carpark-replacement-trinity-square-7696830 |title=Get Carter carpark replacement Trinity Square up for 'ugliest building' award |author=Metcalfe, Will |date=1 September 2014 |work=nechronicle |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903084533/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/carter-carpark-replacement-trinity-square-7696830 |archive-date=3 September 2014 }}</ref>  The cup was however awarded to another development which involved [[Tesco]], [[Woolwich Central Riverside|Woolwich Central]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.bt.com/news/uknews/inept-tesco-complex-voted-uks-ugliest-building-11363930427660 |title='Inept' Tesco complex voted UK's ugliest building |work=BT.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904182225/http://home.bt.com/news/uknews/inept-tesco-complex-voted-uks-ugliest-building-11363930427660 |archive-date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>

==Governance==

In 1835, Gateshead was established as a [[municipal borough]]<ref name=gBoroughHist1974>{{cite web | url = http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/f55bf2c6-3190-4ba0-b5cd-100c8c6e856f | title = Gateshead County Borough | quote = In 1974, under the 1972 Local Government Act Gateshead County Borough merged with... to form Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council (see MD/GA). | website = nationalarchives.gov.uk | publisher = Tyne and Wear Archives | access-date = 23 November 2016 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133043/http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/f55bf2c6-3190-4ba0-b5cd-100c8c6e856f | archive-date = 23 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> and in 1889 it was made a [[county borough]], independent from [[Durham County Council]].

In 1870, the [[Old Town Hall, Gateshead|Old Town Hall]] was built, designed by John Johnstone who also designed the previously built [[Newcastle Town Hall]].<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Discovering NewcastleGateshead|last1=Donaghy|first1=Peter|last2=Laidler|first2=John|publisher=Sigma Leisure|year=2012|isbn=978-1-85058-913-6|pages=27}}</ref>  The ornamental clock in front of the old town hall was presented to Gateshead in 1892 by the mayor, Walter de Lancey Willson, on the occasion of him being elected for a third time.<ref name=":0" />  He was also one of the founders of Walter Willson's, a chain of grocers in the North East and Cumbria.<ref name=":0" />  The old town hall also served as a magistrate's court and one of Gateshead's police stations.<ref name=":0" />

===Current===
[[File:Gateshead Council building.jpg|thumb|[[Gateshead Civic Centre]] completed in 1987]]
In 1974, following the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the County Borough of Gateshead was merged with the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of [[Felling, Tyne and Wear|Felling]], [[Whickham]], [[Blaydon]] and [[Ryton, Tyne and Wear|Ryton]] and part of the [[rural district]] of [[Chester-le-Street (district)|Chester-le-Street]] to create the much larger [[Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead]].<ref name=gBoroughHist1974/>

==Geography==
The town of Gateshead is in the [[North East England|North East of England]] in the ceremonial county of [[Tyne and Wear]], and within the historic boundaries of [[County Durham]]. It is located on the southern bank of the [[River Tyne]] at a [[latitude]] of 54.57° N and a [[longitude]] of 1.35° W.
Gateshead experiences a [[temperate]] climate which is considerably warmer than some other locations at similar latitudes as a result of the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] (via the [[North Atlantic drift]]). It is located in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[North Pennines]] and is therefore in one of the driest regions of the [[United Kingdom]].

One of the most distinguishing features of Gateshead is its [[topography]]. The land rises 230 feet from [[Gateshead Quays]] to the town centre and continues rising to a height of 525 feet at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in [[Sheriff Hill]]. This is in contrast to the flat and low lying [[Team Valley]] located on the western edges of town. The high elevations allow for impressive views over the Tyne valley into [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and across [[Tyneside]] to [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and the [[North Sea]] from lookouts in Windmill Hills and Windy Nook respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publicartonline.org.uk/resources/reports/documents/AngelSymposiumMap.pdf |title=Layout 1 |access-date=7 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227012428/http://www.publicartonline.org.uk/resources/reports/documents/AngelSymposiumMap.pdf |archive-date=27 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/countryside/sites/windynook.aspx |title=Windy Nook Nature Park Local Nature Reserve |publisher=Gateshead.gov.uk |access-date=22 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606201327/http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/countryside/sites/windynook.aspx |archive-date=6 June 2012 }}</ref>

The [[Office for National Statistics]] defines the town as an urban sub-division. The 2011 ONS urban sub-division of Gateshead contains the historical County Borough together with areas that the town has absorbed, including [[Dunston, Tyne and Wear|Dunston]], [[Felling, Tyne and Wear|Felling]], [[Heworth, Tyne and Wear|Heworth]], [[Pelaw]] and [[Bill Quay]].<ref name="citypopulation.de">These are the boundaries of the town of Gateshead (2011 methodology) {{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-northeastengland.php?cityid=E35001222 |title=North East England (United Kingdom): Counties and Unitary Districts & Settlements - Population Statistics, Charts and Map |access-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223064148/http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-northeastengland.php?cityid=E35001222 |archive-date=23 February 2016 }}</ref>

Given the proximity of Gateshead to Newcastle, just south of the [[River Tyne]] from the [[Newcastle upon Tyne City Centre|city centre]], it is sometimes incorrectly referred to as being a part of Newcastle. [[Gateshead Council]] and [[Newcastle City Council]] teamed up in 2000 to create a unified marketing brand name, [[NewcastleGateshead]], to better promote the whole of the Tyneside conurbation.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has small differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round to meet the criterion for Oceanic climate, at least 30&nbsp;mm per month. The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[Köppen climate classification#Group C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]" (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=591108&cityname=Gateshead%2C+England%2C+United+Kingdom&units=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130712075342/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=591108&cityname=Gateshead,+England,+United+Kingdom&units=|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 July 2013|title=Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|work=Weatherbase}}</ref>

It is a part of the local [[development plan]] which is in conjunction with Newcastle city borough, and was created in the 1960s.

Its stated aims<ref>{{cite web|title=Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan - Section 3 Strategic Policies - Chapter 12 People and Place|url=https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/default/files/wwwfileroot/planning-and-buildings/planning-policy/section_3_-_strategic_policies.pdf|website=www.newcastle.gov.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122134206/https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/default/files/wwwfileroot/planning-and-buildings/planning-policy/section_3_-_strategic_policies.pdf|archive-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> are to:

* ''Prevent the merging of settlements, particularly: Gateshead with [[Hebburn]], [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], Birtley or Whickham ...the main built-up area with nearby villages; and villages with each other,'' 
* ''Safeguard the countryside from encroachment,''
* ''Check unrestricted [[urban sprawl]], and''
* ''Assist in urban regeneration in the city-region by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.''

In the Gateshead borough boundary, as well as the aforementioned areas, it also surrounds the communities of [[Chopwell]], [[Crawcrook]], [[Greenside, Tyne and Wear|Greenside]], [[High Spen]], [[Kibblesworth]], Lockhaugh, [[Rowlands Gill]], [[Ryton, Tyne and Wear|Ryton]], [[Sunniside, Gateshead|Sunniside]], as well several small hamlets. Landscape features and facilities such as woods and nature reserves, local golf courses, Burdon Moor and Whinell Hill are also within the green belt area.

===Districts===
The town of Gateshead consists of the following districts. Some of them were once separate settlements that were absorbed by encroaching [[urban sprawl]], while others consist entirely of retail, industrial and housing estates. Many of these areas overlap each other and their boundaries are by no means official or fixed. Gateshead is a Town (Urban Subdivision) in the [[Tyneside urban area]].<ref name="citypopulation.de"/>

==Demography==
{{Update|part=section|date=September 2024|reason=Updated data from [[2021 United Kingdom census|Census 2021]] is now available}}
The table below compares the demographics of Gateshead with the wider Metropolitan borough. The town's population in 2011 was 120,046 compared with 78,403 in 2001. This is due to a slight population increase and boundary and methodology changes since 2001. Felling used to be a separate urban subdivision and had a population of around 35,000, but now it is considered part of Gateshead town. The population of the 2011 census boundaries in 2001 was 113,220,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-northeastengland.php?cityid=E35001222|title=Gateshead (Tyne and Wear, North East England, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics and Location in Maps and Charts|website=www.citypopulation.de|access-date=25 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223064148/http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-northeastengland.php?cityid=E35001222|archive-date=23 February 2016}}</ref> proving that there was some sort of population increase.

==Economy==
Gateshead is home to the [[MetroCentre (shopping centre)|MetroCentre]], the largest [[shopping mall]] in the UK until 2008; and the [[Team Valley]] Trading Estate, once the largest and still one of the larger purpose-built commercial estates in the UK.

===Arts===
The [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]] has been established in a converted flour mill. [[The Glasshouse International Centre for Music]], previously The Sage, a [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]-designed venue for music and the performing arts opened on 17 December 2004. Gateshead also hosted the [[Gateshead Garden Festival]] in 1990, rejuvenating {{convert|200|acre|km2}} of derelict land (now mostly replaced with housing). The [[Angel of the North]], a famous sculpture in nearby [[Lamesley]], is visible from the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] to the south of Gateshead, as well as from the [[East Coast Main Line]]. Other public art include works by [[Richard Deacon (sculptor)|Richard Deacon]], Colin Rose, [[Sally Matthews (sculptor)|Sally Matthews]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], Gordon Young and [[Michael Winstone]].

===Traditional and former===
The earliest recorded coal mining in the Gateshead area is dated to 1344.<ref>{{cite book

In 1576 a small group of Newcastle merchants acquired the 'Grand Lease' of the manors of Gateshead and [[Whickham]]. In the hundred years from 1574 coal shipments from Newcastle increased elevenfold while the population of Gateshead doubled to approximately 5,500. However, the lease and the abundant coal supplies ended in 1680. The pits were shallow as problems of ventilation and flooding defeated attempts to mine coal from the deeper seams.

[[William Cotesworth of Gateshead|William Cotesworth]] (1668-1726) was a prominent merchant based in Gateshead, where he was a leader in coal and international trade. Cotesworth began as the son of a yeoman and apprentice to a tallow - candler. He ended as an esquire, having been mayor, [[Justice of the peace|Justice of the Peace]] and sheriff of Northumberland.  He collected tallow from all over England and sold it across the globe. He imported dyes from the Indies, as well as flax, wine, and grain. He sold tea, sugar, chocolate, and tobacco. He operated the largest coal mines in the area, and was a leading salt producer. As the government's principal agent in the North country, he was in contact with leading ministers.<ref>E. N.

[[Hawks family|William Hawks]], originally a [[blacksmith]], started business in Gateshead in 1747, working with the iron brought to the Tyne as ballast by the Tyne colliers. [[Hawks family|Hawks and Co.]] eventually became one of the biggest iron businesses in the [[Northern England|North]], producing anchors, chains and so on to meet a growing demand. There was keen contemporary rivalry between 'Hawks' Blacks' and 'Crowley's Crew'. The famous 'Hawks' men' including Ned White, went on to be celebrated in [[Geordie]] song and story.

In 1831 a locomotive works was established by the Newcastle and Darlington Railway, later part of the [[York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway]]. In 1854 the works moved to the Greenesfield site and became the manufacturing headquarters of [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]. In 1909, locomotive construction was moved to [[Darlington railway works|Darlington]] and the rest of the works were closed in 1932.

[[Robert Stirling Newall]] took out a patent on the manufacture of wire ropes in 1840 and in partnership with Messrs. Liddell and Gordon, set up his headquarters at Gateshead. A worldwide industry of wire-drawing resulted. The submarine telegraph cable received its definitive form through Newall's initiative, involving the use of [[gutta-percha]] surrounded by strong wires. The first successful [[Dover]]–[[Calais]] cable on 25 September 1851, was made in Newall's works. In 1853, he invented the brake-drum and cone for laying cable in deep seas. Half of the first [[Atlantic]] cable was manufactured in Gateshead. Newall was interested in astronomy, and his giant {{convert|25|in|mm|adj=on}} telescope was set up in the garden at Ferndene, his Gateshead residence, in 1871.

[[J. B. Priestley]], writing of Gateshead in his 1934 travelogue ''[[English Journey]]'', said that "no true civilisation could have produced such a town", adding that it appeared to have been designed "by an enemy of the human race".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Priestley |first1=J B |title=English Journey |date=1934 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-00-4274-1 |page=284 |edition=1977}}</ref>

===Victorian===
[[File:Saltwell Towers.jpg|250px|thumb|Saltwell Towers]]
[[William Wailes]] the celebrated stained-glass maker, lived at South Dene from 1853 to 1860. In 1860, he designed [[Saltwell Park|Saltwell Towers]] as a fairy-tale palace for himself. It is an imposing Victorian mansion in its own park with a romantic skyline of turrets and battlements. It was originally furnished sumptuously by Gerrard Robinson. Some of the panelling installed by Robinson was later moved to the [[Shipley Art Gallery]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1248550|desc=Saltwell Towers|accessdate=21 September 2021}}</ref> Wailes sold Saltwell Towers to the corporation in 1876 for use as a public park, provided he could use the house for the rest of his life. For many years the structure was essentially an empty shell but following a restoration programme it was reopened to the public in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3892855.stm |title=Fairytale mansion gets new life |date=14 July 2004 |work=BBC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610222849/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3892855.stm |archive-date=10 June 2009 }}</ref>

===Former brutalism===
[[File:Trinitycarpark.jpg|400px|thumb|[[Trinity Centre Multi-Storey Car Park|Trinity Centre Car Park]] in Gateshead town centre, as seen in the film ''[[Get Carter]]'' (since demolished)]]
The [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] [[Trinity Square, Gateshead|Trinity Centre Car Park]], which was designed by [[Owen Luder]], dominated the town centre for many years until its demolition in 2010. A product of attempts to regenerate the area in the 1960s, the car park gained an iconic status due to its appearance in the 1971 film ''[[Get Carter]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]]. An unsuccessful campaign to have the structure [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed]] was backed by [[Sylvester Stallone]], who played the main role in the [[Get Carter (2000 film)|2000 remake]] of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/freedom_of_information/106152docs.pdf |title=FOI 106152 released information |access-date=7 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304104753/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/freedom_of_information/106152docs.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Collett |first=Christopher |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/132154-good-riddance-to-the-gateshead-multi-storey-car-park |title=Good Riddance to the Gateshead Multi-Storey Car Park |work=Metro.co.uk |date=10 April 2008 |access-date=22 May 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930130602/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/132154-good-riddance-to-the-gateshead-multi-storey-car-park |archive-date=30 September 2012 }}</ref> The car park was scheduled for demolition in 2009, but this was delayed as a result of a disagreement between [[Tesco]], who re-developed the site, and [[Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead|Gateshead Council]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7812682.stm | work=BBC News | title=Historic car park finally closes | date=5 January 2009 | access-date=2 April 2010}}</ref> The council had not been given firm assurances that Tesco would build the previously envisioned town centre development which was to include a Tesco mega-store as well as shops, restaurants, cafes, bars, offices and student accommodation.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |author=Pearson, Adrian |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/12/14/council-blocks-get-carter-car-park-demolition-72703-25386958/ |title=Council blocks Get Carter car park demolition |work=ChronicleLive |date=14 December 2009 |access-date=22 May 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501042404/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/12/14/council-blocks-get-carter-car-park-demolition-72703-25386958/ |archive-date=1 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.yourtrinitysquare.co.uk/trinity-square-development.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609011624/http://www.yourtrinitysquare.co.uk/trinity-square-development.asp|date=9 June 2008}}</ref> The council effectively used the car park as a bargaining tool to ensure that the company adhered to the original proposals and blocked its demolition until they submitted a suitable planning application.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Demolition finally took place in July–August 2010.

The [[Derwent Tower]], another well known example of brutalist architecture, was also designed by Owen Luder and stood in the neighbourhood of [[Dunston, Tyne and Wear|Dunston]]. Like the Trinity Car Park it also failed in its bid to become a [[listed building]] and was demolished in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/10/30/dunston-rocket-will-not-be-listed-by-english-heritage-72703-25051807/ |title=Dunston Rocket will not be listed by English Heritage |work=ChronicleLive |date=30 October 2009 |access-date=22 May 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527134321/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/10/30/dunston-rocket-will-not-be-listed-by-english-heritage-72703-25051807/ |archive-date=27 May 2010 }}</ref> Also located in this area are the Grade II listed [[Dunston Staiths]] which were built in 1890.

==Sport==
[[File:Gateshead stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Gateshead International Stadium]]]]
[[Gateshead International Stadium]] regularly holds international [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] meetings over the summer months, and is home of the [[Gateshead Harriers]] athletics club. It is also host to [[rugby league]] fixtures, and the home ground of [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead Football Club]]. [[Newcastle Thunder|Gateshead Thunder]] Rugby League Football Club played at Gateshead International Stadium until its purchase by Newcastle Rugby Limited and the subsequent rebranding as [[Newcastle Thunder]]. Both clubs have had their problems: [[Gateshead A.F.C.]] were controversially voted out of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1960 in favour of [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], whilst [[Gateshead Thunder (1999)|Gateshead Thunder]] lost their place in [[Super League]] as a result of a takeover (officially termed a merger) by [[Hull F.C.]] Both Gateshead clubs continue to ply their trade at lower levels in their respective sports, thanks mainly to the efforts of their supporters. The [[Gateshead Senators]] [[American Football]] team also use the International Stadium, as well as this it was used in the 2006 Northern Conference champions in the [[British American Football League]].

Gateshead Leisure Centre is home to the Gateshead Phoenix Basketball Team. The team currently plays in EBL League Division 4. Home games are usually on a Sunday afternoon during the season, which runs from September to March. The team was formed in 2013 and ended their initial season well placed to progress after defeating local rivals Newcastle Eagles II and promotion chasing [[Kingston Panthers]].

In [[Low Fell]] there is a cricket club and a rugby club adjacent to each other on Eastwood Gardens. These are Gateshead Fell Cricket Club<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.the-fell.co.uk/ |title = Gateshead Fell Cricket Club |work = the-fell.co.uk |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140816134301/http://www.the-fell.co.uk/ |archive-date = 16 August 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> and Gateshead Rugby Club.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/gatesheadrugbyfootballclub/|title =Gateshead RC|url-status =live|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141219040720/http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/gatesheadrugbyfootballclub|archive-date =19 December 2014|df =dmy-all}}</ref>  Gateshead Rugby Club was formed in 1998 following the merger of Gateshead Fell Rugby Club and North Durham Rugby Club.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/gatesheadrugbyfootballclub/a/history-8317.html|title =Gateshead Rugby Club|url-status =live|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150109124217/http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/gatesheadrugbyfootballclub/a/history-8317.html|archive-date =9 January 2015|df =dmy-all}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Rail===
Gateshead is served by the following rail transport stations with some being operated by [[National Rail]] and some being [[Tyne & Wear Metro]] stations: {{rws|Dunston}}, {{stl|Tyne and Wear Metro|Felling}}, [[Gateshead Interchange]], {{stl|Tyne and Wear Metro|Gateshead Stadium}}, [[Heworth Interchange]], {{rws|MetroCentre}} and {{stl|Tyne and Wear Metro|Pelaw}}.

[[Tyne & Wear Metro]] stations at Gateshead Interchange and Gateshead Stadium provide direct light-rail access to {{rws|Newcastle Central}}, [[Newcastle Airport metro station|Newcastle Airport]], {{rws|Sunderland}}, {{rws|Tynemouth}} and [[South Shields Interchange]].

[[National Rail]] services are provided by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] at [[Dunston railway station|Dunston]] and [[MetroCentre railway station|MetroCentre]] stations. The [[East Coast Main Line]], which runs from {{rws|London Kings Cross}} to {{rws|Edinburgh Waverley}}, cuts directly through the town on its way between {{rws|Newcastle Central}} and {{rws|Chester-le-Street}} stations. There are presently no stations on this line within Gateshead, as {{rws|Low Fell}}, {{rws|Bensham}} and {{rws|Gateshead West}} stations were closed in 1952, 1954 and 1965 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://isee.gateshead.gov.uk/detail.php?type=related&kv=3246&t=objects |title=2 Related Thesaurus Terms |publisher=Isee.gateshead.gov.uk |access-date=22 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303222838/http://isee.gateshead.gov.uk/detail.php?type=related&kv=3246&t=objects |archive-date=3 March 2012}}</ref>

==Religion==

===Christianity===
Christianity has been present in the town since at least the 7th century, when [[Bede]] mentioned a monastery in Gateshead. A church in the town was burned down in 1080 with the [[Bishop of Durham]] inside.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} St Mary's Church was built near to the site of that building, and was the only church in the town until the 1820s. Undoubtedly the oldest building on the Quayside, St Mary's has now re-opened to the public as the town's first heritage centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to-do/st-marys-heritage-centre-p331141|title=St. Mary's Heritage Centre - Heritage / Visitor Centre in Gateshead, Gateshead - NewcastleGateshead|website=www.newcastlegateshead.com|access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref>
