==History==
The Vietnamese began to settle in the then Khmer territory in 1770.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} The [[Cao Đài]] religion originated in Tây Ninh. It is the birthplace of [[Trình Minh Thế]], a nationalist and military leader during the end of the [[First Indochina War]].

Because of the once-vaunted political and military power of the Cao Dai, this region was the scene of prolonged and heavy fighting during the [[First Indochina War]]. Tây Ninh province served as a major terminus of the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and in 1969 the Viet Cong captured Tây Ninh town and held it for several days. During the period of conflict between [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]] in the late 1970s, the [[Khmer Rouge]] launched a number of cross-border raids into Tây Ninh province and committed atrocities against civilians. Several cemeteries around Tây Ninh are stark reminders of these events.<ref name="Planet 2010">{{cite web | last=Planet | first=Lonely | title=History in Tay Ninh, Vietnam | website=Lonely Planet | date=January 1, 2010 | url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/tay-ninh/background/history/a/nar/7d2393e3-6f05-438c-96c0-08932873f78c/357857 | access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref>

The province has about 1,300ha of fruits, including soursop, grapefruit, pineapple, banana and dragon fruit, which are grown under VietGAP standards.<ref name="vietnamnews.vn 2016">{{cite web | title=Tây Ninh upgrades irrigation networks to improve agricultural production | website=vietnamnews.vn | date=November 26, 2016 | url=http://vietnamnews.vn/society/506274/tay-ninh-upgrades-irrigation-networks-to-improve-agricultural-production.html | access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref>
