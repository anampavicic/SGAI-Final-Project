Within months of Victoria [[History of Victoria#Separation from New South Wales|separating]] from the colony of [[New South Wales]] in 1851, gold was discovered near Ballarat, sparking the [[Victorian gold rush]]. Ballarat subsequently became a thriving [[boomtown]] that for a time rivalled [[Melbourne]], the capital of Victoria, in terms of wealth and cultural influence. In 1854, following a period of civil disobedience in Ballarat over gold licenses, local miners launched an armed uprising against government forces. Known as the [[Eureka Rebellion]], it led to the introduction of white male [[suffrage in Australia]], and as such is interpreted as the origin of [[democracy in Australia|Australian democracy]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol.

Proclaimed a city on 9 September 1870,<ref>{{Cite news |date=9 September 1870 |title=Proclamation |pages=1328 |work=Victoria Government Gazette |url=http://gazette.slv.vic.gov.au/view.cgi?year=1870&class=general&page_num=1328&state=V&classNum=G61&searchCode=6818232 |access-date=28 May 2023}}</ref> Ballarat's prosperity, unlike that of many other gold boomtowns, continued until the late 19th century, as the city's fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades. By the turn of the century, Ballarat's importance relative to Melbourne rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre and is the commercial capital and largest city of the Central Highlands, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and well-preserved colonial-era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays.

Yields were particularly high, with the first prospectors in the area extracting between half an ounce<ref>Ballarat Diggings: From the Correspondent of the Geelong Advertiser. pg 2. The Argus. 13 September 1851.</ref> (which was more than the average wage of the time) and up to five ounces of alluvial gold per day. As news of the [[Victorian gold rush]] reached the world, Ballarat gained an international reputation as a particularly rich goldfield. As a result, a huge influx of immigrants occurred, including many from Ireland and China, gathering in a collection of prospecting [[shanty town]]s around the creeks and hills. Within a few months, numerous alluvial runs were established, several deep mining leads began, and the population had swelled to over 1,000 people.<ref name="Ballarat Population 1852">{{cite news |title = Victoria – Mount Alexander |date = 11 December 1852 |work =The Sydney Morning Herald|page = 2 |access-date =6 May 2012 |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12942220}}</ref>

Civil disobedience in Ballarat led to an armed civil uprising, the [[Eureka Rebellion]] (colloquially referred to as the "Eureka Stockade") which took place in Ballarat on 3 December 1854. The event, in which 22 miners were killed, is considered to be a defining moment in Australian history.

The city earned the nickname "The Golden City" in the 1850s.<ref>Perkin, Corrie [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/golden-city-of-ballarat-comes-into-the-picture/story-e6frg8n6-1225768084821 Golden city of Ballarat comes into the picture] The Australian 1 September 2009.</ref> The gold rush population peaked at almost 60,000, mostly male diggers, by 1858.<ref>{{cite news |title = Gold Rush Population Peak 1858-9-23 |date = 23 September 1858 |work = The Star |page = 2 |access-date =6 May 2012 |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page6460448?zoomLevel=1}}</ref> However the early population was largely itinerant.

Confidence of the city's early citizens in the enduring future of their city is evident in the sheer scale of many of the early public buildings, generous public recreational spaces, and opulence of many of its commercial establishments and private housing.

From the late 1860s to the early 20th century, Ballarat made a successful transition from a gold rush town to an industrial-age city. The ramshackle tents and timber buildings gradually made way for permanent buildings, many impressive structures of solid stone and brick mainly built from wealth generated by early mining.

[[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited between 9 and 13 December 1867 and as the first royal visit, the occasion was met with great fanfare.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly">{{cite book |last1 = Clarke |first1 = Jan |title = Speak Out Boldly: The first 125 years of the Ballarat Courier |publisher = The Courier |year = 1992 |location = Ballarat |page = 12 |isbn =978-0-646-09971-2}}</ref> The Prince Room was prepared at Craigs Royal Hotel for his stay.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.craigsroyal.com.au/accommodation/Video/history/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120525042154/http://www.craigsroyal.com.au/accommodation/Video/history/ |archive-date = 25 May 2012 |title = Craig's Royal Hotel – History |access-date =30 June 2012 |publisher = craigsroyal.com.au}}</ref> The city's first civic centre—Prince Alfred Hall—erected over the Yarrowee between the two municipalities, was named in his honour during his visit.

Ballarat was proclaimed a city in 1871. Gong Gong dam was built in 1877 to alleviate flooding and to provide a permanent water supply. A [[Serviceton railway line|direct railway to Melbourne]] was completed in December 1889.<ref name="newsrail-line">{{cite journal

An extensive [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|access-date=19 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|archive-date=9 July 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. While planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 and 1962.

The 1950s brought a new optimism to the city. On 17 April 1952 it was announced that Lake Wendouree was to be the venue for rowing events of the 1956 Summer Olympics,<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/> and work soon began on an Olympic village in Gillies Street. A new prefabricted power terminal substation at Norman Street Ballarat North was constructed between 1951 and 1953 by the State Electricity Commission.<ref>Ballarat 'B' Power Station. Ballarat Historical Society – private collection</ref> The first [[Begonia Festival]], a highly successful community celebration, was held in 1953. [[Elizabeth II]] visited on 8 March 1954.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/> The Civic Centre, Prince Alfred Hall had burned down suspiciously that year; however a new Civic Hall was constructed and opened in March 1955. On 23 November 1956, the Olympic torch was carried through the city, and the following day the rowing events were held at the lake.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/> On 2 March 1958 the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] visited Ballarat.

During the following decades, the city saw increased threats to its heritage. In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.

During the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. [[Charles III of the United Kingdom|Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.<ref>City of Ballarat Mayors Report 1974 – 1975</ref>

Ballarat played an important role in the [[Stolen Generations|Stolen Generation]] throughout the 20th century, where the [[Ballarat Orphanage]] saw Aboriginal children who had been taken from their families. The Ballarat and District Aboriginal Co-operative (BADAC) was established by members of the Ballarat and district Aboriginal community in 1979. It became a co-operative to deliver health, social, welfare and community development programs to local Aboriginal people. In 2017, local Aboriginal community elder Ted Lovett was awarded the [[Order of Australia Medal]] for services to the indigenous community and for his works in eliminating racism in sports in south-west Victoria. Karen Heap and Ted Lovett were listed on the Victoria's Aboriginal Honour Role both in part for their work at BADAC.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Whelan|first=Melanie|date=2019-11-12|title=Ted Lovett, Karen Heap hope for 'path finders' in fight for equality|url=https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6487496/ted-lovett-karen-heap-hope-for-path-finders-in-fight-for-equality/|access-date=2021-11-15|website=The Courier|language=en-AU}}</ref>

The city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan|access-date=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723152436/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |access-date=18 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |archive-date=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Mount Warrenheip Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|Ballarat's skyline is hidden from this view of the city looking east across Lake Wendouree to Mount Warrenheip.]]
[[File:Warrenheip from Dawson St.png|thumb|Mount Warrenheip dominating the skyline from Dawson Street, with the town hall clock tower on the right.]]
Ballarat lies at the foothills of the [[Great Dividing Range]] in Central Western Victoria. Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its elevated position and moderate hills and terrain with a lack of any alpine mountains that are situated a few hundred kilometres NE. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland volcanic plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.

Geologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong (750m, 2460&nbsp;ft) and Warrenheip (746m, 2446&nbsp;ft), which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location – http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.

There are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex. Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.

The contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately {{convert|90|km2|0|abbr=on}} of the local government area's {{convert|740|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Land Use">{{cite web |url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |title = Ballarat Planning Scheme – Land Use |access-date = 14 May 2012 |date = 18 March 2010 |work = City of Ballarat |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420101928/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |archive-date = 20 April 2012 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban.<ref name="Land Use"/> From the city centre this area extends approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} north to the hills around Invermay, approximately {{convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=on}} east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west along the plains to Lucas and approximately {{convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=on}} south along the Yarrowee River and Canadian Creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong.<ref name="HIS 2011-10"/> The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee River and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs. The reach of the Yarrowee River toward Ballarat Central becomes a stormwater drain and is completely covered over as it flows under the CBD.

Ballarat is a primarily low-rise city. The City of Ballarat defines two [[activity centre|Major Activity Centre]]s within the urban area – the Central Business District (CBD) and Wendouree with a high concentration of business, retail and community function based primarily on the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning model and a further 11 neighbourhood activity centres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/991206/ballarat_c151_panel_report.pdf|title=Ballarat Panel Report|access-date=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317222144/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/991206/ballarat_c151_panel_report.pdf|archive-date=17 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The tallest building in urban Ballarat is the seven-storey Henry Bolte wing of the Ballarat Base Hospital (1994). Beyond the central area, urban Ballarat extends into several suburban areas with a mixture of housing styles. Predominant styles are 19th-century villas, Victorian terraces,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianterrace.com/terraced-houses-in/victoria/ballarat/|title=Ballarat|work=Australian Terrace Houses|access-date=22 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529172500/http://www.australianterrace.com/terraced-houses-in/victoria/ballarat/|archive-date=29 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Federation homes and [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] red brick homes. Settlement patterns around Ballarat consist of small villages and country towns, some with less than a few thousand people.

The central business district (located in [[Ballarat Central]]) is a large mixed-use office and retail district bounded to the north by railway lines, to the west by Drummond Street, to the south to Grant Street and to the east by Princes Street and spanning the floodplain of the Yarrowee River. Lydiard, Sturt Streets, Armstrong, Doveton, Dana Street and Bridge Street (known as Bridge Mall) along with the historic centre of East Ballarat—Main Street and Bakery Hill have retained stands of commercial and civic buildings of state and national heritage significance.

The inner established suburbs were initially laid out around the key mining areas and include [[Ballarat East, Victoria|Ballarat East]], [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]], [[Golden Point, Victoria|Golden Point]], [[Soldiers Hill, Victoria|Soldiers Hill]], [[Black Hill, Ballarat|Black Hill]], [[Brown Hill, Victoria|Brown Hill]], [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka]], [[Canadian, Victoria|Canadian]], [[Mount Pleasant, Victoria|Mount Pleasant]], [[Redan, Victoria|Redan]], [[Sebastopol, Victoria|Sebastopol]] and [[Newington, Victoria|Newington]].

The legacy of the wealth generated during Ballarat's gold boom is still visible in a large number of fine stone buildings in and around the city, especially in the Lydiard Street area. This precinct contains some of Victoria's finest examples of [[Victorian era]] buildings, many of which are on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]] or classified by the [[National Trust of Australia]]. Notable civic buildings include the Town Hall (1870–72), the former Post Office (1864), the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery (1887), the [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]] (1860, 1869), the Queen Victoria Wards of the Ballarat Base Hospital (1890s) and the [[Ballarat railway station]] (1862, 1877, 1888).

The [[Ballarat Botanical Gardens]] (established in 1858) are recognised as the finest example of a regional botanical gardens in Australia and are home to many heritage listed exotic tree species and feature a modern glasshouse and horticultural centre and the [[Prime Ministers Avenue]] which features bronze busts of every past Australian Prime Minister.

Ballarat is notable for its very wide boulevards. The main street is Sturt Street with over {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} of central gardens known as the [[Sturt Street Gardens]] featuring bandstands, fountains, statues, monuments, memorials and lampposts. Ballarat is home to the largest of a collection of [[Avenue of honour|Avenues of Honour]] in Victoria. The {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} Ballarat Avenue of Honour consists of a total of approximately 4,000 trees, mostly [[deciduous]] which in many parts arch completely over the road. Each tree has a bronze plaque dedicated to a soldier from the Ballarat region who enlisted during World War I. The Avenue of Honour and the Arch of Victory are on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]] and are seen by approximately 20,000 visitors each year.

The city also has the greatest concentration of public statuary in any Australian city with many parks and streets featuring sculptures and statues dating from the 1860s to the present. Some of the other notable memorials located in the [[Sturt Street Gardens]] in the middle of Ballarat's main boulevard include a bandstand situated in the heart of the city that was funded and built by the City of Ballarat Band in 1913 as a tribute to the bandsmen of the {{RMS|Titanic}}, a fountain dedicated to the early explorers [[Burke and Wills]], and those dedicated to monarchs and those who have played pivotal roles in the development of the city and its rich social fabric. These include, [[Robert Burns]], [[Peter Lalor]], [[Sir Albert Coates]], [[Harold Edward Elliott]] (Pompey Elliot), [[William Dunstan]], [[King George V]], [[Queen Victoria]] and more.

Ballarat has an extensive array of significant war memorials, the most recent of which is the Australian [[Ex Prisoner of War Memorial]]. The most prominent memorial in the city is the Ballarat [[Triumphal Arch|Victory Arch]] that spans the old Western Highway on the Western approaches of the city. The archway serves as the focal point for the Avenue of Honour. Other significant individual monuments located along Sturt Street include those dedicated to the Boer War (1899–1901), the World War II (1939–1945) cenotaph, and Vietnam (1962–1972) (located adjacent to the Arch of Victory).

Temperatures can dip below freezing from May to September, however, a low of 0-2&nbsp;°C is more common - widespread frosts and fog are a regular sight. Snowfall typically falls on nearby [[Mount Buninyong]] and [[Mount Warrenheip]] several times a year, but in the urban area only once or twice, particularly during heavy winters. Snow has been known to fall heavily with several centimetres accumulating even in the CBD. Heavy snow seasons occurred in 1900–1902 and 1905–1907 (with record falls in 1906), and moderate snow seasons were recorded during the 1940s and 1980s.

==Environment==
===Natural reserves and commons===
[[File:BallaratTownCommon.jpg|thumb|Ballarat Town Common in autumn 2018]]
While there are no national parks in Ballarat's proximity, Ballarat is bordered by extensive bushland to the north, south and south west and sensitive [[wetlands]] to the east. The most central park to the city is the 130 ha Victoria Park, with a plethora of ovals and fields, playgrounds, walking tracks and quiet roads. There are a number of nearby state parks and large reserves including the [[Enfield State Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creswick.net/things_to_do/bush_walking|title=Creswick, Bush Walking, Scenery, History, Landcare|first=UBC Web|last=Design|work=creswick.net}}</ref> Creswick Regional Park, [[Mount Warrenheip]] Flora Reserve, [[Mount Buninyong]] Reserve and [[Lake Burrumbeet]] park. There are also smaller parks, like Black Hill, Victoria Park, Pioneer Park and Yarowee Reserve, located within walking distance of the city centre.

Ballarat is unique in Australia—and internationally—for having retained much of its [[commons]] land, which can be used by any resident of Ballarat. Ballarat Town Common, Ballarat West Town Common and Ballarat Common are located to the west of the city. Ballarat Town Common can be accessed via Howe Street in Miners Rest and is used by dog walkers and ramblers, especially because of its open grass fields and native wetland. Ballarat West Town Common is presently farmed on by licensed farmers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmaknowledgebase.vic.gov.au/soilhealth/soils_resource_details.php?resource_id=4093|title=Ballarat West Town Common : Landscape plan and future management|first=Wicks, A.

==Economy==
The economy of Ballarat is driven by all three [[economic sector]]s, though contemporary Ballarat has emerged as a primarily [[service economy]] with its main [[industry (economics)|industry]] being the [[service industry]] and its key areas of business including [[tourism]], [[hospitality]], [[retail]], [[professional services]], government administration and [[education]]. [[Secondary sector]] including [[manufacturing]], which had grown in the 20th century remains an important sector. The city's historic [[primary sector]] roots including [[mining]] and [[agriculture]] continue to play a role, though one that has declined since the 20th century. Industries emerging this century include [[information technology]] service sector and [[renewable energy]].

===Service industries===
As a major service centre for the populous goldfields region, Ballarat has large sectors of employment in business including retail, professional services and [[tradespeople|trades]] as well as state and federal government branch offices for [[public services]] and [[health care]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-government]] [[service organisation]]s. Collectively these industries employ more than half of the city's workforce and generate the bulk of the city's economic activity.

Ballarat is the main retail economy in the region. The city has several key retail districts including a [[pedestrian mall]] known as Bridge Mall comprising over 100 traders. There are also indoor shopping malls including Central Square Shopping Centre and [[Stockland Wendouree]]. better known as Wendouree Village, with a large number of [[specialty store]]s. Major department stores include [[Myer]], [[Target Australia|Target]], [[Big W]], [[Kmart Australia|Kmart]], [[Harvey Norman]] and [[Harris Scarfe]].<ref>Harris Scarfe Ballarat store opens.

A significant [[heritage tourism]] industry has not grown substantially in Ballarat since the 1960s. Ballarat is most notable for the award-winning [[open-air museum]] known as [[Sovereign Hill]], a recreated 1850s gold mining settlement opened in 1970. Sovereign Hill is Ballarat's biggest tourism drawcard and is consistently rated among the best outdoor museums in the world and continues to expand. Sovereign Hill accounts for over half a million of Ballarat's visitors and $40&nbsp;million in tourism revenue.<ref>[http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=sovereignhil Business Ballarat – Sovereign Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325193018/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=sovereignhil |date=25 March 2012 }}</ref>

Several businesses and attractions have capitalised on Ballarat's gold mining history.

The recently accelerated growth rate has been attributed by demographers to increased commuter activity arising from surging house and land prices in Melbourne coupled with public transport improvements between Ballarat and Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The motor vehicle is the main form of transport in Ballarat. A network of state highways radiate from Ballarat and the [[Western Freeway (Victoria)|Western Freeway]] (A8) [[dual carriageway]] bypasses the central city to the north of the urban area, providing a direct road connection to Melbourne (approximately 90&nbsp;minutes), westward to [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] (approximately 75&nbsp;minutes) and [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]]. Five freeway interchanges service the urban area, East Ballarat (half diamond) interchange at Victoria Street (C805); Brown Hill interchange (full diamond) at Daylesford-Ballarat Road (C292), Creswick Road interchange (full diamond) at Wendouree (A300); the Mount Rowan interchange (half diamond) at Gillies Road, Wendouree (C307) and the Mitchell Park interchange (full diamond) at Howe Street (C287). The [[Midland Highway (Victoria)|Midland Highway]] is a dual carriageway which runs north along Creswick Road to the Western Freeway interchange but becomes a single carriageway north of Ballarat to [[Creswick]] (approximately 25&nbsp;minutes) and runs south as the dual carriageway of Skipton Road to Magpie before becoming a single carriageway to [[Geelong]] (approximately 87&nbsp;minutes). The [[Glenelg Highway]] connects directly to [[Mount Gambier]] and the [[Sunraysia Highway]] west of Ballarat which connects directly to [[Mildura]].
