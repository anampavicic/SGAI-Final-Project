'''Maradi''' is the second largest city in [[Niger]] and the administrative centre of [[Maradi Region]]. It is also the seat of the [[Maradi Department]] and an Urban Commune.

==History==
Originally part of [[Katsina]], a [[Hausa people|Hausa]] state, it became independent in the 19th century.<ref>Abdourahmane Idrissa, Samuel Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Niger'', Scarecrow Press, USA, 2012, p. 316</ref> From the early 19th century, Maradi was home to one of several Hausa traditional rump states, formed by rulers and nobility who fled the rise of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].<ref name="Bradt">Geels, Jolijn, (2006) ''Bradt Travel Guide – Niger'', pgs. 203–212</ref> Elements of the Katsina ruling class continued to claim the area as the seat of a Katsina state in exile ruled by the ''Sarkin Katsina Maradi''. Maradi was constrained by the more powerful [[Gobir]] exilic state to the west, the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] based at [[Zinder]] to the east, and Sokoto to the south. The arrival of the French in 1899 saw the bloody destruction of the town by the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]], but later the town recovered to become an important regional centre of commerce by the 1950s.

The expansion of the city in the first half of the 20th century was dynamic, albeit modest, with the population nearly doubling between 1911 and 1950.<ref name=source1>[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/pt5/travaux_d/23390.pdf ''Les alhazai de Maradi – l’histoire d’une groupe de riche marchands saheliens'']. Emmanuel Gregoire. Éditions de I'ORSTOM. 1990.</ref> Up until 1945, the ancient city of Maradi was located in the valley bordering the [[Goulbi N'Maradi]], a seasonal waterway with its source in Nigeria. The urban area, roughly circular in shape, was protected by a mud wall with four doors; the ancient city was flooded by this river at the end of the rainy season of 1945. To avoid future inundation, the French colonial administration decided then to adjust the urban layout. In the process, the city lost its traditional, irregular layout in favour of a [[grid plan|grid system]].<ref name=source1/> The French sought to create cash-crop agriculture, mostly [[Peanut|groundnuts]], which increasingly made the city an important regional commercial centre. Aided by economic growth after the 1950s, Maradi experienced a demographic boom, with the population increasing from 8,661 in 1950 to 80,000 by 1983.<ref name=source1/> By the time of Niger's independence in 1960, Maradi was a centre of Hausa culture, vying with the larger traditional Hausa centre of Zinder to the east.

In 2000 a riot broke out in the town by Muslim groups opposed to the staging of the Festival International de la Mode en Afrique (FIMA) in Niamey, resulting in the destruction of various buildings deemed un-Islamic, such as brothels and bars.<ref name="Bradt"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2000/11/culture-niger-government-to-ban-islamic-groups-opposed-to-fashion-festival/|title=NCULTURE-NIGER: Government to Ban Islamic Groups Opposed to Fashion Festival|author1=Saidou Arji |author2=Noel Tadegnon |date=15 November 2000|access-date= 29 October 2019}}</ref>

==Geography==
The city is divided into three urban municipalities: [[Maradi I]], [[Maradi II]] and [[Maradi III]]. Maradi is centred on the ''Grand-marché'', a large daily market of wholesale, retail, and agricultural goods from across south central Niger and also the cross-border trade with Nigeria.<ref>[http://www.resimao.org/html/en/region/market/86Detailed Information on Maradi grand-marché] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213250/http://www.resimao.org/html/en/region/market/86Detailed |date=27 July 2011 }}. RESIMAO West-African Market Information Network. Price Statistics from the official West African Market Price Agencies -online</ref> Some of the districts in the town include Zaria and Sabon Gari in the north, and to the west Mokoya, Dan Gouleye, Bagalam, Yandaka, Maradawa, Hassao and Limantchi.<ref name="Bradt"/>

==Economy==
Maradi is the major transport trade and agricultural hub of Niger's south central Hausa region.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maradi Maradi], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> It lies on the major east–west paved highway which crosses from [[Niamey]] in the west to [[Diffa]] in the far east. It also has an [[Maradi Airport|airport]]. Maradi has long been a merchant city, on the route north from [[Kano (city)|Kano]], Nigeria. This explains why one can use either the [[West African CFA franc]] (Niger's official currency) or the Nigerian [[Naira]] for currency in Maradi.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The city lies in a region known for groundnut cultivation.
