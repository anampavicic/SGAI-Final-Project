'''San Luis''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsan ˈlwis}}) is the capital city of [[San Luis Province]] in the [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo region]] of [[Argentina]]. It is also the seat of the [[Juan Martín de Pueyrredón Department]].

== City information ==

Points of interest in the city include the Park of the Nations, the neoclassical cathedral, a number of museums, including the Dora Ochoa De Masramón Provincial Museum, and examples of colonial architecture. A number of landmarks honour the [[Argentine War of Independence]], as well. Independence Park features an equestrian monument to General [[José de San Martín]], liberator of Argentina, [[Chile]] and [[Perú]]. Nearby Pringles Plaza honours Colonel [[Juan Pascual Pringles]], one of San Martín's chief adjutants and, briefly, Governor of San Luis Province.

Fishing in the nearby [[Lake Potrero de los Funes]], and other locations, is also popular. The [[Sierra de las Quijadas National Park]] is located {{cvt|122|km}} from the city.

==Transport==
[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|National Route 7]] connects San Luis to [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], {{cvt|255|km}} to the west, and [[Buenos Aires]], {{cvt|791|km}} to the east. [[San Luis Airport (Argentina)|San Luis Airport]] is located less than {{cvt|2|miles|order=flip}} north of the city centre, and has regular flights to Buenos Aires.

==History==
San Luis was founded on August 25, 1594, by [[Luis Jufré de Loaysa y Meneses]]. The settlement was later abandoned, and was reestablished in 1632 by [[Martín García Óñez de Loyola|Martín García Oñez de Loyola]] as ''San Luis de Loyola Nueva Medina de Río Seco''.

By the end of the 19th century, San Luis had 7,000 inhabitants, and in 1882 the [[Argentine Great Western Railway]] reached the city on its way to Chile. The following year, work began on the cathedral. The Governor's Executive Building, designed in [[French renaissance architecture]], was completed in 1911. The city's population reached 40,000 in 1960, and grew rapidly afterwards, when light industry and growing numbers of retirees began to migrate to the area; at the {{census-ar|2001}}, its population was 153,322.

Because the city is located at the part of the Sierras Grandes known as ''Punta de los Venados'' (Deer Point), the inhabitants of the city are called ''puntanos''.

==Geography==
San Luis lies at the foot of the [[Sierras de Córdoba|Sierras Grandes]], along the northern bank of the Chorrillos River, and is set on a [[Dry Pampas|dry pampas]] plateau, around {{cvt|730|m}} above sea level.

===Climate===
San Luis has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]) and it closely borders a [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk''). Summers are hot and humid, and winters are cool and dry, with temperatures falling below {{convert|0|C|F|1}} sometimes and [[snow]]falls can occur occasionally. The hottest month, January, has an average temperature of {{convert|24.0|C|F|1}}, and the coldest month, July, has an average of {{convert|8.9|C|F|1}}. The annual average temperature is {{convert|17.4|C|F|1}}.
