'''Gapan''' {{IPA|tl|gɐˈpan|}}, officially the '''City of Gapan''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Gapan}}, [[ilocano language|Ilocano]]: ''Siudad ti Gapan'', [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Ciudad/Lakanbalen ning Gapan''), is a 4th class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 122,968 people.{{PH census|current}}

Gapan is nicknamed the "Footwear Capital of the North" due to the thriving footwear making industry in the city.

==History==
Old records called the town '''Ibon'''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Gapan was founded by the Spanish curates and officials who, in their early occupation, exercised great influence over the people and the things they were doing. History places Gapan as one of the first towns of [[Pampanga]] founded sometime in the middle part of the sixteenth century. Records of the first Catholic mission to the far east indicated that in 1595, Fathers Contres Tendilla, Caballo and Salazar were responsible for clearing the forest which later became a pueblo. In this pueblo, a church, presedencia and residential houses made of bricks and lime were constructed, now the age-old landmarks of the city.

Its foundation in 1595 makes Gapan the oldest town in Nueva Ecija and one of the oldest in the Philippines. It was likewise a big pueblo embracing an area as far as [[Cabanatuan]] in the north, which was its barrio with the name Cabanatuan before it separated in 1750: the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]]s in the East, [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]], [[Bulacan]] in the south and [[Candaba]], [[Pampanga]] in the West. Gapan, along with Aliaga, Cabiao, San Antonio and San Isidro were transferred to the province of Nueva Ecija in 1848. Most of the original settlers in Gapan were Tagalogs from [[Bulacan]] and Morong (Rizal Province) and Kapampangans; other early settlers came from Ilocos and Tayabas (now [[quezon|Quezon Province]]). Gradually as the Spanish power waned and economic progress caught up in the area, the pueblo disintegrated into many pueblos until it remained to comprise only the towns of [[Peñaranda, Nueva Ecija|Peñaranda]], [[General Tinio]] and [[San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija|San Leonardo]] (formerly called Manikling) all of Nueva Ecija province. In fact the Patron Saint Divina Pastora had its origin or residence in Barrio Callos, Peñaranda. In 1982, the Gapan massacre occurred after the Marcos-controlled military killed a family, including children, in the town.<ref>Doyo, Ma. Ceres (Sep 22, 2016). "Martial law massacres". Philippine Daily Inquirer.</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
By virtue of [[Republic Act]] No. 9022 and its ratification in a plebiscite subsequently held on August 25, 2001, Gapan was converted into a [[Cities of the Philippines#City classification|component city]] of [[Nueva Ecija]]. Ernesto L. Natividad became the first city mayor of Gapan.

==Geography==
Gapan is located in the southern part of the province. It is bounded to the north by [[Peñaranda, Nueva Ecija|Peñaranda]] and [[San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija|San Leonardo]], to the east by the [[General Tinio, Nueva Ecija|Gen. Tinio]], to the south by [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]] in neighboring [[Bulacan]] province, and to the west by [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]].

Gapan is {{convert|23|km|sp=us}} from [[Cabanatuan]], {{convert|37|km|sp=us}} from [[Palayan]], and {{convert|93|km|sp=us}} from [[Manila]].

{{stack|float=left|{{PH poverty incidence}}}}
Current major sources of income include farming, slipper making, fishponds, poultry and piggery, and commercial establishments.

The city of Gapan held tremendous promise not only in its natural resources but also in its potentials in agri-base industries and in footwear industries which help sustain its virtual role in agricultural and industrial production. Commercial and trade activities in the city are further accelerated by the influx of financing lending institution and new businesses.

== Transportation ==
Gapan serves many bus companies operating provincial and regional routes. Jeepney operators serve routes within the province with some reaching as far to nearby towns in Nueva Ecija. Much of the city's population rely on public transportation such as tricycles and jeeps to get around the city.

Two main highways serve the city of Gapan: [[Maharlika Highway]] and [[Jose Abad Santos Avenue]]. [[Maharlika Highway]] (or Pan-Philippine Highway) is the main highway traversing the city where most vehicles going to Cagayan Valley pass through. It links Gapan to its nearby city of Cabanatuan and town of San Miguel in the province of Bulacan. It also allows travelers to reach towns of Sta. Rosa and San Leonardo. On the other hand, [[Jose Abad Santos Avenue]] is the highway that links Gapan to the towns of [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]] and [[Cabiao, Nueva Ecija|Cabiao]], where the road continues straightforward, again turning westward then eastward, entering [[Pampanga]], and passes through [[Pampanga River]].

One proposed expressway will pass through Gapan if built: it would be the [[North Luzon East Expressway]] ([[Quezon City]] to Cabanatuan).
