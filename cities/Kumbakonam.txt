'''Kumbakonam''' (formerly spelt as '''Coombaconum''' or '''Combaconum'''),<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Combaconum|volume=6|page=750}}</ref> or '''Kudanthai''', is a city municipal corporation in the [[Thanjavur district]] in the [[States of India|Indian state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is located {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Thanjavur]] and {{convert|282|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Chennai]] and is the headquarters of the [[Kumbakonam taluk]] of Thanjavur district. It is the second largest city in the district after [[Thanjavur]]. The city is bounded by two rivers, the [[Kaveri River]] to the north and [[Arasalar River]] to the south. Kumbakonam is known as a "Temple town" due to the prevalence of a number of [[Hindu temple|temples]] here and is noted for its [[Mahamaham festival]], which happens once in 12 years, attracting people from all over the country.

Kumbakonam dates back to the [[Sangam period]] and was ruled by the [[Early Cholas]], [[Pallavas]], [[Mutharaiyar dynasty]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Pandya]]s, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and the [[Thanjavur Marathas]]. It rose to be a prominent town between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, when it served as a capital of the Medieval Cholas. The city reached the zenith of its prosperity during the [[British Raj]] when it was a prominent centre of European education and Hindu culture; and it acquired the cultural name, the "[[Cambridge]] of [[South India]]". In 1866, Kumbakonam was officially constituted as a municipality, which today comprises 48 wards, making it the second largest local civil body in Thanjavur district. It became a municipal corporation on 24 August 2021.

== Etymology ==
The name "Kumbakonam", roughly translated in English as the "Pot's Corner",<ref name="catholicp710">{{cite book|page=710|title=The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic church, Volume 8|first=Charles George|last=Herbermann|author2=Edward Aloysius Pace |author3=Condé Bénoist Pallen |author4=Thomas Joseph Shahan |author5=John Joseph Wynne |publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia Inc.|year=1934}}</ref> is believed to be an [[allusion]] to the mythical pot (''[[kumbha]]'') of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] that contained the seed of all living beings on earth. The ''kumbha'' is believed to have been displaced by a ''[[pralaya]]'' (dissolution of the universe) and ultimately came to rest at the spot where the town of Kumbakonam now stands. This event is now commemorated in the [[Mahamaham]] festival held every 12 years.

The region around Kumbakonam was inhabited as early as the Sangam Age (third century BC to third century AD). The present-day Kumbakonam is believed to be the site of the ancient town of Kudavayil where the [[Early Chola]] king [[Karikala]] held his court.<ref name="ancienttamilsp88" /> Some scholars identify Kumbakonam as the site of the fabled prison of Kudavayir-kottam where the Chera king Kanaikkal Irumporai was imprisoned by the Early Chola king [[Kocengannan]].<ref name="cholasp72">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 72</ref> Kumbakonam is identified with the town of Malaikūrram<ref name="imperialgazetteerp20">[[#Hunter|Hunter]] 1908, Vol 16, p. 20</ref> which had served as the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] capital as early as the seventh century and with the town of Solamaligai which had also served as a Chola capital.<ref name="southindianshrinesp320" /> According to the Sinnamanur plates, Kumbakonam was the site of a battle between the [[Pallava]] king [[Sri Vallabha]] and the then [[Pandya kingdom|Pandya]] king in 859<ref name="cholasp105">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 105</ref><ref name="saivaartp10">{{cite book|title=Saiva Art and Architecture|page=10|last=C. |first=Krishna Murthy|year=1985|publisher=Sundeep Prakashan}}</ref> and between the Pandya king Srimara Pandya and a confederacy of the Cholas and [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Gangas]].<ref name="southindianshrinesp320" />

Kumbakonam came into the limelight during the rule of the [[Medieval Cholas]] who ruled from the ninth century to the twelfth century.  The town of [[Pazhaiyaarai]], {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Kumbakonam was the capital of the Chola Empire in the ninth century.<ref name="houseofgodp178">{{cite book|title=House of God: select temples of South India|last=N.
