'''Guelph''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Guelph.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|w|ɛ|l|f}} {{respell|GWELF}}; [[2021 Canadian Census]] population 143,740)<ref name="census2021"/> is a city in [[Southwestern Ontario]], Canada. Known as The Royal City, it is roughly {{convert|22|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Downtown Toronto]], at the intersection of [[Ontario Highway 6|Highway 6]], [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]] and Wellington County Road 124. It is the seat of [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]], but is politically [[Independent city|independent]] of it.

Guelph began as a settlement in the 1820s, established by [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]], who was in [[Upper Canada]] as the first superintendent of the [[Canada Company]]. He based the headquarters, and his home, in the community.

Two very successful major mills operated in Guelph for many years in the 1800s. The first was [[Allan's Mill]], first established in 1830 on the Speed River and significantly expanded to include a distillery by the next owners, the Allan family, in the 1850s. This business was extensively damaged by fire in 1876 and ceased operation as a mill; the site was later used by manufacturing companies.

A few years later, George Sleeman Sr. founded an electric radial railway, the Guelph Railway Company, an important part of the history of [[Guelph Transit]]. Only five miles of track had been laid by 1895, but the line was extended in 1902; the radial railway eventually reached Toronto, as the Ontario Hydro Electric Railways - Guelph District (owned by Ontario Hydro).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/elso/guelph.htm|title=Guelph Radial Railway|website=www.trainweb.org|access-date=July 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511035042/http://www.trainweb.org/elso/guelph.htm|archive-date=May 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to carrying passengers, the cars carted coal to heat the Ontario Agricultural College.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Guelph Electric Railway Company |url= http://www.lib.uoguelph.ca/find/find-type-resource/archival-special-collections/sleeman-collection/regional-history/electric-railway |author= <!--Not stated--> |date= 2011 |publisher= University of Guelph |access-date= March 25, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053402/http://www.lib.uoguelph.ca/find/find-type-resource/archival-special-collections/sleeman-collection/regional-history/electric-railway |archive-date= March 23, 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref>

By 1886, telephones were quite common in the city. An April news article described the situation as follows. "Telephones are rapidly being introduced into private homes, where they prove a great convenience.

==Geography==

===Topography and water courses===
Downtown Guelph is situated above the confluence of the [[Speed River]] and the [[Eramosa River]], which have numerous tributaries. The Speed River enters from the north and the Eramosa River from the east; the two rivers meet below downtown and continue southwest, where they merge with the [[Grand River (Ontario)]]. There are also many creeks and smaller rivers creating large tracts of densely forested ravines, and providing ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. The city is built on several [[drumlin]]s and buried waterways, the most notable being an underground creek flowing below the Albion Hotel, once the source of water used to brew beer. Guelph is the largest Canadian city to rely almost entirely on groundwater for its drinking supply, which is sourced from two main aquifers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guelph's water supply |url=https://guelph.ca/living/environment/water/groundwater/ |access-date=October 17, 2023 |website=City of Guelph |language=en-CA}}</ref>

===Climate===
This region of Ontario has cold winters and warm, humid summers, falling into the [[Köppen climate classification]] Dfb zone ([[Humid continental climate|humid continental]]), with moderately high rainfall and snowfall. It is generally a couple of degrees cooler than lower elevation regions on the [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]]s shorelines, especially so in winter, the exception being on some spring afternoons when the lack of an onshore breeze boosts temperatures well above those found lakeside.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Guelph was {{convert|38.3|C}} on August 6, 1918, and July 13, 1936.<ref name="August 1918"/><ref name="July 1936"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-37.2|C}} on January 25, 1884.<ref name="January 1884"/>

==Economy==
The city of Guelph's diversified economy helped Guelph obtain the country's lowest unemployment rate at 4.2 per cent in 2011<ref name="guelphmercury1"/> and at 3.9 per cent in February 2016.<ref name="Young"/> The great diversity in the types of employers is a significant factor too; the city is not dependent on a single industry. The workforce participation rate of 72% was the best in Canada in December 2015 according to BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic. The job growth of more than 9 per cent at the same time was also of great value to the community.<ref>{{cite news |last=Babad |first=Michael |date=January 11, 2016 |title=Welcome to Guelph, Ont., pop. 121,688 and Canada's jobs powerhouse |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/welcome-to-guelph-ont-pop-121688-and-canadas-jobs-powerhouse/article28100361/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |access-date=January 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231152936/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/welcome-to-guelph-ont-pop-121688-and-canadas-jobs-powerhouse/article28100361// |archive-date=December 31, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the time, the BMO economist also rated Guelph as the top city in Canada for those looking for work.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/01/13/best-cities-for-work-canada-bmo_n_8970958.html |title=Canada's Best City To Find A Job?

The overall economy of the Guelph "region" (including the city and the townships of [[Guelph/Eramosa]] and [[Puslinch, Ontario]]) grew at an average of 3.5% per year over the previous five years and was expected to be 2.1% in 2019 and also in 2020 according to the [[Conference Board of Canada]]'s August 2019 report. Guelph's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.6% per cent in 2018, the highest among medium-sized cities in Canada. "Although economic growth is poised to moderate in 2019, Guelph will maintain its place as one of Canada’s economic growth leaders," the report predicted.<ref name="ReferenceD">{{cite news |url=https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/guelph-leads-canadian-medium-sized-cities-in-key-economic-marker-1627473 |title=Guelph leads Canadian medium-sized cities in key economic marker |date=August 7, 2019 |newspaper=[[Guelph Today]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808201701/https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/guelph-leads-canadian-medium-sized-cities-in-key-economic-marker-1627473 |archive-date=August 8, 2019 }}</ref>

===Manufacturing and education sectors===
Manufacturing is the leading sector of the economy of the city with the most significant sector being auto parts manufacturing.<ref name="Young"/> The [[Conference Board of Canada]]'s August 2019 report stated that the Guelph region's manufacturing was experiencing significant growth, averaging 5.9% over the past five years and expected to be 4.2% in 2019.<ref name="ReferenceD"/>

[[Linamar]] is the city's leader in this sector, with 22 manufacturing plants. The company has received government funding for expansion that would create additional jobs, most recently in 2015 ($101 million)<ref>{{cite web |title=Linamar gets $101 million from Ontario, Ottawa, to create 1,200 jobs |date=January 12, 2015 |first=Robert |last=Benzie |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/12/101_government_funds_to_linamar_to_create_1200_jobs.html |access-date=January 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117011805/https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/12/101_government_funds_to_linamar_to_create_1200_jobs.html |archive-date=January 17, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and in 2018 ($99 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/8072818-guelph-s-linamar-to-receive-99-million-from-feds-province/?s=n1|title=Guelph's Linamar to receive $99 million from feds, province|first=Chris|last=Seto|date=January 15, 2018|publisher=Guelph Mercury|access-date=January 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116194141/https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/8072818-guelph-s-linamar-to-receive-99-million-from-feds-province/?s=n1|archive-date=January 16, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The latter would create 1,500 additional jobs and maintain 8,000 others in the Canadian operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/01/15/linamar-to-launch-750-million-expansion-with-help-from-ottawa-ontario.html |title=Linamar to launch $750-million expansion with help from Ottawa, Ontario |publisher=Toronto Star |date=January 15, 2018 |first=Josh |last=Wingrove |access-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730015956/https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/01/15/linamar-to-launch-750-million-expansion-with-help-from-ottawa-ontario.html |archive-date=July 30, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to research completed by the City of Guelph in 2010, fabricated metal product manufacturing accounted for 26.1% of the types of industries, followed by machinery manufacturing for 12.8% and miscellaneous manufacturing for 10.4%.<ref name="guelph.ca"/> The city's '''Economic Development Strategy''' identified [[life science]], agri-food and biotechnology firms, environmental management and technology companies as growth industries on which to focus economic development activities.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Focus on Sectors|publisher=City of Guelph|access-date= March 17, 2008|url=http://www.guelph.ca/business.cfm?subCatID=1350&smocid=1933|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605005127/http://www.guelph.ca/business.cfm?subCatID=1350&smocid=1933|archive-date=June 5, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city also touts the importance of advanced manufacturing which is its largest employer. The roughly 360 businesses of this type employ approximately 14,755 people (roughly 25% of Guelph's labour force). The category includes "high precision manufacturing and auto parts assembly to plastic injection moulding machines manufacturing and automation devices. This enables advanced manufacturing to be a strong driver of the local economy."<ref name="guelph.ca1"/>

The second largest industry is Educational services, accounting for 11.3%.<ref name="guelph.ca">{{cite web |url=http://guelph.ca/uploads/ecdev/2010%20Community%20Profile.pdf |title=City of Guelph 2010 Community Profile |publisher=City of Guelph |archive-date=September 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062452/http://guelph.ca/uploads/ecdev/2010%20Community%20Profile.pdf}}</ref>

More specific data was also provided:

* Violent crime severity index: 49 per 100,000 people compared to 75.25 for the national index.
* Homicide rate: The city had only one homicide in 2016 for a rate of 0.76 per 100,000 people, compared to the national average of 1.68.
* Assault rate: Guelph was at 181.87 versus the national average of 370

* Fraud: This aspect has increased notably since 1996; it was at 260.67 per 100,000 people in 2016, versus the national rate of 299.05.
* Drug offences: The city is well below the national average in all categories. 
* Youth Criminal Justice Act offences: The rate was 8.31 per 100,000 in Guelph, substantially lower than the national average of 16.74.

The 2017 Index showed a 15% increase to 64 per 100,000 people, still well below the national index. Much of the increase was in property crime and sexual assaults. Reporting of the latter type of crimes was up by up 42.7%. This may not indicate the actual increase in the number of sexual assault incidents, as theorized by Chief of Police Jeff DeRuyter. He told a reporter that "We are seeing an increase in sexual assault reporting, and that’s a positive, because we’ve always believed the reporting of sexual assault was under-reported."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/8761239-crime-up-in-guelph-statistics-canada-says/ |title=Crime up in Guelph, Statistics Canada says |date=July 26, 2018 |publisher=Guelph Mercury Tribune |author=Graeme McNaughton |access-date=January 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728110329/https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/8761239-crime-up-in-guelph-statistics-canada-says/ |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Facilities for incarceration===
The Wellington County Jail (in Late Gothic Revival Style) and the Governor's Residence (in Georgian style) at 74 Woolwich Street were built in 1911; they were designated by the city for "historic and architectural value" and as a National Historic Site in 1983.

The first inmates had been transferred to the Guelph reformatory from Toronto's Central Prison when it closed in 1915. By 1910, however, a prison farm beside the Eramosa River had begun receiving prisoners. The farm inmates constructed a concrete bridge, a spur line to the CPR and a wooden trestle bridge. The official opening of the farm was September 25, 1911. By 1912, the various buildings on the site housed 300; the correctional operations on the site were fully operational by 1914. Between 1911 and 1915, prisoners had built the Administration building, the cell blocks, ponds and waterways, dry stone walls, stairs, gates, bridges and terraced gardens.

The farm and Reformatory were used to teach inmates useful skills, including agriculture, dry cleaning, metalworking, and other trades. By the late 1940s the facility produced food for all of Ontario's prisons, and also made blankets, wood and metal products; there was a stone quarry stone on site. By 1962 the prison farm accommodated a dairy, piggery, horses, cattle and vegetable farming.<ref name="Yorklands"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/living-story/9489708-flash-from-the-past-the-prison-farm-changes-the-eramosa-river/ |title=Flash From the Past: The Prison Farm changes the Eramosa River |date=July 5, 2019 |first=Cameron |last=Shelley |website=Kitchenerpost.ca |publisher=Metroland Media |access-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707135800/https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/living-story/9489708-flash-from-the-past-the-prison-farm-changes-the-eramosa-river/ |archive-date=July 7, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The farm area eventually included barns, a woolen mill, abattoir, tailor shop, laundry, bakery, metal shop, broom shop and other facilities.

In June 2019, 328.6 acres of the land, including 100 acres of natural area, still owned by the province, went on sale. The City of Guelph had not bought the site for the planned Guelph Innovation District, as it had initially considered doing, because of the potential financial risk. A rough estimate in 2017 by the city had suggested that the value of the Detention Centre site was roughly $60 million. The property for sale included the Wellington Detention Centre lands and the nearby Turfgrass Institute but not the buildings or land immediately around the former penal institution.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/guelph-innovation-district-lands-officially-on-the-market-1502630 |title=Guelph Innovation District lands officially on the market |date=June 12, 2019 |first=Tony |last=Saxon |website=Guelphtoday.com |access-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707143128/https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/guelph-innovation-district-lands-officially-on-the-market-1502630 |archive-date=July 7, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Media==

===Online media===
GuelphToday.com is an online local news source in Guelph, offering the latest breaking news, weather updates, entertainment, sports and business features, obituaries and more.

===Print media===
The earliest newspaper published in Guelph was the ''Guelph Herald'', which lasted for nine months after it was started in 1842 by Charles McDonnell. The ''Wellingtonian'' also lasted for only a short time in 1843. The next one to be published was ''The Advertiser'' in 1845. In 1847, the new ''Guelph Herald'' was established as a weekly.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/canada/guelph/guelphbook.pdf|title=Guelph: A People's Heritage 1827-2002|first=Hilary|last=Stead|page=13|access-date=July 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302021902/https://www.electricscotland.com/Canada/guelph/guelphbook.pdf|archive-date=March 2, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Both of those publications disappeared but the city was served by a daily newspaper for 149 years until the [[Guelph Mercury]] ceased operations in January 2016 due to declining subscriptions and revenues.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/guelph-mercury-to-close-amid-financial-pressures/article28370737/ |title=Guelph Mercury newspaper to close amid financial pressures |date=January 25, 2016 |first1=Tim |last1=Shufelt |first2=Christine |last2=Dobby |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=July 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053324/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/guelph-mercury-to-close-amid-financial-pressures/article28370737// |archive-date=March 16, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the time, it was owned by [[Metroland Media Group]] which also owned the Guelph Tribune, a twice weekly publication with limited news coverage.
