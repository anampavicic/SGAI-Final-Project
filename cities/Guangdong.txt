The two [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] fall within the scope of Guangdong's cultural influence, and its culture still has profound influences on the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] in [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singapore]] and [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]], with the vast majority of the Chinese diaspora in the two countries claiming ancestry from Guangdong.

== Name ==
"''Guǎng''" ({{zh|first=t|t=廣|s=广}}) means "wide" or "vast", and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226.<ref>{{cite book |title=Regional China: A Business and Economic Handbook |year=2013 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |author=Rongxing Gao |page=77 |isbn=9781137287670}}</ref> The name "''Guang''" ultimately came from Guangxin ({{zh|labels=no|first=t|t={{linktext|廣信}} |s=广信}}), an outpost established in [[Han dynasty]] near modern [[Wuzhou]], whose name is a reference to an order by [[Emperor Wu of Han]] to "widely bestow favors and sow trust".

[[File:Kwangtung Provincial Government.jpg|thumb|Kwangtung Provincial Government of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]]]

===Prehistory===
The [[Neolithic]] era began in the [[Pearl River Delta]] ({{Lang|zh|珠江三角洲}}) 7,000 years before present (BP), with the early period from around 7000 to 5000 BP (c. 5050–3050 BC), and the late period from about 5000 to 3500 BP (c. 3050–1550 BC). In coastal Guangdong, the Neolithic was likely introduced from the middle Yangtze River area (Jiao 2013). In inland Guangdong, the neolithic appeared in Guangdong 4,600 years before present (BP). The Neolithic in northern inland Guangdong is represented by the Shixia culture ({{Lang|zh|石峽文化}}), which occurred from 4600 to 4200 BP (c. 2650–2250 BC).<ref>Jiao, Tianlong. 2013. "The Neolithic Archaeology of Southeast China." In Underhill, Anne P., et al. ''A Companion to Chinese Archaeology'', 599–611. Wiley-Blackwell.</ref>

===Imperial===
Originally inhabited by a mixture of tribal groups known to the Chinese as the [[Baiyue]] ("Hundred Yue"), the region first became part of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Under the Qin Dynasty, Chinese administration began and along with it reliable historical records in the region. After establishing the first [[Qin's wars of unification|unified Chinese empire]], the Qin expanded southwards and set up [[Nanhai Commandery]] at [[Panyu District|Panyu]], near what is now part of Guangzhou. The region was an independent kingdom as [[Nanyue]] between the fall of Qin and the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]]. The [[Han dynasty]] administered Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam as [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhi Province]]; southernmost Jiaozhi Province was used as a gateway for traders from the west—as far away as the Roman Empire. Under the [[Eastern Wu|Wu Kingdom]] of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, Guangdong was made its own province, the Guang Province, in 226 CE.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Canton was a prosperous port city along a tropical frontier region beset by disease and wild animals, but rich in oranges, [[banyan]], bananas, and [[lychee]] fruits.

The port's importance declined after it was raided by Arabs and Persians in 758 and the foreign residents were at times troubled by the corrupt local officials, sometimes responding violently.

Together with [[Guangxi]], Guangdong was made part of [[Lingnan culture|Lingnan]] Circuit (political division Circuit), or Mountain-South Circuit, in 627 during the [[Tang dynasty]].

As time passed, the demographics of what is now Guangdong gradually shifted to ([[Han people|Han]]){{when|date=February 2020}} Chinese dominance as the populations intermingled due to commerce along the great canals. From the fall of the Han dynasty onwards, it shifted more abruptly through massive migration from [[Northern China|the north]] during periods of political turmoil and nomadic incursions. For example, internal strife in northern China following [[An Lushan Rebellion|the rebellion]] of [[An Lushan]] resulted in a 75% increase in the population of Guangzhou prefecture between the 740s–750s and 800s–810s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhyz.org/yxx/jxzy/zy/zy48.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030529135953/http://www.nhyz.org/yxx/jxzy/zy/zy48.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 May 2003 |title=nhyz.org |publisher=nhyz.org |access-date=25 April 2012 }}</ref> As more migrants arrived, the local population was gradually [[Sinicization|assimilated to Han Chinese culture]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11836649 |title=  Phylogeographic differentiation of mitochondrial DNA in Han Chinese|journal=  The American Journal of Human Genetics|date= March 2002|doi=10.1086/338999 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pmc=384943 |pages=635–51|last1=  Yao|first1=  Yong-Gang|last2=  Kong|first2=  Qing-Peng|last3=  Bandelt|first3=  Hans-Jürgen|last4=  Kivisild|first4=  Toomas|last5=  Zhang|first5=  Ya-Ping}}</ref> or displaced.

As [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|Mongols]] from the north engaged in their [[Mongol conquest of China|conquest of China]] in the 13th century, the [[Southern Song]] court fled southwards from its capital in [[Hangzhou]].

During the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], large parts of current Guangdong belonged to [[Jiangxi]].<ref>Zhang Tingyu, et al. (1739). "[[History of Ming]]".

Since the 16th century, Guangdong has had extensive trade links with the rest of the world. European merchants coming northwards via the [[Straits of Malacca]] and the [[South China Sea]], particularly the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and British, traded extensively through Guangzhou. [[Macau]], on the southern coast of Guangdong, was the first European settlement in 1557.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the 19th century, the [[opium trade]]d through Guangzhou triggered the [[First Opium War]], opening an era of Western imperialists' incursion and intervention in China. In addition to [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], which was then a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]], Hong Kong was ceded to the British, and [[Leased Territory of Guangzhouwan|Kouang-Tchéou-Wan]] (modern day area of [[Zhanjiang]]) to the [[French colonial empire|French]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Due to the large number of people that emigrated out of the Guangdong province, and in particular the ease of immigration from Hong Kong to other parts of the [[British Empire]] (later [[British Commonwealth]]), many overseas Chinese communities have their origins in Guangdong and/or Cantonese culture. In particular, the [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] dialects have proportionately more speakers among overseas Chinese people than Mandarin-speaking Chinese. Additionally, many Taishanese-speaking Chinese [[Chinese emigration|emigrated]] to Western countries, with the results that many Western versions of Chinese words were derived from the Cantonese dialects rather than through the mainstream Mandarin language, such as "[[dim sum]]".   Some Mandarin Chinese words originally of foreign origin also came from the original foreign language by way of Cantonese. For example, the Mandarin word ''{{transliteration|zh|níngméng}}'' ({{zh|s=柠檬|t=檸檬}}), meaning "Lemon", came from Cantonese, in which the characters are pronounced as ''{{transliteration|zh|lìng mung}}''.<ref>{{cite book

During the 1850s, the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], whose leader [[Hong Xiuquan]] was born in Guangdong and received a pamphlet from a Protestant Christian missionary in Guangdong, was allied with a local Guangdong [[Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856)]]. Because of direct contact with the West, Guangdong was the centre of anti-Manchu and anti-imperialist activity. The generally acknowledged founder of modern China, [[Sun Yat-sen]], was also from Guangdong.

===20th century===
During the early 1920s of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], Guangdong was the staging area for the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) to prepare for the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], an effort to bring the various [[warlord era|warlords]] of China back under a unified central government. The [[Whampoa Military Academy]] was built near Guangzhou to train military commanders.

At the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] Guangdong became one of the [[Nationalist government]]'s final footholds in [[Mainland China]], with Guangzhou temporarily serving as the [[Kuomintang]]'s provisional capitol. The [[People's Liberation Army]] seized control of the province after the [[retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dikötter |first=Frank |title=The Tragedy of Liberation: A History of the Chinese Revolution, 1945–1957 |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-62040-347-1 |edition=1 |location=London |pages=31–32}}</ref>

The new [[Chinese Communist Party]] administration issued harsh taxes, requisitioning between 22 and 60 percent of grain annually. However, the local party boss Fang Fang tried to moderate [[Land Reform Movement (China)|Chinese land reform policy]] in order to protect successful businesses in the [[Pearl River Delta]], landholdings by [[overseas Chinese]] seeking to eventually return to the country, and commercial relations with [[British Hong Kong]]. In response [[Mao Zedong]] purged Fang and thousands of cadres from the province in 1952, sending [[Tao Zhu]] to implement a much harsher program under the slogan "Every Village Bleeds, Every Household Fights."{{Sfn|Dikötter|2013|p=76-81}}

It is now the province with the highest gross domestic product in China.

In 1952, a small section of Guangdong's coastline ([[Qinzhou]], Lianzhou (now [[Hepu County]]), [[Fangchenggang]] and [[Beihai]]) was given to Guangxi, giving it access to the sea. This was reversed in 1955, and then restored in 1965. [[Hainan]] Island was originally part of Guangdong, but it was separated into its own province in 1988.

After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] and until the start of the [[Deng Xiaoping]] reforms in 1978, Guangdong was an economic backwater, although a large underground, service-based economy has always existed. Economic development policies encouraged industrial development in the interior provinces which were weakly joined to [[Transport in Guangdong|Guangdong via transportation links]]. The government policy of economic [[autarky]] made Guangdong's access to the ocean irrelevant.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Deng Xiaoping's open door policy radically changed the economy of the province as it was able to take advantage of its access to the ocean, proximity to Hong Kong, and historical links to [[overseas Chinese]].

Guangdong's economic boom began with the early 1990s and has since spread to neighboring provinces, and also pulled their populations inward.

Guangdong officially became the [[List of People's Republic of China administrative divisions by population|most populous province]] in 2005.<ref name="English people.com.cn"/><ref name="Chinadaily.com"/> Official statistics had traditionally placed Guangdong as the fourth-most populous province of China with about 80&nbsp;million people, though an influx of migrants, temporary workers, and newly settled individuals numbered around 30&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.163.com/05/0201/11/1BGKCSFN0014183O.html |title=media163 |publisher=media163 |access-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625190924/http://media.163.com/05/0201/11/1BGKCSFN0014183O.html |archive-date=25 June 2012 }}</ref> The massive influx of migrants from other provinces, dubbed the "floating population", is due to Guangdong's booming economy and high demand for labor. If Guangdong were an independent nation, it would rank among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|twelfth largest countries of the world by population]].

===Urbanization===
[[File:Guangzhou skyline.jpg|{{center|[[Guangzhou]] is the third largest city in the People's Republic of China.}}|left|thumb]]
In 2021, Guangdong's population is 74.6% urban and 25.4% rural.<ref name="data2022"/>

===Genealogy===
Guangdong is the ancestral home of large numbers of [[overseas Chinese]]. Most of the railroad laborers in [[Canada]], the [[Western United States]] and [[Panama]] in the 19th century came from Guangdong, especially the [[Siyi]] area. Many people from the region also traveled to [[California]] and other parts of the [[United States]] during the [[California Gold Rush|gold rush of 1849]], and also to [[Colonial Australia|Australia]] during its [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] a decade or so later.

===Languages and ethnicities===
The majority of the province's population is [[Han Chinese]]. Within the Han Chinese, the largest subgroup in Guangdong are the [[Cantonese people]]. Two other major groups are the [[Teochew people]] in [[Chaoshan]] and the [[Hakka people]] in [[Huizhou]], [[Meizhou]], [[Heyuan]], [[Shaoguan]] and [[Zhanjiang]]. [[Shaozhou Tuhua]] is spoken in [[Shaoguan]] and [[Leizhou Min]] is spoken in the Leizhou Peninsula. There is a small [[Yao people|Yao]] population in the north. Other smaller [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|minority groups]] include [[She people|She]], [[Hmong people|Miao]], [[Li Chinese|Li]], and [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]].

===Gender ratio===
Guangdong has a highly unbalanced gender ratio that is among the highest of all provinces in China. According to a 2009 study published in [[The BMJ|''The British Medical Journal'']], in the 1–4 age group, there are over 130 boys for every 100 girls.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1211.full |title=China's excess males, sex selective abortion, and one child policy: analysis of data from 2005 national intercensus survey – Zhu et al. 338 |journal=BMJ |date=9 April 2009 |volume=338 |pages=b1211 |publisher=bmj.com |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1211 |access-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101005559/http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1211.full |archive-date=1 January 2012 |last1=Zhu |first1=Wei Xing |last2=Lu |first2=Li |last3=Hesketh |first3=Therese |pmid=19359290 |pmc=2667570 }}</ref>

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Guangdong}}
{{Main list|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}

Guangdong is governed by a one-party system like the rest of China. The [[Governor of Guangdong|Governor]] is in charge of provincial affairs; however, the Communist Party Secretary, often from outside of Guangdong, keeps the Governor in check.

=== Dissent ===
According to [[Freedom House]]'s China Dissent Monitor, Guangdong accounted for 17% of dissent events in the first quarter of 2024 – over 100 events despite heavy [[Censorship in China]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/china-dissent-monitor/2024/issue-7-january-march-2024|title= China Dissent Monitor 2024 Issue 7: January – March 2024{{!}} Freedom House|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2024-05-28}}</ref> In 2024, Freedom House rated China as below zero on political rights (−2 out of 40).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2024|title=Freedom in the World 2024: China{{!}} Freedom House|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2024-05-28}}</ref>

=== Relations with Hong Kong and Macau ===
[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], while historically parts of Guangdong before becoming colonies of the United Kingdom and Portugal, respectively, are [[Special administrative region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] (SARs). Furthermore, the [[Basic Law]]s of both SARs explicitly forbid [[Provinces of China|provincial governments]] from intervening in local politics. As a result, many issues with Hong Kong and Macau, such as border policy and water rights, have been settled by negotiations between the SARs' governments and the [[Government of Guangdong|Guangdong provincial government]].

== Media ==
Guangdong and the greater Guangzhou area are served by several [[Radio Guangdong]] stations, [[Guangdong Television]], [[Southern Television Guangdong]], [[Shenzhen Television]], and [[Guangzhou Television]]. There is an English programme produced by [[Radio Guangdong]] which broadcasts information about this region to the entire world through the [[WRN Broadcast]].

== Culture ==

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
[[File:3 pieces of har gow at Plum Blossom Room 20230125.jpg|thumb|The [[har gow]] are classical Cantonese dumplings served as dim sum.]]
The central region, which is also the political and economic center, is populated predominantly by [[Yue Chinese]] speakers, though the influx in the last three decades of millions of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking immigrants has slightly diminished Cantonese linguistic dominance. This region is associated with [[Cantonese cuisine]]. [[Dim sum|Dim Sum]] is one famous example of Cantonese cuisine, dividing Cantonese food into small portions and served with small dishes. [[Cantonese opera]] is a form of [[Chinese opera]] popular in Cantonese speaking areas. Related Yue dialects are spoken in most of the western half of the province.

The area comprising the cities of [[Chaozhou]], [[Shantou]] and [[Jieyang]] in coastal east Guangdong, known as [[Chaoshan]], forms its own cultural sphere. The [[Teochew people]] here, along with [[Hailufeng dialect|Hailufeng Min]] people in [[Shanwei]], speak [[Hokkien]], which is a [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect closely related to mainstream [[Hokkien|Southern Min]] (Hokkien) and their cuisine is [[Chiuchow cuisine|Teochew cuisine]]. [[Teochew opera]] is also well-known and has a unique form.

The [[Hakka people]] live in large areas of Guangdong, including [[Huizhou]], [[Meizhou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Heyuan]], [[Shaoguan]] and other areas. Much of the Eastern part of Guangdong is populated by the Hakka people except for the Chaozhou and Hailufeng area. Hakka culture include [[Hakka cuisine]], Han opera ({{zh|s=汉剧 |t=漢劇}}), Hakka ''Hanyue'' and ''sixian'' (traditional instrumental music) and Hakka folk songs ({{lang|zh|客家山歌}}).
[[File:Puning, Jieyang, Guangdong, China - panoramio (123).jpg|thumb|Jieyang architecture]]
The outcast [[Tanka people]] traditionally live on boats throughout the coasts and rivers of Guangdong and much of Southern China.

[[Zhanjiang]] in southern Guangdong is dominated by the [[Leizhou Min|Leizhou dialect]], a variety of [[Min language|Minnan]]; Cantonese and Hakka are also spoken there.

Mandarin is the language used in education and government and in areas where there are migrants from other provinces, above all in Shenzhen. Cantonese maintains a strong and dominant position in common usage and media, even in eastern areas of the province where the local languages and dialects are non-Yue ones.

Guangdong Province is notable for being the birthplace of many famous [[Xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) grandmasters such as [[Lü Qin]], Yang Guanli, Cai Furu and [[Xu Yinchuan]].

== Education and research ==
As of 2022, Guangdong hosts 160 institutions of higher education, ranking first in [[South Central China]] region and 2nd among all Chinese provinces/municipalities after [[Jiangsu]] (168).<ref name=":02"/> Guangdong is also the seat of 14 adult higher education institutions.<ref name=":02" /> Many universities and colleges are located in major cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, hosts 83 institutions of higher education (excluding adult colleges), ranking 1st in [[South China]] region and 2nd (tie) nationwide after [[Beijing]].<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2022-08-04 |title=Top 10 Chinese cities with most higher education institutions |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202208/04/WS62eaf941a310fd2b29e7022c.html |access-date=2022-08-05 |website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}</ref> [[Guangdong Province Department of Education]] is the department of the provincial government that oversees education.

As of 2023, two major cities in the province ranked in the top [[List of cities by scientific output|20 cities]] in the world (Guangzhou 8th and Shenzhen 19th) by scientific research output, as tracked by the [[Nature Index]].<ref name="nature.com"/>
