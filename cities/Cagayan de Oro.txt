'''Cagayan de Oro''' ('''CDO'''), officially the '''City of Cagayan de Oro''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Cagayan de Oro}}; {{lang-mrw|Bandar a Cagayan de Oro}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Cagayan de Oro}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] of [[Northern Mindanao]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 728,402 people, making it the [[List of cities in the Philippines|10th most populous city]] in the Philippines and the most populous in Northern Mindanao.{{PH census|current}}{{PH census|2015}}

It serves as the capital of the [[Philippine provinces|province]] of [[Misamis Oriental]] wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but governed administratively independent from the provincial government and also the largest city of that province. It also serves as the regional center and business hub of Northern Mindanao, and part of the growing [[Metro Cagayan de Oro|Metropolitan Cagayan de Oro]] area, which includes the city of [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador]], the towns of [[Opol, Misamis Oriental|Opol]], [[Alubijid, Misamis Oriental|Alubijid]], [[Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental|Laguindingan]], [[Gitagum, Misamis Oriental|Gitagum]], [[Lugait, Misamis Oriental|Lugait]], [[Naawan, Misamis Oriental|Naawan]], [[Initao, Misamis Oriental|Initao]], [[Libertad, Misamis Oriental|Libertad]] and [[Manticao, Misamis Oriental|Manticao]] at the western side, and the towns of [[Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental|Tagoloan]], [[Villanueva, Misamis Oriental|Villanueva]], [[Jasaan, Misamis Oriental|Jasaan]], [[Claveria, Misamis Oriental|Claveria]] and [[Balingasag, Misamis Oriental|Balingasag]] at the eastern side.

Cagayan de Oro is located along the north central coast of [[Mindanao]] island facing [[Macajalar Bay]] and is bordered by the municipalities of [[Opol, Misamis Oriental|Opol]] to the west, [[Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental|Tagoloan]] to the east, and the provinces of [[Bukidnon]] and [[Lanao del Norte]] to the south of the city.

Cagayan de Oro is also famous for its [[white water rafting]] or [[kayaking]] adventures, one of the tourism activities being promoted along the [[Cagayan River (Cagayan de Oro)|Cagayan de Oro River]].<ref name="Philpost 1">{{cite web | url=http://www.philpost.gov.ph/web/cagayan-de-oros-white-water-rafting/ | title=Cagayan de Oro's White Water Rafting | publisher=[[Philippine Postal Corporation]] | date=June 18, 2012 | access-date=September 13, 2012  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729194732/http://www.philpost.gov.ph/web/cagayan-de-oros-white-water-rafting/ | archive-date=July 29, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Travel Guide Cagayan de Oro">[http://www.panamacrawler.com/travelguides/Cagayan_de_Oro.html Cagayan De Oro Travel Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002183144/http://www.panamacrawler.com/travelguides/Cagayan_de_Oro.html |date=October 2, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Philippine Government Website article on President Arroyo's Whitewater rafting activity in CDO">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222140/http://www.gov.ph/news/default.asp?i=1333 GMA goes whitewater rafting in Cagayan de Oro – and looks forward to mountain climbing : Philippines : Gov.Ph : News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Etymology==

The name ''Cagayan de Oro'' (lit. River of Gold)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elson.elizaga.net/articles/meaning-of-cagayan.html|title=The Meaning of Cagayan|first1=Elson T. |last1=Elizaga|first2=Lawrence A.|last2=Reid|website=elson.elizaga.net|access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> can be traced back to the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Augustinian Recollect]] friars in 1622, the area around Himologan (now Huluga), was already known as "Cagayán". Early Spanish written documents in the 16th century already referred to the place as "Cagayán". Variations of this word—''karayan'', ''kayan'', ''kahayan'', ''kayayan'', ''kagayan'' and ''kalayan''—all also mean ''river.''

The region of [[Northern Mindanao]], which included Cagayan de Oro, was granted as ''encomienda'' to a certain Don Juan Griego on January 25, 1571. It was then former Vice President of the Philippines [[Emmanuel Peláez]] who appended "''de Oro"'' to ''Cagayan''.

The name "[[Cagayan (disambiguation)|''Cagayan'']]" is shared by other places in the Philippines; these include the province of [[Cagayan]] in [[Cagayan Valley]], northern [[Luzon]]–in which is said to have similar reference with Cagayan de Oro as they refer to their respective rivers with the same name (one being the [[Cagayan River|longest in the Philippines]]), the [[Cagayancillo|Cagayan Islands]] in the northern Sulu Sea, and the former Cagayan de Sulu, currently named [[Mapun]], an island in [[Tawi-Tawi]].

==History==

===Classical period===
The Cagayan de Oro area was continuously inhabited by [[Late Neolithic]] to [[Iron Age]] [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] cultures. The oldest human remains discovered was from the [[Huluga Caves]], once used as a burial place by the natives. A skullcap sent to the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in 1977 was dated to be from between 350 and 377 AD.

The caves have yielded numerous artifacts, but most areas have been badly damaged by [[guano]] collectors and amateur [[treasure hunter]]s. Associated with the cave is the Huluga Open Site, believed to be the site of the primary pre-colonial settlement in the region identified as  "Himologan" by the first Spanish missionaries.<ref name="montalvan">{{cite web | url=http://heritage.elizaga.net/history/ | title=History of Cagayan de Oro | publisher=Heritage Conservation Advocates | date=October 16, 2009 | access-date=September 13, 2012 | author=Montalvan, Antonio J.

The discovery of a grave site in 2009 uncovered remains of [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD) [[celadon ware]] and [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai period]] (1238–1347 AD) [[Sangkhalok ceramic ware]], in addition to body ornaments and stone tools. It indicates that the region was part of the [[Austronesian maritime trade network|ancient maritime trading network of Southeast Asia]]. Skulls recovered from the sites show that native Kagay-anons practiced [[artificial cranial deformation]] since childhood as a mark of social status, similar to skulls from archeological sites in neighboring [[Butuan]].<ref name="Montalvan2">{{cite news |last1=Montalvan |first1=Antonio J.

The Huluga Open Site was extensively damaged in 2001 to give way to a bridge project by the local administration. It was the source of controversy when a team from the [[University of the Philippines]]-Archaeological Studies Program dismissed the archeological importance of the site by declaring it as a "camp-like area" and not a settlement and thus not worthy of heritage protection under the laws. It was alleged by local conservationists that the UP-ASP team were influenced by the local government so the bridge project could continue. The site is still not protected and continues to be quarried, despite protests by local historians and archeologists.<ref name="Ostique"/><ref name="Elizaga2018">{{cite news |last1=Elizaga |first1=Elson |title=Dr. Erlinda M.

===Colonial period===

====Spanish period====
The Himologan settlement was still occupied by the time the Europeans made contact. In 1622, two [[Spain|Spanish]] Augustinian Recollect missionaries reached the settlement and described it as being inhabited by a mixed stock descended from highlander [[Bukidnon]] [[Lumad]] and sea-faring [[Visayans]] ("Dumagat"). They described the men of the settlement as being [[tattoo]]ed like other Visayans and the women as being ornamented with intricate jewelry, some of which were golden. They also identified them as [[animist]]s, practicing traditional [[anitism]], though they paid tribute to [[Muhammad Kudarat]], the [[sultan]] of the Islamized [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] to the south.<ref name="montalvan"/>

In 1626, Fray Agustín de San Pedro persuaded the chief of Himologan, [[Datu]] Salangsang, to transfer his settlement down the Cagayan River, to the present-day Gaston Park. De San Pedro later fortified the new settlement against Sultan Kudarat's raiders.

In 1738, Spanish dominance was felt in Cagayan de Oro. When Misamis gained the status of province in 1818, one of its four districts was the Partidos de Cagayan. In 1871, the "Partidos" became a town and was made a permanent capital of Misamis.

On February 27, 1872, Governor-General [[Carlos María de la Torre y Navacerrada|Carlos María de La Torre]] issued a decree declaring Cagayan the permanent capital of ''Segundo Distrito de Misamis''. During this era, the name of the town was known as ''Cagayan de Misamis''.

In 1883, the town became a seat of the Spanish government in [[Mindanao]] for the provinces of [[Misamis Oriental]], [[Misamis Occidental]], [[Bukidnon]] and [[Lanao del Norte]].

The Spanish authorities surrendered to [[Governor of Misamis Oriental|Misamis governor]] Jose Roa and municipal mayor Toribio Chavez, both appointees of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. With the ''Fiesta Nacional'' of January 10–11, 1899, their independence was celebrated as the [[Philippine flag]] was raised for the second time in [[Mindanao]].<ref name="eraUS" /> At that time, the town joined the Aguinaldo government in the second time it was declared.

====American period====
[[File:Americans attacking Macahambus Gorge probably Dec 18-21 1900.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Army|American]] forces attacking Makahambus, circa 1900s.]]

[[Restoration (Spain)|Spain's]] cession of the Philippines to the [[United States]] through [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|a peace treaty in 1898]] mainly caused opposition from residents of then Cagayan de Misamis. Their involvement in the [[Philippine–American War]] was prompted by the presence of the Americans, who had invaded the municipality on March 31, 1900, and whom they fought against thrice since then.<ref name="eraUS">{{cite web |url=https://www.metrocdo.com/2023/08/07/philippine-american-war-sites-to-visit-in-cagayan-de-oro/ |title=Philippine-American War Sites to Visit in Cagayan de Oro |date=August 7, 2023 |website=Metro Cagayan de Oro |publisher= |access-date=March 16, 2024}}</ref>

Resistance fighters lost in the early battles. On April 7, Gen.

After the troubled years, peace finally brought back the economic activities to normality under the guidance of the United States. Consequently, from a purely farming-fishing area, Cagayan de Oro emerged into a booming commerce and trade center, attracting migrants from [[Luzon]] and [[Visayas]] to settle in the area.

Americans gave the Philippines its independence on July 4, 1946.<ref name="Bibingka1">{{cite web | url=http://www.bibingka.com/phg/misc/july4not.htm | title=The Independence Day That Wasn't | publisher=Philippine History Group of Los Angeles | work=Philippine Centennial Series | date=July 4, 1996 | access-date=September 13, 2012 | author=Berlow, Alan  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828115509/http://www.bibingka.com/phg/misc/july4not.htm | archive-date=August 28, 2012 }}</ref>

====Japanese period and second American period====
On May 3, 1942, American and Philippine forces fought heroically against invading Japanese forces from Panay. Unable to resist the overwhelming and the better supplied Japanese, the allied forces retreated to more defensible positions outside the city. The Japanese burned most of the city and took up residence at the [[Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan|Ateneo de Cagayan University]], now Xavier University Grade School and used the ferry crossing near San Agustin Church. In addition, the Japanese also established at least three (likely more) "comfort stations" in the city, where enslaved local girls and teenagers were forced by Japanese soldiers into sexual slavery, which included routine gang-rapes and murders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/29/939811000/philippine-survivor-recounts-her-struggle-as-a-comfort-woman-for-wartime-japan|title=Philippine Survivor Recounts Her Struggle As A 'Comfort Woman' For Wartime Japan|newspaper=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=15 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IsBB-RVTlQC&dq=comfort+gay+philippines+japan&pg=PR9|title=The Other Empire: Literary Views of Japan from the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia|year=2008|publisher=The University of the Philippines Press|isbn=978-971-542-562-9|access-date=15 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.awf.or.jp/e1/philippine-00.html | title=Women made to be Comfort Women - Philippines }}</ref>

The Japanese army implemented a scorch-earth policy. Filipino and American guerrilla forces fought back during this occupation and American planes bombed both the university and San Agustin church on October 10, 1944. The Japanese were never able to successfully move outside the city for any length of time due to the constant pressure and attacks from the Philippine resistant movement. Combined American and Free Philippine forces landed in Cagayan de Oro on May 10, 1945, three years and 7 days after the Japanese occupation.

During this period the Japanese committed many atrocities against the local population of Cagayan de Oro, as they did throughout the Philippines. Colonel Fumio Suzuki and two hundred of his men escaped capture during the liberation of the city and withdrew into the mountainous jungle. They were caught two years later; only 38 survived, by cannibalizing the Higaonon tribal people. At least 70 people were eaten.

A Cagayanon, the physician [[Antonio Julian Montalvan]], was a member of an espionage team working for the return of Gen. Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines. Later, he became part of a Manila spy network. He was captured, tortured and decapitated by the Japanese.

===Former municipalities as oldest barangays===
Iponan, Gusa and Agusan, the city's oldest [[barangay]]s,<ref name="3brgys">{{cite news |date=November 3, 2013 |title=Our three oldest barangays |url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph/story/more-articles/our-three-oldest-barangays |newspaper=[[SunStar]] |location=[[Philippines]] |access-date=March 15, 2024}}</ref> were once municipalities during the colonial period.<ref name="A951" /><ref name="gs1" />

Iponan and Agusan, along with Bayug, Gompot (Balingasag), and Tagoloan, were among the ''visitas'' established by the [[Recollects|Recollect missionaries]] in Cagaiang (city's former name) in 1674.<ref name="3brgys" /> The two were under Partido de Cagayan as [[Misamis (province)|the then-undivided Misamis]] was partitioned into four ''partidos'' in 1818.<ref name="3brgys" />

Iponan was made into a separate parish in 1833. The three became ''visitas'' of then Cagayan de Misamis, which became the new provincial capital in 1871.<ref name="3brgys" />

'''Gusa''' was established as a ''[[barrio]]'' in 1771, and shortly, became a municipality.<ref name="gs1">{{cite web |url=https://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph/HD01/p28/cm1/b15/1.pdf |title=History and cultural life of the Barrio (page 1 of 4) |last=Obuga |first=Roberto |date=n.d. |publisher= |access-date=March 15, 2024 |via=TechnoAklatan, [[National Library of the Philippines]]}}</ref> Original settlers were [[Bukidnon people|Bukidnons]], as well as few [[Manobo people|Manobos]] and [[Moro people|Moros]],<ref name="gs1" /> who came from ''barrio'' Lapasan and town of Cagayan;<ref name="gs2" /> but the increase of immigrants later resulted in all of the natives leaving the area.<ref name="gs1" /> At the time of [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|the American occupation]], during the [[Philippine–American War]], in 1901, Gen.

'''Agusan''' became one of the ten ''barrios'' of Cagayan in 1844. It was the starting point for those traveling to [[Bukidnon]] until the late 1920s. On May 14, 1900, the 1st Company of the Mindanao Battalion perished in [[Battle of Agusan Hill|a battle]] against the Americans on the hills near the river. On May 10, 1945, the beaches of Agusan and Bugo were the landing sites of the soldiers of the [[United States Army]]'s [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]], which joined with that of the [[31st Infantry Division (United States)|31st Division]] in Bukidnon where they finally defeated the Japanese in a battle.<ref name="3brgys" />

'''Iponan''' (spelled "Yponan" in Spanish colonial records), originally called ''Kalumpang'', was the place where there were streams meeting at one point to form Iponan River which, according to a report of British explorer [[Thomas Forrest (navigator)|Thomas Forrest]], was considered as among the [[Mindanao]]'s seven rivers abundant with gold; with a ''[[sitio]]'', known for its gold mines, frequently raided by Moros during [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|the Spanish occupation]].<ref name="3brgys" />

Through ''Act No. 951'', issued by the [[Philippine Commission]] on October 21, 1903, which reduced the number of municipalities in Misamis from 24 to 10, the territories of ''Barrio'' Gusa, along with the towns of Iponan, Opol, Salvador, and Alubijid, joined with Cagayan; while the rest of Agusan joined with [[Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental|Tagoloan]].<ref name="A951">{{cite web |url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20951 |title=Act No. 951 |date=October 21, 1903 |website=Legislative Digital Resources |publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 11, 2024}}</ref> Agusan, later a ''barrio'', along with Bogo and Alae, were transferred from Tagoloan to the newly-converted Cagayan de Oro City in 1950.<ref name="Philippine Law Info 3" />

===Martial law era===
{{see also|Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos}}
During the martial law era, Cagayan de Oro was not spared from military bombings and the usage of brutal mechanisms against dissenters of the Marcos regime. By the time martial law ended, more than a thousand people from the city had been tortured, raped, electrocuted, or salvaged.<ref name="CityWebsiteHistoricalProfile"/> This included public school teacher Nicanor Gonzales Jr., who was [[Political detainees under the Marcos dictatorship|detained]] for seven months and heavily tortured, leaving an abnormal growth on his skull.<ref name="BantayogProfileNicanorGonzalesJr">{{Cite web |date=June 10, 2023 |title=Martyrs & Heroes: Nicanor Gonzales |url=https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/nicanor-gonzales-jr/ |access-date=December 19, 2023 |website=Bantayog ng mga Bayani |language=en-US}}</ref> He was eventually honored in 2015 by having his name inscribed at the Philippines' [[Bantayog ng mga Bayani]], which honors the martyrs and heroes who resisted the authoritarian regime.<ref name="JaymeeGamil2015Honoring">{{Cite news |last=Gamil |first=Jaymee T. |date=2015-12-02 |title=15 new martyrs honored in Bantayog ng mga Bayani |language=en |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/744067/15-new-martyrs-honored-in-bantayog-ng-mga-bayani |access-date=2023-12-22}}</ref>

Cagayan de Oro did not take these [[human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship]] lightly, and the city came to have a reputation as one of the centers of political opposition in the Philippines.<ref name="CityWebsiteHistoricalProfile">{{Cite web |title=Historical Background |url=http://cagayandeoro.gov.ph/about-cdo/historical-background/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309235539/http://cagayandeoro.gov.ph/about-cdo/historical-background/ |archive-date=March 9, 2014 |access-date=September 21, 2020 |website=cagayandeoro.gov.ph |publisher=City Government of Cagayan De Oro}}</ref>

Cagayan de Oro was declared a highly urbanized city by the Ministry of Local Government on November 22, 1983. In 1986, the city participated in the [[People Power Revolution]] through rallies in the streets of the city. When the revolution succeeded and ousted Marcos from power in Manila, the city was among those who supported the installation of [[Corazon Aquino]] as president.

===Recent history===
On 4 October 1990, the city was seized by a rebel army led by dissident [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement|RAM]] officer Alexander Noble and civilian supporters of the [[Mindanao Independence Movement]] led by [[Reuben Canoy]], who marched across the city and took over the regional military garrison at [[Camp Edilberto Evangelista]] as part of an [[1990 Mindanao revolt|attempted coup]] against President Corazon Aquino. However, Noble's forces failed to gain further support and were isolated by government forces, culminating in Noble's surrender and Canoy's arrest on 6 October.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aquino orders court martial of rebel leader|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/10/06/Aquino-orders-court-martial-of-rebel-leader/8528655185600/|access-date=27 June 2023|publisher=UPI|date=6 October 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Former assemblyman and mayor Reuben Canoy dies at 93|url=https://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2022/07/former-assemblyman-and-mayor-reuben-canoy-dies-at-93/|access-date=27 June 2023|publisher=MindaNews|date=6 July 2022}}</ref>

In 1992, the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] recognized the archaeological value of [[Huluga Caves|Huluga]] when it gave the Open Site and caves separate accession numbers. In 1999, however, mayor Vicente Y. Emano conceived the plan to bulldoze Huluga to give way to a road-and-bridge project. The project was stopped in 2001, but was eventually continued in 2002. The construction destroyed at least 60% of the archaeological site's open area, where the majority of artifacts can be found. Protests against the heritage destruction was made by cultural experts, but nothing happened with their plea.

In 2003, the Heritage Conservation Advocates (HCA) went to the open area of Huluga for a scientific surface investigation and managed to find earthenware, Chinese pottery sherds, obsidian flakes, animal bones, an ancient Spanish coin, and a whale harpoon similar to those being used in Lomblen Island, Indonesia. The newly discovered artifacts proved that there are still many artifacts that can be found in the area. This caused the HCA to file a case against Emano and the contractor, UKC Builders, before the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). However, the construction continued and was inaugurated in September 2003 by Emano.

A day later, president [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] made a speech in [[UNESCO]] about her administration's gains in cultural conservation. In January 2004, the city council enacted an ordinance that authorized Emano to sign a contract with the Archaeological Studies Program (ASP) of the University of the Philippines to do salvage archaeology in Huluga and vicinities. The program did not make cooperative linkages with existing archeological programs from Xavier University. The ASP declared that the site was an ancient camp, not a settlement, due to their findings in the destroyed archaeological site. The report did not consider the findings of Xavier University. The issue later climbed into the Philippine Senate, where [[Loren Legarda]] issued a resolution for investigation of the matter, but the investigation was never approved by the other members of the Senate. The artifacts found in the [[Huluga Caves]] and its destroyed open site from 1992 to 2003 are housed in Xavier University, Capitol University, and the University of the Philippines.{{cn|date=March 2024}}

===Notable calamities===
[[File:Typhoon Sendong aftermath.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of Tropical Storm Sendong (Washi)]]
On the evening of December 16–17, 2011, [[Tropical Storm Washi|Tropical Storm Sendong]] (international name ''Washi'') caused widespread [[flash flood]]ing in Northern Mindanao. In Cagayan de Oro, hundreds living near the banks of the Cagayan de Oro River were killed, with hundreds still missing.

Officials said that despite government warning, some people did not evacuate. Five people were killed in a landslide, while others died in the flash floods which occurred overnight, following 10&nbsp;hours of [[rain]], compounded by overflowing rivers and tributaries. Most of the victims had been sleeping.

In some areas, up to 20&nbsp;centimeters of rain fell in 24&nbsp;hours. More than 2,000 were rescued, according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and at least 20,000 people were staying in 10 evacuation centers in Cagayan de Oro. Officials were also investigating reports that an entire [[village]] was swept away.<ref name="CNN 1">{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/18/world/asia/philippines-storm/index.html | title=Storm death toll tops 650 in Philippines; hundreds missing | author=[[Maria Ressa|Ressa, Maria]]| publisher=[[CNN]] | work=Asia | date=December 19, 2011 | access-date=September 13, 2012 }}</ref> The confirmed death toll from the disaster is 1,268.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Death toll from Typhoon Bopha tops 1,000 in the Philippines - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/16/world/asia/philippines-typhoon/index.html|website = CNN|date = December 16, 2012|access-date = August 6, 2015}}</ref>

On December 21, 2017, [[Typhoon Tembin (2017)|Typhoon Vinta]] (international name ''Tembin'') impacted most of Mindanao. It made its landfall in the [[Davao Region]]. Three bridges were closed due to rising water levels in Cagayan de Oro, where 1,719 individuals were forced to evacuate. Roughly 30,000 people were either stranded in ports or stayed in evacuation centers while 22,000 people moved to higher grounds due to heavy flooding.

==Geography==
[[File:Cagayan De Oro Aftermath Typhoon Washi.jpg|thumb|NASA—satellite image captured of Macajalar Bay and the [[Metro Cagayan de Oro|metropolitan area]].]]

In 2014, the 1990 seal was readopted contrary to recommendations of local historians to readopt the 1950 seal which was recognized as the seal of the city by [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines|NHCP]].

==Culture and arts==

There are several notable events in the city. Each barangay or [[barrio]] has its own feast locally known as ''Fiesta'' (or [[festivals]]) honoring their patron saints after achieving recognition in their own rights.

[[File:Higalaay Kagayan Festival 2014.jpg|thumb|During the [[Higalaay Festival|Higalaay]] (Kagay-an Festival) 2014]]

The [[Higalaay Festival]] (formerly the Kagay-an Festival, then the Higalaay Kagay-an Festival) is a week-long celebration in honor of Cagayan de Oro's patron saint [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] held every August.

Highlights of the Higalaay Festival are the Kahimunan Trade Fair, which features the native products of the city and province, particularly agricultural, Miss Cagayan de Oro, Folkloric Street Dancing Competition featuring colorful attires and cultural dances of the Higaonon tribes, Higalas Parade of Cagayan de Oro Icons and Floats, Halad sa Lambagohan, PE Rhythmic Dance Competition, Kalo Festival and [[Kumbira]], a culinary show and exhibit that started in 1996 by Kagay-anons hoteliers and restaurants. It has since evolved over the years and now hosts a culinary competition among students and professionals from all over Mindanao.<ref name="CDO Guide 1">{{cite web | url=http://cdoguide.com/sights/events/kagayan-festival.html | title=Kagay-an Festival | publisher=CDO Guide: Your Online Guide to Cagayan de Oro | access-date=September 13, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022125717/http://cdoguide.com/sights/events/kagayan-festival.html | archive-date=October 22, 2012  }}</ref> The competition is divided into students and professionals where hotel and restaurant management schools and professional chefs compete against each other in their respective categories. There are also cultural shows, competitions and celebrity concerts. In more recent years, some of these competitions have been replaced with new ones, such as the Folkloric Street Dancing Competition, which was replaced by the Cagayan de Oro Carnival Parade in 2014.<ref name="About Cagayan de Oro">{{cite web | url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/cagayan-de-oro-carnival-parade-2015-clash-of-festive-acts-and-carnival-queens/ | title=Cagayan de Oro Carnival Parade | date=August 25, 2015 | publisher=ACadeO:What To Do in Cagayan de Oro | access-date= November 3, 2015}}</ref>

The Pasko de Oro festival of December 2023 after the August [[Higalaay Festival]] is hosted at the 2.5-kilometer two-lane Rio de Oro Boulevard along the [[Cagayan River (Mindanao)|Cagayan de Oro River]], which was declared  a major [[tourist attraction]]. The festival features the dragon boat racing, street dancing competition, fluvial religious procession, agro fair, photo contest, cowboy rodeo festival and trade fair.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Echeminada|first1= Perseus|title=Rio de Oro Boulevard undergoes majestic transformation|url= https://tribune.net.ph/2023/12/24/rio-de-oro-boulevard-undergoes-majestic-transformation|accessdate=August 5, 2024 |publisher= [[Daily Tribune (Philippines)]]|date=December 25, 2023}}</ref>

The annual religious tradition of the Feast of the Black Nazarene in Cagayan de Oro City is held every January 9 by having a procession called "Traslacion" in which hundreds of thousands of devotees participate. Cagayan de Oro is one of only three sites in the country to have this 'Traslacion'.

"Himugso", which means ''birth,'' is a week-long celebration of Cagayan de Oro's Charter Day and Philippine Independence Day. Cagayan de Oro's cityhood was established on June 15, 1950. Independence Day is the national commemoration of the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain on June 12, 1898.
