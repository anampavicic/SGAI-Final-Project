Founded in 1822, it is located on [[Cape Mesurado]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] and as of the 2022 census had 1,761,032 residents, home to 33.5% of Liberia’s total population.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/liberia/ | title=Liberia: Counties, Major Cities, Towns & Urban Areas - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information }}</ref> Its largely urbanized metro area, including [[Montserrado County|Montserrado]] and [[Margibi County|Margibi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]], was home to 2,225,911 inhabitants as of the 2022 census. 

As the nation's [[primate city]], Monrovia is the country's economic, financial and cultural center; its economy is primarily centered on its harbor and its role as the seat of Liberian government. The city's economy is largely based on its position as chief [[List of ports and harbours of the Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic port]] of Liberia, with the [[Freeport of Monrovia]] based in the city being the largest and main port in the country.

The land in which the city resides was traditionally the land of the [[Vai people|Vai People]], a West African ethnic group. It was founded on April 5, 1822, by members of the [[American Colonization Society|American Colonization Society (ACS)]] as an organization to return former slaves born in the United States to Africa. 

==Etymology==
Monrovia is named in honor of [[U.S. President]] [[James Monroe]], a prominent supporter of the colonization of Liberia and the ACS. Along with [[Washington, D.C.]], it is one of two world [[Capital city|capitals]] to be named after a U.S. President. The original name of Monrovia was Christopolis before being changed to its current name in 1824, only two years after the city's founding.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Monrovia}}
[[File:Monrovia01.jpg|thumb|Monrovia in the 19th century.]]

Before 1816, the area around [[Cape Mesurado]] and the mouth of the [[Mesurado River]] was called Ducor. It had long been established as a crossroads and a place of trade inhabited by fishing, trading and farming communities of various ethnicities, including the [[Dewoin language|Dey]], [[Kru people|Kru]], Bassa, Gola, and Vai. The French cartographer and enslaver [[Chevalier des Marchais]] visited Ducor and the Cape in 1723, conducted business there and later published a map of the area.

In 1816, with the aim of establishing a self-sufficient colony for emancipated American slaves, something that had already been accomplished in [[Freetown]], the first group of [[African American]] settlers arrived in West Africa from the United States under the auspices of the [[American Colonization Society]] and with the support of the U.S. government.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/446/ |title = Map of Liberia, West Africa |work = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1830 |access-date = 2013-06-02 }}</ref> They landed on [[Sherbro Island]], part of modern-day [[Sierra Leone]].

On January 7, 1822, a ship took these settlers to Dazoe Island (now called Providence Island) at the mouth of the Mesurado River. They subsequently went ashore at [[Cape Mesurado]], and established a settlement they called ''Christopolis''.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 193</ref><ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Monrovia Monrovia], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>
In 1824, the city was renamed ''Monrovia'' after [[James Monroe]], president of the United States at the time. Monroe was a prominent supporter of developing the city as a place to relocate formerly enslaved Black people from the [[United States|United States of America]] and [[Caribbean islands]], an idea put forth as an alternative to [[abolitionism in the United States|abolishing the institution of slavery in America]].

In 1845 there was a constitutional convention in Monrovia, at this convention a document was drafted that would be adopted two years later as the constitution of the newly independent and sovereign [[Republic of Liberia]].<ref>{{citation | first1 = Robin | last1 = Dunn-Marcos | first2 = Konia T. | last2 = Kollehlon | first3 = Bernard | last3 = Ngovo | first4 = Emily | last4 = Russ | date = April 2005 | editor-first = Donald A. | editor-last = Ranard | title = Liberians: An introduction to their history and culture | location = Washington, D.C. | publisher = Center for Applied Linguistics | url = http://www.trincoll.edu/~jmartha/liberians%20history%20and%20culture.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724191221/http://www.trincoll.edu/~jmartha/liberians%20history%20and%20culture.pdf | archive-date=2006-07-24 }}</ref>

At the beginning of the 20th century 2,500 of Monrovia’s 4,000 residents were [[Americo-Liberian]]. At that time Monrovia consisted of two sectors: Monrovia proper and Krutown. The city's Americo-Liberian population resided in the former sector. Because of American settlers' influence the architectural style of its buildings was reminiscent of that of the [[southern United States]]. Krutown was inhabited mainly by ethnic [[Kru people|Krus]], but also by [[Bassa (Liberia)|Bassas]], [[Grebo people|Grebos]] and members of other ethnic groups.<ref name="google1">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJfJHjiiDyUC&pg=PA367 |title= Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century African History |access-date=2010-07-04|isbn=9780415234795 |last1=Zeleza |first1=Tiyambe |last2=Eyoh |first2=Dickson | date =2003 | publisher = Routledge }}</ref> By 1926 ethnic groups from Liberia's interior began to migrate outwards toward Monrovia in search of jobs.<ref name="google1"/> By 1937 Monrovia’s population had grown to 10,000. At this time the town had 30 police officers.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=1937-09-13|title=Liberia Celebrates 90 Years of Independence with Champagne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|volume=3|issue=11|pages=87–88|issn=0024-3019}}</ref>
[[File:Carter and Tolbert.png|thumb|left|Visiting US President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Liberian President [[William Tolbert]] wave from their motorcade, 1978.]]
In 1979 the [[Organisation of African Unity]], chaired by the then president of Liberia, [[William Tolbert]], held its conference near Monrovia. During his term, Tolbert improved [[public housing]] in Monrovia and slashed [[tuition fees]] at the [[University of Liberia]] in half. In 1980 a military coup led by [[Samuel Doe]] overthrew the Tolbert government and executed many of its members. Tolbert, and others who were killed in the coup, were buried in a mass grave in Palm Grove Cemetery.

The [[First Liberian Civil War]] (1989 to 1997) and [[Second Liberian Civil War]] (1999 to 2003) severely damaged the infrastructure of the city. Much of the damage occurred during the [[siege of Monrovia]]. Major battles included clashes between Samuel Doe's government forces and [[Prince Johnson]]'s forces in 1990 and the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]]'s assault on the city in 1992. During these wars young children and youth, deprived of resources and schooling, were forced to involve themselves in the fighting. Afterwards, many of them were left homeless.

In 2002 [[Leymah Gbowee]] organized the [[Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace]], a group consisting of local Monrovian women, who gathered in a fish market to pray and sing.<ref>[http://www.odemagazine.com/blogs/readers_blog/9001/leymah_gbowee_peace_warrior_for_liberia 2009 Peace warrior for Liberia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227090728/http://www.odemagazine.com/blogs/readers_blog/9001/leymah_gbowee_peace_warrior_for_liberia |date=2009-12-27 }}</ref> This movement helped to end the war the following year and to bring about the election of [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] as president of Liberia, which made it the first African nation to have a [[female president]].<ref>{{cite web | title=African women look within for change | website=CNN.com | date=2010-09-23 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/10/30/africa.women/ | access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>

In 2014 the city was affected by the [[2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = The terrifying mathematics of Ebola
|work = Channel 4|access-date=2014-09-11|date = 2014-09-11|url = http://blogs.channel4.com/tom-clarke-on-science/terrifying-mathematics-ebola/1329}}</ref> The [[Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia]] was declared to be over on 3 September 2015.

==Geography==
[[File:Monrovia Bay.jpg|thumb|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from Monrovia.]]

Monrovia lies along the Cape Mesurado peninsula, between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Mesurado River]], whose mouth forms a large natural harbor. The [[Saint Paul River]] lies directly north of the city and forms the northern boundary of [[Bushrod Island]], which is reached by crossing the "New Bridge" from downtown Monrovia. Monrovia is located in [[Montserrado County]] and is Liberia's largest city as its administrative, commercial and financial center.<ref name=housing>{{cite web |url=http://www.iut.nu/Facts%20and%20figures/Africa/Liberia_HousingSectorProfile.pdf |title=Liberia Housing Profile |publisher=[[United Nations Human Settlements Programme]] |pages=14–15, 23 |date=2014 |access-date=2017-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017042216/http://www.iut.nu/Facts%20and%20figures/Africa/Liberia_HousingSectorProfile.pdf |archive-date=2017-10-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Monrovia's climate is classified as a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'').<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web|title=Climate: Monrovia - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/506/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|access-date=2014-01-05}}</ref> It is the wettest capital city in the world, with annual rainfall averaging {{convert|182|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/09/liberia%E2%80%99s-capital The rain in Monrovia]</ref> It has a [[wet season]] and a [[dry season]] but gets precipitation even during the dry season. Temperatures are fairly constant throughout the year, averaging around {{convert|79.5|F}}. The only slight differences are the high temperatures, as they are around {{convert|81|F}} in the winter and near {{convert|90|F}} in the summer, with lows being around 22–24 year-round.

[[File:Monrovia, Liberia Population Density and Low Elevation Coastal Zones (5457306759).jpg|thumb|300px|Population density and low elevation coastal zones. Monrovia is especially vulnerable to [[sea level rise]].]]
Monrovia comprises several districts spread across the Mesurado peninsula; the greater metropolitan area encircles the mouth of the marshy Mesurado River. The historic downtown area, centered on Broad Street, is at the very end of the peninsula; the major market district, Waterside, immediately to its north, faces the city's large natural harbor.

Northwest of Waterside is the large, low-income [[West Point, Liberia|West Point]] community. To the west and southwest of the downtown area is Mamba Point, traditionally the city's principal diplomatic quarter and home to the embassies of the United States and United Kingdom, as well as the European Union delegation. South of the city center is Capitol Hill, where the major institutions of the national government, including the [[Temple of Justice (Liberia)|Temple of Justice]] and the Executive Mansion, are located.

Further east along the peninsula is the [[Sinkor]] section of Monrovia. Originally a suburban residential district, today Sinkor is the bustling midtown section of the city. It includes many diplomatic missions, major hotels, businesses, and residential neighborhoods, including informal communities such as Plumkor, Jorkpentown, Lakpazee and Fiamah.
Sinkor is also home to the city's secondary airport, [[Spriggs Payne Airport|Spriggs Payne]], and the area immediately next to the airport, called Airfield, is a major nightlife district for the whole city. East of the Airfield is the Old Road section of Sinkor, which is predominantly residential, and includes informal settlements such as [[Chugbor]] and [[Gaye Town]].

At the southeastern base of the peninsula is the independent township of Congo Town, and to its east is the large suburb of [[Paynesville, Liberia|Paynesville]]. Other suburbs, such as [[Chocolate City, Liberia|Chocolate City]], [[Gardnersville]], [[Barnesville, Liberia|Barnesville]], [[Kaba Town]], [[Dandawailo]], and [[New Georgia, Liberia|New Georgia]] lie to the north, across the river. On [[Bushrod Island]], north of Monrovia, are the neighborhoods of [[Clara Town]], [[Logan Town]] and [[New Kru Town]]. To the far east are the suburbs of [[Stockton Creek Bridge]], [[Caldwell, Liberia|Caldwell]], [[Louisiana, Liberia|Louisiana]], and [[Cassava Hill]].

==Economy==

[[File:Market stall @ Monrovia, Liberia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Market stall in central Monrovia]]

Monrovia's economy is dominated by its harbor - the [[Freeport of Monrovia]] - and as the location of Liberia's government offices. Monrovia's harbor was significantly expanded by U.S. forces during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the main exports include [[latex]] and [[iron ore]].

Materials are also manufactured on-site, such as [[cement]], refined [[petroleum]], food products, [[brick]] and [[tile]], furniture, and [[Chemical industry|chemicals]]. Located on [[Bushrod Island]] between the mouths of the [[Mesurado River|Mesurado]] and [[Saint Paul River|Saint Paul]] rivers, the harbor also has facilities for storing and repairing vessels.

==Transport==

Monrovia is connected with the rest of the country via a network of roads and railways. Monrovia is listed as the home port by between ten and fifteen percent of the world's merchant shipping, registered in Liberia under [[Flag of Convenience]] arrangements. Both private taxis and minibuses run in the city, and are supplemented by larger buses run by the [[Monrovia Transit Authority]].

In recent years (2005–present) the roads on many streets in Monrovia have been rebuilt by the World Bank and the Liberian Government. Private and public infrastructures are being built or renovated as reconstruction takes place.

==Administration and government==
[[File:Liberian Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|Liberian Capitol Building.]]
Monrovia is situated in the [[Districts of Liberia|district]] of [[Greater Monrovia District|Greater Monrovia]] in [[Montserrado County]]. Instead of being divided into [[Clans of Liberia|clans]] like other districts of Liberia, Greater Monrovia is divided into 16 "zones". Like clans, these zones are [[Communities of the Greater Monrovia District|subdivided into 161 communities]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Greater Monrovia, Liberia - Administrative Boundaries Overview|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/LBR_BM_Monrovia_Communities_A3.pdf |website=ReliefWeb |publisher=Liberia Institute of Statistics & Geo-Information Services|access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="CitiesAlliance">{{cite web|title=THE TRANSFORMATIVE ROLE OF CITY-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST EBOLA AND BEY OND IN GREATER MONRO VIA, LIBERIA|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/CA_Liberia_report_WEB.pdf|website=Cities Alliances|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-date=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118081948/http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/CA_Liberia_report_WEB.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Greater Monrovia does not have an organized district administration like other districts, with all lower-level local authorities being directly supervised by the Montserrado County Superintendent.<ref name="Development">{{cite web|title=Montserrado County Development Agenda, 2008-2012|url=http://www.emansion.gov.lr/doc/MontserradoCDA.pdf|website=emansion.gov.lr/|publisher=Republic of Liberia|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-date=2 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102070138/https://www.emansion.gov.lr/doc/MontserradoCDA.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Municipally, Greater Monrovia District is subdivided into two city corporations and ten other local authorities (nine townships and one borough).<ref name="CitiesAlliance"/><ref>{{cite web|title=THE LIBERIA COUNTRY PROGRAMME|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/12.%20Liberia%20Country%20Programme_ENG.pdf|website=Cities Alliance|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614060659/http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/12.%20Liberia%20Country%20Programme_ENG.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Established by law in 1973<ref>{{cite web |url=http://monroviacity.blogspot.com/2007/09/mcc-launches-website-more-to-come-for.html |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CITY OF MONROVIA - By: Madam Ophelia Hoff Saytumah City Mayor of Monrovia |website=Monrovia City Corporation |date=2007-09-29 |access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> and operational since 1976,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tlcafrica.com/ad_city_hall_monrovia_day_ad_2-2011.htm |title=ORDINANCE NO. 4 |website=TLC Africa |access-date=2017-10-16 |archive-date=2017-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016232057/http://www.tlcafrica.com/ad_city_hall_monrovia_day_ad_2-2011.htm |url-status=usurped }}</ref> the Monrovia City Corporation (MCC) is responsible for the city's administration.

==Culture and media==
[[File:Monrovia, Liberia - panoramio (53).jpg|thumb|Broad Street, Monrovia at night]]
Cultural attractions in Monrovia include the [[Liberian National Museum]], the [[Masonic Order of Liberia|Masonic Temple]], the Waterside Market, and several beaches. The city also houses [[Antoinette Tubman Stadium]] and the [[Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex]], with [[stadium seating|seats]] for 22,000.<ref name=stadiums>{{cite web|title=World of Stadiums - - Liberia |url=https://worldofstadiums.com/africa/liberia/|accessdate=29 October 2024}}</ref>

The newspaper industry in Monrovia dates back to the 1820s, with the founding of the ''[[Liberia Herald]]'', one of the first newspapers to be published in Africa. Today, numerous [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-style newspapers are printed daily or bi-weekly, most are 20 pages or less. The ''[[Daily Talk]]'' is a compilation of news and Bible quotations written daily on a roadside blackboard in the [[Sinkor]] section of Monrovia.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Monrovia also has radio and TV stations. Radio is the dominant source of news, because problems with the [[Grid (electricity)|electric grid]] make watching television more difficult. [[UNMIL]] Radio has been broadcasting since October 1, 2003, and is the only radio station in Liberia that is on the air 24 hours a day. It reaches an estimated {{frac|2|3}} of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unmil.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110095400/http://www.unmil.org/content.asp?ccat=radio|url-status=dead|title=UNMIL – Misión de las Naciones Unidas en Liberia|archive-date=January 10, 2007|website=www.unmil.org}}</ref> The state-owned [[Liberia Broadcasting System]] broadcasts nationwide from its headquarters in Monrovia.<ref>[http://www.emansion.gov.lr/press.php?news_id=950 Liberia Broadcasting System (LBS) Goes Nation-Wide.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722152013/http://www.emansion.gov.lr/press.php?news_id=950 |date=2011-07-22 }} 19 November 2008.

In 2013, the problem of uncollected rubbish in the [[Paynesville, Liberia|Paynesville]] area of Monrovia became so acute that traders and residents burnt "the huge garbage piles that seemed on the verge of cutting off the main road" out of Monrovia to [[Kakata]].<ref name="liberianobserver.com"/>

Flooding brings additional environmental problems to residents: flood water picks up the waste that has been deposited in swamps at the edge of residential areas, and spreads it around.<ref name="liberianobserver.com"/>

In 2009, only one-third of Monrovia's 1.5 million people had access to clean toilets.<ref name="LIBERIA: Disease rife"/> Those without their own toilets defecate in the narrow alleyways between their houses, or on the beach, or into plastic bags that they dump onto nearby piles of rubbish or into the sea.<ref name="LIBERIA: Disease rife">[http://www.irinnews.org/report/87110/liberia-disease-rife-as-more-people-squeeze-into-fewer-toilets "LIBERIA: Disease rife as more people squeeze into fewer toilets"], [[The New Humanitarian|IRIN News]], 19 November 2009.</ref>

Congested housing, a lack of any requirement that landlords provide working toilets, and virtually no urban planning "have combined to create lethal sanitation conditions in the capital".<ref name="LIBERIA: No relief">[http://www.irinnews.org/report/81536/liberia-no-relief-as-most-monrovians-go-without-toilets "LIBERIA: No relief as most Monrovians go without toilets"], [[The New Humanitarian|IRIN News]], 19 November 2008.</ref>
