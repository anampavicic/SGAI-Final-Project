It is located {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Baltic Sea]] coast, and intersected by the river [[Dzierżęcinka]]. Koszalin is also a county-status city and capital of [[Koszalin County]] of [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]].

== History ==
Human settlement in Koszalin dates back to prehistoric times. Various traces of human settlement of the [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnelbeaker]], [[Globular Amphora culture|Globular Amphora]] and [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] cultures and from [[ancient Roman]] times and [[Early Middle Ages]] were discovered during [[archaeological excavation]]s.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Pdsoki fragment murów miejskich przy ul Marii Ludwiki w Koszalinie 01.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval city walls]]
The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under [[Mieszko I]] around 967.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Labuda|first=Gerard|year=1993|title=Chrystianizacja Pomorza (X–XIII stulecie)|magazine=Studia Gdańskie|language=pl|location=Gdańsk-Oliwa|volume=IX|page=47}}</ref> According to the Medieval [[Wielkopolska Chronicle|Chronicle of Greater Poland]] (''Kronika Wielkopolska'') Koszalin was one of the [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranian]] cities captured and subjugated by Duke [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] of Poland in 1107 (other towns included [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Kamień Pomorski|Kamień]] and [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.koszalin.pl/pl/page/historia-koszalina|title=Historia Koszalina, Serwis Urzędu Miejskiego w Koszalinie|access-date=June 8, 2019}}</ref> Afterwards, in the 12th century the area became part of the [[House of Griffin|Griffin]]-ruled [[Duchy of Pomerania]], a vassal state of [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]], which separated from Poland after the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, and became a vassal of [[Denmark]] in 1185 and a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1227.

In 1214, [[Bogislaw II, Duke of Pomerania|Bogislaw II]], [[Dukes of Pomerania|Duke of Pomerania]], made a donation of a village known as Koszalice/Cossalitz by Chełmska Hill in Kołobrzeg Land to the [[Premonstratensian|Norbertine]] monastery in Białoboki near [[Trzebiatów]]. New, mostly [[German people|German]], settlers from outside of Pomerania were invited to settle the territory. In 1248, the eastern part of Kołobrzeg Land, including the village, was transferred by Duke [[Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania|Barnim I]] to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kammin]].<ref name=Koebler>Gerhard Köbler, ''Historisches Lexikon der Deutschen Länder: die deutschen Territorien vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart'', 7th edition, C.H. Beck, 2007, p. 113, {{ISBN|3-406-54986-1}}</ref>

On 23 May 1266, Kammin bishop [[Hermann von Gleichen]] granted a charter to the village, granting it [[Lübeck law]], local government, autonomy and multiple privileges to attract German settlers from the west.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Higounet|title=Die deutsche Ostsiedlung im Mittelalter|pages=149|language=de}}</ref> When in 1276 the bishops became the sovereign in neighboring [[Kołobrzeg]], they moved their residence there, while the administration of the diocese was done from Koszalin.<ref name=Koebler/> In 1278 a [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery was established, which took care of the local parish church and St. Mary chapel on Chełmska Hill.<ref name=MUZ/>

The city obtained direct access to the [[Baltic Sea]] when it gained the village of Jamno (1331), parts of [[Jamno (lake)|Lake Jamno]], a spit between the lake and the sea and the castle of [[Unieście]] in 1353. Thence, it participated in the Baltic Sea trade as a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] (from 1386),<ref name=MUZ/> which led to several conflicts with the competing seaports of at Kołobrzeg and [[Darłowo]]. From 1356 until 1417/1422, the city was part of the Duchy of [[Pomerania-Wolgast]]. In 1446 Koszalin fought a victorious battle against the nearby rival city of [[Kołobrzeg]].<ref name=MUZ>{{cite web|url=http://muzeum.koszalin.pl/?q=node/1699|title=Kalendarium 750 lat Koszalina, Muzeum w Koszalinie|access-date=June 9, 2019|language=pl}}</ref> In 1475 a conflict between the city of Koszalin and the Pomeranian duke [[Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania|Bogislaw X]] broke out, resulting in the kidnapping and temporary imprisonment of the duke in Koszalin.<ref name=MUZ/>

}}As a result of [[Ostsiedlung|German colonization]], the town became mostly German-speaking, putting indigenous Slavic speakers at disadvantage.<ref name=MUZ/> In 1516 local Germans enforced a ban on buying goods from Slavic speakers.<ref>Hieronim Kroczyński, ''Kołobrzeg zarys dziejów'', Wyd. Poznańskie, Poznań, 1979, p. 27 (in Polish)</ref> It was also forbidden to accept native Slavs to craft guilds, which indicates ethnic discrimination.<ref name=MUZ/>

In 1531 riots took place between supporters and opponents of the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name=MUZ/> In 1534 the city became mostly [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] under the influence of [[Johannes Bugenhagen]]. In 1568, [[John Frederick, Duke of Pomerania]] and [[Bishopric of Cammin|bishop of Cammin]], started constructing a residence, finished by his successor [[Casimir VI, Duke of Pomerania|Casimir VI of Pomerania]] in 1582.<ref name=MUZ/> After the 1637 death of the last Pomeranian duke, [[Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania|Bogislaw XIV]], the city passed to his cousin, Bishop [[Ernst Bogislaw von Croÿ]] of Kammin. Occupied by [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] troops during the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1637, some of the city's inhabitants sought refuge in nearby Poland.<ref name=MUZ/> The city was granted to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] after the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] (1648) and the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)]], and with all of [[Farther Pomerania]] became part of the [[Province of Pomerania (1653-1815)|Brandenburgian Pomerania]].

Now renamed Cöslin as part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the city was heavily damaged by a fire in 1718, but was rebuilt in the following years. In 1764 on the Chełmska Hill, now located within the city limits, a Pole Jan Gelczewski founded a paper mill that supplied numerous city offices.<ref name=MUZ/> The city was occupied by [[First French Empire|French]] troops in 1807 after the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. Following the [[Napoleonic wars]], it became the capital of [[Fürstenthum (district)|Fürstenthum District]] ([[Districts of Prussia|county]]) and [[Köslin (region)|Regierungsbezirk Cöslin]] ([[Regierungsbezirk|government region]]) within the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]]. The Fürstenthum District was dissolved on 1 September 1872 and replaced with the [[Köslin (district)|Cöslin District]] on December 13. Between 1829 and 1845, a road connecting Cöslin (Koszalin) with [[Szczecin|Stettin (Szczecin)]] and [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]] was built.<ref name=MUZ/> Part of this road, from Cöslin (Koszalin) to the nearby town of [[Sianów]], was built in 1833 by around one hundred former [[November Uprising|Polish insurgents]].<ref name=MUZ/> In 1869, the Saint Joseph church was built by local [[Polish people|Poles]].

The town became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]]. The railroad from Stettin through Cöslin and [[Słupsk|Stolp (Słupsk)]] to Danzig was constructed from 1858 to 1878. A military cadet school created by [[Frederick the Great]] in 1776 was moved from [[Chełmno|Kulm (Chełmno)]] to the city in 1890. The ''Kösliner Zeitung'' was as a local newspaper published in Köslin.

=== After World War II ===
On 4 March 1945, the city was captured by the [[Red Army]]. Under the border changes forced by the [[Soviet Union]] in the post-war [[Potsdam Agreement]], Koszalin became part of Poland as part of the so-called [[Recovered Territories]]. The city's German population that had not yet fled was [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expelled]] to the remainder of post-war Germany in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. The city was resettled by Poles and [[Kashubians]], many of whom had been expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Polish territory annexed by the Soviets]].<ref>W. Seidel: Das Land und Volk der Kassuben. In: Preußische Provinzialblätter N.F. 2 (1852), p. 104.</ref>

As early as March 1945 a Polish police unit was established, consisting of former [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] and [[prisoners of war]], however, the Soviets, still present in the city, plundered local industrial factories in April.<ref name=KAL>{{cite web|url=http://muzeum.koszalin.pl/?q=node/529|title=Kalendarium Koszalina z lat 1945-1950, Muzeum w Koszalinie|access-date=June 8, 2019|language=pl}}</ref> From May 1945, life in the destroyed city was being organized, the first post-war schools, shops and service premises were established.<ref name=KAL/> In 1946, the first public library was opened, whose director was later Maria Pilecka, the sister of Polish national hero [[Witold Pilecki]].<ref>Laskowski, p. 114</ref> In March 1946, the [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1946)|anti-communist]] [[Home Army 5th Wilno Brigade]] was active in Koszalin.<ref name=KAL/> In July 1947, the last units of the [[Soviet Army]] left Koszalin, and from that time only Polish troops were stationed in the city.<ref name=KAL/> In 1953 a local radio station was founded in Koszalin.<ref name=MUZ/>
[[File:Koszalin plac Zwyciestwa.jpg|thumb|The Victory Square with the statue of [[Józef Piłsudski]] and the former [[Koszalin Voivodeship (disambiguation)|Koszalin Voivodeship]] Office in the background]]

Initially, Koszalin was the first post-war regional capital of Polish Western Pomerania, before the administration finally moved to [[Szczecin]] in February 1946, after which the region was named the [[Szczecin Voivodeship (1946–1975)|Szczecin Voivodeship]].<ref name=MUZ/> In 1950 this voivodeship was divided into a truncated [[Szczecin Voivodeship (1946–1975)|Szczecin Voivodeship]] and [[Koszalin Voivodeship (1950–1975)|Koszalin Voivodeship]]. In years 1950-75 Koszalin was the capital of the enlarged [[Koszalin Voivodeship (1950–1975)|Koszalin Voivodeship]] sometimes called [[Middle Pomerania]] due to becoming the fastest growing city in Poland. In years 1975-98 it was the capital of the smaller [[Koszalin Voivodeship (1975–1998)|Koszalin Voivodeship]]. As a result of the Local Government Reorganization Act (1998) Koszalin became part of the [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]] (effective 1 January 1999) regardless of an earlier proposal for a new Middle Pomeranian Voivodeship covering approximately the area of former Koszalin Voivodeship (1950–75).

In 1991, Koszalin was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name=LL>Laskowski, p. 7</ref> On the fifth anniversary of his visit, his monument was unveiled in the city center.<ref name=LL/>

== Landmarks ==
The city borders on Chełmska Hill ({{langx|pl|Góra Chełmska}}), a site of [[pagan]] worship in prehistory, and upon which is now built the tower "sanctuary of the covenant", which was consecrated by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1991, and is currently a pilgrimage site. Also an observation tower is located on the hill. At the entrance to the sanctuary there is a monument dedicated to the Polish [[November Uprising|November insurgents]] of 1831, who, imprisoned by Prussian authorities, built a road connecting Koszalin with nearby [[Sianów]].<ref>Laskowski, p. 46-47</ref>

Koszalin's most distinctive landmark is the [[Gothic architecture in Poland|Gothic]] St. Mary's Cathedral, dating from the early 14th century. Positioned in front of the cathedral is a monument commemorating John Paul II's visit to the city.

Other city landmarks include the Park of the Dukes of Pomerania (''Park Książąt Pomorskich''), the Koszalin Museum, the main post office, the 16th-century Wedding Palace and the Culture Centre 105 (''[[:pl:Centrum Kultury 105 w Koszalinie|Centrum Kultury 105]]'').

The city also has monuments dedicated to Polish national heroes: [[Józef Piłsudski]], [[Władysław Anders]], [[Kazimierz Pułaski]], [[Władysław Sikorski]], as well monuments of the 19th-century Polish poets [[Cyprian Norwid]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref>Laskowski, p. 8, 14-17, 44-45, 63</ref>

Being in [[Western Pomerania]] and near the [[Baltic Sea]], it has a much more moderate climate than the other [[List of cities and towns in Poland|large Polish cities]]. The summers are warm and practically never hot as in the south and the winters are often more moderate than the northeast and east, although still cold, yet it is not as mild as [[Western Europe]]. Daily averages below freezing point can be found in January and February, while in the summer they are between 15 and 16&nbsp;°C, relatively cool. The average annual precipitation is 704&nbsp;mm, distributed during the year. Koszalin is one of the sunniest cities in the country.<ref name = noaa>{{cite web
