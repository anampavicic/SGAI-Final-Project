'''Alappuzha''' ({{IPA-ml|aːlɐpːuɻɐ|lang|Alappuzha.ogg}}), formerly known as '''Alleppey''', is a city and [[Municipalities of Kerala|municipality]]<ref name="auto"/> in the [[Alappuzha district]] of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is the district headquarters of the district, and is located about {{convert|130|km|1|abbr=on}} north of the state capital [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. As per the [[2011 Indian census]], Alappuzha has a population of 240,991 people, and a population density of {{convert|3675|/sqkm|abbr=on}}. 

Alappuzha is one of the city in india known as "''[[Venice of the East]]''" 

Alappuzha dates back to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam era]], and was mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as far back as the 1st century AD as "Baraces".<ref>{{Cite web |title=History {{!}} District Alappuzha, Government of Kerala {{!}} India |url=https://alappuzha.nic.in/en/history/#:~:text=History%20says%20Alappuzha%20had%20trade,per%20GO(P)%20No |access-date=2024-08-16 |language=en-US}}</ref> Later in the 16th and 17th centuries, the town flourished as an important hub for trading spices with various European powers including the [[Dutch Malabar|Dutch]] and the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]]. Under the rule of [[Raja Kesavadas]], a port was constructed and canals for transport were laid throughout the city, and the town experienced rapid development. However, by the late 18th century, the region had come under [[British Raj|British rule]] and experienced a decline in its status as a centre for commerce and culture.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Alappuzha |url=https://www.alappuzhaonline.in/city-guide/history-of-alappuzha |website=www.alappuzhaonline.in}}</ref>

Today, Alappuzha is a prominent tourist destination in Kerala. The town is famous for its [[Kerala Backwaters|waterways and backwaters]], and has been described as the "Venice of the East" for the small canals winding through its historic centre. Its also known as the Tarshish land of Kerala<ref>{{cite web|title=History {{!}} District Alappuzha, Government of Kerala {{!}} India|url=https://alappuzha.nic.in/history/|access-date=2020-09-08|language=en-US}}</ref> It plays a role as one of the primary access points for the annual [[Nehru Trophy Boat Race]] during the festival of [[Onam]].<ref>"Nehru Trophy Boat Race.{{cite web|url=http://nehrutrophy.nic.in/new/home.html |title=The History of NTBR :::: |access-date=2011-06-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718024917/http://nehrutrophy.nic.in/new/home.html |archive-date=18 July 2011 |df=dmy }}"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/tourist-centers.htm|title=Tourist Places in India, Best Places to Visit in India|website=Maps of India}}</ref> Alappuzha is also a hub for [[coir]] manufacturing, and has a thriving coir industry.<ref>"coir industry {{cite web|url=http://coirboard.gov.in/aboutcoir.htm |title=:: About Coir :: |access-date=2011-06-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813201137/http://coirboard.gov.in/aboutcoir.htm |archive-date=13 August 2011 |df=dmy }}"</ref>

== Etymology ==
Carved out of the erstwhile [[Kottayam]] and [[Quilon|Kollam]] districts, Alappuzha district was formed on 17 August 1957 and consisted initially of seven [[taluk]]s, namely [[Cherthala]], [[Ambalappuzha]], [[Kuttanad]], [[Chengannur]], [[Karthikappally]] and [[Mavelikkara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alleppeyonline.com/|title=taluks in Alappuzha 1957|publisher=Alleppeyonline.com|access-date=2021-02-14|archive-date=18 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118145124/http://www.alleppeyonline.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The district is bounded on the north by [[Kochi]] and Kanayannur taluks of [[Ernakulam]] district, on the east by [[Vaikom]], Kottayam and [[Changanassery]] taluks of Kottayam district and Thiruvalla, [[Kozhencherry]] and [[Adoor]] taluks of [[Pathanamthitta]] district, on the South by [[Kunnathur (Kerala)|Kunnathur]] and [[Karunagappally]] taluks of [[Kollam district]] and on the west by Laccadive Sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alleppeyonline.com/|title=boundaries|publisher=Alleppeyonline.com|access-date=2021-02-14|archive-date=18 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118145124/http://www.alleppeyonline.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The present Alappuzha district comprises six taluks, namely Cherthala, Ambalappuzha, Kuttanad, Karthikappally, Chengannur and Mavelikkara.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alleppeyonline.com/|title=taluks in Alappuzha|publisher=Alleppeyonline.com|access-date=2021-02-14|archive-date=18 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118145124/http://www.alleppeyonline.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The area of the district is {{cvt|1414|km2}}. Its headquarters is located at Alappuzha.

The name Ᾱlappuzha is a toponym. ‘Ᾱlayam’ means ‘home’ and ‘puzha’, according to Dr. Herman Gundert's dictionary, means ‘watercourse’ or ‘river’.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}} The name refers to the network of waterways and backwaters in Alappuzha and its surrounding areas.

== History ==
{{Moresources|section|date=February 2023}}
[[File:Stone bridge, Alleppey 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Stone Bridge in 1900.]]
[[File:Alleppey canal.jpg|200px|thumb|Walkway in Commercial Canal]]

Kuttanad, the [[breadbasket|rice bowl]] of Kerala, with its paddy fields, small streams and canals with lush green coconut palms, was well known even from the early periods of the [[Sangam age]].<ref name="alappuzha">{{cite web|url=https://www.alappuzha.com/pages/kuttanad|title=Kuttanad|website=www.alappuzha.com}}</ref> 
 
Literary works such as ''[[Unnuneeli Sandesam]]'' give some insight into the ancient period of this district. Archaeological antiquities, such as the stone inscriptions, historical monuments found in the temples, churches, and rock-cut caves, also emphasise the historic importance of Alappuzha District. 

Christianity had a foothold in this district, even from the 1st century AD. The church located at [[Kokkamangalam]] was one of the seven churches founded by [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} one of the twelve disciples of [[Jesus Christ]]. It is generally believed that he landed at [[Maliankara]] in [[Muziris]] Port, presently known as [[Cranganore]] or [[Kodungallur]], in 52 AD and preached Christianity in [[South India]].

The district flourished in religion and culture under the second Chera Empire, during 9th to 12th centuries AD. The literary work `Ascharya Choodamani`, a Sanskrit drama written by [[Sakthibhadran]], a scholar of [[Chengannur]], enables us to know many pertinent facts. Further, the temple on Lord [[Ayyappan]], in Mukkal vattam near Muhamma in Alappuzha District, is called [[Cheerappanchira]], for the Kalari from which Lord Ayyappa learnt his martial arts. A recent album by [[P. Unni Krishnan]] on Lord Ayyappa, titled 'Sabarimalai Va Charanam Solli Va', has songs illustrating the history of this temple and Lord Ayyappa's stay here before he went to conquer the Mahishi Demon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/%E2%80%98Swamiyae%E2%80%A6-Saranam-Aiyappa%E2%80%99/article15616424.ece|title='Swamiyae… Saranam Aiyappa'|first=S.|last=Shivpprasadh|newspaper=The Hindu |date=29 November 2012|via=thehindu.com}}</ref>

Since landing in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] in 1498, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] started playing an influential role in Alappuzha. They began by spreading Catholicism and converting already existing [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christians]] into Catholics. [[Arthunkal#St. Andrew's Basilica, Arthunkal|St Andrew's Basilica]] was built during this period.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arthunkal.bizhat.com/arthunkal_church_history.html | publisher=Arthunkal Church | title=Arthunkal Church history}}</ref> 

In the 17th century, as the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] power declined, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] gained a predominant position in the principalities of this district. They built many factories and warehouses for storing [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[ginger]], relying on several treaties signed between the Dutch and the [[Rajas]] of [[Purakkad]], [[Kayamkulam]] and Karappuram. In course of time they also delved into the political and cultural affairs of the district. At that time Maharaja [[Marthanda Varma]] (1706–1758), who was the 'Maker of modern [[Travancore]]', intervened in the political affairs of those princedoms.

Travancore [[Dewan]] [[Ramayyan Dalawa]] (d. 1756) resided in [[Mavelikkara]] where he had a palace built by Marthanda Varma. After the death of his wife, Ramayyan consorted with a Nair lady from [[Mavelikkara]] of the Edassery family (PGN Unnithan, a member of this family, later became the last Dewan of Travancore in 1947). After his death Ramayyan's descendants left Travancore to settle in [[Pudukkottai]] in Tamil Nadu. His Nair consort was given gifts and presents and special allowances from the Travancore government in recognition of his services to the state while his own descendants were bestowed with the honorific title of Dalawa.

In the 19th century the district saw progress in many spheres. One of the five subordinate courts opened in the state in connection with the reorganization of the judicial system by Colonel [[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] was located at [[Mavelikkara]]. The first post office and first telegraph office in the former Travancore state were established in this district. The first manufacturing factory for the [[coir]] mats was established in 1859. In 1894 the city Improvement Committee was set up.

The district played a role in the freedom struggle of the country. The struggles of [[Punnapra-Vayalar_uprising|Punnapra and Vayalar]] in 1946 arrayed the people against Sir [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer]], who was Dewan of Travancore. This led to Ramaswami Iyer's exit from the political scene of Travancore. A popular Ministry was formed in Travancore on 24 March 1948 after India's independence. Travancore and [[Cochin]] states were integrated on 1 July 1949. This arrangement continued until the formation of Kerala State on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act 1956]]. The district came into existence as a separate administrative unit on 1 August 1957.

=== Raja Kesavadas and Alappuzha ===
[[Raja Kesavadas]], the [[Dewan]] of [[Travancore]] during the reign of [[Dharma Raja|Dharma Raja Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma]] in 18th century was well known for his planning skills and administrative acumen. He was the master mind in developing the Alappuzha town.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alappuzha: A detailed Study for PSC {{!}} PSC Arivukal|url=https://www.pscarivukal.com/2020/02/alappuzha.html|access-date=2021-07-20|website=www.pscarivukal.com}}</ref>

He found Alappuzha as an ideal location and constructing a well planned port city in [[Travancore]]. Alappuzha was most suitable, because of the geographical and oceanic reasons. He constructed two parallel canals for bringing goods to port from backwaters and offered infrastructural facilities to merchants and traders from Surat, Mumbai and Kutch to start industrial enterprises, trading, and cargo centres. Alappuzha attained progress and became the financial nerve centre of Travancore during his time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=isbn:8170990262|title=isbn:8170990262 - Google Search|website=www.google.com}}</ref> The port was opened in 1762, mainly for the export of coir-matting and coir-yarn. Kesavadas built three ships for trade with Calcutta and Bombay, and alleppey afforded a convenient depot for the storage and disposal of goods produce in the east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prd.kerala.gov.in/d_alappuzha.htm|title=Alappuzha - A brief history|access-date=23 April 2020|archive-date=30 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930221743/http://prd.kerala.gov.in/d_alappuzha.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{wide image|File:VembanadAlleppey.jpg|800px|[[Vembanad Lake]]}}
Alappuzha is located at {{Coord|9.54|N|76.40|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/13/Alappuzha.html |title=Maps, Weather, Videos, and Airports for Alappuzha, India |publisher=Fallingrain.com |access-date=2013-09-25}}</ref> The average elevation is {{convert|1|m|ft}}.<ref>[http://population.mongabay.com/population/india/1278985/alleppey elevation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116031902/http://population.mongabay.com/population/india/1278985/alleppey |date=16 November 2011 }}</ref> Alappuzha covers an area of {{convert|1414|km2}} and is flanked by {{convert|2195|km2}} of [[Vembanad Lake]], where six major rivers spread out before joining the 80&nbsp;km coast line of the district. The city of Alappuzha is crisscrossed by a system of [[canal]]s, which is a part of the [[National Waterway 3 (India)|National Waterway 3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecohouseboat.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi|title=Account Suspended|website=ecohouseboat.com}}</ref>

The district is a sandy strip of land intercepted by lagoons, rivers and canals. There are no mountains or hills in the district except some scattered hillocks lying between [[Bharanikkavu]] and [[Chengannur]] blocks in the eastern portion of the district. There are no forest area in this district.

Alappuzha is bounded by the Laccadive Sea on its west. The town has a network of lakes, lagoons and [[fresh water]] rivers. The richness of the coastal Alappuzha waters is expressed annually in the blooming and consequent deposit of a huge quantity of fishes and [[prawns]] on the Alappuzha coast called ‘[Chakara]’. This annual shifting of sandbank appears during the post-monsoon period and contributes to the local economy and is a festive season for the people of Kerala. The annual floods rejuvenate and cleanse the soil and water due to which there is abundance of marine life like prawns, [[lobster]]s, fishes, turtles and other [[flora]] in the sea.

The [[Kerala Backwaters|backwaters]] and [[wetlands]] host thousands of migrant [[common teal]], [[duck]]s and [[cormorant]]s every year who reach here from long distances. A major feature of the area is the region called Kuttanad, the 'granary of Kerala'. [[Kuttanad]] is also known as the rice bowl of Kerala and is one of the few places in the world where farming is done below sea level. The paddy fields lie about 0.6 to 2 m below mean sea level.<ref name="alappuzha"/>

=== Climate ===
Owing to its proximity to the sea, the climate of Alappuzha is humid and hot during the summer, although it remains fairly cool and pleasant during the months of October and November. The average monthly temperature is 27 degrees Celsius. The district gets the benefit of two seasonal monsoons, as in other parts of the state. Alappuzha town experiences a long monsoon season with heavy showers as both the [[Southwest monsoon|Southwest]] and [[Northeast monsoon]] influences the weather of Alappuzha. The South-west monsoon affects the climate in the months from June to September. On the other hand, the North-east monsoon brings rain from October to November. The average rainfall received by the region is 2763&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/annualrainfall.htm|title=Annual Rainfall Map of India, Rainfall in India|website=Maps of India}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Alleppey Boat houses.jpg|thumb|A [[Houseboat]] in Alleppey]]
The economy of the district is based on agriculture and marine products. The agricultural activities predominantly revolve around the [[Kuttanad]] region, the rice bowl of Kerala. Though the district is industrially backward, some traditional industries based on [[coir]] and coir products, marine products, handlooms, different types of [[handicraft]]s, [[toddy tapping]] have been active from the very early times.

In recent times, tourism has become a major source of revenue. This is mainly due to the presence of [[houseboat]]s that provide the tourists with a view of the scenic backwaters of the town. Another reason is the proximity to other tourist spots like [[Munnar]], [[Varkala]] and [[Wayanad]]. Furthermore, as per the Tourist Statistics by Kerala Tourism, there is a 74.55% increase in tourists arriving in Alleppey between 2021 and 2020 while the average for the entire state stands at 51.09%.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tourism |first=Kerala |title=Kerala Statistics – 2021 - Highlights |url=https://www.keralatourism.org/tourismstatistics/tourist_statistics_202120220530122636.pdf |access-date=12 January 2023 |website=Kerala Tourism: Official Website |language=English}}</ref>

== Backwater paddy cultivation ==
{{Moresources|section|date=February 2023}}
[[Image:Kerala Kuttanad2.jpg|thumb|Paddy fields in Kuttanad]]
The major occupation in Alappuzha is farming. The Rice Bowl of Kerala, Kuttanadu is located in Alappuzha. Large farming areas near [[Vembanad Lake]] were reclaimed from the lake. In earlier times, the reclamation was done mainly from the shallow part of the [[Vembanad Lake]] or from the periphery of river Pamba. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called ''Padsekharam''. The bailing out of water from those fields were done manually using water wheels (''Chakram''). Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines.

Three stages can be identified in the reclamation of lands from the Vembanad Lake. In the first stage it was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the part of the government. The ''Pattom Proclamation'', made by the Travancore Kingdom in the year 1865, gave a great boost to the reclamation activities between 1865 and 1890. During this period de-watering of the polders were done manually, using waterwheels, restricting large-scale reclamations. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu Lake and Madathil Lake that were reclaimed during this period are considered as the first ''Kayal Nilam'' (lake-reclaimed land) which were reclaimed from Vembanad Lake.<ref>{{cite news

 |archive-date=27 September 2013 }}</ref> The period between 1865 and 1890 is usually considered as the first phase of lake-cultivation.

The introduction of kerosene engines for dewatering resulted in the reclamation of wider areas of the lake for cultivation. It made the farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by [[Pallithanam Luca Matthai|Pallithanam Luca Mathai]] (alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the Cherukara and Pallithanam Moovayiram kayals.

The second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on lake reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rama Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku Kayal, and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.

In 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travencore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this reclamation scheme areas were notified for reclamation in blocks each named by an alphabet letter. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of reclaimed land 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920 are known as new reclamations, which were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block (Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major reclamations during this period. During the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N measuring 3600 acres were reclaimed. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block measuring 1,400 acres were reclaimed.

Due to the steep decline in the price of rice during 1920 to 1940, the reclamation activities became sluggish, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase the agricultural output, government initiated a ''Grow More Food'' campaign and provided incentives to encourage new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made the reclamation easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to the earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period.<ref>{{cite web|last=Studies Society|first=Thiruvananthapuram Economic|date=August 2017|title=Agricultural Development of Kerala From 1800 AD to 1980 AD: A Survey of Studies|url=http://keralaeconomy.com/admin/pdfs/A%20Survey%20of%20Studies.pdf|website=keralaeconomy.com}}</ref>

[[File:Nehru Trophy Boat Race 2012 7791.JPG|250px|thumb|The [[Nehru Trophy Boat Race]] is a popular sport held in the Punnamada Lake near Alappuzha]]

Alappuzha is globally famous for snake boat races, especially the Nehru Trophy Boat Race held in the [[Punnamada Lake]] near Alappuzha. In 1952, when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first prime minister of India, visited Kerala, the people of Alleppey decided to give a special entertainment for their prestigious guest and conducted a snake boat race. Nehru got so excited by this event and he jumped into 'Nadubhagam Chundan' (a snake boat), ignoring the security officials. By this excitement of sailing in a snake boat he donated a rolling trophy to be awarded to the winner of the race. Other than this snake boat race [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[basketball]] and [[rowing]] are among the most popular sports in town. In 2015, the [[Kerala Cricket Association]] inaugurated the [[KCA Cricket Stadium Alappuzha]], which is an A-class cricket stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keralacricketassociation.com/Alappuzha-cg|title=SD College- KCA Cricket Ground- Alapuzha}}</ref> Another stadium named as EMS Stadium or municipal stadium is under construction as of 2021.
