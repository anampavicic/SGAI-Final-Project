It is the capital and largest city of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]], as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,<ref name="ine.es">[http://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=2861 Barcelona: Población por municipios y sexo] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806203350/http://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=2861 |date=6 August 2016 }} – Instituto Nacional de Estadística.

According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the [[Phoenicia]]ns or the [[Carthaginians]], who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.<ref name="britannica.com">{{Cite web |date=2024-07-28 |title=Barcelona - Catalan, Mediterranean, Architecture {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Barcelona/History |access-date=2024-07-29 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> In the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the [[County of Barcelona]]. After joining with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] to form the confederation of the [[Crown of Aragon]], Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the [[Principality of Catalonia]], became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by [[Valencia]], wrested from [[Al-Andalus|Moorish control]] by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the [[Crown of Castile]] and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of [[Catalan separatism]], briefly becoming part of [[France]] during the 17th century [[Reapers' War]] and again in 1812 until 1814 under [[Napoleon]]. It was the capital of [[Revolutionary Catalonia]] during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936]], and the seat of government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] later in the [[Spanish Civil War]], until its [[Francoist Spain|capture by the fascists]] in 1939. After the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia.

Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]], which have been designated UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the [[University of Barcelona]] and [[Pompeu Fabra University]]. The headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] as well as world-class [[#Trade fair and exhibitions|conferences and expositions]]. In addition, many [[sport in Barcelona#International tournaments|international sport tournaments]] have been played here.

An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is ''Barna''. ''Barça'' is only applied to the local football club [[FC Barcelona]], not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the [[IATA airport code]] of the [[Barcelona-El Prat Airport]].

The city is referred to as the ''Ciutat Comtal'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and ''Ciudad Condal'' in Spanish (i.e., "Comital City" or "City of Counts"), owing to its past as the seat of the [[Count of Barcelona]].<ref>[https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0017957.xml "Ciutat Comtal"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210711124438/https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0017957.xml |date=11 July 2021 }} entry in ''Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana'', Barcelona, Enciclopedia.cat, {{in lang|ca}}.

=== Roman Barcelona ===
{{See also|Roman Sepulchral way}}[[File:Barcino marble barcelona.jpg|thumb|left|A marble plaque in the Museu d'Història de la Ciutat de Barcelona, dated from around 110–130 AD and dedicated to the Roman colony of Barcino]]

In about 15&nbsp;BC, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] redrew the town as a ''[[castra|castrum]]'' (Roman military camp) centred on the "''Mons Taber''", a little hill near the [[Generalitat]] (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the [[Cardo Maximus]] and [[Decumanus Maximus]], was approximately placed where current [[Plaça de Sant Jaume]] is. Thus, the political centre of the city, [[Catalonia]], and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years.

Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of ''Faventia'',<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] iii. 3. s.&nbsp;4</ref> or, in full, ''Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino''<ref>Inscr. ap. Gruter, p. 426, nos. 5, 6.</ref> or ''Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino''. [[Pomponius Mela]]<ref>ii. 6</ref> mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour ''[[Tarragona|Tarraco]]'' (modern [[Tarragona]]), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.<ref>Avien. ''Ora Maritima.'' 520: "Et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium."</ref> It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.<ref>Paul. Dig. 1. tit. 15, de Cens.</ref> The city minted its own coins; some from the era of [[Galba]] survive.

Important Roman vestiges are displayed in [[Plaça del Rei]] underground, as a part of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Gothic Quarter).

=== Medieval Barcelona ===
The city was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all [[Hispania]]. After being conquered by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a [[Siege of Barcelona (801)|siege in 801]] by [[Charlemagne]]'s son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], who made Barcelona the seat of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] "[[Marca Hispanica|Hispanic March]]" (''Marca Hispanica''), a [[buffer zone]] ruled by the [[Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=GSM Barcelona - Barcelona History |url=https://www.gsmbarcelona.eu/default/gsmb-campus/barcelona-history |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=GSM Barcelona |language=en |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326033542/https://www.gsmbarcelona.eu/default/gsmb-campus/barcelona-history |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy ===
[[File:Wyngaerde Barcelona 1563.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Barcelona in 1563 by [[Anton van den Wyngaerde]]]]
In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=L' economia urbana de Barcelona i la Guerra de Successió|first=Manuel|last=Arranz|first2=Ramon|last2=Grau|page=117|journal=Recerques: història, economia, cultura|volume=24|year=1991|url=https://raco.cat/index.php/Recerques/article/view/137685/241497|issn=0210-380X}}</ref>

In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the [[The General Crisis|17th-century crisis]] in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.<ref>[[Stanley G.

In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.{{Sfn|Arranz|Grau|1991|p=135–136}}

In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to [[Zaragoza]], and to the south up to [[Alicante]].<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.3989/hispania.1998.v58.i199.645|url=https://hispania.revistas.csic.es/index.php/hispania/article/view/645/639|page=510|first=David R.|last=Ringrose|title=Historia urbana y urbanización en la España moderna|issn=1988-8368|location=Madrid|volume=58|issue=1999|year=1998|journal=Hispania|publisher=[[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]]|doi-access=free}}</ref> A fortress was built at [[Montjuïc]] that overlooked the harbour.

Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic wars]], but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve.

=== Transforming the city ===
In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named [[Ildefons Cerdà]] proposed a plan for a new district known as the [[Eixample]]. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerdà thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerdà's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerdà's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build "the biggest, tallest, most attractive house" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerdà's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bausells |first=Marta |date=2016-04-01 |title=Story of cities #13: Barcelona's unloved planner invents science of 'urbanisation' |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/01/story-cities-13-eixample-barcelona-ildefons-cerda-planner-urbanisation |access-date=2023-12-01 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=David |date=2019-04-08 |title=Barcelona's remarkable history of rebirth and transformation |url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/8/18266760/barcelona-spain-urban-planning-history |access-date=2023-12-01 |website=Vox |language=en |archive-date=4 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231204215206/https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/8/18266760/barcelona-spain-urban-planning-history |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== The Spanish Civil War and the Franco period ===

In the image [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña]] and [[Juan Negrín|Negrín]] on the city outskirts.]]
During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were [[Collective ownership|collectivized]] by the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona [[May Days]]. The [[Fall of Barcelona (1939)|fall of the city]] on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s ''coup d'état'' was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of [[Catalonia]] were abolished,<ref>Decree of 5 April 1938.</ref> and the use of the [[Catalan language]] in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which in turn led to rapid urbanization.

=== Late twentieth century ===
In 1992, Barcelona hosted the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]]. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and {{cvt|2|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=off}} of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.<ref>"[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53030/Barcelona Barcelona (Spain)]".

In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024–2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.<ref>{{Cite web |last=world |first=STIR |title=Barcelona announced as UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture throughout 2026 |url=https://www.stirworld.com/see-news-barcelona-announced-as-unesco-uia-world-capital-of-architecture-throughout-2026 |access-date=2023-12-01 |website=www.stirworld.com |language=English |archive-date=4 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231204215207/https://www.stirworld.com/see-news-barcelona-announced-as-unesco-uia-world-capital-of-architecture-throughout-2026 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as [[El Carmel|Carmel]] ({{cvt|267|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}), [[:es:Jardines del Turó del Putxet|Putxet]] (es) ({{cvt|181|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and [[Turó de la Rovira|Rovira]] ({{cvt|261|m|ft|abbr=off||disp=or}}). The escarpment of [[Montjuïc]] ({{cvt|173|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by [[Montjuïc Castle (Barcelona)|Montjuïc Castle]], a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest [[Parks and gardens of Barcelona|park and gardens]].

The city borders on the municipalities of [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]] to the north; the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east; [[El Prat de Llobregat]] and [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] to the south; and [[Sant Feliu de Llobregat]], [[Sant Just Desvern]], [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]], and [[Montcada i Reixac]] to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited [[exclave]]s to the north-west.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Barcelona}}
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Barcelona has a hot summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa''), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahrens |first=C. Donald |date=2012 |title=Meteorology Today: An Introduction to Weather, Climate, and the Environment, 10th Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cD6CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA504 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0840054999}}</ref> while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) [[dry season]] in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as "Portuguese" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of [[Emmanuel de Martonne]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Viers |first=Georges |date=1987 |title=Climatología |trans-title=Climatology |language=es |location=Barcelona |publisher=Oikos-Tau |isbn=9788428102957}}, pp.166-167</ref> and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. [[Marseille#Climate|Marseille]]), can be seen as transitional to the [[humid subtropical climate#Europe|humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') found in inland areas.

Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the [[urban heat island effect]]. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2&nbsp;°C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=0076&k=cat |title=Valores Climatológicos Normales.

The average annual temperature of the sea is about {{cvt|20|°C|°F}}. In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from {{cvt|12|to|18|C|F}} during the day, {{cvt|6|to|12|C|F}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{cvt|13|°C|°F}}.<ref name="weather2travel">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/spain/barcelona.php |title=Weather2Travel.com: Barcelona Climate Guide |access-date=16 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005932/http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/spain/barcelona.php |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from {{cvt|27|to|31|C|F}} during the day, about {{cvt|23|°C|°F}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{cvt|26|°C|°F}}.<ref name=weather2travel/> Generally, the summer or "holiday" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds {{cvt|20|°C|0}}, with an average temperature of {{cvt|18|-|19|C|F}} during the day and {{cvt|11|-|13|C|F}} at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around {{cvt|15|°C|°F}} during the day and {{cvt|9|°C|°F}} at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the [[urban heat island]], frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby [[Collserola]] mountains, such as in the [[Fabra Observatory]] located in a nearby mountain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=0200E&k=cat |title=Valores climatológicos normales.

Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1&nbsp;mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524&nbsp;hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5&nbsp;hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10&nbsp;hours of sunshine a day) in July.<ref name="Meteorología">{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=0076&k=cat |title=Valores Climatológicos Normales.

=== Population density ===
[[File:Evening light over Barcelona.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Aerial view of the centre and the Eixample, with the [[Serra de Collserola]] at the background]]
Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with [[Eixample]] being the most populated district.<ref name="council">This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2023}}

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited [[Zona Franca (Barcelona)|Zona Franca]] industrial area and [[Montjuïc]] forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5&nbsp;million inhabitants living on the remaining {{cvt|52|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.<ref name="council"/>{{full citation needed|date=November 2023}}

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of [[Sagrada Família, Barcelona|la Sagrada Família]] where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.<ref name="council"/>{{full citation needed|date=November 2023}}

=== Age structure ===
In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://w3.grupobbva.com/TLFU/dat/05_barcelona.pdf |title=La población de Barcelona |author=Fundación BBVA |access-date=6 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106095806/http://w3.grupobbva.com/TLFU/dat/05_barcelona.pdf |archive-date=6 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/castella/dades/anuari/cap02/C020104.htm |title=Poblacion por edades quinquenales y sexo. 2017 |author=Ajuntament de Barcelona |date=1 January 2017 |author-link=Ajuntament de Barcelona |access-date=6 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506060005/http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/castella/dades/anuari/cap02/C020104.htm |archive-date=6 May 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in [[Catalonia]] and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.<ref name="ASTBCN" />

The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).<ref name="ASTBCN" /> Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] or [[Colombia]]. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Sian Preece |title=The Routledge Handbook of Language and Identity |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |page=513}}</ref>

There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in [[Ciutat Vella]]. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/features/report-barcelona-pakistani-community/ "Barcelona's Pakistani community"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611180354/http://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/features/report-barcelona-pakistani-community/ |date=11 June 2017 }}, retrieved 12 June 2017.</ref>

Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the [[Philippines]].<ref name="ASTBCN" /> There is a Japanese community clustered in [[Bonanova]], [[Les Tres Torres]], [[Pedralbes]], and other northern neighbourhoods, and a [[Colegio Japonés de Barcelona|Japanese international school]] serves that community.<ref>Conte-Helm, Marie.

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.

[[Borsa de Barcelona]] (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://w42.bcn.cat/web/en/noticies-i-premsa/noticies/actives/Barcelona-recognized-as-the-top-Southern-European-city-with-future-economic-potential.jsp |title=Barcelona, recognised as the top Southern European city with future economic potential |date=5 March 2014 |access-date=11 April 2014 |website=Barcelona Growth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413160012/http://w42.bcn.cat/web/en/noticies-i-premsa/noticies/actives/Barcelona-recognized-as-the-top-Southern-European-city-with-future-economic-potential.jsp |archive-date=13 April 2014}}</ref> by ''[[FDi Magazine]]'' in their bi-annual rankings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/Europe/European-Cities-and-Regions-of-the-Future-2014-15 |title=European Cities and Regions of the Future 2014/15 |date=17 February 2014 |access-date=11 April 2014 |work=fDi Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112110111/http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/Europe/European-Cities-and-Regions-of-the-Future-2014-15 |archive-date=12 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

It also has several congress halls, notably [[Fira de Barcelona]] – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is {{cvt|405000|m2|ha|0}}, not counting [[Gran Via (Barcelona)|Gran Via centre]] on the [[Plaza de Europa]]. However, the [[Eurozone crisis]] and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.

An important business centre, the [[World Trade Center Barcelona]], is located in Barcelona's [[Port Vell]] harbour.

The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 ''[[Exposición Universal de Barcelona]]'', the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]] (Expo 1929), the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] and the 2004 [[World Urban Forum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Urban Forum 2004 |url=http://mirror.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=467 |access-date=1 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315031755/http://mirror.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=467 |archive-date=15 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,{{Citation needed|reason=Which report?|date=July 2020}} the city is "overrun [by] hordes of tourists". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included "Tourists go home", "Barcelona is not for sale" and "We will not be driven out". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7&nbsp;million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62&nbsp;million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30&nbsp;billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.<ref>{{cite news |last=Burgen |first=Stephen |date=25 June 2018 |title='Tourists go home, refugees welcome': why Barcelona chose migrants over visitors |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=3 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902145924/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors |archive-date=2 September 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

As in other modern cities, the [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]] has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, [[pharmaceutical]], motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable [[Mobile World Congress]], and information technology services.

The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a [[Fashion in Barcelona|fashion capital]], notably ''Gaudi Home''.{{citation needed|reason=who or what is Gaudi Home; need cite for it and more info|date=January 2014}}

Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the [[Bread & Butter (tradeshow)|Bread & Butter urban fashion fair]] until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to [[Berlin]].

As the capital of the autonomous community of [[Catalonia]], Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the ''[[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat de Catalunya]]''; of particular note are the [[Government of Catalonia|executive branch]], the [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]], and the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]]. The city is also the capital of the [[Province of Barcelona]] and the [[Barcelonès]] [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] (district).

Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|elected]] for a four-year term by [[universal suffrage]]. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the ''Carta Municipal'' (Municipal Law).

The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|coming of the Spanish democracy]], Barcelona [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|had been governed]] by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]], first with an [[Majority|absolute majority]] and later in coalition with [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens|ICV]]. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, [[Convergence and Union|CiU]] gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

=== Districts ===
[[File:Districtes de Barcelona.svg|right|thumb|Districts of Barcelona]]
{{main|Districts of Barcelona}}
{{See also|Street names in Barcelona}}

Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10&nbsp;administrative [[Districts of Barcelona|districts]] (''districtes'' in Catalan, ''distritos'' in Spanish):
*[[Ciutat Vella]]
*[[Eixample]]
*[[Sants-Montjuïc]]
*[[District of Les Corts|Les Corts]]
*[[Sarrià-Sant Gervasi]]
*[[Gràcia]]
*[[Horta-Guinardó]]
*[[Nou Barris]]
*[[Sant Andreu]]
*[[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]]

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns [[Street names in Barcelona#Municipal aggregations|annexed]] by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

[[IESE]] Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the [[Ramon Llull University]], which encompasses schools and institutes such as the [[ESADE]] Business School. The [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]], another public university, is located in [[Bellaterra]], a town in the [[Àmbit metropolità de Barcelona|Metropolitan Area]]. [[Toulouse Business School]] and the [[Open University of Catalonia]] (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.

The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as ''escoles concertades'', they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (''escoles privades'').

The language of instruction at public schools and ''escoles concertades'' is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or ''escola concertada'' in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or ''escola concertada'' offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

=== Metro and regional rail ===
[[File:LlefiàL10.JPG|thumb|right|Barcelona Metro]]
Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a [[rapid transit|metro]] system, a bus network, a [[Commuter rail|regional railway]] system, trams, [[funicular]]s, [[rack railway]]s, a [[Gondola lift]] and [[aerial tramway|aerial cable cars]]. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the [[Autoritat del Transport Metropolità]] (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmb.cat/en/abonaments-integrats |title=Integrated travel cards – Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona |work=tmb.cat |access-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824054620/http://www.tmb.cat/en/abonaments-integrats |archive-date=24 August 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Barcelona Metro]] network comprises twelve lines, identified by an "L" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the [[Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona]] (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the {{Lang|ca|[[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]|italic=no}} (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.

In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's [[Rodalies de Catalunya]] run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.

=== Funicular and cable car ===
Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the [[Funicular de Tibidabo]] up the hill of [[Tibidabo]] and the [[Funicular de Vallvidrera]] (FGC), while TMB runs the [[Funicular de Montjuïc]] up [[Montjuïc]]. The city has two aerial cable cars: the [[Montjuïc Cable Car]], which serves Montjuïc castle, and the [[Port Vell Aerial Tramway]] that runs via [[Torre Jaume I]] and [[Torre Sant Sebastia|Torre Sant Sebastià]] over the port.

=== Bus ===
Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Plaça de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.

The [[Estació del Nord Sports Hall|Estació del Nord]] (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.

=== Roads and highways ===
[[File:085_Ronda_de_Dalt_(Barcelona),_des_del_pont_de_l'avinguda_del_Tibidabo.jpg|thumb|[[B-20 motorway (Spain)|B-20 motorway]] in Barcelona]]

Barcelona lies on three international routes, including [[European route E15]] that follows the Mediterranean coast, [[European route E90]] to Madrid and Lisbon, and [[European route E09]] to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including [[Autovía A-2|A-2]], [[Autovía A-7|A-7]]/[[Autopista AP-7|AP-7]], [[C-16 highway (Spain)|C-16]], [[C-17 highway (Spain)|C-17]], [[C-31 highway (Spain)|C-31]], [[C-32 highway (Spain)|C-32]], [[Autopista C-33|C-33]], [[Autovia C-60|C-60]].

The city is circled by three half [[Beltway|ring roads]] or bypasses, [[B20 motorway (Spain)|Ronda de Dalt (B-20)]] (on the mountain side), [[B10 motorway (Spain)|Ronda del Litoral (B-10)]] (along the coast) and [[Ronda del Mig]] (separated into two parts: [[Travessera de Dalt]] in the north and the [[Gran Via de Carles III]]), two partially covered<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |title=The covered Rondes (by-pass) |publisher=Bcn.es |access-date=26 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516235933/http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |archive-date=16 May 2009}}</ref> fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city's main arteries include [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Diagonal Avenue]], which crosses it diagonally, [[Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona|Meridiana Avenue]] which leads to [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, Barcelona|Glòries]] and connects with Diagonal Avenue and [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, Barcelona|Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]], which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]], whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.

The ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'' architecture (related to the movement known as [[Art Nouveau]] in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the [[Sagrada Família]], which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. {{As of|2015}}, completion is planned for 2026.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/sagrada-familia-reaches-its-final-stage-of-construction/413476/ |title=Gaudí's Barcelona Basilica, La Sagrada Família, Reaches Its Final Stage of Construction – The Atlantic |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=1 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312083828/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/sagrada-familia-reaches-its-final-stage-of-construction/413476/ |archive-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Barcelona was also home to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Barcelona Pavilion]]. Designed in 1929 for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International Exposition]] for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details".<ref name="Rybczynski2001">{{cite book |author=Witold Rybczynski |title=The Look of Architecture |url=https://archive.org/details/lookofarchitectu00rybc |url-access=registration |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-515633-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lookofarchitectu00rybc/page/n111 94]–}}</ref> The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] for its architecture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf |title=RIBA Royal Gold Medallists |publisher=RIBA |access-date=28 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101307/http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/Royal%20Gold%20Medallists%201848%20-%202008.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2014}}</ref> the first (and {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared [[World Heritage Site]]s by [[UNESCO]]:<ref>The seventh element of Place [[World Heritage]] "Works of [[Antoni Gaudí]]" is the Crypt in [[Colònia Güell]], which is located at [[Santa Coloma de Cervelló]].</ref>

Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|National Museum of Art of Catalonia]] possesses a well-known collection of [[Romanesque art]], while the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]] focuses on [[Post-war|post-1945]] Catalan and [[Spanish art]]. The [[Fundació Joan Miró]], [[Museu Picasso|Picasso Museum]], and [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies]] hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the [[Can Framis Museum]], focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by [[Fundacio Vila Casas|Fundació Vila Casas]].

Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''<ref name="NationalGeographic">{{cite web |url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/#/beach-barcelona-spain_21757_600x450.jpg |title=Top 10 Beach Cities |date=8 July 2010 |access-date=30 July 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100721215624/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/ |archive-date= 21 July 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and ''[[Discovery Channel]]''.<ref name="DiscoveryChannel">Movie "Worlds Best Beaches", Discovery Channel 2005 {{YouTube|8bdvj5gubnA}}</ref> Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling {{cvt|4.5|km|mi|frac=4|abbr=off}} of coastline. [[Sant Sebastià]], [[La Barceloneta, Barcelona|Barceloneta]] and [[Somorrostro]] beaches, both {{cvt|1100|m|ft|-1}} in length,<ref name="guies_estadistiques"/> are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.

The [[Olympic Harbour]] separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from {{cvt|400|to|640|m|ft}} were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season.
