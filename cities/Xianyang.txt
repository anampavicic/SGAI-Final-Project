'''Xianyang''' ({{zh|s=咸阳 |p=Xiányáng}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Shaanxi]] province, situated on the [[Wei River]] a few kilometers upstream (west) from the provincial capital of [[Xi'an]]. Once the capital of the [[Qin dynasty]], it is now integrated into the [[Xi'an]] metropolitan area, one of the main urban agglomerations in [[northwestern China]], with more than 7.17 million inhabitants. Its built-up area, consisting of 2 urban [[District (China)|districts]] (Qindu and Weicheng), had 945,420 inhabitants at the [[2010 Chinese census|2010 census]]. It has a total area of {{convert|10213|km2|mi2|sp=us}}.

Xianyang is the seat of the [[Xi'an Xianyang International Airport]], the main airport serving [[Xi'an]] and the largest airport in [[Northwest China]], and one of the 40 [[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest airports]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 2021 |title=2020 Airport Traffic Report |url=https://www.panynj.gov/content/dam/airports/statistics/statistics-general-info/annual-atr/ATR_2020.pdf |access-date=26 Sep 2021 |publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] |page=30 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.panynj.gov/content/dam/airports/statistics/statistics-general-info/annual-atr/ATR2019.pdf |title=2019 Annual Airport Traffic Report |publisher=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. |year=2020 |location=United States}}</ref>

==History==
{{more citations needed|date=August 2012}}

Xianyang was among the capital city's environs during the [[Western Zhou dynasty]], and was made the capital of the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]] in 350 BC during the [[Warring States period]] before becoming the capital of China during the short-lived [[Qin dynasty]].<ref name="diming">{{cite book |script-title=zh:中国古今地名大词典 |publisher=[[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] |language= zh-cn |page=2134 |isbn=978-753261743-2|year=2005 }}</ref> Because the city lay south of the Jiuzong Mountains and north of the [[Wei River]] – both sunlight-rich (''[[Yin and yang|yang]]'') orientations – it was named "Xianyang", meaning "fully ''yang''".<ref name="diming" />

Under [[Duke Xiao of Qin]]'s reign, minister [[Shang Yang]] designed Xianyang and in 350 BC organized the relocation of Qin's administration from the old capital [[Yueyang (Qin)|Yueyang]] to the new city, which was then the capital for over 140 years. It was located in the modern day Shaanxi province on the northern bank of the [[Wei River]], on the opposite side of which [[Liu Bang]] would later build the [[Han dynasty]] capital of [[Chang'an]] once he became emperor.

In 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang]] eliminated all six other warring states to establish the [[Qin dynasty|first centralized empire in Chinese history]]. Xianyang became the center of politics, economy and culture of the Qin empire. Noble families were compelled to move into Xianyang, and the realm's weapons were gathered in the city to be melted and cast into twelve towering statues. The Emperor had a lavish [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|mausoleum]] built near the capital, complete with his [[Terracotta Army]]. This and other large undertakings diverted enormous levels of manpower and resources away from agriculture. Coupled with the state's repressive measures on the population, these factors eventually led to the fall of the Qin dynasty and with it the original city of Xianyang.{{Sfn | Meyer |1997| pp =91–95}}

Qin Shi Huang expanded Xianyang beyond the walls. Then he built replicas of the palaces of all the conquered states along the Wei River. In 220 BC, he built Xin Palace ({{zh|labels=no|c=新城 |p=Xīnchéng}}) and later renamed it Wei Palace ({{zh|labels=no|c=渭城|p=Wèichéng}}), named after the Wei River. He continued with the theme of earth as the mirror of heaven building a network of 300 palaces in the Wei valley connected by elevated roads. In 212 BC, he built the Epang Palace ({{zh|labels=no|t=阿房宮 |p=Ēpánggōng}}).

Shortly after the First Emperor's death in 210 BC revolts erupted. At the beginning of December 207 BC, the last Qin emperor [[Ziying of Qin|Ziying]] surrendered to rebel leader [[Liu Bang]], who entered Xianyang peacefully without harming the locals. However, Liu Bang was forced to hand the city over to another more ruthless rebel leader, [[Xiang Yu]], whose army greatly outnumbered Liu Bang's. Xiang Yu then killed Ziying and burned Xianyang in 206 BC,<ref>Cotterell, page 29.</ref> destroying the sole surviving copies of several [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|banned books]] that were kept in the royal library.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Asia : a concise history|last=Meyer | first = Milton Walter |date= 1997 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0847680681|page =92|oclc= 33276519}}</ref>

In 202 BC, after defeating Xiang Yu in [[Battle of Gaixia]] and ending the [[Chu-Han contention]], Liu Bang was crowned the emperor of the newly established [[Han dynasty]], and he built a new capital across the [[Wei River]] merely miles from the ruins of old Xianyang and named this new city [[Chang'an]]. The Han-era town of '''Anling''' ({{zh|labels=no|c=安陵}}, tomb of [[Emperor Hui of Han|emperor Hui]]) was located nearby and houses some of the Han dynasty's mausoleums.

=== Archeology ===
From the end of the 1950s until the middle of the 1990s, archeologists discovered and excavated numerous Qin era sites in Xianyang, including palaces, workshops and tombs.
