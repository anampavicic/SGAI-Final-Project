'''Pasto''', officially '''San Juan de Pasto''' ({{IPA|es|saŋ ˈxwan de ˈpasto}}; "Saint John of Pasto"), is the capital of the [[Departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Nariño]], in southern [[Colombia]]. Pasto was founded in 1537 and named after indigenous people of the area. In the 2018 census, the municipality had a population of 392,930. Pasto is located in the Atriz Valley on the [[Andes]] [[mountain range|cordillera]], at the foot of the [[Galeras]] [[volcano]].

== History ==
The etymology of the word ''Pasto'' can be traced to the [[indigenous people]] who inhabited the region at the arrival of the Spanish conquerors, the Pastos. However, the [[Atriz Valley]] itself was inhabited by the [[Quillacinga]]s. In the 2018 Colombian census, 163,873 people self-identified as Pasto, and in the 2010 Ecuadorian census, 1,409 people self-identified as Pasto.

Pasto was founded in 1537 by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]]. In 1539 [[Lorenzo de Aldana]], also a Spanish conquistador, moved the city to its current location, and established it under the name "San Juan de Pasto". A major contributor to the economy and expansion of Pasto was a man of Italian origin named [[Guido Bucheli]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Pasto has been an administrative, cultural and religious center of the [[Pacific/Chocó natural region|region]] since colonial times. Because of this, the city is known as the theological city of Colombia.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} During the [[Patria Boba|Independence Wars against Spain]] Pasto was a royalist city. Partly due to this political stance, and because of its geographical location, after independence, Pasto remained isolated for a long time from the rest of Colombia.

== Geography ==

Most of the city lies between {{convert|2520|m|ft|abbr=}} and {{convert|2700|m|ft}} elevation above sea level, while some settlement exceeds {{convert|3000|m|ft}} on the flanks of the Galeras Volcano, which stands at {{convert|4276|m|ft}}.

{{wide image|Pano1 peq.jpg|1000px|Overview of Pasto, from the north of the city.}}

==Climate==
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Pasto features an unusual altitude-influenced [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csb'') that tends to possess the wet season of the southern hemisphere, for example the section of [[Quito]] that is south of the equator. Pasto has relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year. Despite the fact that the city is located close to the equator, due to its high altitude, Pasto's average high temperatures typically range only between {{convert|15|and|18|°C|1}} while average low temperatures are usually between {{convert|9|and|11|°C|1}}. Pasto averages roughly {{convert|800|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rainfall annually.

[[Image:Pasto 20060106 001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Carnival]] [[Float (parade)|float]] Pasto, Colombia]]

One of the most important events held by the city is the [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]] (''Carnaval de Negros y Blancos '' in Spanish), with outstanding displays of craftsmanship in floats portraying legends and traditions, often mixed in with references to current political events in Colombia. These floats take years for the craftsmen to create for the Carnaval de Negros y Blancos. During the carnival, the city goes wild and unleashes all the joy it has bottled up all year, and the streets are flooded with people and celebrations. It is not advisable to wear nice clothes during this festival, as during these celebrations people have fun painting each other's faces with cosmetic colors (skin safe and created for this special purpose) and throwing colorful [[talc|talcum powder]] and party [[foam]]. The carnival takes place between January 2 and 7 each year.

A specialty of this region is a pre-Columbian art technique called ''Barniz de Pasto'', or Pasto Varnish in English. This uses a type of natural rubber (extracted from a tree called mopa-mopa) which is colored and then stretched over woodwork pieces; finally, the skillful artisan uses a special knife to cut and create the many beautiful designs that characterize this artistic technique.

==Gastronomy==

The dishes that most represent the gastronomy of Pasto are the products of mixed cultures, the expression of the land's fertility and the hard work of the people. The most typical is grilled or roasted [[guinea pig]] (locally called 'cuy'). On January 7, they celebrate the festival of the guinea pig in the nearby village of Catambuco as the culmination of the "Blacks and Whites Carnival". Among the typical outstanding desserts are: "bucket ice-cream", made in a copper bucket cooled with crushed ice; 'chilacuán', a dessert made with [[mountain papaya]]s; and dough-based pastries, of which 'quimbolitos' and filled pasties (empanadas de añejo) are the best known.

Some of the typical drinks are made of [[lulo]], [[Mora (drink)|mora]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]]. These make the base of a drink that may be strengthened by a local liquor called chapil or [[aguardiente]].

The city has developed an extensive sports culture, both recreational and competitive. [[Association football|Football]] is one of the main sports practiced in the city since November 1909 when Leslie Osmond Spain, a British citizen who was visiting the area for commercial purposes, organised a football match in a makeshift court in the Barrio of San Andrés, and formed the first football team three months into his stay.<ref>Munoz, Lydia Agnes.

The city is home to [[Deportivo Pasto]], a team founded in 1949, which was a semi-pro team until 1996 when it was promoted to the [[Categoría Primera B|Primera B]], which turned the club professional. Two years later it was promoted to the top league of Colombian professional football, the [[Categoría Primera A|Primera A]]. In June 2006, the club was crowned champion of the league for the first time in its history, sending the city's residents into celebrations.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=25 June 2006|title=Deportivo Pasto ganó su primer título de campeón|url=https://caracol.com.co/radio/2006/06/25/deportes/1151254020_302258.html|access-date=|website=Caracol Radio|language=es}}</ref>

Pasto is home to many outstanding athletes, which include the race walker [[Luis Fernando López (race walker)|Luis Fernando López]] (medalist in the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics|2011 World Athletics Championships]]), and footballer [[Carlos Daniel Hidalgo]] (top scorer of the [[2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship|2003 FIFA U-17 World Cup]]).

In Pasto, as in other towns of [[Nariño Department|Nariño]] and in some regions of Ecuador, a traditional sport, very old and unparalleled in other regions of Colombia, called [[Chaza]] is practiced.
