'''Bengkulu''' ({{IPA|id|bəŋˈkulu}}), historically known as '''Bencoolen''', is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]]. It is located on the southwest coast of [[Sumatra]]. It was formed on 18 November 1968 by separating out the area of the historic [[Bencoolen Residency]] from the province of [[South Sumatra]] under Law No. 9 of 1967 and was finalized by Government Regulation No. 20 of 1968. Spread over 20,130.21&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, its area is comparable to the European country of [[Slovenia]] and it is bordered by the provinces of [[West Sumatra]] to the north, [[Jambi]] to the northeast, [[Lampung]] to the southeast, and [[South Sumatra]] to the east, and by the [[Indian Ocean]] to the northwest, south, southwest, and west.

Bengkulu is the 28th largest province by area; it is divided into nine regencies and the city of [[Bengkulu (city)|Bengkulu]], the capital and the only independent city. Bengkulu is also the 26th largest province by population in Indonesia, with 1,715,518 inhabitants at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2,010,670 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,086,006 (comprising 1,065,992 males and 1,020,014 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Bengkulu Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.17)</ref> According to a release by [[Badan Pusat Statistik]], it has the eleventh highest Human Development Index among the provinces, with a score of about 0.744 in 2013. By 2014, the province is positioned 28th highest in [[gross domestic product]] and 20th highest in life expectancy, 70.35 years.

Bengkulu also includes offshore Mega Island and [[Enggano Island]] in the Indian Ocean. Bengkulu has 525 kilometres of coastline along the Indian Ocean on its western side, from Dusun Baru Pelokan in Mukomuko Regency to Tebing Nasal in Kaur Regency. Bengkulu has many natural resources such as coal and gold, and has big and potential geothermal resources.<ref>{{Cite web |last=EJOLT |title=Bengkulu Coal-fired Power Plant, Indonesia {{!}} EJAtlas |url=https://ejatlas.org/conflict/bengkulu-coal-fired-power-plant-bengkulu-province-indonesia |access-date=2023-04-26 |website=[[Environmental Justice Atlas]] |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sari |first=Meri Maya |title=Kajian Efektivitas Pelaksanaan Amdal Bidang Energi Dan Sumber Daya Mineral Dalam Pelestarian Kawasan Lindung di Kabupaten Bengkulu Tengah |date=2017-04-21 |url=https://journal.ipb.ac.id/index.php/jpsl/article/view/13803 |journal=Jurnal Pengelolaan Sumberdaya Alam Dan Lingkungan (Journal of Natural Resources and Environmental Management) |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=61–71 |doi=10.29244/jpsl.7.1.61-71 |issn=2086-4639|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, it is less developed than other provinces in Sumatra.

==Etymology==
[[File:Bengkulu Maps.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bengkulu]]
Traditional sources suggest that the name Bengkulu or Bangkahulu derived from the word ''bangkai'' and ''hulu'' which means 'carcasses located in a stream'. According to the story, there was once a war between small kingdoms in Bengkulu, resulting in many casualties from both sides in the streams of Bengkulu. These casualties soon rotted as they were not buried, lying in river streams. This etymology is similar to the story of a war between the [[Majapahit Empire]] and the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] in Padang Sibusuk, an area once ruled by the [[Dharmasraya]] empire, which also derives the name Padang Sibusuk from casualties rotting on the battlefield. During the European colonial era, the region was known as '''Bencoolen''' or '''[[British Bencoolen]]'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wftw.nl/bencoolen/bencoolen.html |access-date=May 10, 2016|title= A History on the Honourable East India Company's Garrison on the West Coast of Sumatra 1685–1825}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Indonesia.htm#Bencoolen |access-date=May 10, 2016|title= Bencoolen (Bengkulen)}}</ref>

The region was subject to the Buddhist Srivijaya empire in the 8th century. The Shailendra Kingdom and Singosari Kingdom succeeded the Srivijaya but it is unclear whether they spread their influence over Bengkulu. The Majapahit also had little influence over Bengkulu.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=113|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref> There were only few smalls ‘kedatuan’ based on ethnicity such as in  Sungai Serut,  Selebar,  Pat Petulai, Balai Buntar, Sungai Lemau, Sekiris, Gedung Agung and Marau Riang.

The first European visitors to the area were the Portuguese, followed by the Dutch in 1596.  The British [[East India Company]] established a [[black pepper|pepper]]-trading center and garrison at Bengkulu (Bencoolen) in 1685.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bencoolen, Fort Marlborough of the East India Company |url=http://wftw.nl/bencoolen/bencoolen.html |access-date=2023-04-26 |website=wftw.nl}}</ref> In 1714 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] built [[Fort Marlborough]], which still stands. The trading post was never profitable for the British, being hampered by a location which Europeans found unpleasant, and by an inability to find sufficient pepper to buy.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It became an occasional [[List of ports of call of the British East India Company|port of call]] for the EIC's [[East Indiamen]].

In 1785, the area was integrated into [[British Empire]] as [[British Bencoolen|Bencoolen]], while the rest of Sumatra and most of the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]] was part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] was stationed as  [[Governors of Bencoolen|Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen]] (the colony was subordinate at the time to the [[Bengal Presidency]]) from 1818 to 1824, enacting a number of reforms including the abolition of slavery, and the British presence left a number of monuments and forts in the area. Despite the difficulties of keeping control of the area while Dutch colonial power dominated the rest of Sumatra, the British persisted, maintaining their presence for roughly 140 years before ceding Bengkulu to the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] as part of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] in exchange for [[Malacca]].<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=34|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/34/}}</ref> Bengkulu then remained part of the [[Dutch East Indies]] until the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]] in World War 2.

[[File:Exile house of Sukarno, Bengkulu 2015-04-19 06.jpg|thumb|Sukarno's exile house in Bengkulu|left]]

During the early 1930s, [[Sukarno]], the future first president of Indonesia, was imprisoned by the Dutch and briefly resided in Bengkulu,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Indonesia - Toward independence {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Indonesia/Toward-independence |access-date=2023-04-26 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> where he met his wife, [[Fatmawati]]. The couple had several children, including [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], who later became Indonesia's first female President.

After independence, Bengkulu was initially part of the '[[South Sumatra]]' Province, which also included [[Lampung]], the [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung Islands]], and what is now South Sumatra itself, as a Residency. In 1968, Bengkulu gained provincial status, becoming the 26th province of Indonesia, preceding [[East Timor]].

Bengkulu lies near the Sunda Fault and is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. The June [[2000 Enggano earthquake]] killed at least 100 people.

The most widely spoken language in the province, [[Rejangese language|Rejang]], is the only [[Bornean languages|Bornean language]] to be spoken in [[Sumatra]] (and one of three outside of Borneo other than [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] in [[Madagascar]] and [[Yakan language|Yakan]] in [[Basilan province|Basilan]]).

[[Enggano language|Engganese]] is classified as a highly divergent branch of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], however, this is still  debated.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}{{who|date=April 2020}}. A less-studied language is [[Nasal language]], which may be related to Rejang or form its own branch of Malayo-Polynesian. Non-indigenous ethnic groups also speak their own language/dialects.
