'''San Juan de Dios de Cárdenas''', or simply '''Cárdenas''' ({{IPA|es|ˈkaɾðenas}}), is a municipality and city in the [[Matanzas Province]] of [[Cuba]],<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Cárdenas|volume=5|page=316}}</ref> about {{convert|116|km|mi|abbr=on}} by air [{{convert|156|km|mi|abbr=on}} by road] east of [[Havana]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.distancecalculator.net/ |title=Distance Calculator}}</ref> Cárdenas is the [[List of cities in Cuba|15th most-populated Cuban city]] and the second most populated one not being a provincial seat, after [[Manzanillo, Cuba|Manzanillo]].

The Cuban Flag was first raised over Cuba in this historic city of straight and narrow streets (the "Charleston of the Caribbean"), horse-drawn carriages, industry and "cangrejos" ([[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoutreachfoundation.org/blog/2017/2/22/more-than-history-gods-unfolding-mission-in-crdenas-cuba|title = More than History – God's Unfolding Mission in Cárdenas, Cuba}}</ref> It was in Cárdenas where [[José Arechabala S.A.]] launched and started production of [[Havana Club]] in 1934.

Cárdenas is the northernmost municipality in Cuba.

==Geography==
===Overview===
Cárdenas is a maritime port town on the level and somewhat marshy shore of a spacious bay of the northern coast of the island ([[Bay of Cárdenas]]), sheltered by a long promontory ([[Hicacos peninsula]],<ref name=EB1911/> including the [[Varadero]] beach resort). The city lies between the sea and hills.<ref name=EB1911/>

A large quantity of asphalt has been taken from the bed of the harbour. A flow of fresh water from the bed of the harbour is another peculiar feature; it presumably comes from the outlets of subterranean rivers.<ref name=EB1911/>

There are mostly narrow streets, various squares (including the Plaza de Colón, with a bronze statue of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] given to the city by Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II.]] and erected in 1862)<ref name=EB1911/> and substantial and elegant business and public buildings, including the ornate parish church designed by Architect Rafael Carrerá, who also built the famous Palacio Aldama in Central Havana.<ref>[http://www.atenas.inf.cu/todo/Municipios/MunicipioCardenas.htm Cardenas Ciudad Bandera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516052034/http://www.atenas.inf.cu/todo/Municipios/MunicipioCardenas.htm |date=2007-05-16 }} (Spanish)</ref>

===Subdivision===
Before the 1976 reform, Cárdenas was divided into the [[barrio]]s of Cantel, Fundición, Guásimas, Marina, Méndez Capote, Pueblo Nuevo and Versalles.<ref name=guije>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guije.com/pueblo/municipios/mcardenas/index.htm|title=Cárdenas|author=Guije.com|access-date=2007-10-07|language=es}}</ref>

The world-famous beach and resort town of [[Varadero]] is part of the municipality. Other villages included in the territory are [[Boca de Camarioca]], [[Enriqueta García Martín#Buena Vista|Buena Vista]], [[Camarioca]], Cantel, Central José Smith Comas, Dos de Diciembre, El Castillito, Guásimas, Humberto Álvarez, Julián Alemán, La Emilia, Los Morúa, Méndez Capote, Merceditas, Precioso, San Joaquín de Mora, [[Santa Marta (Cárdenas)|Santa Marta]] and Siguapa.

==History==
[[File:Scenes of Cuba (K5 01978) (5975088175).jpg|thumb|Beach of Cárdenas]]
[[File:Scenes of Cuba (K5 01998) (5974421607).jpg|thumb|Cave of Saturno in Cárdenas]]
Cárdenas was founded on 8 March 1828,<ref name=guije/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Aguirre Medrano |first1=Fidel |title=Historia de los hospitales coloniales de Hispanoamérica: Cuba |date=1992 |publisher=Editorial Arenas |isbn=978-1-56578-007-1 |page=640 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mhgAAAAMAAJ |language=es}}</ref> with the help of several old aristocratic Spanish-Cuban families from the nearby provincial capital of [[Matanzas]] and in 1861 already had 12,910 inhabitants. The completion of the [[railroad]] in 1841 led to further development. Cárdenas was one of the first cities in Cuba to have electric service, public transportation (trams), telegraph and telephone.

The city was not laid out in the traditional central-plaza Spanish custom, but rather, inspired on a North American perpendicular grid pattern,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cuba-junky.com/matanzas/cardenas-home.htm|title = Cardenas Cuba}}</ref> modeled on the city of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], with the help of American (Confederate) landscape engineers. Another notable link between the city and South Carolina was Cárdenas native, [[Ambrosio José Gonzales]], who would spend several years residing there and married Harriet Elliot, daughter of prominent South Carolina planter and state Sen. [[William Elliott (American politician)|William Elliot]], in 1856, living 24 miles from Charleston.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/academic/bhs.htm|title = The role of a Cuban in the Confederacy}}</ref> According to historian Antonio Rafael de la Cova, Gonzales would join the Confederate forces and was nominated for the rank of general six times but was unsuccessful due to a personal feud with [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de la Cova |first1=Antonio Rafael |title=Cuban Confederate Colonel, The Life of Ambrosio José Gonzales |date=22 March 2009 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |isbn=978-1570038440}}</ref>

In 1850, the [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] General [[Narciso López]], along with some Americans and Cuban exiles (including [[Ambrosio José Gonzales|Gonzales]]), landed here on a filibustering expedition, and held the town for a few hours, abandoning it when he saw that the people would not rise to support him in his efforts to secure Cuban independence.<ref name=EB1911/> López did, however, raise for first time the modern [[Flag of Cuba]], designed by him along with a local Cuban [[Miguel Teurbe Tolon]].

In May 1898, during the [[Spanish–American War]], three notable [[Battle of Cárdenas|battles were fought at Cardenas]]. However, credit for the Spanish victories goes mainly to the local Cuban forces, led, among others, by General Carlos M. de Rojas.

In the late 19th century and early 20th Century, Cárdenas was one of the main sugar-exporting towns of Cuba,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cardenas|title = Cárdenas &#124; Cuba &#124; Britannica}}</ref> and had received a great influx of European immigrants, including from [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Corsica]] - many Cárdenas families were known for having foreign-sounding surnames, such as Jones, Larrieu, Smith, Villa-Giorgi and Sterling, among others.

By 1907 the population was 24,280. The shallowness of the harbour required loads to be lightened and repeated loading of cargoes. After the [[1933 Cuba–Brownsville hurricane]] hit the city badly, [[José Arechabala S.A.]] financed the [[dredging]] of the harbour and the reform of the whole coastline, including the construction of the ''Monumento a la Bandera'' (monument to the national Cuban flag).{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} This justified the Arechabala appointment as ''Benefactora eminente'' of Cárdenas.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Inauguración de las Obras del Litoral |journal=Gordejuela |year=1945 |volume=VI |issue=282 |language=es}}</ref>  The surrounding region is farmed for its fertility.

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Cárdenas had a population of 158,322.<ref name="citypopulation">{{Cite web |title=Cuba: Administrative Division (Provinces and Municipalities) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/cuba/admin/ |access-date=2024-02-03 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> With a total area of {{convert|566|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name=statoids>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ycu.html|title=Municipios of Cuba|author=Statoids|date=July 2003| access-date=2007-10-07}}</ref> it has a population density of {{convert|270|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.
