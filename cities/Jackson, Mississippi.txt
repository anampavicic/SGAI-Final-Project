'''Jackson''' is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] of and the [[List of municipalities in Mississippi|most populous]] city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Mississippi]]. Along with [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]], Jackson is one of two county seats for [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]]. The city had a population of 153,701 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], a significant decline from 173,514, or 11.42%, since the  [[2010 United States census|2010 census]], representing the largest decline in population during the decade of any [[Major cities in the U.S.|major U.S. city]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/jacksoncitymississippi/PST045217|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Jackson city, Mississippi|website=Census Bureau QuickFacts|language=en-US|access-date=July 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202181757/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/jacksoncitymississippi/PST045217|archive-date=February 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Jackson is the anchor for the [[Jackson metropolitan area, Mississippi|Jackson metropolitan statistical area]], the largest [[metropolitan area]] located entirely in the state and the tenth-largest urban area in the [[Deep South]].<ref name="metrojacksoneda.com">{{cite web |title=Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas Population Totals and Components of Change: 2010-2019 |url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-metro-and-micro-statistical-areas.html |access-date=May 13, 2020 |archive-date=June 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616024757/https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-metro-and-micro-statistical-areas.html |url-status=live }}</ref> With a 2020 population of nearly 600,000, metropolitan Jackson is home to over one-fifth of Mississippi's population. The city sits on the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] and is located in the greater [[Jackson Prairie]] region of Mississippi. Jackson is the only city in Mississippi with a population exceeding 100,000 people.

Founded in 1821 as new state capital for Mississippi, Jackson is named after General [[Andrew Jackson]], a war hero in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] during the [[War of 1812]] and subsequently the seventh [[President of the United States|U.S. president]]. Following the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], which was fought near Jackson during the [[American Civil War]] in 1863, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces commanded by General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] launched the [[Jackson Expedition|siege of Jackson]] and set the city on fire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jacksonms.gov/visitors/history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510192414/http://www.jacksonms.gov/visitors/history|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2010|title=Official City of Jackson, Mississippi Website - History of Jackson|date=May 10, 2010|access-date=July 4, 2018}}</ref>

During the 1920s, Jackson surpassed [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] to become the most populous city in the state following a speculative [[natural gas]] boom in the region. The current slogan for the city is "The City with Soul".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jacksoncitywithsoul.com/ |title=Jackson, Mississippi &#124; City With Soul |publisher=Jacksoncitywithsoul.com |access-date=January 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204071048/http://www.jacksoncitywithsoul.com/ |archive-date=February 4, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> It has had numerous musicians prominent in [[blues]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[jazz]]. The city is located in the [[Deep South|deep south]] halfway between [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[New Orleans]] on [[Interstate 55]] and [[Dallas]] and [[Atlanta]] on [[Interstate 20]].

The city has a number of museums and cultural institutions, including the [[Mississippi Children's Museum]], [[Mississippi Museum of Natural Science]], [[Mississippi Civil Rights Museum]], [[Mississippi Museum of Art]], [[Old Mississippi State Capitol|Old Capital Museum]], [[Museum of Mississippi History]]. Other notable locations are the [[Mississippi Coliseum]] and the [[Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium]], home of the [[Jackson State Tigers football]] team.

In 2020, the Jackson metropolitan area held a [[GDP]] of 30 billion dollars, accounting for 29% of the state's total GDP of 104.1 billion dollars.

Located on the historic [[Natchez Trace]] trade route, created by Native Americans and used by European American settlers, and on the Pearl River, the city's first European American settler was Louis LeFleur, a [[French-Canadian]] trader. The village became known as [[LeFleur's Bluff]].<ref name="jackhist">{{cite web |url=http://www.jacksonms.gov/visitors/history |title=Official City of Jackson, Mississippi Website – Jackson's History |publisher=Jacksonms.gov |access-date=January 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510192414/http://www.jacksonms.gov/visitors/history |archive-date=May 10, 2010 }}</ref> During the late 18th century and early 19th century, this site had a [[trading post]]. It was connected to markets in [[Tennessee]]. Soldiers returning to Tennessee from the military campaigns near [[New Orleans]] in 1815 built a public road that connected [[Lake Pontchartrain]] in Louisiana to this district.<ref>Izard, E. Ray. (January 30, 1974) "Carroll's Trace took Tennessee Boys Home". Jackson: ''Clarion-Ledger.''</ref> A United States treaty with the Choctaw, the [[Treaty of Doak's Stand]] in 1820, formally opened the area for non-Native American settlers.

LeFleur's Bluff was developed when it was chosen as the site for the new state's [[capital city]]. The [[Mississippi Legislature|Mississippi General Assembly]] decided in 1821 that the state needed a centrally located capital (the legislature was then located in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]). They commissioned [[Thomas Hinds]], James Patton, and William Lattimore to look for a suitable site. The absolute center of the state was a swamp, so the group had to widen their search.

After surveying areas north and east of Jackson, they proceeded southwest along with the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] until they reached LeFleur's Bluff in today's Hinds County.<ref name="jackhist"/> Their report to the General Assembly stated that this location had beautiful and healthful surroundings, good water, abundant timber, navigable waters, and proximity to the [[Natchez Trace]]. The Assembly passed an act on November 28, 1821, authorizing the site as the permanent seat of the government of the state of Mississippi.<ref name="jackhist"/> On the same day, it passed a resolution to instruct the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] delegation to press [[United States Congress|Congress]] for a donation of public lands on the river for improved navigation to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref>'' Laws of the State of Mississippi passed at the 4th session of the general assembly, held in the City of Natchez.''

Davis, ''A Way Through the Wilderness: The Natchez Trace and Civilization of the Southern Frontier'' (New York: Harper Collins, 1995), p. 30</ref>

The capital was named for General [[Andrew Jackson]], to honor his January 1815 victory at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] during the [[War of 1812]]. He was later elected as the seventh [[president of the United States]].

The city of Jackson was originally planned, in April 1822, by [[Peter Aaron Van Dorn]] in a "[[checkerboard]]" pattern advocated by [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref name="ancestrypeter">{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~msclaib3/PeterVanDorn.htm |title=Claiborne County MSGenWeb |work=ancestry.com |access-date=October 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924131833/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~msclaib3/PeterVanDorn.htm |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[City block]]s alternated with parks and other open spaces.

In 1839, the Mississippi Legislature passed the first state law in the U.S. to permit married women to own and administer their own property.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gilmer|first=Robert|date=November 21, 2003|title=Chickasaws, Tribal Laws, and the Mississippi Married Women's Property Act of 1839|url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sr_papers/history_sr/srhistory_2003/gilmer_robert.pdf|access-date=January 23, 2021|website=www.unca.edu|archive-date=April 10, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410070903/http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sr_papers/history_sr/srhistory_2003/gilmer_robert.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jackson was connected by public road to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] in 1826.<ref>Brough, Charles H. (1903) "Historic Clinton". ''Publications of the Mississippi Historical Society''. v. 7, p.285.</ref> Jackson was first connected by railroad to other cities in 1840. An 1844 map shows Jackson linked by an east–west rail line running between Vicksburg, [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]], and [[Brandon, Mississippi|Brandon]]. Unlike Vicksburg, [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], Jackson is not located on the [[Mississippi River]], and it did not develop during the [[antebellum era]] as those cities did from major river commerce. The construction of railroad lines to the city sparked its growth in the decades following the [[American Civil War]].

===American Civil War===
[[File:Jacksonsiege1863.jpg|right|thumb|September 1863 map of the siege of Jackson]]
Despite its small population, during the Civil War, Jackson became a strategic center of manufacturing for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. In 1863, during the military campaign which ended in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|capture of Vicksburg]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces captured Jackson during two battles—once before the fall of Vicksburg and once after the fall of Vicksburg.

On May 13, 1863, Union forces won the first [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Battle of Jackson]], forcing [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces to flee northward towards [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]]. On May 14, Union troops under the command of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] burned and looted key facilities in Jackson, a strategic manufacturing and railroad center for the Confederacy.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Brian|title=[Johnson] When Jackson Burned|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2006/may/17/johnson-when-jackson-burned/|access-date=2021-01-23|website=www.jacksonfreepress.com|language=en|archive-date=November 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112041026/https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2006/may/17/johnson-when-jackson-burned/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Vicksburg|first1=Mailing Address: 3201 Clay Street|last2=Us|first2=MS 39183 Phone:636-0583 Contact|title=Battle of Jackson (May 14) - Vicksburg National Military Park (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/vick/learn/historyculture/jackson.htm|access-date=2021-01-23|website=www.NPS.gov|language=en|archive-date=April 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414202421/https://www.nps.gov/vick/learn/historyculture/jackson.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> After driving the Confederate forces out of Jackson, Union forces turned west and engaged the Vicksburg defenders at the [[Battle of Champion Hill]] in nearby [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards]]. The Union forces began their siege of Vicksburg soon after their victory at Champion Hill. Confederate forces began to reassemble in Jackson in preparation for an attempt to break through the Union lines surrounding Vicksburg and end the siege. The Confederate forces in Jackson built defensive [[fortification]]s encircling the city while preparing to march west to Vicksburg.

Confederate forces marched out of Jackson in early July 1863 to break the siege of Vicksburg. But, unknown to them, Vicksburg had already surrendered on July 4, 1863. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] dispatched General Sherman to meet the Confederate forces heading west from Jackson. Upon learning that Vicksburg had already surrendered, the Confederates retreated into Jackson. Union forces began the [[siege of Jackson]], which lasted for approximately one week. Union forces encircled the city and began an [[artillery]] bombardment. One of the Union artillery emplacements has been preserved on the grounds of the [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]] in Jackson. [[John C. Breckinridge]], former United States [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], served as one of the Confederate generals defending Jackson. On July 16, 1863, Confederate forces slipped out of Jackson during the night and retreated across the Pearl River.

Union forces completely burned the city after its capture this second time. The city was called "Chimneyville" because only the chimneys of houses were left standing.<ref name=":0" /> The northern line of Confederate defenses in Jackson during the siege was located along a road near downtown Jackson, now known as Fortification Street.

Because of the siege and following destruction, few [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] structures have survived in Jackson. The [[Mississippi Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]], built in 1842, served as Sherman's headquarters and has been preserved. Another is the [[Old Mississippi State Capitol|Old Capitol]] building, which served as the home of the Mississippi state legislature from 1839 to 1903. The Mississippi legislature passed the ordinance of [[secession]] from the Union there on January 9, 1861, becoming the second state to secede from the United States. The [[Jackson City Hall]], built in 1846 for less than $8,000, also survived. It is said that Sherman, a [[Freemasonry|Mason]], spared it because it housed a [[Masonic Lodge]], though a more likely reason is that it housed an army hospital.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Bennie Gordon|date=June 19, 2014|title=HONORING THE CITY OF JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/6/20/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e1028-5?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Honoring+the+city+of+jackson%22%5D%7D&s=6&r=1|journal=Congressional Record|volume=160|issue=97|pages=E1029|via=Congress.gov|access-date=January 23, 2021|archive-date=April 10, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410070902/https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/6/20/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e1028-5?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Honoring+the+city+of+jackson%22%5D%7D&s=6&r=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Reconstruction===
During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], African Americans were granted civil rights. Schools were established and African Americans held political offices. [[Eugene Welborne]], [[Charles Reese (politician)|Charles Reese]], [[Weldon Hicks]], and [[George Caldwell Granberry]] were among the legislators who represented Hinds County in the legislature. African Americans also served in local offices, as judges, and as marshalls.

Mississippi had considerable insurgent action, as whites struggled to maintain white supremacy. Jackson's appointed mayor [[Joseph G. Crane]] was stabbed to death in 1869. The assailant, [[Edward M. Yerger]], was arrested by military authorities but, after a U.S. Supreme Court case ([[Ex parte Yerger]]), he was bonded out, moved to Baltimore and was never tried.

The economic recovery from the Civil War was slow through the start of the 20th century, but there were some developments in transportation. In 1871, the city introduced mule-drawn streetcars which ran on State Street, which were replaced by electric ones in 1899.<ref>Todd Sanders, ''Images of America: Jackson's North State Street'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2009), 58 and 40.</ref> In 1875, the [[Red Shirts (United States)|Red Shirts]] were formed, one of the second waves of insurgent [[paramilitary]] organizations that essentially operated as "the military arm of the Democratic Party" to take back political power from the Republicans and to drive black people from the polls ([[Mississippi Plan]]).<ref>George C.

Author [[Eudora Welty]] was born in Jackson in 1909, lived most of her life in the Belhaven section of the city, and died there in 2001. Her [[memoir]] of development as a writer, ''[[One Writer's Beginnings]]'' (1984), presented a picture of the city in the early 20th century. She won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1973 for her novel, ''[[The Optimist's Daughter]],'' and is best known for her novels and short stories. The main library of the [[Jackson/Hinds Library System]] was named in her honor,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vicory|first=Justin|title=Jackson libraries face an existential crisis that includes black mold.

[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], a highly acclaimed African-American author, lived in Jackson as an adolescent and young man in the 1910s and 1920s. He related his experience in his memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945). He described the harsh and largely terror-filled life most African Americans experienced in the South and Northern ghettos such as [[Chicago]] under [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in the early 20th century.

Jackson had significant growth in the early 20th century, which produced dramatic changes in the city's skyline. Jackson's new [[Union Station (Jackson, Mississippi)|Union Station]] downtown reflected the city's service by multiple rail lines, including the [[Illinois Central]].

Across the street, the new, luxurious [[King Edward Hotel (Jackson, Mississippi)|King Edward Hotel]] opened its doors in 1923, having been built according to a design by New Orleans architect [[William T. Nolan]]. It became a center for prestigious events held by Jackson society and Mississippi politicians. Nearby, the 18-story [[Standard Life Building]], designed in 1929 by Claude Lindsley, was the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world upon its completion.

Jackson's economic growth was further stimulated in the 1930s by the discovery of [[natural gas]] fields nearby. Speculators had begun searching for oil and natural gas in Jackson beginning in 1920. The initial drilling attempts came up empty. This failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state's insane asylum to begin a well on its grounds in 1924, where he found natural gas. (Render eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did not have the right to lease the state's property.) Businessmen jumped on the opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area. The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment. By 1930, there were 14 derricks in the Jackson skyline.

Mississippi Governor [[Theodore Bilbo]] stated:{{blockquote|It is no idle dream to prophesy that the state's share [of the oil and natural gas profits] properly safe-guarded would soon pay the state's entire bonded indebtedness and even be great enough to defray all the state's expenses and make our state tax free so long as obligations are concerned.}}

This enthusiasm was subdued when the first wells failed to produce oil of a sufficiently high gravity for commercial success. The barrels of oil had considerable amounts of saltwater, which lessened the quality. The governor's prediction was wrong in hindsight, but the oil and natural gas industry did provide an economic boost for the city and state. The effects of the [[Great Depression]] were mitigated by the industry's success. At its height in 1934, there were 113 producing wells in the state. The overwhelming majority were closed by 1955.<ref>Dudley J. Hughes, ''Oil in the Deep South: A History of the Oil Business in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, 1859–1945'' (Jackson: University of Mississippi Press, 1993), 67–86.</ref>

Due to provisions in the federal [[Rivers and Harbors Act]], on October 25, 1930, city leaders met with U.S. Army engineers to ask for federal help to alleviate Jackson flooding.<ref>River and Harbor Act of 1930, July 3, 1930, ch. 847, 46 Stat. 918.

====Jackson's Gold Coast====
During Mississippi's extended [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] period, from the 1920s until the 1960s, illegal drinking and gambling casinos flourished on the east side of the Pearl River, in [[Flowood, Mississippi|Flowood]] along with the original [[U.S. Route 80]] just across from the city of Jackson. Those illegal casinos, bootleg liquor stores, and nightclubs made up the Gold Coast, a strip of mostly [[black-market]] businesses that operated for decades along Flowood Road. Although outside the law, the Gold Coast was a thriving center of nightlife and music, with many local blues musicians appearing regularly in the clubs.

The Gold Coast declined and businesses disappeared after Mississippi's prohibition laws were repealed in 1966, allowing Hinds County, including Jackson, to go "wet".<ref>[http://blues.goodbarry.com/_webapp_2758974/Gold_Coast "Gold Coast"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711110655/http://blues.goodbarry.com/_webapp_2758974/Gold_Coast |date=July 11, 2011 }}, Blues website</ref> In addition, [[racial integration|integration]] drew off business from establishments that earlier had catered to African Americans, such as the [[Summers Hotel and Subway Lounge|Summers Hotel]]. When it opened in 1943 on Pearl Street, it was one of two hotels in the city that served black clients. For years its Subway Lounge was a prime performance spot for black musicians playing jazz and blues.

====World War II and later development====
During [[World War II]], [[Hawkins Field (airport)|Hawkins Field]] (at that time, also known as the Jackson Army Airbase) the American 21st, 309th, and 310th Bomber Groups that were stationed at the base were re-deployed for combat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patriots without a Country: Dutch Wings over Jackson|first1=Amanda|last1=Lyons|first2=Will|last2=Morgan|url=http://www.mdah.ms.gov/new/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/01_Lyons-Morgan.pdf|date=May 1, 2018|access-date=February 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221071722/http://www.mdah.ms.gov/new/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/01_Lyons-Morgan.pdf|archive-date=December 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following the [[Battle of the Netherlands|German invasion of the Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies]], between 688 and 800 members of the Dutch Airforce escaped to the UK or Australia for training and, out of necessity, were eventually given permission by the United States to make use of Hawkins Field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jackson's Flying Dutchmen: The Significance of the Royal Netherlands Military Flying School|author=Samuel Howard Well|publisher=University of Mississippi|date=August 2018|access-date=February 24, 2020|url=https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&context=masters_theses|archive-date=April 10, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410070902/https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&context=masters_theses|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1949, the poet [[Margaret Walker]] began teaching at [[Jackson State University]], a [[historically black college]]. She taught there until 1979 and founded the university's Center for African-American Studies. Her poetry collection won a [[Yale Younger Poets Prize]]. Her second novel, ''[[Jubilee (novel)|Jubilee]]'' (1966), is considered a major work of African-American literature. She has influenced many younger writers.

===Civil rights movement in Jackson===
The [[civil rights movement]] had been active for decades, particularly mounting legal challenges to Mississippi's constitution and laws that disfranchised black people. Beginning in 1960, Jackson as the state capital became the site for dramatic non-violent protests in a new phase of activism that brought in a wide variety of participants in the performance of mass demonstrations.

In 1960, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Jackson's population as 64.3% white and 35.7% black.<ref name="census1">{{cite web |title=Mississippi – Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 |access-date=May 1, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> At the time, public facilities were segregated and [[Jim Crow]] was in effect. Efforts to [[desegregation in the United States|desegregate]] Jackson facilities began when nine [[Tougaloo College]] students tried to read books in the "white only" public library and were arrested. Founded as a [[historically black college]] (HBCU) by the [[American Missionary Association]] after the Civil War, [[Tougaloo College]] helped organize both black and white students of the region to work together for civil rights. It created partnerships with the neighboring mostly white [[Millsaps College]] to work with student activists. It has been recognized as a site on the "Civil Rights Trail" by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>{{cite news

The mass demonstrations of the 1960s were initiated with the arrival of more than 300 [[Freedom Riders]] on May 24, 1961. They were arrested in Jackson for [[breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] after they disembarked from their interstate buses.

New participants kept joining the movement, as they intended to fill the jails in Jackson with their protest.

In Jackson, shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, [[Medgar Evers]], civil rights activist and leader of the Mississippi chapter of the [[NAACP]], was assassinated by [[Byron De La Beckwith]], a [[white supremacist]] associated with the [[White Citizens' Council]].

During 1963 and 1964, civil rights organizers gathered residents for voter education and [[voter registration]]. Black people had been essentially disfranchised since 1890. In a pilot project in 1963, activists rapidly registered 80,000 voters across the state, demonstrating the desire of African Americans to vote. In 1964 they created the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] as an alternative to the all-white state Democratic Party, and sent an alternate slate of candidates to the national Democratic Party convention in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], New Jersey, that year.

Segregation and the disfranchisement of African Americans gradually ended after the Civil Rights Movement gained Congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965. In June 1966, Jackson was the terminus of the James Meredith March, organized by [[James Meredith]], the first [[African American]] to enroll at the [[University of Mississippi]]. The march, which began in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, was an attempt to garner support for full implementation of civil rights in practice, following the legislation. It was accompanied by a new drive to register African Americans to vote in Mississippi. In this latter goal, it succeeded in registering between 2,500 and 3,000 black Mississippians to vote. The march ended on June 26 after Meredith, who had been wounded by a sniper's bullet earlier on the march, addressed a large rally of some 15,000 people in Jackson.

In September 1967 a [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter bombed the synagogue of the [[Congregation Beth Israel (Jackson, Mississippi)|Beth Israel Congregation]] in Jackson, and in November bombed the house of its rabbi, Dr. [[Congregation Beth Israel (Jackson, Mississippi)#Perry Nussbaum era|Perry Nussbaum]].<ref name="BethIsrael">[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/historyofbethisraeljackson.htm History of Beth Israel, Jackson, Mississippi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005050359/http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/historyofbethisraeljackson.htm |date=October 5, 2007 }}, Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life website, History Department, Digital Archive, Mississippi, Jackson, Beth Israel.

Since the late 20th century, it has developed the largest [[American Jews|Jewish community]] in the state.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/southern-and-jewish/the-disappearing-southern-jew/ Stuart Rockoff, "The Disappearing Southern Jew"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714122844/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/southern-and-jewish/the-disappearing-southern-jew/ |date=July 14, 2015 }}, April 30, 2013, 'Southern and Jewish' blog, at My Jewish Learning (ISTL)</ref>

In 1997, [[Harvey Johnson, Jr.]] was elected as Jackson's first African-American mayor. During his term, he proposed the development of a [[convention center]] to attract more business to the city. In 2004, during his second term, 66 percent of the voters passed a referendum for a tax to build the Convention Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitjackson.com/media-article.php?article_id=52 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221210936/http://www.visitjackson.com/media-article.php?article_id=52 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 21, 2007 |title=Jackson Mississippi Tourism- City of Jackson Travel, MS Vacations, Event Planning |publisher=Visitjackson.com |access-date=January 31, 2010 }}</ref>

Mayor Johnson was replaced by [[Frank Melton]] on July 4, 2005. Melton generated controversy through his unconventional behavior, which included acting as a law enforcement officer. A dramatic spike in crime ensued during his term, despite Melton's efforts to reduce crime. The lack of jobs contributed to climb.<ref>{{cite news

In 2007, [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] sheriff Malcolm McMillin was appointed as the new police chief in Jackson, setting a historic precedent. McMillin was both the [[county sheriff]] and city police chief until 2009, when he stepped down due to disagreements with the mayor. Mayor Frank Melton died in May 2009, and City Councilman Leslie McLemore served as acting mayor of Jackson until July 2009, when former Mayor Harvey Johnson was elected and assumed the position.<ref>{{cite news

On July 1, 2013, [[Chokwe Lumumba]] was sworn into office as mayor of the city. After eight months in office, Lumumba died on February 25, 2014.

For several years, the city water supply failed to meet [[Safe Drinking Water Act#National Primary Drinking Water Regulations|federal drinking water standards]] and was subject to many [[boil water order]]s in 2021 and 2022.

==Geography==
[[File:Jackson Mississippi.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Jackson Mississippi taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]
The city of Jackson is located primarily in northeastern Hinds County.  Jackson also includes around 3,000 acres (12.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in [[Rankin County, Mississippi|Rankin County]] comprising [[Jackson–Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport|Jackson-Medgar Evers International Airport]] and a small portion of [[Madison County, Mississippi|Madison County]]. The [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] forms most of the eastern border of the city. A small portion of the city containing [[Tougaloo College]] is the portion of Jackson that lies in Madison County, bounded on the west by [[Interstate 220 (Mississippi)|Interstate 220]] and on the east by the [[U.S. Route 51]] and [[Interstate 55]]. In the 2010 census, only 622 of the city's residents lived in Madison County,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1590000US2808936000| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001): Jackson city (part), Madison County, Mississippi| work=American Factfinder| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| access-date=August 16, 2017| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213160827/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1590000US2808936000| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> and only 1 lived within the city limits in Rankin County.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1590000US2812136000| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001): Jackson city (part), Rankin County, Mississippi| work=American Factfinder| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| access-date=August 16, 2017| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213160207/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1590000US2812136000| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> The city is bordered to the north by [[Ridgeland, Mississippi|Ridgeland]] in Madison County, to the northeast by [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]] on the Pearl River, to the east by [[Flowood, Mississippi|Flowood]] and [[Richland, Mississippi|Richland]] in Rankin County, to the south by [[Byram, Mississippi|Byram]] in Hinds County, and to the west by [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] in Hinds County.

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Downtown Jackson June 2020.jpg|thumb|324x324px|Downtown Jackson from Mississippi Baptist Hospital in June 2020]]
Downtown Jackson is situated directly on the banks of the Pearl River. The downtown district has direct connections to both Interstate 55 via Pearl Street and Pasagoula Street and Interstate 20 via State Street (US 51). Much of the downtown was constructed before the 1980s and only small additions to the skyline have been made since then.

===Geology===
For the most part, Jackson is built on acidic, variably drained silt loam [[soil]]. [[Loess]] forms the topsoil in western sections, where the Loring soil series is common. The Tippo series, also a silt loam, is found in the central flood plain. Farther east, common soil series include Guyton silt loam, Providence silt loam and Smithdale fine sandy loam.<ref>https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119221418/https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/ |date=November 19, 2021 }} SoilWeb (Jackson MS)</ref>
[[File:Jackson gas wells map.png|thumb|Jackson structure map]]
Jackson sits atop the extinct [[Jackson Volcano]], located {{convert|2900|ft}} underground. It is the only capital city in the United States to have this feature. The buried peak of the volcano is located directly below the [[Mississippi Coliseum]].<ref name="Jackson Volcano">

The artesian groundwater flow is not as extensive in Jackson for this reason. The first large-scale well was drilled in the city in 1896, and the city water supply has relied on surface water resources.<ref>Harvey, E.J. et al. (April 1964). ''Ground-Water Resources of Hinds, Madison, and Rankin Counties, Miss.'' Bulletin 64-1. The state of Mississippi. Board of Water Commissioners. p. 3</ref>

===Climate===
Jackson is located in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''). Rain occurs throughout the year, though the winter and spring are the wettest seasons, while September and October are usually the driest months. Snow is rare, and accumulation very seldom lasts more than a day.<ref name="NCDC" /> Average annual precipitation is {{convert|57.35|in}}, see climate table.<ref>Harvey, E.J. et al. (1964) op cit</ref> Much of Jackson's rainfall occurs during thunderstorms. Thunder is heard on roughly 70 days each year. Jackson lies in a region prone to [[severe thunderstorm]]s which can produce large [[hail]], damaging winds, and [[tornado]]es. Among the most notable tornado events was the F5 [[Candlestick Park tornado]] on March 3, 1966, which destroyed the shopping center of the same name and surrounding businesses and residential areas, killing 19 in South Jackson.

The record low temperature is {{convert|−5|°F|0}}, set on January 27, 1940,<ref name="NOWData Jackson, MS" /> and the record high is {{convert|107|°F|0}}, recorded on September 6&ndash;7, 1925, July 29, 1930, and August 30, 2000.<ref name="NOWData Jackson, MS" />

Jackson remained a small town for much of the 19th century. Before the American Civil War, Jackson's population remained small, particularly in contrast to the river towns along the commerce-laden [[Mississippi River]]. Despite the city's status as the state capital, the 1850 census counted only 1,881 residents, excluding slaves, which were not returned separately.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1850 Census of Population: Mississippi|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1850/1850a/1850a-34.pdf|access-date=2023-03-31|archive-date=March 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230315111457/http://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1850/1850a/1850a-34.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1900 the population of Jackson was still less than 8,000. Although it expanded rapidly, during this period [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] became Mississippi's largest city, based on trade, manufacturing, and access to transportation via railroad and highway.

In the early 20th century, Jackson had its largest rates of growth but ranked second to Meridian in Mississippi. By 1944, Jackson's population had risen to some 70,000 inhabitants, and it became the largest city in the state.  For several decades, Jackson had the most thriving business districts and the largest public school system in Mississippi.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wlbt.com/story/1239828/businesses-leave-downtown-jackson/ | title=Businesses Leave Downtown Jackson | date=April 19, 2003 | access-date=June 26, 2023 | archive-date=June 26, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230626150241/https://www.wlbt.com/story/1239828/businesses-leave-downtown-jackson/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Bisaha |first1=Stephan |last2=Chatlani |first2=Shalina |date=November 13, 2022 |title=After decades of neglect, Jackson's Black business district is coming back to life |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/11/13/1136342601/after-decades-of-neglect-jacksons-black-business-district-is-coming-back-to-life |access-date=2023-08-09 |website=[[NPR]] |archive-date=June 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230626150241/https://www.npr.org/2022/11/13/1136342601/after-decades-of-neglect-jacksons-black-business-district-is-coming-back-to-life |url-status=live }}</ref> It achieved its peak population in the 1980 census of more than 200,000 residents in the city.

=== Crime ===
High criminal activity, particularly the homicide rate, is a major reoccurring issue in the city. Crime has had a negative impact on the city's economy and population. Most parts of Jackson are considered a [[food desert]] because important grocery stores and restaurants have closed down or left the city as theft and other crimes have worsened since 2000.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wapt.com/article/grocery-store-closes-creating-food-desert-in-area-of-jackson/43879499 | title=Grocery store closes, creating food desert in area of Jackson | date=May 13, 2023 | access-date=March 3, 2024 | archive-date=March 3, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240303125258/https://www.wapt.com/article/grocery-store-closes-creating-food-desert-in-area-of-jackson/43879499 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wjtv.com/news/local-news/northside-drive-waffle-house-closes-its-doors/ | title=Northside Drive Waffle House closes its doors | date=September 28, 2023 | access-date=March 3, 2024 | archive-date=March 3, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240303125253/https://www.wjtv.com/news/local-news/northside-drive-waffle-house-closes-its-doors/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VndTSQP9YUY | title=Jackson councilman blames shoplifting for Food Depot closure | website=[[YouTube]] | access-date=March 3, 2024 | archive-date=March 3, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240303125439/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VndTSQP9YUY | url-status=live }}</ref>

Also in 2021, the Jackson Police Department stated that the city had a serious [[street gang]] problem which is a major contributor to violent crimes.

Several gangs from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] have settled in the city and are heavily involved in drug-selling territory wars and many other crimes.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wlbt.com/2021/02/11/so-jackson-has-gang-problem-what-does-that-mean/ | title=So Jackson has a gang problem.
