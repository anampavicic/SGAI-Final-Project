==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Lynn, Massachusetts}}

=== Pre-contact ===
The area that is now known as Lynn was inhabited for thousands of years by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] prior to [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonization]] in the 1600s. At the time of European contact, the area today known as Lynn was primarily inhabited by the [[Naumkeag people]]<ref name="Perley-1912">{{Cite book|last=Perley|first=Sidney|url=http://archive.org/details/indianlandtitles00perl|title=The Indian land titles of Essex County, Massachusetts|date=1912|publisher=Salem, Mass. : Essex Book and Print Club|others=The Library of Congress}}</ref> under the powerful [[sachem]] [[Nanepashemet]] who controlled territory from the [[Mystic River|Mystic]] to the [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] Rivers. Colonists would not establish a legal agreement with the Naumkeag over the use of their land in Lynn until 1686 after a smallpox epidemic in 1633, [[King Philip's War]], and missionary efforts significantly reduced their numbers and confined them to the [[Praying town|Praying Town]] of [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]].<ref name="Perley-1912" />

===17th century===
English colonists settled Lynn not long after the 1607 establishment of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] and the 1620 arrival of the ''[[Mayflower]]'' at [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]].<ref>https://archive.org/details/historyoflynn02lewi History of Lynn (1829). Retrieved on 2016-03-16</ref> European settlement of the area was begun in 1629 by [[Edmund Ingalls]], followed by John Tarbox of [[Lancashire]] in 1631. The area today encompassing Lynn was originally incorporated in 1629 as [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]], the [[Massachusett language|Massachusett]] name for the area. Three years after the settlement in Salem, five families moved onto Naumkeag lands in the interior of Lynn, then known as Saugus, and the Tomlin family constructed a large mill between today's Sluice and Flax Ponds. The mill not only supplied grains and sustenance for the settlers and trade with the Naumkeag people, but was used to create brews and many fermented casks of hops and wines to send back to King George in England.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Lynn takes its name from [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]], in honor of [[Samuel Whiting Jr.|Reverend Samuel Whiting (Senior)]], Lynn's first official minister who arrived from King's Lynn in 1637.<ref name="Whiting_1637">{{cite web |url=http://www.lynnma.gov/about/history.shtml |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF LYNN |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=About Lynn |publisher=City of Lynn |access-date=2021-12-01 |quote=When the first official minister, Samuel Whiting, arrived from King's Lynn, England, the new settlers were so excited that they changed the name of their community to Lynn in 1637 in honor of him. |archive-date=October 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005040951/http://www.lynnma.gov/about/history.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="cihist">[http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/aboutlynn_history.shtml Brief History of Lynn] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829100613/http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/aboutlynn_history.shtml |date=August 29, 2012 }} at City of Lynn website</ref>

A noteworthy early Lynn colonist, Thomas Halsey, left Lynn to settle the East End of Long Island, where he and several others founded the Town of [[Southampton, New York]]. The resulting Halsey House—the oldest extant frame house in New York State (1648)—is now open to the public, under the aegis of the Southampton Colonial Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thomashalseyofhe00hals/thomashalseyofhe00hals_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Thomas Halsey of Hertfordshire, England, and Southampton, Long Island, 1591-1679 : with his American descendants to the eighth and ninth generations"|website=archive.org|year=1895 |access-date=July 4, 2017}}</ref>

As English settlement pushed deeper into Naumkeag territories, [[Virgin soil epidemic|disease]], [[Praying town|missionary efforts]], and loss of access to seasonal hunting, farming, and fishing grounds caused significant disruption to Naumkeag lifeways. In 1675, Naumkeag [[sachem]] [[Wenepoykin]] joined [[Metacomet]] in resisting English colonization in [[King Philip's War]], for which he was enslaved and sent to [[Barbados]].<ref name="Perley-1912" /> In 1686, under pressure to demonstrate legal title for lands they occupied during the administrative restructuring of the [[Dominion of New England]], the selectmen of Lynn and Reading purchased a deed from [[Wenepoykin|Wenopoykin]]'s heirs Kunkshamooshaw and [[Quonopohit]] for 16 pounds of sterling silver,<ref name="Perley-1912" /> though by this time they and most surviving Naumkeag were residents of the [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] Praying Town.

Further European settlement of Lynn led to several independent towns being formed, with [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] created in 1644; [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]] in 1782; [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] in 1815; [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]] in 1852; and [[Nahant, Massachusetts|Nahant]] in 1853. The City of Lynn was incorporated on May 14, 1850.<ref name="Semi-Centennial_Incorporation"/><ref name="cityoflynn.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflynn.net/aboutlynn_history.shtml|title=Brief History of Lynn|website=www.cityoflynn.net|access-date=July 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707163458/http://cityoflynn.net/aboutlynn_history.shtml|archive-date=July 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Colonial Lynn was an early center of tannery and shoe-making, which began in 1635. The boots worn by [[Continental Army]] soldiers during the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] were made in Lynn, and the shoe-making industry drove the city's growth into the early nineteenth century.<ref name=cihist/> This legacy is reflected in the city's seal, which features a colonial boot.<ref>[http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/ City of Lynn] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010723123312/http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/ |date=July 23, 2001 }} official website</ref>

In 1816, a mail stage coach was operating through Lynn. By 1836, 23 stage coaches left the Lynn Hotel for Boston each day. The [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] Line between Salem and East Boston opened on August 28, 1838. This was later merged with the [[Boston and Maine]] Railroad and called the Eastern Division. In 1847 telegraph wires passed through Lynn, but no telegraph service station was built until 1858.<ref>[http://www.usigs.org/library/books/ma/Lynn1890/lynn02Ch2-1814.txt USigs.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040323204254/http://www.usigs.org/library/books/ma/Lynn1890/lynn02Ch2-1814.txt |date=March 23, 2004 }}, History of Lynn Ch2-1814–1864 pub1890.</ref>

Further inland, industrial activity contemporaneously expanded in Lynn. Shoe manufacturers, led by [[Charles A. Coffin]] and Silas Abbott Barton, invested in the early electric industry, specifically in 1883 with [[Elihu Thomson]], [[Edwin J. Houston]], and their [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gifford |first=Jonathan |date=2013-09-15 |title=100 Great Business Leaders: Of the world's most admired companies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSyJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd |pages=34–35 |isbn=9789814484688}}</ref> That company merged with [[Edison Electric Company]] of [[Schenectady, New York]], forming [[General Electric]] in 1892, with the two original GE plants being in Lynn and Schenectady.

Initially the [[General Electric]] plant specialized in arc lights, electric motors, and meters. Later it specialized in aircraft electrical systems and components, and aircraft engines were built in Lynn during WWII. That engine plant evolved into the current jet engine plant during WWII because of research contacts at MIT in Cambridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.massmoments.org/moment-details/g-e-engineers-test-jet-engine.html|title=G.E.

===20th century===
Lynn experienced a wave of immigration during the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Catholic churches catering to the needs of specific language and ethnic groups also testify to the waves of immigrants.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|13.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|10.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|2.7|sqmi|km2}} (19.87%) is water. Lynn is located beside [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the Atlantic Ocean. Lynn's shoreline is divided in half by the town of [[Nahant, Massachusetts|Nahant]], which divides Lynn Harbor to the south from Nahant Bay to the north. The city lies north of the [[Saugus River]], and is also home to several brooks, as well as several ponds, the largest being Breed's Pond and Walden Pond (which has no relation to a [[Walden Pond|similarly named pond]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]). More than one-quarter of the town's land is covered by the [[Lynn Woods Reservation]], which takes up much of the land in the northwestern part of the city. The city is also home to two beaches, Lynn Beach and King's Beach, both of which lie along Nahant Bay, as well as a boat ramp in Lynn Harbor.

Lynn is located in the southern part of Essex County and is {{convert|10|mi|}} northeast of [[Boston]] and {{convert|22|mi|}} west-southwest of [[Cape Ann]]. The city is bordered by Nahant to the southeast, [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]] to the east, [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] to the northeast, [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]] to the north, [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]] to the northwest, [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] to the west and [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] (in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) to the south. Lynn's water rights extend into Nahant Bay and share Lynn Harbor with Nahant. There is no land connection to Revere; the only connection is the General Edwards Bridge across the Pines River. Besides its downtown district, Lynn is also divided into East Lynn and West Lynn, which are further divided into even smaller areas.

Lynn is loosely segmented into the following neighborhoods:

Central:
* Downtown / Business District
* Central Square

West Lynn:
* Pine Hill
* McDonough Sq./ Barry Park
* Tower Hill / Austin Sq.&nbsp;– Saugus River
* The Commons
* The Brickyard
* Walnut St./Lynnhurst
* Veteran's Village

East Lynn:
* Diamond District / Lynn Shore
* Wyoma Sq.
* The Highlands
* The Fay Estates
* Ward 1 / Lynnfield St.
* Goldfish Pond
* The Meadow / Keaney Park

===Climate===
Lynn experiences cold, snowy winters and warm, humid summers. The climate is similar to [[Boston, Massachusetts#Climate|that of Boston]].

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Lynn has either a [[Humid continental climate#Hot summer subtype|hot-summer humid continental climate]] (abbreviated ''Dfa''), or a hot-summer [[Humid subtropical climate|humid sub-tropical climate]] (abbreviated ''Cfa''), depending on the isotherm used.

==Parks and recreation==

Lynn was among the first communities in America to set aside a significant portion of its total land areas for open space—initially to secure a common public wood source. In 1693, Lynn restricted use of areas today encompassed by the [[Lynn Woods Reservation]], and imposed fines for removing young trees. Although this land area was subsequently divided, in 1706, rights of public access were maintained, and, during the 19th century, recreational use of the woods increased.<ref name="nps.gov">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/massachusetts_conservation/lynnwoods.html|title=Lynn Woods Historic District--MA Conservation: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-date=November 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103210405/https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/massachusetts_conservation/lynnwoods.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1850, the first hiking club in New England—the Lynn Exploring Circle—was established. In 1881, a group of Lynn residents organized the Trustees of the Free Public Forest to protect Lynn Woods by acquiring land and gifting it to the City.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTICAAAAYAAJ&q=%22trustees+of+the+free+public+forest%22&pg=RA1-PA10|title=Annual Report of the Park Commissioners of the City of Lynn ...|date=1890|publisher=The Commissioners|language=en|access-date=October 18, 2020|archive-date=February 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230215201536/https://books.google.com/books?id=LTICAAAAYAAJ&q=%22trustees+of+the+free+public+forest%22&pg=RA1-PA10|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] was hired as a design consultant for Lynn Woods, in 1889, whereupon he recommended keeping the land wild, adding only limited public access improvements.<ref name="nps.gov"/>

Lynn Woods was among the natural resources that inspired landscape architect [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] and others to create Boston's [[Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston|Metropolitan Park System]]. In 1893, Eliot noted that Lynn Woods ''"constitute the largest and most interesting, because the wildest, public domain in all New England."''<ref name="nps.gov"/>

Today, Lynn has 49 parks encompassing 1,540 aggregate acres, representing about 22% of the city's total 6,874-acre land area. Consequently, 96% of all Lynn residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park or open space.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parkserve.org/city/id/2537490/|title=ParkServe|website=ParkServe|publisher=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=November 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110005311/https://parkserve.org/city/id/2537490/|archive-date=November 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau Quick Facts|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lynncitymassachusetts/PST045216|website=U.S. Census Bureau Quick Facts|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> The city's parks and open spaces include:

* [[Lynn Woods Reservation]], the largest municipal park in New England, at {{convert|2200|acre|km2}}. The bulk of the Reservation's land area is situated in the City of Lynn, but portions fall within the boundaries of adjoining municipalities.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Lynn has no [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate]] or controlled-access highways, the nearest being [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] in [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] and [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]], and the combined [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] in Lynnfield. (The original design of Interstate 95 called for a route that would have paralleled Route 107 and crossed Lynn—including [[Lynn Woods Reservation|Lynn Woods]]—but the project was cancelled in 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.architects.org/architectureboston/articles/roads-not-taken|title=The Roads Not Taken|website=www.architects.org|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819101744/http://www.architects.org/architectureboston/articles/roads-not-taken|archive-date=August 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-95N_MA/|title=Interstate 95-Massachusetts (North of Boston Section)|website=www.bostonroads.com|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430193259/http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-95N_MA/|url-status=live}}</ref>) However, Massachusetts State [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]], [[Massachusetts Route 107|Route 107]], [[Massachusetts Route 129|Route 129]] and [[Massachusetts Route 129A|Route 129A]] all pass through Lynn. Route 107 passes from southwest to northeast along a relatively straight right-of-way through the city. It shares a {{convert|0.5|mi|}} concurrency with Route 129A, which follows Route 129's old route through the city between its parent route and Route 1A. Route 129 passes from the north of the city before turning south and passing through the downtown area and becoming concurrent with Route 1A for {{convert|1|mi|}}. Route 1A passes from [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] along the western portion of the Lynnway, a divided highway within the city, before passing further inland into [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]]. The Lynnway itself runs along the coastline, leading to a rotary, which links the road to Nahant Road and [[Lynn Shore Drive]], which follows the coast into Swampscott.

Lynn is served by [[Lynn station]] on the [[Newburyport/Rockport Line]] of the [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] system, as well as [[River Works station]] (which is for [[GE Aviation]] employees only). A number of [[Lynn station#Other Lynn stations|other stations]] were open until the mid 20th century. Numerous [[MBTA bus]] routes also connect Lynn with Boston and the neighboring communities. An extension of the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] to downtown Lynn has been proposed, but not funded. A [[MBTA boat#North Shore|ferry service]] to downtown Boston was operated in 2014, 2015, and 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2014/06/04/lynn-boston-ferry-begins-run/RSva0U8tJKMA8SGGQKfubK/story.html |title=Lynn hopes ferry boosts waterfront |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=June 5, 2014 |author=Rosenberg, Steven A. |access-date=August 1, 2014 |archive-date=August 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053700/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2014/06/04/lynn-boston-ferry-begins-run/RSva0U8tJKMA8SGGQKfubK/story.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.itemlive.com/2018/05/10/baker-says-no-ferry/ |title=Baker Says No to Ferry |newspaper=Lynn Daily Item |date=May 10, 2018 |access-date=May 12, 2018 |archive-date=May 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513081827/https://www.itemlive.com/2018/05/10/baker-says-no-ferry/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The nearest airport is Boston's [[Logan International Airport]], about {{convert|5|mi|}} south.
