==History==
{{Main|History of Baden-Württemberg}}

Baden-Württemberg is formed from the historical territories of [[Württemberg]], [[Baden]] and Prussian [[Province of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]].<ref name=Planet>{{Cite book|author=Andrea Schulte-Peevers |author2=Anthony Haywood |author3=Sarah Johnstone |author4=Jeremy Gray |author5=Daniel Robinson |title=Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5t5mZE_s5YC&pg=PA392|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn=978-1-74059-988-7|year=2007|access-date=1 February 2009}}</ref> Baden spans along the flat right bank of the river [[Rhine]] from north-west to the south ([[Lake Constance]]) of the present state, whereas Württemberg and Hohenzollern lay more inland and hillier, including areas such as the [[Swabian Jura]] mountain range. The [[Black Forest]] formed part of the border between Baden and Württemberg.

In 100 AD, the [[Roman Empire]] invaded and occupied Württemberg, constructing a [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]{{Efn|A fortified boundary zone}} along its northern borders. Over the course of the third century AD, the [[Alemanni]] forced the Romans to retreat west beyond the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. In 496 AD the [[Alemanni]] were defeated by a [[Franks|Frankish]] invasion led by [[Clovis I]].

The Holy Roman Empire was later established. The majority of people in this region continued to be Roman Catholics, even after the [[Protestant Reformation]] influenced populations in northern Germany.

In the late 18th and early 19th century, [[Künzelsau]], the capital of the [[Hohenlohe (district)|Hohenlohe district]], became the centre of emigration to the UK of pork butchers and bacon factors. The pioneers noticed a niche for speciality pork products in the rapidly growing English cities, especially those in the industrial centre and North. Many married local women and sent word home that a good living could be made in England; others followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rmford.co.uk/index.htm|title=Home|website=www.rmford.co.uk}}</ref>

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous people emigrated from this primarily rural area to the [[United States]] for economic reasons.

===20th century to present===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of modern-day Baden-Württemberg consisted of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]],{{Efn|Capital: [[Karlsruhe]]}} the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]{{Efn|Capital: [[Stuttgart]]}} and the [[province of Hohenzollern]]{{Efn|Capital: [[Sigmaringen]]}} of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Since 1871, these had been part of the [[German Empire]]. In the aftermath of World War I and as part of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German revolution of 1918]], the monarchs of Baden,{{Efn|The last monarch being [[Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden]]}} Württemberg{{Efn|The last monarch being [[William II of Württemberg]]}} and Prussia{{Efn|The last monarch being the German emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|William II of Prussia]]}} were deposed, and these states became democratic republics: the [[Republic of Baden]], the [[Free People's State of Württemberg]] and the [[Free State of Prussia]].

Following [[Adolf Hitler]] becoming [[chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, the democratic institutions of Baden, Württemberg and Prussia were abolished as part of the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''.

After World War II, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] established three states in the territory of modern-day Baden-Württemberg: (South) [[South Baden|Baden]],{{efn|Consisting of the southern part of Baden. Capital: [[Freiburg]].}} [[Württemberg-Baden]]{{efn|Consisting of the northern parts of Baden and Württemberg. Capital: [[Stuttgart]].}} and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]].{{efn|Consisting of the southern part of Württemberg, and the former Prussian province of Hohenzollern. Capital: [[Tübingen]].}} [[South Baden|Baden]] and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]] were occupied by [[France]], while [[Württemberg-Baden]] was occupied by the [[United States]]. The new artificial borders were a consequence of France requesting its own occupation zone in Germany after World War II, and the Americans' wish to keep the [[Bundesautobahn 8|A8 motorway]], which spans east-west across northern Baden and northern Württemberg, wholly within their occupation zone.

In 1949, each state became a founding member of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany), with Article 118 of the [[German constitution]] providing an accession procedure. On 9 December 1951, [[1951 Baden-Württemberg referendum|a referendum]] was held in Württemberg-Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern and (South) Baden over a possible merger, or the restoration of the former pre-war states.<ref name="Our State" /> There was strong support for the merger in Württemberg and Hohenzollern, but opposition in Baden. While a majority in the historic area of Baden (52%) voted to restore the former pre-war states, the majority of voters overall (69%) voted in favor of a merger.<ref name="Our State" /> Baden-Württemberg officially became a [[states of Germany|state]] on 25 April 1952.<ref name="Our State" />

There were still opponents to the merger of Baden and Württemberg, however. In 1956 the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] decided that the population of Baden should have their say in a separate referendum. The second referendum was delayed, however, and the Federal Constitutional Court decided in 1969 that another referendum should be held by 30 June 1970. The referendum in the historic area of Baden was finally held on 7 June 1970, with 81.9% of the voters voting in favour of the merger of Baden and Württemberg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/unser-land/geschichte/entstehung-des-suedweststaats/|title=Entstehung des Südweststaats|website=Baden-Württemberg.de}}</ref>

==Geography==
Baden-Württemberg shares borders with the German states of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Hesse]], and [[Bavaria]], and also shares borders with [[France]] ([[Alsace]], within the region of [[Grand Est]]), and [[Switzerland]] (cantons of [[Basel-Landschaft]], [[Basel-Stadt]], [[Aargau]], [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]] and [[Thurgau]]).<ref name="Our State"/>

Most of the major cities of Baden-Württemberg straddle the banks of the [[Neckar River]], which has its source in [[Villingen-Schwenningen]] and runs downstream (from southwest to the centre, then northwest) through the state past [[Tübingen]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Heilbronn]], [[Heidelberg]], and [[Mannheim]].

The [[Rhine]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Rhein}}) forms the western border as well as large portions of the southern border. The [[Black Forest]] (Schwarzwald), the central mountain range of the state, rises east of the [[Upper Rhine valley]]. The high plateau of the [[Swabian Alb]], between the Neckar, the Black Forest, and the Danube, is an essential European [[Drainage divide|watershed]]. Baden-Württemberg shares [[Lake Constance]] (Bodensee, also known regionally as the [[Swabia]]n Sea) with Switzerland, Austria and Bavaria, the international borders within its waters not being clearly defined. It shares the foothills of the [[Alps]] (known as the [[Allgäu]]) with Bavaria and the Austrian [[Vorarlberg]], but Baden-Württemberg itself has no mainland border with Austria.

The [[Danube]] is conventionally taken to be formed by the confluence of the two streams [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] just east of [[Donaueschingen]].
The source of the [[Donaubach]], which flows into the Danube, in Donaueschingen is often referred to as the "source of the Danube" (''Donauquelle''). Hydrologically, the source of the Danube is the source of the Breg as the larger of the two formative streams, which rises near [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen]].

The forests in this region are home to common pests such as ''[[Melolontha hippocastani|Melolontha Hippocastrani]]'', that cause damage to the foliage and soil.

==Climate==

Baden-Württemberg is – along with Bavaria – the southernmost part of Germany.

The climate across the states varies. This is mostly due to a high amount of mountains and highlands inside of the state. Most parts in the western parts (Baden) lower than {{convert|500|-|800|m|ft}} enjoy an almost year round mild [[oceanic climate]] (cfb in Köppen classification). The climate in the eastern parts of the state is more continental.<ref>[https://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif Image] vu-wien.ac.at</ref> For instance, winters in the city of Ulm are colder than in Berlin.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.klimadiagramme.de/Deutschland/ulm2.html | title=Das Klima in Ulm }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.klimadiagramme.de/Deutschland/berlin2.html | title=Das Klima in Berlin – Dahlem }}</ref> 
While winters in the warmest areas often lack snow, the [[Black Forest]], [[Swabian Jura|Swabian Alb]] and [[Alps|the Alps]] tend to get snow frequently, especially in areas of high elevation. Summers here have more rain than in the valleys, but winters tend to have more sun.

Due to the differences of the landscapes, average annual temperatures reach from only {{Convert|5|C|F}} in the microclimates of Black Forest and [[Allgäu]] up to {{Convert|13|C|F}} in the Upper Rhine Valley.

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Baden-Württemberg}}
[[File:Landtag Stuttgart.jpg|thumb|Baden-Württemberg state parliament in [[Stuttgart]]]]
The state [[Landtag of Baden-Württemberg|parliament of Baden-Württemberg]] is the ''Landtag'', located in Stuttgart. The state government is currently formed by a [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]]-[[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] coalition as the [[Cabinet Kretschmann III|third cabinet]] of [[Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg|Minister-President]] [[Winfried Kretschmann]] (Greens).

The politics of Baden-Württemberg have traditionally been dominated by the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] (CDU), which had led all but one government since 1952 until 2011. In the ''Landtag'' [[2011 Baden-Württemberg state election|elections held on 27 March 2011]], voters replaced the Christian Democrats and centre-right [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]] (FDP) coalition with an alliance of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD), which secured a four-seat majority in the state parliament. The alliance elected the Greens-led [[first Kretschmann cabinet]] under [[Winfried Kretschmann]] because the Greens had surprisingly won 36 seats, one more than the Social Democrats' 35 seats. In the [[2016 Baden-Württemberg state election|2016 election]], the Greens and their popular Winfried Kretschmann were reelected by the voters and, with their nationwide best result, turned out first place for the first time in any election in German history. However, because of heavy losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens formed a coalition government with the Christian Democrats, the [[second Kretschmann cabinet]]. After the most recent election in 2021, the Greens-CDU coalition was upheld.

Despite this, Baden-Württemberg's economy is dominated by [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small and medium-sized]] enterprises, like [[Mittelstand|most companies in German-speaking countries are]]. Although poor in workable natural resources (formerly lead, zinc, iron, silver, copper, and salts) and still very rural in some areas, the region is heavily industrialised overall. In 2003, there were almost 8,800 manufacturing enterprises with more than 20 employees, but only 384 with more than 500. There are 3,779 companies in Baden-Württemberg corporate family which come to 1000–5000 employees in total.

The latter category accounts for 43% of the 1.2&nbsp;million persons employed in the industry. The ''Mittelstand'' or mid-sized company model is the backbone of the Baden-Württemberg economy.<ref>Cooke, p. 84</ref> Medium-sized businesses and a tradition of branching into different industrial sectors have ensured specialisation over a wide range. A fifth of the "old" Federal Republic's industrial gross value added is generated by Baden-Württemberg. Turnover for manufacturing in 2003 exceeded 240,000&nbsp;million, 43% of which came from exports. The region depends to some extent on global economic developments, though the great adaptability of the region's economy has generally helped it through crises. Half of the employees in the manufacturing industry are in mechanical and electrical engineering and automobile construction. This is also where the largest enterprises are to be found. The importance of the precision mechanics industry also extends beyond the region's borders, as does that of the optical, clock making, toy, metallurgy and electronics industries. The textile industry, which formerly dominated much of the region, has disappeared from Baden-Württemberg. [[Research and development]] (R&D) is funded jointly by the state and industry. In 2001, more than a fifth of the 100,000 or so persons working in R&D in Germany were located in Baden-Württemberg, most of them in the [[Stuttgart]] area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BADEN – WÜRTTEMBERG – Economy|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/de1_eco.htm|work=[[Eurostat]]|date=June 2004|access-date=16 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223024151/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/de1_eco.htm|archive-date=23 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Baden-Württemberg is also the region with the highest GDP of the [[Four Motors for Europe]].

Baden-Württemberg is a popular holiday destination. Main sights include the capital and biggest city, [[Stuttgart]], modern and historical at the same time, with its urban architecture and atmosphere (and famously, its inner-city parks and historic [[Wilhelma]] zoo), its castles (such as [[Castle Solitude]]), its museums as well as a rich cultural programme (theatre, opera) and [[mineral spring]] baths in Bad Cannstatt (also the site of a Roman [[Castra]]); it is the only major city in Germany with vineyards in an urban territory.

The residential (court) towns of [[Ludwigsburg]] and [[Karlsruhe]], the spas and casino of luxurious [[Baden-Baden]], the medieval architecture of [[Ulm]] ([[Ulm Münster]] is the tallest church in the world), the vibrant, young, but traditional university towns of [[Heidelberg]] and [[Tübingen]] with their old castles looking out above the river Neckar, are popular smaller towns. Sites of former monasteries such as the ones on [[Reichenau Island]] and at [[Maulbronn]] (both [[World Heritage Site]]s) as well as [[Bebenhausen Abbey]] are to be found. Baden-Württemberg also boasts rich old [[Free Imperial Cities]] such as [[Biberach an der Riss|Biberach]], [[Esslingen am Neckar]], [[Heilbronn]], [[Ravensburg]], [[Reutlingen]], [[Künzelsau]], [[Schwäbisch Hall]] and [[Aalen]] as well as the southernmost and sunniest city of Germany, [[Freiburg]], close to Alsace and Switzerland, being an ideal base for exploring the heights of the nearby [[Black Forest]] (e.g., for [[skiing]] in winter or for hiking in summer) with its traditional villages and the surrounding wine country of the Rhine Valley of South Baden.<ref name=Planet/>

The countryside of the lush Upper Neckar valley (where [[Rottweil]] is famous for its [[Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht|''Fastnacht'']] carnival) and the pristine [[Danube]] valley [[Swabian Alb]] (with [[Hohenzollern Castle]] and [[Sigmaringen Castle]]), as well as the largely pristine [[Swabian Forest]], the [[Upper Rhine Valley]], and [[Lake Constance]], where all kinds of water sports are popular, with the former Imperial, today border town of [[Konstanz]] (where the [[Council of Constance]] took place), the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] village at [[Unteruhldingen]], the flower island of [[Mainau]], and the hometown of the [[Zeppelin]], [[Friedrichshafen]] a.o., are especially popular for outdoor activities in the summer months.<ref name=Planet/>

In spring and autumn (April/May and September/October), beer festivals (fun fairs) take place at the [[Cannstatter Wasen]] in Stuttgart. The [[Cannstatter Volksfest]], in the autumn, is the second-largest such festival in the world after the Munich [[Oktoberfest]]. In late November and early December [[Christmas market]]s are a tourist magnet in all major towns, the largest being in Stuttgart during the three weeks before Christmas.

The [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]] is a 194&nbsp;km signposted scenic route from [[Mannheim]] via [[Heidelberg]] and [[Wiesloch]] to [[Pforzheim]] and back, which follows the route of the world's first long-distance [[Road trip|journey]] by automobile which [[Bertha Benz]] undertook in August 1888.

Baden-Württemberg also contains [[Europa-Park]] in [[Rust, Baden-Württemberg|Rust]]. The largest [[theme park]] in Germany, and the second most popular theme park in Europe, after [[Disneyland Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Theme Index 2016|url=http://www.aecom.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2016-ThemeMuseum-Index.pdf|website=teaconnect.org|access-date=4 March 2021}}</ref>

Baden-Württemberg is home to some of the oldest, most renowned, and prestigious universities in Germany, such as the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] (founded in 1386, the oldest university within the territory of modern Germany), [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] (founded in 1457), and [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] (founded in 1477). It also contains three of the eleven German ''excellence universities'' (Heidelberg, Tübingen, [[University of Konstanz|Konstanz]] and [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|Karlsruhe]] and formerly, Freiburg ).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-07-30 |title=Germany's top universities |url=https://www.deutschland.de/en/topicknowledgehigher-education-and-research/an-overview-of-universities-of-excellence-in-germany |access-date=2023-07-17 |website=deutschland.de |language=en}}</ref>

Other university towns are [[University of Mannheim|Mannheim]] and [[University of Ulm|Ulm]]. Furthermore, two universities are located in the state capital [[Stuttgart]], the [[University of Hohenheim]], and the [[University of Stuttgart]]. Ludwigsburg is home to the renowned national film school [[Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg]] (Film Academy Baden-Wuerttemberg). The private [[International University in Germany]] was situated in [[Bruchsal]], but closed in 2009. Another private university is located in Friedrichshafen, [[Zeppelin University]].

Furthermore, there are more than a dozen {{lang|de|[[Fachhochschule]]n}}, i.e., universities of applied sciences, as well as ''Pädagogische Hochschulen'', i.e., teacher training colleges, and other institutions of tertiary education in Baden-Württemberg.{{Efn|Among others in Aalen, Biberach an der Riss, Esslingen, Karlsruhe, Ludwigsburg, Nürtingen, Pforzheim, Ravensburg-Weingarten, Reutlingen, several in Stuttgart, Schwäbisch Hall}} [[Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences|Pforzheim University]] is one of the oldest Fachhochschulen in Germany which is renowned and highly ranked for its Engineering and MBA programs.

As part of [[high-speed rail in Germany]], the [[Mannheim–Stuttgart high-speed railway|Mannheim–Stuttgart]] and [[Wendlingen–Ulm high-speed railway|Stuttgart–Ulm]] high-speed lines were built, and the [[Karlsruhe–Basel high-speed railway|Karlsruhe–Basel high-speed line]], paralleling the traditional [[Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basel railway]], is currently under construction. In and around Stuttgart, the old [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|terminal station]] is currently being replaced with an underground through station as part of the controversial [[Stuttgart 21]] project.

Local branch lines of around {{Convert|860|km|mi}}, managed by the state-owned [[SWEG Südwestdeutsche Landesverkehrs-AG|SWEG]] and [[Hohenzollerische Landesbahn]] (HzL), Karlsruhe-owned [[Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft]] (AVG), private [[Württembergische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft|Württembergische Eisenbahn]] (WEG) and other smaller rail infrastructure operators, complete the state's railway infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-03-05 |title=Nichtbundeseigene Eisenbahnen erhalten mehr Fördermittel |url=https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/service/presse/pressemitteilung/pid/nichtbundeseigene-eisenbahnen-erhalten-mehr-foerdermittel |access-date=2023-02-13 |publisher=Ministry for Transport Baden-Württemberg |language=de}}</ref>

[[Passenger train]] services in Baden-Württemberg are operated partly by various subsidiaries of [[Deutsche Bahn]], the national railway operator, such as [[DB Fernverkehr]] with its high-speed [[Intercity Express|ICE]], as well as [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|IC trains]]; and [[DB Regio]], operating some regional train services in the state. Cross-border train services are also provided by [[SNCF|French Railways]]' [[TGV]] trains, as well as by [[Swiss Federal Railways]] and [[ÖBB|Austrian Federal Railways]] (including its [[Nightjet]] night trains).

Since the 1990s, the [[List of regional railway routes in Baden-Württemberg|around 120 individual regional train services]] in Baden-Württemberg have been managed by the state-owned [[Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg]] (NVBW),{{efn|With some exceptions, such as the Stuttgart S-Bahn, which is managed by the [[Verband Region Stuttgart]]; services on a few minor lines managed by the local ''[[#Administration|Landkreise]]''; and formerly also services running without any state subsidies.}} which has started to commercially tender out these train operations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alles rund um die NVBW |url=https://www.nvbw.de/die-nvbw/wir-ueber-uns |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg mbH |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Land organisiert den Schienenpersonennahverkehr |url=https://vm.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/mobilitaet-verkehr/schiene/planung-finanzierung-und-ausschreibungen/planung-und-finanzierung |access-date=2023-02-13 |publisher=Ministry for Transport Baden-Württemberg |language=de}}</ref> DB Regio, SWEG, HzL, AVG and WEG have been joined in operating regional trains by [[Abellio Deutschland|Abellio]], [[Agilis]], [[Bodensee-Oberschwaben-Bahn]], [[Go-Ahead Verkehrsgesellschaft Deutschland|Go-Ahead]], [[Swiss Federal Railways|SBB]], [[Schwäbische Alb-Bahn]] and [[Vias (rail company)|VIAS]], which entered the market.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Eisenbahnverkehrsunternehmen |url=https://www.bwegt.de/bwegt/partner/eisenbahnverkehrsunternehmen |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=bwegt |language=de}}</ref>

Starting in the 1970s, regional rail around major cities has been transformed into high-frequent [[S-Bahn]] networks, currently the following systems exist (partly) in Baden-Württemberg: [[Stuttgart S-Bahn]], [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]], [[Breisgau S-Bahn]] and [[Basel S-Bahn]]. In and around the cities of Karlsruhe and Heilbronn, the [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]] system combines elements of traditional S-Bahns with tram operations within the urban cores ([[tram-train]]s).

Historically, the railway system in Baden-Württemberg was developed at first by the state's predecessors' state railways: the [[Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway]] opened its first railway line between [[Mannheim Hauptbahnhof|Mannheim]] and [[Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof|Heidelberg]] on 12 September 1840; uniquely in Germany, it used a [[5 ft 3 in gauge railways|broad gauge]] of {{Track gauge|1600 mm}} in its early years. In Württemberg, the [[Royal Württemberg State Railways|Royal State Railways]] opened their first line on 22 October 1845 between two present-day suburbs of Stuttgart.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Güll |first=Reinhard |date=2017 |title=Die Eisenbahn im Großherzogtum Baden und im Königreich Württemberg |trans-title=The railway in the Grand Duchy of Baden and the Kingdom of Württemberg |url=https://www.statistik-bw.de/Service/Veroeff/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag17_03_06.pdf |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=Statistisches Monatsheft Baden-Württemberg |publisher=Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg |language=de }}</ref> In 1900, the [[Hohenzollerische Landesbahn]] (HzL) was founded to expand the rail system in the Prussian province, which had previously only been served by short sections of Württemberg lines passing through "foreign" territory. After the construction of the main lines, various private or local government initiatives constructed branch or local railway lines, some of which survive today as AVG, SWEG, [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr|RNV]] or WEG lines. In 1920, the Baden and Württemberg state railways merged with other state railways to form [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]], which was replaced by [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] after World War II. A lot of smaller railway lines, both DB and remaining local or private lines, closed in the decades after World War II, or were at least run-down with minimal service for passengers. Since the 1990s, some of these lines have been revived and revitalised marking good examples for increased ridership through attractive trains and timetables, with some examples being the [[Kraichgau Railway]] (taken over by AVG) and the [[Schönbuch Railway]] (reopened by WEG).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nahverkehr auf der Schiene |url=https://www.allianz-pro-schiene.de/themen/personenverkehr/nahverkehr/ |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=Allianz pro Schiene |language=de-DE}}</ref>

A popular TV programme portraying railways around Germany and the world, ''[[Eisenbahn-Romantik]]'', originates in Baden-Württemberg and is produced by its public broadcaster [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]].

The population of Baden-Württemberg was 10,486,660 in 2014, of which 5,354,105 were female and 5,132,555 male. In 2006, the birth rate of 8.61 per 1000 was almost equal to the death rate of 8.60 per 1000. 14.87 percent of the population was under the age of 15, whereas the proportion of people aged 65 and older was at 18.99 per cent (2008). The [[dependency ratio]]–the ratio of people aged under 15 and over 64 in comparison to the working-age population (aged 15–64)–was 512 per 1000 (2008). In 2018, Baden-Württemberg [[List of German states by Human Development Index|ranked 2]] on the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) among all states in Germany, after [[Hamburg]]. With an average [[life expectancy]] of 79.8 years for men and 84.2 years for women (2017–2019 [[life table]]), Baden-Württemberg [[List of German states by life expectancy|ranks first]] in this category among all states in Germany for both sexes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lebenserwartung nach Bundesländern und Geschlecht 2017/2019|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/820320/umfrage/lebenserwartung-in-bundeslaendern-nach-geschlecht/|access-date=2021-01-05|website=Statista|language=de}}</ref>

Baden-Württemberg has long been a preferred destination of immigrants. {{As of|2013}}, almost 28% of its population had a migration background as defined by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany; this number clearly surpassed the German average of 21% and was higher than in any other German state with the exception of the city states of Hamburg and Bremen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bevölkerung 2013 nach Migrationshintergrund und Ländern|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Bevoelkerung/MigrationIntegration/Migrationshintergrund/Tabellen/MigrationshintergrundLaender.html|publisher= Statistisches Bundesamt|access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref> {{As of|2014}}, 9,355,239 of the population held German citizenship, whereas 1,131,421 were [[Alien (law)|foreign nationals]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Government and organs of state|url=https://www.zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Aktuelles/Ergebnisse/DemografischeGrunddaten.html?nn=3065474|publisher=Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder|access-date=14 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145258/https://www.zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Aktuelles/Ergebnisse/DemografischeGrunddaten.html?nn=3065474|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Northern and most of central Württemberg has been traditionally [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Lutheran]]) since the [[Reformation]] in 1534 (with its centre at the famous [[Tübinger Stift]]). The former [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] (Northwestern Baden) with its capital Heidelberg was shaped by [[Calvinism]] before being integrated into Baden. [[Upper Swabia]], and the Upper Neckar Valley up to the bishop seat of [[Rottenburg am Neckar|Rottenburg]], and Southern Baden (the Catholic archbishop has its seat in [[Freiburg]]) have traditionally been bastions of [[Roman Catholicism]]. Catholics have a very narrow plurality in the state, with 6% of the population adhering to Islam and 24% of the population disclaiming any religion or adhering to other faiths.

=== Sports ===
[[File:Stuttgart stadium.jpg|thumb|200px|[[MHPArena]] in Stuttgart, one of the largest stadiums in Germany]]

==== Football ====
Football is the biggest sport in Baden-Württemberg. Clubs currently competing in the [[Bundesliga]] include [[SC Freiburg]], [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]] and the most successful club in the state, [[VfB Stuttgart]], meanwhile [[Karlsruher SC]], [[1. FC Heidenheim]], [[SV Sandhausen]] and [[SV Waldhof Mannheim|Waldhof Mannheim]] also compete in the top three German soccer divisions.

==== Handball====
[[Handball-Bundesliga]] multiple champions [[Frisch Auf Göppingen]] and [[Rhein-Neckar Löwen]], as well as [[TV Bittenfeld|TVB 1898 Stuttgart]] are based in Baden-Württemberg. Frisch Auf Göppingen won [[Men's EHF Champions League|EHF Champions League]] (Europe's premier club tournament) twice, in [[1959–60 European Cup (handball)|1960]] and [[1961–62 European Cup (handball)|1962]]. Several major women's handball clubs are also based here, including 3-time [[Handball-Bundesliga Frauen|Frauen Bundesliga]] champions [[SG BBM Bietigheim]].

==== Basketball ====
Compared to other German states, Baden-Württemberg has a particularly high density of professional basketball teams such as [[Riesen Ludwigsburg]], [[ratiopharm Ulm]], [[USC Heidelberg]], [[PS Karlsruhe Lions]] and others.

==== Ice hockey ====
One of the most decorated German ice hockey clubs, [[Adler Mannheim]], is based in the city of [[Mannheim]]. Other [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]] clubs, such as [[SC Bietigheim Steelers|Bietigheim Steelers]] and [[Schwenninger Wild Wings]] are also based in the state.

==== Volleyball ====
Baden-Württemberg is home to the most successful club in German volleyball history, the [[Deutsche Volleyball-Bundesliga|Volleyball-Bundesliga]] club [[VfB Friedrichshafen]], which won [[CEV Champions League]] in [[2006–07 CEV Champions League|2006–07]] season.

==== Motorsport ====
There are also multiple motorsport facilities, the most famous one being long-time [[F1|Formula One]] [[List of Formula One circuits|circuit]] [[Hockenheimring]].

=== Dialects ===
Two dialect groups of German are spoken in Baden-Württemberg in various variants: [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] and [[Franconian (linguistics)|Franconian]] dialects. In central and southern Württemberg, the Alemannic dialect of [[Swabian Jura|Swabian]] is spoken (slightly differing even within the area, e.g., between [[Upper Swabia]], the [[Swabian Jura|Swabian Alb]], and the central [[Neckar]] Valley of the Stuttgart region). In [[South Baden]], the local dialects are [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] and [[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] (i.e., variants of what is also [[Swiss German]]). In the northern part of Baden, i.e., the area around [[Karlsruhe]], [[Heilbronn]] and [[Mosbach]], [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects are predominant. In the ''[[Electoral Palatinate|Kurpfalz]]'', however, with the cities of [[Heidelberg]] and [[Mannheim]], the idiom is [[Rhenish Franconian languages|Rhine Franconian]] (i.e., [[Palatine German language|Palatinate German]]), while in the Northeast of Baden-Württemberg [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]] is spoken.

The same or similar Alemannic dialects are also spoken in the neighboring regions, especially in [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Bavarian Swabia]], Alsace ([[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]]), German-speaking Switzerland (Swiss German), and the Austrian [[Vorarlberg]]. In contrast, the other Franconian dialects range from the Netherlands over the [[Rhineland]], [[Lorraine]], and [[Hesse]] up to [[Franconia]] in northern [[Bavaria]].

[[Yiddish]] and [[Rotwelsch|Pleißne]] were spoken while [[Romani language|Romani]] is still being used by some.<ref name="Grab von Josef Reinhard">(Stopper): ''[http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.burladingen-grab-von-josef-reinhard-ist-denkmal.f5a3abad-bec8-462d-8e38-f37d9ef0a150.html Grab Josef Reinhard.]'' In: ''[[Schwarzwälder Bote]]'' vom 28.

A variant of the Alemannic German of Baden developed into the [[Colonia Tovar dialect]], spoken by descendants of immigrants from Baden who went to [[Venezuela]] in 1843.
