'''Salt Lake City''', often shortened to '''Salt Lake''' or '''SLC''', is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] and [[List of cities and towns in Utah|most populous city]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Utah]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]], the most populous county in the state. The city is the core of the Salt Lake City [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which had a population of 1,257,936 at the 2020 census. Salt Lake City is further situated within a larger metropolis known as the [[Salt Lake City–Provo–Orem Combined Statistical Area|Salt Lake City–Ogden–Provo Combined Statistical Area]], a corridor of contiguous urban and suburban development stretched along a {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of the [[Wasatch Front]], comprising a population of 2,746,164 (as of 2021 estimates),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-metro-and-micro-statistical-areas.html|title=Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas Population Totals: 2010–2018|access-date=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602005545/https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-metro-and-micro-statistical-areas.html|archive-date=June 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> making it the 22nd largest in the nation.  With a population of 200,133 in 2020, it is the [[List of United States cities by population|117th most populous city in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Division |first=U.S. Census Bureau, Data Integration |title=City and Town Population Totals: 2010–2018 |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/saltlakecitycityutah,US/PST045219 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524221221/https://census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-cities-and-towns.html |archive-date=May 24, 2019 |access-date=October 6, 2019 |website=census.gov}}</ref>  It is also the central core of the larger of only two major urban areas located within the [[Great Basin]] (the other being [[Reno, Nevada]]).

Salt Lake City was founded on July 24, 1847, by early pioneer settlers led by [[Brigham Young]] who were seeking to escape persecution they had experienced while living farther east. The [[Mormon pioneers]], as they would come to be known, entered a semi-arid valley and immediately began planning and building an extensive irrigation network which could feed the population and foster future growth. Salt Lake City's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan, with the southeast corner of [[Temple Square]] (the area containing the [[Salt Lake Temple]] in downtown Salt Lake City) serving as the origin of the [[Salt Lake meridian]]. Owing to its proximity to the [[Great Salt Lake]], the city was originally named Great Salt Lake City. In 1868, the word "Great" was dropped from the city's name.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Cott|first=John W.|title=Utah place names: a comprehensive guide to the origins of geographic names: a compilation|publisher=[[University of Utah Press]]|year=1990|isbn=978-0-87480-345-7|page=327|id=Accessed July 25, 2011}}</ref> Immigration of international members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[Mining|mining booms]], and the construction of the [[first transcontinental railroad]] brought economic growth, and the city was nicknamed "The Crossroads of the West". It was traversed by the [[Lincoln Highway]], the first transcontinental highway, in 1913. Two major cross-country freeways, [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] and [[Interstate 80 in Utah|I-80]], now intersect in the city. The city also has a [[belt highway|belt route]], I-215.

Salt Lake City has developed a strong tourist industry based primarily on [[skiing]], [[outdoor recreation]], and [[religious tourism]]. It hosted the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] and will host the [[2034 Winter Olympics]]. It is known for its [[Modern liberalism in the United States|politically liberal]] culture, which stands in contrast with most of the rest of the state's highly [[Conservatism|conservative]] leanings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salt Lake City: An island of liberal blue in a sea of conservative red|url=https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/18103-salt-lake-city-an-island-of-liberal-blue-in-a-sea-of-conservative-red|access-date=October 29, 2020|website=utahpolicy.com|date=October 15, 2018|language=en-gb}}</ref> It is home to a significant [[LGBT community]] and hosts the annual [[Utah Pride Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Survey ranks Salt Lake City's LGBT population 7th among top 50 metro areas|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2315479&itype=CMSID|access-date=August 2, 2021|website=The Salt Lake Tribune|language=en-US}}</ref> It is the [[industrial loan company|industrial banking]] center of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/sisum04/industrial_loans.html|title=FDIC Industrial Banks|publisher=[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]|date=June 25, 2004|access-date=March 6, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702194834/http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/sisum04/industrial_loans.html|archive-date=July 2, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Salt Lake City and the surrounding area are also the location of several institutions of higher education including the state's flagship research school, the [[University of Utah]].

Sustained [[drought]] in Utah has strained Salt Lake City's [[water security]], caused the Great Salt Lake level to drop to record low levels,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slc.gov/mayor/drought/ |title= Drought 2022|website=www.slc.gov |access-date=April 16, 2022}}{{title missing|date=May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Great Salt Lake Reaches New Historic Low |url=https://www.usgs.gov/news/great-salt-lake-reaches-new-historic-low |website=USGS |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |access-date=April 16, 2022}}</ref> and has impacted the local and state economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.utahbusiness.com/if-we-want-growth-we-need-water-solutions/ |title= If we want growth, we need water solutions|website=www.utahbusiness.com |date= May 11, 2022|access-date=July 13, 2022}}{{title missing|date=September 2022}}</ref> The receding lake has exposed [[arsenic]] which may become airborne, exposing area residents to poisonous dust.<ref name=Flavelle2022/> The city is also under threat of major earthquake damage amplified by two offshoots of the nearby [[Wasatch Fault]] that join underneath the downtown area.<ref name=USGS2021/>

The settling of Salt Lake City dates to the arrival of the Latter-day Saints in July 1847,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Thomas G.|last2=Allen|first2=James B.|title=Mormons & Gentiles: A History of Salt Lake City|date=1984|publisher=Pruett Publishing Company|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=0-87108-664-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/mormonsgentilesh00alex/page/24 24]|edition=First|quote=By the time Brigham Young caught his first glimpse of the valley...Salt Lake City was already begun.

Upon arrival at the Salt Lake Valley, [[President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|president]] of the church [[Brigham Young]] is recorded as stating, "This is the right place, drive on." Brigham Young is said to have seen the area in a [[Vision (religion)|vision]] before the wagon train's arrival. They found the broad valley empty of any human settlement.

Four days after arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young designated the building site for the Salt Lake Temple. The Salt Lake Temple, constructed on the block later called Temple Square, took 40 years to complete. Construction started in 1853, and the temple was dedicated on April 6, 1893. The temple has become an icon for the city and serves as its centerpiece. The southeast corner of Temple Square is the point of reference for the [[Salt Lake meridian]], and for all addresses in the Salt Lake Valley.

The pioneers organized a state called [[State of Deseret]], and petitioned for its recognition in 1849. The [[United States Congress]] rebuffed the settlers in 1850 and established the [[Utah Territory]], vastly reducing its size, and designated Fillmore as its capital city. Great Salt Lake City replaced [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]] as the territorial capital in 1856, and the name later was shortened to Salt Lake City. The city's population continued to swell with an influx of converts to the LDS Church and [[Gold Rush]] gold seekers, making it one of the most populous cities in the [[American Old West]].

The first group of settlers brought African slaves with them, making Utah the only place in the western United States to have African slavery.<ref>''Negro Slaves in Utah'' by Jack Beller, Utah Historical Quarterly, vol. 2, no. 4, 1929, pp. 124–126</ref> Three slaves, Green Flake, Hark Lay, and Oscar Crosby, came west with the first group of settlers in 1847.<ref>{{cite news |title=Slavery in Utah Involved Blacks, Whites, Indians, and Mexicans. |url=https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=419212&q=Blacks+in+Utah+History+An+Unknown+Legacy |access-date=May 6, 2020 |work=The History Blazer |issue=April 1995 |publisher=Utah State Historical Society}}</ref> The settlers also began to purchase Indian slaves in the well-established Indian slave trade,<ref name=knack>{{cite book|title=Boundaries Between: The Southern Paiutes, 1775–1995|author=Martha C.

Explorer, ethnologist, and author [[Richard Francis Burton]] traveled by coach in the summer of 1860 to document life in Great Salt Lake City. He was granted unprecedented access during his three-week visit, including audiences with Brigham Young and other contemporaries of Joseph Smith. The records of his visit include sketches of early city buildings, a description of local geography and agriculture, commentary on its politics and social order, essays, speeches, and sermons from Young, Isaac Morley, George Washington Bradley and other leaders, and snippets of everyday life such as newspaper clippings and the menu from a high-society ball.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard Francis|title=The City of the Saints: Across the Rocky Mountains to California|url=https://archive.org/details/cityofsaintsacro00burt|publisher=Harper & brothers (reprinted by [[University of Michigan Library]])|location=New York City|year=1862|id=Accessed September 13, 2006}}</ref>

Disputes with the federal government ensued over the church's practice of [[polygamy]]. A climax occurred in 1857 when President [[James Buchanan]] declared the area in rebellion after Brigham Young refused to step down as governor, beginning the [[Utah War]]. A division of the [[United States Army]], commanded by [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], later a general in the army of the Confederate States of America, marched through the city and found it had been evacuated. They continued their march through the deserted city to vacant land at the southwest corner of the valley. There they set up [[Camp Floyd]] ({{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} south of the city). Another military installation, [[Fort Douglas]], was established in 1862 to maintain [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] allegiance during the [[American Civil War]]. Many area leaders were incarcerated at the [[Sugar House Prison (Utah)|territorial prison]] in [[Sugar House (Salt Lake City)|Sugar House]] in the 1880s for violation of anti-polygamy laws. The church began its eventual abandonment of polygamy in 1890, releasing [[1890 Manifesto|"The Manifesto"]], which officially suggested members obey the law of the land (which was equivalent to forbidding new polygamous marriages inside the US and its territories, but not in church member settlements in Canada and Mexico). This paved the way for statehood in 1896, when Salt Lake City became the state capital.

The First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 at [[Promontory Summit]]{{efn|Not to be confused with [[Promontory Point, Utah|Promontory Point]], a ghost town.}} on the north side of the Great Salt Lake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/|title=Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails", May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point UT|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=May 10, 1869|access-date=July 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018052635/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/|archive-date=October 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A railroad was connected to the city from the Transcontinental Railroad in 1870, making travel less burdensome. Mass migration of different groups followed. Ethnic Chinese (who had laid most of the Central Pacific railway) established a flourishing Chinatown in Salt Lake City nicknamed "Plum Alley", which housed around 1,800 Chinese during the early 20th century. The Chinese businesses and residences were demolished in 1952 although a historical marker has been erected near the parking ramp which has replaced Plum Alley. Immigrants also found economic opportunities in the booming [[mining|mining industries]]. Remnants of a once-thriving Japantown – namely a Buddhist temple and Japanese Christian chapel – remain in downtown Salt Lake City. European ethnic groups and East Coast missionary groups constructed [[St. Mark's Cathedral, Salt Lake City|St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral]] in 1874, [[B'nai Israel Temple (Salt Lake City)|B'nai Israel Temple]] in 1890, the [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholic]] [[Cathedral of the Madeleine]] in 1909 and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Salt Lake City|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] in 1923. This time period also saw the creation of Salt Lake City's now defunct [[red-light district]] that employed 300 [[prostitution|courtesans]] at its height before being closed in 1911.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stilltoe|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Sillitoe|title=A History of Salt Lake County|page=138}}</ref>

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an extensive [[streetcar]] system was constructed throughout the city, with the first streetcar running in 1872 and electrification of the system in 1889. As in the rest of the country, the automobile usurped the streetcar, and the last trolley was approved for conversion in 1941, yet ran until 1945, due to [[World War II]]. Trolley buses ran until 1946.

The city's population began to stagnate during the 20th century as population growth shifted to suburban areas north and south of the city. Few of these areas were annexed to the city, while nearby towns incorporated and expanded. As a result, the population of the surrounding metropolitan area greatly outnumbers Salt Lake City. A major concern of recent government officials has been combating inner-city commercial decay. The city lost population from the 1960s through the 1980s, but experienced some recovery in the 1990s. Presently, the city has gained an estimated 5 percent of its population since the year 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2013/SUB-EST2013-3.html|publisher=US Census Bureau|access-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522161634/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2013/SUB-EST2013-3.html|archive-date=May 22, 2014}}</ref>

Salt Lake City was selected in 1995 to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. The games were plagued with controversy. A [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bid scandal]] surfaced in 1998 alleging bribes had been offered to secure the bid.

The city is in the northeast corner of the [[Salt Lake Valley]] surrounded by the Great Salt Lake to the northwest, the steep [[Wasatch Range]] to the east, and [[Oquirrh Mountains]] to the west. Its encircling mountains contain several narrow canyons, including [[City Creek (Utah)|City Creek]], [[Emigration Canyon, Utah|Emigration]], [[Millcreek Canyon|Millcreek]], and [[Parley's Canyon|Parley's]] which border the eastern city limits.

The burgeoning population of Salt Lake City and the surrounding metropolitan area, combined with its geographical situation, has led to [[air quality]] becoming a concern. The [[Great Basin]] is subject to strong temperature inversions during the winter, which trap pollutants and decrease the air quality. The Utah Division of Air Quality monitors air quality and issues alerts for voluntary and mandatory actions when pollution exceeds federal safety standards.

===Layout===
[[File:Platslc.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plat]] of Salt Lake City, circa 1870s]]
The city, as well as the [[Salt Lake County, Utah|county]], is laid out on a [[grid plan]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Husarik|first=Theresa|url=http://saltlakecity.about.com/library/weekly/98art/aa031698.htm|title=Navigating Utah's Streets|publisher=About.com|access-date=March 11, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101162355/http://saltlakecity.about.com/library/weekly/98art/aa031698.htm|archive-date=January 1, 2007}}</ref> Most major streets run very north–south and east–west. The grid's origin is the southeast corner of Temple Square, the block containing the Salt Lake Temple; the north–south axis is Main Street; and the east–west axis is South Temple Street. Addresses are [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] within the system (similar to [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]). Odd and even address numbering depends on the quadrant of the grid in which an address is located. The rule is: When traveling away from the grid center (Temple Square) or its axes (Main Street, South Temple Street), odd numbers will be on the left side of the street.

A common explanation for the unusually wide streets of Salt Lake City is that Brigham Young wanted a wagon with a team of oxen to be able to turn around.<ref>[https://therightplace.pro/wide-streets-salt-lake/ Why are Salt Lake City’s streets so wide?]</ref> However, Young was never recorded giving this directive. Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, planned the layout in the "[[Plat of Zion|Plat of the City of Zion]]" (intended as a template for Mormon towns wherever they might be built). This plan included streets {{cvt|132|ft}} wide,<ref>[https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revised-plat-of-the-city-of-zion-circa-early-august-1833/1#historical-intro Revised Plat of the City of Zion, circa Early August 1833 - Historical Introduction]</ref> and may be the source of the unusual width.<ref>[https://therightplace.pro/plat-of-zion/ The Plat of Zion and the Wide Streets of Salt Lake City]</ref> These wide streets and grid pattern are typical of other Mormon towns of the pioneer era throughout the West.

Though the nomenclature may initially confuse new arrivals and visitors, most consider the grid system an aid to navigation. Some streets have names, such as State Street, which would otherwise be known as 100 East. Other streets have honorary names, such as the western portion of 300 South, named "Adam Galvez Street" (for a local Marine corporal killed in action) or others honoring [[Rosa Parks]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[César Chávez]], [[Harvey Milk]], and [[John Stockton]]. These honorary names appear only on street signs and cannot be used in postal addresses.
[[File:Salt Palace (43837757942).jpg|thumb|The [[Salt Palace]] Convention Center]]
In the [[The Avenues, Salt Lake City|Avenues neighborhood]], north–south streets are given letters of the alphabet, and east–west streets are numbered in {{convert|2.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} blocks, smaller than those in the rest of the city.

Smith's Plat of Zion specified the city was to be developed into 135 {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} lots. 
However, the blocks in Salt Lake City became irregular during the late 19th century when [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] lost authority over growth and before the adoption of zoning ordinances in the 1920s. The original {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} blocks allowed for large garden plots, and many were supplied with irrigation water from ditches that ran approximately where modern curbs and gutters would be laid. The original water supply was from [[City Creek (Salt Lake County, Utah)|City Creek]]. Subsequent development of water resources was from successively more southern streams flowing from the mountains east of the city. Some old irrigation ditches are still visible in the eastern suburbs, or are still marked on maps, years after they were gone. There are still some canals that deliver water as required by water rights. Many lots, in Salt Lake City and surrounding areas, have irrigation water rights attached to them. Local water systems, in particular Salt Lake City Public Utilities, have a tendency to acquire or trade for these water rights. These can then be traded for culinary water rights to water imported into the valley. At its peak, irrigation in the valley comprised over one hundred distinct canal systems, many originating at the Jordan Narrows at the south end of the valley. Water and water rights were important in the 19th and early 20th centuries. As heavy agricultural usage changed into a more urban and suburban pattern, canal water companies were gradually replaced by culinary water systems.

Downtown Salt Lake City has been a hub of commerce for the [[Intermountain West]] and its architecture reflects this history. [[Main Street (Greater Salt Lake City)|Main Street]], which was the primary commercial avenue for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, anchors the historic core of the downtown area that begins at the [[Salt Lake Temple]] and concludes at the [[Salt Lake City and County Building|City and County Building]]. Halfway between those two structures, the [[Walker Center]], at the corner of Main and 200 South, was built in 1912 and was the tallest building between [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]] upon its completion.

After a period of stagnation in the era of [[urban sprawl]], and with the construction of [[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX]] in the late 1990s and the [[City Creek Center]] in the early 2010s, downtown Salt Lake City is experiencing a period of revival.

Regent Street, which in the early 20th century was the city's [[red-light district]], has recently been redeveloped with the notable additions of the 2,468-seat [[Eccles Theater]] and 111 Main, an adjacent 24-story office building.

A distinctive feature of Salt Lake City's cityscape is its very large block sizes, which are 660 feet square and separated by streets 132 feet wide, making them the largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plat of Zion|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/plat-of-zion/|access-date=June 7, 2021|website=99% Invisible|date=December 12, 2016 |language=en-US}}</ref> This and the resulting development patterns gives the city and its buildings a unique sense of scale but also a distinct challenge to urban [[walkability]], with many streets boasting six lanes for automobile traffic. On the other hand, the extra-wide streets have made the addition of dedicated transit lanes and light rail more feasible and many streets are now being redesigned with features such as protected bike lanes, linear parks, and even spaces for urban development within the medians.<ref>{{cite web|title=4 Ways Utah is Dealing with Overly-Wide Streets|url=https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/2/1/4-ways-utah-is-dealing-with-overly-wide-streets|access-date=June 7, 2021|website=Strong Towns|date=February 2, 2016 |language=en-US}}</ref> The city also encourages new projects to incorporate mid-block walkways and other scale-mitigation strategies into planning to promote pedestrian engagement.<ref>{{cite web|title=SALT LAKE CITY DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR MID-BLOCK WALKWAYS|url=http://www.slcdocs.com/Planning/Applications/MWDG.pdf|access-date=June 7, 2021}}</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|List of Salt Lake City neighborhoods|Buildings and sites of Salt Lake City, Utah#Neighborhoods and areas}}
Salt Lake City has many distinct neighborhoods. There is a general east–west socioeconomic divide. The eastern neighborhoods of the city, such as [[The Avenues, Salt Lake City|the Avenues]], [[9th and 9th, Salt Lake City|9th & 9th]], [[Yalecrest]], [[Federal Heights, Salt Lake City|Federal Heights]], and [[Sugar House, Salt Lake City|Sugar House]] tend to be more affluent. These districts are popular with professionals, families, and students due to their proximity to Downtown, the [[University of Utah]], commercial precincts, and the Wasatch foothills. The western neighborhoods of the city, such as [[Poplar Grove, Salt Lake City|Poplar Grove]], [[Rose Park, Salt Lake City|Rose Park]], and [[Glendale, Salt Lake City|Glendale]] tend to be more working-class and ethnically diverse and are popular with immigrants and young people.

This divide is a result of the railroad being built in the western half as well as panoramic views from inclined ground in the eastern portion. Housing is more economically diverse on the west side, which results in [[demographics|demographic]] differences. [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]] was also built in a north–south line, further dividing east and west sides of the city.

[[File:Sugarhouseslc.jpg|thumb|Sugar House]]
[[Sugar House, Salt Lake City|Sugar House]], in southeastern Salt Lake City, has a reputation as an older neighborhood with small shops in the center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.10best.com/destinations/utah/salt-lake-city/sugarhouse/|title=Find the Best Things to Do in Sugarhouse|last=Balaz|first=Christine|website=10 Best|access-date=May 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514012213/http://www.10best.com/destinations/utah/salt-lake-city/sugarhouse/|archive-date=May 14, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Sugar House is an area which has been the focus of redevelopment efforts such as the [[S Line (Utah Transit Authority)|UTA S-Line Streetcar]]. In late 2015 there were approximately 900 apartment units either recently built or under construction in the Sugar House area, with an additional 492 units proposed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smart|first=Christopher|date=October 29, 2015|title=Sugar House apartment project would bring impacts — not impact fees|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3106900&itype=CMSID|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610142354/http://www.sltrib.com/home/3106900-155/sugar-house-apartment-project-would-bring|archive-date=June 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Northeast of Downtown is The Avenues, a neighborhood outside of the regular grid system on smaller blocks. The area between 6th Avenue to South Temple Street is a Historical District that is nearly entirely residential, and contains many historical Victorian era homes. Recently the Avenues is becoming known for restaurants and shops opening in old retail space mixed within the community. The Avenues are situated on the upward-sloping bench in the foothills of the Wasatch Range, with the earlier built homes in the lower elevation. The Avenues, along with [[Federal Heights, Salt Lake City, Utah|Federal Heights]], just to the east and north of the [[University of Utah]], and the [[Foothill, Salt Lake City, Utah|Foothill]] area, south of the university, contain gated communities, large, multimillion-dollar houses, and panoramic views of the valley. Many consider this some of the most desirable real estate in the valley.

In addition to larger centers like Sugar House and Downtown, Salt Lake City contains several smaller neighborhoods, each named after the closest major intersection. Two examples are the [[9th and 9th]] (at the intersection of 900 East and 900 South Streets) and 15th & 15th (at the intersection of 1500 East and 1500 South Streets) neighborhoods. These areas are home to foot-traffic friendly, amenities-based businesses such as art galleries, clothing retail, salons, restaurants and coffee shops. During the summer of 2007, 9th and 9th saw sidewalk and street improvements as well as an art installation by Troy Pillow of Seattle, Washington inspired by the 9 Muses of Greek myth, thanks in part to a monetary grant from Salt Lake City.

Many of the homes in the valley date from pre–World War II times, and only a select few areas, such as Federal Heights and the East Bench, as well as the far west side, including parts of Rose Park and Glendale, have seen new home construction since the 1970s.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Salt Lake City}}
[[File:Köppen Climate Types Utah.png|thumb|right|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Utah]]
Salt Lake City has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dsa''), while western parts may experience a [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa''), as summers are dry and hot and winters are cold and wet, but rarely frigid. Late summer and early fall monsoonal activity can keep precipitation fairly consistent throughout the year aside from early to mid summer when rain is minimal. The temperature of the Salt Lake City area is mediated by its unique geography, generally keeping highs and lows from reaching extremes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/region/923/|title=Climate Utah: Temperature, Climograph, Climate table for Utah - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=November 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520135210/https://en.climate-data.org/region/923/|archive-date=May 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The primary source of precipitation in Salt Lake City is massive storms that move in from the [[Pacific Ocean]] along the [[jet stream]] from October to May. In mid-to-late summer, when the jet stream retreats far to the north, precipitation mainly comes from afternoon [[thunderstorm]]s caused by [[North American Monsoon|monsoon]] moisture moving up from the [[Gulf of California]]. Although rainfall can be heavy, these storms are usually scattered in coverage and rarely severe. However, downtown was hit by an [[Fujita scale|F2]] [[Salt Lake City Tornado|tornado]] on August 11, 1999, killing 1 person, injuring 60, and causing $170&nbsp;million in damage. The remnants of [[tropical cyclone]]s from the East Pacific can rarely reach the city during Fall. The remnants of [[Hurricane Olivia (1982)|Hurricane Olivia]] helped bring the record monthly precipitation of {{convert|7.04|in|mm|0}} in September 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/olivia1982.html|title=Remnants of Hurricane Olivia – September 23–28, 1982|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|access-date=April 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513124725/http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/olivia1982.html|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/slc/climate/slcclimate/SLC/table32.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050130075216/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/slc/climate/slcclimate/SLC/table32.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 30, 2005|title=NWS Salt Lake City – Record high and low precipitation for each month|publisher=[[National Weather Service]]|access-date=March 11, 2007}}</ref> 1983 was the wettest year on record, with {{convert|24.26|in|mm|0}}, while 1979 was the driest, when {{convert|8.70|in|mm|0}} were recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/slc/climate/slcclimate/SLC/table29.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050130075208/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/slc/climate/slcclimate/SLC/table29.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 30, 2005|title=NWS Salt Lake City – Maximum and Minimum Calendar Year Precipitation|publisher=NWS|access-date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> Spring [[snowmelt]] from the surrounding mountains can cause localized stream flooding during late spring and early summer, the worst examples being in 1952 and especially 1983, when City Creek burst its banks, forcing city engineers to convert several downtown streets into waterways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=51720845&itype=CMSID|title=Utah snowpack, weather revive memories of '83 floods|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|first=Christopher|last=Smart|date=May 4, 2011|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221505/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/51720845-78/1983-creek-flooding-lake.html.csp|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The nearby Great Salt Lake is a significant contributor to precipitation in the city. The lake effect can enhance rain from summer thunderstorms and produces [[lake-effect snow]] approximately 6 to 8 times per year, some of which can produce prodigious snowfall amounts. It is estimated about 10% of the annual precipitation in the city can be attributed to the lake effect.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bauman|first=Joe|url=https://www.deseret.com/1999/8/5/19459076/lake-has-great-impact-on-storms-weather|title=Lake has great impact on storms, weather|newspaper=Deseret News|date=August 5, 1999|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213059/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/710986/Lake-has-great-impact-on-storms-weather.html?pg=all|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

During mid-winter, strong areas of high pressure often stagnate over the [[Great Basin]], leading to strong [[temperature inversion]]s. This causes [[air stagnation]] and thick [[smog]] in the valley from several days to weeks at a time and can result in the nation's worst air-pollution levels.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fahys|first=Judy|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=5372365&itype=NGPSID|title=Winter's bad air still choking Utah|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=March 7, 2007|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221518/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_5372365|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Frosch|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/us/utah-a-nature-lovers-haven-is-plagued-by-dirty-air.html?_r=0|title=Seen as Nature Lovers' Paradise, Utah Struggles With Air Quality|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 23, 2013|access-date=July 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022342/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/us/utah-a-nature-lovers-haven-is-plagued-by-dirty-air.html?_r=0|archive-date=July 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> This same effect will also occasionally play a role in the summer months, causing [[tropospheric ozone]] to peak in July & August, but in 2015 it started at the beginning of June.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maffly|first=Brian|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2678090&itype=CMSID|title=Summer ozone blast threatening Utahns' health, thanks to sunshine and car exhaust|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=June 29, 2015|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630231630/http://www.sltrib.com/home/2678090-155/utahs-heat-wave-brings-crummy-air|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2016 Salt Lake's air quality was ranked 6th worst in the nation by the American Lung Association.

Elections are held in odd-numbered years. Candidates take office in January of the following year.

The [[separation of church and state]] was the most heated topic in the days of the [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]] and [[People's Party of Utah]], when many candidates were also would-be LDS Church [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]]. This tension is still reflected today with the ''Bridging the Religious Divide'' campaign.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Peggy Fletcher Stack|Stack, Peggy Fletcher]] |title= Mormons, non-Mormons clear the air |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |location= Salt Lake City |date= January 21, 2006 |id= Accessed April 14, 2013}}</ref> This campaign was initiated when some city residents complained the Utah political establishment was unfair in its dealings with non-LDS residents by giving the LDS Church preferential treatment, while LDS residents perceived a growing [[anti-Mormon]] bias in city politics.

The city's political demographics are considerably more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] than the rest of Utah. While Utah as a whole is a strongly [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state, Salt Lake City is considered a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bastion. Since 1976, all of the city's mayors have been Democrats.

The city is home to several non-governmental think-tanks and advocacy groups such as the conservative Sutherland Institute, the progressive Alliance for a Better Utah, the gay-rights group Equality Utah, and the quality-growth advocates Envision Utah. Salt Lake hosted many foreign dignitaries during the 2002 Winter Olympics, and in 2006 the president of Mexico began his U.S. tour in the city and Israel's ambassador to the United States opened a cultural center.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.aifl.org/html/web/Lets_be_partners-May_2006_Utah.pdf | title=Let's be partners, Israel's ambassador urges governor | last=Kalev | first=Gol | access-date=April 14, 2013 | publisher=[[America–Israel Friendship League]] | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930015127/http://www.aifl.org/html/web/Lets_be_partners-May_2006_Utah.pdf | archive-date=September 30, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> President [[George W.

Other political leaders such as [[Howard Dean]] and [[Harry Reid]] gave speeches in the city in 2005.

In July 2013, a new Public Safety Building housing police, fire, and emergency dispatch employees opened. It was billed as the largest net zero energy building in the nation at opening, and is expected to be certified [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56618611&itype=CMSID|title=Salt Lake City Public Safety Building opens to fanfare|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=July 19, 2013|first=Jim II|last=Dalrymple|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221530/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56618611-78/building-public-lake-safety.html.csp|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1847, LDS pioneer Jane Dillworth held the first classes in her tent for the children of the first LDS families. In the last part of the 19th century, there was a lot controversy over how children in the area should be educated. LDS and non-LDS members could not agree on the level of religious influence in schools. Today, many LDS youths in grades 9 through 12 attend some form of religious instruction in addition to the public-school sessions, referred to as [[LDS Seminaries|seminary]]. Students are released from public schools at various times of the day to attend seminary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acluutah.org/seminary.htm|title=LDS Seminary in Public Schools|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|date=August 2007|access-date=April 14, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117093623/http://www.acluutah.org/seminary.htm|archive-date=January 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=50172502&itype=CMSID|title=Guv claims Corroon could eliminate LDS seminary|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|first=Robert|last=Gehrke|date=August 27, 2010|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221534/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50172502-76/corroon-herbert-education-governor.html.csp|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> LDS seminaries are often on church-owned property adjacent to the public school and within walking distance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/si/seminary?lang=eng|title=Seminary|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220325172830/https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/si/seminary?lang=eng|archive-date=March 25, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>

Due to high birth rates and large classrooms, Utah spends less per student than any other state, yet also spends more per capita (of total state population) than any state with the exception of Alaska. Money is always a challenge, and many businesses donate to support schools. Several districts have set up foundations to raise money. Recently, money was approved for the reconstruction of more than half of the elementary schools and one of the middle schools in the [[Salt Lake City School District]], which serves most of the area within the city limits. There are twenty-three K-6 elementary schools, five 7–8 middle schools, three 9–12 high schools (Highland, East, and West, with the former [[South High School (Salt Lake City)|South High]] being converted to the South City campus of the [[Salt Lake Community College]]), and an alternative high school (Horizonte) within the school district. In addition, Highland has recently been selected as the site for the charter school Salt Lake School for the Performing Arts (SPA). Many Catholic schools are in the city, including [[Judge Memorial Catholic High School]]. [[Rowland Hall-St. Mark's School]], established in 1867 by [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] Bishop [[Daniel Tuttle]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Quinn|first=Frederick|title=Building the "Goodly Fellowship of Faith" – A History of the Episcopal Church in Utah – 1867–1996|publisher=[[Utah State University Press]]|location=Logan UT|year=2004|chapter=1}}</ref> is the area's premier independent school.

===Conventions===
Salt Lake City is host to a number of conventions that come to the Crossroads of the West. With several large venues, including the [[Salt Palace]] and [[Delta Center]] in downtown, Salt Lake is capable of accommodating conventions upwards of 100,000 people.

[[Salt Lake Comic Con]], which started in 2013, had over 100,000 attendance within its first few years. Because of this, Salt Lake Comic Con started having a second event, FanX (Fan Experience) to give those who were not able to come to the fall Comic Con, a spring-time opportunity. The convention broke inaugural records in 2013, hosting the largest crowd of any inaugural comic convention.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865586042/Shatner-Lee-and-record-breaking-crowds-Inaugural-Salt-Lake-Comic-Con-ends-with-a-bang.html?pg=all|title=Shatner, Lee and Record Breaking Crowds Inaugural Salt Lake Comic Con Ends with a Bang|newspaper=Deseret News|date=September 9, 2013|access-date=September 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926080619/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865586042/Shatner-Lee-and-record-breaking-crowds-Inaugural-Salt-Lake-Comic-Con-ends-with-a-bang.html?pg=all|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The second event, FanX of 2014, and the fall event of 2014 both broke attendance records for the event, surpassing 120,000 people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865610424/Despite-growing-pains-Salt-Lake-Comic-Con-nets-another-record-breaking-event.html|title=Despite Growing Pains, SL Comic Con Nets Another Record-Breaking Event|newspaper=Deseret News|date=September 6, 2014|access-date=September 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926080622/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865610424/Despite-growing-pains-Salt-Lake-Comic-Con-nets-another-record-breaking-event.html|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The convention was sued<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/2691461-155/salt-lake-san-diego-comic-con-lawsuit|title=Salt Lake, San Diego Comic-Con Lawsuit Headed to Trial|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=July 2, 2015|access-date=September 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905044449/http://www.sltrib.com/home/2691461-155/salt-lake-san-diego-comic-con-lawsuit|archive-date=September 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865611604/Trademark-battle-Salt-Lake-convention-cites-other-events-named-comic-con-in-latest-court-filing.html?pg=all|title=Trademark Battle: Salt Lake Convention Cites Other Events Named "Comic Con" in Latest Court Filing|newspaper=Deseret News|date=September 23, 2014|access-date=September 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926080625/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865611604/Trademark-battle-Salt-Lake-convention-cites-other-events-named-comic-con-in-latest-court-filing.html?pg=all|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> by [[San Diego Comic-Con]], but won the right to use the trademark of comic con in its name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/2761231-155/salt-lake-scores-win-with-trademark|title=Salt Lake Scores Win With Trademark Office Amid San Diego Comic-Con Lawsuit|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=July 23, 2015|access-date=September 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926043906/http://www.sltrib.com/home/2761231-155/salt-lake-scores-win-with-trademark|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://saltlakecomiccon.com/san-diego-comic-con-intl-vs-salt-lake-comic-con-3/|title=San Diego Comic-Con International vs. SL Comic Con Court Documents|publisher=Salt Lake Comic Con|access-date=September 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917181351/http://saltlakecomiccon.com/san-diego-comic-con-intl-vs-salt-lake-comic-con-3/|archive-date=September 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2014, [[Stan Lee]] called the Salt Lake Comic Con "the greatest comic con in the world".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/1541295-155/lee-comic-salt-lake-con-fans|title=Stan Lee Declares Salt Lake Comic Con "Greatest" in the World|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=September 6, 2014|access-date=September 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926020632/http://www.sltrib.com/home/1541295-155/lee-comic-salt-lake-con-fans|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> On September 25, 2015, the Con broke the world record for the most costumed comic book cosplay characters in one location.

===Events===
[[File:2002 Winter Olympics flame.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic flame]] burns at [[Rice-Eccles Stadium]]. Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics.]]

Salt Lake City has many diverse [[Mass media|media]] outlets. Most of the major television and [[radio station]]s are based in or near the city. The Salt Lake City metropolitan area is ranked as the 28th largest radio<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/radio-market-survey-population-rankings-information.pdf|title=RADIO MARKET SURVEY POPULATION, RANKINGS & INFORMATION SPRING 2020|publisher=Nielsen|accessdate=February 18, 2021|archive-date=April 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428175908/https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/radio-market-survey-population-rankings-information.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> and 33rd largest television<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvb.org/markets_stations#!id=167&type=market|title=Markets & Stations: DMA: Salt Lake City, UT|publisher=[[Television Bureau of Advertising]]|access-date=April 16, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409153711/http://www.tvb.org/markets_stations#!id=167&type=market|archive-date=April 9, 2013}}</ref> market in the United States.

Print media include two major daily newspapers, ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Deseret News]]'' (previously the ''Deseret Morning News''). Other more specialized publications include ''Now Salt Lake'', ''[[Salt Lake City Weekly]]'' (a weekly independent publication), ''Nuestro Mundo'' of the Spanish-speaking community,'' [[QSaltLake]]'' and ''The Pillar'' for the LGBT community. Other Spanish-language newspapers include ''El Estandar'', ''Amigo Hispano'' (online only), and ''El Observador de Utah'', which offers free residential delivery. There are a number of local magazines, such as ''Wasatch Journal'' (a quarterly magazine covering Utah's arts, culture, and outdoors), ''Utah Homes & Garden'', ''Salt Lake Magazine'' (a bimonthly lifestyle magazine), ''[[CATALYST Magazine]]'' (a monthly environmental, health, arts and politics magazine), ''[[SLUG Magazine]]'', an alternative underground music magazine. ''[[Utah Stories]]'' is a magazine that covers local issues, primarily focused on the Salt Lake Valley.

[[KTVX]] 4 signed on the air as Utah's first television station in 1947 under the experimental callsign W6SIX, becoming the [[Mountain Time Zone]]'s oldest and third-oldest west of [[Mississippi River|the Mississippi]]. It is Salt Lake City's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate. [[KSL-TV]] 5, the local [[NBC]] affiliate, has downtown studios at "Broadcast House" in the [[Triad Center]] office complex. KSL is operated by [[Bonneville International]], a company owned by the [[Deseret Management Corporation]]. [[KUTV]] 2 is Salt Lake City's [[CBS]] affiliate. [[KSTU]] 13 is the area's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate, owned by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]]. [[KUCW]] 30 is Salt Lake City's [[The CW|CW]] outlet owned and operated by [[Nexstar Media Group]], and is part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with KTVX. [[KJZZ-TV]] 14 is an independent station owned by [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], and is part of a triopoly with KUTV and [[St. George, Utah|St. George]]-licensed [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[KMYU]] 12.

Because television and radio stations serve a larger area (usually the entire state of Utah, as well as parts of western Wyoming, southern Idaho, parts of Montana, and eastern Nevada), ratings returns tend to be higher than those in similar-sized cities. Some Salt Lake radio stations are carried on [[broadcast translator]] networks throughout the state.

Salt Lake City has become a case of [[market saturation]] on the [[FM radio|FM]] dial; one cannot go through more than about two frequencies on an FM [[radio tuner]] before encountering another broadcasting station. Several companies, most notably Millcreek Broadcasting and [[Simmons Media Group|Simmons Media]], have constructed [[antenna (radio)|broadcast towers]] on [[Humpy Peak]] in the [[Uinta Mountains]] to the east. These towers allow frequencies allocated to nearby mountain communities to be boosted by smaller, low-powered FM transmitters along the Wasatch Front.

==Main sights==
{{Main|Buildings and sites of Salt Lake City}}
[[File:Temple Square October 05 (8) c.JPG|thumb|[[Salt Lake Temple]]]]
Salt Lake City is the headquarters of the LDS Church and has many LDS-related sites open to visitors. The most popular is [[Temple Square]], which includes the [[Salt Lake Temple]] (not open to the general public) and visitor centers open to the public, free of charge. Temple Square includes the historic [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]], home of the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]], now called The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. The [[LDS Conference Center]] is north of Temple Square. The [[Family History Library]], the world's largest genealogical library, is west of Temple Square. It is run by the LDS Church and is open to the public and free of charge. The [[Eagle Gate]] Monument is east of Temple Square.

In 2004, the Salt Lake City main library received an Institute Honor Award for Architecture by the [[American Institute of Architects]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aia.org/gallery_template.cfm?pagename=art%5Fsaltlakecitypubliclibrary|title=American Institute of Architects Institute Honor Award|publisher=AIA|access-date=December 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104065523/http://www.aia.org/gallery_template.cfm?pagename=art_saltlakecitypubliclibrary|archive-date=January 4, 2009}}</ref> and features a distinctive architectural style. The building's roof serves as a viewpoint for the Salt Lake Valley. The Utah State Capitol Building offers marble floors and a dome similar to the building that houses the US Congress. Other notable historical buildings include the [[Thomas Kearns]] Mansion (now the [[Utah Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]]), [[Salt Lake City and County Building|City and County Building]] (built 1894), the Kearns Building on Main Street, St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral (built 1874), and the Roman Catholic [[Cathedral of the Madeleine]] (built 1909).

The [[Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park|Olympic Cauldron Park]] at Rice-Eccles Stadium features the [[Olympic Flame|Olympic Cauldron]] from the games, a visitor center, and the [[Hoberman Arch]]. The Olympic Legacy Plaza, at The Gateway, features a dancing fountain set to music and the names of 30,000 Olympic volunteers carved in stone. The [[Utah Olympic Park]], near Park City, features the Olympic [[ski jump]]s, as well as [[bobsleigh]], [[luge]], and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] runs. Today, the Olympic Park is used for year-round training and competitions. Visitors can watch the various events and even ride a bobsled. The [[Utah Olympic Oval]], in nearby [[Kearns, Utah|Kearns]], was home to the [[speed skating]] events and is now open to the public. Other popular Olympic venues include [[Soldier Hollow]], the site of cross-country skiing events, southeast of Salt Lake near [[Heber City, Utah|Heber City]].

Salt Lake City is near several world-class ski and summer resorts, including [[Snowbird, Utah|Snowbird]], [[Alta Ski Area|Alta]], [[Brighton Ski Resort|Brighton]], [[Solitude Mountain Resort|Solitude]], [[Park City Mountain Resort]], and [[Deer Valley]]. The resorts cater to millions of visitors each year and offer year-round activities.

Salt Lake City is home to a few major shopping centers. [[Trolley Square]] is an indoor and outdoor mall with independent art boutiques, restaurants, and national retailers. The buildings housing the shops are renovated [[tram|trolley]] barns with cobblestone streets. The Gateway, an outdoor shopping mall, has many national restaurants, clothing retailers, a movie theater, the [[Clark Planetarium]], the Discovery Gateway (formerly The Children's Museum of Utah), a music venue called The Depot, and the Olympic Legacy Plaza. City Creek Center is the city's newest major shopping center and features high-end retailers not found anywhere else in Utah.

On October 3, 2006, the LDS Church, which owned the [[ZCMI Center Mall]] and [[Crossroads Plaza (Utah)|Crossroads Plaza Mall]], both on Main Street, announced plans to demolish the malls, a skyscraper, and several other buildings to make way for the $1.5&nbsp;billion City Creek Center redevelopment. It combined new office and residential buildings (one of which is the city's third-tallest building) around an outdoor shopping center featuring a stream, fountain, and other outdoor amenities;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.deseret.com/2006/10/4/19977589/downtown-rebound-lds-church-unveils-plans-for-20-acre-development|title=Downtown rebound: LDS Church unveils plans for 20-acre development|last=Smeath|first=Doug|newspaper=Deseret News|date=October 4, 2006|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117101823/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650196045/Downtown-rebound-LDS-Church-unveils-plans-for-20-acre-development.html|archive-date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> it opened on March 22, 2012.

==Sports and recreation==
Winter sports, such as skiing and [[snowboarding]], are popular activities in the [[Wasatch Mountains]] east of Salt Lake City. Eight ski resorts lie within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of the city. Alta, Brighton, Solitude, and [[Snowbird ski resort|Snowbird]] all lie directly to the southeast in the Wasatch Mountains, while nearby Park City contains three more resorts. The popularity of the ski resorts has increased by a third since the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wolfcreekresort.com/news-SLT-5-17-06.htm|title=Utah's ski industry chalks up another record year for visitors|first=Mike|last=Gorrell|author2=[[Knight Ridder]]|date=May 16, 2006|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810100608/http://www.wolfcreekresort.com/news-SLT-5-17-06.htm|archive-date=August 10, 2014}}</ref> Summer activities such as hiking, camping, rock climbing, mountain biking, and other related outdoor activities are popular in the mountains.

Salt Lake City has hosted two of the most important and most watched games in [[basketball]]. The [[1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game]] took place at the [[Jon M. Huntsman Center|Special Events Center]] on the campus of the University of Utah, where [[Magic Johnson]] met [[Larry Bird]] for the first time in their legendary rivalry. Johnson's [[1978–79 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]] team defeated Bird's previously unbeaten [[1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team|Indiana State]] team in the most watched [[college basketball]] game in history.<ref name="far">{{cite news |last=DeCamp |first=Scott |title=NCAA tournament final ratings up, but still far cry from Magic–Bird in 1979 |url=https://www.mlive.com/spartans/2017/04/ncaa_tournament_final_ratings.html |publisher=MLive |date=April 6, 2017 |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> [[Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals]] took place at the [[Delta Center]], where [[Michael Jordan]] played his final game as a member of the [[Chicago Bulls]].

===Professional sports===
[[File:Delta Center 2023.jpg|thumb|The [[Delta Center]] is the home of the [[Utah Jazz]] since 1991 and the home of the [[Utah Hockey Club]] since 2024.]]
Salt Lake City is home to the [[Utah Jazz]] of the NBA, who moved from New Orleans in 1979 and play their home games in the [[Delta Center]] (formerly known as EnergySolutions Arena and later as Vivint Arena). Until the establishment of the [[Utah Hockey Club]] in 2024, the Jazz were the only team of the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|top-level professional sports leagues]] in the state. The franchise has enjoyed steady success, at one point making the playoffs in 22 out of 25 seasons, led by [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] duo [[Karl Malone]] and [[John Stockton]]. The duo won two [[NBA Western Conference|Western Conference]] championships together, but the franchise has yet to win an NBA championship. Salt Lake City was home to a professional basketball team, the [[Utah Stars]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA), between 1970 and 1975. They won one championship in the city (in 1971) and enjoyed some of the strongest support of any ABA team, but they folded just months before the [[ABA–NBA merger]], thus preventing them from being absorbed by the NBA. Their success may have had a hand in the decision by the struggling Jazz to relocate to Salt Lake City in 1979. Salt Lake City was home to an original [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA) team, the [[Utah Starzz]], in 1997. The team relocated and became the [[San Antonio Silver Stars]].<ref name="playoffs">{{cite news |last=Elfman |first=Lois |url= http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2019/sep/19/wnba-playoffs-semi-finals/ |title=WNBA Playoffs into the semi-finals |work=[[New York Amsterdam News]] |date=September 19, 2019 |access-date=February 25, 2020}} in 2003.</ref>

There are also two minor league teams in the city. The [[Pacific Coast League]]'s [[Salt Lake Bees]], the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Angels]], play at [[Smith's Ballpark]] and were established in 1994 as the Buzz. Their name was changed to the Stingers in 2002, and then to the Bees, a historical Salt Lake City baseball team name, in 2006. The [[Utah Grizzlies]] ice hockey team of the [[ECHL]] were established in 2005, replacing the [[Utah Grizzlies (1995–2005)|previous Grizzlies team]] that existed from when they relocated from Denver in 1995 to 2005 in the International Hockey League (IHL), and later, the American Hockey League (AHL). They play at the [[Maverik Center]] in neighboring West Valley City.

===Amateur sports===
[[The University of Utah]] and [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) both maintain large followings in the city, and the [[BYU–Utah rivalry|rivalry]] between the two colleges has a long and storied history. Despite the fact that Utah is a secular university, the rivalry is sometimes referred to as the [[Holy War (BYU–Utah)|Holy War]] because of BYU's status as an LDS Church-owned university. Until the 2011–12 season, they both played in the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MWC) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] and have played each other over 100 times in football since 1896.

While Salt Lake City does not have a professional [[American football|football]] team, the [[college football]] teams of both universities are popular in the city and the state as a whole. The [[2004 Utah Utes football team|University of Utah]] was the first school from a non-automatic qualifying conference to win two [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) [[bowl game]]s (and was the first from outside the BCS affiliated conferences to be invited to one) since the system was introduced in 1998. [[1984 BYU Cougars football team|BYU]] defeated the [[1984 Michigan Wolverines football team|University of Michigan]] in the [[1984 Holiday Bowl]] to win the state's only [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|college football national championship]]. The University of Utah was a part of the controversy surrounding the fairness of the BCS. Despite undefeated seasons in both [[2004 Utah Utes football team|2004]] and [[2008 Utah Utes football team|2008]], Utah was not invited to participate in the national championship in either season because it was a member of the MWC, a BCS non-automatic qualifying conference.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=3814472|title=Utah AG: BCS may violate antitrust laws|work=[[ESPN]]|date=January 7, 2009|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329011447/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3814472|archive-date=March 29, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

College basketball also has an important presence in the city. The [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah Utes men's basketball team]] plays its home games at the [[Jon M. Huntsman Center]] on its campus in Salt Lake City. The team won the [[1944 NCAA basketball tournament]] and made the final of the [[1998 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1998 NCAA basketball tournament]]. The school has also hosted the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]] many times, both at the Huntsman Center and [[Delta Center]], including the Final Four of the famous [[1979 NCAA Division I basketball tournament|1979 tournament]], when it was known as the Special Events Center.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Salt Lake City}}

===Roads===
[[File:Utah State Capitol seen from State Street.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of State Street at the foot of the Utah State Capitol]]
Salt Lake City lies at the convergence of two cross-country freeways; [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] running north–south, and [[Interstate 80 in Utah|I-80]], which connects downtown with Salt Lake City International Airport to the west and exits to the east through [[Parley's Canyon]]. [[Interstate 215 (Utah)|I-215]] forms a 270-degree loop around the city. [[Utah State Route 201|SR-201]] extends to the western Salt Lake City suburbs. The [[Legacy Parkway]] (SR-67), a controversial and oft-delayed freeway, opened September 2008, heading north from I-215 into [[Davis County, Utah|Davis County]] along the east shore of the Great Salt Lake. Travel to and from Davis County is complicated by geography as roads have to squeeze through the narrow opening between the Great Salt Lake to the west and the Wasatch Mountains to the east. Only four roads run between the two counties to carry the load of [[rush hour]] traffic from Davis County.

Salt Lake City's surface street system is laid out on a simple [[grid pattern]]. Road names are numbered with a north, south, east, or west designation, with the grid originating at the southeast corner of Temple Square downtown. One of the visions of Brigham Young and the early settlers was to create wide, spacious streets, which characterizes downtown. The grid pattern remains fairly intact in the city, except on the East Bench, where geography makes it impossible. The entire Salt Lake Valley is laid out on the same numbered grid system, although it becomes increasingly irregular further into the suburbs. Many streets carry both a name and a grid coordinate. Usually both can be used as an address. [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|US-89]] enters the city from the northwest, becomes 900 West Street through the northern part of the city, and then exits Salt Lake City as State Street (100 East).

===Public transportation===
[[File:Buses at Central Station.jpg|thumb|UTA [[transit bus]]es at the [[Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub]] (Salt Lake Central Station)]]
Salt Lake City's [[public transport|mass transit]] service is operated by the [[Utah Transit Authority]] (UTA) and includes a bus system, light rail, and a commuter rail line. Intercity services are provided by [[Amtrak]] and various intercity bus lines. These services are all interconnected at the [[Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub]] (Salt Lake Central Station), west of the city center.

====Transit bus service====
UTA's bus system extends throughout the Wasatch Front from [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]] in the north to [[Santaquin, Utah|Santaquin]] in the south and as far west as [[Grantsville, Utah|Grantsville]], as well as east to Park City. UTA also operates routes to the [[ski resorts]] in [[Big Cottonwood Canyon|Big]] and [[Little Cottonwood Canyon|Little]] Cottonwood Canyons, as well as [[Sundance Resort|Sundance]] in [[Provo Canyon]], during the ski season (typically November to April). Approximately 60,000 people ride the bus daily, although ridership has reportedly declined since TRAX was constructed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/News/ci_8658942|title=Bus riders press for probe of UTA|last=Loomis|first=Brandon|date=March 22, 2008|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=October 20, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221543/http://www.sltrib.com/News/ci_8658942|archive-date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>

====Intercity bus and rail services====
[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Salt Lake City operating its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' daily between [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]] and [[Emeryville, California]]. [[Greyhound Lines]] serves Salt Lake City as well. Their nine daily buses provide service to Denver, Reno, Las Vegas, and Portland, Oregon. Both of these stations are at the [[Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub]].

===Air transportation===
[[File:SLC airport, 2010.jpg|thumb|Salt Lake International Airport sits between downtown Salt Lake City and the [[Great Salt Lake]].]]
[[Salt Lake City International Airport]] is {{Convert|4|mi|km|abbr=}} west of downtown, and falls entirely within the boundary of Salt Lake City. Delta Air Lines operates a hub at the airport, serving over 100 non-stop destinations in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as Paris, London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/business/ci_12890726|title=Swine flu, economy prompt Delta to trim SLC-Tokyo route|last=Beebe|first=Paul|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date= July 22, 2009|access-date= October 20, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221547/http://www.sltrib.com/business/ci_12890726|archive-date= October 21, 2014}}</ref> [[SkyWest Airlines]] operates its largest hub at the airport as [[Delta Connection]], and serves 243 cities as Delta Connection and [[United Express]]. The airport is served by four UTA bus routes, and a UTA-operated light rail line (TRAX) opened services on April 14, 2013. A total of 22,029,488 passengers flew through Salt Lake City International Airport in 2007, representing a 2.19% increase over 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slcairport.com/cmsdocuments/airstats2007_12.pdf|title=Salt Lake City International Airport Statistics|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326031056/http://www.slcairport.com/cmsdocuments/airstats2007_12.pdf|archive-date=March 26, 2009}}</ref> The airport ranks as the 21st busiest airport in the United States in total passengers, is consistently rated first in the country in on-time arrivals and departures, and has the second-lowest number of cancellations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1|title=Research and Innovative Technology Administration|publisher=Bureau of Transportation Statistics|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012160433/http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1|archive-date=October 12, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The airport is undergoing a $3.6&nbsp;billion rebuild that is expected to be completed in 2026, resulting in a complete reworking of the terminals and parking areas.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://slcairport.com/thenewslc/future-phases/ | title=Future Phases &#124; Salt Lake City International Airport }}</ref>

There are two [[general aviation]] airports nearby, although they lie outside Salt Lake City:
* [[South Valley Regional Airport]] in [[West Jordan, Utah|West Jordan]]
* [[Skypark Airport]] in [[Woods Cross, Utah|Woods Cross]].

Salt Lake City owns and operates the international airport, as well as the South Valley Regional Airport and the [[Tooele Valley Airport]] through its department of airports.

===Cycling===
Salt Lake City is considered a bicycle-friendly city. In 2010, Salt Lake City was designated as a Silver-level Bicycle Friendly Community<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bikeleague.org/content/league-announces-spring-2010-bicycle-friendly-communities|title=League Announces Spring 2010 Bicycle Friendly Communities|date=May 1, 2010|access-date=October 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221505/http://bikeleague.org/content/league-announces-spring-2010-bicycle-friendly-communities|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> by the [[League of American Bicyclists]], placing the city in the top 18 bicycling cities in the U.S. with a population of at least 100,000. Many streets in the city have bike lanes, and the city has since published a bicycle map.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeslc.com/WheretoRide/SLCBikeMap.html|title=Salt Lake City Bike Map|publisher=BikeSLC|access-date=October 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221459/http://www.bikeslc.com/WheretoRide/SLCBikeMap.html|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> However, off-road biking in the valley has suffered significantly as access to trails and paths has declined with the increase of housing developments and land privatization. In 2012, the Salt Lake Transportation Division launched ''BikeSLC.com'', which consolidates the city's information about bicycle routes, [[bicycle safety]], and promotions. The website includes a form for business owners to request bicycle parking racks to be installed on public property free of charge close to their businesses, a service that has a months-long waiting list.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bike Racks and Corrals|url=http://www.bikeslc.com/WheretoRide/BicycleParking/BikeRacksandCorrals.html|work=BikeSLC|access-date=October 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221536/http://www.bikeslc.com/WheretoRide/BicycleParking/BikeRacksandCorrals.html|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Salt Lake City was the first US city to use the "Green Shared Lane", or "super sharrow",<ref>{{cite news|title=Mea Culpa: Long Beach Not First to Have Colored Shared Lane|url=http://la.streetsblog.org/2009/07/06/mea-culpa-long-beach-not-first-to-have-colored-shared-lane/|newspaper=[[Streetsblog]]|date=July 6, 2009|access-date=December 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110191518/http://la.streetsblog.org/2009/07/06/mea-culpa-long-beach-not-first-to-have-colored-shared-lane/|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} wide green band down the middle of a travel lane where adding a dedicated bike lane is unfeasible. Other cities such as Long Beach, Oakland, and Edina, Minnesota have introduced similar designs. These four cities are participating in a study by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] to measure the effect of the design on automobile speed and passing distance when overtaking bicycles, crashes between automobiles and bicycles, and whether it encourages more bicycle ridership, along with other metrics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green-Colored Pavement with the Shared-Lane Marking|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/guidance/design_guidance/mutcd/gcp_slm.cfm|work=Federal Highway Administration website|access-date=December 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202044037/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/guidance/design_guidance/mutcd/gcp_slm.cfm|archive-date=December 2, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On September 25, 2010, UTA in partnership with Salt Lake City, the [[Utah Department of Transportation]], the Wasatch Front Regional Council, and the Mayor's Bicycle Advisory Committee, opened a Bicycle Transit Center (BTC) at the Intermodal Hub. The BTC is anticipated to serve multi-modal commuters from TRAX and ''FrontRunner'', as well as providing a secure bicycle parking space for bicycle tourists who want to tour the city on foot or transit.

In April 2013, Salt Lake City launched a bike share program known as GREENbike. The program allows users to pay $5 per day to access bicycles, with the option of purchasing a weekly or annual pass.<ref>{{cite news|title=Salt Lake to Launch Bike Share Program|url=http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top_stories/story/Salt-Lake-to-launch-bike-share-program/OUf9PeC-lEuuq4144PLv-Q.cspx|agency=Associated Press|access-date=May 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511063147/http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top_stories/story/Salt-Lake-to-launch-bike-share-program/OUf9PeC-lEuuq4144PLv-Q.cspx|archive-date=May 11, 2013}}</ref> The program launched with ten stations in the downtown core.<ref>{{cite news|title=Salt Lake City launches GREENbike bicycle sharing|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56124471&itype=CMSID|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=April 8, 2013|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021132719/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56124471-78/greenbike-lake-salt-bicycle.html.csp|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> By October 2014, the number of stations had expanded to 20.<ref>{{cite web|title=GREENbikeSLC|url=http://www.greenbikeslc.org/home.aspx|work=GREENbikeSLC website|access-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221506/https://www.greenbikeslc.org/home.aspx|archive-date=October 21, 2014}}</ref> In addition to the bike-sharing program, eighty businesses in the city participate in the Bicycle Benefits program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicyclebenefits.org/index.php?option=com_sobi2&catid=5&Itemid=54|title=Bicycle Benefits|website=bicyclebenefits.org|access-date=August 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223094558/http://www.bicyclebenefits.org/index.php?option=com_sobi2&catid=5&Itemid=54|archive-date=December 23, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> which provides discounts to customers who arrive by bicycle. The city is also home to the [[Salt Lake City Bicycle Collective]].

As a result of this increasing support, Salt Lake City's on-road bikeway network has grown to encompass 200 lane miles. In July 2014, the city began construction of a [[segregated cycle facilities|protected bicycle lane]] on a {{convert|1.35|mi}} segment of 300 South between 300 West and 600 East. The project received significant opposition from business owners and residents along the route because of concerns about the 30% reduction in car parking spaces and disruptions resulting from construction. The construction proceeded in stages, with the last stage completed in October 2014. The performance of the protected bicycle lane (specifically, its role in encouraging more bicycle ridership) will influence future plans for making the city more bicycle-friendly.<ref>{{cite news|title=New downtown Salt Lake City bicycle track worries small businesses|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=58348049&itype=CMSID|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|first=Christopher|last=Smart|date=August 31, 2014|access-date=May 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021131150/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/58348049-90/300-bike-broadway-business.html.csp|archive-date=October 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

One example of the city's cycling and walking routes is the loop around [[City Creek Canyon]] on Bonneville Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Creek Canyon/Memory Grove|url=http://www.bikeslc.com/WheretoRide/Multi-usePavedTrails/CityCreekMemoryGrove.html|work=BikeSLC|access-date=October 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015013730/http://www.bikeslc.com/WheretoRide/Multi-usePavedTrails/CityCreekMemoryGrove.html|archive-date=October 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The city has designated the road as one lane only (one-way) for motor vehicles, turning the other lane over to two-way cyclists and pedestrians. From the last Monday in May to the last weekend in September, City Creek Canyon Road itself is closed to motor vehicles on odd-numbered days, while bicycles are prohibited on even-numbered days and holidays. Bicycles are allowed every day for the rest of the year.
