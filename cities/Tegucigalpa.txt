== Etymology ==
Most sources indicate the origin and meaning of the word ''Tegucigalpa'' is derived from the [[Nahuatl language]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.ws/lepasil1/addenda.html |title=Dictionary of Honduran Colloquialisms, Idioms and Slang |author=Eric Schwimmer |publisher=geocities.ws |date=2003-02-24 |access-date=2011-06-29 |archive-date=30 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330052140/http://www.geocities.ws/lepasil1/addenda.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The most widely accepted version suggests that it comes from the Nahuatl word ''Taguz-galpa'', which means "hills of silver", but this interpretation is uncertain since the natives who occupied the region at the time were unaware of the existence of mineral deposits in the area.

Another source suggests that ''Tegucigalpa'' derives from another language in which it means ''painted rocks'', as explained by Leticia Oyuela in her book ''Minimum History of Tegucigalpa''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Leticia de Oyuela |title=Historia Mínima de Tegucigalpa |year=1989 |publisher=Editorial Guaymuras |location=Honduras |isbn=978-99926-15-92-8 |ol=1971859M}}</ref> Other theories indicate it may derive from the term ''Togogalpa'', which refers to ''tototi'' (meaning a small green parrot, in Nahuatl) and ''Toncontín'', a small town near Tegucigalpa (toncotín was a Mexican dance of Nahuatl origin).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tegus.info/ |title=History of Tegucigalpa |author=Tegus.info writer |publisher=Tegus.info |date=2003-05-07 |access-date=2011-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219001544/http://www.tegus.info/ |archive-date=2011-02-19 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ceducar.org/CULTURACENTROAMERICANA/El-Salvador/patrimonio-intangible/danzas-tradicionales/217-danza-de-los-emplumados- |title=Spanish: Danza de Los Emplumados |author=Coordinación de Registro e Inventario de Bienes Culturales |publisher=Comunidad Educativa de CentroAmérica y República Dominicana |date=2011-03-03 |access-date=2011-07-01 |archive-date=21 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021124633/http://ceducar.org/CULTURACENTROAMERICANA/El-Salvador/patrimonio-intangible/danzas-tradicionales/217-danza-de-los-emplumados- |url-status=live }}</ref>

In [[Mexico]], it is believed the word ''Tegucigalpa'' is from the Nahuatl word ''Tecuztlicallipan'', meaning "place of residence of the noble" or ''Tecuhtzincalpan'', meaning "place on the home of the beloved master".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocabulario.com.mx/nahuatl/diccionario_nahuatl_t.html |title=Náhuatl translations-meaning of Tegucigalpa |publisher=Vocabulario.com.mx |date=2008-03-09 |access-date=2011-07-01 |archive-date=7 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407152317/http://www.vocabulario.com.mx/nahuatl/diccionario_nahuatl_t.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Honduran [[philology|philologist]] Alberto de Jesús Membreño wrote in his book ''Indigenous Toponymies of Central America'' that he thinks Tegucigalpa is a Nahuatl word meaning "in the homes of the sharp stones" and rules out the traditional meaning "hills of silver" arguing that [[Taguzgalpa]] was the name of the ancient eastern zone of Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://famsi.org/pipermail/nahuatl/2009-October/001174.html |title=Nahuatl-The meaning of Tegucigalpa |author=Michael Swanton |publisher=Foundation of the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies (FAMSI) |date=2009-10-28 |access-date=2011-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043530/http://famsi.org/pipermail/nahuatl/2009-October/001174.html |archive-date=2011-10-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Tegucigalpa was founded by Spanish settlers as ''Real de Minas de San Miguel de Tegucigalpa'' on September 29, 1578, on the site of an existing native settlement of the [[Lenca people|Lenca]] and [[Tolupan people|Tolupans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/dpmapas/fmo/teg10/t.html |title=Spanish: History of Tegucigalpa |author=Mario Secoff |publisher=[[Angelfire]] |date=2006-09-19 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608163223/http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/dpmapas/fmo/teg10/t.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The first mayor of Tegucigalpa was ''Juan de la Cueva'', who took office in 1579.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hondurashoy.blogspot.com/2007/12/tegucigalpa-y-su-historia.html |title=Spanish: Tegucigalpa and her History |author=Mario Perez |publisher=HondurasHoy.blogspot.com |date=2007-12-12 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017200548/http://hondurashoy.blogspot.com/2007/12/tegucigalpa-y-su-historia.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The Dolores Church (1735), the San Miguel Cathedral (1765), the ''Casa de la Moneda'' (1780), and the Immaculate Conception Church (1788) were some of the first important buildings constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hondurasurbana.blogspot.com/2011/05/etapa-1740-1821.html |title=Spanish: History of Tegucigalpa, 1740–1821 period, 4th paragraph |author=Crecimiento Urbano |publisher=hondurasurbana.blogspot.com |date=2011-05-14 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326155626/http://hondurasurbana.blogspot.com/2011/05/etapa-1740-1821.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Almost 200 years later, on June 10, 1762, this mining town became ''Real Villa de San Miguel de Tegucigalpa y Heredia'' under the rule of [[Alonso Fernández de Heredia]], then-acting governor of Honduras. The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw disruption in Tegucigalpa's local government, from being extinguished in 1788 to becoming part of [[Comayagua]] in 1791 to returning to self-city governance in 1817.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/dpmapas/fmo/teg/teg.html |title=Spanish: Municipality of Tegucigalpa |author=Mario Secoff |publisher=[[Angelfire]] |date=2006-09-19 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=28 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928024129/http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/dpmapas/fmo/teg/teg.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1817, then-Mayor Narciso Mallol started the construction of the first bridge, a ten-arch masonry, connecting both sides of the Choluteca River.

After October 1838, following Honduras' independence as a single republic, the capital continued to switch back and forth between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua until October 30, 1880, when Tegucigalpa was declared the permanent capital of Honduras by then-president [[Marco Aurelio Soto]].<ref name="Capital"/> A popular myth claims that the society of Comayagua, the long-time colonial capital of Honduras, publicly disliked the wife of President Soto, who took revenge by moving the capital to Tegucigalpa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://larissamurillo.blogspot.com/2010/04/comayagua.html |title=Spanish: History of Comayagua, intro paragraph |author=Larissa Murillo |publisher=larissamurillo.blogspot.com |date=2010-04-29 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=3 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103075938/http://larissamurillo.blogspot.com/2010/04/comayagua.html |url-status=live }}</ref> A more likely theory is that the change took place because President Soto was an important partner of the [[Rosario Mining Company]], an American silver mining company, whose operations were based in [[San Juancito, Honduras|San Juancito]], close to Tegucigalpa, and he needed to be close to his personal interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/dpmapas/fmo/teg10/t.html |title=Spanish: Municipality of Tegucigalpa, 14th & 15th paragraphs |author=Mario Secoff |publisher=[[Angelfire]] |date=2006-09-19 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608163223/http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/dpmapas/fmo/teg10/t.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 1898, it was decided that both Tegucigalpa and Comayagua, being neighbor cities on the banks of the Choluteca River, would form the capital, but with separate names and separate local governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos52/municipios-honduras/municipios-honduras3.shtml |title=Spanish: Historical Background of Departments and Municipalities of Honduras, Decree No. 161 (COMAYAGÜELA) |author=ahrbom |publisher=monografias.com |date=2007-11-29 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104005803/http://www.monografias.com/trabajos52/municipios-honduras/municipios-honduras3.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> During this period, both cities had a population of about 40,000 people.

Between the 1930s and 1960s, Tegucigalpa continued to grow reaching a population of over 250,000 people, giving way to what would become one of the biggest neighborhoods in the city, the ''Colonia Kennedy''; the nation's autonomous university, the UNAH; and the construction of the ''Honduras Maya Hotel''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hondurasurbana.blogspot.com/2011/05/etapa-1933-1961.html |title=Spanish: History of Tegucigalpa, 1933–1961 period |author=Crecimiento Urbano |publisher=hondurasurbana.blogspot.com |date=2011-05-14 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326155712/http://hondurasurbana.blogspot.com/2011/05/etapa-1933-1961.html |url-status=live }}</ref> It still remained relatively small and provincial until the 1970s, when migration from the rural areas began in earnest.

Today, Tegucigalpa continues to sprawl far beyond its former colonial core: towards the east, south and west, creating a large but disorganized metropolis. In an effort to modernize the capital, increase its infrastructure and improve the quality of life of its inhabitants, the administration has passed several ordinances and projects to turn the city around within the upcoming years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hondurasurbana.blogspot.com/2011/05/etapa-2010-2011.html |title=Spanish: History of Tegucigalpa, 2010–2011 period |author=Crecimiento Urbano |publisher=hondurasurbana.blogspot.com |date=2011-05-14 |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-date=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326155723/http://hondurasurbana.blogspot.com/2011/05/etapa-2010-2011.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Like most of the interior highlands of Honduras, the majority of Tegucigalpa's current area was occupied by open [[woodland]]. The area surrounding the city continues to be open woodland supporting [[Temperate coniferous forest|pine forest]] interspersed with some [[oak]], [[Shrubland|scrub]], and [[Glade (geography)|grassy clearings]] as well as [[evergreen|needle leaf evergreen]] and [[Broad-leaved tree|broadleaf]] [[deciduous forest]].

The metropolitan area of both Tegucigalpa and Comayagua covers a total area of {{convert|77.6|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us|order=flip}} while the entire Municipality of the Central District covers a total area of {{convert|539.1|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name="Political Division">{{cite web |url=http://www.capital450.hn/doc_diagnostico/CAPITULO%201-LA%20COMPLEJIDAD%20URBANA%20Y%20AMBIENTAL.pdf |title=''Spanish'': Urban and Environmental Complexity of Tegucigalpa |author=Mario Martin |publisher=Centro de Diseño, Arquitectura y Construcción (CEDAC) |date=2009-06-02 |access-date=2011-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327174934/http://www.capital450.hn/doc_diagnostico/CAPITULO%201-LA%20COMPLEJIDAD%20URBANA%20Y%20AMBIENTAL.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Geological faults that are a threat to the neighborhoods on and below the hill have been identified in the District's high regions surrounding the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tierramerica.info/nota.php?lang=esp&idnews=eco&nro=486 |title=''Spanish'':HONDURAS-Geological faults identified in Tegucigalpa |author=Japan International Cooperation Agency |publisher=TierraAmérica |date=2011-01-13 |access-date=2011-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714233517/http://www.tierramerica.info/nota.php?lang=esp&idnews=eco&nro=486 |archive-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Rio Choluteca Tegucigalpa.jpg|thumb|The Choluteca River is prone to flooding during rainy seasons.]]
Tucked into a valley and bisected by a river, Tegucigalpa is prone to flooding during the rainy season, as experienced to the fullest during Hurricane Mitch and to a lesser degree every year during the rainy season. Despite being several thousand feet above sea level, the city lacks an efficient flood control system, including canals and sewerage powerful enough to channel rainwater back into the river to flow down to the ocean. The river itself is a threat since it isn't deep enough below the streets, nor are there levees high enough to prevent it from breaking out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Tegucigalpa/Ediciones/2010/05/31/Noticias/El-rio-Choluteca-inundo-mercados-y-colapso-quebradas-en-Tegucigalpa |title=Spanish: Choluteca River flooded markets and collapsed streams in Tegucigalpa |publisher=El Heraldo de Honduras |date=2010-05-30 |access-date=2010-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603190759/http://www.elheraldo.hn/Tegucigalpa/Ediciones/2010/05/31/Noticias/El-rio-Choluteca-inundo-mercados-y-colapso-quebradas-en-Tegucigalpa |archive-date=2010-06-03 |url-status=dead}}</ref> There are more than 100 neighborhoods deemed ''zones of high risk'', several of them ruled out as uninhabitable in their entirety.<ref name="High Risk" />

=== Hurricane Mitch ===
{{Main| Hurricane Mitch}}
[[File:Mitch-Tegucigalpa.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the capital after [[Hurricane Mitch]], November 1998]]
Tegucigalpa, as with the rest of Honduras, experienced significant damage by Hurricane Mitch in late-October and early-November 1998, something of a magnitude Hondurans had not witnessed since [[Hurricane Fifi]]. Mitch destroyed part of the Comayagua section of the city, as well as other places along the banks of the Choluteca River. The storm remained over Honduran territory for five days, dumping heavy rainfall late in the rainy season. The ground was already saturated and could not absorb the heavy precipitation, while deforestation and debris left by the hurricane led to catastrophic flooding throughout widespread regions of the country, especially in Tegucigalpa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historiadehonduras.hn/historia/Independiente/huracan_mitch.htm |title=''Spanish:'' Hurricane Mitch-estimate of loss and damages |author=Zeifer-Sistemas de Información Cultural |publisher=historiadehonduras.hn |date=2002-04-11 |access-date=2011-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917044323/http://www.historiadehonduras.hn/Historia/Independiente/huracan_mitch.htm |archive-date=2011-09-17 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The heavy rain caused flash floods of Choluteca's tributaries, and the swollen river overflowed its banks, tearing down entire neighborhoods and bridges across the ravaged city. The rainfall also triggered massive landslides around El Berrinche Hill, close to the downtown area. These landslides destroyed most of the Soto neighborhood, and debris flowed into the river, forming a dam. The dam clogged the waters of the river and many of the low-lying areas of Comayagua were submerged; historic buildings located along Calle Real were either completely destroyed or so badly damaged that repair was futile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archivo.laprensa.hn/Apertura/Ediciones/2008/10/20/Noticias/Mitch-un-monstruo-destructor |title=''Spanish:'' Mitch, a Destructive Monster |publisher=LaPrensa.hn |date=2008-10-19 |access-date=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406064800/http://archivo.laprensa.hn/Apertura/Ediciones/2008/10/20/Noticias/Mitch-un-monstruo-destructor |archive-date=2012-04-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Several of the main boulevards have been equipped with [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]], overpasses and underpasses, allowing for sections of [[Controlled-access highway|controlled-access]] highways, but considering that even the city's beltway does not entirely circle the city, the roads are generally [[Limited-access highway|limited-access]]. Intense webs of electrical and telephone lines above the streets are a common sight in the capital, and in virtually all Honduran cities, since the implementation of underground utility lines has only been adopted in recent years.

=== Around the city ===
[[File:TegucigalpaMayaHotelView.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Tegucigalpa as viewed westward from the Honduras Maya Hotel]]
The metropolitan area of Tegucigalpa and Comayagua is officially divided into ''[[barrio]]s'' and ''[[Colonia (Mexico)|colonias]]'' and there are 892 of them. ''Colonias'' represent relatively recent 20th-century [[middle class]] residential [[suburbs]], some known as ''residenciales'' for their upper income development, and these are continuously spreading while the ''barrios'' are old inner-city neighborhoods.

[[File:Tegucigalpa Map 5.png|thumb|right|Tegucigalpa's ''contemporary'' Center, formed by over 40 neighborhoods]] While the city administration divides the capital into barrios and colonias, the fact that there are hundreds of them makes it difficult to define the city's different regions, especially for those not familiar with the Central District. To have a better understanding of the city's regions, the metro area of the Central District can essentially be divided, first, into two sections: Tegucigalpa and Comayagua. These two entities remain separated by the Choluteca River Basin that runs between them.

The Tegucigalpa side of the District can be divided into five sections: '''1''') ''Centro Histórico'' (Historic Downtown); '''2''') ''Centro Contemporáneo'' or ''Zona Viva'' (Contemporary Downtown or Vibrant Zone); '''3''') North Tegucigalpa; '''4''') South Tegucigalpa; and '''5''') East Tegucigalpa.
[[File:Tegucigalpa MDC at night.jpg|thumb|The metropolitan area at night]]
*'''1''' – '''Centro Histórico''' or the Historic Downtown of Tegucigalpa is formed by the original neighborhoods that date back to its founding days. For years, this area remained neglected and run down, but in recent times attempts have been made to revive the zone and bring back its colonial heritage. Several government offices, including the National Congress and City Hall as well as museums, parks, a cathedral and churches are located here.
*'''2''' – '''Centro Contemporáneo''' is the contemporary, vibrant and modern downtown of Tegucigalpa. This area is formed by the neighborhoods encompassed east of the Choluteca River, south of the northern tributary, ''Rio Chiquito'' (which converges with the Choluteca below the Mallol Bridge), west of the beltway (Anillo Periférico), and north of Armed Forces Blvd.
This section of the city is perhaps the best developed and properly urbanized. It is formed by more than 40 neighborhoods, many of them wealthy middle class residential areas such as Colonia Palmira to the east of the historic center, on Boulevard Morazán, which hosts several foreign embassies as well as upscale restaurants. Other upscale neighborhoods are Lomas del Guijarro, Loma Linda, and Lomas del Mayab, which house most of the apartment complexes in the city.

[[File:Tegucigalpa Map 7.png|thumb|right|Metropolitan area of the Central District divided into colored sections]]
Boulevard Morazán and Avenida Los Próceres/Avenida La Paz are busy commercial corridors (running parallel to each other) and run through several neighborhoods home to foreign embassies, a hotel district, business establishments and corporate buildings, including Los Próceres Comercial Park (''Parque Comercial''). Boulevard Suyapa and Boulevard Juan Pablo II are located south of the aforementioned boulevards, and they also form a busy commercial and financial district stretching through several neighborhoods such as Colonia Los Profesionales where the Presidential House is located; Colonia Florencia Norte where Multiplaza Mall is located; Colonia Miramontes, among others—housing several financial institutions, government offices, hotels, etc.

*'''3''' – '''North Tegucigalpa''' is formed by both middle class and impoverished neighborhoods that lie above the surrounding hill immediately north of the historic downtown. Beyond these neighborhoods sits the United Nations National Park on El Picacho Hill, one of the most popular destinations in the capital among its residents and visitors. Beyond the Park, stretching north and northwest of the city, upper income suburban neighborhoods such as El Hatillo sit on the sides of the hills, surrounded by heavy vegetation.
*'''4''' – '''South Tegucigalpa''' is everything south of Boulevard Fuerzas Armadas. This area is home to Colonia Kennedy, the capital's largest neighborhood with more than 137,000 residents. South Tegucigalpa concentrates both middle class and poor neighborhoods. Two universities, [[Universidad Tecnológica de Honduras|UTH]] and [[Central American Technological University|UNITEC]], are located just off the beltway in southern outskirt neighborhoods.
*'''5''' – '''East Tegucigalpa''' concentrates mostly rural and impoverished neighborhoods, the result of improvised growth with little government funding and involvement. María Pediatric Hospital and the Basílica of Suyapa lie on the side of Anillo Períferico's eastern stretch.

=== Comayagüela ===
[[File:Comayagüela Central Bank Annex.jpg|thumb|Comayagüela as viewed from Juan A. Laínez Hill with the Central Bank of Honduras Annex building in the center]]
Comayaguela is found on the west bank of the Choluteca River, and most of its urbanization is made up of lower-income neighborhoods. Historically, Comayagua has remained less developed than the other side of the capital, some citing insufficient contribution from public officials. In recent years, this western side of the capital has seen some growth and improvement such as the opening of Metromall near the airport. With the construction of Mall Premier and City Mall, the latter to become the largest mall in the country, Comayagua will be receiving another upgrade. There are an estimated 650,000 residents in Comayagüela contributing 58.3 percent of the 120 million lempiras (US$6.349 million) generated every day by commerce in the Central District.

The Comayagua side of the capital can be divided into four sections: '''1''') Zona Centro (Downtown Comayagua); '''2''') North Comayagua; '''3''') South Comayagua; and '''4''') West Comayagua:

*'''1''' – '''Zona Centro de Comayagüela''' is the downtown area of Comayagua and also the original founding grounds formed by its oldest barrios. These barrios are formed in a [[grid plan|grid street plan]] style. Several government offices are located in this district, including the Central Bank of Honduras Annex building and the Criminal Bureau of Investigation (''Dirección General de Investigación Criminal'') as well as the National School of Fine Arts housed in the former City Hall building of Comayagüela, built in 1845.

[[File:Comayagüela City Mall site.jpg|thumb|Looking northeast from Comayagüela at the construction site of the upcoming shopping mall City Mall]]
*'''2''' – '''North Comayagüela''' is formed by relatively recent post-Hurricane Mitch middle class residential developments that stretch onto the northern hills of Comayagüela, such as Colonia Cerro Grande, a continuously growing middle-class neighborhood on the northern outskirts.
*'''3''' – '''South Comayagüela''' is by far the better-off region of Comayagüela. This area is found south and southwest of the airport, around Los Laureles Reservoir and south of Lepaterique Road (''Carretera Lepaterique'' also known as ''Carretera al Batallón''). Also a post-Hurricane Mitch area, it has grown in the last decade and includes some of Comayagüela's upper income communities that have erupted in the area and continues to spread out as newer suburban middle class developments are built. Toncontín International, Metro Mall and City Mall are located in this area. Residencial la Arboleda and Residencial los Hidalgos are some of the growing upper income developments in the southern outskirts of Comayagüela.
*'''4''' – '''West Comayagüela''' is mostly impoverished neighborhoods spreading away from Zona Centro onto the surrounding slopes. Many of these neighborhoods came to be through improvised urbanization and lack proper infrastructure. This area prevails north of Lepaterique Road and westward of ''Boulevard de la Comunidad Europea'' (European Community Blvd).

===Health===
In 2004, there were 67 [[public health care]] establishments in the Central District—five [[public hospital|national hospitals]], 22 health centers in the metropolitan area, 37 health centers throughout the rural areas, and three peripheral [[clinic]]s. There are several [[private hospital]]s in the city as well as hospitals run by the Honduran Social Security Institute (IHSS), the country's government-sponsored [[social insurance]] program.

In 2003, only 58.5 percent of the employed population contributed to IHSS while the rest who remain uninsured were attributed to being employed in the [[informal sector]] or being [[domestic workers]]. Overall, only 26.5 percent of the Central District's population is covered by public health care.

The Central District reports the third highest or 20.2 percent of the country's [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] incidence with 5,674 living with the [[virus]]. During 2004, there were 258 new diagnoses of HIV infection in the Central District.

In 2000, the [[maternal death|maternal mortality]] rate in the city was 110 of every 100,000 births of which 62.3 percent were women ages 20 to 35. In 2001, the [[infant mortality]] rate was 29 per 1000 live births (Both maternal and infant mortality rates are based on local and out-of-district residents who arrive to receive medical attention). In 2005, it was estimated that 101 of every 10,000 residents suffered from a physical or mental [[disability]].

===Religion===
[[File:Basilica Virgen de Suyapa.jpg|thumb|Basilica of our lady of Suyapa]]
As with the rest of Honduras, [[Roman Catholicism]] is the dominating religion in the Central District and while at some point they made up as much as 90 percent of the population, contemporary estimates as recent as 2007 put them at 47 percent while [[Protestants]] make up as much as 36 percent. Their history in Tegucigalpa began around 1548 with the Spanish setting up [[Mercedarian]] missionaries as part of their [[Religious conversion|conversion]] efforts of the native communities. By 1916, the Diocese of Comayagua was relocated and renamed the Diocese of Tegucigalpa, and it was elevated to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tegucigalpa|Archdiocese]] under Archbishop Santiago María Martínez y Cabanas (1842–1921).<ref name="Religion">{{cite web |url=http://www.prolades.com/encyclopedia/countries/english/honduras_religion_2009.pdf |title=Religion in Honduras |author=Clifton L.

Other religious groups made their way at the beginning of the 20th century including the [[Quakers]], who in 1914 began work in the nation's capital. In 1946, missionaries of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] first arrived in Tegucigalpa and in the 1950s, the [[Baptist Church|National Convention of Baptist Churches]] and the [[Eastern Mennonite Missions|Eastern Mennonite Board of Missions]] followed.<ref name="Religion"/>

The [[Assembly of God]] missionaries entered Honduras in the late 1940s and today maintain a mega-church in Tegucigalpa with more than 10,000 members. The [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] of [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], was established in Tegucigalpa in 1951, the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel]] followed in 1952, and by the late 1950s, the [[Evangelical Alliance|Evangelical Alliance of Honduras]] was established. The [[Pentecostal Church|Prince of Peace Pentecostal Church]], founded in Guatemala City, began its ministry in Honduras during the 1960s. During the 1970s, the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal|Catholic Charismatic Renewal Movement]] began to grow among the upper classes in Tegucigalpa.<ref name="Religion"/>

The [[Christian Love|Christian Love Brigade Association]] arrived in Tegucigalpa in 1971, the [[Christian Church|Abundant Life Christian Church]] was founded in 1972, the [[Charismatic Movement|Cenacle Christian Center of Charismatic Renewal]] began in 1978 and the Living Love Groups started in 1978.<ref name="Religion"/>

The [[Presbyterian Church in Honduras]] member churches are mainly concentrated within {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}} of Tegucigalpa. The first [[Presbyterian]] congregation was planted 50 years ago, by the [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.honduraspresbytery.com/Presbytery_of_Honduras/Welcome.html |title=La Iglesia Presbiteriana de Honduras |website=www.honduraspresbytery.com |access-date=14 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617152942/http://www.honduraspresbytery.com/Presbytery_of_Honduras/Welcome.html |archive-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Today, there are many religious groups in Tegucigalpa including a [[Jewish community]]; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], who opened a [[Tegucigalpa Honduras Temple|temple]] in the city in 2013.<ref name="Religion"/>

Honduras, including the capital city Tegucigalpa, has the world's highest murder rate.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pressly |first1=Linda |title=Honduras Murders: Where Life Is Cheap and Funerals Are Free |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17870673 |work=BBC Magazine |date=3 May 2012 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625193340/https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17870673 |url-status=live }}</ref> Honduras has been experiencing record-high [[violence]] in recent years. In 2010, the [[homicide rate]] in Francisco Morazán was 83.2 (per 100,000 inhabitants) compared to the national average of 86.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transparencia-seguridad.gob.hn/Transparencia/regulaciones/politica_integral_convivencia_seguridad_ciudadana.pdf |title=Spanish: Comprehensive Policy of Citizen Security for Honduras |author=United Nations Development Programme |publisher=transparencia-seguridad.gob.hn |date=2011-09-08 |access-date=2011-11-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001334/http://www.transparencia-seguridad.gob.hn/Transparencia/regulaciones/politica_integral_convivencia_seguridad_ciudadana.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-26}}</ref>

In 2009, the Central District reached a homicide rate of 72.7 with authorities recording 792 intentional [[murder|homicides]] and 151 [[involuntary homicide]]s; this averaged to 66 murders per month or two per day. 85.6 percent of the deaths were committed by [[gun violence|firearm]] and 39 percent were linked to [[organized crime]]. 91 percent of the victims were men and 81.2 of that were ages 15 to 39. The neighborhoods in Tegucigalpa reporting the highest incidence of violent deaths are poor and impoverished areas that include Barrio Concepción, Colonia Nueva Capital, Colonia Villa Nueva Norte, Colonia Cerro Grande, Colonia El Carrizal No. 1, Colonia el Carrizal No. 2, Colonia Flor Del Campo, Colonia La Sosa, Colonia Las Brisas, and Barrio Centro de Comayagüela.<ref name="Crime"/>

In 2009, there were 246 [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle-related]] deaths, of which 52 percent were pedestrians, including bicyclists; 39 percent were caused by private vehicles and 12 percent by public transportation vehicles. In the same year, there were 69 deaths reported as [[suicide]]s, which were most common in the age bracket of 20 to 29 and 30 to 35, while 76.9 percent of them were men.<ref name="Crime"/>

Having around eight million people in the country, Honduras has about 7,000 gang members in 300 to 400 street gangs, most of them based in Tegucigalpa. These gangs commit all types of crimes against the local population as well as foreigners, including phone call threats. The gangs also appear to have a lot of control in the cities with controlling public goods such as public taxis and they are very involved. The Honduran government does not have much control against the gangs because the government system is not itself very stable. Most of the crime cases are not very well prosecuted and sometimes just discarded, but police enforcement is better in the upper-class neighborhoods and in the tourists parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=19281 |title=Honduras 2016 crime and safety report |date=2016-03-14 |website=www.osac.gov |access-date=2016-11-14 |archive-date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215132529/https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=19281 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Legally and politically speaking, the capital of Honduras is the Municipality of the Central District ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''[[Distrito Central]] or DC'') with Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela as two entities within the district. However, nearly all governmental institutions are on the Tegucigalpa side, so for all practical purposes Tegucigalpa is the capital.<ref name="Official Capital"/> Traditionally, they are regarded as twin or sister cities in part because they were founded as two distinct cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2010/04/13/comayaguela/ |title=Spanish: History of Comayagüela |publisher=La Tribuna de Honduras |date=2010-04-13 |access-date=2010-09-28}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> When the Central District was formed on 30 January 1937 under Decree 53 of reformed Article 179 of the 1936 Honduran Constitution, both cities became one political entity sharing the title of ''Capital of Honduras''.<ref name="1937 Constitution"/>

City government takes the form of a [[mayor-council]] system and is regulated under the Law of Municipalities that came into effect on 1 January 1991. The Central District Municipal Government (''Alcaldía Municipal del Distrito Central'' or AMDC) is the city's governing authority. As established by city governing law, AMDC is structured as a [[municipal corporation]], which is the deliberative-legislative body, voter-elected, and highest authority within the municipality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capital450.hn/transparencia/corporacion.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327175556/http://www.capital450.hn/transparencia/corporacion.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-03-27 |title=Powers of the Municipal Corporation |author=Honduras National Congress |publisher=AMDC |date=1991-05-23 |access-date=2011-09-25}}</ref>

The Municipal Department of Justice (''Departamento Municipal de Justicia'') through its Municipal Police Court (''Juzgado de Policía Municipal'') enforces and prosecutes local law offenses.

The Public Ministry (''Ministerio Público'') is the [[district attorney]] with nationwide jurisdiction in charge of prosecuting crimes on behalf of [[The People (disambiguation)#Legal jargon|the people]]. It is also headquartered in the Central District and maintains regional prosecution offices throughout the country. The Attorney General of the Republic (''Procuraduría General de la República'') is the country's chief legal representative and prosecutes crimes on behalf of [[sovereign state|the state]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aiamp.net/sistema/UserFiles/File/MP_Honduras_AIAMP.pdf |title=Spanish: Attorney General of Honduras |author=Government of Honduras |publisher=Asociación Iberoamericana de Ministerios Públicos |date=2008-11-25 |access-date=2010-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326155636/http://www.aiamp.net/sistema/UserFiles/File/MP_Honduras_AIAMP.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-26 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Tegucigalpa serves as the national education center, hosting most of the universities and higher education institutions in the country. For 2011, the national government allocated L. 9.175 billion (US$484.9 million) of the national public education budget (equal to 42.1 percent of total) to the Central District.

The public and private education system in Tegucigalpa is divided into 16 school districts (''distritales'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://190.5.81.199/SEE/busqueda.php?pagina=1&nombre_centro=&codigo=&boleta=&depto=8&munic=110&admin=&tipo=&zona=&pais=&docentes=&pueblo=&filtrar=Buscar+Centros |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425002605/http://190.5.81.199/SEE/busqueda.php?pagina=1&nombre_centro=&codigo=&boleta=&depto=8&munic=110&admin=&tipo=&zona=&pais=&docentes=&pueblo=&filtrar=Buscar+Centros |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-25 |title=''Spanish:'' Educational Statistics System |author=Honduras Secretary of Education (SE) |publisher=se.gob.hn |date=2011-09-28 |access-date=2011-09-28}}</ref> All districts are part of the Departmental Directorate of Education (''Dirección Departamental de Educación''), which in turn is a part of the country's Secretary of Education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.se.gob.hn/index.php?a=Webpage&url=estructura |title=''Spanish:'' Secretary of Education Management Chart |author=Honduras Secretary of Education (SE) |publisher=se.gob.hn |date=2004-01-17 |access-date=2011-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009172241/http://www.se.gob.hn/index.php?a=Webpage&url=estructura |archive-date=2011-10-09 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

There are 1,235 [[State school|public schools]] in the Central District broken down as 488 [[preschools]], 563 [[elementary schools]], and 184 [[Middle school|middle]] and [[high schools]]. In 2003, there were a total of 287,517 students enrolled throughout the municipality—28,915 in preschool, 159,679 in elementary school, and 98,923 in middle or high school.<ref name="Education"/>
The literacy rate, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, is at 80%.

=== Private schools ===

There are about 147 bilingual schools in Tegucigalpa.<ref>Jerez, Blanca. ''Lista de Escuelas Bilingüe en el Distrital # 16''. Tegucigalpa: Sistema de Estadística Educativa, 2010, Distrital # 16.</ref> The [[American School of Tegucigalpa]] (K–12), [[Discovery School, Tegucigalpa|Discovery School]] (K–12), [[DelCampo International School]] (K–12), La Estancia School (K–11) and [[International School of Tegucigalpa]] (K–12, Christian) are considered the most expensive [[private schools]] of the city. Total K–12 tuition of The American School of Tegucigalpa costs a total of L.1.366 million (US$72,248) for all years (amount based on 10–11 academic year). These private schools are highly recognized by American institutions such as the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS-CASI) and the American School of Tegucigalpa is the only one that has the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB Program). Most of their students study abroad. Other popular private/bilingual schools include Elvel School (K–11), Dowal School (K–11, secular), La Estancia School (K–11), England School (K–11), Shadai School (K–11, Christian), [[Lycée Franco-Hondurien]] (K–12, French), Magic Castle Preschool (K), Summer-Hill School (K–11), Macris School (E-HS, Catholic), and ABC Educational Center (N-8avo, Christian).

There are two modalities in regards to the school calendar: American Period (August to July), mostly used by private and bilingual schools; and Latin Period (February to November), used by public schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.se.gob.hn/index.php?a=Webpage&url=calendario |title=''Spanish:'' Secretary of Education School Calendars |author=Honduras Secretary of Education (SE) |publisher=se.gob.hn |date=2004-01-17 |access-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009021656/http://www.se.gob.hn/index.php?a=Webpage&url=calendario |archive-date=2011-10-09}}</ref>

=== Universities ===
There are 12 universities in Tegucigalpa, including three state-funded higher education institutions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altillo.com/en/universities/universities_honduras.asp |title=Universities in Honduras |author=Honduras Secretary of Education |publisher=altillo.com |date=2010-07-06 |access-date=2011-07-15 |archive-date=11 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811132657/http://www.altillo.com/en/universities/universities_honduras.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[National Autonomous University of Honduras]] ([[National Autonomous University of Honduras|UNAH]]), founded in 1847, is the country's most important university and operates eight regional campuses in several other cities in the country: UNAH-Valle de Sula, UNAH-La Ceiba, UNAH-Comayagua, UNAH-Copán, UNAH-Choluteca, UNAH-[[Juticalpa]], UNAH-Valle del Aguán, and University Technological Center UNAH–Danlí.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unah.edu.hn/?cat=1013 |title=''Spanish:'' UNAH-Introduction |author=Rectoría y Comisión de Transición |publisher=UNAH.edu.hn |date=2008-02-20 |access-date=2011-07-15 |archive-date=26 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026220651/https://www.unah.edu.hn/?cat=1013 |url-status=live }}</ref> It employs 4,980 people throughout its campuses at an average annual salary of L.241,184 (US$12,747).

The other two publicly funded institutions are Francisco Morazán National Pedagogic University (UPNFM), founded in 1989, focusing on preparing future educators in several disciplines,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upnfm.edu.hn/ |title=''Spanish:'' UPHFM Official Website |author=UPNFM |publisher=upnfm.edu.hn |date=2011-09-24 |access-date=2011-09-25 |archive-date=1 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101043518/http://upnfm.edu.hn/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and the National Institute of Professional Formation (INFOP), founded in 1972, focusing on economic and social development disciplines.

All ''barrios'' and ''colonias'' in Tegucigalpa can be accessed by automobile, although some neighborhoods in the city suffer from unpaved, narrow, or hilly streets making them difficult to maneuver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2010/05/18/las-calles-tegucigalpenses/ |title=''Spanish:'' The streets of Tegucigalpa |author=La Tribuna writer |publisher=laTribuna.hn |date=2010-05-18 |access-date=2011-09-28}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> A grid of surface streets and a network of major avenues and boulevards cross through the major areas of the capital. However, the most transited roads suffer from heavy [[traffic congestion]] due to the region's geography and disorganized urbanization.

An estimate of 400,000 vehicles take on the city streets and roads every day. The oldest districts were not built with the advent of the automobile in mind and therefore lack efficient roadways to accommodate the overwhelming number of vehicles. Newer developments, such as the malls, have been built with the car in mind allowing for large parking lots to accommodate their visitors. In the last decades, several of the boulevards and avenues have been retrofitted with [[grade separation]]s to ease up the flow of traffic.

===Roads and highways===
[[File:Central District Map 2.png|thumb|right|Network of roads and highways throughout the Central District and its borders]]
The [[Secretariat of Public Works, Transport and Housing (Honduras)]] (SOPTRAVI) presently divides the country's [[Transportation in Honduras|highway network]] into international routes (''ruta internacional''), national routes (''ruta nacional''), and [[State highway|provincial routes]] (''ruta vecinal''). These are assigned numbers; however, they are more often identified using their physical destinations (e.g. Tegucigalpa-Danlí highway) rather the number itself since [[Traffic sign|road signage]] is scarce.

International routes are given a "CA-" [[Road designation or abbreviation|designation]] followed by a [[Route number|highway number]] (i.e. CA-1) that can be of one or two digits enclosed in a [[highway shield]]. "CA-" highways are part of the Central American highway network (hence the "CA" letters) that interconnects Honduras with its neighboring countries as part of the [[Pan-American Highway]]. National highways are assigned a two or three-digit number and provincial routes are assigned a three-digit number.

====Arterial roads====
[[File:AnilloPerifericoOverpass.jpg|thumb|left|Anillo Periférico (beltway) at the Suyapa Boulevard overpass near Basilica of Suyapa]]
[[File:Boulevard Fuerzas Armadas Tegus.jpg|thumb|right|Heading westbound on Armed Forces Blvd near the Metro Mall interchange]]
The ''Anillo Periférico'' (beltway or ring road) and ''Boulevard Fuerzas Armadas'' (Armed Forces Blvd) are the city's two expressways—equipped with center dividers, interchanges, overpasses and underpasses—allowing for controlled-access traffic. These connect with the city's other major boulevards: Central America Blvd, Suyapa Blvd, European Community Blvd, and Kuwait Blvd—which are essentially limited-access roadways as they have been equipped with interchanges but may lack underpasses or overpasses to bypass crossing surface road traffic.

Despite a network of major highways, none reach directly into the historic downtown, forcing drivers to rely heavily on surface streets. Like in most Central American cities, orientation and driving may be difficult to first-time visitors due to the nature of how streets are named, insufficient road signage and the natives' driving behavior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_Tegucigalpa.htm |title=Satellite View and Map of the City of Tegucigalpa (Tegus) |author=One World – Nations Online |publisher=nationsonline.org |date=2007-06-13 |access-date=2010-07-23 |archive-date=13 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813095708/http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_Tegucigalpa.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The city administration has green lit several road infrastructure projects to help reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall aspect of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hondudiario.com/content/alcald%C3%AD-habilita-un-carril-del-paso-desnivel-en-la-hacienda |title=Spanish: Mayor opens one lane at La Hacienda and Suyapa intercharge |author=Issis Ochoa |publisher=hondudiario.com |date=2011-10-04 |access-date=2011-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026080541/http://www.hondudiario.com/content/alcald%C3%AD-habilita-un-carril-del-paso-desnivel-en-la-hacienda |archive-date=2011-10-26 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Public transportation===
Public transportation in Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela is based on buses and taxis, covering 71 percent of the capital's road migration. {{citation needed|date=October 2021}} Bus routes are named based on the neighborhood they cover. For example, routes that travel from the downtown area to UNAH are labeled ''Centro-UNAH'' or ''Centro-Multiplaza-UNAH''. Taxis are the quickest way to move around the city after personal auto transportation. Taxis are relatively cheap for the international tourist.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} They are not the cheapest form of public transportation for the locals, however. There are over 12,000 taxis in the Central District. {{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The public transportation system in Tegucigalpa is, however, highly disorganized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2010/10/02/Noticias/Ordenar-transporte-publico-es-solucion-al-trafico-vial |title=Organizing public transport is the solution to traffic congestion |author=Karla Gómez |publisher=ElHeraldo.hn |date=2010-10-01 |access-date=2011-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204092111/http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2010/10/02/Noticias/Ordenar-transporte-publico-es-solucion-al-trafico-vial |archive-date=2015-02-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Being a for-profit business, it encourages competition between the fleet owners where revenue is the priority while ignoring the quality and efficiency of the service. Public transportation regulation is very flawed. Bus drivers must compete for passengers in order to bring the highest earnings possible while becoming a hazard for other drivers and pedestrians and contributing to traffic jams.<ref name="public transport">{{cite web |url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=35490469 |title=Central District Public Transportation Project |author=Miroslava de Nevo, Project Team Leader; Vera Lucía Vicentini, Alejandro Taddia, Carlos Mojica, and Caterina Vecco (INE/TSP); Trinidad Zamora (TSP/CHO); Irma Liliam Castillo, Xiomara Hernández, and Fabio Gordillo (consultants); Miguel Orellana (PDP/CHO); and Juan Carlos Pérez Segnini (LEG/SGO). |publisher=Inter-American Development Bank |date=2010-11-08 |access-date=2011-07-16 |archive-date=30 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930133638/http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=35490469 |url-status=live }}</ref> There is an overflow of public transportation vehicles on the roads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2010/09/23/Noticias/Buses-y-taxis-causan-caos-vial-en-Tegucigalpa |title=''Spanish:'' Buses and taxis create road chaos in Tegucigalpa |publisher=elHeraldo.hn |date=2010-09-23 |access-date=2011-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929172330/http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2010/09/23/Noticias/Buses-y-taxis-causan-caos-vial-en-Tegucigalpa |archive-date=2010-09-29 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The government has declared its public transportation system to be oversupplied and inefficient.<ref name="public transport"/>

There is a project under construction to give the public transportation system an upgrade with the addition of a [[Metrobus (Tegucigalpa)|bus rapid transit]] fleet. In late May 2011, the National Congress approved the project under a new law as part of the financing deal with the Inter-American Development Bank (IAB).{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} The BRT system will be solely managed by the Central District government.

===National and international ground transportation===
Tegucigalpa is connected with the rest of the country through its city to city bus services. There are several bus lines connecting the capital with the rest of Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/honduras/tegucigalpa/transport/getting-there-away |title=Getting there & away |author=BBC Worldwide-Lonely Planet |publisher=lonelyplanet.com |date=2010-08-23 |access-date=2011-07-16 |archive-date=11 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111154149/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/honduras/tegucigalpa/transport/getting-there-away |url-status=live }}</ref> There is no central bus terminal in the city; in turn, there are several bus stations scattered throughout the city, particularly in Comayagüela, and some of these stations are operated directly by the bus company serving from there.

[[File:Aerial view of Tegucigalpa 2008-12-14 02.jpg|thumb|View from aircraft as it banks sharply to align with runway on final approach. Las Hadas residential neighborhood lies below.]]
[[File:757landing-toncontin.jpg|thumb|An [[American Airlines]] [[Boeing 757]] landing at Toncontín International Airport]]
Toncontín International Airport ([[IATA]]: '''TGU''', [[ICAO]]: '''MHTG''') formerly served as the main airport in and out of Tegucigalpa. The airport was frequently criticized as being dangerous due to its location next to a [[Mountain range|sierra]], short runway, and difficult approach. Large commercial jets are required to execute a tight hairpin left turn at very low altitude to land on the short runway. International airline pilots flying into Toncontín receive additional training for the Toncontín approach.

Toncontín was improved by the work of the Airport Corporation of Tegucigalpa (CAT), which is owned by [[TACA Airlines|TACA]] of El Salvador. It is managed by [[InterAirports]], the company hired by the government of Honduras to manage the four airports in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interairports.hn/ |title=''Spanish:'' Airports of Honduras |author=Interairports, S.A. |publisher=InterAirports.hn |date=2007-05-13 |access-date=2011-07-16 |archive-date=21 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721094752/http://www.interairports.hn/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

All international flights are expected to move there, leaving Toncontín with only domestic flights.

=== Definitions ===
{{Refbegin}}
{{note|tegus|[a]}}'''Tegucigalpa''' refers to the urban area formed east of the Choluteca River when distinguished from Comayagüela. When broadly speaking to refer to the capital of the country, it includes Comayagüela and vice versa.

{{note|comayagüela|[b]}}'''Comayagüela''' refers to the urban area formed west of the Choluteca River. Once a city of its own, it was incorporated as part of Tegucigalpa on September 28, 1890.

{{note|cd|[c]}}'''Central District''' refers to the entire municipality containing both Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela. As established by the Constitution of Honduras, it serves as national capital and therefore its limits as government seat are not reduced to the urban area formed by Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela but extend to the entire municipality; in turn, the Central District as a whole, is the capital of Honduras.

The Central District is not a [[federal district]] since it is not an entity outside the departments of Honduras (e.g. [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Mexico City]]); it is one of the municipalities making up the Department of Francisco Morazán.
