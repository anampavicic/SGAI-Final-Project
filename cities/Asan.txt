==Transportation==
The city of Asan shares a station for the [[KTX]] high speed trains with the directly adjacent city of [[Cheonan]], which is thusly named [[Cheonan-Asan Station]]. It takes about 30&nbsp;minutes to travel from Asan to Seoul by the KTX train. It can be reached within 2 hours from [[Incheon International Airport]] by car. [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] extended one of its lines to service Asan on 15 December 2008. Two major highways, the [[Gyeongbu Expressway|Seoul-Busan]] and [[Seohaean Expressway|West Coast expressways]], also pass through Asan city.
==Economy==
It is the largest manufacturing base in Chungnam. [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung Electronics' semiconductor division Onyang Campus]], [[Samsung Display|Samsung Display's]] Asan Campus (formerly Tangjeong Campus) and Corning Precision Materials are located in Tangjeong, and in Inju-myeon, Hyundai's Asan Plant and the surrounding Inju Industrial Complex are active in automotive manufacturing. 

Samsung Electronics and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai Motor]], as well as [[Hyundai Mobis]], [[KCC Corporation|KCC]], and Hanwha Group. In addition to the large factories, Asan is also home to many medium-sized companies, including Sindorico, HL Mando, Yusung Corporation, [[Nongshim]], and Dongseong Pharmaceuticals.

Agriculture is present, but its share has been declining over the years, and unlike its neighbours [[Cheonan]], [[Seosan]], [[Gongju]], it does not have a standout speciality. Rice is the most prolific speciality, with sweet potatoes, potatoes, soybeans, wheat, barley, corn, Chinese cabbage, cucumbers, tomatoes, tomatoes, green onions, pears, grapes, and apples, and radishes, carrots, ginseng, and leaf tobacco are also grown, but not as much as the previous ones.

The livestock industry is active due to the development of hilly terrain suitable for livestock farming, and as in other regions, there is a trend of increasing scale and professionalisation, with fewer small-scale livestock farmers but more animals. 

In terms of fisheries, fishing and salt-making used to take place along the coast of Asan Bay, but after the construction of the Asan Bay Sea Wall and the Sapgyo Creek Sea Wall, fishing gradually declined and salt-making disappeared. Today, inland fishing is mainly based on Asan Lake, and eel farming is carried out in Sinchang-myeon and Seonjang-myeon. 

==Companies with factories in Asan-si==
Companies like [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai Motor]], [[Samsung LED|Samsung LCD]], and [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung Electronic]] have factories in Asan. A total of 14 industrial complexes are currently occupied by auto parts, electronic parts and other factories.

The [[Port of Pyeongtaek-Dangjin|Port of Pyeongtaek]], closest to the [[east China]] coast among Korean ports, is nearby.
