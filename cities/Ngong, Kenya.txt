'''Ngong''' is a town near the [[Ngong Hills]] along the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] within [[Kajiado County]], located in the southwest of [[Nairobi]], in southern [[Kenya]].

The word ''"Ngong"'' is a [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word derived from the word "enkong'u" meaning both "the 'eye'" and "''eye of water''" or thus ''spring'' of water.  The original place name is ''ɛnkɔŋʉ́ ɛ́ mʉny'', literally ''the eye of the rhinoceros'' but functionally ''Rhinoceros Spring''; an alternative name is ''ɔlchɔ́rrɔ ɛ́ mʉny'' (''olchorro'' is a synonymn of ''enkong'u''). ''Ngong'' is the anglicization of ''ɛnkɔŋʉ́''.  Seemingly the British found ''enkong'u e muñ'' too difficult to pronounce. A widespread [[false etymology]] is linked with the knuckle shape of the hills.

The Ngong Hills, (known to the Maasai as 'Oloolaiser") from the eastside slopes, overlook the [[Nairobi National Park]] game reserve and, off to the north, the city of [[Nairobi]].  The Ngong Hills, from the westward slopes, overlook the Great Rift Valley dropping over 4,000 feet below, where nomadic [[Maasai people|Maasai]] live.
