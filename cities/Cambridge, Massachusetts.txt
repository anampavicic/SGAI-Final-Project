Founded in December 1630 during the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]], Cambridge was one among the first cities established in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and it went on to play a historic role during the [[American Revolution]].

In May 1775, approximately 16,000 [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American patriots]] assembled in [[Cambridge Common]] to begin organizing a military retaliation against [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British troops]] following the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. On July 2, 1775, two weeks after the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]] formally established the [[Continental Army]] and appointed [[George Washington]] commander of it, Washington arrived at Cambridge Common to take command of the Patriot soldiers camped there. Many of these soldiers played a role in supporting Washington's successful [[Siege of Boston]], which trapped garrisoned British troops from moving by land, forcing the British to ultimately abandon Boston. Cambridge Common is thus celebrated as the birthplace of the Continental Army.<ref>[https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/washington-takes-command-of-continental-army "July 3, 1775: George Washington takes command of Continental Army"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230220171517/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/washington-takes-command-of-continental-army |date=February 20, 2023 }}, History.com</ref><ref>[https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/cambridge/ "Cambridge"], George Washington's Mount Vernon website</ref>

===Pre-colonization===
The [[Massachusett]] inhabited the area that is now called Cambridge for thousands of years prior to [[European colonization of the Americas]], most recently under the name ''Anmoughcawgen'', which means 'fishing weir' or 'beaver dam' in [[Massachusett language|Natick]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=You live in Anmoughcawgen |url=https://historycambridge.org/articles/you-live-in-anmoughcawgen/ |access-date=2023-09-28 |website=History Cambridge |language=en-US}}</ref> At the time of European contact, the area was inhabited by [[Naumkeag people|Naumkeag]] or [[Pawtucket tribe|Pawtucket]] to the north and [[Massachusett]] to the south, and may have been inhabited by other groups such as the Totant, not well described in later European narratives.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=John|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100693021|title=A description of New England; or, The observations, and discoveries of Captain Iohn Smith (admirall of that country) in the north of America, in the year of our Lord 1614; with the successe of sixe ships, that went the next yeare 1615; and the accidents befell him among the French men of warre: with the proofe of the present benefit this countrey affoords; whither this present yeare, 1616, eight voluntary ships are gone to make further tryall.|date=1837|publisher=P.

===17th century and colonialism===
In December 1630, the site of present-day Cambridge was chosen for settlement because it was safely upriver from [[Boston Harbor]], making it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. The city was founded by [[Thomas Dudley]], his daughter [[Anne Bradstreet]], and his son-in-law [[Simon Bradstreet]]. The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as "the newe towne".{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}<ref name="abbott1880">{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Rev.

Located at the first convenient [[Charles River]] crossing west of [[Boston]], Newtowne was one of several towns, including Boston, [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]], founded by the 700 original [[Puritans|Puritan]] colonists of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] under Governor [[John Winthrop]]. Its first preacher was [[Thomas Hooker]], who led many of its original inhabitants west in 1636 to found [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and the [[Connecticut Colony]]; before leaving, they sold their plots to more recent immigrants from England.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The original village site is now within [[Harvard Square]]. The [[Farmers' market|marketplace]] where farmers sold crops from surrounding towns at the edge of a salt marsh (since filled) remains within a small park at the corner of John F. Kennedy and Winthrop Streets.

In 1636, Newe College, later renamed [[Harvard College]] after benefactor [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], was founded as [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|North America's first institution of higher learning]]. Its initial purpose was training [[minister (religion)|ministers]]. According to [[Cotton Mather]], Newtowne was chosen for the site of the college by the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court]], then the legislature of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], primarily for its proximity to the popular and highly respected Puritan preacher [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]].

Cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} by road from Boston, the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colony]]'s capital. By the [[American Revolution]], most residents lived near the [[Cambridge Common|Common]] and Harvard College, with most of the town comprising farms and estates. Most inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of [[Anglicans|Anglican]] "worthies" who were not involved in village life, made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along "the Road to Watertown", present-day [[Brattle Street (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Brattle Street]], which is still known as [[Tory Row]].

===18th century and Revolutionary War===
The [[Colony of Virginia|Virginian]]  [[George Washington]], coming from [[Second Continental Congress|Philadelphia]], took command of the force of [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] soldiers camped on [[Cambridge Common]] on July 3, 1775, which is now considered the birthplace of the [[Continental Army]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}{{efn|The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.}}

On January 24, 1776, [[Henry Knox]] arrived with an [[Noble train of artillery|artillery train]] captured from [[Fort Ticonderoga]], which allowed Washington to force the [[British Army]] to [[Siege of Boston|evacuate Boston]]. Most of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] estates in Cambridge were confiscated after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].

===19th century and industrialization===
Between 1790 and 1840, Cambridge grew rapidly with the construction of [[West Boston Bridge]] in 1792 connecting Cambridge directly to [[Boston]], making it no longer necessary to travel {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Boston Neck]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to cross the [[Charles River]]. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new [[Middlesex Canal]]. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential districts.

In the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution. It was home to some of the famous [[Fireside poets]], named because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. The Fireside poets, including [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], were highly popular and influential in this era.

Soon after, [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were built: the [[Cambridge and Concord Turnpike]] (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]] (Hampshire St. and [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Ave.]] northwest of [[Porter Square]]), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets connected various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, the town was connected to the [[Boston & Maine Railroad]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=96}} leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] from the formerly rural parts of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].

Cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The city's commercial center began to shift from Harvard Square to Central Square, which became the city's downtown around that time.

Between 1850 and 1900, Cambridge took on much of its present character, featuring [[streetcar suburb]]an development along the turnpikes and [[working class]] and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge, comfortable middle-class housing on the old Cambridgeport, and Mid-Cambridge estates and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills. The arrival of the railroad in North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge led to three changes: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]], [[Concord Avenue (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Concord Avenue]], and [[Alewife Brook]]; the ice-cutting industry launched by [[Frederic Tudor]] on [[Fresh Pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Fresh Pond]]; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to house the thousands of immigrants who arrived to work in the new industries.

For much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the city's largest employer was the [[New England Glass Company]], founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century, it was the world's largest and most modern glassworks. In 1888, [[Edward Libbey|Edward Drummond Libbey]] moved all production to [[Toledo, Ohio]], where it continues today under the name [[Owens-Illinois]]. The company's flint glassware with heavy lead content is prized by antique glass collectors, and the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] has a large collection. The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston and the Sandwich Glass Museum on [[Cape Cod]] also house several pieces.

In 1895, [[Edwin Ginn]], founder of [[Ginn and Company]], built the [[Athenaeum Press]] Building for his publishing textbook empire.

===20th century===
By 1920, Cambridge was one of [[New England]]'s main industrial cities, with nearly 120,000 residents. Among the largest businesses in Cambridge during the period of industrialization was [[Carter's Ink Company]], whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the world's largest ink manufacturer. Next door was the Athenaeum Press.  Confectionery and snack manufacturers in the Cambridgeport-Area 4-Kendall corridor included Kennedy Biscuit Factory, later part of [[Nabisco]] and originator of the [[Fig Newton]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM55Y9_Kennedy_F_A_Steam_Bakery_Cambridge_MA |title=Kennedy, F.

In 1935, the Cambridge Housing Authority and the [[Public Works Administration]] demolished an [[Housing segregation in the United States|integrated]] low-income [[tenement]] neighborhood with African Americans and European immigrants. In its place, it built the whites-only "'''Newtowne Court'''" [[Subsidized housing in the United States|public housing development]] and the adjoining, blacks-only "'''Washington Elms'''" project in 1940; the city required segregation in its other public housing projects as well.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rothstein|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Rothstein|title=The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America|title-link=The Color of Law|year=2017|place=New York|publisher=[[Boni & Liveright|Liveright Publishing Corporation]]|page=26|isbn=978-1631494536}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cambridge Housing Authority - Newtowne Court|publisher=Cambridge Housing Authority|url=http://www.cambridge-housing.org/housing/directory/family/newtowne.asp|access-date=July 23, 2020|archive-date=July 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723074112/http://www.cambridge-housing.org/housing/directory/family/newtowne.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cambridge Housing Authority – Washington Elms|publisher=Cambridge Housing Authority|url=http://www.cambridge-housing.org/housing/directory/family/washingtonelms.asp|access-date=July 23, 2020|archive-date=July 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723072631/http://www.cambridge-housing.org/housing/directory/family/washingtonelms.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As industry in [[New England]] began to decline during the [[Great Depression]] and after [[World War II]], Cambridge lost much of its industrial base. It also began to become an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. [[Harvard University]], which had always been important as both a landowner and an institution, began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. When Radcliffe College was established in 1879, the town became a mecca for some of the nation's most academically talented female students. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s move from [[Boston]] to Cambridge in 1916 reinforced Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.

After the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. In Cambridge Highlands, the technology company [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek, & Newman]] produced [[Interface Message Processor|the first network router]] in 1969 and hosted the invention of computer-to-computer email in 1971. The 1980s brought a wave of high technology startups. Those selling advanced [[minicomputer]]s were overtaken by the [[microcomputer]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Featherly |first=Kevin |date=15 July 2024 |title=ARPANET: United States defense program |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET#ref1232401 |access-date=10 August 2024 |website=Britannica}}</ref>  Cambridge-based [[VisiCorp]] made the first [[spreadsheet]] software for personal computers, [[VisiCalc]], and helped propel the [[Apple II]] to consumer success. It was overtaken and purchased by Cambridge-based [[Lotus Development]], maker of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] (which was, in turn, replaced in by [[Microsoft Excel]]).

The city continues to be home to many startups. Kendall Square was a software hub through the [[dot-com boom]] and today hosts offices of such technology companies as Google, [[Microsoft]], and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]. The Square also now houses the headquarters of [[Akamai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/locations.jsp |title=Locations – Akamai |website=Akamai.com |access-date=May 25, 2018 |archive-date=May 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520010648/https://www.akamai.com/us/en/locations.jsp |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1976, Harvard's plans to start experiments with [[recombinant DNA]] led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel. In the end, Cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977. This led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when [[Biogen]] opened a lab in 1982, in contrast to the hostility that caused the Genetic Institute, a Harvard spinoff, to abandon [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and Boston for Cambridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/17/how-cambridge-became-the-life-sciences-capital/|title=How Cambridge became the life sciences capital|website=www.betaboston.com|access-date=August 18, 2016|archive-date=September 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925065657/http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/17/how-cambridge-became-the-life-sciences-capital/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in Cambridge, which now includes headquarters for Biogen and [[Genzyme]]; laboratories for [[Novartis]], [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], [[Alnylam Pharmaceuticals|Alnylam]], [[Ironwood Pharmaceuticals|Ironwood]], Catabasis, [[Moderna Therapeutics]], [[Editas Medicine]]; support companies such as [[Cytel]]; and many smaller companies.

====Rent control====
{{see also|Rent control in Massachusetts#Cambridge decisions}}
During the era of [[rent control in Massachusetts]], at least 20 percent of all rent controlled apartments in Cambridge housed the rich.<ref name=move>{{cite web | url = https://rentcontrolhistory.com/chapters/renters-who-needed-to-move-couldnt-qualify/ | title = Renters who needed to move couldn't qualify. | publisher = Mass Landlords, Inc | accessdate = January 3, 2024 }}</ref> The vast majority housed middle- and high-income earners.{{r|move}} In an independent study conducted of 2/3 of the rent controlled apartments in Cambridge in 1988, 246 were households headed by doctors, 298 by lawyers, 265 by architects, 259 by professors, and 220 by engineers. There were 2,650 with students, including 1,503 with graduate students.{{r|move}}

Those who lived in rent controlled apartments included

*[[Frederik X|Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark]]{{r|lease|move}}

The end of rent control in 1994 had [[Rent control in Massachusetts#Impact on Cambridge|numerous effects on the city]]. Within four years of repealing the law, Cambridge, where "the city's form of rent control was unusually strict," saw new housing and construction increase by 50%, and the tax revenue from construction permits tripled.<ref name=lease>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/09/19/mass-city-gets-a-new-lease-on-life/9b8249b7-a1d1-4b6c-a4e7-a305c9dcb833/ | title = Mass.

== Geography ==
[[File:Charles River Cambridge USA.jpg|thumb|A winter view of Cambridge and [[Harvard University]]'s [[Weld Boathouse]] seen from [[Boston]] with the [[Charles River]] in the foreground]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], Cambridge has a total area of {{convert|7.1|sqmi|km2}}, {{convert|6.4|sqmi|km2}} of which is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (9.82%) of which is water.

=== Adjacent municipalities ===
Cambridge is located in eastern Massachusetts, bordered by:
* the city of [[Boston]] to the south and east (across the Charles River)
* the city of [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] to the north
* the town of [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]] to the northwest
* the town of [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] and
* the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] to the west

The border between Cambridge and the neighboring city of Somerville passes through densely populated neighborhoods, which are connected by the [[Red Line (MBTA)|MBTA Red Line]]. Some of the main squares, [[Inman Square|Inman]], Porter, and to a lesser extent, Harvard and [[Lechmere Square|Lechmere]], are very close to the city line, as are Somerville's [[Union Square (Somerville)|Union]] and [[Davis Square]]s.

Through the City of Cambridge's exclusive municipal water system, the city further controls two [[exclave]] areas, one being Payson Park Reservoir and Gatehouse, a [[American and Canadian Water Landmark|2009 listed American Water Landmark]] located roughly one mile west of Fresh Pond and surrounded by the town of Belmont.  The second area is the larger Hobbs Brook and [[Stony Brook (Middlesex County, Massachusetts)|Stony Brook]] watersheds, which share borders with neighboring towns and cities including Lexington, [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]], [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] and [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]].

The port is usually the busier part of the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cambridge.wickedlocal.com/article/20151020/NEWS/151029350 |title=Area Four in Cambridge renamed 'The Port' |last=Handy |first=Natalie |newspaper=Wicked Local |access-date=March 20, 2016 |archive-date=March 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321114051/http://cambridge.wickedlocal.com/article/20151020/NEWS/151029350 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Architecture ===
Despite intensive urbanization during the late 19th century and the 20th century, Cambridge has several historic buildings, including some from the 17th century. The city also has abundant contemporary architecture, largely built by Harvard and MIT.

=== Parks and recreation ===
[[File:Alewife Brook Reservation.jpg|thumb|[[Alewife Brook Reservation]]]]
Consisting largely of densely built residential space, Cambridge lacks significant tracts of public parkland. Easily accessible open space on the university campuses, including [[Harvard Yard]], Radcliffe Yard, and MIT's Great Lawn, as well as the considerable open space of [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] and [[Fresh Pond (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Fresh Pond]] Reservation, partly compensates for this. At Cambridge's western edge, the cemetery is known as a garden cemetery because of its landscaping (the oldest planned landscape in the country) and [[arboretum]]. Although known as a Cambridge landmark, much of the cemetery lies within Watertown.<ref>{{cite web |title=City of Cambridge map |publisher=City of Cambridge |year=2007 |url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CambridgeStreetMap18x24_032007.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221010/http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CambridgeStreetMap18x24_032007.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-10 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is also an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) in the Greater Boston area. Fresh Pond Reservation is the largest open green space in Cambridge with 162 acres (656,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of land around a 155-acre (627,000 m<sup>2</sup>) [[kettle hole]] lake. This land includes a 2.25-mile walking trail around the reservoir and a public nine-hole golf course.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Master Plan – Water – City of Cambridge, Massachusetts|url=https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/freshpondreservation/aboutfreshpond/masterplandescription|access-date=2020-10-27|website=www.cambridgema.gov|archive-date=November 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101084825/https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/freshpondreservation/aboutfreshpond/masterplandescription|url-status=live}}</ref>

Public parkland includes the esplanade along the [[Charles River]], which mirrors its [[Charles River Esplanade|Boston counterpart]], [[Cambridge Common]], [[Danehy Park]], and [[Alewife Brook Reservation]].

Cambridge is split between Massachusetts's [[Massachusetts's 5th congressional district|5th]] and [[Massachusetts's 7th congressional district|7th]] U.S. congressional districts. The 5th district seat is held by Democrat [[Katherine Clark]], who replaced now-Senator [[Ed Markey]] in a [[Massachusetts's 5th congressional district special election, 2013|2013 special election]]; the 7th is represented by Democrat [[Ayanna Pressley]], elected in 2018. The state's senior [[United States Senate|United States senator]] is Democrat [[Elizabeth Warren]], elected in 2012, who lives in Cambridge. The governor of Massachusetts is Democrat [[Maura Healey]], elected in 2022.

Cambridge is represented in six districts in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]]: the 24th Middlesex (which includes parts of Belmont and Arlington), the 25th and 26th Middlesex (the latter of which includes a portion of Somerville), the 29th Middlesex (which includes a small part of Watertown), and the Eighth and Ninth Suffolk (both including parts of the City of Boston).<ref name=cambridgeGIS>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/gis/gisdatadictionary/elections/elections_staterepdistricts.aspx |work=Geographic Information System |publisher=City of Cambridge |title=State Rep Districts |access-date=July 1, 2014 |archive-date=July 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725170759/http://www.cambridgema.gov/gis/gisdatadictionary/elections/elections_staterepdistricts.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is represented in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] as a part of the [[Massachusetts Senate's 2nd Middlesex district|2nd Middlesex]], [[Massachusetts Senate's Middlesex and Suffolk district|Middlesex and Suffolk]], and [[Massachusetts Senate's 1st Suffolk and Middlesex district|1st Suffolk and Middlesex]] districts.<ref name=Acts2011>{{citation |url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2011/Chapter152 |access-date=August 5, 2020 |work=Session Laws: Acts (2011) |title=An Act Establishing Executive Councillor and Senatorial Districts |author=Massachusetts General Court |archive-date=March 31, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331163214/https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2011/Chapter152 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Politics===
From 1860 to 1880, Republicans [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], and [[James Garfield]] each won Cambridge, Grant doing so by margins of over 20 points in both of his campaigns. Following that, from 1884 to 1892, [[Grover Cleveland]] won Cambridge in all three of his presidential campaigns, by less than ten points each time.

Then from 1896 to 1924, Cambridge became something of a swing city with a slight Republican lean. Republican candidates carried the city in five of the eight presidential elections during that time, with five of the elections resulting in either a plurality or a margin of victory of fewer than ten points.
 
In modern times, however, Cambridge has been a stronghold of the Democratic Party. In the last 23 presidential elections, dating back to the nomination of [[Al Smith]] in the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]], Democratic presidential candidates have won Cambridge with every Democratic nominee since Massachusetts native [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] receiving at least 70% of the vote, except for [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 and 1980. Since 1928, the only Republican nominee to come within ten points of carrying Cambridge is [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in his 1956 reelection bid.

===City government ===
{{anchor|govt}}
[[File:CambridgeMACityHall1.jpg|thumb|[[City Hall (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Cambridge City Hall]] in the 1980s]]
Cambridge has a city government led by a [[List of mayors of Cambridge, Massachusetts|mayor]] and a nine-member city council. There is also a six-member school committee that functions alongside the superintendent of public schools. The councilors and school committee members are elected every two years using [[Single transferable vote|proportional representation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/electioncommission/cambridgemunicipalelections |title=Cambridge Municipal Elections |publisher=City of Cambridge |access-date=September 19, 2017 |archive-date=September 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044049/http://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/electioncommission/cambridgemunicipalelections |url-status=live }}</ref>

The mayor is elected by the city councilors from among themselves and serves as the chair of city council meetings. The mayor also sits on the school committee. The mayor is not the city's chief executive. Rather, the city manager, who is appointed by the city council, serves in that capacity.

Under the city's Plan E form of government, the city council does not have the power to appoint or remove city officials who are under the direction of the city manager. The city council and its members are also forbidden from giving orders to any subordinate of the city manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/planE.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221010/http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/planE.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-10 |url-status=live |publisher=City of Cambridge |title=Plan E}}</ref>

Yi-An Huang is the City Manager as of September 6, 2022, succeeding Owen O'Riordan (now the Deputy City Manager) who briefly served as the Acting City Manager after Louis DePasquale resigned on July 5, 2022, after six years in office.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/07/18/next-city-manager-transition-will-come-sept-6-huang-arriving-in-office-after-summer-of-prep/ | title=Next city manager transition is set for Sept. 6: Huang arriving in office after summer of prep | publisher=Cambridge Day | date=2022-07-08 | access-date=2022-07-24 | archive-date=July 24, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220724103216/https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/07/18/next-city-manager-transition-will-come-sept-6-huang-arriving-in-office-after-summer-of-prep/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

=== County government ===
Cambridge was a [[county seat]] of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], along with Lowell, until the abolition of executive county government. Though the county government was abolished in 1997, the county still exists as a geographical and political region. The employees of Middlesex County courts, jails, registries, and other county agencies now work directly for the state. The county's registrars of [[Deed]]s and Probate remain in Cambridge, but the Superior Court and District Attorney have had their operations transferred to [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]]. Third District Court has shifted operations to [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], and the county Sheriff's office awaits near-term relocation.<ref>(1) {{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/02/14/court_move_a_hassle_for_commuters/ |title=Court move a hassle for commuters |access-date=July 25, 2009 |first=Eric |last=Moskowitz |date=February 14, 2008 |work=[[Boston Globe]] |quote=In a little more than a month, Middlesex Superior Court will open in Woburn after nearly four decades at the Edward J.

Cambridge Community Television (CCTV) has served the city since its inception in 1988. CCTV operates Cambridge's public access television facility and three television channels, 8, 9, and 96, on the XFinity cable system (Comcast). The city has invited tenders from other cable providers, but Comcast remains its only fixed television and broadband utility,<ref>(1) {{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/consumercouncil/cambridgecableinformation.aspx |title=Cable Television in the City of Cambridge |year=2013 |work=Cambridge Consumers' Council |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508210917/http://www.cambridgema.gov/consumercouncil/cambridgecableinformation.aspx |archive-date=May 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 3, 2013 |quote=Comcast is currently the only cable operator that has sought a license with Cambridge.

==== Road ====
[[File:Harvard Square at Peabody Street and Mass Avenue.jpg|thumb|[[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in [[Harvard Square]]]]
Cambridge is served by several major roads, including [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]], [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], and the [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]]. The [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] does not pass through Cambridge but is accessible by an exit in nearby [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]. Both [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] and [[Interstate 93]] provide additional access at the eastern end of Cambridge via Leverett Circle in Boston. [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]] runs the length of the city, chiefly along Massachusetts Avenue. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges connecting Cambridge to Boston, eight of which are open to motorized road traffic, including the [[Longfellow Bridge]] and the [[Harvard Bridge]].

Cambridge has an irregular street network because many of the roads date from the colonial era. Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baker |first=Matthew Reed |date=2018-03-06 |title=Are Boston's Streets Really Paved Over Cow Paths? |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2018/03/06/boston-streets-cow-paths/ |access-date=2024-06-05 |website=Boston Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> Today, the major "squares" are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] between [[Harvard Square]] and [[Central Square, Cambridge|Central Square]] or Hampshire Street between [[Kendall Square]] and [[Inman Square]].

On October 25, 2022, Cambridge City Council voted 8–1 to eliminate [[Parking mandates|parking minimums]] from the city code, citing declining car ownership, with the aim of promoting housing construction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cambridge Becomes First Massachusetts City to Fully Abolish Parking Minimums {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/25/cambridge-parking/ |access-date=2023-07-01 |website=www.thecrimson.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Dana |last=Gerber |date=October 26, 2022 |title=No more parking mandates at new buildings in Cambridge |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/25/business/no-more-parking-mandates-new-buildings-cambridge/ |access-date=2023-07-01 |website=BostonGlobe.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

The Harvard bus tunnel under [[Harvard Square]] connects to the Red Line underground. This tunnel was originally opened for streetcars in 1912 and served trackless trolleys, [[trolleybus]]es, and buses as the routes were converted; four lines of the [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston|MBTA trolleybus system]] continued to use it until their conversion to diesel in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/03/11/cambridge-trackless-trolleys-to-retire-this-weekend-as-the-technology-nears-extinction|title=Cambridge trackless trolleys to retire this weekend as the technology nears extinction|date=March 11, 2022|website=Wgbh.org|access-date=October 19, 2022|archive-date=September 22, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220922091206/https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/03/11/cambridge-trackless-trolleys-to-retire-this-weekend-as-the-technology-nears-extinction|url-status=live}}</ref> The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s.
