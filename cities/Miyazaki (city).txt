==History==
The area of Miyazaki was part of ancient [[Hyūga Province]]. In 1551, a merchant market town called Jogasaki was established on the south bank of the Ōyodo River near Akae port, and flourished due to trade along the [[Seto Inland Sea]] with the [[Kinai region]]. This settlement came under the control of [[Obi Domain]] ruled by the [[Itō clan]] in the [[Edo period]], although much of the rest of the area which is now within the city borders was a patchwork of feudal holdings ruled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] as well as [[Sadowara Domain]], [[Satsuma Domain]] and others. With the [[abolition of the han system]] in 1871, the Ōyodo River was the border between "Mimitsu Prefecture" and "Miyakonojo Prefecture". When these prefectures were merged in 1873 to form Miyazaki Prefecture, a site near the geographic center was selected as the new capital, and this was the hamlet of Kitta-Beppu, located near the old settlement of Jogasaki. The town of Miyazaki was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. After the completion of the nationwide railroad system, many new people began to settle in the area.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=592–594|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

Miyazaki merged with the neighbouring town of Ōyodo and village of Ōmiya, and was raised to city status on April 1, 1924.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.miyazaki.miyazaki.jp/gyousei/html/univ/en/index.html |title=Miyazaki City Official Website |access-date=2014-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015063426/http://www.city.miyazaki.miyazaki.jp/gyousei/html/univ/en/index.html |archive-date=2014-10-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On April 1, 1998, Miyazaki was designated a [[Core cities of Japan]], giving it greater local autonomy.

On January 1, 2006, the towns of [[Sadowara, Miyazaki|Sadowara]] and [[Tano, Miyazaki|Tano]] (both from [[Miyazaki District, Miyazaki|Miyazaki District]]), and the town of [[Takaoka, Miyazaki|Takaoka]] (from [[Higashimorokata District, Miyazaki|Higashimorokata District]]) were merged into Miyazaki.

On March 23, 2010, the town of [[Kiyotake, Miyazaki|Kiyotake]] (from [[Miyazaki District, Miyazaki|Miyazaki District]]) was merged into Miyazaki. Miyazaki District was dissolved as a result of this merger.<ref name="Plannedmerge">{{cite web |url=http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/kyusyu/45.htm |title=市町村合併情報 宮崎県 ＜国土地理協会＞ |access-date=2008-09-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629153802/http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/kyusyu/45.htm |archive-date=2007-06-29 }}</ref>

==Government==
Miyazaki has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 40 members. Miyazaki contributes 12 members to the Miyazaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Miyazaki 1st district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
[[File:Downtown of Miyazaki City01.jpg|thumb|200px|Downtown of Miyazaki]]
Miyazaki is primary a regional commercial center. Although eastern Miyazaki is designated as the "Miyazaki SUN Technopolis area", there is no large-scale industry in Miyazaki City as the city is hampered by poor transportation and logistics connections with other areas of Japan. In recent years, the city has been actively attracting the information industry. Rural parts of the city are still agricultural, cultivation of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and other crops, and food processing factories. [[Solaseed Air]], a regional airline, has its head office in Miyazaki.
