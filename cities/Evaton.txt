'''Evaton''' is a [[township (South Africa)|township]] north of [[Sebokeng]], that's divided into three; Evaton Central, Evaton West (popularily  known as "Mkhelele") and Evaton North, in the [[Emfuleni Local Municipality]] of [[Gauteng]], [[South Africa]]. It was established in [[1904 in South Africa|1904]]. Like other townships in the area, Evaton was affected by the violent unrest which erupted in [[1984 in South Africa|1984]] and by [[1985 in South Africa|1985]] a state of emergency was imposed.

Extensive information on this township is available in the book by Patrick Noonan called ''They're Burning the Churches'' (Jacana Media). {{Cn|date=May 2024}}

==Neighbouring townships==

Neighbouring townships include [[Sebokeng]],  [[Orange Farm]], [[Boipatong]], [[Sharpeville]], Small Farms, Boitumelo, Polokong, Golden Gardens, Palm Springs and Lakeside.

==Evaton Renewal Project==
The Evaton Renewal Project is a project of government aimed at “renewing” or regenerating Evaton, to improve the quality of life of the Evaton community. The priority areas of this project include: the development of infrastructure, such as the resurfacing of roads and building of pavements; the development of the local economy through job creation and Small, Micro and Medium Enterprise (SMME) projects, like grass-cutting and the setting up of vegetable gardens and [[small-scale agriculture]]. The project has since proven to be a complete disaster/failure. The leadership in this region of the country is self-serving.
