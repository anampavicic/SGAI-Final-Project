'''Choluteca''' is a municipality and the capital city of the [[Departments of Honduras|Honduran department]] of the [[Choluteca (department)|same name]].  Situated in southern [[Honduras]] between [[El Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]], the city is generally considered the regional centre of southern Honduras and is a major transit point on the Pan-American Highway.  It has a major bus station and is home to the regional light (ENEE) and water (SANAA) utilities.  The city is located on the [[Choluteca River]],<ref name="FAO">{{cite web | title=Honduras – Geografía y Población |url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/honduras/indexesp.stm |publisher=FAO | access-date=25 May 2009|year=2000}}</ref> near the centre of the department.  An arching silver bridge crosses the river into the city.

Choluteca's population of 99,980 (2023 calculation)<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/honduras/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of the major cities in Honduras</ref> makes it the seventh largest city in the country.  It is the only major Honduran city on the [[Pan-American Highway]].  It is considered to be the second-hottest city in Honduras after [[Nacaome]].

==History==
When Spanish [[conquistadors]] arrived in southern [[Honduras]] in 1535, the [[Mangue language|Chorotega]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] inhabited the area. In 1541, a town was founded there by Captain Cristobál de la Cueva which was known as Villa de Xerez de la Frontera de Choluteca.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Larde|first=Jorge|last2=Larín|first2=Jorge|year=1978|title=TOPONIMIA CENTROAMERICANA (CHOLUTECA, MANALACO Y CHOROTEGA)|jstor=25661655|journal=Anuario De Estudios Centroamericanos|volume=4|pages=207–217}}</ref> The conquistadors had a practice of establishing colonies in their territories in strategic locations to dominate and take over the land from the indigenous people.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Honduras: Religiosidad Popular, Raiz de la Identidad|last=de Oyuela|first=Leticia|publisher=Centro de Publicaciones Obispado de Choluteca|year=1995|location=Choluteca, Honduras C. A.|pages=43–47}}</ref> With the founding of Xerex de la Frontera, that strategy was used to possess a communication center with the sister republics of [[Guatemala]] and [[Nicaragua]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.angelfire.com/ca5/mas/dpmapas/cho/cho.html|title=DEPARTAMENTO DE CHOLUTECA|last=Secoff|first=Mario|website=El Libro Electronico de Honduras}}</ref> Like other parts of Honduras, the Choluteca area had many mineral deposits<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Central America: Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, and Salvador|last=Koebel|first=William Henry|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin LTD.|year=1917|location=London, England|pages=244–259}}</ref> and fertile land for agriculture, making it one of the richest colonies of Honduras for the Spanish government.

From its founding, Villa de Xerez de la Frontera depended on the Guatemalan government, but in 1580, it became part of the [[Tegucigalpa]], Honduras [[Municipalities of Honduras|municipality]]. Under the Honduran president [[Coronado Chávez]], the city was officially named “Choluteca” on October 1, 1845 by the [[National Congress of Honduras|National Congress of the Republic]].

There are many versions of Choluteca's founding. [[Federico Lunardi]] says it was established in 1535,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Honduras Maya: etnologia y arqueologia de Honduras: estudios Mayas: orientaciones|last=Lunardi|first=Federico|publisher=Secretaria privada de la Presidencia de la Republica|year=1948|location=Tegucigalpa}}</ref> Rómulo Ernesto Durón says 1533, and [[Doris Stone]] says 1540.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Central and Southern Honduras|last=Stone|first=Doris|publisher=Peabody Museum|year=1957|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}</ref> The modern historian Marxis Lenin Hernández says there is a need to investigate the real origin of Choluteca because of these discrepancies. He says that Federico Lunardi's version of the history is the most widespread.

Over the years, Choluteca has developed into one of the country's most important centers of history, culture, and commerce.

Choluteca was heavily damaged by flooding from [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998.  It received more rainfall than any other place affected by the storm – 36&nbsp;inches in only a few days. This is the amount of rain the city normally receives in 212 days.  In addition, the Choluteca River swelled to six times its normal width, putting entire neighbourhoods under water temporarily.<ref name="FAO"/> Many villages and suburbs, like [[San Ramón, Choluteca|Stevensville]], were badly damaged, suffering immense property losses and a high number of deaths.

The charity [[Solar net Village]] helped to rebuild [[San Ramón, Choluteca]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Remote Energy Systems and Rural Connectivity: Technical Assistance to the  Aldeas Solares Program of Honduras |url=https://www.esmap.org/sites/default/files/esmap-files/TR_09205HondurasAldeadSolaresForWeb.pdf |publisher=[[Energy Sector Management Assistance Program|ESMAP]] |access-date=16 January 2019 |date=December 2005}}</ref> and restored electricity in [[San Francisco, Lempira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/76569831/Lempira-Honduras|title=Lempira Honduras - Rural Electrification - Electrification|website=Scribd}}</ref>

Choluteca is one of the most productive areas of Honduras. The department raises commodity crops of sugar, [[cantaloupe]], [[watermelon]], [[okra]], and [[sweet potato]]. It also harvests [[shrimp]] and fish, and produces salt, and a few [[precious metal]]s.

[[José Cecilio del Valle]], the first President of [[United Provinces of Central America|Central America]], was born in Choluteca in 1780.  His house (Casa Valle, located on the main square) is now a cultural centre housing the local library and a tourist centre.  The house is featured on the back of the 100-[[Honduran lempira|lempira]] note.

[[Dania Prince]], [[Miss Earth 2003]] and the only Honduran to win a grandslam beauty pageant, came from Choluteca.

==Transport==
The city is served by [[Choluteca Airport]], which, as of 2022, has no commercial airline services.

==Climate==
Choluteca is one of the hottest cities of [[Honduras]] and all of [[Central America]] as well gives the city a [[Tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''Aw''); The registered high temperature of the city is {{convert|46|C|F|1}}, and the lowest is {{convert|18|C|F|1}}.
