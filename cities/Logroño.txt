'''Logroño''' ({{IPA|es|loˈɣɾoɲo|lang|Es-logroño.oga}}) is the capital of the autonomous community of [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain. Located in the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], primarily in the right (South) bank of the [[Ebro River]], Logroño has historically been a place of passage, such as the [[Camino de Santiago]]. Its borders were disputed between the Iberian kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castille]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] during the Middle Ages.
<!-- The [[IATA]] code (RJL) comes from the La Rioja-Logroño combination -->

The population of the city in 2021 was 150,808 while the metropolitan area included nearly 200,000 inhabitants. The city is a centre of trade of [[Rioja wine]], for which the area is noted, and manufacturing of wood, metal and textile products.

== Etymology ==

=== Origin of the name ===
The origin of this toponym is, as for many other places, unknown. The name ''Lucronio'' was first used in a document from 965 where [[García Sánchez I of Pamplona]] donated the so-called place to the [[Monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla|Monastery of San Millán]]. In the Fuero of Logroño from 1095 it appeared under the name ''Logronio'', except once when it was called ''illo Gronio''. The most broadly accepted theses seem to be those which indicate it is a late [[Latinisation of names|latinization]] by prefixing the article "''lo/illo''" to the old toponym ''Gronio''/''Gronno'',<ref>I. Rodríguez y R. de Lama, ''Colección diplomática medieval de La Rioja'', vol. I, Logroño 1979, 272–293</ref> a word of [[Celtic language|Celtic]] origin which means ''the ford'' or ''the pass''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} It is believed that this name was due to the frequent use of this place to cross the [[Ebro river]].

Other historians have proposed alternative theories, such as a possible derivation from ''Lucus Brun'' or ''Lucus Beronius'' ("Sacred place in the Beronian forest"), but its etymology remains unknown.<ref name="UntermannSiles1993">{{cite book|author1=Urbano Espinosa|editor1=Jürgen Untermann|editor2=Jaime Siles|title=Studia palaeohispanica et indogermanica J. Untermann ab amicis hispanicis oblata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bv7GwEcForYC&pg=PA139|year=1993|publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona|isbn=978-84-475-0418-3|page=139|chapter=El gentilicio Berones en el topónimo Logroño|quote=El gentilicio Berones en el topónimo Logroño Urbano Espinosa Logroño forma parte de un reducido grupo de topónimos mayores en la España septentrional. cuya etimología resulta inexplicable.}}</ref>

=== Titles ===
[[John II of Castile]] granted it the title of "City" on 7 February 1431 in [[Palencia]] and ratified it on 20 February in [[Valladolid]],<ref>Rolled leather parchment sealed with lead and the royal seal. Valladolid, 20 February 1431. Logroño municipal register</ref> thus it stopped being called "Village", despite there being no explicit justification of the reasons for that change. 20 July 1444 the same king added the titles of "Very noble", {{langx|es|Muy Noble}}, and "Very loyal", {{langx|es|Muy Leal}}, which up until today appear in the seal of the city. In this case, the reason was the loyalty of the habitants against the homonymous king [[John II of Aragon]], because despite the ''«long war, and wounds and deaths, and robberies, and fires, and damages and oppressions»'', the city remained loyal to the service of the king of Castile.

On 5 July 1523, the king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] granted it the three [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis]] for the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] of the city for its resistance during the French siege in 1521.

It also received by Royal Decree the title of "Excellence" 6 December 1854 from [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], as a reward for its behavior during the [[cholera]] epidemic which devastated the city.

==Geography==
Logroño is located in the northern region of [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]], on the river [[Ebro]], {{convert|384|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The [[Way of St. James|Camino de Santiago]] passes through the city. The geographical coordinates of the city are: 42° 27′ N, 2° 29′ W.

The city lies {{convert|152|km|abbr=on}} from [[Bilbao]], {{convert|172|km|abbr=on}} from [[Zaragoza]], {{convert|336|km|abbr=on}} from [[Madrid]] and {{convert|468|km|abbr=on}} from [[Barcelona]].

== History ==
Logroño was an old settlement, first of the Romans, under the name of Vareia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/246729 |title=Places: 246729 (Vareia?) |author=Keay, S. |author2=R. Mathisen |author3=H. Sivan |author4=R. Talbert|author5=T. Elliott |author6=S. Gillies |access-date=August 27, 2013<!-- 4:33 am -->|publisher=Pleiades}}</ref> a commercial port, and then of the Celts.{{dubious|date=December 2015}} From the 10th century, possession of Logroño was disputed between the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and those of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]; the region was finally annexed to [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. The name is a combination of le and Groin, mashed together as Logroño over time.  [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] granted Logroño in 1095 a charter of rights that served as a model for other Spanish cities. In 1609 and 1610 Logroño was the main seat of the [[Basque witch trials]], part of the [[Spanish Inquisition]].

Famous people from Logroño include [[Manuel Bretón de los Herreros]], [[Fausto Elhúyar]], [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]], [[Rafael Azcona]], [[Ramón Castroviejo]], [[Pedro J. Ramírez]], [[Juan Fernández Navarrete|Navarrete "El Mudo"]].

==Economy==
Logroño is the shopping and financial capital of [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]]. Its economy is heavily reliant on [[wine]], the most popular of which is [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja D.O.]] Logroño is twinned with [[Dunfermline]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Libourne]], [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], [[Rancagua]], [[Ciudad de La Rioja]], [[Brescia]], [[El Hagounia]]. The airport [[Logroño-Agoncillo Airport|Logroño-Agoncillo]] connects the city with Madrid.

==Food==
There are over 50 ''taperías'' (tapas restaurants) located within a four-block area near the town center. The traditional tapas restaurants often serve only one tapa [such as ''seta'' (mushroom), served as ''pincho'' – ''pintxo'' in [[Basque language|Basque]] – meaning one serving, or ''media ración'' ("half portion"), a small plate of tapas, but offer the [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja D.O.]]

==Climate==

The weather in Logroño – mostly due to its peculiar location, both in terms of distance to the [[Atlantic]] coast and in the situation along the course of the [[Ebro river]], is characterized by values ranging from those typically found in temperate [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] climates to the warmer and drier ones observed in southeastern [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] regions of the river's valley. However, the weather station has a [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk'') with [[humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] influences. The average annual temperature is {{convert|13.9|°C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weather in Logroño|url=http://www.logrono-hotels.com/information/weather.html|access-date=12 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501161603/http://www.logrono-hotels.com/information/weather.html|archive-date=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="AEMET.es: ‘Standard Climate Values for Logroño, ES’">{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=9170&k=rio|title=Standard Climate Values for Logroño|publisher=Agencia Estatal de Meteorología|access-date=5 June 2015}}</ref> Although infrequent, unusually low temperatures during the winter can drop to {{convert|-5|C|0}} or even lower, while daily high averages may exceptionally exceed the mark of {{convert|38|C|0}} in a particularly hot summer. The average annual precipitation is about {{convert|400|mm|2|abbr=on}}, regularly spread over the whole year: from {{convert|20|–|25|mm|2|abbr=on}} in drier periods to the {{convert|45|-|50|mm|2|abbr=on}} range in the rainiest.<ref name="AEMET.es: ‘Standard Climate Values for Logroño, ES’" />  The winds that affect the city are as follows: the northerly [[Cierzo]], the southerly Ábrego, the easterly Solano, and the westerly Castellano. Intermediate winds are the northeasterly Navarrico, the northwesterly Regañón, the southwesterly Burgalés and the southeasterly Soriano.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}
