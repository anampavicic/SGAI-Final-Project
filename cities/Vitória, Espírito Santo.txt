'''Vitória''' ({{IPA|pt|viˈtɔɾjɐ}}; {{Literal translation|Victory}}) is the capital of the [[Federative units of Brazil|state]] of [[Espírito Santo]], [[Brazil]]. It is located on [[Vitória (island)|a small island]] within a bay where a number of rivers meet the sea. It was founded in 1551. The city proper is {{convert|93|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} and has a population of 322,869 (2022), whilst the [[Greater Vitória]] metropolitan area has a population of more than 1,880,828, the 14th largest in Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |last=PRODEST |last2=ES |first2=Portal |title=Censo 2022: quase metade da população capixaba vive na Grande Vitória |url=https://www.es.gov.br/Noticia/censo-2022-quase-metade-da-populacao-capixaba-vive-na-grande-vitoria |access-date=2024-07-02 |website=Portal ES |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

Vitória is a riverine island surrounded by Vitória's Bay. In addition to Vitória, the main island, another 34 islands and a mainland portion are part of the municipality, totalling {{convert|93.381|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=off}}. Originally there were 50 islands, many of which were joined to the largest island by landfill.

In 1998, the [[United Nations]] rated Vitória as the fourth best state [[Capital (political)|capital]] in Brazil to live in, rating cities on health, education, and social improvement projects. Among the Brazilian capitals, Vitória currently maintains the second best [[human development index]] (HDI) (after [[Florianópolis]]) according to research from  the [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas|Getulio Vargas Foundation]]. It was considered the fourth best Brazilian city to live in by the [[United Nations]] in 2013, behind [[São Caetano do Sul]], [[Águas de São Pedro]] and [[Florianópolis]], and it was ranked as having the highest [[gross domestic product per capita|GDP per capita]].

The city has two major ports: the Port of Vitória and the [[Port of Tubarão]]. These ports are part of the largest port complex of the country, which are considered the best in quality of Brazil. The city, which lies on the coast, is close to the mountains of [[Espírito Santo]]. Through the city's port authority, the city council also manages the [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]] islands, {{convert|1,100|km|mi|abbr=off}} off the coast, which are important meteorological bases because of their strategic position: located in an area of dispersion of air masses.

== Geography ==
Vitória is a city located on the [[Southeastern Brazil|southeastern coast of Brazil]]. It belongs to the state of [[Espírito Santo]], with the role of the capital of the state. Its territory extends over 97.12&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, being one of the smallest cities in the state and the smallest among the 27 Brazilian capitals.

Located in Vitória Bay, it is divided between the mainland and the island of Vitória. The municipality has an outlet, to the east, to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and borders three other municipalities: [[Serra, Espírito Santo|Serra]], to the north, [[Cariacica]] to the west, and [[Vila Velha]] to the south. Together with them and the municipalities of Fundão, Guarapari and Viana, it forms the Metropolitan Region of Vitória, also called Greater Vitória.

The city of Vitória integrates the domain of the coastal plain. Its substrate is divided between an area of folds and another of sedimentary deposits, which gives it a very rugged relief composed of hills, some of them derived from residual forms, gently undulating terrains and plains. The city is part of the [[Atlantic Forest]], a biome that extends along the eastern [[coast]] of [[Brazil]], as well as part of the coastal-marine system. In this way, the plant cover of Espírito Santo is composed of [[tropical forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s, [[sandbank]]s and [[dune]] vegetation.

Two rivers are responsible for supplying the Metropolitan Region of Vitória: Santa Maria da Vitória river and Jucu river. The [[beach]]es that make up the coast of the city are the beaches of Camburi, Curva da Jurema and Castanheiras. The municipality of Vitória is composed of 80 [[neighborhood]]s, which are divided into nine different administrative regions:

*Centro
*Santo Antônio
*Jucutuquara
*Maruípe
*Praia do Canto
*Continental
*São Pedro
*Jardim Camburi
*Jardim da Penha

===Relief===
The relief of the islands is an extension of the continent, whether granite, surrounded by the sea and native Brazilian restinga-mangue vegetation. The central massif of the island of Vitória, Morro da Fonte Grande, has an altitude of 308.8 m and the main granitic outcrops are Pedra dos Dois Olhos, with 296m, and Morro de São Benedito, with 194m of altitude. Vitória's highest point is Pico do Desejado, located in the [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Trindade Island]], with 601m of altitude, eleven hundred kilometers away from the mainland coastline.

The city's climate is tropical, with average annual temperature of {{convert|23|C|F|0}} and the occurrence of rainfall specially in the months from October to January. Temperatures can vary greatly in winter and can reach {{convert|30|C|F|0}} in times of drought but {{convert|12|C|F|0}} when cold fronts occur followed by an abnormally cold temperature of the ocean.

The highest absolute maximum temperature ever recorded in the city is {{convert|39.6|C|F|1}} (INMET) on February 25, 2006, and the minimum is less than {{convert|9|C|F|0}}, which resulted from the cold [[Falkland Current|Falklands oceanic current]].

Vitória shares the position of the Brazilian capital with the lowest rates of rainfall with [[Rio de Janeiro]] at approximately {{convert|918|mm|in|1}} annually. Vitória is also the city that presents the lowest temperature range in practically the whole state of Espírito Santo, as a result both of its oceanic climate and the protection that the mountains afford from major weather changes influenced by air masses.

Vitória is one of the hottest cities in the state of Espírito Santo, due to [[Air pollution|atmospherical pollution]] and the [[Urban heat island|large cluster of buildings]], in addition to several mountains on the island, which block the south wind, which traditionally occurs on cold days in the state. This causes the minimum of the city being {{convert|2|C-change}} warmer than the average in the state.

Another contributing factor is that the level of rainfall in the city is lesser than Espírito Santo's average as a whole, by about {{convert|350|mm|in|1}}. This thermal variation can be easily noticed by comparing the temperatures of Vitória with the nearby town of Vila Velha, noted in all seasons, specially in winter, the minimum of Vila Velha is {{convert|1|C|F|0}}, {{convert|3|C-change}} lower than in Vitória.

== History ==
{{See also|History of Espírito Santo|Captaincy of Espírito Santo}}
[[File:Vitória-ES_1903.JPG|thumb|right|View of Vitória in 1903.]]
Vila Velha, which was the capital of the [[Captaincy of Espírito Santo]], found itself in constant attacks from the [[Tupi-Guarani]]-speaking and possibly some [[Macro-Jê]]-speaking indigenous peoples and the French and Dutch. The Portuguese then decided to move away the capital and chose an island near the mainland, called by some of the native peoples Guanaani Island. Vila Nova do Espírito Santo, as it was called, was founded on September 8, 1551, and later renamed Vitória in memory of the victory in a great battle led by the holder of the captaincy, [[Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, captain of Espírito Santo|Vasco Fernandes Coutinho]], against Goytacaz Amerindians.
[[File:Vitória (ES), 1937.tif|left|thumb|Vitória, 1937. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
Until the last century, the limits of the current capital of Espírito Santo were Fort São João, where is currently located the Club de Regatas Saldanha da Gama, near the city center, and the hill where sits the actual Santa Casa de Misericórdia hospital, in Vila Rubim. The city was built on the highlands, which originated several narrow streets. The lowlands were under attack and because of that a number of fortresses were built in the coastline.

On February 24, 1823, the town of Vitória became a city, but its insular isolation prevented its development. From 1894 on,  many landfills were implemented in the lower parts of the city with the coffee cycle, changing the shape of the island and urbanising it. Several new neighbourhoods were thus inhabited and public steps built to connect them with the higher ground and ancient houses were demolished. Moreover, sanitation was improved. In 1927, the bridge that connected the island to the mainland was opened and it was followed in 1941 by the first harbour pier.

The port had an important development. Wide avenues were opened over landfills. With these changes, the city became the largest urban space of State of Espírito Santo, a metropolis. In 1970, the Vitória Harbour rose to one of the most important in the country, and the city began its industrialization process. The modernization of the island led to the disappearance of almost all traces of the Colonial and Imperial Brazilian epochs.

== Transportation ==
[[File:Aeroporto_de_vitoria.jpg|thumb|right|Vitória International Airport.]]
[[File:Novo Aeroporto de VIX.png|thumb|right|Entrance of VIX Airport.]]

=== Airport ===
[[Eurico de Aguiar Salles Airport|Eurico de Aguiar Salles Airport (Goiabeiras)]] is located on a land plot of just over 5.2 million square meters. Since construction of its first step, finished in 1946, Vitória Airport has undergone several expansions and modernizations, but current demand has surpassed its capacity of 2.9 million passengers a year. The passenger terminal is air conditioned, with a constructed area of nearly 17,000 square meters, a check-in concourse, 25 check-in counters and boarding and arrival lounges. The recent construction of new aircraft parking boxes on the aprons has improved the airport's operational efficiency.

In 2012, more than 3.7 million passengers used the airport, and in 2013 this rose to almost 4 million. Vitória is one of the 32 airports in the Infraero network that has a cargo terminal. In May 1999, the first direct international freight connection started between Vitoria and the United States ([[Miami]]) began operating to Vitória, facilitating imports to the state of [[Espírito Santo]]. Today there are five such flights a week.

=== Public Transportation ===
Vitoria has two urban transportation systems. 
*The first one, which only works in the city, known by the locals as "verdinhos" because the colors of the bus, the municipal fleet is divided into three bus companies operating 52 conventional lines and 2 selective lines with air conditioning. The passages payment system is electronic ticketing and has service in all districts of the city.
*The Transcol system, linking the capital to other cities of Vitoria, and the lines run along major corridors such as Victoria Av and Beira Mar Av.

[[File:Terceira Ponte (10038703316).jpg|right|thumb|Bay and bridge.]]

=== Highways ===
The main access roads are the [[BR-101]], a motorway linking the Brazilian south and northeast with the Metropolitan Region of Greater Vitória, the BR-262 that connects the Central region with Vitória and the Rodovia do Sol (Sun Motorway). Aside from the national highways, the ES-060 runs through the city, which links the local coastal regions.

=== Ports ===
The city has two ports: the Port of Vitória and the [[Porto do Tubarão]].

The '''Porto de Vitória''' is the most difficult port for ships to access in all of Brazil. The Bay of Vitória is extremely narrow, with rocks and hills that complicate access by freighters and maritime cruisers to the docks. Ships, cars, and people all compete for space. There are restrictions on traffic, limiting the use of the port. Currently, the port is mostly used by cruise ships and for the repair of ships and oil platforms.

The '''[[Port of Tubarão]]''' was designed in the 1960s by [[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]] when the Port of Vitória began showing signs of saturation. It offers much easier access to the sea. Since its opening in 1966, its capacity has gradually increased, reaching 80 million tonnes/year in the last decade. Although originally created to export iron ore, in recent years, it has added silos for storing grains and soybean meal. The port is located at one end of Camburi Beach.

=== Railways ===
The [[Vitória-Minas Railway]], which carries cargo from the Central Region, also carries passengers from Vitória to Belo Horizonte.

===Bridge===
The [[Deputy Darcy Castelo de Mendonça]] Bridge, also known as the [[Third Bridge]] (Portuguese: Terceira Ponte), is the second tallest [[bridge]] in [[Brazil]], connecting and reducing the distance between the cities of [[Vila Velha]] and Vitória.
