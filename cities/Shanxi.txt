The capital and largest city of the province is [[Taiyuan]], while its next most populated prefecture-level cities are [[Changzhi]] and [[Datong]]. Its one-character abbreviation is {{linktext|lang=zh-hans|晋}} ({{zh|p=Jìn|links=no}}), after the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] that existed there during the [[Spring and Autumn period]].

The name ''Shanxi'' means 'West of the mountains', a reference to the province's location west of the [[Taihang Mountains]].{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=234}} Shanxi borders [[Hebei]] to the east, [[Henan]] to the south, [[Shaanxi]] to the west and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the north. Shanxi's terrain is characterised by a plateau bounded partly by mountain ranges. Shanxi's culture is largely dominated by the ethnic [[Han Chinese|Han]] majority, who make up over 99% of its population. [[Jin Chinese]] is considered by some linguists to be a distinct language from Mandarin and its geographical range covers most of Shanxi. Both Jin and Mandarin are spoken in Shanxi.

Shanxi is a leading producer of [[coal in China]], possessing roughly a third of China's total coal deposits. Nevertheless, Shanxi's GDP per capita remains below the national average. The province hosts the [[Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center]].

The province is also known for having by far the largest number of historic buildings among all Chinese provinces, by possessing over 70% of China's surviving buildings built during or predating the [[Song dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:地上文物看山西，太原纯阳宫"变身"山西古建筑博物馆|date=13 April 2020|url=https://news.sina.com.cn/o/2020-04-13/doc-iirczymi6100265.shtml |language=zh}}</ref> Also notable are the [[Yungang Grottoes]] in [[Datong]], Shanxi, which date back over 1500 years.

==History==
===Pre-Imperial China===
In the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–403 BC), the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] was located in what is now Shanxi Province. It underwent a three-way split into the states of [[state of Han|Han]], [[state of Zhao|Zhao]], and [[state of Wei|Wei]] in 403 BC, the traditional date taken as the start of the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC). By 221 BC, all of these states had fallen to the [[state of Qin]], which established the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC).<ref>《晉國史綱要》第163頁 (Jin State Compendium, page 163)</ref>

===Imperial China===
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2013}}

The [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 220) ruled Shanxi as the [[zhou (political division)|province]] of [[Bing (province)|Bingzhou]].

During the invasion of northern nomads in the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period (304–439), several regimes including the [[Later Zhao]], [[Former Yan]], [[Former Qin]], and [[Later Yan]] continuously controlled Shanxi. They were followed by [[Northern Wei dynasty|Northern Wei]] (386–534), a [[Xianbei]] kingdom, which had one of its earlier capitals at present-day [[Datong]] in northern Shanxi, and which went on to rule nearly all of northern China.

The [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) originated in Taiyuan. During the Tang dynasty and after, present day Shanxi was called ''[[Hedong Commandery|Hédōng]]'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=河東}}), or "east of the (Yellow) river". [[Empress Wu Zetian]], one of China's only female rulers, was born in Shanxi in 624.

During the first part of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907–960), Shanxi supplied rulers of three of the Five Dynasties. Among the Ten Kingdoms, it was the only one located in northern China. Shanxi was initially home to the ''[[jiedushi]]'' (commander) of Hedong, [[Li Cunxu]], who overthrew the first of the Five Dynasties, [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] (907–923) to establish the second, [[Later Tang]] (923–936). Another ''jiedushi'' of Hedong, [[Gaozu of Later Jin|Shi Jingtang]], overthrew Later Tang to establish the third of the Five Dynasties, [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], and yet another ''jiedushi'' of Hedong, [[Liu Zhiyuan]], established the fourth of the Five Dynasties ([[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]]) after the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] destroyed Later Jin, the third. Finally, when the fifth of the Five Dynasties ([[Later Zhou]]) emerged, the ''jiedushi'' of Hedong at the time, [[Liu Chong]], rebelled and established an independent state called [[Northern Han]], one of the Ten Kingdoms, in what is now northern and central Shanxi.

[[Shi Jingtang]], founder of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], the third of the Five Dynasties, ceded a piece of northern China to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]s in return for military assistance. This territory, called the [[Sixteen Prefectures|Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun]], included a part of northern Shanxi. The ceded territory became a major problem for the Song dynasty's defense against the Khitans for the next 100 years because it lay south of the [[Great Wall]].

The [[later Zhou]], the last dynasty of the Five Dynasties period was founded by [[Guo Wei]], a Han Chinese, who served as the Assistant Military Commissioner at the court of the Later Han which was ruled by [[Shatuo Turks]]. He founded his dynasty by launching a military coup against the Turkic [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]] Emperor however, his newly established dynasty was short-lived and was conquered by the [[Song dynasty]] in 960.

[[File:The_Fugong_Temple_Wooden_Pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Pagoda of Fogong Temple built in 1056]]
In the early years of the [[Northern Song dynasty]] (960–1127), the sixteen ceded prefectures continued to be an area of contention between the [[Song dynasty]] and the [[Liao dynasty]]. Later the [[Southern Song dynasty]] abandoned all of [[North China]], including Shanxi, to the [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] in 1127 after the [[Jingkang Incident]] of the [[Jin campaigns against the Song dynasty|Jin-Song wars]].

The [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] administered China into provinces but did not establish Shanxi as a province. Shanxi only gained its present name and approximate borders during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) which were of the same land area and borders as the previous Hedong Commandery of the Tang dynasty.

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), Shanxi extended north beyond the Great Wall to include parts of [[Inner Mongolia]], including what is now the city of [[Hohhot]], and overlapped with the jurisdiction of the [[Eight Banners]] and the [[Guihua Tümed]] [[banner (Inner Mongolia)|banner]] in that area.

For centuries, Shanxi served as a center for trade and banking. The "[[Shanxi merchants]]" were once synonymous with wealth.<ref>Shanxi Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, ed., ''Shanxi piaohao shiliao'' (山西票号史料) (Taiyuan: Shanxi jingji chubanshe, 1992), pp. 36–39.</ref> The well-preserved city and UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] [[Pingyao]] shows many signs of its economic importance during the Qing dynasty.

===Early Republic of China (1912–1937)===
[[File:Yan_Xishan.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Yan Xishan]], [[warlord]] of Shanxi during the Republic of China.]]
With the [[1911 Revolution|collapse of the Qing dynasty]], Shanxi became part of the newly established [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. From 1911 to 1949, during the period of the Republic of China's period of rule over [[Mainland China]], Shanxi was mostly dominated by the warlord [[Yan Xishan]] until the [[Chinese Communist Party]] took full control in 1949;<ref>Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies''</ref> Communists had already set up secret bases in 1936, but did not completely overturn Yan and the [[Nationalist government]] until 1949.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 220-221</ref> Early in Yan's rule he decided that, unless he was able to modernize and revive the economy of his small, poor, remote province, he would be unable to protect Shanxi from rival warlords. Yan devoted himself to modernizing Shanxi and developing its resources during his reign over the province. He has been viewed by Western biographers as a transitional figure who advocated using Western technology to protect Chinese traditions, while at the same time reforming older political, social and economic conditions in a way that paved the way for the radical changes that would occur after his rule.<ref name="Portrait1">Gillin, Donald G. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2943488 "Portrait of a Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province, 1911–1930."] ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 19, No. 3, May, 1960. Retrieved February 23, 2011. p.289</ref>

In 1918 there was an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in northern Shanxi that lasted for two months and killed 2,664 people. Yan's interactions with the Western medical personnel he met with to discuss how to suppress the epidemic inspired him to modernize and improve Shanxi's medical infrastructure which he began by funding the Research Society for the Advancement of Chinese Medicine, based in Taiyuan, in 1921.  Highly unusual in China at the time, the school had a four-year curriculum and included courses in both Chinese and Western Medicine. The main skills that Yan hoped physicians trained at the school would learn were: a standardized system of diagnosis; sanitary science, including [[bacteriology]]; surgical skills, including [[obstetrics]]; and, the use of diagnostic instruments. Yan hoped that his support of the school would eventually lead to increased revenues in the domestic and international trade of Chinese drugs, improved [[public health]], and improved [[Public Education|public education]]. Yan's promotion of a modern curriculum and infrastructure of Chinese medicine achieved limited success, but much of the teaching and publication that this school of medicine produced was limited to the area around Taiyuan: by 1949 three of the seven government-run hospitals were in the city. In 1934 the province produced a ten-year-plan that envisaged employing a hygiene worker in every village, but the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion in 1937]] and the subsequent [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] made it impossible to carry these plans out. Yan's generous support for the Research Association for the Improvement of Chinese Medicine generated a body of teaching and publication in modern Chinese medicine that became one of the foundations of the national institution of modern traditional Chinese medicine that was adopted in the 1950s.<ref>Harrison, Henrietta. "The Experience of Illness in Early Twentieth-Century Shanxi.". East Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine. No.42. pp.39–72. 2015. pp.61–63.</ref>

Yan invested in Shanxi's industrial infrastructure, and by 1949 the area around Taiyuan was a major national producer of coal, iron, chemicals, and munitions.<ref>Goodman, David S. G. [https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/6052/3/2004003081.pdf "Structuring Local Identity: Nation, Province and County in Shanxi During the 1990s"]. ''The China Quarterly''. Vol.172, December 2002. pp.837–862. Retrieved April 17, 2019. p.840</ref> Yan was able to protect the province from his rivals for the period of his rule partially due to his building of an arsenal in Taiyuan that, for the entire period of his administration, remained the only center in China capable of producing field artillery. Yan's army was successful in eradicating banditry in Shanxi, allowing him to maintain a relatively high level of public order and security.<ref name="Portrait2">Gillin, Donald G. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2943488 "Portrait of a Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province, 1911–1930."] ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 19, No. 3, May, 1960.

Yan went to great lengths to eradicate social traditions which he considered antiquated. He insisted that all men in Shanxi abandon their Qing-era queues, giving police instructions to clip off the queues of anyone still wearing them. In one instance, Yan lured people into theatres in order to have his police systematically cut the hair of the audience.<ref name="Portrait2"/> He attempted to combat widespread female illiteracy by creating in each district at least one vocational school in which peasant girls could be given a primary-school education and taught domestic skills. After [[National Revolutionary Army]] military victories in the 1925 generated great interest in Shanxi for the [[Kuomintang]]'s ideology, including [[Women's rights in China|women's rights]], Yan allowed girls to enroll in middle school and college, where they promptly formed a women's association.<ref>Gillin, Donald G. ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p.24"</ref>

Yan attempted to eradicate the custom of [[foot binding]], threatening to sentence men who married women with bound feet, and mothers who bound their daughters' feet, to hard labor in state-run factories. He discouraged the use of the traditional [[lunar calendar]] and encouraged the development of local [[Boy Scouts|boy scout organizations]]. Like the Communists who later succeeded Yan, he punished habitual lawbreakers to "redemption through labour" in state-run factories.<ref name="Portrait2"/>

After the failed attempt by the [[Chinese Red Army]] to establish bases in southern Shanxi in early 1936 Yan became convinced that the Communists were lesser threats to his rule than either the Nationalists or the Japanese. He then negotiated a secret anti-Japanese "[[Second United Front|United Front]]" with the Communists in October 1936 and invited them to establish operations in Shanxi. Yan, under the slogan "resistance against the enemy and defense of the soil", attempted to recruit young, patriotic intellectuals to his government in order to organize a local resistance to the threat of Japanese invasion. By the end of 1936 Taiyuan had become a gathering point for anti-Japanese intellectuals from all over China.<ref>Feng Chongyi and Goodman, David S. G., eds.

===War with Japan and the Chinese Civil War (1937–1949)===
The [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in July 1937 led the [[Imperial Japanese Armed Forces]] to invade China, and Shanxi was one of the first areas the Japanese attacked. When it became clear to Yan that his forces might not be successful in repelling the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], he invited Communist military forces to re-enter Shanxi. [[Zhu De]] became the commander of the [[Eighth Route Army]] active in Shanxi and was named the vice-commander of the Second War Zone, under Yan himself. Yan initially responded warmly to the re-entry of the arrival of Communist forces, and they were greeted with enthusiasm by Yan's officials and officers. Communist forces arrived in Shanxi just in time to help defeat a decisively more powerful Japanese force attempting to move through the strategic [[Pingxing Pass]]. The [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] was the largest battle won by the Communists against the Japanese.<ref name="Warlord263-4">Gillin, Donald G. ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. pp.&nbsp;263–264</ref>

After the Japanese responded to this defeat by outflanking the defenders and moving towards [[Taiyuan]], the Communists avoided decisive battles and mostly attempted to harass Japanese forces and sabotage Japanese lines of supply and communication. The Japanese suffered, but mostly ignored the Eighth Route Army and continued to advance towards Yan's capital. The lack of attention directed at their forces gave the Communists time to recruit and propagandize among the local peasant populations (who generally welcomed Communist forces enthusiastically) and to organize a network of militia units, local guerrilla bands and popular mass organizations.<ref name="Warlord263-4"/>

Genuine Communist efforts to resist the Japanese gave them the authority to carry out sweeping and radical social and economic reforms, mostly related to land and wealth redistribution, which they defended by labeling those who resisted as ''[[Hanjian]]''. Communist efforts to resist the Japanese also won over Shanxi's small population of patriotic intellectuals, and conservative fears of resisting them effectively gave the Communists unlimited access to the rural population. Subsequent atrocities committed by the Japanese in the effort to rid Shanxi of Communist guerrillas aroused the hatred of millions in the Shanxi countryside, causing the rural population to turn to the Communists for leadership against the Japanese. All of these factors explain how, within a year of re-entering Shanxi, the Communists were able to take control of most of Shanxi not firmly held by the Japanese.<ref>Gillin, Donald G. ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p.271</ref>

[[File:Chinese troops marching in Xinkou.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Chinese troops marching to defend the mountain pass at Xinkou.]]
During the [[Battle of Xinkou]], the Chinese defenders resisted the efforts of Japan's elite [[Seishirō Itagaki|Itakagi Division]] for over a month, despite Japanese advantages in artillery and air support. By the end of October 1937, Japan's losses were four times greater than those suffered at Pingxingguan, and the Itakagi Division was close to defeat. Contemporary Communist accounts called the battle "the most fierce in North China", while Japanese accounts called the battle a "stalemate". In an effort to save their forces at Xinkou, Japanese forces began an effort to occupy Shanxi from a second direction, in the east. After a week of fighting, Japanese forces captured the strategic [[Niangzi Pass]], opening the way to capturing Taiyuan. Communist guerrilla tactics were ineffective in slowing down the Japanese advance. The defenders at Xinkou, realizing that they were in danger of being outflanked, withdrew southward, past Taiyuan, leaving a small force of 6,000 men to hold off the entire Japanese army. A representative of the Japanese Army, speaking of [[Battle of Taiyuan|the final defense of Taiyuan]], said that "nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately".<ref>Gillin, Donald G. ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 272-273</ref>

The Japanese suffered 30,000 dead and an equal number wounded in their effort to take northern Shanxi. A Japanese study found that the battles of Pingxingguan, Xinkou, and Taiyuan were responsible for over half of all the casualties suffered by the Japanese army in North China. Yan himself was forced to withdraw after having 90% of his army destroyed, including a large force of reinforcements sent into Shanxi by the central government. Throughout 1937, numerous high-ranking Communist leaders, including [[Mao Zedong]], lavished praise on Yan for waging an uncompromising campaign of resistance against the Japanese. Possibly because of the severity of his losses in northern Shanxi, Yan abandoned a plan of defense based on positional warfare, and began to reform his army as a force capable of waging guerrilla warfare. After 1938 most of Yan's followers came to refer to his regime as a "guerrilla administration".<ref>Gillin, Donald G. ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. pp.273–275, 279</ref>

After the [[surrender of Japan]] and the end of the [[Second World War]], [[Yan Xishan]] was notable for his ability to recruit thousands of Japanese soldiers stationed in northwest Shanxi in 1945, including their commanding officers, into his army. By recruiting the Japanese into his service in the manner that he did, he retained both the extensive industrial complex around Taiyuan and virtually all of the managerial and technical personnel employed by the Japanese to run it. Yan was so successful in convincing surrendered Japanese to work for him that, as word spread to other areas of north China, Japanese soldiers from those areas began to converge on Taiyuan to serve his government and army. At its greatest strength the Japanese "special forces" under Yan totaled 15,000 troops, plus an officer corps that was distributed throughout Yan's army. These numbers were reduced to 10,000 after serious American efforts to repatriate the Japanese were partially successful. Yan's Japanese army was instrumental in helping him to retain control of most of northern Shanxi during much of the subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]], but by 1949 casualties had reduced the number of Japanese soldiers under Yan's command to 3,000. The leader of the Japanese under Yan's command, Hosaku Imamura, committed suicide on the day that Taiyuan fell to Communist forces.<ref>Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles.

Yan Xishan himself (along with most of the provincial treasury) was airlifted out of Taiyuan in March 1949. Shortly afterwards [[Republic of China Air Force]] planes stopped dropping food and supplies for the defenders due to fears of being shot down by the advancing Communists.<ref>Gillin, Donald G. ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p.288.</ref> The [[People's Liberation Army]], depending largely on their reinforcements of artillery, launched a major assault on April 20, 1949, and succeeded in taking all positions surrounding Taiyuan by April 22. A subsequent appeal to the defenders to surrender was refused. On the morning of April 22, 1949, the PLA bombarded Taiyuan with 1,300 pieces of artillery and breached the city's walls, initiating bloody street-to-street fighting for control of the city. At 10:00 am, April 22, the [[Taiyuan Campaign]] ended with the Communists in complete control of Shanxi. Total Nationalist casualties amounted to all 145,000 defenders, many of whom were taken as POWs. The Communists lost 45,000 men and an unknown number of civilian laborers they had drafted, all of whom were either killed or injured.<ref name="Spence488">[[jonathan Spence|Spence, Jonathan D.]] ''[[The Search for Modern China]]'', [[W.W. Norton and Company]]. 1999. p.488</ref>

The fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the Chinese Civil War in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated [[Southern Ming|Ming loyalists]] who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus. Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. The dead included Yan's nephew-in-law, who was serving as governor, and his cousin, who ran his household. [[Liang Huazhi]], the head of Yan's "Patriotic Sacrifice League", had fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan. For six months Liang put up a fierce resistance, leading both Yan's remaining [[Republic of China Army]] forces and his thousands of Japanese mercenaries. When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners. In a final act of desperation, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.<ref name="Spence488"/>

===People's Republic of China (1949–present)===
Soon after the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]], [[Mao Zedong]] assigned [[Kang Sheng]] to carry out [[Land Reform Movement (China)|land reform]] in Shanxi. Kang encouraged the populace to have numerous farmers from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds denounced as "landlords," beaten, arrested, and executed. In some areas of the province as many as one in five residents were denounced as landlords, and his program was copied throughout the rest of the new [[China|People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dikötter |first=Frank |title=The Tragedy of Liberation: A History of the Chinese Revolution, 1945-1957 |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-62040-347-1 |edition=1 |location=London |pages=72–74 |language=en}}</ref> Shanxi became the site of Mao's "model brigade" of [[Dazhai, Xiyang County|Dazhai]]: a utopian communist scheme in [[Xiyang County]] that was supposed to be the model for all other peasants in China to emulate. If the people of Dazhai were especially suited for such an experiment, it is possible that decades of Yan's socialist indoctrination may have prepared the people of Shanxi for Communist rule. After the death of Mao, the experiment was discontinued, and most peasants reverted to private farming under [[Chinese economic reform|post-Maoist economic reforms]].<ref>Bonavia, David. ''China's Warlords''. New York: Oxford University Press. 1995. p.138.</ref>

== Geography ==
Shanxi is located on a plateau made up of higher ground to the east ([[Taihang Mountains]]) and the west ([[Lüliang Mountains]]) and a series of valleys in the center through which the [[Fen River]] runs. The highest peak is [[Mount Wutai]] (Wutai Shan) in northeastern Shanxi with an altitude of 3,058 m. The [[Great Wall of China]] forms most of the northern border with [[Inner Mongolia]]. The [[Zhongtiao Mountains]] run along part of the southern border and separate Shanxi from the east–west part of the Yellow River. [[Mount Hua]] is to the southwest.

The [[Yellow River]] forms the western border of Shanxi with [[Shaanxi]]. The [[Fen River|Fen]] and Qin rivers, tributaries of the Yellow River, run north-to-south through the province, and [[drainage basin|drain]] much of its area. The north of the province is drained by tributaries of the [[Hai River]], such as [[Sanggan River|Sanggan]] and [[Hutuo River|Hutuo]] rivers. The largest natural lake in Shanxi is [[Xiechi Lake]], a salt lake near [[Yuncheng, Shanxi|Yuncheng]] in southwestern Shanxi.

Shanxi has a [[Continental climate|continental]] [[monsoon]] climate, and is rather arid. Average January temperatures are below 0&nbsp;°C, while average July temperatures are around 21–26&nbsp;°C. Winters are long, dry, and cold, while summer is warm and humid. Spring is extremely dry and prone to dust storms. Shanxi is one of the sunniest parts of China; early summer heat waves are common. Annual precipitation averages around {{convert|350|to|700|mm}}, with 60% of it concentrated between June and August.<ref name=":0" />

Major cities:
* [[Taiyuan]]
* [[Datong]]
* [[Changzhi]]
* [[Yangquan]]
* [[Jinzhong]]
* [[Linfen]]
* [[Jincheng]]
* [[Yuncheng]]

The outline of Shanxi's territory is a parallelogram that runs from southwest to northeast. It is a typical mountain plateau widely covered by [[loess]]. The terrain is high in the northeast and low in the southwest. The interior of the plateau is undulating, the valleys are vertical and horizontal, and the types of landforms are complex and diverse. There are mountains, hills, terraces, plains, and rivers. The area of mountains and hills accounts for 80.1% of the total area of the province, and the area of Pingchuan and river valleys accounts for 19.9% of the total area. Most of the province's altitude is above 1,500 meters, and the highest point is the Yedoufeng, the main peak of [[Mount Wutai|Wutai Mountain]], with an altitude of 3061.1 meters, which is the highest peak in northern China.<ref name=":0" />

=== Climate ===

Shanxi is located in the inland of the mid-latitude zone and belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate in terms of climate type. Due to the influence of solar radiation, monsoon circulation and geographical factors, Shanxi's climate has four distinct seasons, synchronous rain and heat, sufficient sunshine, significant climate difference between north and south, wide temperature difference between winter and summer, and large temperature difference between day and night. The annual average temperature in Shanxi Province is between 4.2 and 14.2&nbsp;°C. The overall distribution trend is from north to south and from basin to high mountain. The annual precipitation in the whole province is between 358 and 621&nbsp;mm, and the seasonal distribution is uneven. In June–August, the precipitation is relatively concentrated, accounting for about 60% of the annual precipitation, and the precipitation distribution in the province is greatly affected by the terrain.<ref name=":0" />

=== Area ===

The province has a length of {{convert|682|km|abbr=on}} and a width of {{convert|385|km|abbr=on}} from east to west, with a total area of {{convert|156700|km2|abbr=on}}, accounting for 1.6% of the country's total area.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://www.shanxi.gov.cn/sq/sqgk/201607/t20160713_349849.shtml |script-title=zh:省情概貌 |publisher=Shanxi People's Government |date=2016-07-13}}</ref>

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Shanxi}}

The [[Governor of Shanxi]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Shanxi. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the provincial Communist [[Party Committee Secretary]] ({{lang|zh-CN|中共山西省委书记}}), colloquially termed the "Shanxi [[Party Committee Secretary]]". As is the case in almost all Chinese provinces, the provincial party secretary and Governor are not natives of Shanxi; rather, they are outsiders who are, in practice, appointed by the central party and government authorities.

The province went through significant political instability since 2004, due largely to the number of scandals that have hit the province on labour safety, the environment, and the interconnected nature between the provincial political establishment and big coal companies. [[Yu Youjun]] was sent by the central government in 2005 to become Governor but resigned in the wake of the [[2007 Chinese slave scandal|Shanxi slave labour scandal]] in 2007. He was succeeded by [[Meng Xuenong]], who had been previously sacked as Mayor of Beijing in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak. Meng himself was removed from office in 2008 after only a few months on the job due to the political fallout from the [[2008 Shanxi mudslide]]. In 2008, provincial Political Consultative Conference Chair, one of the highest-ranked provincial officials, [[Jin Yinhuan]], died in a car accident.

Since [[Xi Jinping]]'s ascendancy to [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]] at the [[18th Party Congress (China)|18th Party Congress]], numerous highly ranked officials in Shanxi have been placed under investigation for corruption-related offenses, including four incumbent members [[Bai Yun (politician)|Bai Yun]], [[Chen Chuanping]], [[Du Shanxue]],  and [[Nie Chunyu]] of the provincial Communist Party Standing Committee. They were all removed from office around August 2014. The following were also removed from office:
* [[Ling Zhengce]], the provincial Political Consultative Conference vice-chair and the older brother of [[Ling Jihua]];
* [[Ling Jihua]], the province's Vice Governor [[Ren Runhou]];
* [[Shen Weichen]], former Taiyuan party secretary;
* [[Liu Suiji]], Taiyuan police secretary;
* [[Jin Daoming]], vice-chair of the provincial People's Congress;

==Economy==
The GDP per capita of Shanxi is below the national average. Compared to the provinces in east China, Shanxi is less developed for many reasons. Its geographic location limits its participation in international trade, which involves mostly eastern coastal provinces. Important crops in Shanxi include [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[millet]], [[legume]]s, and [[potato]]es. The local climate and dwindling water resources limit agriculture in Shanxi.<ref>[http://www.shanxigov.cn/gb/zgsx/sq/jjgk/ny/index.html Infos on Shanxi official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220221025/http://www.shanxigov.cn/gb/zgsx/sq/jjgk/ny/index.html |date=February 20, 2006 }}</ref>

As part of an effort to promote diversification in non-resource industries, since 2004, some local governments in Shanxi province have required that coal [[Mining industry of China|mining companies]] set aside funds for investing in non-coal business like [[Agriculture in China|agriculture]] and produce processing.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=54}} In 2006, the provincial government established a policy of "subsidizing peasants by coal" which made this diversification a provincewide requirement and encouraged local governments to develop policies like subsidies and favorable [[Taxation in China|tax]] treatment to further encourage mining companies to invest in non-coal business.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|pages=186-187}}

There are countless military-related industries in Shanxi due to its geographic location and history as the former base of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. [[Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center|Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre]], one of China's three satellite launch centers, is located in the middle of Shanxi with China's largest stockpile of [[nuclear missiles]].

Many private corporations, in joint ventures with the state-owned mining corporations, have invested billions of dollars in the mining industry of Shanxi . Hong Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-shing]] made one of his largest investments ever in China in exploiting [[coal gas]] in Shanxi. Foreign investors include mining companies from Canada, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The mining-related companies include Daqin Railway Co. Ltd., which runs one of the busiest and most technologically advanced railways in China, connecting [[Datong]] and [[Qinhuangdao]] exclusively for coal shipping.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The revenue of Daqin Railway Co. Ltd. is among the highest among Shanxi companies due to its export of coal to Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Shanxi's nominal GDP in 2011 was 1110.0 billion yuan (US$176.2 billion), ranked 21st in China.

=== Language ===
The dialects spoken in Shanxi have traditionally been included in the Northern or [[Mandarin dialects|Mandarin]] group. Since 1985, some linguists have argued that the dialects spoken in most of the province should be treated as a top-level division called [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], based on its preservation of the Middle Chinese [[entering tone]] (stop-final) category, unlike other dialects in northern China. These dialects are also noted for extremely complex [[tone sandhi]] systems. The dialects spoken in some areas in southwestern Shanxi near the borders with Henan and Shaanxi are classified in the [[Zhongyuan Mandarin]] subdivision of the Mandarin group.

=== Cuisine ===
[[Shanxi cuisine]] is most well known for its extensive use of [[vinegar]] as a condiment, as well as for a huge variety of [[noodle]] dishes, particularly [[knife-cut noodles]] or ''daoxiao mian'' ({{lang|zh-hans|刀削面}}), which are served with a range of sauces. A dish originating from [[Taiyuan]], the provincial capital, is [[Taiyuan Tounao]] ({{zh|links=no |s=太原头脑 |l=Taiyuan Head}}). It is a [[breakfast]] dish; a porridge-like stew made with mutton, [[Chinese yam]] ({{lang|zh|山药}}), lotus roots, ''[[Astragalus (plant)|astragalus]] membranaceus'' ({{zh|labels=no |s=黄芪 |l=membranous milk vetch}}), tuber onions, and yellow cooking [[huangjiu|wine]] for additional aroma. It can be enjoyed by dipping pieces of unleavened flatbread into the soup, and is reputed to have medicinal properties. [[Pingyao]] is famous for its unique [[corned beef|salt beef]], while the areas around [[Wutai Shan]] are known for wild [[mushrooms]]. The most popular local spirit is [[fenjiu]], a "light fragrance" variety of [[baijiu]] that is generally sweeter than other northern Chinese spirits.

=== Music ===
[[Shanxi Opera]] ({{lang|zh-hans|晋剧}} ''Jinju'') is the local form of [[Chinese opera]]. It was popularized during the late Qing dynasty, with the help of the then-ubiquitous Shanxi merchants who were active across parts of China. Also called ''Zhonglu Bangzi'' ({{lang|zh|中路梆子}}), it is a type of ''bangzi'' opera ({{lang|zh|梆子}}), a group of operas generally distinguished by their use of wooden clappers for rhythm and by a more energetic singing style; Shanxi opera is also complemented by ''quzi'' ({{lang|zh|曲子}}), a blanket term for more melodic styles from further south. [[Puzhou Opera]] ({{lang|zh-hans|蒲剧}} ''Puju''), from southern Shanxi, is a more ancient type of ''bangzi'' that makes use of very wide linear [[interval (music)|interval]]s.

=== Ancient commerce ===
[[Shanxi merchants]] ({{lang|zh-hant|晉商}} ''Jinshang'') constituted a historical phenomenon that lasted for centuries from the Song to the Qing dynasty. Shanxi merchants ranged far and wide from Central Asia to the coast of eastern China; by the Qing dynasty they were conducting trade across both sides of the Great Wall. During the late Qing dynasty, a new development occurred: the creation of ''piaohao'' ({{lang|zh-hant|票號}}), which were essentially [[bank]]s that provided services like money transfers and transactions, deposits, and loans. After the establishment of the first ''piaohao'' in [[Pingyao]], the bankers in Shanxi dominated China's financial market for centuries until the [[Xinhai Revolt|collapse of Qing dynasty]] and the coming of British banks.
