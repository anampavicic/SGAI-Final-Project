The city was governed by different ethnic groups over the course of its history. Mashhad was previously a small village, which by the 9th century had been known as Sanabad, and which was located—along with [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] and other villages—on the ancient [[Silk Road]] connecting them with [[Merv]] to the east. Mashhad would eventually outgrow all its surrounding villages. It gained its current name meaning "place of [[martyrdom]]" in reference to the [[Imam Reza shrine]], where the eighth [[Shia Islam|Shia Imam]], [[Ali al-Rida]], is buried. The Abbasid caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] is also buried within the same shrine. The shrine is an important place of [[pilgrimage]], visited by 25 millions each year in what is often described as "the holiest city in Iran".<ref name="Simigh"/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Higgins |first=Andrew |title=Inside Iran's Holy Money Machine - WSJ |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118072271215621679 |access-date=2024-05-17 |work=WSJ |language=en-US}}</ref>

Mashhad later also became associated with [[Ferdowsi]], the Persian poet and author of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', who was born in Tus (with many institutions in Mashhad named after him). Mashhad enjoyed relative prosperity in the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol period]], and continued to grow. Between 1736 and 1796, Mashhad became the capital of [[Afsharid Iran]] which was ruled by the [[Afsharid dynasty]] founded by [[Nader Shah]], [[Tomb of Nader Shah|whose tomb]] is located in the city. In the modern era, Mashhad continued to expand and became the hometown of some of the most significant literary figures and artists of modern Iran, such as the poet [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]], and the traditional Iranian singer and composer [[Mohammad-Reza Shajarian]]. On 30 October 2009 (the anniversary of Imam Reza's martyrdom), Iran's then-President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] declared Mashhad to be "Iran's spiritual capital".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.khorasannews.com/News.aspx?type=1&year=1388&month=8&day=9&id=281168 |script-title=fa: مشهد، پایتخت معنوی ایران اعلام شد | trans-title = Mashhad, Iran's spiritual capital | publisher = Khorasan newspaper | language = fa | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707030446/http://www.khorasannews.com/News.aspx?type=1&year=1388&month=8&day=9&id=281168 | archive-date = 7 July 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |script-title=fa:نام‌گذاري مشهد به عنوان پايتخت معنوي "Nombramiento de Mashhad como capital espiritual de Irán"|url=http://shahr.ir/fa/news/3841/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%E2%80%8C%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%88%D9%8A|publisher=Shahr.ir|date=1 November 2009|access-date=26 October 2013|language=fa|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131026085822/http://shahr.ir/fa/news/3841/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%E2%80%8C%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%88%D9%8A|archive-date=26 October 2013}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Mashhad|Greater Khorasan}}

===Etymology and early history===
Ancient Greek sources mention the passage and residence of [[Alexander the Great]] in this land, which was called "[[Susia]]" ({{langx|grc|Σούσια}}), in 330 BC.<ref>Diodorus (17.77.5)</ref><ref>Curtius (6.6.4-5)</ref><ref>Justin (12.3.8 )</ref><ref>Arrian (4.9.9)</ref> The map of [[Tabula Peutingeriana]], which dates back to the early [[Roman era]], names this city on the west of [[Merv]], Alexandria, instead of Susia.<ref>[https://www.tabula-peutingeriana.de/tabula.html?segm=b Tabvla Pevtingeriana, Segmentvm XII - M. Weber]</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]], says there is a city in the middle of [[Parthia]], near [[Asaak|Arsace]] and [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisiaea]], called "Alexandropolis" after its founder.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D29 Pliny, Nat. 6.29]</ref> Many Muslim historians, from the 10th to the 16th century AD, attribute the founding of "Sanabad" (the old name of the city) to Alexander.<ref>[http://lib.eshia.ir/71860/48/321 muhammad-bagher al-majlisi, bahaar-ol-anvaar]</ref><ref>[http://lib.eshia.ir/71660/2/299 feiz al-kashaani, al-vaafi]</ref> 

Also in the [[Shia]] [[hadith]] sources, which the narrators connect to the 7th to 9th centuries AD, there are quotations that [[Imam Ridha]] and [[Harun al-Rashid]] are buried in a city founded by "the righteous servant, the two-horned one", which is an Islamic title commonly attributed to Alexander the Great.<ref>[https://www.noorlib.ir/View/Fa/Book/BookView/Text/10958/2/527 al-kaafi]</ref><ref>[https://www.noorlib.ir/View/Fa/Book/BookView/Text/11355/2/62 al-ghoybah]</ref><ref>[https://www.noorlib.ir/View/Fa/Book/BookView/Text/11296/1/18 jaami-ol-akhbaar]</ref><ref>[https://www.noorlib.ir/View/Fa/Book/BookView/Text/2336/1/296 al-vaafi]</ref>

The older name of Mashhad is Sanabad ({{lang|fa|سناباد}} {{transl|fa|Sanâbâd}}). It was eventually renamed to Mashhad during the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]]. The name Mashhad comes from [[Arabic]], meaning a [[Mazar (mausoleum)]].<ref>E.J. Brill's ''First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936'' p. 127</ref><ref>''The Shias: A Short History'', Heinz Halm, p. 26</ref> It is also known as the place where [[Ali ar-Ridha]] ([[Persian language|Persian]], Imam Reza), the [[eighth Imam]] of Shia Muslims, died (according to the Shias, was martyred). Reza's shrine was placed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://persiatours.com/tips.htm|title=Iran travel Information|website=persiatours.com}}</ref>

The ancient [[Parthia]]n city of [[Patigrabana|Patigrabanâ]], mentioned in the [[Behistun inscription]] (520 BC) of the [[Achaemenid]] Emperor [[Darius the Great]], may have been located at the Mashhad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/articles/person/hystaspes-2/|title=Hystaspes (2) – Livius|website=livius.org|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 9th [[century]] (3rd century AH), Mashhad was a small city called Sanabad, which was situated {{convert|24|km|abbr=off}} away from [[Tus, Iran|Tus]]. There was a summer palace of [[Humayd ibn Qahtaba]], the governor of [[Khurasan]]. In 808, when [[Harun al-Rashid]], [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]], was passing through to quell the insurrection of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]] in [[Transoxania]], he became ill and died. He was buried under the palace of Humayd ibn Qahtaba. Thus the Dar al-Imarah was known as the Mausoleum of Haruniyyeh. In 818, Ali al-Ridha was martyred by [[al-Ma'mun]] and was buried beside the grave of Harun.<ref>Zabeth (1999) pp. 12–13.</ref> Although Mashhad owns the cultural heritage of Tus (including its figures like [[Nizam al-Mulk]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Ahmad Ghazali]], [[Ferdowsi]], [[Asadi Tusi]], and [[Shaykh Tusi]]), earlier [[Arabs|Arab]] geographers have correctly identified Mashhad and Tus as two separate cities that are now located about {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} from each other.

===Mongolian invasion: Ilkhanids===
Although some believe that after this event, the city was called Mashhad al-Ridha (the place of martyrdom of al-Ridha), it seems that Mashhad, as a place-name, first appears in al-Maqdisi, i.e., in the last third of the 10th century. About the middle of the 14th century, the traveller Ibn Battuta uses the expression "town of Mashhad al-Rida". Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the name Nuqan, which is still found on coins in the first half of the 14th century under the [[Il-Khanids]], seems to have been gradually replaced by al-Mashhad or Mashhad.
[[File:Terken Khatun-1.1.jpg|left|[[Terken Khatun (wife of Ala ad-Din Tekish)|Terken Khatun]], Empress of the Khwarazmian Empire, known as "the Queen of the Turks", held captive by Mongol army|thumb]]
[[Shias]] began to make [[Ziarat|pilgrimages]] to his grave. By the end of the 9th century, a dome was built above the grave, and many other buildings and [[bazaars]] sprang up around it. Over the course of more than a millennium, it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.<ref>Zabeth (1999) pp. 13–16.</ref> In 1161, however, the [[Seljuks]] seized the city, but they spared the sacred area their pillaging. Mashad al-Ridha was not considered a "great" city until [[Mongol raids]] in 1220, which caused the destruction of many large cities in Khurasan but leaving Mashhad relatively intact in the hands of Mongolian commanders because of the cemetery of Ali Al-Rezza and Harun al-Rashid (the latter was stolen).<ref>موسوي 1370, p. 40</ref> Thus the survivors of the massacres migrated to Mashhad.<ref name="Zabeth 1999 pp. 14-15">Zabeth (1999) pp. 14–15.</ref> When the [[Arab]] traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] visited the town in 1333, he reported that it was a large town with abundant fruit trees, streams and mills.

===Timurid Empire===
[[File:Persian(IRAN) Empire 1747.jpg|thumb|The map of the Persian Empire in 1747 at the time of Afsharid Dynasty. The name of Mashhad is seen belong Tous.]]
It seems that the importance of Sanabad-Mashhad continually increased with the growing fame of its sanctuary and the decline of Tus, which received its death-blow in 1389 from [[Miran Shah]], a son of [[Timur]]. When the Mongol noble who governed the place rebelled and attempted to make himself independent, Miran Shah was sent against him by his father. Tus was stormed after a siege of several months, sacked and left a heap of ruins; 10,000 inhabitants were massacred. Those who escaped the holocaust settled in the shelter of the 'Alid sanctuary. Tus was henceforth abandoned and Mashhad took its place as the capital of the district.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Later on, during the reign of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] [[Shahrukh Mirza]], Mashhad became one of the main cities of the realm. In 1418, his wife [[Goharshad]] funded the construction of an outstanding mosque beside the shrine, which is known as the [[Goharshad Mosque]].<ref name="Zabeth 1999 pp. 14-15"/> The mosque remains relatively intact to this date, its great size an indicator to the status the city held in the 15th century.

===Safavid Empire===
[[Ismail I]], founder of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Empire]], conquered Mashhad after the death of [[Husayn Bayqarah]] and the decline of the Timurid dynasty. He was later captured by the [[Uzbeks]] during the reign of [[Shah Abbas I]]. In the 16th century the town suffered considerably from the repeated raids of the Özbegs (Uzbeks). In 1507, it was taken by the troops of the Shaybani or Shabani Khan. After two decades, Shah Tahmasp I succeeded in repelling the enemy from the town again in 1528. But in 1544, the Özbegs again succeeded in entering the town and plundering and murdering there. The year 1589 was a disastrous one for Mashhad. The Shaybanid '[[Abd al-Mu'min]] after a four months' siege forced the town to surrender. Shah Abbas I, who lived in Mashhad from 1585 until his official ascent of the throne in Qazwin in 1587, was not able to retake Mashhad from the Özbegs until 1598. Mashhad was retaken by the Shah Abbas after a long and hard struggle, defeating the Uzbeks in a great battle near [[Herat]] as well as managing to drive them beyond the [[Oxus River]]. [[Abbas the Great]] wanted to encourage Iranians to go to Mashhad for pilgrimage. He is said to have walked from [[Isfahan]] to Mashhad. During the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era, Mashhad gained even more religious recognition, becoming the most important city of Greater Khorasan, as several [[madrasah]] and other structures were built beside the [[Imam Reza shrine]]. Besides its religious significance, Mashhad has played an important political role as well. The Safavid dynasty has been criticized in a book (Red Shi'sm vs. Black Shi'ism) on the perceived dual aspects of the Shi'a religion throughout history) as a period in which although the dynasty didn't form the idea of Black Shi'ism, but this idea was formed after the defeat of Shah Ismail against the Ottoman leader Sultan Yavuz Selim. Black Shi'ism is a product of the post-Safavid period.

===Afsharid Empire===
Mashad saw its greatest glory under [[Nader Shah]], ruler of Iran from 1736 to 1747, and also a great benefactor of the shrine of Imam Reza, who made the city his capital. Nearly the whole eastern part of the kingdom of Nadir Shah passed to foreign rulers in this period of Persian impotence under the rule of the vigorous [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]]. Ahmad defeated the Persians and took Mashhad after an eight-month siege in 1753. Ahmad Shah and his successor [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]] left [[Shah Rukh]] in possession of Khurasan as their vassal, making Khurasan a kind of buffer state between them and Persia. As the city's real rulers, however, both these Durrani rulers struck coins in Mashhad. Otherwise, the reign of the blind Shah Rukh, which with repeated short interruptions lasted for nearly half a century, passed without any events of special note. It was only after the death of Timur Shah (1792) that [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar]], the founder of the Qajar dynasty, succeeded in taking Shah Rukh's domains and putting him to death in 1795, thus ending the separation of Khurasan from the rest of Persia.

====1912 Imam Reza shrine bombardment====
In 1911 Yusuf Khan of Herat was declared independent in Mashhad as Muhammad Ali Shah and brought together a large group of [[reactionaries]] opposed to the revolution, and keep stirring for some time. This gave Russia the excuse to intervene and 29 March 1912 bombed the city; this bombing killed several people and pilgrims; action against a Muslim shrine caused a great shock to all [[Islamic countries]]. On 29 March 1912, the sanctuary of Imam Reza was bombed by the Russian artillery fire, causing some damage, including to the golden dome, resulting in a widespread and persisting resentment in the Shiite Muslim world as well as [[British India]]. This bombing was orchestrated by Prince Aristid Mikhailovich Dabizha (a [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] who was the Russian Consul in Mashhad) and [[Radko Dimitriev|General Radko]] (a [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] who was commander of the [[Cossacks#Russian Cossacks|Russian Cossacks]] in the city).<ref name="Kazemzadeh2013">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWEBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA663|title=Russia and Britain in Persia: Imperial Ambitions in Qajar Iran|last=Kazemzadeh|first=Firuz|date=10 April 2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85772-173-0|page=663}}</ref> Yusuf Khan ended up captured by the Persians and was executed.

====Modernization under Reza Shah====
[[File:Aerial view of imam reza shrine - 1976.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of imam Reza shrine, 1976]]
The modern development of the city accelerated under Reza Shah (1925-1941). Shah Reza Hospital (currently Imam Reza Hospital, affiliated with the [[Basij]] organization) was founded in 1934; the sugar factory of Abkuh in 1935; and the [[Mashhad University of Medical Sciences]] in 1939. The city's first power station was installed in 1936, and in 1939, the first urban transport service began with two buses. In this year the first population census was performed, with a result of 76,471 inhabitants.<ref name=mums>{{cite web

====1935 Goharshad Mosque rebellion====
{{main|Imam Reza shrine rebellion}}
In 1935, a backlash against the modernizing, anti-religious policies of [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]] erupted in the Mashhad shrine. Responding to a cleric who denounced the Shah's heretical innovations, corruption, and heavy consumer taxes, many bazaars and villagers took refuge in the shrine, chanted slogans such as "The Shah is a new Yazid." For four days local police and army refused to violate the shrine and the standoff was ended when troops from Azerbaijan arrived and broke into the shrine,<ref>Ervand, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.94</ref> killing dozens and injuring hundreds, and marking a final rupture between Shi'ite clergy and the Shah.<ref>Bakhash, Shaul, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs: Iran and the Islamic Revolution'' by Shaul, Bakhash, Basic Books, 1984, p. 22.</ref> According to some Mashhadi historians, the Goharshad Mosque uprising, which took place in 1935, is an uprising against Reza Shah's decree banning all veils (headscarf and chador) on 8 January 1936.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====1941–1979 reforms====
[[File:Mashhadplan.jpg|thumb|[[Comprehensive planning]] of Mashhad in 1974]]
Mashhad experienced population growth after the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Anglo-Soviet invasion]] of Iran in 1941 because of relative insecurity in rural areas, the 1948 drought, and the establishment of Mashhad University in 1949. At the same time, public transport vehicles increased to 77 buses and 200 taxis and the railway link with the capital, Tehran, was established in 1957. The 1956 census reflected a population of 241,989 people. The increase in population continued in the following years thanks to the increase in Iranian oil revenues, the decline of the feudal social model, the agrarian reform of 1963, the founding of the city's airport, the creation of new factories and the development of the health system. In 1966, the population reached 409,616 inhabitants, and 667,770 in 1976. The extension of the city was expanded from {{convert|16|to|33|km2|sqft|abbr=off}}.

In 1965 an important urban renewal development project for the surroundings of the shrine of Imam Reza was proposed by the Iranian architect and urban designer [[Dariush Borbor]] to replace the dilapidated slum conditions which surrounded the historic monuments. The project was officially approved in 1968. In 1977 the surrounding areas were demolished to make way for the implementation of this project. To relocate the demolished businesses, a new bazaar was designed and constructed in Meydan-e Ab square (in Persian, "میدان آب")<ref name="mums"/> by [[Dariush Borbor]]. After the revolution, the urban renewal project was abandoned.

===Religion===
{{See also|Imam Reza shrine}}
Today, the holy shrine and its museum hold one of the most extensive cultural and artistic treasuries of Iran, in particular manuscript books and paintings. Several important [[theological]] schools are associated with the shrine of the Eighth [[Imam]].

The second-largest holy city in the world, Mashhad attracts more than 20 million tourists and pilgrims every year, many of whom come to pay homage to the [[Imam Reza shrine]] (the eighth [[Shi'ite]] Imam). It has been a magnet for travellers since medieval times.<ref name="Imam Reza"/> Thus, even as those who complete the pilgrimage to Mecca receive the title of ''Haji'', those who make the pilgrimage to Mashhad—and especially to the Imam Reza shrine—are known as ''Mashtee'', a term employed also of its inhabitants. As an important problem, the duration when new passengers stay in Mashhad has been considerably reduced to 2 days nowadays and they prefer to finish their trip immediately after doing pilgrimage and shopping in the markets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.mashhad.ir/news/47876-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%AF-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B4-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA.html|title=-نصف-اقامت-مسافران-یزد-کاشان-کاهش-یافت|work=Masshad News|language=fa|access-date=22 December 2016|archive-date=4 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204015252/http://news.mashhad.ir/news/47876-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%AF-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B4-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are about 3000–5000 unauthorized residential units in Mashhad,<ref>[https://www.farsnews.ir/news/13910923000693/%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%E2%80%8C5-%D9%87%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%BA%DB%8C%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%E2%80%8C%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF%E2%80%8C-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%87 Unallowable places] farsnews.ir</ref> which, as a unique statistic worldwide, has caused various problems in the city.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
