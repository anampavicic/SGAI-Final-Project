Hamedan is believed to be among the oldest Iranian cities. It was referred to in classical sources as [[Ecbatana]] ([[Old Persian]] {{Lang|peo-Latn|Hamgmatāna}}). It is possible that it was occupied by the [[Assyria]]ns in 1100{{nbsp}}BCE; the Ancient Greek historian, [[Herodotus]], states that it was the capital of the [[Medes]], around 700{{nbsp}}BCE.

Hamedan is situated in a green mountainous area in the foothills of the 3,574-meter Alvand Mountain, in midwestern Iran. The city is 1,850{{nbsp}}meters [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It is located approximately {{convert|360|km|-1|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Tehran]].

The old city and its historic sites attract tourists during the summer. The major sights of this city are the [[Ganj Nameh]] inscription, the [[Avicenna]] monument and the [[Baba Taher]] monument.

==History==
{{further|Ecbatana|Timeline of Hamedan}}
[[File:Matrakçı Nasuh Hamedan Map.JPG|thumb|right|180px|16th century map of Hamedan by [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]]]According to [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]], "Hamedan is a very old city. It may conceivably, but improbably, be mentioned in cuneiform texts from ca. 1100{{nbsp}}BC, the time of Assyrian King [[Tiglath-pilesar I]], but is certainly mentioned by Herodotus who says that the king of Media Diokes built the city of [[Ecbatana|Agbatana]] or Ekbatana in the 7th century{{nbsp}}BC."<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World|year=2008|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&q=Hamedan+3000+BC&pg=PA151|page=151}}</ref>

Hamedan was established by the [[Medes]]. It then became one of several capital cities of the [[Achaemenid Dynasty]].

Hamedan is mentioned in the biblical [[book of Ezra]] ([[Ezra 6:2]]) as the place where a scroll was found giving the Jews permission from King Darius to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. Its ancient name of Ecbatana is used in the Ezra text. Because it was a mile above sea level, it was a good place to preserve leather documents.

During the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] era, [[Ctesiphon]] was the capital of the country, and Hamedan was the summer capital and residence of the Parthian rulers. After the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], the [[Sassanids]] constructed their summer palaces in this city. In 642 the [[Battle of Nahavand]] took place and Hamedan fell into the hands of the Muslim Arabs.

During the rule of the [[Buyid dynasty]], the city suffered much damage. However, the city regained its former glory under the rule of the [[Buyid]] ruler [[Fanna Khusraw]]. The [[Seljuks]] launched campaigns to take the city in the 1040s,<ref>C. E. Bosworth, “ABŪ KĀLĪJĀR GARŠĀSP (I),” [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], I/3, p. 328; an updated version is available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-kalijar-garsasp-i-ala-al-dawla-second-son-of-the-kakuyid-amir-of-jebal-ala-al-dawla-mohammad-b  (accessed on 23 January 2024).</ref> ultimately taking the final Kakuyid fortress in 1047.<ref>C.

In 1220, Hamedan was destroyed by the [[Mongols]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hamedan {{!}} Iran {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Hamedan|access-date=2022-01-16|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref> during the [[Mongol invasions of Georgia]] before the [[Battle of Khunan]]. The city of Hamedan, its fortunes following the rise and fall of regional powers, was completely destroyed during the [[Timurid conquests and invasions|Timurid invasions]], but later thrived during the [[Safavid]] era.[[File:Drachma Mithradates II.jpg|thumb|Silver drachma of Parthian king [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]], made in [[Ecbatana]] mint|right]]

Thereafter, in the 18th century, Hamedan was surrendered to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], but due to the work of [[Nader Shah]], Hamedan was cleared of invaders and, as a result of a peace treaty between Iran and the Ottomans, it was returned to Iran. Hamedan stands on the [[Silk Road]], and even in recent centuries the city enjoyed strong commerce and trade as a result of its location on the main road network in the western region of Iran. In the late 19th century, American missionaries, including [[James Hawkes (missionary)|James W. Hawkes]] and Belle Sherwood Hawke,<ref>[https://www.in.gov/library/fa_index/fa_by_letter/h/s60.html James W.

During [[World War I]], the city was the scene of heavy fighting between Russian and Turko-German forces. It was occupied by both armies, and finally by the British, before it was returned to the control of the Iranian government at the end of the war in 1918.
