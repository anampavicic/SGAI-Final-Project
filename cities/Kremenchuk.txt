'''Kremenchuk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|r|ɛ|m|ə|n|ˈ|tʃ|uː|k|,_|ˌ|k|r|ɪ|m|ɪ|n|ˈ|-}}; {{langx|uk|Кременчук}}, {{IPA|uk|kremenˈtʃuk|IPA|audio=Uk-Кременчук.ogg}}, also spelt '''Kremenchug''') is an industrial city in central [[Ukraine]] which stands on the banks of the [[Dnieper|Dnieper River]]. The city serves as the [[administrative center]] of [[Kremenchuk Raion]] and [[Kremenchuk urban hromada]] within [[Poltava Oblast]].<ref name="admreform_2020_kremenchuk_city">{{cite web |title=Кременчугская городская громада |url=https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/kremenchuk/ |publisher=Портал об'єднаних громад України |language=ru}}</ref> Its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2022|215,271|,}} ranking 31st in Ukraine. In 2001, the Ukrainian government included the city in the list of historical settlements.<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 July 2021 |title=Про затвердження Списку історичних населених місць України |url=http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/878-2001-%D0%BF |url-status=bot: unknown |access-date=13 April 2023 |website=zakon2.rada.gov.ua |archive-date=29 December 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121229130729/http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/878-2001-%D0%BF }}</ref>

Although not as large as some oblast centers, Kremenchuk has a large industrial center in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. A [[KrAZ]] truck plant, the [[Kremenchuk Oil Refinery]] of [[Ukrtatnafta]], the [[KVBZ|Kriukiv Railway Car Building Works]], and [[Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Power Plant]], in nearby [[Svitlovodsk]], are located in or near Kremenchuk. [[Highway M22 (Ukraine)|Highway M22]] crosses the Dnieper over the dam of the power plant.

Originally established on the left bank, Kremenchuk eventually incorporated the city of {{ill|Kriukiv|uk|Крюків}} on the right bank. The Kriukiv Railway Car Building Works is one of the oldest railway-repair and rail-car-building factories in Eastern Europe, dating from 1869.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kvsz.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1&lang=en |work=Kryukov Rail Car Building Works Home Page |title=Kryukov Railway Car Building Works |access-date=2014-10-03 |archive-date=2014-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006113217/http://www.kvsz.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1&lang=en |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
Kremenchuk was founded in 1571 as a fortress.<ref>Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia. Encyclopedia Britannica, 2 August 2010, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Kremenchuk Kremenchuk]. Accessed 27 June 2022.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://dspace.nbuv.gov.ua/handle/123456789/32684 |title=Early history of Kremenchug |journal=Dspace.nbuv.gov.ua |year=2011 |last1=Вирський |first1=Д.}}</ref> The name Kremenchuk is explained as deriving from the word "kremen" - [[flint]] (a mineral) because the city is located on a giant chert plate. An alternative explanation says that "Kremenchuk" is the Turkish for "small fortress".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 1625, at [[Lake Kurukove]] in Kremenchuk, the [[Treaty of Kurukove]] was signed between [[Cossacks]] and the [[Poland|Poles]]. Since the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]], the city was part of the [[Chyhyryn Regiment|Chyhyryn Polk]] (regiment). Following the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]] and [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], the city was secured by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and became part of the Myrhorod Polk (regiment) within the left-bank of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. The city played a key role in the Russian colonization policy of Ukraine and their striving for the shores of Black Seas as regional administrative center of the early [[Novorossiya Governorate]] and [[Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty|Yekaterinoslav Vice-regency]] (Namestnichestvo).<ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CR%5CKremenchuk.htm Kremenchuk]. [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]</ref> With the creation of Novorossiya Governorate, the Dnieper Pikemen Regiment ({{langx|ru|Днепровский пикинёрный полк}}) was created and coincidentally a few years later (1768–69) in the neighboring regions of Poland began the [[Koliyivshchyna]]. Here in 1786 the Russian general [[Alexander Suvorov]] started his military career when he was appointed a commander of the local garrison (in preparation of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|1787–1792 Russo-Turkish War]]).
[[File:Кременчук Держбанк.jpg|thumb|left|Kremenchuk, XIX]]
Following defeat in the [[Crimean War]] began the installation of a network of railroads in Russia, and in 1869 in Kryukiv were built small railcar repair shops, while in 1872 the city of Kriukiv was connected with Kremenchuk by a railroad bridge over the [[Dnieper]]. In 1870 in Kremenchuk a factory was built that produced and maintained agrarian equipment and iron cast products. In 1899 a network of [[tram]]way transportation was introduced in Kremenchuk that existed until the complete establishment of Soviet regime in Ukraine in 1921.

During the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917, power in the city was controlled by a council (soviet) of workers' deputies which was dominated by the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] and the head of the city council was the future Ukrainian Communist leader {{ill|Yuriy Lapchynskyi|uk|Лапчинський Юрій Федорович}}. During the [[Ukrainian–Soviet War]], on 26 January 1918, Russian Bolshevik troops secured the city, however already in February of the same year they had to withdraw due to the treaty of Brest-Litovsk and advance of German and Ukrainian armies. Following the [[World War I]] hostilities between the Bolshevik Russia and Ukraine renewed and on 1 February 1919 the Russian Red Army once again secured the city. However, in May of the same year Kremechuk was engulfed in the insurgency of Otaman Grigoriev who earlier sided with Bolsheviks and drove the international force of Triple Entante from Odesa. From July to December 1919 the city was occupied by the Russian "White Guard" troops of [[Anton Denikin]]. Following their withdrawal, the Denikin's troops blew up the railroad bridge.

In 1920–1922, the city was the administrative center of the short-lived {{ill|Kremenchuk Governorate|uk|Кременчуцька губернія}} during a peasant insurgency (Kholodnyi Yar) near [[Chyhyryn]] (just west of the city). During the 1930s, Kremenchuk's industry was transformed, its Kriukiv railcar repair shops became a railcar manufacturing factory, while its factory in production of agrarian equipment changed to manufacturing road equipment.

During [[World War II]] (1939–1945), Kremenchuk suffered heavily under [[Nazi]] occupation. It was occupied from 15 September 1941, to 29 September 1943. More than 90% of the city's buildings were leveled over the course of the war.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shirochin |first=Semen |date=2022-07-27 |title=Ось як крізь роки виглядає Кременчук, який на війні знищують вже вдруге |url=https://zaborona.com/os-yak-kriz-roky-vyglyadaye-kremenchuk-yakyj-na-vijni-znyshhuyut-vzhe-vdruge/ |access-date=2023-04-13 |website=Заборона |language=uk}}</ref> 29 September, the day when the city was liberated from the Nazis in 1943, is celebrated in Kremenchuk as City Day. Despite a remarkable post-war recovery and a healthier economy, Kremenchuk lacks much of the architectural charm and distinctly Ukrainian (rather than Russian) character of its sister city, the oblast capital of [[Poltava]].

During the Cold War, Kremenchuk became the headquarters for the 43rd Rocket Division of the 43rd Army of the Soviet [[Strategic Rocket Forces]].<ref>Mike Holm, ''Strategic Rocket Forces'', see SRF page</ref> The division was equipped with [[R-12 Dvina]] [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]].{{dubious|date=November 2013}}

In 1975 the city of Kryukiv was merged with Kremenchuk, while Kremenchuk was divided in two raions in city.

In 2014 during the mass [[demolition of monuments to Vladimir Lenin in Ukraine]], in the city were removed two monuments of the Russian Communist leader in the city center and near the Kryukiv Railcar Factory.

[[Oleh Babayev]], the mayor of Kremenchuk was assassinated on 26 July 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/attacks-kill-ukraine-mayor-oleg-babayev-bomb-andrii-sadovyis-house/story-fnh81p7g-1227002879797 |title=Attacks kill Ukraine mayor Oleg Babayev, bomb Andrii Sadovyi's house |work=NewsComAu, www.news.com.au |access-date=2014-08-03 |archive-date=2015-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503112327/http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/attacks-kill-ukraine-mayor-oleg-babayev-bomb-andrii-sadovyis-house/story-fnh81p7g-1227002879797 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Oleh Babayev opposed separatism and promoted national unity, prior to becoming mayor he was a member of the [[Batkivshchyna]] political party which opposed Victor Yanukovich. His political views and Kremenchuk's large industrial base may have been the motivation for the attack.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

During the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] security at the [[Kremenchuk Reservoir]] was heightened as it was seen as a possible target for saboteurs.<ref>{{cite web |author=Подробности-ТВ |date=17 March 2014 |title=Самооборона взялась за охрану Кременчугского водохранилища от браконьеров |work=podrobnosti |url=http://podrobnosti.ua/podrobnosti/2014/03/17/965054.html}}</ref>

Until 18 July 2020, Kremenchuk was designated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and did not belong to Kremenchuk Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Poltava Oblast to four, the city was merged into Kremenchuk Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

During the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Kremenchuk has been under attack by Russian forces. On 27 April and 12 May an oil refinery was hit by Russian missiles and will be out of operation for months.

== Jewish community and Holocaust ==
Jews initially began to settle in the city in 1782, and by 1801, there were 454 registered taxpayers in Kremenchuk. As a result of Jewish emigration from further north in the Pale of Settlement, many Jews from northern provinces settled in the city in the mid-19th century. The community had grown sevenfold within a half decade to 3,475 by 1847.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Kremenchug |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/kremenchug |access-date=2023-05-24 |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref> The [[Russian Empire census|1897 All-Russia Census]] recorded the Jewish population of Kremenchuk at 29,768, or at 47% of the total population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Community Finder - Kremenchuk |url=https://www.jewishgen.org/Communities/Community.php?usbgn=-1043663 |access-date=24 May 2023 |website=Jewishgen.org}}</ref> Growth of the city's Jewish population stagnated, still hovering at 28,969 by 1926, around 50% of the population, later heavily falling to 19,880 by 1939.

[[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi forces occupied Kremenchuk]] on 9 September 1941, setting restrictions on Jewish purchases and forcing them to wear the [[Yellow badge|Yellow Star of Jude]]. On 27 September 1941, they were exiled from the city, and forced to move into the Ghetto in Novo-Ivanovka.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[:uk:Новоіванівка (Лубенський район)|uk]]]</sup><ref name=":0" /> Many Jews who hid throughout the city were later caught and forced into the Ghettos as well. Between October 1941 and January 1942, a total of around 8,000 Jews were shot and killed in various instances of execution over the months, although the community was not entirely wiped out. The Ghetto and town were liberated 29 September 1943 by the [[Red Army]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Untold Stories - Kremenchug |url=https://collections.yadvashem.org/en/untold-stories/community/14621763-Kremenchug |access-date=24 May 2023 |website=Yad Vashem}}</ref> A Jewish community of over 5,000 remained in the city throughout the 1950s, although dwindled in the 1990s during [[1990s post-Soviet aliyah|migration to Israel]].<ref name=":0" />

There are a few Jewish cemeteries from different parts of the 20th century in the area, with the last burials having occurred in Jewish Cemetery II in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=KREMENCHUG {{!}} Ukraine {{!}} International Jewish Cemetery Project |url=http://iajgscemetery.org/eastern-europe/ukraine/kremenchug |access-date=2023-05-24 |website=IAJGS Cemetery Project |language=en-gb}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Центральная проходная завода КрАЗ.jpg|thumb|[[KrAZ]] automobile plant]]
Kremenchuk is the economic center of the [[Poltava Oblast]] and one of the leading industrial centers of Ukraine. {{As of|2005}}, it contributed about 7 percent of the national economy and accounted for more than 50 percent of the industrial output in Poltava Oblast.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}} The city is home to [[KrAZ]], a truck-manufacturing company (one of the largest in [[Eastern Europe]]) as well as a major European oil refinery operated by [[Ukrtatnafta]], the road-making machine works, {{ill|Kremenchuk Automobile Assembly Plant|uk|Кременчуцький автоскладальний завод}}, the Kryukivsky Car Manufacturing Plant, train railway rolling stock wagons, the wheel plant, the [[carbon black]] plant, the steel works and others.

The light industries of the city include tobacco ([[Japan Tobacco|JTI]]), confectionery ([[Roshen]]), a knitting factory as well as milk and meat processing plants.

Kremenchuk is one of the most important railway junctions in Central Ukraine (thanks to its geographical position and a [[bridge]] over the Dnieper River) and a major river port on the main river of Ukraine.
