'''Morelia''' ({{IPA|es|moˈɾelja}}; from 1545 to 1828 known as '''Valladolid''', [[Otomi language|Otomi]]: {{Lang|ote|Mänxuni}}) is a city and [[municipal seat]] of the [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] of Morelia in the north-central part of the state of [[Michoacán]] in central Mexico.<ref name="turiguia">{{cite book | last1=Sanchez Reyna |first1=Ramon |title= Michoacán:Morelia, Pátzcuaro, Cuitzeo, Zamora, Uruapan, Otros |year=2008 |publisher= Grupo Azabache, S.A. de C.V. |location= Mexico City |language=es |isbn=978-607-7568-08-7 |pages=20–28}}</ref> The city is in the Guayangareo Valley and is the capital and largest city of the state. The main pre-Hispanic cultures here were the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] and the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]], but no major cities were founded in the valley during this time. The [[New Spain|Spanish]] took control of the area in the 1520s. The Spanish under [[Viceroy]] [[Antonio de Mendoza]] founded a settlement here in 1541 with the name of Valladolid, which became rival to the nearby city of [[Pátzcuaro]] for dominance in Michoacán. In 1580, this rivalry ended in Valladolid's favor, and it became the capital of the [[Viceroy|viceregal province]]. After the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the city was renamed Morelia in honor of [[José María Morelos]], who hailed from the city. In 1991, the city was declared a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] for its well-preserved historical buildings and layout of the historic center. It is tradition to name people born on September 30 after the city.

The city population in 2020 was 743,275 inhabitants. The municipality had 849,053 inhabitants, and the Metropolitan Area, composed of Morelia, Tarímbaro, and Charo municipalities, had 988,704 inhabitants, according to the XIV Census.<ref name = Pop>{{cite web | url=http://www.microrregiones.gob.mx/zap/datGenerales.aspx?entra=nacion&ent=16&mun=053 |language=es |title= Datos Generales: Municipio: Morelia |work=Unidad de Microrregiones|publisher= Secretaría de Desarrollo Social |access-date= February 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name="encmuc">{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán Morelia

==History==
[[File:Jardin de las rosas.JPG|thumb|left|Jardin de las Rosas Garden and Park]]
[[File:Calle del centro de morelia.jpg|thumb|right|Street and [[Cathedral of Morelia]] ]]

Human settlements in the [[Guayangareo Valley]] in which Morelia is located have been dated back as far as the 7th century. Artifacts found here have shown [[Teotihuacán]] culture influence on early cultures in this area. In the 12th century, the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] arrived in the valley. They dominated it politically for the rest of the pre-Hispanic period but did not build any major settlements here. Between the 12th and the 15th centuries, Matlatzincas moved into the area with permission of the Purépechas, who were based around nearby Pátzcuaro Lake <ref name="tbnPatzcuaro">{{cite web|url=https://www.tusbuenasnoticias.com/mexico/general/michoacan-plantara-15-millones-de-arboles-para-salvar-lago-de-patzcuaro/34460 |title=¡Qué buena noticia!

The main Matlatzinca settlement was where Júarez Plaza in the city is today.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="ahistoria">{{cite web|url=http://www.morelia.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=77 |title=Historia |publisher=H.Ayuntamiento de Morelia |location=Morelia, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=2009-11-21 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428193616/http://www.morelia.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=77 |archive-date=April 28, 2009 }}</ref>

The Spanish pushed into the Guayangareo Valley between 1525 and 1526, headed by Gonzalo Gómez. In the 1530s, the area was evangelized by [[Franciscans]] such as Juan de San Miguel and Antonio de Lisboa.<ref name="encmuc"/>

What would become the city of Morelia was founded by Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza and a number of [[encomenderos]] in 1541, who first named it Nueva Ciudad de Michoacán (New City of Michoacán). The newly founded settlement grew quickly, prompting [[Vasco de Quiroga]] to go to Spain and procure for rival settlement Pátzcuaro the title of city and a seal, to prevent the “new city” from becoming the capital of Michoacán. The action also required that the new settlement change its name to Guayangareo.<ref name="turiguia"/> In 1545, Guayangareo gained city status from Charles V with the name of "Valladolid," after [[Valladolid, Spain|the hometown]] of Antonio de Mendoza.<ref name="ahistoria"/> This was part of a power struggle between Antonio de Mendoza and Vasco de Quiroga over the province of Michoacán. During Quiroga's lifetime, he managed to keep political and ecclesiastical power in Pátzcuaro despite the viceroy's and encomenderos’ objections. Quiroga died in 1565, however, and by 1580, both political and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Morelia|religious authority]] ([[Episcopal see]]) had been transferred to the city of Valladolid, moving the College of San Nicolás, which Vasco founded and laying the groundwork for establishing a new cathedral for the province.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The 17th century saw growth for Valladolid, with the construction of the cathedral and aqueduct. The cathedral was begun in 1640 (finished in 1744) and the aqueduct in 1657.<ref name="encmuc"/> Both of these structures would later be worked on in the 18th century by Master Architect of Valladolid, [[Diego Durán (Architect)|Diego Durán]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=von Germeten |first1=Nicole |title=Black Blood Brothers: Confraternities and Social Mobility for Afro-Mexicans |date=2006 |publisher=The University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville |isbn=0-8130-2942-2 |pages=119–121}}</ref> During the 17th century, many of the city's large churches and monasteries were established, such as the monasteries of San Francisco, San Agustin, El Carmen, and La Merced as well as the convents of Las Rosas, Las Monjas and Capuchinas. Churches include La Compañía, San Juan, and La Cruz, but the most important structure built during this time period was the cathedral. The location of this cathedral defined the composition and development of the city from then on.<ref name="mexdesmor">{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/2468-El-Centro-Hist%F3rico-de-Morelia,-Michoac%E1n |title=El Centro Histórico de Morelia, Michoacán |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=The Historic Center of Morelia, Michoacan |access-date=2009-11-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

At the end of the viceregal period, Valladolid was a small city with about 20,000 inhabitants. It was also an educational center with four important schools such as the College of San Nicolás. These schools would turn out scholars such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and [[José María Morelos|José María Morelos y Pavón]], who were sympathetic to the new republican ideas coming out of [[French Revolution|post-revolution France]] and the United States.<ref name="turiguia"/><ref name="mexdesmor"/> Demonstrations against Spanish rule had been occurring in the town in 1809, culminating in the Conspiracy of 1809. This plot was discovered, with the main conspirators were arrested and sent to other parts of New Spain, which helped to spread republican ideas.<ref name="ahistoria"/>

One year later, after forming his army in [[Guanajuato]] state, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] arrived and took over the city, proclaiming the end of slavery in Mexico. The city was taken back by royalist forces soon after. Morelos came here to try and dislodge the royalists but was defeated by [[Agustín de Iturbide]]. Another prominent figure in the war, [[Mariano Matamoros]] was shot by firing squad on the city's main square in 1814. The city remained in royalist's hands until 1821, Iturbide, who had switched sides, and [[Vicente Guerrero]] entered the city with the [[Army of the Three Guarantees|Trigarante Army]].<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="ahistoria"/>

In 1828, the newly created state of Michoacán changed the name of the city from Valladolid to Morelia, in honor of [[José María Morelos|José María Morelos y Pavón]]. This is the official name it retains today, although its Purépecha name remains Uaianarhio and has had nicknames such as City of Pink (Cantera) Stone, the City of Open Doors, The Rose of the Winds, The Garden of [[New Spain]] and religiously as Morelia of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref name="ahistoria"/> The city became a municipality in 1831.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The later 19th century is marked by struggles between liberal and conservatives forces in Mexico. During the [[Revolution of Ayutla]], the city was taken by rebel forces under Epitacio Huerta and General García Pueblita, but was taken back in 1855 by forces under [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]. Rebels attacked Santa Anna's troops again a year later.<ref name="ahistoria"/> French troops imposing imperial rule entered the city in 1863, with the republican forces moving the capital of Michoacán to [[Uruapan]] while conservative families in Morelia pledged support for emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], who then visited the city. In 1867, the city was taken by republican general Nicolás de Régules and the capital of Michoacán returned to Morelia.<ref name="encmuc"/> In 1869, during a rebellion against [[Benito Juárez]]’s government, General Epitacio Huerta attacked government positions in the city but were beaten back by forces under [[Mariano Escobedo]].<ref name="ahistoria"/>

[[File: Filling water jars at a fountain in Morelia, Mexico (1906).jpg|thumb|right|Filling water jars at a fountain in Morelia, 1906]]
The first factories were opened in the city between 1868 and 1870, along with the first [[telegraph]] line. The railroad followed in 1883, as well as streetcars.<ref name="ahistoria"/>

In 1910, celebrations are held for the centennial of Independence but tensions are high in the city due to the shortage of grain and the continuation of President [[Porfirio Diaz]] in power. One year later, revolutionaries loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] are welcomed into the city.<ref name="encmuc"/> In 1914, the capital was moved from Morelia to the city of [[Tacámbaro]]. The city was then taken by forces under General Sánchez in the same year, and by forces loyal to [[Francisco Villa]] in 1915.<ref name="ahistoria"/>

In 1920, the Palace of the State Government was briefly taken over by farmworkers and others from all over the state. Isaac Arriaga is assassinated here in 1921. The city is attacked again by rebels calling themselves “Delahuertistas” in 1924. The fight mostly occurs in the main plaza with the city defended by General Lopez, Garcia, and Avila Camacho.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Morelia was the location for the 1958 film ''[[The Bravados]]'' starring [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Joan Collins]].  Filming was difficult because it was unusually rainy and cold for the region.

During the 1960s the street vendors were removed from the historic center of the city, and palm trees that lined the Avenida Madero, the main east-west road, were cut down. In 1966, there was a student revolt at the state university which was put down by the army.<ref name="ahistoria"/>

The 1970s and 1980s are marked by construction including the Periferico bypass ring around the city.<ref name="ahistoria"/> During the 1980s, damage due to geographic faults, exacerbated by falling water tables from groundwater pumping is noticed. This problem is similar to problems faced by other cities on the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] such as [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]] and [[Mexico City]].<ref name="scdirect">{{cite journal |last=Avila-Olivera |first=Jorge A. |author2=Victor H.

In 1991, the city was declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site due to its well-preserved architecture. In 2001, street vendors were moved again from the historic center to make the area more tourist-friendly. Traffic was rerouted from here as well with the construction of new bypasses. In 2006 and 2007, many of the plazas and gardens in the historic center were remodeled.<ref name="ahistoria"/>

In 2008, eight people [[Morelia grenade attacks|were killed]] in a [[grenade]] attack.

In 2009, the Morelia metropolitan area was tentatively established as consisting of the municipalities of [[Zinapécuaro]], [[Álvaro Obregón, Michoacán|Álvaro Obregón]], [[Charo, Michoacán|Charo]], Tarímbaro and Morelia. This initial determination was made by the Secretary of Urbanism and Environment, with further refinements to be made as the municipal presidents of these entities meets to discuss limits, strategies and further actions.<ref name="leon">{{cite news |title= Avanzados los trámites para ampliar la zona metropolitana de Morelia: SUMA |first=Gladis |last=Leon Gonzalez |url=http://www.lajornadamichoacan.com.mx/2009/05/25/index.php?section=politica&article=006n1pol |newspaper=La Jornada Michoacan |location=Morelia, Mexico |date=2009-05-25 |access-date=2009-11-21 |language=es |trans-title=Advances in the paperwork to amplify the metropolitana rea of Morelia: SUMA }}</ref> One of these actions has been to establish a formal commission to administer the area.<ref name="trabaja">{{cite web |url=http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/SUMA/Unifican_criterios_para_la_zona_metropolitana_de_Morelia |title=Unifican criterios para la zona metropolitana de Morelia State of Michoacán |date=2009-07-28 |publisher=State of Michoacan |language=es |trans-title=Unify criteria for the metropolitana rea of Morelia |access-date=2009-11-21 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920055510/http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/SUMA/Unifican_criterios_para_la_zona_metropolitana_de_Morelia |archive-date=2010-09-20 }}</ref>

== Population ==
The city of Morelia is the most populous city in the state of [[Michoacán]] and the third most important in the [[Bajío]] Region, just behind [[León, Guanajuato|León de Los Aldama]] and [[Querétaro City]].
In the most recent census carried out by [[Inegi]] in 2020 the city registered a population of 743,275 inhabitants, an increase of almost 145,000 inhabitants over the previous census carried out in 2010 when it had a population of 597,511.

==Notable sites==
[[File:MoreliaSignCathedral.jpg|thumb|City Sign at Cathedral Plaza]]
Almost all of Morelia's notable sites lie in its historic center. This historic center is roughly equivalent to the original layout of the city when it was founded in 1541, and most of this layout has survived intact to the present day. Anticipating growth, this original layout had very wide streets and plazas for the time, with streets systematically arranged to allow for elongation. The streets are systematically laid out, but not rigidly squared, with most having gentle curves designed into them. Most of the grandest structures were completed during the 18th century, including the facade and bell towers of the cathedral, the Colegio Seminario (today the State Government Palace), La Alhóndiga (today part of the Palace of Justice) and numerous private mansions. During the same time period, infrastructure such as the city's aqueduct and various plaza fountains were constructed. The Mexican federal government lists 1,113 buildings built from the 16th to the 20th centuries as having historical value. The buildings encompass the various architectural styles that have been fashionable in Mexico, but nearly all are built of pink Cantera stone, which gives the city a unified appearance. Several measures were taken in the 20th century to preserve this part of the city. In 1956, the city enacted regulations to preserve the historic center's colonial buildings. In 1990, President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] issued a decree making the historic center of Morelia a national historic monument. In 1991, the same area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO,<ref name="mexdesmor"/> which covers 200 of the area's historic buildings.<ref name="britanicamich">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/380156/Michoacan |title= Michoacán de Ocampo |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |trans-title=Cathedral |access-date=2009-11-21 }}</ref>

[[File:Catedral of morelia.JPG|thumb|[[Morelia Cathedral]]]]
The heart of the historic center is the cathedral and its surrounding plazas: the Plaza de Armas, also known as the Plaza de los Mártires, the Juárez Plaza and the Melchor Ocampo Plaza. The largest plaza is the Plaza de Armas, which has been remodeled several times since it was designed in the 16th century. It has been renamed several times as well, from “de la Constitución,” “de la República” to the current official name of “de los Mártires” but popularly it retains the name of “Plaza de Armas.”<ref name="turiguia"/> The alternate name, Plaza de los Mártires (Plaza of the Martyrs) is in honor of people like Mariano Matamoros, Guadalupe el Salto and others who were executed here during the Mexican War of Independence and later in 1830 during political unrest.<ref name="raices">{{cite web|url=http://www.folklorico.com/lugares/plaza-de-armas-morelia.html |title=Morelia, Michoacán-Plaza de Armas |first=David |last=Rojas |publisher=Instituto Cultural “Raices Mexicancas” |language=es |access-date=2009-11-21 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530014052/http://www.folklorico.com/lugares/plaza-de-armas-morelia.html |archive-date=May 30, 2009 }}</ref> The plaza is surrounded by portals,<ref name="mexdesmor"/> and colonial era buildings such as the Banca Promex, the Virrey de Mendoza Hotel, the Juan de Dios Gomez House and the old town hall, also called the Michelena House.<ref name="raices"/> Until the late 19th century, a monument to Morelos had been here, but this was removed along with the fountain and replaced by a [[kiosk]] that was brought from London and remains to this day. The last remodeling of the plaza occurred in the mid-20th century under the direction of architect and painter [[Juan O'Gorman]]. The [[Melchor Ocampo]] Plaza was originally named “Plaza de la Paz.” In the late 19th century, this plaza was remodeled and a monument to Ocampo sculpted by [[Primitivo Miranda]] was placed here. Another statue by Miranda, this one of Jose Maria Morelos y Pavon was placed in the small plaza on the west side of the cathedral and named the Morelos Plaza.<ref name="turiguia"/>

The first church on the Cathedral site was built in 1577, which was a modest structure of adobe and wood. Many years later, this structure would be almost completely destroyed by a fire.<ref name="turiguia"/> Originally, the Cathedral of Michoacán was in Pátzcuaro in a church that now is the Basilica of Nuestra Señora de la Salud. When cathedral status was moved from there to Valladolid in 1580, the city became the civil, religious, and cultural capital of the territory.<ref name="raices"/> In 1660, Bishop Marcos Ramírez del Prado, placed the first stone of the new cathedral, which was designed by Vicenzo Barocco. Of the major churches of the early colonial period, only this and the [[Mexico City Cathedral]] do not face west, as was customary. The Cathedral of Michoacán is also unique in that it is dedicated to the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]], rather than some form of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The cathedral was consecrated in 1705, even though it was not yet finished. The facade as a relief of the Transfiguration of Christ and the east [[nave]] is dedicated to the sheepherders and [[Biblical Magi|Wise Men]] of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].<ref name="turiguia"/> Built of pink Cantera stone, the cathedral's two {{convert|60|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} towers still dominate the skyline of the city,<ref name="sacred">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/mexico/morelia-cathedral.htm |title=Morelia Cathedral, Morelia |publisher=Sacred Destinations |access-date=2009-11-21 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713220845/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/mexico/morelia-cathedral.htm |archive-date=2009-07-13 }}</ref> and are the second tallest Baroque towers in Mexico.<ref name="visitcatedral">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmichoacan.com.mx/attractions/?id=45 |title=Catedral |publisher=State of Michoacan |language=es |trans-title=Cathedral |access-date=2009-11-21 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618005909/http://www.visitmichoacan.com.mx/attractions/?id=45 |archive-date=2009-06-18 }}</ref>
[[File:DecoratedPlazanexttoCathedralMorelia.jpg|thumb|Decorated Plaza next to Cathedral in Morelia]]
The cathedral's official name is Cathedral of the Divine Savior of Morelia. Since it was built over the 17th and 18th centuries, elements of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], Herreresque, and [[Baroque architecture]] can be seen in the building.<ref name="sacred"/> The facade of the cathedral is mostly decorated in [[pilaster]]s rather than columns and relieves rather than sculptures. There are more than two hundred pilasters but no columns, the only church built this way during the colonial period.<ref name="mexdesmor"/>

Inside, there are a number of elements that stand out. The [[baptismal font]] was made of silver in the 19th century and was used to baptize Mexico's first emperor, Agustín de Iturbide. A {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall|spell=in|sp=us}} monstrance made of pure silver adorns the main altar and is unique in that it can be disassembled and reassembled. Also on the altar is a 16th-century cornstalk paste image of the Señor de la Sacristía (Lord of the [[Sacristy]]), whose gold crown was a gift from [[Philip II of Spain]]. A newer addition is the organ from Germany, which has 4,600 pipes and is one of the largest in Latin America. On Saturdays at 8:45&nbsp; pm the cathedral sponsors a sound-and-light show.<ref name="sacred"/><ref name="visitcatedral"/>

In front of the cathedral is the old Seminario Tridentino de San Pedro, one of the educational institutions of the colonial city. Today it is the Palace of the State Government. It was constructed by Thomás de Huerta in the late 18th century. The school had graduates such as José María Morelos and Melchor Ocampo. The facade is mostly original, with only the [[coat of arms of Mexico|seal of Mexico]] having been added in the mid-19th century, when this building was converted for use as the seat of the Michoacán state government. Inside are three courtyards with the walls of the first courtyard covered in murals done by [[Alfredo Zalce]] in the 1960s.<ref name="turiguia"/>

Traslado de las Monjas in the museum of the Casa de la Cultura is also the home of the Instituto Michoacano de Cultura (Michoacan Institute of Culture) and the State Secretary of Culture. It is in the former monastery of Nuestra Señora del Carmen Descalzo, which was established in 1593. The church building was probably finished in 1619, the date inscribed on the south portal, but monastery construction continued into the 17th century. In the 19th century, the [[Reform War|Reform Laws]] expropriated the [[cloister]]s and living quarters but left the church to its religious function, which continues to this day. After expropriation, the monastery area was first used as the home of the Primer Cuerpo de Caballería del Estado (First Cavalry Corps of the State). Over time the church fell into disrepair but was restored in the 1940s. The rest of the complex was restored and converted to its present function starting in 1977.<ref name="casacul">{{cite web |url=http://cultura.michoacan.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=358&Itemid=285 |title= Casa de la Cultura de |publisher= Secretaria de la Cultura-Michoacán |location=Morelia |language=es |trans-title=House of Culture - Michoacan |access-date=2009-11-21 }}</ref>

The Orquidario of Morelia is an [[orchid]] museum which houses approximately 3,400 species of the flower. The botanical garden consists of three greenhouses with some outside space. The museum is managed by [[SEMARNAT]] as part of a program to preserve wild species. The botanical garden has a surface area of over {{Convert|990|m2|ft2|sp=us}} and was founded in 1980.<ref name="redescolar">{{cite web|url=http://www.redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/publicaciones/publi_prodigios/orquidario/orquidario.htm |title=Orquidario de Morelia Michoacán. |publisher=[[Instituto Latinoamericano de la Comunicación Educativa]] |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=Orchid museum of Morelia, Michoacan |access-date=2009-11-21 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910052134/http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/publicaciones/publi_prodigios/orquidario/orquidario.htm |archive-date=September 10, 2010 }}</ref>

The Museo Regional Michoacano (Regional Museum of Michoacán) was founded in 1886 and its design was heavily influenced by French ideas of museum design of the time. It is housed in a building that belonged to Emperor Maximilian I, and is of ornate Baroque design. Most of the exhibits are about the history of the region with rooms dedicated to pre-Hispanic artifacts and colonial art. One noted piece is the painting called “Traslado de las Monjas” which is considered to be the finest work produced in Michoacán during the colonial period. Other important works include the original volume of the Voyage de Humboldt et Bonpland, edited in Paris in 1807 and the murals done by Alfredo Zalce, [[Federico Cantú]] and [[Grace Greenwood Ames|Grace Greenwood]]. There are also interactive exhibits on the origins of the earth and life. The museum also has conference rooms, a library, and a reading room.<ref name="enjoymuseums">{{cite web |url=http://www.enjoymexico.net/mexico/morelia-museos-mexico.php |title=Museo en Morelia México |publisher=Enjoy Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Museums in Morelia, Mexico |access-date=2009-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612012237/http://www.enjoymexico.net/mexico/morelia-museos-mexico.php |archive-date=2010-06-12 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

The Museo del Estado (The State Museum) is dedicated to the state's past and present. It was opened in 1986 and divided into three sections – archeology, history and ethnology of the state. There is also an exhibit of the old Mier Pharmacy with its equipment from 1868. The museum is a mansion dating from the 18th century.<ref name="enjoymuseums"/>

The Museo de Arte Colonial (Museum of Colonial Art) holds a collection of documents, old books, religious ornaments and maps from the colonial period. The museum's main attraction is its collection of more than 100 figures of Christ done in cornstalk paste. These figures were created by indigenous artists, starting under the direction of Vasco de Quiroga, between the 16th and 19th centuries. There are also paintings done by [[Miguel Cabrera]] and [[José Padilla (painter)|José Padilla]] from the 18th century. The museum is in an old Baroque residence from the 18th century. Prior to the building's use as a museum, it was the site of the first official government press in the state, founded in 1821.<ref name="enjoymuseums"/>

The Casa Museum [[José María Morelos]] y Pavón ([[José María Morelos]] y Pavón House Museum) contains a collection of items from the colonial and early independence periods of Mexico's history, including articles that belonged to Morelos himself. Morelos bought the house in 1802, but did not live there much, especially in the years just before and during the Mexican War of Independence because of his involvement with the movement. In 1933, the house was declared a national monument and in 1939 became the property of [[INAH]] to be converted into this museum. Later, the building underwent another round of restoration work and was re-inaugurated in 1991. The lower level is mostly dedicated to Morelos with the rooms on the upper level dedicated to the war in general. The museum is also the archive of the Bishopric of Michoacán and contains documents from the 16th to the 20th centuries.<ref name="enjoymuseums"/>

[[File:Museo de Sitio y Archivo Histórico Casa de Morelos Morelia 4.jpg|thumb|left|Morelos' birthplace]]
The Casa Natal de Morelos (Morelos’ Birthplace) is the house where José María Morelos y Pavón was born in 1765. The building is a large mansion with a Neoclassic facade and a Baroque interior. In 1888, the original building was destroyed to build a farmhouse. This is the building that has been restored and turned into a museum in 1964, for the coming bicentennial of Morelos’ birth. The museum contains documents and belongings of Morelos including ones he signed, money he had coined, paintings and a large library.<ref name="enjoymuseums"/>

The Museo de la Máscara (Mask Museum) presents two different mask collections, totaling more than 165 examples from cultures in twenty Mexican states. It is located in the Casa de Artesanias de Morelia (Handcraft House of Morelia).<ref name="enjoymuseums"/>

The Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Alfredo Zalce (Alfredo Zalce Museum of Contemporary Art) mostly contains works done by Alfredo Zalce and [[Efraín Vargas]], both renowned Michoacán painters. It also holds temporary exhibits by Mexican and international artists.<ref name="enjoymuseums"/>

The [[Plaza Monumental de Morelia]] was established in 1951, which was destined exclusively for [[bullfights]]. Nowadays, the ring also hosts concerts, [[lucha libre]], and weddings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Michoacán |first1=Secretaría de Turismo de |title=Bullring Monumental de Morelia · Places |url=http://michoacan.travel/en/places/bullring-monumental-de-morelia.html |website=michoacan.travel |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en |archive-date=4 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804073221/http://michoacan.travel/en/places/bullring-monumental-de-morelia.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The {{ill|Morelia Aqueduct|lt=city's aqueduct|es|Acueducto de Morelia}} was first documented in 1549. It was used to transport fresh water to the required destination so that the inhabitants of the city could access it. The water system was made of used wood from canoes in the area to create the base structure during its construction. As years passed with the use of the aqueduct constantly changing, there was an incident that occurred in 1784. The incident was that part of the Morelia aqueduct foundation collapsed, leaving hundreds without access to the water. On October 21, 1785, a document detailed the reconstruction of the aqueduct, and a man named Fray Antonio de San Miguel volunteered to make a plan for the reconstruction of the structure. With Fray Antonio's plans, they completely reconstructed the arches and added fixtures to repair the previous damage. As the repairs were completed the aqueduct remained in use until it stopped functioning in 1910; it remains standing to this day. The whole Aqueduct structure consisted of 253 arches (some of which have collapsed over the years), at a height of {{Convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}}.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.espejel.com/el-acueducto-de-valladolid-morelia/ |title = El Acueducto de Valladolid-Morelia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/0956247806063969|title = Water, society and environment in the history of one Mexican city|journal = Environment and Urbanization|volume = 18|pages = 129–140|year = 2006|last1 = Garcia|first1 = Patricia Avila| issue=1 | bibcode=2006EnUrb..18..129G |s2cid = 144105112}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cambiodemichoacan.com.mx/nota-n3153 |title = El Acueducto monumento civil más importante de Morelia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.moreliainvita.com/acueducto-de-morelia/ |title = Acueducto de Morelia – Morelia Invita}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/108915 |doi = 10.4995/loggia.2000.5199|title = El monumento como documento para su historia Restauración del Acueducto de Morelia en México|journal = Loggia, Arquitectura & Restauración|issue = 10|pages = 72–79|year = 2000|last1 = Cabrera Acevea|first1 = Juan|last2 = Ettinger|first2 = Catherine R.|doi-access = free|hdl = 10251/108915|hdl-access = free}}</ref>

[[File:Ganadores.jpg|thumb|Winners speech at the 2010 Morelia Film Fest]]

The '''[[Morelia International Film Festival|Festival Internacional de Cine de Morelia]]''' was begun in 2003, and is mostly dedicated to [[Mexican cinema]], showcasing up-and-coming directors and productions. The majority of activities take place in the Cinépolis Morelia Centro, but also includes other theaters, auditoriums and public plazas.

Morelia is the site of the annual '''Zapata Vive Morelia Festival''', which celebrates the life of Emiliano Zapata with cultural and political activities. The purpose of the event is to promote exhibitions by artistic, cultural and social organizations from the state of Michoacán and other parts of the country. Events are spread out over several days and include ones such as concerts, round tables and information sessions. The event encourages those organizations who work with the lower social classes and are politically left to participate.<ref name="zapatavive">{{cite web |url=http://mexico.indymedia.org/?article561 |title=Festival Zapata Vive Morelia |date=2009-04-14 |language=es |access-date=2009-11-21 }}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Interior del Colegio Primitivo y Nacional de San Nicolas de Hidalgo.JPG|thumb|Colegio de San Nicolas]]

During the colonial period the city had four major educational institutions, the Colegio Seminario Tridentino, the Colegio de San Nicolás, the Colegio de los Jesuitas and the Colegio de las Rosas.<ref name="mexdesmor"/>
The state university, the '''[[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo]]''', is the oldest university in the Americas, which has its origins in the college founded in 1540 by Vasco de Quiroga in Pátzcuaro, the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo. This school was founded to train priests and missionaries for work in Michoacán. The school gained a royal seal and patronage in 1543. In 1566, colonial religious authorities took over the school and in 1574, academics here were under the jurisdiction of the [[Jesuits]]. With the episcopal seat changed to Valladolid, the school moved also in 1580 and was fused with the already existing Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. The school was reformed in the 17th century and its curriculum was redesigned in the 18th to include courses in philosophy, religious law, civil law and other subjects. At the beginning the 19th century, the school became one of New Spain's main centers of learning and academia, producing scholars such as a Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, José Ma. Morelos, [[José Sixto Verduzco]], [[José María Izazaga]] and [[Ignacio López Rayón]], most of whom would have a role in the upcoming Mexican War of Independence. The school closed during the war but was reopened in 1847 with the name Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, focusing more on secular studies such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, etc. based on the European university model.

[[File:Estadio Morelos.jpg|thumb|[[Morelos Stadium]]]]

Morelia was represented by their soccer team, [[Monarcas Morelia]], in the [[Liga MX]].
Monarcas Morelia was founded in 1950 on a field outside the city where a monument to Lázaro Cárdenas is now located. The team's original name was Club Deportivo Morelia and was owned by Eucuario Gómez. The club's colors are the city's flag colors red and yellow because Morelia is known to be the most Spanish city in Mexico. 
The club was nicknamed “Amarillo”(Yellow) During the 1956–57 season, when the club won the right to play in the 1st division in which they played in their first tournament for the [[Copa México]] against [[Club América]].
 
The club descended into the 2nd division again in 1968 and experienced tough times during the early 70s. By the end of the 1973–74 season the team was completely restructured by 32 Morelia Businessmen who acquired the team. After 13 years in the 2nd division, the team finally returned to 1st division play in 1981 and by the mid-1980s was competitive and reaching the Liguilla (playoffs) regularly.

Following many years of playing at Estadio Venustiano Carranza, the completion of [[Estadio Morelos]] in 1989 gave the team a new home. In 1996, the team was acquired by [[TV Azteca]] and the name Monarcas ([[Monarchs]]) Morelia was adopted in 1999 because of the three Spanish Monarchs shown in the flag of Morelia. The team won its first championship during the Invierno 2000 season and by mid-decade, was playing in international competition such as the [[Copa Libertadores]] and the Liga de Campeones de la CONCACAF ([[CONCACAF Champions League]]). The team's latest success came during the [[2010 North American SuperLiga]] tournament, which Monarcas won over the [[New England Revolution]] on September the 1st, 2010, at New England.

The team closed the Apertura 2010 tournament of the [[Primera División de México]] (Mexico's 1st division), failing to make the "liguilla".<ref name="monarcas">{{cite web |url=http://www.fuerzamonarca.com |title=Fuerza Monarca |publisher=Club Fútbol Morelia |location=Morelia, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Monarch Force}}</ref>

In 2020 it was announced that the franchise would be moving to the city of [[Mazatlán]], [[Sinaloa]], and would be Renamed [[Mazatlán F.C.]] Soon after, the municipal government announced that they would have a new team playing in the [[Liga de Expansión MX]] (Mexico's second division) under the name [[Atlético Morelia]]

==Transportation==
[[File:Morelia International Airport DSC 0585 AD.JPG|thumb|Airport of Morelia]]
Morelia is three or four hours from Mexico City via the [[Atlacomulco]]-[[Santiago Maravatío|Maravatío]]-Morelia highway and is connected by highways to the states of [[Mexico State|Mexico]], [[Querétaro]], Guanajuato and [[Jalisco]]. It is connected to the Michoacán coast via highway 200 that passes through Uruapan to the port of [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]]. [[General Francisco Mujica International Airport]] or Morelia International Airport (IATA: MLM, ICAO: MMMM) is an international airport at Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico. The airport handles both domestic and international flights, with connections to Mexico City, Uruapan, Lázaro Cárdenas, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana and several destinations in the United States. The airport is named after a former governor of the state of Michoacán.<ref name="raices"/>

==The municipality==

As the municipal seat, Morelia is the governing authority of 423 other communities, almost all of which are small communities of between three and 1,000 people, with 89% of the municipality's population of 684,145 people within the city itself.<ref name="INEGI">{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=es |access-date=2009-11-23 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328224939/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archive-date=2007-03-28 }}</ref> The municipality covers a territory of {{convert|1199.02|km2}} and borders the municipalities of [[Tarímbaro]], [[Chucándiro]], [[Huaniqueo]], Charo, [[Tzitzio]], [[Villa Madero]], [[Acuitzío del Canje|Acuitzio]], [[Lagunillas Municipality, Michoacán|Lagunillas]], [[Coeneo de la Libertad|Coeneo]], [[Tzintzuntzán, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]] and [[Quiroga, Michoacán|Quiroga]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

Much of the municipality is in the Guayangareo Valley between two rivers: the El Grande and the El Chiquito. Guayangareo means "large hill with a flat side."<ref name="ahistoria"/> The municipality's territory is rugged and dominated by peaks such as Punhuato, El Zapote and the Otzumatlán mountain range, with the highest peak being [[Cerro del Quinceo|Quinceo]] with an elevation of {{convert|2787|m}}. The municipality belongs to the [[Lerma River|Lerma]]-Santiago river hydraulic region, with the main rivers being the El Grande and the El Chiquito. There are a number of streams including the Zarza and Pitaya. The most important dam here is Cointzio, with other smaller ones being Umécuaro, Laja Caliente and La Mintzita.

Vegetation outside the city varies based on elevation and the type of soil. Mountainous areas are mostly covered in [[conifer]]s while lower and drier areas have trees such as [[mesquite]]. To the south of the city is the Lázaro Cárdenas Forest, which is an ecological reserve. Animal life mostly consists of small mammals, with coyotes being the largest, birds of prey and some reptiles.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The growth of the city of Morelia is having a negative impact on the surrounding forested area. This is particularly problematic in the area north of the city, which belongs to the [[Lake Cuitzeo]] basin, and is a main recharge area for the city's [[aquifer]]. The forested areas around the city are also important for the city's air quality and as a breeding place for pollinating insects needed for agriculture. [[UNAM]] has been documenting the species in these forests with the aim of getting them declared as biological reserves.<ref name="reyes">{{cite news |title= En riesgo, zona boscosa de Morelia |first=Gema |last=Reyes |url=http://www.lajornadamichoacan.com.mx/2009/10/29/index.php?section=politica&article=005n2po |newspaper= La Jornada Michoacán |location= Morelia, Mexico |date=2009-10-29 |access-date=2009-11-21 |language=es |trans-title=At risk, the forested zone of Morelia }}</ref>

One industrial area is the Ciudad Industrial de Morelia, which mostly houses small and medium-sized enterprises. Some of the products manufactured here include cooking oil, flour, cement, plastics, bottling and candies.<ref name="encmuc" /> Tourism is a rising component of the economy, taking advantage of area's colonial heritage, smaller traditional communities, natural areas and archeological zones such as Santa María de Guido in the city, Barranca de los Lobos in Teremendo, Nahuatl Sanctuary and Catrina in Capula. However, it has not been developed sufficiently to be a major contributor.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="poors">{{cite web |url=http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/es/la/page.article/2,1,1,0,1204851792136.html |title= Standard & Poor's confirma calificación de 'mxA+' del municipio de Morelia, Michoacán; la perspectiva es estable |date=2009-11-12 |language=es |trans-title=Standard & Poor’s confirms grade of ‘mxA+’ of the municipality of Morelia, Michoacán; forecast is stable |access-date=2009-11-21 }}</ref> Tourism accounts for the main economic activity in Morelia. Unfortunately, due to Mexico's rising crime in drug trafficking within the cartels, this can provide a grave disincentive in the tourism sector for Morelia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/mexico-travel-warning.html|title=Mexico Travel Warning|website=travel.state.gov|access-date=2016-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601001513/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/mexico-travel-warning.html|archive-date=2016-06-01|url-status = dead}}</ref>

According to [[Standard & Poor's]] report for November 2009, the government of Morelia maintains an adequate development budget, backed by relatively high income and low debt. It is rated on a national scale for Mexico as A+. The economy is projected to be stable with the government keeping control of expenses.<ref name="poors" />
