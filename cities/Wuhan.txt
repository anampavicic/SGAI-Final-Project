Wuhan lies in the eastern [[Jianghan Plain]], at the confluence of the [[Yangtze]] river and its largest tributary, the [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]], and is known as "Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare" ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|九省通衢}}}}).<ref name="Readmeok Sina"/> Wuhan was the site of the 1911 [[Wuchang Uprising]] against the [[Qing dynasty]] which [[Dynasties of China|ended 2,000 years of dynastic rule]].

==Etymology==
The name "Wuhan" comes from the two major cities on the banks of the [[Yangtze River]] that make up the Wuhan metropolis: "Wu" refers to the city of [[Wuchang]] ({{zh|c=武昌}}), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while "Han" refers to the city of [[Hankou]] ({{zh|s=汉口}}), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze. "Hankou" means "Mouth of the Han", from its position at the confluence of the Han with the Yangtze River.

In 1926, the [[Northern Expedition]] reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927,<ref name="history1">{{cite web|script-title=zh:武汉市历史沿革|url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/hb/15225.html|date=August 6, 2014|access-date=April 6, 2018|quote={{lang|zh-hans|1927 年1月1日，中央临时联席会议宣布，国民政府在汉口开始办公。国民政府命令将武昌、汉口、汉阳三镇合为京兆区，定名"武汉"，作为临时首都。4月16日，武汉市政委员会成立，武昌市政厅撤销；三镇首次统 – 行政建制。}}|language=zh-hans|publisher=XZQH.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211161122/http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/hb/15225.html|archive-date=December 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> the resulting city was proclaimed as '{{zh|t={{linktext|武漢}}|labels=no}}' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] as '{{lang|zh-hans|武汉}}' (also 'Wuhan').<ref name="历史沿革">{{cite web| url=http://jianghan.gov.cn/zoujinjianghan/lsyg/201202/t20120214_41133.html|script-title=zh:历史沿革| access-date=March 21, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625224752/http://www.jianghan.gov.cn/zoujinjianghan/lsyg/201202/t20120214_41133.html| archive-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref><ref name="江汉综述">{{cite web | url=http://www.whfz.gov.cn:8080/pub/dqwx/qnj/jhnj07/content.htm | script-title=zh:江汉综述 | access-date=March 21, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202181053/http://www.whfz.gov.cn:8080/pub/dqwx/qnj/jhnj07/content.htm | archive-date=February 2, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="武汉的由来">{{cite web | url=http://www.whdaj.gov.cn/jcfm/zg-01.htm | script-title=zh:"武汉"的由来 | access-date=March 31, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425210116/http://www.whdaj.gov.cn/jcfm/zg-01.htm | archive-date=April 25, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Wuhan}}
<!--Eventually, the [[Timeline of Wuhan]] should be created and linked here with {{For timeline|Timeline of Wuhan}} -->

===Antiquity era ===
[[File:Erligang map.svg|thumb|left|[[Panlongcheng]], located in the southernmost area of the [[Erligang culture]]]]

The Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years. [[Panlongcheng]], an archaeological site primarily associated with the [[Erligang culture]] ({{circa|1510|1460}}&nbsp;BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou period]]), is located in modern-day [[Huangpi District]] of Wuhan.

During the [[Western Zhou]] the [[E (state)|State of E]], which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] for the rest of the Western Zhou and [[Eastern Zhou]] periods. After the [[State of Huang]] was conquered by State of Chu in the summer of 648 BC,<ref>《左传·僖公十二年》："黄人恃诸侯之睦于齐也，不共楚职，曰："自郢及我九百里，焉能害我？" 夏，楚灭黄。"</ref> the people of Huang were moved into the area in and around present-day Wuhan. Local geographical terms including the name of Wuhan's Huangpi District were named after the State of Huang.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Chu was in turn conquered by [[Qin (state)|Qin]] in 223&nbsp;BC.

===Imperial China===
[[File:武汉黄鹤楼.jpg|thumb|[[Yellow Crane Tower]]]]
During the [[Han dynasty]], Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The [[Battle of Xiakou]] in AD&nbsp;203 and [[Battle of Jiangxia]] five years later were fought in the region over control of [[Jiangxia Commandery]], territories of which included much of present-day eastern Hubei. In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in [[Chinese history]] and a central event in the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''—the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]—took place near the [[Yangtze River]], with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations.<ref name=":1">"The engagement at the Red Cliffs took place in the winter of the 13th year of Jian'an, probably about the end of 208."{{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=264}}</ref> Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the [[Yellow Crane Tower]], one of the [[Four Great Towers of China]], was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of [[Sun Quan]], leader of the [[Eastern Wu]]. The tower became a sacred site of [[Taoism]].<ref>Images of the Immortal: The Cult of [[Lü Dongbin]] at the Palace of Eternal Joy by Paul R. Katz, University of Hawaii Press, 1999, p. 80</ref>

Due to tensions between the [[Eastern Wu]] and [[Cao Wei]] kingdoms, in the autumn of 228,{{efn|name=fn1|Man Chong's biography in the ''Sanguozhi'' mentioned that these events took place in the 3rd year of the Taihe era (227–233) of Cao Rui's reign, i.e., the year 229. This is a mistake. It was actually in the 2nd year of the Taihe era, i.e., the year 228, according to the ''Zizhi Tongjian''.<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 71.</ref>}} [[Cao Rui]], grandson of [[Cao Cao]] and the second emperor of the state of [[Cao Wei]], ordered the general [[Man Chong]] to lead troops to Xiakou ({{lang|zh-hant|夏口}}; in present-day Wuhan).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/06dat/geo.html#wuhan |title=Hanyang was founded during the Sui dynasty (581–618); and Hankou, then known as Hsia-k'ou, during the Song (Sung) dynasty (960–1279)| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408204923/http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/06dat/geo.html#wuhan |archive-date=April 8, 2018 }}</ref><ref>({{lang|zh-Hant|秋，使曹休從廬江南入合肥，令寵向夏口。}}) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 26.</ref> In 279, [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]] and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as [[Xiling District|Xiling]] (in present-day [[Yichang]], Hubei), Xiakou ({{lang|zh-hant|夏口}}; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang ({{lang|zh|武昌}}; present-day [[Ezhou]], Hubei).

During the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states [[Liu Song]] (420–479), [[Southern Qi]] (479–502), [[Liang dynasty|Liang]],{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} and [[Western Liang (555–587)|Western Liang]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

In fall 550, [[Hou Jing]] sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si ({{lang|zh-hant|蕭嗣}}). Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control. Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia ({{lang|zh-hant|江夏}}, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire—believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne—and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned [[Wu Mingche]] as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang ({{lang|zh|淳于量}}). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou ({{lang|zh|沌口}}, in modern Wuhan).

The city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. [[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]], a celebrated poet of the [[Tang dynasty]], visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.<ref name="Wan1">Wan: p. 42.</ref>

In spring 877, [[Wang Xianzhi (rebel)|Wang Xianzhi]] captured E Prefecture ({{lang|zh-hant|鄂州}}, in modern Wuhan). He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture ({{lang|zh-hant|宋州}}, in modern [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]). In winter 877, [[Huang Chao]] pillaged Qi and Huang ({{lang|zh-hant|黃州}}, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.

Before [[Kublai Khan]] arrived in 1259, word reached him that [[Möngke]] had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the [[Yangtze]]. The present-day [[Wuying Pagoda]] was constructed at the end of the [[Song dynasty]] between attacks by the Mongolian forces. Under the [[Mongol]] rulers ([[Yuan dynasty]]) (after 1301), the Wuchang [[prefecture]], headquartered in the town, became the capital of [[Hubei]] province. Hankou, from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] to late [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], was under the administration of the local government in [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], although it was already one of the four major national markets ({{zh|labels=no|s=[[:zh:四大名镇]]}}) of the Ming dynasty.

Hanyang's [[Guiyuan Temple]] was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guiyuanchansi.com.cn/list.php?fid=82 |script-title=zh:归元描述 – 归元禅寺 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203235744/http://www.guiyuanchansi.com.cn/list.php?fid=82 |archive-date=February 3, 2018 |quote={{lang|zh-Hans|归元禅寺位于武汉市汉阳区，东眺晴川阁、南滨鹦鹉洲、北邻古琴台，占地153亩，是湖北省重点文物保护单位。由浙江僧人白光、主峰于清顺治十五年（1658 年）依王氏葵园而创建。}}}}</ref>

By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four [[trading]] centers. In the late 19th century, [[railroads]] were extended on a north–south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important [[transshipment]] point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a [[concession (territory)|concession]] in Hankou.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=USFD_d-d7FhgC&dq=french+Guangzhouwan&pg=PA83 ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'', Google Print, p. 83]{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Robert Aldrich, Palgrave Macmillan, 1996, {{ISBN|0-312-16000-3}}</ref> During the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, [[Wuying Pagoda|Xingfu Temple]], [[Zhuodaoquan Temple]] and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856–1860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the [[Yangtze River]] in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.

In the spring of 1861, Counselor [[Harry Smith Parkes]] and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the [[Convention of Peking]], Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of {{convert|30.53|km2|sp=us}} along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to set up its consulate in the concession.

In 1862, Russian tea merchants arrived in the treaty port of Hankou. Russians in Hankou established four factories using assembly lines and machinery to produce brick tea, and became the city's richest industrialists in what would become the Russian concession.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=The British Concession and the First Years of the Treaty Port · Hankou to Wuhan: Histories from China's Crossroads · Hankou to Wuhan |url=https://hankoutowuhan.org/s/hankou/page/the-british-concession-and-the-opening-of-hankou |access-date=2023-04-03 |website=hankoutowuhan.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lee |first=Chinyun |date=2014 |title=From Kiachta to Vladivostok: Russian Merchants and the Tea Trade |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43737542 |journal=Region |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=195–218 |jstor=43737542 |issn=2166-4307}}</ref> Japanese immigrants, mainly traders, also started arriving in 1874.<ref name=":3" />

In 1889, [[Zhang Zhidong]] was transferred from [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces) to [[Viceroy of Huguang]] ([[Hunan]] and [[Hubei]] provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of "Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application," known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a ''zhen'' and a ''xie'' (both ''zhen'' and ''xie'' are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.

Originally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] was founded in 1891, who diverted funds from the [[Nanyang Fleet]] in [[Guangdong]] to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V682XHpDLXoC&q=new+chinese+rifle+factory+han+yang&pg=PA414|title=The Chinese Recorder|author=Kathleen L Lodwick|year=2009|publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|page=414|isbn=978-1-115-48856-3|access-date=June 28, 2010}}</ref> On April 23, 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some {{Convert|40|acre|m2}}, could start production of small-caliber cannons.

With the northern extension of the [[Northern Expedition]], the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the [[Kuomintang]] Central Political Committee decided to [[Historical capitals of China|move the capital]] from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, [[Hankou]], and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called "Capital District". The new national government, later known as "[[Wuhan nationalist government]]", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.<ref name="Remaking the Chinese City" /> 

In March 1927, [[Mao Zedong]] appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing [[Wang Jingwei]] leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the [[Nanjing]] faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|page=68}} Members of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected [[Chen Duxiu]] (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General.<ref>Robert Jackson Alexander, ''International Trotskyism, 1929–1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement'' (Duke University Press, 1991) p. 206</ref> The split was partially motivated by the [[Shanghai Massacre|purge of the Communists]] within the party, which marked the end of the [[First United Front]], and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|page=72}}

In June 1927, [[Stalin]] sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants.<ref>Harrison, ''The Long March to Power'', p. 111</ref> This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The [[Wuhan coup]] was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his [[Shanghai]]-based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927.<ref name="Clark">Clark, Anne Biller. Clark, Anne Bolling. Klein, Donald.

In the [[1931 China floods]], one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and following the [[Battle of Nanking|fall of Nanking]] in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern [[monoplane]] bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]], which included support from the [[Soviet Volunteer Group]] in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the [[Battle of Wuhan]]. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.

In early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT [[gunboat]] ''[[Chinese gunboat Chung Shan|Zhongshan]]'' came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the ''Zhongshan'' sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the ''Zhongshan'' has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban [[Jiangxia District]], which opened on September 26, 2011.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by [[Bai Chongxi]].<ref>{{harvnb|皮明庥，郑自来|2011|pp=108–109}}</ref>

This was rejected, and on May 15, 1949, Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city.

The [[Changjiang Water Resources Commission]] was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.

Before construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.
[[File:Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in construction.jpg|thumb|'''Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge In Construction''']]
The project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing–Hankou railway]] with the [[Guangzhou–Hankou railway|Guangdong–Hankou railway]] into the [[Beijing–Guangzhou railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|九省通衢}}}}) in name and in fact. 

After Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|title=Li Rui wen ji. |author=Li, Rui |date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|isbn=978-9889958114|location=Xianggang|oclc=688480117}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Overview===
[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nh50-5.jpg|left|thumb|Map including the Wuhan area ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1953)]]
Wuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29° 58'–31° 22' N and longitude 113° 41'–115° 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] flowing into the [[Yangtze River]] at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.

The metropolitan area comprises three parts—[[Wuchang, Hubei|Wuchang]], [[Hankou District|Hankou]], and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]]—commonly called the "Three Towns of Wuhan" (hence the name "Wuhan", combining "Wu" from the first city and "Han" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the "First Bridge".
* Wuchang lies south east of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.
* Hankou sits north of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is north of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.
* Hanyang lies west of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.

[[File:Mount Mo and East Lake, Wuhan.jpg|thumb|[[East Lake (Wuhan)|East Lake]]]]
It is simple in terrain—low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The [[She River]] enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of {{convert|8494.41|km2|sp=us}}, most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among major cities in China.<ref name=nl/> Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the [[East Lake (Wuhan)|East Lake]] of 33 km2, and [[Tangxun Lake]], which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.<ref name=nl/>

Other well-known lakes include [[South Lake (Wuhan)|South Lake]] and [[Sand Lake (Wuhan)|Sand Lake]]. [[Liangzi Lake]], the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of [[Jiangxia District]].The twin peaks at the junction of Huangpi District and Xiaogan City, with an altitude of 872.5 meters, are the highest points in Wuhan. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including [[Mount Luojia]] ({{lang|zh|珞珈山}}) in Wuchang District as well as [[Mount Hong]] ({{lang|zh|洪山}}) and [[Mount Yujia]] ({{lang|zh|喻家山/瑜珈山}}) in [[Hongshan District, Wuhan|Hongshan District]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wh.bendibao.com/tour/2013423/36646_3.shtm |title=武汉爬山好去处：华中科技大学喻家山- 武汉本地宝 |access-date=March 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184411/http://wh.bendibao.com/tour/2013423/36646_3.shtm |archive-date=November 8, 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.

The (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the [[Jinghan railway]] from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the [[Yuehan railway]] to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the [[Jingguang railway]], both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.

As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the [[Hankou railway station]].

In 2006, construction began on the new [[Wuhan railway station]] with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its [[Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway|second high-speed train]] with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of {{convert|394|km/h|2|abbr=on}}. The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.<ref>[Source: Beijing (AFP), Sat December 26, 7:54 am ET]</ref>

{{As of|2011}}, the new [[Wuhan railway station]] is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.

Construction work is carried out on several lines of the new [[Wuhan Metropolitan Area intercity railway]], which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of [[Xianning]], [[Huangshi]], [[Huanggang]], and [[Xiaogan]]. The first line of the system, [[Wuhan–Xianning Intercity Railway|the one to Xianning]], opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to [[Wuhan–Xiaogan intercity railway|Xiaogen]] opened on December 1, 2016, and it was extended with the opening of the [[Wuhan–Shiyan high-speed railway]] to Shiyan on November 29, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hb.chinanews.com/news/2016/1201/266267.html |script-title=zh:武孝城际铁路正式开通 市民可以坐城铁赶飞机 |trans-title=Wuhan–Xiaogan intercity railway officially opens; city residents can take the line to catch flights |language=zh |website=chinanews.com Hubei |date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=December 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109191244/http://www.hb.chinanews.com/news/2016/1201/266267.html |archive-date=November 9, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Wuhan – Shiyan high speed line opens |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/high-speed/wuhan-shiyan-high-speed-line-opens/55242.article |website=Railway Gazette International |access-date=December 1, 2019 |date=November 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219204110/https://www.railwaygazette.com/high-speed/wuhan-shiyan-high-speed-line-opens/55242.article |archive-date=December 19, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The headquarters of [[Hubei Television]] is located in Wuchang District. [[Tortoise Mountain TV Tower]] is China's first self-developed TV tower, opened in 1986. The modern newspapers in Wuhan can be dated back to 1866, when ''Hankow Times'', a newspaper in English, was founded. Before 1949, more than 50 newspapers and magazines were published by foreigners in Wuhan. ''Chao-wen Hsin-pao'', founded by Ai Xiaomei in 1873, was the first Chinese newspaper to appear in Hankou (one of the cities that was merged into Wuhan). During the [[Northern Expedition]] era (1926–1928), journalism in Wuhan came to a climax; more than 120 newspapers and periodicals, including national newspapers such as ''[[Central Daily News]]'' and ''[[Republican Daily News]]'', were founded or published during this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whfz.gov.cn:8080/pub/dqwx/dylsz/xwz/|script-title=zh:武汉市志(1840-1985)·新闻志·概述|trans-title=Wuhan City Annals 1840-1985·News Media Annals·Introduction|publisher=武汉市地情文献|access-date=August 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903064803/http://www.whfz.gov.cn:8080/pub/dqwx/dylsz/xwz/|archive-date=September 3, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Chutian Metropolis Daily'' and ''Wuhan Evening News'' are two major local commercial tabloid newspapers.

== Culture ==
The plum blossom is the city's emblem, chosen partly because of the long history of local plum cultivation and use, and partly to recognize the plum's current economic significance in terms of cultivation and research. Local wild plums were used medicinally during the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han dynasty|Han]] dynasties. Cultivation of the fruit began during the [[Song dynasty]]. Some traditional new year customs revolve around the planting of plums.

===Language===
{{Main|Wuhan dialect}}
Wuhan natives speak a variety of [[Southwestern Mandarin]] Chinese referred to as Wuhan dialect that differs slightly between the districts of Wuhan, including Wuchang dialect in Wuchang District, Hankou dialect in the Hankou districts, Hanyang dialect in Hanyang District, and Qingshan dialect in Qingshan District.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Hot Dry Noodles.jpg|thumb|Hot Dry Noodles]]
{{main|Hubei cuisine}}
Hubei cuisine is one of [[Chinese regional cuisine|China's ten major styles of cooking]]. With a history of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in ancient Chu cuisine, has developed a number of distinctive dishes, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, and others. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat {{transliteration|zh|dìcài zhǔ jīdàn}} ({{lang|zh-hans|地菜煮鸡蛋}}), an egg dish which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xw.qq.com/hb/20180419008684/HBC2018041900868400 |title=三月三吃地菜煮鸡蛋能治头痛？专家：可防流感 |access-date=April 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419121259/https://xw.qq.com/hb/20180419008684/HBC2018041900868400 |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

"No need to be particular about the recipes; all foods have their own uses. [[Rice wine]] and [[tangyuan (food)|tangyuan]] are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies."<ref>Hankou Zhuzhici (an ancient book recording stories about Wuhan) produced during the Daoguang Period of the [[Qing dynasty]]</ref> This attitude expressed in ''Hankou Zhuzhici'' reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern and Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk,{{Clarify|reason=Whatever term this is meant to translate, it's not doing it in understandable English.|date=December 2018}} tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.

''Guozao'' ({{linktext|lang=zh-hant|過早}}) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan, and a part of the city's culture. As a hub for land transport in China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a concentration of diverse cuisines from different places. The most famous place to ''guozao'' (have breakfast) is Hubu Street ({{lang|zh-hans|戶部巷}}), a 150-meter-long street in the neighborhood of Simenkou ({{lang|zh-hans|司门口}}). Along its short length one can find nearly all the traditional foods of Wuhan, such as:

[[File:Mianwo.JPG|thumb|[[Mianwo]], a donut-shaped snack from Wuhan]]
* [[Re gan mian|Hot and dry noodles]], ''re-gan mian'' ({{linktext|lang=zh-hans|热干面}}), consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.
* [[Wuhan duck|Duck's neck]] or ''Ya Bozi'' ({{lang|zh-hans|鸭脖子}}) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.
* Bean skin or ''[[doupi]]'' ({{lang|zh|豆皮}}) is a local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.
* [[Xiaolongbao#Related varieties|Soup dumpling]] or ''xiaolongtangbao'' ({{lang|zh-hans|小笼汤包}}) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, hence the name: ''tang'' (soup) ''bao'' (bun) – every time one takes a bite from it the "soup" inside is liable to spill out.
* A salty doughnut or ''[[mianwo]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|麪窩}}) is a kind of savory donut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common donut and is a typical Wuhan local food.
* Shaomai wrapped in oil cake (油饼包烧麦): 1 oil cake is filled with 4 pieces of heavy oil siomai, and the heavy oil is required to put diced meat, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and black pepper in it.
* Paste Soup Noodles (糊汤粉): It is a snack variety that uses round rice noodles as the main ingredient, fish paste soup, small shrimp, and chopped green onion as accessories.

===Opera===
[[Han opera]], which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China.

===Sports===
[[File:Wuhan Sport Centre 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wuhan Sports Center]]]]

Wuhan had a professional football team, [[Wuhan F.C.|Wuhan]], that plays in the [[China League One]]. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the team's home stadium, with a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. For the 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top-tier league of Chinese football, [[Chinese Super League]], and relocated its home to [[Wuhan Sports Center Stadium]], a modern stadium with 54,357 seats located in the suburbs of the city. However, the team did not play well in the ensuing season and was demoted back to China League One as the 2013 season ended. For financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014. In January 2023, the team folded. Wuhan also has the [[Wuhan Three Towns F.C.|Wuhan Three Towns]] in the Chinese Super League, who won the title during the 2022 season for the first time upon promotion from China League One.

===Bridges===
[[File:Wuhan Erqi Yangtze River Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|Wuhan Erqi Yangtze River Bridge]]
Wuhan has [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|eleven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River]]. The [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also called the First Bridge, was built over the [[Yangtze]] in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to [[train ferry|barge]] railcars across. Including its approaches, it is {{convert|5,511|ft|m}} long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the [[Soviet Union]].

The [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Bridge]], a [[cable-stayed bridge]] built of [[prestressed concrete]], has a central span of {{convert|400|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}; it is {{convert|4,678|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length (including {{convert|1,877|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} of the main bridge) and {{convert|26.5|to|33.5|m|1|abbr=off|sp=us}} in width. Its main bridgeheads are {{convert|90|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle the daily passage of 50,000 motor vehicles. The bridge was completed in 1995.

The [[Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also called Baishazhou Bridge, was completed in September 2000. Located {{convert|8.6|km|1|abbr=off|sp=us}} southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about {{Currency|amount=170000000|code=USD}}), the bridge, which is {{convert|3,586|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and {{convert|26.5|m|1|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, greatly easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.

The [[Yangluo Bridge]] carries [[Wuhan Ring Road|Wuhan's Ring Road]] across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the [[Hongshan District, Wuhan|Hongshan District]] with the [[Xinzhou District, Wuhan|Xinzhou District]]). It was opened on December 26, 2007.

The [[Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge]] crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. It is named after Tianxing Island (''Tianxingzhou''), above which it crosses the river. Built at a cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009,<ref>[http://english.cnhubei.com/2009-12/28/cms846940article.shtml Tianxingzhou highway-railway Bridge in Wuhan opens to traffic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330063819/http://english.cnhubei.com/2009-12/28/cms846940article.shtml |date=March 30, 2010 }}. english.cnhubei.com December 28, 2009</ref> in time for the opening of the [[Wuhan railway station]].

=== Former Twinnings ===

The city of Arnhem has unilaterally ended its twinning with Wuhan on July 21, 2021, citing concerns about the [[persecution of Uyghurs in China]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Arnhem verbreekt stedenband met Chinese stad Wuhan|date=July 22, 2021|url=https://www.gld.nl/nieuws/7304250/arnhem-verbreekt-stedenband-met-chinese-stad-wuhan|publisher=Omroep Gelderland|language=nl|access-date=July 22, 2021|archive-date=September 29, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929124117/https://www.gld.nl/nieuws/7304250/arnhem-verbreekt-stedenband-met-chinese-stad-wuhan|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Nature and wildlife==
In [[Chinese mythology]], the [[Baiji]] ("Yangtze River dolphin") has many origin stories. In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin, and the general a porpoise.<ref name=turvy>{{cite book|first=Samuel|last=Turvy|title=Witness to Extinction: How we Failed to Save the Yangtze River Dolphin|chapter=The Goddess of the Yangtze|pages=[https://archive.org/details/witnesstoextinct0000turv/page/3 3–4]|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954947-4|id={{ASIN|0199549486|country=uk}}|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/witnesstoextinct0000turv/page/3}}</ref>
