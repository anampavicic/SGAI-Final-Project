==Demographics==
In his [[seyahatname]], [[Evliya Çelebi]] mentioned that the plain of Suruj was initially inhabited by Arabs and Turkomans in mid-medieval era, while upon his visit in the 17th century, he observed that the plain was mainly inhabited by Kurds from the Dinayi, Barazi, Kuhbinik, and Jum tribes and Turkomans.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Çelebi |first1=Evliya |title=Evliyâ Çelebi Seyahatnâmesi: III |pages=153–154 |url=https://archive.org/details/EvliyelebiSeyahatnmesiIII/page/n153/mode/2up |access-date=3 January 2023}}</ref>

Today, Suruç is inhabited mostly by ethnic [[Kurds]].

== Ecclesiastical history of Batnae ==
Batnae was important enough in the [[Roman province]] of [[Osroene]] to become a [[suffragan]] bishopric of its capital Edessa's Metropolitan, yet was to fade. The most famous Bishop of the city was [[Jacob of Serugh]], the great Syriac Christian [[hymn]]ographer born around 451 at [[Kurtam]] on the [[Euphrates]] and educated at [[Edessa]] becoming a priest at Hawra in the Serugh district, as a wandering pastor of several villages. At the age of 67 he was made bishop of Batnan, where he died around 521. Jacob avoided the theological controversies of his age, and is claimed with equal eagerness by [[Chalcedonian]] and [[non-Chalcedonian Christianity|non-Chalcedonian Christians]] as one of their own. He wrote several Hymns, 760 homilies and the Syriac translation of Evagrius.<ref>[http://www.voskrese.info/spl/Xjas-serugh.html St. Jacobus of Sarug, Bishop of Batnæ ].</ref>

Another Bishop was [[Abraham of Batnae]],<ref name="CCEL">{{cite book | title = NPNF2-08. Basil: Letters and Select Works | date = 1968 | publisher = CCEL | pages = | isbn = 978-1-61025-069-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx1LhznlIQgC&pg=PT24}}</ref> a contemporary of [[Basil of Caesarea]].

The bishopric would be nominally restored in two different [[titular bishop]]rics, for different Catholic rite-specific particular churches.
