In [[2020 United States census|2020]], it had a total population of 123,011, making it the [[List of cities in Missouri|fifth-most populous city in Missouri]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/independencecitymissouri/PST045219 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref>

Independence is known as the "Queen City of the Trails"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usacitiesonline.com/mocountyindependence.htm|title=Independence}}</ref> because it was a point of departure for the [[California Trail|California]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[Santa Fe Trail]]s. It is the hometown of U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]], with the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|Truman Presidential Library and Museum]], and the gravesites of Truman and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Bess Truman]]. The city is sacred to the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], as the home of [[Joseph Smith]]'s 1831 [[Temple Lot]], and the headquarters of several Mormon denominations.

==History==
Independence was originally inhabited by [[Siouan|Missouri]] and [[Osage Nation|Osage]] Native Americans, followed by the Spanish and a brief French tenure. It became part of the United States with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. [[Lewis and Clark]] recorded in their journals that they stopped in 1804 to pick plums, raspberries, and wild apples at a site that would later form part of the city. Independence was also a stopping point for the "[[Donner Party]]", an ill-fated group of 19th-century [[wagon train]] emigrants whose westward journey along the [[California Trail]] ended in disaster, spawning one of the most well known and taboo stories of pioneer-era America.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Donner party {{!}} History, Facts, & Survivors|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Donner-party|access-date=July 21, 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Named after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Independence was founded on March 29, 1827,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfAuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA177 | title=How Missouri Counties, Towns and Streams Were Named | publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri | author=Eaton, David Wolfe | year=1916 | pages=177}}</ref> and quickly became an important [[American Frontier|frontier town]]. Independence was the farthest point westward on the [[Missouri River]] where the [[steamboats]] or other cargo vessels could travel, due to the convergence of the [[Kansas River]] with the Missouri River approximately six miles west of town, near the current [[Kansas]]-Missouri border. Independence immediately became a jumping-off point for the emerging [[fur trade]], accommodating merchants and adventurers beginning the long trek westward on the Santa Fe Trail.

[[File:"lndependence-Courthouse-Missouri.", 1855 - NARA - 513335.jpg|thumb|Engraving of the Courthouse in Independence, 1855]]
In 1831, members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] began moving to the Jackson County, Missouri area. Shortly thereafter, founder [[Joseph Smith]] declared a [[Temple Lot|spot west of the Courthouse Square]] to be the place for his prophesied temple of the [[New Jerusalem]], in expectation of the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. Tension grew with local Missourians until the [[Latter Day Saints]] were [[Expulsion of Mormons from Jackson County, Missouri|driven from the area]] in 1833, the beginning of a conflict which culminated in the [[1838 Mormon War]]. Several branches of this movement gradually returned to the city beginning in 1867, with many making their headquarters there. These include the [[Community of Christ]] (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], the [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]] and the [[Restoration Branches]].

Independence saw great prosperity from the late 1830s through the mid-1840s, while the business of outfitting pioneers boomed. Between 1848 and 1868, it was a hub of the [[California Trail]]. On March 8, 1849, the [[Missouri General Assembly]] granted a [[home-rule]] [[charter]] to the town and on July 18, 1849, William McCoy was elected as its first mayor. In the mid-19th century an Act of the [[United States Congress]] defined Independence as the start of the [[Oregon Trail]].

[[File:Oregontrail 1907.jpg|thumb|A map of the Oregon Trail, marking Independence.]]
[[File:Trumanhist.JPG|thumb|Harry S. Truman's Independence home, now part of the [[Harry S. Truman National Historic Site]].]]

Two important Civil War battles occurred at Independence: the [[First Battle of Independence|first]] on August 11, 1862, when [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers took control of the town, and the [[Second Battle of Independence|second]] in October 1864, which resulted in a Union victory. The war took its toll on Independence, and the town was never able to regain its previous prosperity, although a flurry of building activity took place soon after the war. The rise of nearby [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] also contributed to the town's relegation to a place of secondary prominence in Jackson County, though Independence has retained its position as county seat to the present day.

United States President [[Harry S. Truman]] grew up in Independence and, in 1922, was elected judge of the Court of Jackson County, Missouri (an administrative, not judicial, post). Although he was defeated for reelection in 1924, he won back the office in 1926 and was reelected in 1930. Truman performed his duties diligently, and won personal acclaim for several popular public works projects, including an extensive series of fine roads for the growing use of automobiles, the building of a new County Court building in Independence, and a series of 12 ''[[Madonna of the Trail]]'' monuments to pioneer women dedicated across the country in 1928 and 1929. He would later return to the city after two terms as president. His wife, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Bess Truman]], was born and raised in Independence, and both are buried there. The [[Harry S. Truman National Historic Site]] (Truman's home) and the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum]] are both located in Independence, as is one of Truman's boyhood residences.

==Geography==
Independence is located on the south bank of the [[Missouri River]], near the western edge of the state. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|78.25|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|77.57|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.68|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=July 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>
