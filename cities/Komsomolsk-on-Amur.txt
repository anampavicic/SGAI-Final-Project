==History==
[[File:Street Komsomoks on Amur1.JPG|thumb|left|A street in Komsomolsk-on-Amur]]

The future site of Komsomolsk-on-Amur was conquered by the [[Mongols]] in the 13th century, becoming part of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. It was later held by the [[Qing dynasty]] until the area was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[treaty of Aigun]] in 1858. The village of '''Permskoye''' ({{lang|ru|Пе́рмское}}) was established on the later site of Komsomolsk in 1860 by migrant peasants from what is now the [[Perm Krai]].

The government of the [[Russian SFSR]] announced in 1931 plans to construct a shipyard on the Amur at the present site of Komsomolsk, with construction beginning in 1932.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} According to official mythology, the town was built using volunteer labor from the [[Communism|Communist]] youth organization [[Komsomol]] (and after 1991, the [[Russian Communist Youth League]]), and on that basis receiving the name '''Komsomolsk'''. However, the construction of the town was done with the extensive use of forced labour from the [[concentration camp]]s under the [[Gulag]] administration, specifically the Dallag (Far East Camp) complex. The site had been the centre of the system for the Khabarovsk krai. According to Adashova and Kovalev, there was not a single entreprise constructed there in the 1930s or 1940s which had not involved Dallag forced labour, and at least 900 thousand of the mentioned forced labourers passed through the area throughout its existence.<ref>Aleksander Solzhenitsyn, ''The Gulag Archipelago: 1918-1956'', 592-593</ref><ref>Т.А. АДАШОВА, В.В. КОВАЛЕВ: Комсомольск-на-Амуре. № 03/2002 газеa "География" </ref>  The suffix ''on Amur'' was added to differentiate from [[Komsomolsk, Russia|other towns with the same name]]. It was granted town status in 1933.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

By the end of the 1940s, the shipyards along with facilities for other heavy industry had been completed. The city developed into a regional center for industries such as [[aircraft manufacturing]], [[metallurgy]], [[machinery]], [[oil refining]], and [[shipbuilding]]. At present, Komsomolsk-on-Amur is the main center for the manufacture of Sukhoi military aircraft and the Sukhoi Superjet airliner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.team.aero/controls/news/view.php?id=392&c=2|title=Team.Aero - Sukhoi Rolls Out Superjet 100 in Aeroflot Livery|website=Team.Aero|access-date=November 1, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014526/http://www.team.aero/controls/news/view.php?id=392&c=2|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[MiG-15]]bis <ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/22074/what-was-the-yearly-number-of-mig-15s-produced|title=What was the yearly number of MiG-15's produced?|website=aviation.stackexchange.com|access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref> and the Lisunov [[Li-2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldwings.nl/st/li2.pdf|title=Beriev Be-6|website=oldwings.nl|access-date=7 June 2023}}</ref> were both manufactured in Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

In the Soviet period, the administrative-territorial division of the city was different from the present. In accordance with the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of 19 October 1943 were formed Lenin, Stalin and Central areas. Stalinsky district included the territory of Railway Amurstali and residential community.

Komsomolsk-on-Amur consists of two historical parts: the center, or "city", where the main enterprise - Shipyard, and the  Dzemgi - an area that has formed during the construction of an aircraft factory (future [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association|
KnAAPO]]). In fact, each of the parts is a separate town, itself a single center in the city.

Areas of the city are very different architectural appearance: Center Stalinist buildings dominated the 40-50s (exception - the residential area near the railway station), Dzemgi is built up mainly typical panel apartment blocks. The "sleeping" area Dzemgi is not, as the majority of their residents work in enterprises located here.
