== Etymology ==
{{See also|History of Odisha#Historical names of Odisha}}
The terms ''Odisha'' and ''Orissa'' ({{Langx|or|ଓଡ଼ିଶା}}, ''Oṛissa'') derive from the ancient [[Prakrit]] word  ''"Odda Visaya"'' (also "''Udra Bibhasha''" or "''Odra Bibhasha''") as in the [[Tirumalai (Jain complex)|Tirumalai]] inscription of [[Rajendra Chola I]], which is dated to 1025.<ref name=orissareview>{{cite book|last1=Patel|first1=C.B|title=Origin and Evolution of the Name ODISA|date=April 2010|publisher=I&PR Department, Government of Odisha|location=Bhubaneswar|pages=28, 29, 30|url=http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/April/engpdf/28-30.pdf|access-date=19 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619163833/http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/April/engpdf/28-30.pdf|archive-date=19 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Sarala Das]], who translated the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into the [[Odia language]] in the 15th century, calls the region 'Odra Rashtra' as Odisha.

The city of [[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]] in Odisha is also known to have been the capital of the [[Pauravas]] during the closing years of 4th century CE. Nothing was heard from the Pauravas from about the 3rd century CE, because they were annexed by the [[Yaudheya|Yaudheya Republic]], who in turn submitted to the [[Mauryans]]. It was only at the end of 4th century CE, that they established royalty at Brahmapur, after about 700 years.

Later, the kings of the [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavamsi]] dynasty began to unite the region. By the reign of Yayati II, c. 1025 CE, they had integrated the region into a single kingdom. Yayati II is supposed to have built the [[Lingaraj temple]] at [[Bhubaneswar]].<ref name=GovHistory /> They were replaced by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]]. Notable rulers of the dynasty were [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]], who began reconstruction on the present-day Shri [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]] (c. 1135), and [[Narasimhadeva I]], who constructed the [[Konark temple]] (c. 1250).<ref name="Dalal2014">{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87k0AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT559|access-date=3 February 2015|date=18 April 2014|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-396-7|page=559|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105110846/https://books.google.com/books?id=87k0AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT559|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="IndianHistory">{{cite book|title=Indian History| year=1960 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4j7Nf_MU24C&pg=SL2-PA3|access-date=3 May 2013|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-132923-1|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101141813/http://books.google.com/books?id=X4j7Nf_MU24C&pg=SL2-PA3|archive-date=1 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to a [[Forest Survey of India]] report released in 2012, Odisha has 48,903&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of wild forest, covering 31.41% of the state's total area. The forests are classified into areas of dense forest (7,060&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), medium dense forest (21,366&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), open forest (forest without closed [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]; 20,477&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and [[Shrubland|scrub forest]] or scrubland (4,734&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The state also has [[bamboo forest]]s (10,518&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and tidal areas of [[mangrove]] swamp (221&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The state is gradually losing its wilderness areas to [[Illegal logging|timber smuggling]], [[deforestation]], destructive mining, and general urban industrialisation, as well as livestock [[grazing]]. There have been attempts at conservation and [[reforestation]].<ref name=ForrestCover>{{cite news|title=Study shows Odisha forest cover shrinking|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Study-shows-Odisha-forest-cover-shrinking/articleshow/11904659.cms|access-date=5 February 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=16 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017164642/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Study-shows-Odisha-forest-cover-shrinking/articleshow/11904659.cms|archive-date=17 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Simlipal National Park]] is a protected wildlife area and Bengal tiger reserve spread over 2,750&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of the northern part of [[Mayurbhanj district]]. The park has around 1,078 species of plants, including 94 of the aforementioned orchids. The [[sal tree|''sal'']] is the primary tree species. For fauna, the park is home to around 55 species of [[mammal]], including the [[Bengal tiger]], [[axis deer|chital]], [[chousingha]], [[common langur]], [[gaur]], [[Indian elephant]], [[Indian giant squirrel]], [[jungle cat]], [[Indian leopard|leopard]], [[Indian muntjac|muntjac]], [[sambar deer|sambar]], [[small Indian civet]] and [[wild boar]]. There are over 300 species of birds in the park, such as the [[common hill myna]], as well as [[Indian grey hornbill|grey]], [[Indian pied hornbill|Indian pied]] and [[Malabar pied hornbill]]s. There are also some 60 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the famed [[king cobra]], plus [[banded krait]] and [[tricarinate hill turtle]].

The [[Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary]] is a 190&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> protected area near the capital city, Bhubaneswar. However, urban expansion and over-grazing have reduced the forests, driving the herds of elephants to migrate away, as well as increasing human-elephant conflicts—which sometimes results in injury and death (on both sides). Some elephants have died in conflicts with villagers, while some have died during migration after being accidentally electrocuted by power lines or even hit by trains. Outside the protected area, they are killed by ivory [[Poaching|poacher]]s. In 2002, there were about 80 elephants, but by 2012, their numbers had been reduced to 20. Many of the animals have migrated toward the Barbara Reserve forest, Chilika, [[Nayagarh district]], and [[Athagad]].<ref name=ElephantBanished>{{cite news|title=Banished from their homes|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/item/52316-banished-from-their-homes.html|access-date=5 February 2015|work=[[The Pioneer (newspaper)|The Pioneer]]|date=29 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904034144/http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/item/52316-banished-from-their-homes.html|archive-date=4 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=ElephantWipeout>{{cite news|title=Away from home, Chandaka elephants face a wipeout|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Away-from-home-Chandaka-elephants-face-a-wipeout/2013/08/23/article1747976.ece|work=[[The New Indian Express]]|date=23 August 2013|access-date=5 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205151829/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Away-from-home-Chandaka-elephants-face-a-wipeout/2013/08/23/article1747976.ece|archive-date=5 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Besides elephants, the sanctuary also has leopards, jungle cats and herds of chital.<ref name="Negi1993">{{cite book|author=Sharad Singh Negi|title=Biodiversity and Its Conservation in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC&pg=PA242|access-date=5 February 2015|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-85182-88-9|page=242|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105110846/https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC&pg=PA242|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Odisha is home to several Hindu figures. [[Bhima Bhoi|Sant Bhima Bhoi]] was a leader of the [[Mahima Dharma|Mahima sect]]. [[Sarala Das]], a Hindu [[Khandayat]], was the translator of the epic [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. Chaitanya Das was a [[Vaishnavism|Buddhistic-Vaishnava]] and writer of the ''Nirguna Mahatmya''. [[Jayadeva]] was the author of the ''[[Gita Govinda]]''.

The ''Odisha Temple Authorisation Act'' of 1948 empowered the government of Odisha to open temples for all Hindus, including Dalits.<ref name="ReferenceA">P. 63 ''Case studies on human rights and fundamental freedoms: a world survey, Volume 4'' By Willem Adriaan Veenhoven</ref>

Perhaps the oldest scripture of Odisha is the ''[[Madala Panji]]'' from the Puri Temple believed from 1042&nbsp;AD. Famous Hindu Odia scripture includes the 16th-century ''Bhagabata'' of [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]].<ref>P. 77 ''Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 30'' By Scholastic Library Publishing</ref> In the modern times [[Madhusudan Rao]] was a major Odia writer, who was a [[Brahmo Samaj]]ist and shaped modern Odia literature at the start of the 20th century.<ref>''Madhusudan Rao'' By Jatindra Mohan Mohanty, Sahitya Akademi</ref>
