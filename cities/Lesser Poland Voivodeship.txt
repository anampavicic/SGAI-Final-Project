'''Lesser Poland Voivodeship''' ({{langx|pl|województwo małopolskie}} {{IPA|pl|vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ mawɔˈpɔlskʲɛ||LL-Q809 (pol)-KaMan-województwo małopolskie.wav}}) is a [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]] in southern [[Poland]]. It has an area of {{convert|15108|km2|sqmi|0}}, and a population of 3,404,863 (2019).<ref name="population">{{Cite web|last=GUS|title=Population. Size and structure and vital statistics in Poland by territorial division in 2019. As of 30th June|url=https://stat.gov.pl/en/topics/population/population/population-size-and-structure-and-vital-statistics-in-poland-by-territorial-division-in-2019-as-of-30th-june,3,26.html|access-date=2020-09-11|publisher=stat.gov.pl|language=en}}</ref>

The province's name recalls the traditional name of a historic Polish region, Lesser Poland, or in Polish: {{lang|pl|[[Małopolska]]}}. Current Lesser Poland Voivodeship, however, covers only a small part of the broader ancient Małopolska region. Historic Lesser Poland is much larger than the current province. It stretches far north, to [[Radom]], and [[Siedlce]], also including such cities, as [[Lublin]], [[Kielce]], [[Częstochowa]], and [[Sosnowiec]].

The province is bounded on the north by the [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]] ({{lang|pl|Góry Świętokrzyskie}}), on the west by ''[[Jura Krakowsko-Częstochowska]]'' (a broad range of hills stretching from [[Kraków]] to [[Częstochowa]]), and on the south by the [[Tatra mountains|Tatra]], [[Pieniny Mountains|Pieniny]] and [[Beskidy Mountains]]. Politically it is bordered by [[Silesian Voivodeship]] to the west, [[Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship]] to the north, [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]] to the east, and [[Slovakia]] ([[Prešov Region]] and [[Žilina Region]]s) to the south.

Almost all of [[Lesser Poland]] lies in the [[Vistula River]] catchment area. The city of [[Kraków]] was one of the [[European Cities of Culture]] in 2000. Kraków has railway and road connections with [[Katowice]] (expressway), [[Warsaw]], [[Wrocław]] and [[Rzeszów]]. It lies at the crossroads of major international routes linking [[Dresden]] with [[Kyiv]], and [[Gdańsk]] with [[Budapest]]. Located here is the second largest [[international airport]] in Poland (after [[Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport|Warsaw]]'s), the [[John Paul II International Airport]].

==Economy==
The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the province was €40.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 8.1% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €19,700 or 65% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 72% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

The region's economy includes [[high tech]]nology, banking, chemical and [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] industries, [[coal]], [[ore]], [[food processing]], and spirit and [[tobacco]] industries. The most industrialized city of the voivodeship is [[Kraków]]. The largest regional enterprise operates here, the Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks in [[Nowa Huta]], employing 17,500 people. Another major industrial center is located in the west, in the neighborhood of Chrzanów (chiefly the production of railway engines) and [[Oświęcim]] (chemical works). Kraków Park Technologiczny, a [[special economic zone]], has been established within the voivodeship. There are almost 210,000 registered economic entities operating in the voivodeship, mostly small and medium-sized, of which 234 belong to the state-owned sector. Foreign investment, growing in the region, reached approximately US$18.3 billion by the end of 2006.

==Universities==
[[File:Jagiellonian University 12.jpg|thumb|left|[[Collegium Maius, Kraków|Collegium Maius]], [[Jagiellonian University]], [[Kraków]]]]
A total of 130,000 students attend fifteen Kraków institutions of higher learning. The [[Jagiellonian University]], the largest university in the city (44,200 students), was founded in 1364 as [[Cracow Academy]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and Karol Wojtyła ([[Pope John Paul II]]) graduated from it. The [[AGH University of Science and Technology]] (29,800 students) is considered to be the best technical university in Poland. The Academy of Economics, the Pedagogical University, the [[Cracow University of Technology|Kraków University of Technology]] and the Agricultural Academy are also very highly regarded. There are also the Fine Arts Academy, the State Theatre University and the Musical Academy. [[Nowy Sącz]] has become a major educational center in the region thanks to its Higher School of Business and Administration, with an American curriculum, founded in 1992. The school has 4,500 students. There are also two private higher schools in Tarnów.

==History==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|thumb|left|15th-century view of Kraków]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], the territory was inhabited by the [[Vistulans]], an old [[Polish tribes|Polish tribe]]. It formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century, with the regional capital [[Kraków]] becoming the seat of one of Poland's oldest dioceses, est. in 1000, contributing to the [[Christianization of Poland]]. In 1038, Kraków became the capital of Poland by decision of [[Casimir I the Restorer]], retaining its role for several centuries with short-term breaks. It also became the location of the [[Jagiellonian University]], Poland's oldest university and one of world's oldest, established by King [[Casimir III the Great]]. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], [[Oświęcim]] and [[Zator, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Zator]] were ducal seats of local lines of the [[Piast dynasty]]. Following the late-18th-century [[Partitions of Poland]], the region witnessed several uprisings against foreign rule, i.e. the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] of 1794, [[Kraków uprising]] of 1846 and [[January Uprising]] of 1863–1864, and Kraków remained one of the main cultural centers of partitioned Poland, taking advantage of the more relaxed policies of the [[Austro-Hungary|Austrian]] partitioners than those of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussians]] and [[Russian Empire|Russians]]. In the [[interbellum]], the region was part of reborn independent Poland.

During [[World War II]], it was [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied by Germany]], with the occupiers committing their genocidal policies against [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|Poles]] and [[The Holocaust|Jews]] in the region, massacring civilians and prisoners of war, including at [[Szczucin massacre|Szczucin]] and [[Bloody Wednesday of Olkusz|Olkusz]], operating prisons, [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camps and, most notably, the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] with a network of subcamps in various localities. There was also a [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|German prisoner-of-war camp]] for [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]], Belgian, Dutch and Soviet prisoners of war.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Banaś|first1=Jan|last2=Fijałkowska|first2=Grażyna|year=2006|title=Miejsca Pamięci Narodowej na terenie Podgórza|location=Kraków|language=pl|page=30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945.

[[File:Krainy-historyczne-Polski.png|thumb|Historical regions in Lesser Poland Voivodeship and in Poland]]
The Lesser Poland Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former [[Kraków Voivodeship (1975–1998)|Kraków]], [[Tarnów Voivodeship|Tarnów]], [[Nowy Sącz Voivodeship|Nowy Sącz]] and parts of [[Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship|Bielsko-Biała]], [[Katowice Voivodeship|Katowice]], [[Kielce Voivodeship|Kielce]] and [[Krosno Voivodeship|Krosno]] Voivodeships, pursuant to the [[Polish local government reforms]] adopted in 1998.

==Climate==
Located in Southern [[Poland]], Lesser Poland is the warmest place in Poland with average summer temperatures between {{convert|23|C|F}} and {{convert|30|C|F}} during the day, often reaching {{convert|32|C|F}} to {{convert|38|C|F}} in July and August, the two warmest months of the year. The city of [[Tarnów]], which is located in [[Lesser Poland]], is the hottest place in Poland all year round, average temperatures being around {{convert|25|C|F}} during the day in the three summer months and {{convert|3|C|F}} during the day in the three winter months. In the winter the weather patterns alter each year; usually winters are mildly cold with temperatures ranging from {{convert|-7|C|F}} to {{convert|4|C|F}}, but the winter season changes often to a more humid and warmer winter, or more continental and cold, depending on the many various wind patterns that affect Poland from different regions of the world. [[Błędów Desert]], the only desert in Poland, is located in Lesser Poland, where temperatures can often reach {{convert|38|C|F}} in the summer.

==Tourism==
[[File:Wieliczka salt mine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wieliczka Salt Mine]], [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]
Lesser Poland Voivodeship is the voivodeship with the highest number of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s in Poland with six entries, encompassing the [[Kraków]] Old Town with the [[Wawel|Wawel Royal Castle]], former main royal residence and burial site of Polish monarchs, the old salt mines of [[Bochnia Salt Mine|Bochnia]] (Europe's oldest) and [[Wieliczka Salt Mine|Wieliczka]], the pilgrimage town of [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska]], the former Nazi German concentration camp [[Auschwitz]] in [[Oświęcim]], the [[wooden churches of Southern Lesser Poland]], and the [[wooden Tserkvas of the Carpathian Region in Poland and Ukraine]].

Four national parks and numerous reserves have been established in the voivodeship to protect the environment of [[Lesser Poland]]. The region has areas for tourism and recreation, including [[Zakopane]] (Poland's most popular winter resort) and the Tatra, [[Pieniny]] and Beskidy Mountains. There are ten [[spa town]]s: [[Krynica-Zdrój]], [[Muszyna]], [[Piwniczna-Zdrój]], [[Rabka-Zdrój]], [[Szczawnica]], [[Wapienne]], [[Wieliczka]], [[Wysowa-Zdrój]], [[Zakopane]], [[Żegiestów]].

[[File:DJI 0332 Wawel.jpg|thumb|[[Wawel Castle]] in Kraków, [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]

The voivodeship is rich in historic architecture ranging from [[Romanesque architecture in Poland|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. Numerous towns possess preserved historic market squares and town halls, as in Kraków and [[Tarnów]].

The voivodeship, especially Kraków, is home to various museums, art galleries and cultural institutions. Major museums include the [[National Museum in Kraków]] with the branch [[Czartoryski Museum]], one of the oldest museums of Poland, which contains works by various artists including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Rembrandt]] and Kraków-native [[Jan Matejko]], and the [[Archaeological Museum of Kraków]], the oldest archaeological museum in Poland. There are museums dedicated to painters [[Jan Matejko House|Jan Matejko]] and [[Józef Mehoffer]] at their former homes in Kraków, to composer and pianist [[Karol Szymanowski]] and writer [[Kornel Makuszyński]] at their homes in Zakopane, to writer [[Władysław Orkan]] at his home in [[Poręba Wielka, Limanowa County|Poręba Wielka]] and to writer [[Emil Zegadłowicz]] in his manor in [[Gorzeń Górny]]. [[Manggha]], the largest Polish museum of Japanese art, is located in Kraków.

There are numerous World War II memorials in the province, including a museum at the site of the former [[Nazi concentration camp]]s [[Auschwitz]]-I and Auschwitz-II-Birkenau, as well as the [[Auschwitz Jewish Center in Oświęcim|Auschwitz Jewish Center]], visited annually by a million people.
