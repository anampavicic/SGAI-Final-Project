From 1516 to 1521, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] lived in the town castle as an administrator and then in Mehlsack (Melzak, now [[Pieniężno]]).

On February 3, 1807, the [[Battle of Allenstein]] took place. The [[Grande Armée|French Army]] clashed with the Imperial Russian army. On that day, Allenstein was visited by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Napoleon gathered enormous forces in the city and planned to engage the Russians and Prussians in a decisive battle. The Russian army was stationed in [[Jonkowo]], but retreated after the French attack. Thanks to the victory at Allenstein, Napoleon's army was able to move north and a few days later the general [[Battle of Eylau]] took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castlesofpoland.com/prusy/olsz_hist.htm|title=Historia Olsztyna – Castles of Poland|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

After the defeat of Germany in World War I, the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] was held in 1920 to determine whether the populace of the region, including Allenstein, wished to remain in German [[East Prussia]] or become part of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which had just regained independence.

In 1991 [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the city.<ref name=ho/> In 1999 the [[University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn]] was established, which is now one of the largest universities in northeastern Poland.

Olsztyn became the capital of the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] in 1999. It was previously in the [[Olsztyn Voivodeship]].

===Olsztyn Castle===
[[File:Zamek Olsztyn (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Olsztyn Castle]]]]
The [[Olsztyn Castle]] was built between 1346–1353 and by then it had one wing on the north-east side of the rectangular courtyard. Access to the castle leads from the drawbridge over the river Łyna, surrounded by a belt of defensive walls and a moat. The south-west wing of the castle was built in the 15th century, the tower situated in the west corner of the courtyard, from the middle of the 14th century, was rebuilt in the early 16th century and had a round shape on a square base and was 40 meters high. At the same time, the castle walls were raised to a height of 12 meters and a second belt of the lower walls was built. The castle walls were partly combined with city walls, which made the castle look as if it had been a powerful bastion defending access to the city. 
The castle was owned by Warmia Chapter, which until 1454, together with the [[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia]], was under the military protection of the [[Teutonic Knights]] and their [[State of the Teutonic Order|Monastic State in Prussia]].<ref name="Zamek w Olsztynie">{{Cite web |url=https://www.olsztyndzisiaj.pl/zamek-w-olsztynie/#:~:text=Zamek%20w%20Olsztynienale%C5%BCa%C5%82%20do%20kapitu%C5%82y%20warmi%C5%84skiej.%20Podlega%C5%82a%20ona,polskim%20i%20przej%C4%85%C5%82%20go%20zarz%C4%85d%20Janusza%20I%20Mazowieckiego. |language=pl |title=Zamek w Olsztynie |website=olsztyndzisiaj.pl |date=1 June 2011 |access-date=9 March 2023}}</ref>

The castle had played a huge role in the Polish-Teutonic wars by then. After the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, the Poles took it after a few days siege. In the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)]] it was jumping from rule to rule. The Knights threatened the castle and the town in 1521, but the defense was very effective. They contained one failed assault. There is a connection between the history of the castle, the city of Olsztyn, and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. He prepared the defense of Olsztyn against the invasion of the Teutonic Knights in 1520.<ref name="Zamek w Olsztynie"/>

[[File:647373 Olsztyn Zamek.. 04.JPG|thumb|Interior of the Olsztyn Castle]]

In the sixteenth century, there were two prince-bishops of Warmia that stayed there: [[Johannes Dantiscus]] – the first [[Sarmatism|Sarmatian]] poet, endowed with the imperial laurel wreath for "Latin Songs" (1538, 1541) and [[Marcin Kromer]], who wrote with equal ease in Latin and Polish scientific and literary works (1580). Kromer consecrated the chapel of St. Anna, which was built in the south-west wing of the castle. In the course of time, both wings of the castle lost military importance, which for residential purposes has become very convenient. In 1779, Prince-Bishop [[Ignacy Krasicki]] stopped here as well.

After the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] annexation of Warmia during the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, the castle became the property of the state board of estates (''Kriegs- und Domänenkammer''&nbsp;— War and Domain Chamber). In 1845, the bridge over the moat was replaced by a causeway better connecting the castle with the city. In 1901–1911 a general renovation of the castle was performed, however, several sections of the building were violated at the same time where they changed the original look of the castle e.g. putting on window frames in a cloister. The tower was topped off in 1921 and again in 1926.<!--What does this mean? -- in the halls of the castle, became a museum.-->

In 1945, the whole castle became home to the Masurian Museum, which today is called the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. In addition, there are also popular events held within the frameworks of the Olsztyn Artistic Summer and so-called "evenings of the castle" and "Sundays in the Museum".

===Jewish community===

Although [[Jews]] were permitted to trade in the city itself and its fairs during the [[medieval]] times, they were restricted from trading freely in the villages surrounding the town.<ref>W. Knercer, Cmentarze i zabytki kultury żydowskiej w województwie olsztyńskim, "Borussia", no. 6, 1993, p. 53; vide K. Forstreuter, Die ersten Juden in Ostpreussen, "Altpreussische Forschungen", ch. 14, 1937, pp. 42–48.</ref> In 1718, Bishop [[Teodor Andrzej Potocki]] imposed a ban on Jewish trade in the city as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/5,history/#footnote_0|title=History – Jewish community before 1989 – Olsztyn – Virtual Shtetl|access-date=17 November 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101153323/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/5,history/#footnote_0|archive-date=1 January 2014}}</ref> The ban, even if continued by successive bishops, proved not to be particularly successful in the light of repeated complains by the local merchants about Jewish dealing in animal leather and similar products as the one recorded in 1742. Permanent Jewish settlement can be dated to 1780 when the Jews were finally permitted to settle in the city albeit outside the immediate city walls.<ref>J. Jasiński, Olsztyn w latach 1772 – 1918, in: Olsztyn "1353 – 2003, ed. S. Achremczyk, W. Ogrodziński, Olsztyn 2003, p. 228.</ref> In 1814, the Simonson brothers opened the first Jewish store. Yet the growth of the Jewish community worried city authorities, who tried to curb it with restrictions and punitive measures. In 1850, a new law imposed fines and imprisonment on anyone who harboured a “wandering” Jew in their home.<ref>J. Jasiński, Olsztyn w latach 1772 – 1918, in: Olsztyn 1353 – 2003, ed. S.

[[File:Bet Tahara in Olsztyn Außenansicht 2012.jpg|thumb|Former [[Mendelsohn House|Jewish Tahara house]]]]
The roots of the Jewish congregation in the town can be traced to 1820. Shortly after that date, an official prayer room was established on Richterstraße. In 1877, the congregation bought a plot of land on Liebstädterstraße and built a synagogue there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/11,synagogues-prayer-houses-and-others/322,old-synagogue/|title=Old synagogue – Synagogues, prayer houses and others – Heritage Sites – Olsztyn – Virtual Shtetl|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> A Jewish cemetery was built on Seestraße (present-day Grunwaldzka). At its peak, the town's Jewish population reached 448 people (1933).

During the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', the town synagogue was destroyed by Nazi Germans, only to be later used as a bomb shelter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?pid=71&sid=92:allenstein|title=Archive – east-prussia – Allenstein|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> Today, the site of the former synagogue is occupied by a local sports club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/cms/activity/863,jewish-culture-in-olsztyn/|title=Jewish culture in Olsztyn – Virtual Shtetl|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

By 1939, only 135 Jews were left in the city. The remainder fled the country. Those who still lived in the town by 1940 were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/directory.html#frmResults (matches for "Allenstein", with marked: "Wohnort" and "Geburtsort"; (as of 25 March 2009); http://www.yadvashem.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_2KE?next_form=advanced_search (people living in Olsztyn before the war – matches for "Allenstein", with marked: "Before the War", (as of 25 March 2009); http://www.yadvashem.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_2KE?next_form=advanced_search (people born in Olsztyn – matches for "Allenstein", with marked: "Birth"; (as of 25 March 2009).</ref> In June 1946, 16 [[Holocaust]] survivors settled in the city and in 1948, the congregation had 190 worshipers. Most of them emigrated to [[Israel]] throughout the next few decades. There is no trace of the Jewish cemetery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/12,cemeteries/1944,cemetery/|title=Jewish Cemetery (Zyndrama z Maszkowic Street) – Cemeteries – Heritage Sites – Olsztyn – Virtual Shtetl|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

The city was the birthplace of world-famous Jewish architect [[Erich Mendelsohn]].

=== Greenbelt ===
More than half of the forests occupying 21.2% of the city area form a single complex of the Municipal Forest (1050 ha) used mainly for recreation and tourism purposes. Within the Municipal Forest area are situated two peat-land flora sanctuaries, [[:pl:Mszar|Mszar]] and [[Redykajny]]. Municipal greenery (560 ha, 6.5% of the town area) developed in the form of numerous parks, green spots and three cemeteries over a century old. The greenery includes 910 monuments of nature and groups of protected trees in the form of [[beech]], [[oak]], [[maple]] and [[Tilia|lime]]-lined avenues.{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}
