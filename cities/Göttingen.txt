The [[River Leine]] runs through it. At the end of 2019, the population was 118,911.<ref>{{in lang|de}} [https://www.statistik.niedersachsen.de/startseite/ ''Statistische Monatshefte  Niedersachsen'']</ref>

==Overview==
The origins of Göttingen lay in a village called ''Gutingi, ''first mentioned in a document in 953 AD. The city was founded northwest of this village, between 1150 and 1200 AD, and adopted its name. In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times the city was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] and hence a wealthy town.

[[File:Göttingen Gänseliesel März06.jpg|thumb|left|Landmark [[Gänseliesel]] fountain at the main market]]
Today, Göttingen is famous for its old university (''Georgia Augusta'', or [[University of Göttingen|"Georg-August-Universität"]]), which was founded in 1734 (first classes in 1737) and became the most visited university of Europe. In 1837, seven professors protested against the absolute sovereignty of the [[House of Hanover|kings]] of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]; they lost their positions, but became known as the "[[Göttingen Seven]]". Its alumni include some well-known historical figures: the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[Heinrich Ewald]], [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus|Georg Gervinus]]. Also, German Chancellors [[Otto von Bismarck]] and [[Gerhard Schröder]] attended law school at the Göttingen University. [[Karl Barth]] held his first professorship here. Some of the most famous mathematicians in history, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[David Hilbert]], were professors at Göttingen.

Like other university towns, Göttingen has developed its own quaint traditions. On the day they are awarded their doctorate degrees, students are drawn in handcarts from the Great Hall to the ''Gänseliesel''-Fountain in front of the Old Town Hall. There they have to climb the fountain and kiss the statue of the ''Gänseliesel'' (''goose girl''). This practice is actually forbidden, but the law is not enforced. The statue is considered the most kissed girl in the world.

Nearly untouched by Allied bombing in [[World War II]], the inner city of Göttingen is now an attractive place to live with many shops, cafes and bars. For this reason, many university students live in the inner city and give Göttingen a youthful feel. In 2003, 45% of the inner city population was only between 18 and 30 years of age.

Commercially, Göttingen is noted for its production of optical and precision-engineered machinery, being the seat of the [[light microscopy]] division of [[Carl Zeiss]], Inc., and a main site for [[Sartorius AG]] which specialises in bio-technology and measurement equipment—the region around Göttingen advertises itself as "Measurement Valley".

Unemployment in Göttingen was 12.6% in 2003 and is now 7% (March 2014). The city's [[Göttingen station|railway station]] to the west of the city centre is on Germany's main north–south railway.

Göttingen has two [[BG Göttingen|professional basketball teams]]; both the men's and women's teams play in the ''Basketball-Bundesliga''. For the [[2022–23 Basketball Bundesliga|2022–23]] season, both teams will play in the 1st division.

===Early history===
The origins of Göttingen can be traced back to a village named ''Gutingi'' to the immediate south-east of the present city. The name of the village probably derives from a small stream, called the ''Gote'', that once flowed through it. Since the ending ''-ing'' denoted "living by", the name can be understood as "along the Gote". [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence points towards a settlement as early as the 7th century. It is first historically mentioned in a document by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in 953 AD, in which he gives some of his belongings in the village to the Moritz monastery in [[Magdeburg]]. Archaeological findings point to extensive commercial relations with other regions and a developed craftsmanship in this early period.

===Imperial palace of Grona===
In its early days, ''Gutingi'' was overshadowed by ''[[:de:Pfalz Grona|Grona]]'', historically documented from the year 915 AD as a newly built fortress, lying opposite ''Gutingi'' on a hill west of the River Leine. It was subsequently used as an [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] [[Kaiserpfalz|imperial palace]], with 18 visits of kings and emperors documented between 941 and 1025 AD. The last Holy Roman emperor to use the fortress of ''Grona'' (said to have been fond of the location), [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich II]] (1002–1024), also had a church built in the neighbouring ''Gutingi'', dedicated to [[Saint Alban]]. The current church building that occupies this site, the St. Albani Church, was built in 1423.

The fortress then lost its function as a palace in 1025, after Henry II died there, having retreated to it in ill health. It was subsequently used by the lords of Grone. The fortress was destroyed by the citizens of Göttingen between 1323 and 1329, and finally razed to the ground by Duke Otto I during his feuds with the city of Göttingen in 1387.

===Foundation of the town===
With time, a trading settlement started to form at the river crossing of the Leine to the west of the village, from which it took its name. It is this settlement that was eventually given city rights. The original village remained recognisable as a separate entity until about 1360, at which time it was incorporated within the town's fortification.

It is likely the present city was founded between 1150 and 1180, although the exact circumstances are not known. It is presumed that [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Bavaria]], founded it. The configuration of the streets in the oldest part of the town is in the shape of a [[pentagon]], and it has been proposed that the inception of the town followed a planned design. At this time, the town was known by the name ''Gudingin'' or also ''Gotingen''. Its inhabitants obeyed [[House of Welf|welfish]] ownership and ruling rights, and the first Göttingen [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] are mentioned then, indicating that Göttingen was already organised as a true city. It was not, however, a [[Free Imperial City]] ({{langx|de|Reichsstadt}}), but subject to the Welf dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg. [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Henry the Elder]] (V) of Brunswick, eldest son of Henry the Lion and brother of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]], is given as the lord over Göttingen between 1201 and 1208. The original Welf residency in the town consisted of a farm building and the stables of the Welf dukes, which occupied the oldest part of the city's fortifications built prior to 1250. In its early days, Göttingen became involved in the conflicts of the Welfs with their enemies. The initial conflicts in the first decades of the 13th century benefited the burghers of Göttingen, who were able to use the political and military situation to be courted by various parties, thus forcing the Welf town lords to make certain compromises with the town. In a document from 1232, Duke [[Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Otto the Child]] restored to the citizens of Göttingen the rights that they had held at the time of his uncles Otto IV and Henry the Elder of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]. These included privileges concerning self-governance of the town, protection of traders, and facilitating trade. At this time Göttingen possessed a city council of burghers. The names of council members are first given in a document from 1247.
[[File:ISH WC Goettingen24.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Geismar Tor]]

===Expansion===

The area secured by the initial fortification included the old market place, the old town hall, the two main churches, St. Johannes (''St John's'') and St. Jacobi (''St. James's''), the smaller church St. Nikolai (''St. Nicholas's''), as well as the large Weender Straße, Groner Straße and Rote Straße (''red street''). Outside the fortification in front of the ''Geismar'' city gate lay the old village with the Church of St. Alban, which was subsequently known as ''Geismarer altes Dorf'' (old ''Geismar'' village). This village was only to a limited extent under Welfish control and thus could not be included in the town's privileges and fortifications.

The town was initially protected by a rampart, as of the late 13th century, then also by walls on top of the mound-like ramparts. Of these, only one tower with a short stretch of the wall survives in the ''Turmstraße'' (tower street). This protected area included maximally {{convert|600|by|600|m}}, or about {{convert|25|ha}}. This made it smaller than contemporary [[Hanover]], but larger than the neighbouring Welfish towns of [[Northeim]], [[Duderstadt]] and [[Hann. Münden]].

The ''Gote'' stream that flowed south of the walls of the town was connected to the [[River Leine]] via a channel at about this time and the waterway has since been known as the Leine Canal.
[[File:ISH WC Goettingen21.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Marienkirche]]

After the death of Otto the Child in 1257, his sons [[Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Albert I of Brunswick]] (the Great) and [[John of Brunswick, Duke of Lüneburg|Johann]] inherited their father's territories. Duke Albrecht I governed for his brother, a minor, at first. Subsequently, the brothers agreed to divide the territory between themselves in 1267, effective 1269. The city of Göttingen went to Albert I, and was inherited by his son Duke [[Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Albert II]] "the Fat" in 1286. Albert II chose Göttingen as his residence and moved into the Welf residency, which he rebuilt into a fortress known as the ''Ballerhus'', after which the ''Burgstraße'' (fortress street) is named.

Albert II attempted to gain further control over the economically and politically rapidly growing town by founding a ''new town'' ({{langx|de|Neustadt}}) west of the original town, across the Leine Canal and outside of the Groner City Gate. This competing settlement consisted of a single street, no more than {{convert|80|yd|m|order=flip}} long, with houses on either side of the street. The Duke, however, could not prevent Göttingen's westward expansion nor the success of the Göttingen City Council in effectively checking any hope of economic development in the ''Neustadt''. The St. Marien Church (''St. Mary's'') was built to the south of the ''Neustadt'' which, together with all adjoining farm buildings, was given to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1318.

After the failure of the ''new town'', the city council bought up the uncomfortable competition to the west in 1319 for three hundred [[Mark (money)|Marks]], and obtained a promise from the Duke that he would not erect any fortress within a mile of the town.

Two [[monastery|monasteries]] were also founded on the edge of the town at the end of the 13th century. To the east, in the area of today's ''Wilhelmsplatz'', a [[Franciscan]] monastery was built as early as 1268, according to the city chronicler Franciscus Lubecus. Since the Franciscans walked barefoot as part of their vow of poverty, they were known colloquially as ''the barefoot people'', hence the name ''Barfüßerstraße'' (Barefoot People's Street) for the road that led to the monastery. In 1294, Albert the Fat permitted the founding of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery along the Leine Canal opposite the ''Neustadt'', for which the [[SS. Peter and Paul's Church, Göttingen|''Paulinerkirche'']] (''[[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Pauline]] church''), completed in 1331, was constructed.

[[German Jews|Jews]] settled in Göttingen in the late 13th century. On 1 March 1289, the Duke gave the City Council permission to allow the first Jew, Moses, to settle inside the town limits. The subsequent Jewish population lived predominantly close to St. James's Church on the ''Jüdenstraße''.

===Growth and independence===
After Albert the Fat's death in 1318, Göttingen passed to [[Otto the Mild, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Otto the Mild]] (d. 1344), who ruled over both the "[[Principality of Göttingen]]" ({{langx|de|Fürstentum Göttingen}}) and the territory of Brunswick. These dukes joined Göttingen and surrounding towns in battles against aristocratic knights in the surroundings of Göttingen, in the course of which the citizens of Göttingen succeeded in destroying the fortress of Grone between 1323 and 1329, as well as the fortress of Rosdorf. Since Otto the Mild died without leaving any children, his brothers Magnus and Ernest divided the land between themselves. Ernest I received Göttingen, the poorest of all the Welf principalities, which was to remain separate from Brunswick for a long time to come. At this time, the territory consisted of the regions formerly owned by Northeim, the towns of Göttingen, Uslar, Dransfeld, Münden, Gieselwerder and half of Moringen. Not much is known about the rule of Duke Ernest I, but it is generally assumed that he continued to fight against aristocratic knights.

Ernest I was succeeded after his death in 1367 by his son Otto I of Göttingen (the Evil; German: ''der Quade'') (d. 1394), who initially lived in the city's fortress and attempted to make it a permanent Welf residency. The epithet ''the Evil'' came from Otto I's incessant feuds. Breaking with the policies of his predecessors, he frequently aligned himself with the aristocratic knights of the neighbourhood in battles against the cities, whose growing power disturbed him. Under Otto the Evil, Göttingen gained a large degree of independence. After losing control of the provincial court at the Leineberg to Göttingen in 1375, Otto finally tried to impose his influence on Göttingen in 1387, but with little success. In April 1387, Göttingen's citizens stormed and destroyed the fortress within the city's walls. In retaliation, Otto destroyed villages and farms in the town's surroundings. However, Göttingen's citizens gained a victory over the Duke's army in a battle between the villages of Rosdorf and Grone, under their leader Moritz of Uslar, forcing Otto to acknowledge the independence of the town and its surrounding properties. 1387 thus marks an important turning point in the history of the town. Göttingen's relative autonomy was further strengthened under Otto's successor Otto II "the One-eyed" of Göttingen ({{langx|de|Cocles/der Einäugige}}), not least because the Welf line of Brunswick-Göttingen died out with Otto II, and the resulting questions surrounding his succession after his abdication in 1435 destabilized the regional aristocracy.

After Duke Otto I of Göttingen relinquished his jurisdiction over Jews to the town of Göttingen in the years 1369–70, conditions for Jews greatly deteriorated, and several bloody persecutions and evictions from the town followed. Between 1460 and 1599, no Jews lived in Göttingen at all.

The trend towards ever diminishing Welf influence over the town continued until the end of the 15th century, although the town officially remains a Welf property. Nevertheless, it is counted in some contemporaneous documents among the [[Free Imperial City|Imperial Free Cities]].

[[File:St Johannis Church Goettingen memming.jpg|thumb|St. John's Church|240px]]
[[File:Goe Jacobi Church.jpg|thumb|St. Jacobi's Church|240px]]
The 14th and 15th centuries thus represent a time of political and economic power expansion, which is also reflected in the contemporary architecture. The expansion of the St. Johannis Church to a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[hall church]] began in the first half of the 14th century. As of 1330, a Gothic structure also replaced the smaller St Nikolai Church (''St. Nicholas's''). After completion of the work on St John's Church, the rebuilding of St James's Church was begun in the second half of the 14th century. The original, smaller church that preceded this building was probably initiated by Henry the Lion or his successor, and functioned as a fortress chapel to the city fortress that lay immediately behind it. The representative old town hall was built between 1366 and 1444.

Around 1360, the town's fortifications were rebuilt to encompass now also the ''new town'' and the ''old village''. In the course of this construction work, the four city gates were moved farther out, and the town's area grew to roughly {{convert|75|ha}}. The city council forged alliances with surrounding towns, and Göttingen joined the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1351 (see below). Göttingen also gained ''Grona'' (currently Grone) and several other surrounding villages in the Leine Valley.

The reason for the progressive increase in importance in the late [[Middle Ages]] was the growing economic strength of the town. This depended largely on its good connections with the north–south trade route, particularly the north–south trade route that followed the Leine Valley, which greatly aided the local [[textile]] industry in particular. Next to the [[guild]] of [[linen]] weavers, the guild of wool weavers gained in importance. The wool for the weaving originated in the immediate surroundings of the town, where up to 3000 sheep and 1500 lambs were kept. Woollen cloth was successfully exported all the way to the [[Netherlands]] and [[Lübeck]]. From 1475, textile production was augmented by the addition of new weavers who brought novel weaving techniques to Göttingen and consolidated the position of the town as a textile exporter for three generations. Only at the end of the 16th century did the decline of the local textile industry occur when Göttingen could not compete anymore with cheap [[England|English]] textiles.

Göttingen's traders also profited from the important trade route between [[Lübeck]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Göttingen's market became important beyond the region. Traders from other regions would come in great numbers four times a year. Göttingen also joined the [[Hanseatic League]], to the first meeting of which it was invited in 1351. Göttingen's relationship with the Hanseatic League remained distant, however. As an inland town, Göttingen enjoyed the economic connections of the League, but it did not want to get involved in the politics of the alliance. Göttingen only became a paying member in 1426, and left as early as 1572.

===Loss of independence to the present day===
After several dynastic splits and shifts in power that followed the death of Otto the One-Eyed, Duke Eric I "the Elder", Prince of [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]], annexed the principality of Göttingen, which became an integral part of the [[Principality of Calenberg]]. The town refused to pay homage to Eric I in 1504, and as a result, Eric I had the Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], declare the town of Göttingen outlawed. The subsequent tensions economically weakened Göttingen, leading to the town finally paying its homage to Eric I in 1512. Afterward the relationship between Eric and the town improved, because of Eric's financial dependence on Göttingen.

[[File:Goettingen - Ansicht der Stadt von Westen (1585).png|thumb|220px|left|Woodcut showing the town in the year 1585 as viewed from the west]]
In 1584 the city came into the possession of the dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, also of the Welf dynasty, and in 1635 it passed to the house of Lüneburg, which ruled it thenceforth. In 1692 it was named as part of the indivisible territory [[Prince-elector|Electoral]] State of Hanover (officially the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]).

The [[University of Göttingen]] was founded in 1737 by [[George II of Great Britain|George II Augustus]], who was king of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], [[Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] and [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|prince-elector of Hanover]].<ref>{{cite EB9 |wstitle = Göttingen |volume= X | pages = 854&ndash;855 |short=1}}</ref>

During the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] period, the city was briefly in the hands of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1806, turned over in 1807 to the newly created Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], and returned to the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|State of Hanover]] in 1813 after Napoleon's defeat. In 1814 the prince-electors of Hanover were elevated to kings of Hanover and the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] was established. During the Austro-Prussian War (1866), the Kingdom of Hanover had attempted to maintain a neutral position. After Hanover voted in favor of mobilizing confederation troops against Prussia on 14 June 1866, Prussia saw this as a just cause for declaring war. In 1868, the Kingdom of Hanover was dissolved and Göttingen became part of the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]]. The Province of Hanover was disestablished in 1946.

In 1854 the city was connected to the new [[Hanoverian Southern Railway]]. Today, [[Göttingen station|Göttingen railway station]] is served by ([[Intercity-Express|ICE]]) high-speed trains on the [[Hanover–Würzburg high-speed railway|Hanover–Würzburg high-speed line]].

==== Nazi era (1933–1945) ====
During the 1930s, Göttingen housed the top math-physics faculty in the world, led by eight men, almost all Jews, who became known as the Göttingen eight. Their members included [[Leó Szilárd]] and [[Edward Teller]]. This faculty was not tolerable to the Reich, however, and the [[University of Göttingen]] suffered greatly as a result. The Göttingen eight were expelled, and these men were forced to emigrate to the West in 1938. Szilárd and Teller went on to become key members of the [[Manhattan Project]] team. Ironically, the Nazi insistence on "[[Deutsche Physik|German physics]]" prevented German scientists from applying [[Albert Einstein]]'s breakthrough insights to physics, a policy which stifled the further development of physics in Germany. After the end of [[World War II]], the famous university had to be reorganised almost from scratch, especially in the [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[chemistry]] departments, a process which has continued into the 21st century.<ref>Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, ''Emigration of Mathematicians and Transmission of Mathematics: Historical Lessons and Consequences of the Third Reich'', Report No. 51/2011; organized by June Barrow-Green, Milton-Keynes, [[Della Dumbaugh|Della Fenster]], Joachim Schwermer, & Reinhard Siegmund-Schultze.

There was considerable support in the population of Göttingen for Hitler and Nazism from the start of the National Socialist era. As early as 1933 the Theaterplatz (Theater Square) was renamed Adolf-Hitlerplatz, and by the end of World War II 70 streets had been renamed in reference to the Nazi regime or military topics.<ref name="tamke">Tamke G. & Driever R.

Also, there was a concentration camp for [[adolescent]]s in [[Moringen]], which was not liberated until 1945.

During the widespread [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[United States|American]]  [[Strategic bombing|air raid]]s on [[Nazi Germany]], Göttingen suffered comparatively little damage. Only about 2.1% of the city was destroyed.<ref>Ulrich Schneider: ''Niedersachsen 1945'', p. 95. Hannover 1985</ref> Beginning in July 1944, the air raids were sometimes heavier, but these mainly hit the area of the main [[railway station]] last on 7 April 1945. The historic old town of Göttingen remained practically undamaged.

The ''Junkernschänke'', a historic half-timbered house, was destroyed in a 1945 air-raid and the exterior was not properly reconstructed until the 1980s. Two of the churches (''Paulinerkirche'' and ''Johanniskirche'') in the old town, and several buildings of the [[university]], were heavily damaged. The Institute of Anatomy and 57 residential buildings, especially in Untere Masch Street in the centre of the city, were completely destroyed. Overall, only about 107 deaths were caused by the air raids, a comparatively small number. However, the neighbouring [[cities]] of [[Hanover]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] experienced a much greater impact from the bombing raids. [[Kassel]] was destroyed several times.

Because the city had many hospitals, those hospitals had to take care of up to four thousand wounded [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers and airmen during World War II. Göttingen was also fortunate in that before troops of the [[U.S. Army]] arrived in Göttingen on 8 April 1945,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtarchiv.goettingen.de/chronik/1945_04.htm |title=Chronik für das Jahr 1945 |access-date=13 February 2019 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919211627/http://www.stadtarchiv.goettingen.de/chronik/1945_04.htm |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> all of the Wehrmacht's combat units had departed from this area, hence Göttingen experienced no heavy ground fighting, [[artillery]] [[bombardment]]s or other major combat.

==== Modern history====
The [[Göttingen Studios]] were a significant centre of film production in [[West Germany]] from 1948 to 1961. In a reform in 1973 the district of Göttingen was enlarged by incorporating the dissolved districts of [[Duderstadt]] and [[Hannoversch Münden]].

[[File:Gottingenculturalnight.jpg|thumb|240px|Göttingen Nacht der Kultur (Göttingen Cultural Night)]]
Prior to the period of German [[romanticism]], a group of German poets that had studied at this university between 1772 and 1776, formed the [[Göttinger Hainbund]] or "''Dichterbund''" ('circle of poets'). Being disciples of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]], they revived the folksong and wrote lyric [[poetry]] of the [[Sturm und Drang]] period. Their impact was essential on romanticism in the German-speaking area and on folklore in general.

Since the 1920s, the town has been associated with the revival of interest in the music of [[George Frideric Handel]]. The [[Göttingen International Handel Festival]] is held each summer with performances in the Stadthalle Göttingen and a number of churches.

The city is home to several ensembles such as the Göttinger Sinfonie Orchester<ref>{{Cite web|title=Startseite – GSO :: Göttinger Symphonie Orchester|url=http://www.gso-online.de/|website=www.gso-online.de|access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref> or the [[Göttingen Boys' Choir]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Göttinger Knabenchor – Musik. Gestalten. Erleben.|url=https://www.goettinger-knabenchor.de/|language=de-DE|access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref> which are also performing nationwide.

In the mid-1960s, the song named after the city by the French singer [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]] created a considerable popular impetus towards post-war Franco-German reconciliation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21126353 |title=BBC News website, 22 January 2013 |work=BBC News |date=22 January 2013 |access-date=20 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109164741/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21126353 |archive-date=9 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A street in the city – Barbarastraße – is named after her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtarchiv.goettingen.de/strassennamen/tamke-driever%20goettinger%20strassennamen_01.pdf |last1=Tamke |first1=Gerd |last2=Driever |first2=Rainer |title=Göttinger Staßennamen |publisher=Stadtarchiv Göttingen |date=2012 |access-date=13 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065352/http://www.stadtarchiv.goettingen.de/strassennamen/tamke-driever%20goettinger%20strassennamen_01.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because of the city's long association with academics and scholarly journals, Göttingen has acquired the motto ''Die Stadt, die Wissen schafft.'' The phrase is a pun: ''Die Stadt der Wissenschaft'' means 'the city of science,' ''Die Stadt, die Wissen schafft'' (identical pronunciation apart from ''der'' ~ ''die'') means 'the city that creates knowledge.'

Göttingen is a part of a [[tourist]] attraction in Germany, the [[German Fairy Tale Route]] ([[German language|German]]: Deutsche Märchenstraße).

==Incorporations==

With the arrival of the early modern period, the growth rate greatly accelerated. The population peaked at 132,100 in 1985. In 2004, it stood at 129,466, of which around 24,000 were students.

==Transport==
The Göttingen bus system is run by the GöVB (Göttinger Verkehrsbetriebe). Buses run throughout the city and to the neighboring villages, as well as [[intercity bus service]]s from the station Göttingen ZOB, adjacent to the railway station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/goettingen|title=Göttingen: Stations|publisher=Travelinho.com|access-date=2 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203015228/http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/goettingen|archive-date=3 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Göttingen station|Göttingen railway station]] lies west of the medieval town center and provides links to several destinations in Germany.

Like most German cities, the town is bicycle-friendly, with bicycle paths throughout the commercial areas (except for in pedestrian-only shopping areas) and beyond.  The time to pedal downtown from the outskirts is  fifteen to twenty minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.hna.de/lokales/goettingen/kommentar-e-bike-test-goettingen-firmen-kauft-fahrraeder-3955813.html|title = HNA Kommentar zum E-Bike-Test in Goettingen|date = 26 September 2014|publisher = HNA|last = Kopietz|first = Thomas|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142859/http://www.hna.de/lokales/goettingen/kommentar-e-bike-test-goettingen-firmen-kauft-fahrraeder-3955813.html|archive-date = 2 April 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>

==Religion==

[[File:Goettingen StMichael Oct06.jpg|thumb|240px|St. Michael Church]]
After the Middle Ages, the area of Göttingen was part of the [[archbishopric of Mainz]], and most of the population were [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic]]. Starting in 1528, the teachings of church reformer [[Martin Luther]] became more and more popular in the city. In 1529 the first [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] sermon was preached in the Paulinerkirche, a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery church. For many centuries, nearly all of the population of the city were [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. As of today, the area of Göttingen is part of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover|Lutheran Church of Hanover]]. Apart from this [[state church]], there are several [[Religion in Germany#Christianity|other Protestant churches]] in Göttingen, known as ''[[Free churches|Freikirchen]]''. In 1746, Catholic services in Göttingen were resumed, at first only for the students of the new university, but a year later for all citizens who wished to attend. However, it was not until 1787 that the first Catholic church since the Reformation, St. Michael's, was built. In 1929 a second Catholic church, St. Paul's, was erected. Today, the major religions are Lutheran and Catholicism. In addition, there has been a [[Baptist]] congregation since 1894, a [[Mennonite]] congregation since 1946, as well as a congregation of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].{{CN|date=March 2024}}

There is a documented Jewish community dating back to the 16th century. During the Third Reich, the [[synagogue]] was destroyed in the ''[[Kristallnacht|Reichspogromnacht]]'' on 9 November 1938, as were many others throughout Germany. The Jewish community was persecuted, and many of its members were murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. In recent years, the Jewish community has again been flourishing, with the immigration of Jewish people from the states of the former [[Soviet Union]]. In 2004, the first [[Shabbat]] could be celebrated in the new Jewish community centre.
Finally, there are many [[Islam]]ic congregations. Islam gained a foothold in Göttingen, as it did in other German cities, with the immigration of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' during the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' in the 1960s and 1970s. They constitute the majority of Muslims in Göttingen. Other Muslims are of [[Arab people|Arab]] origin or come from West Asia. There are two mosques in the city.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.local-masjid.com/mosques/gottingen/63292 | title=The 5 mosques and prayer times in Göttingen (37073) – Local Masjid }}</ref>

There is a [[secularism|secular]] trend in Germany, especially in [[Former eastern territories of Germany|Eastern Germany]], but also in the [[Western Germany|West]], where a growing number of people are not [[baptism|baptised]] or leave the church. This trend is especially noticeable since the 1990s, percentagewise between 1990 and 2014 the Protestants in Göttingen dropped from 56.2 to 40.6% and the Catholics dropped from 17.1 to 15.6%.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.goesis.goettingen.de/pdf/022_20.pdf |title=Religion in Göttingen 1990–2014 |access-date=16 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122953/http://www.goesis.goettingen.de/pdf/022_20.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Unsourced section|date=March 2024}}
A town council with 24 councillors dates from the 12th century. In 1319 this council took control of the new city district (''Neustadt'') just in front of the wall. The council election took place on the Mondays following [[Michaelmas]] (29 September). Starting in 1611 all citizens were able to elect the 24 councillors. Previously this right was restricted and depended on income and profession. Afterwards, the council elected the ''Bürgermeister'' (mayor). In 1669 the number of councillors was reduced to 16, and later to 12. In 1690 the city administration was reorganised again. Then the council consisted of the judge, two mayors, the city lawyer (''Syndikus''), the secretary and eight councillors. All of these were appointed by the government. During the Napoleonic era the mayor was called ''Maire'', and there was also a city council. In 1831 there was another reform of the constitution and the administration. The title of the mayor changed to ''Oberbürgermeister''. In the following decades there were more reforms to the city administration, which reflected the constitutional and territorial reorganisations of Germany. During the Third Reich the mayor was appointed by the [[Nazi Party]].

In 1946 the authorities of the British Occupation Zone, to which Göttingen then belonged, introduced a communal constitution which reflected the British model.

==Coat of arms==
The [[coat of arms]] of Göttingen shows in the top half three silver towers with red roofs on a field of blue. The lateral towers possess four windows each and are crowned by golden crosses. Around the central tower are four silver balls. The city towers represent the status as a city which has been granted certain rights. In the bottom field is a golden lion on a red field. This lion represents the lion of the Welf dynasty, which in its various branches ruled the area of Göttingen for 850 years. This coat of arms was first documented in 1278. The city has sometimes used a simpler one, consisting of a black capital "G" on a golden field, topped with a crown.

==International relations==
The city is the [[namesake]] of [[Foreign Protestants|Göttingen Street]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].
