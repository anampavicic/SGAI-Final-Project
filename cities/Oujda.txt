'''Oujda''' ({{langx|ar|وجدة}}, {{IPA|ar|ˈwa(d)ʒda|pron}}) is a major city in northeast [[Morocco]] near the [[Algeria–Morocco border|border]] with [[Algeria]]. Oujda is the capital city of the [[Oriental (Morocco)|Oriental]] region of northeastern Morocco and has a population of 720,618 people (2022 census). It is located about {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the Moroccan-Algerian border in the south of the [[Iznasen|Beni Znassen]] Mountains and about {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=in}} south of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coast.

== History ==
[[File:Oujda.medina. tour de control.jpg|thumb|Ancient mirador]]
=== Origins ===
There is some evidence of a settlement during the Roman occupation, which seems to have been under the control of [[Berbers]] rather than Romans.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oypmAAAAMAAJ |title=L'image de la Tingitane: l'historiographie arabe médiévale et l'antiquité nord-africaine |trans-title=The image of Tingitana: medieval Arab historiography and North African antiquity |last=Siraj|first=Ahmed |date=1995-01-01 |publisher=Boccard |isbn=9782728303175 |pages=589–595 |language=fr}}</ref>

The city was founded in 994 by [[Ziri ibn Atiyya]], Berber chief of the [[Zenata]] [[Maghrawa]] tribe. Ziri was, with his tribe, authorized to occupy the region of Fas, but feeling insecure in that region and that town, and wishing to be nearer to the central Maghrib homeland of his tribe, he moved to Ouajda, installed there a garrison and his possessions, appointing one of his relatives as governor.<ref name="EI2" />

=== 11th to 19th centuries ===
In the mid-11th century, a new quarter with a wall was allegedly added to the primitive core. [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] occupied the city in 1079, and in the next century, it came under [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] control, with its fortifications repaired and strengthened under the Almohad caliph [[Muhammad al-Nasir]].<ref name="EI2">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2002|title=Wad̲j̲da|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/wadjda-COM_1325|publication-place=Leiden, Netherlands|edition=2nd|volume=XI|pages=23–24|isbn=9004081143|last1=Marçais|first1=G.|last2=Troin|first2=J.F.|editor1-link=Peri Bearman|editor3-link=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|editor5-link=Wolfhart Heinrichs|editor1-last=Bearman|editor1-first=P.|editor2-last=Bianquis|editor2-first=Th.|editor3-last=Bosworth|editor3-first=C.E.|editor4-last=van Donzel|editor4-first=E.|editor5-last=Heinrichs|editor5-first=W.P.}}</ref>

Oujda played an important strategic role between the [[Marinid Sultanate|Marinids]], based in [[Fes]], and the [[Abdalwadid]]s of the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]].<ref name="EI2" /> The Marinid sultan [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd al-Haqq|Abu Yusuf Yaqub]] destroyed the city when he defeated Sultan [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yaghmorasan]] in 1271. When his successor [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr|Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] conquered the city again in 1296, he destroyed the remaining fortifications but then rebuilt the town with the new walls, a palace, and a [[Grand Mosque of Oujda|Great Mosque]] (the current one). The town continued to change hands, however. Around 1325, Sultan [[Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman|Abu al-Hasan]] took the city again during a series of campaigns which extended Marinid control into the central Maghreb for a brief period.<ref name="EI2" />

Because of its frontier position, the city was frequently contested between the [[Sharifism|Sharifian]] dynasties of Morocco – the [[Saadi Sultanate|Saadis]], followed by the [['Alawi dynasty|Alaouites]] – to the west and the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the east, from the 16th century onward.<ref name="EI2" /> It was often attached to the province or region of Tlemcen, which itself also changed hands several times in this period. During the long reign of [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Isma'il]] (1672–1727), Oujda was firmly under Alaouite control and defended by new fortifications and garrisons built by the sultan. After Isma'il's death, however, political instability returned. It was only in 1795 that the city was retaken by the Alaouite empire and permanently incorporated into Morocco.<ref name="EI2" />

The French occupied it in 1844 and again in 1859. To the west of the city is the site of the [[Battle of Isly]] which occurred in 1844. In 1907-1908, Oujda was reconquered by General Bugeaud and Marshal [[Hubert Lyautey|Lyautey]] and used as a French military base to control eastern Morocco. The modern city owes much of its present form to the French, who developed along the roads built at that time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

=== 20th century and present day ===
[[1948 Anti-Jewish Riots in Oujda and Jerada|Anti-Jewish riots]] occurred in Oujda June 1948, during the [[1948 Palestine war]] in the aftermath of [[Declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel|the establishment]] of the [[State of israel|State of Israel]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Gottreich |first=Emily |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781838603601 |title=Jewish Morocco |date=2020 |publisher=I.B.

In 1954, from the beginning of the [[Algerian Independence War]], Morocco allowed Oujda to become the logistic center of the [[Oujda Group]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The Moroccan border with Algeria is just east of Oujda; on the other side of the border is the Algerian town of [[Maghnia]]. The border has been closed since 1994.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2021-07-04 |title=Letter from Africa: Lamenting the Algeria-Morocco border closure |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57467644 |access-date=2023-01-21}}</ref> 

In 2010, Rod Solaimani chronicled his trip to Oujda for [[MTV]].

==Geography==
The city is located {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the Mediterranean sea and {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Algeria, with an estimated altitude of {{convert|450|m|0|abbr=off}}.

{{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} south from city centre, is [[Jbel Hamra]], a typical [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub|Mediterranean forest]] and into the east of this forest is [[:fr:Parc Sidi Mâafa|Sidi Maafa park]].

Oujda is located in the south of [[Beni Znassen]] mountains.

===Climate===
The city has a [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk''). Rainfall is between {{convert|300|mm|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year. It rarely snows in winter; last snowfall was on 5 February 2012. Weather in Oujda is cool but still tepid and wet in winter, hot and dry in summer.

[[File:Oujda centre1.jpg|200px|thumb|Oujda, Bd Mohamed V]]
The main characteristic of the city is having the old city in the centre. The old city maintains traditional features of the Moroccan architecture with its narrow, winding alleys which lead to the houses and markets such as the jewelry market and the leather market. The [[Grand Mosque of Oujda]] is one of its historically most important mosques.

Bled el Gaada is a [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] ruins just outside of [[Ouijda, Morocco|Ouijda]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} The ruins consist of a Roman fort measuring {{convert|175|by|210|m}}.<ref>{{Cite book |last=MacKendrick |first=Paul Lachlan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rH26vL2CWbkC&dq=Bled+el+Gaada+roman&pg=PA312 |title=The North African Stones Speak |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8078-4942-2 |page=312 |language=en}}</ref>

==Music==
[[Gharnati music|Gharnati]] refers to a variety of music originating in Andalusia. Its name was derived from the Arabic name of the Spanish city of Granada. Gharnati constitutes the musical mode mostly used in Oujda, where besides this musical kind is omnipresent and where each year in June the International Festival of Gharnati music is held.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia =The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517067-2 |editor-last=Sadie |editor-first=Stanley |edition=2nd |editor-last2=Tyrrell |editor-first2=John |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.42951 |title=Algeria, People's Democratic Republic of}}</ref>

[[Reggada]] Music is a major traditional music movement. Its a Moroccan Amazigh ancient musical genre and traditional war dance from the Beni Znassen/Aït Iznasen tribes of north-east Morocco (Provinces of Oujda, Berkane and Taourirt), more precisely coming from the village called Ain-Reggada. This dance used to celebrate and emulate victory of a battle.

==Transport==
Tourists aiming at Saïdia, bordering the Mediterranean, transit to Oujda's airport. The city is served by [[Angads Airport]], which has connecting international flights to Lisbon, Brussels, Madrid, Marseille or Paris for example, as well as domestic flights to Casablanca.

The city is the endpoint of the main railroad from [[Casablanca]] via [[Fes]] and Taourirt before the border with [[Transport in Algeria|Algeria]]. There are several day and night trains to and from the city, linking it to the western part of the country. 

The [[Oriental Desert Express]] was originally built in the 1920s and 1930s as part of the [[Mediterranean–Niger Railway]]. One of its cars, the historical "prince's wagon" passenger car runs now twice annually. Outside camera shots of the Oriental Desert Express were featured in the 2015 James Bond film [[Spectre (2015 film)|''Spectre'']].<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 September 2017 |title=Morocco tourists make tracks on 007's 'desert express' |url=https://www.dw.com/en/bonds-desert-express-for-morocco-tourists/a-40604541 |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=dw.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Economy==
Oujda has a strategic importance because of its location on the border. There are many economic and natural resources, however, the city struggles historically with an unemployment rate higher than the national average, standing on average at 20% compared to the 10.3% national average.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oujda |url=https://www.climamed.eu/project/our-countries/morocco/oujda/ |access-date=2024-09-06 |website=Clima-Med |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Morocco Unemployment Rate |url=https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/morocco/unemployment-rate |access-date=2024-09-06 |website=www.ceicdata.com}}</ref>

Oujda relies heavily on trading given its location near the borders of Algeria. The economy of the city is directly related to the border's condition as it represents a passage for businesses directed towards [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] in the west, Talmasan in the east, [[Figuig]] in the south and [[Melilla]] in the north.<ref>{{Cite web |last=MobiliseYourCity Global Monitor |date=20 October 2021 |title=MobiliseYourCity Global Monitor Fact Sheet: Oujda, Morocco |url=https://www.mobiliseyourcity.net/sites/default/files/2021-10/Oujda%2C%20Morocco.pdf |website=MobiliseYourCity.net}}</ref> 

On 18 March 2003, King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] indicated the importance of reviving the economy of the Eastern regions of Morocco. As a result of this effort, [[Technopole]] Oujda was established and the region witnessed road improvement, airport expansion and other projects.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Projet - Medz Support {{!}} MEDZ |url=https://www.medz.ma/en/projet/technopole-doujda |access-date=2024-09-06 |website=www.medz.ma}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=African Development Bank Group |title=Third Airport Project Appraisal Report for the Kingdom of Morocco |publisher=African Development Bank Group |language=French (original)}}</ref>

==Sport==

The sports infrastructure in Oujda is composed of a municipal stadium, an Olympic venue, the [[Honneur Stadium]] of Oujda, built in 1976, the sports complex 'Rock' including a [[Rugby football|rugby]] stadium, a complex [[tennis]] in the park Lala Aicha, a [[golf]] course and two sports halls.
