It consists of the [[eponymous]] '''Hainan Island''' and various smaller islands in the [[South China Sea]] under the province's administration. The name literally means "South of the Sea".

The province has a land area of {{convert|33920|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, of which Hainan Island is {{Convert|32900|km2|mi2|-2|sp=us}} and the rest is over 200 islands scattered across three [[archipelagos]]: [[Zhongsha Islands|Zhongsha]], [[Xisha Islands|Xisha]] and [[Nansha Islands|Nansha]]. It was part of [[Guangdong]] from 1950 to 1988, after which it was made a province of its own and was designated as a [[special economic zones of China|special economic zone]] by [[Deng Xiaoping]], as part of the [[Chinese economic reform]] program.

The Han [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] population, who compose a majority of the population at 82%, speak a wide variety of languages including [[Standard Chinese]], [[Hainanese|Hainam Min]], [[Yue Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese]], etc.<ref>Simons, Gary F.; Fennig, Charles D., eds. (2017). ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World'' (20th ed.). Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Chinese, Min Nan.</ref>  Indigenous peoples such as the [[Hlai people|Hlai]], a [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]]-speaking [[ethnic group]], are native to the island and compose 15% of the population. Their native languages include the [[Hlai languages]]. The Hlai are recognized by the Chinese government as one of the country's 56 [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]]. Speakers of [[Be language|Be]], despite speaking a Kra-Dai language, are reckoned officially as ethnically Han Chinese. Hainan is also home to the [[Jiamao language]], of disputed provenance.

There are ten major cities and ten [[Counties of China|counties]] in Hainan Province. The capital of the province is [[Haikou]], on the northern coast of Hainan Island, while [[Sanya]] is a well-known tourist destination on the southern coast. The other major cities are [[Wenchang]], [[Sansha]], [[Qionghai]], [[Wanning]], [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]], [[Dongfang, Hainan|Dongfang]] and [[Danzhou]].

According to China's [[nine-dash line|territorial claims]], several disputed territories in the [[South China Sea]], including the [[Spratly Islands]] (''Nansha'') and [[Paracel Islands]] (''Xisha''),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349|title=Why is the South China Sea contentious? – BBC News|work=BBC News|date=12 July 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=16 August 2016|archive-date=13 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211213024410/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349|url-status=live}}</ref> are administered under Sansha city of the province.

In 2020, a large-scale plan was announced by the Chinese government to transform the entire island province into a [[Free-trade zone|free trade port]], with the aim of turning it into the largest free-trade port in the world by 2035. The plan involves building a hub for offshore financing and duty-free shopping, as well as using lower taxes and reduced visa requirements to help draw in foreign businesses and tourists. Moreover, all goods sold from Hainan to other parts of China would be treated as imports from 2025 onward.<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 June 2020|title=Hainan FTZ to Establish China's Biggest Free Trade Port by 2035|url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/hainan-ftz-masterplan-released-establish-chinas-biggest-free-trade-port-2035/|access-date=1 January 2021|website=China Briefing News|language=en|archive-date=22 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122110941/https://www.china-briefing.com/news/hainan-ftz-masterplan-released-establish-chinas-biggest-free-trade-port-2035/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=China's Hainan free trade port: Introducing an innovative tax regime to attract investment|url=https://www.internationaltaxreview.com/article/b1n8bgfxnnnydw/chinas-hainan-free-trade-port-introducing-an-innovative-tax-regime-to-attract-investment|access-date=1 January 2021|website=International Tax Review|date=7 September 2020|language=en-gb|archive-date=22 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122091328/https://www.internationaltaxreview.com/article/b1n8bgfxnnnydw/chinas-hainan-free-trade-port-introducing-an-innovative-tax-regime-to-attract-investment|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=7 February 2023 |title=Exclusive: 'China's Hawaii' plans to ease entry for Hong Kong retailers, goods |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3209386/hainan-pitches-rules-help-hong-kong-retailers-goods-enter-booming-consumer-market-chinas-hawaii |access-date=12 February 2023 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=<!--Check author names--> |first= |title=China's Hainan free-trade port tipped to deepen Asean ties |language=en |work=Bangkok Post |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2301366/chinas-hainan-free-trade-port-tipped-to-deepen-asean-ties |access-date=12 February 2023}}</ref>

==Names==
The provincial name derives from its major island, Hainan, in Hainanese "Hai Nam", which is named after its position south of the [[Qiongzhou Strait]]. (To the north of the strait, the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] in Guangdong is also known as ''Haibei/Hai Bac'' or "North of the Sea".) Former names for Hainan Island include '''Zhuya''', '''Qiongya''', and '''Qiongzhou'''. The latter two gave rise to the [[Chinese abbreviations|provincial abbreviation]] {{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|琼}}}} (''Qióng/Kheng'').

During the 17th and 18th centuries, explorers referred to the island as "'''Aynam'''",<ref>{{cite web|title=Map of the Island of Aynam|url=http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/en/object/?id=7512|access-date=2 February 2015|publisher=Atlas of Mutual Heritage|archive-date=15 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215194806/https://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/en/object/?id=7512|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Dampier|first1=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCdDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA8|title=Mr. Dampier's Voyages|publisher=London: James & John Knapton|year=1729|series=Mr.Dampiers Voyages Around the World|volume=2|author-link=William Dampier}}</ref> which remains the pronunciation of its name in the local [[Hainanese]] dialect.

==History==
[[File:Hainan 1820-1875.jpg|thumb|19th century map of Hainan]]

===Prehistoric era===
According to some scholars, Hainan was originally attached to the Northeastern part of what is now [[Vietnam]]; however, the island was formed after it physically broke away from [[Vietnam]] due to a [[volcanic eruption]] and drifted southeast near China after the [[Mesozoic]], millions of years ago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.scmp.com/news/china/article/1938422/chinas-southern-island-hainan-born-out-vietnam-millions-years-ago-study|title=China's southern island of Hainan born out of Vietnam millions of years ago: study|last=Chen|first=Stephen|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=29 April 2017|archive-date=13 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813103311/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1938422/chinas-southern-island-hainan-born-out-vietnam-millions-years-ago-study|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Baiyue people]] are among the earliest [[Kra-Dai]] residents to arrive on Hainan island. They are believed to have settled there at least 2 to 6 thousand years ago, and carry genetic markers from ancient people who reached the island between 7 and 27 thousand years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tracing the legacy of the early Hainan Islanders – a perspective from mitochondrial DNA|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=15 February 2011|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-46|last1=Peng|first1=Min-Sheng|last2=He|first2=Jun-Dong|last3=Liu|first3=Hai-Xin|last4=Zhang|first4=Ya-Ping|volume=11|issue=1 |page=46|pmid=21324107|pmc=3048540 |bibcode=2011BMCEE..11...46P |doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Imperial Era===
[[File:Five officials haikou 2010 01.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the five lords, or five famous exiles to Hainan island]]
Hainan Island was recorded by Chinese officials in 110 BC, when the Western [[Han dynasty]] established a military [[garrison]] there following the arrival of [[Lu Bode|General Lu Bode]]. The process of [[sinicization]] in Hainan was driven by the conjunction of Han territorial expansion and the arrival of Han Chinese military and administrative personnel who settled on the island.   Over the course of many centuries, dynastic Chinese ruling authorities exiled individuals condemned by the imperial courts as criminals or political dissidents were frequently banished to Hainan island and northern Vietnam, regions that were both integral parts governed typically under the jurisdiction of Guangdong province during different Chinese dynasties, where they were subjected to harsh labor in the tropical climate as a form of punishment.

One of the most famous exiled individuals was [[Su Shi]], a well-known intellectual, poet, and politician of the Song era, who offended many of his colleagues and superiors in the royal court. Shi wrote extensively about his exiled experiences on the island during the 11th century AD. After the 11th century AD, large numbers of Han Chinese people from Fujian and Guangdong began migrating to the Leizhou peninsula and Hainan island to settle down their roots by seeking greener pastures on new land to establish themselves. This influx displaced the indigenous Li people, who were among the [[Baiyue]] tribes in southern China, driving them out towards the mountainous regions of the southern portion of the island. Hainan was placed under the administration of Guangdong by the ruling Ming dynasty.

===Republic of China===
Hainan was historically part of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces and as such was the Qiongya [[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuit]] ({{lang|zh-hant|瓊崖道}}) under the 1912 establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In 1921, it was planned to become a [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] ({{lang|zh-hant|瓊崖特別行政區}}); in 1944, it became Hainan Special Administrative Region with 16 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]], including the [[South China Sea Islands]].

During the 1920s and 30s, Hainan was a hotbed of banditry, many opposition politicians{{clarify|date=February 2023}} were hanged, therefore opposition politicians went into hiding. The Communists and the indigenous [[Hlai people]] fought a vigorous [[guerrilla]] campaign against the Japanese, who were only able to occupy some Hainan territories; but in retaliation the Japanese launched numerous massacres against Hlai villages. [[Feng Baiju]] led the Hainan Independent Column of fighters throughout the 1930s and 1940s. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the [[Kuomintang]] reestablished control. Hainan was one of the last areas to eventually come under the administration of the People's Republic, having been under the control of [[Republic of China Armed Forces|ROC forces]] until March 1950. The People's Republic [[Battle of Hainan|attacked Hainan]] on 10 April 1950 and attained complete control on 1 May.

===People's Republic of China===
[[File:爱情海酒店 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A beachside resort in [[Sanya]], the second largest city in Hainan]]
On 1 May 1950, under the People's Republic of China, the Hainan Special Administrative Region became an Administrative Region Office ({{lang|zh-hans|海南行政区公署}}), a branch of the Guangdong provincial government. During the mid-1980s, when Hainan Island was still part of Guangdong Province, a fourteen-month episode of marketing zeal by Hainan Special District Administrator Lei Yu<ref>Subsequently Vice Mayor of Shenzhen SEZ (May 1985 to January 1988), Executive Vice Mayor of Guangzhou (January 1988 to April 1992) and Vice Chairman of Guangxi AR (April 1992 to January 1996).</ref> put Hainan's pursuit of provincial status under a cloud. It involved the duty-free imports from [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] of 90,000 Japanese-made cars and trucks at a cost of [[Renminbi|¥]]&nbsp;4.5 billion (US$1.5 billion), and exporting them – with the help of local naval units – to the mainland, making 150% profits. By comparison, only 10,000 vehicles were imported into Hainan since 1950. In addition, it involved further consignments of 2.9 million TV sets, 252,000 videocassette recorders & 122,000 motorcycles. The money was taken from the 1983 central government funds destined for the construction of the island's transportation infrastructure (roads, railways, airports, harbors) over the next ten years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On 1 October 1984, it became the Hainan Administrative Region ({{lang|zh-hans|海南行政区}}), with its own People's Government, and finally as a province separate from [[Guangdong]] four years later. In 1988, when the island was made a separate province, it was designated a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in an effort to increase investment.

The central government funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities for the construction of the island's other infrastructure (e.g. water works, power stations, telecommunications) and had taken a very liberal interpretation of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the central government to re-finance the special district.

==Geography==
{{See also|Geology of Hainan Island}}
[[File:Hainan topographical map - cropped.jpg|alt=upright=1.35|thumb|Topographic map of Hainan Island]]
Hainan, separated by the {{cvt|20|km|adj=on}} wide [[Qiongzhou Strait]] from the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] of [[Guangdong]], is the 42nd largest island in the world. The area of Hainan Island ({{Convert|32900|km2|mi2|-2|abbr=on}}, 97% of the province) is slightly smaller than that of [[Taiwan]] Island. To the west of Hainan Island is the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. [[Wuzhi Mountain]] is the highest mountain on the island at {{convert|1840|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Hainan Island measures {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} wide.

The northern half of Hainan is covered with the ancient [[Hainan Volcanic Field]]. Beneath the topsoil is [[volcanic rock]] while the topsoil itself contains small pieces of this [[Vesicular texture|vesicular]] rock.

Wetland covers 320,000 hectares, 78,000 hectares of which were created artificially. Most of this is located in the eastern and northern part of Hainan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecns.cn/2016/11-15/233958.shtml|title=China's Hainan island has 320,000 hectares of wetland|website=www.ecns.cn|access-date=19 November 2016|archive-date=15 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215194758/http://www.ecns.cn/2016/11-15/233958.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Rivers and lakes===
Most of the rivers in Hainan originate in the central area of the island and flow radially in different directions. The [[Nandu River]] in the northern part of the island is {{convert|314|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and its [[tributary]], the [[Xinwu River]], is {{convert|109|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. Other major rivers include the [[Wanquan River]] at {{convert|162|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long in the east, [[Changhua River]] in the west, and the [[Sanya River|Sanya]] and [[Taiyang River]]s in the south. Evaporation during the dry season around the coastal areas greatly reduces the flow of the rivers.

There are very few natural lakes in Hainan. However, there are numerous [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]s, the largest of which is the [[Songtao Reservoir]] in the central-north area.

===Islands===
{{Main|Islands of Hainan}}

====Nearby islands====
Several small islands exist around the coast of Hainan Island:
*[[Dazhou Island]] is located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} off the coast of [[Wanning]]
*[[Haidian Island]], on the north coast, is part of Haikou City
*[[Nanwan Monkey Island]], in actuality a peninsula
*[[Phoenix Island]] is an artificial resort island currently under construction in [[Sanya Bay]].
*[[Wuzhizhou Island]] is located within [[Haitang Bay]]
*[[Xinbu Island]] is located directly to the east of [[Haidian Island]]

Due to their close proximity to the main island, the flora, fauna, and the climate are very similar.

===Environment===
Compared to most of mainland China, the air quality of Hainan is significantly better since it is not affected by factory pollution, which has adversely affected the air on the mainland. Throughout 2012, Hainan had the highest air quality in the country for 351 days.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

The provincial government's environmental protection campaign has taken action against a number of industrial plants. During 2012, several outdated manufacturing facilities had their business licenses revoked, and 175 cases related to illegal sewage discharge were handled.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Total sulfur dioxide emissions for the province were 34,000 tons in 2012, a 3 percent year-on-year reduction. In 2011, smog emissions were reduced 6.3 percent to 15,000 tons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Protected areas include the [[Yinggeling National Nature Reserve|Yinggeling]]-Limushan and [[Wuzhi Mountain|Wuzhishan]]-Diaoluoshan nature reserves.<ref name = oneearth/>

}}
The climate of Hainan is mostly tropical. The island's two largest cities, [[Haikou]] and [[Sanya]], both possess a [[Tropical climate|tropical Köppen climate]]. The annual average temperature ranges from {{convert|23|to|28|°C|°F}}, [[Haikou]] is {{convert|24.7|°C|°F}}, [[Sanya]] is {{convert|26.5|°C|°F}}. The coldest months are January when temperatures drop to {{convert|17|to|24|°C|°F}}; the hottest months are June and July, and the temperatures are {{convert|26|to|31|°C|°F}}. The daily average temperature in Hainan in all months is well above {{convert|10|°C|°F}}.

The summer in the northern part is hotter and, {{citation needed span|(for more than 20 days in a year, the temperature can be higher than {{convert|35|°C|°F}}|date=July 2014}})

<!--too much maritime moderation to be true-->. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|1500|to|2000|mm|in|sp=us}} and can be as high as {{convert|2400|mm|sp=us}} in central and eastern areas, and as low as {{convert|900|mm|sp=us}} in the coastal areas of the southwest. Parts of Hainan lie in the path of [[typhoon]]s, and 70% of the annual precipitation is derived from typhoons and the summer rainy season. Major flooding occurs due to typhoons, which can cause many problems for local residents.

====Annual fog====
From January to February, the island of Hainan is often affected by thick fog, particularly in coastal areas and the northern part of the island. This is caused by cold winter air from the north coming into contact with the warmer sea, causing the moisture that evaporates from the sea to be condensed into fog. The fog remains from day to night, and is evenly distributed. Visibility may be reduced to {{Convert|50|m||sp=us}} for days at a time. During this period, residents normally keep windows shut. The moisture in the air is so extreme that the walls in homes weep, and floors often accumulate a layer of water. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There are around 53 [[Genus|genera]], belonging to 29 [[Family (biology)|families]], of wild [[fruit]]s, [[herb]]s and other significant [[crop]]s growing on Hainan—both native and introduced—including several types of [[banana]] (''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'' sp.), as well as [[cashew]] (''[[Cashew|Anacardium occidentale]]''), mango (''[[Mangifera indica]]''), fiber agave ([[Sisal|''Agave sisalana'']]), pineapple (''[[Pineapple|Ananas comosus]]''), bitter melon (''[[Momordica charantia]]''), ivy gourd (''[[Coccinia grandis]]''), giant taro (''[[Alocasia macrorrhizos]]''), Asian taro (''[[Alocasia odora|A. odora]]''), Malabar spinach (''[[Basella alba]]'') and papaya (''[[Papaya|Carica papaya]]'').<ref>Gwinnell, Philip; Han, Bin (2010), ''China's Emerging Jewel, Hainan, The Definitive Guide'', {{ISBN|978-7-5501-0016-9}}., p.23-26</ref> Four species of [[Piperaceae|pepper]] grow on the island as well, including the economically significant black pepper (''[[Black pepper|Piper nigrum]]''). At least 25-30 species belonging to the order [[Zingiberales]] grow on Hainan, including numerous types of [[ginger]], [[galangal]], [[Canna (plant)|canna]], [[turmeric]] (''[[Curcuma]]'' sp.) and prayer-plants ([[Marantaceae]]), among others. Coconuts (''[[Coconut|Cocos]]'' sp.) are a fairly common sight along the coastline. [[Tree]]s found on Hainan include at least 18 species of ''[[Ficus]]'', the Hainan white pine (''[[Pinus fenzeliana]]''), Tenasserim pine (''[[Pinus latteri]]'') and several species of orchid tree (''[[Bauhinia]]'').

4,200 known species of plants are native to the island, including several [[Endemism|endemic]] species, such as those within the genera ''[[Wenchengia]]'' and ''[[Metapetrocosmea]]''.<ref name = oneearth/> Additionally, the ''[[Cathayanthe]]'' and ''[[Chunia]]'' genera are found only on Hainan and in northern Vietnam.

Notable botanical species include:
* [[Hainan yellow lantern chili]] — a [[Capsicum|pepper]] similar to the [[Scotch bonnet]].
* ''[[Cephalotaxus hainanensis]]'' — a species of plum-yew.

===Fauna===
Even with over ten million human inhabitants, Hainan contains several protected areas and wildlife preserves. The most ubiquitous smaller species on the island include such animals as [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, [[Gekkonidae|geckos]], [[skink]]s, and [[Butterfly|butterflies]]; as with many adjacent tropical regions, the [[Arthropod]]a and [[invertebrate]]s are well-represented here, with [[mosquito]]es naturally being very common at certain times of the year. The swarms of biting, flying insects actually play a key role in island [[food chain]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, not only being consumed by many other species (such as [[bat]]s and [[bird]]s) but serving as [[pollinator]]s for many types of [[flowering plant]]s. Hainan's lakes and waterways are populated with various freshwater fishes, such as [[carp]] and [[catfish]], whose [[Juvenile fish|fry]] readily consume both mosquito eggs and larvae (laid on the water's surface) for sustenance.

About 100 [[mammal]]ian species are found on Hainan, with the [[Hainan black crested gibbon]] (''Nomascus hainanus''), the [[Hainan hare]] (''Lepus hainanus''), the [[Hainan moonrat|Hainan gymnure]], or moonrat (''Neohylomys hainanensis''), and the [[Hainan flying squirrel]] (''Hylopetes electilis'') all being [[Endemism|endemic]] to the island. Larger native mammals include the [[Asiatic black bear|Asiatic black]] or "moon" bear (''Ursus thibetanus''), [[sambar deer|sambar]] (''Rusa unicolor''), [[Eurasian otter]] (''L. lutra''), the [[crab-eating mongoose]] (''Herpestes urva'') and the [[leopard cat]] (''Felis bengalensis''), which are considered a species of conservation concern.<ref name="oneearth" /> Other mammals include [[Siberian chipmunk]]s (''Tamias sibiricus''), squirrels, [[masked palm civet]]s and the [[yellow-bellied weasel]].

There are 362 known bird species.<ref name="english.cri.cn"/> Seabirds such as gulls are not generally seen. Egrets and [[Black-winged kite]]s are common in agricultural areas. The [[Hainan partridge]], [[white-eared night heron]], [[Hainan leaf warbler]], and [[yellow-billed nuthatch]] are endemic to the island.<ref name = oneearth/>

Secretive, and sometimes less commonly seen, are the [[Serpentes|snakes]], such as the [[Asian palm pit viper]], the [[red bamboo snake]], and cobras.

In the seas surrounding Hainan, [[sea turtle]]s and [[whale shark]]s are regular visitors.

Hainan island has rich bio-diversity of [[cetacean]]s and is the site of studying these in Chinese waters.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://old.csdata.org/finalPDF/31/%E6%B5%B7%E5%8D%97%E5%B2%9B%E9%B2%B8%E7%B1%BB%E6%90%81%E6%B5%85%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%EF%BC%881993%EF%BD%9E2015%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%89.pdf |script-title=zh:海南岛鲸类搁浅记录数据库（1993 ～ 2015 年） |script-journal=zh:中国科学数据 |year=2016 |volume=2 |doi=10.11922/csdata.170.2015.0029 |access-date=5 March 2017 |archive-date=5 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305194332/http://old.csdata.org/finalPDF/31/%E6%B5%B7%E5%8D%97%E5%B2%9B%E9%B2%B8%E7%B1%BB%E6%90%81%E6%B5%85%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%EF%BC%881993%EF%BD%9E2015%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%89.pdf |title=Ink 500 error }}</ref> Many whales such as [[North Pacific right whale]]s, western [[gray whale]]s, [[humpback whale]]s, and [[blue whale]]s (all of these are almost extinct in Chinese waters)<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Sanya Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at The Chinese Academy Of Sciences|title=Identification Guide for Marine Mammals In the South China Sea|url=http://124.16.218.4/index.php|access-date=19 January 2015|archive-date=19 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119085559/http://124.16.218.4/index.php}}</ref> were historically seen in the winter and spring to mate and calve.

[[Dugong]]s still occur in small number, mostly on [[Gulf of Tonkin]] side.

Notable species include:

* [[Hainan gymnure]] (''Neohylomys hainanensis'' or Hainan moonrat) is a small mammal.
* [[Hainan partridge]] (''Arborophila ardens'') is a species of bird endemic to Hainan Island.

==Demographics==
[[File:Hainan ethnolinguistic 1967.png|right|thumb|Historical ethnolinguistic groups on Hainan, 1967 map. The dark green region is dominated by the [[Hainanese]] varieties of [[Min Chinese]], while people in the light green region mainly speak [[Hlai languages|Li/Hlai languages]] <br />{{smaller|([[:File:China ethnolinguistic 1967.jpg|Link to entire map]] including key)}}.]]
The population density of Hainan is low compared to most coastal Chinese provinces.

In 2000, the ethnic groups of Hainan included the Han-Chinese [[Hainan people|Hainanese]], who are the majority (84% of the population) and speak the Min language, the [[Li people|Li (Hlai)]] (14.7% of the population); the [[Miao people|Miao]] (0.7%) and the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] (0.6%).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Li, who speak a Tai-Kradai language, are the largest indigenous group on the island in terms of population. Also found on the island are the [[Utsul]]s, descendants of [[Cham people (Asia)|Cham]] refugees, who are classified as [[Hui people|Hui]] by the Chinese government because of their Islamic religion. There is a [[Tanka people|Tanka community]] that lives at Sanya Bay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/2011-02/24/content_12068512.htm|title='Water gypsies' fear lifestyle sea change|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=29 April 2017|archive-date=15 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215195423/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/2011-02/24/content_12068512.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Li people mainly reside in the nine cities and counties in the middle and southern part of Hainan – the cities of Sanya, [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]] and Dongfang, the Li autonomous counties of [[Baisha Li Autonomous County|Baisha]], Lingshui, Ledong, [[Changjiang Li Autonomous County|Changjiang]], and the 'Li and Miao Autonomous Counties of [[Qiongzhong Li and Miao Autonomous County|Qiongzhong]] and [[Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County|Baoting]]'. Some others live elsewhere on Hainan with other ethnic groups in Danzhou, Wanning, Qionghai, Lingshui and Tunchang. The area inhabited by the Li ethnic group totals {{convert|18700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, about 55 percent of the province's total.<ref name=sunnysanya>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunnysanya.com/hainan_island/population_people_hainan_island.asp |title=Population and People of Hainan Island |access-date=4 June 2009 |archive-date=6 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306012317/http://www.sunnysanya.com/hainan_island/population_people_hainan_island.asp }}</ref>
[[File:Haikou skyline 2 - 2009 09 07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haikou]], the capital of the province as seen looking south from [[Evergreen Park (Haikou)|Evergreen Park]], a large park located on the north shore of the city]]

Although they are indigenous to the island and do not speak a Chinese language, the [[Ong-Be language|Limgao (Ong-Be)]] people near the capital (8% of the Hainan population) are counted as Han Chinese by the Chinese government.

===Religion===
[[File:East Mosque in Sanya, China.jpg|thumb|The East Mosque in [[Sanya]] is an example of [[Islam in China|Chinese-Islamic]] architecture.]]
Most of the Hainanese population practices [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]]. The [[Li people|Li]] population has a [[Theravada]] Buddhist minority. Most of the [[Utsul]]s of the island, a branch of [[Cham people]] living near [[Sanya]], are [[Muslim]]s. Because Hainan was a point in the travel route of missionaries, there are some [[Christians]]. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.48% of the province's population.<ref name="Wang2015">China General Social Survey (CGSS) 2009.

Nanshan Park is the center of Buddhism on Hainan. Encompassing more than {{convert|50|km2|abbr=on}} of forest. The site includes countless grand temples, statues and spiritual gardens the likes of Savior Garden and Longevity Valley, with intricately trimmed hedges and abundant in lotus flowers, a venerated symbol in Buddhism meaning virtue or purity.

At the heart of the valley is the grand [[Nanshan Temple (Sanya)|Nanshan Temple]], its gates flanked by stone figures of Buddha in front of the Tang dynasty-style entrance. The interior displays images of the Four Heavenly Kings amid statues of other deities enshrined in renderings of stone, gold and jade.

Perhaps{{Weasel inline|date=February 2023}} the most popular{{According to whom|date=February 2023}} site within the Nanshan Buddhist Cultural Zone is the awe-inspiring{{According to whom|date=February 2023}} stone rendering of the Bodhisattva Guan Yin, emerging out of the South China Sea to stand at 108 meters{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}, taller than the [[Statue of Liberty]]{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}.

The Nanshan Buddhist Cultural Zone is visited by thousands of tourists and pilgrims each year who come pay homage to the site that plays a significant role in the religion in China and to sample some of the finest Buddhist vegan cuisine on the island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wenewsit.com/2011/06/spirituality-by-the-sea-in-hainan/ |title=wenewsit.com |publisher=wenewsit.com |access-date=12 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921112717/http://wenewsit.com/2011/06/spirituality-by-the-sea-in-hainan/ |archive-date=21 September 2011 }}</ref>

===Languages===
Most people in Hainan speak a variety of [[Min Chinese]] known as [[Hainanese]]. Other Chinese varieties and non-Chinese languages are spoken as well:

* [[Standard Mandarin]] (''Putonghua'') is widely known as in the rest of China. Mandarin is especially common in the city of [[Sanya]].
** In [[Yancheng|Yacheng City]] (as well as its vicinity several dozen miles west of Huihui and Huixin), the so-called [[military speech]] dialect of Mandarin (the official language of the southwest among the northern Chinese dialects) is spoken.
* [[Cantonese]] is spoken by some, particularly in [[Haikou]].
* In [[Yanglan Village]] in the northeast, two Min dialects, both closely related to Cantonese, are spoken: the [[Mai dialect]] and the [[Danzhou dialect]], spoken in Haipo Village in the south, which is the same dialect as the dialect spoken in Danzhou in Dan Country in the northern part of the island.
* The [[Li people|Li]], [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] and [[Ong-Be language|Limgao]] speak [[Tai–Kadai languages]].
* The [[Miao people|Miao]] speak [[Hmong–Mien]] languages.
* There are roughly 4,500 [[Utsul]] people living in the villages of [[Yanglan]] ({{lang|zh-hans|羊栏}}) and [[Huixin]] ({{lang|zh|回新}}), two villages on the outskirts of Sanya. They speak the [[Tsat language]], a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] [[Chamic languages]].

==== Sociolinguistics ====
Standard Mandarin serves as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' between different ethnic groups. Adults who are members of a minority also have quite high literacy skills in Chinese. Most adults speak several Chinese dialects, and some also speak [[Li language|Li]].

When Chams interact with the Hainanese dialect speakers from within Hainan Province, they use the Hainanese dialect, though youngsters generally use Mandarin. Not many can communicate in Li, so the Hainanese dialect or Mandarin is often used.

In the market place and within the Sanya Municipality, the Cham speakers use Cham among themselves, and with others mostly use the Hainanese dialect. However, in the market places near the government seat of Yanglan Township, the Chams either use the Hainanese dialect or the Mai dialect.<ref name="Thurgood 2006">Thurgood, Graham.

===Life expectancy and longevity===
The people of Hainan live longer than those on the mainland. At the end of 2017, there were 1,565 [[centenarian]]s in Hainan. For every 100,000 people in the province, 17.13 were centenarians. As of 8 March 2018, there were 287,700 residents over 80 years of age, making up 3.15% of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-11/30/c_137641618.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202070445/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-11/30/c_137641618.htm|archive-date=2 December 2018|title=More than 1,500 centenarians live in south China's Hainan – Xinhua &#124; English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:“朱庐执刲”银印.JPG|thumb|[[Han dynasty]] seal unearthed in Hainan in 1984]]
[[File:“朱庐执刲”银印 阴刻.JPG|thumb|Han seal text: "Zhulu zhikui" – Zhuya commandery was abolished in 46 BC and reorganized as Zhulu county under [[Hepu Commandery]]]]

Even while Hainan Island was a part of [[Guangdong]] it had a considerable amount of local autonomy; the southern half of the island was an [[autonomous prefecture]]. Hainan's elevation to provincial level in 1988 increased its [[accountability]] to the [[Central People's Government]], but by designating the new province a [[Special economic zones of China|special economic zone]] the central government expressed its intent to allow Hainan maximum flexibility in devising programs to facilitate [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and [[economic growth]]. Administratively, the province has been divided into five economic major districts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Hainan|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The politics of Hainan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The [[Governor of Hainan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Hainan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hainan [[Chinese Communist Party]] Provincial Committee Secretary or [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|CCP Party Chief]]. The current Hainan Party Chief is [[Shen Xiaoming]].

===Legislation===
On 13 April 1988, the First Session of the Seventh [[National People's Congress]] decided to establish Hainan Province, and at the same time granted the Hainan Provincial People's Congress and its Standing Committee special legislative power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/2018-04/08/c_1122651375.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409083147/http://www.xinhuanet.com/2018-04/08/c_1122651375.htm|archive-date=9 April 2018|title = 海南用好特区立法权为发展"保驾护航"-新华网}}</ref>
After the 2019 free trade port plan is proposed, Hainan can enact legislation in economic, cultural, local affairs, social management, etc., and implement it in the Hainan Free Trade Zone (port).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hainan.gov.cn/zxtadata-8903.html |title=关于完善扩大海南特区立法权、促进海南自贸区（港）建设的提案 |access-date=16 February 2021 |archive-date=16 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210916223327/https://www.hainan.gov.cn/zxtadata-8903.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Intelligence===
Per the research conducted by [[Information Warfare Monitor]], Hainan is the physical location of [[GhostNet]]. The Chinese government has officially denied the existence of a cyber war and intelligence operations anywhere on the island.

===Administrative===
In the official [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] territorial claim, Hainan Province includes not just one island, but also some two hundred [[South China Sea Islands]]. While the containment of the South China Sea Islands means that Hainan Province has a very large water body, it has a disproportionally small land area. [[James Shoal]] ({{lang|zh-hans|曾母暗沙}}, Zēngmǔ Ànshā), which is presently marked by the PRC, signifies the country's southernmost border. But [[Malaysia]] also claims that it is on their continental shelf.

===Subdivisions===
{{main|List of administrative divisions of Hainan|List of township-level divisions of Hainan}}
Hainan Province uses a slightly different administrative system than the other [[provinces of China]]. Most other provinces are divided entirely into [[Prefectures of the People's Republic of China|prefecture]]-level divisions, each of which is then divided entirely into [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county]]-level divisions. County-level divisions generally do not come directly under the province. In Hainan, nearly all county-level divisions (the eight districts excepted) come directly under the province. This method of division is due to Hainan's relatively sparse population, totaling 9.26 million as of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2018/indexch.htm|script-title=zh:中国统计年鉴—2018|website=www.stats.gov.cn|access-date=10 August 2019|archive-date=3 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210403021245/http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2018/indexch.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Military base===
{{Main|People's Liberation Army Navy}}
Hainan Island is home to the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[Hainan Submarine Base]] and strategic [[nuclear submarine]] [[Yulin Naval Base|naval harbor]] at [[Yalong Bay]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/china-builds-secret-nuclear-submarine-base-in-south-china-sea|title=China Builds Secret Nuclear Submarine Base in South China Sea|date=2 May 2008|publisher=[[FoxNews.com]]|access-date=3 May 2009|archive-date=24 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524084717/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,353961,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The naval base is estimated to be {{convert|60|ft|m}} high, built into hillsides around a military base. The caverns are capable of hiding up to 20 nuclear submarines from [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]]s. The harbor houses nuclear ballistic missile submarines and is large enough to accommodate [[aircraft carrier]]s. The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] has estimated that China will have five [[type 094 submarine]]s operational by 2010 with each capable of carrying 12 [[JL-2|JL-2 ballistic missiles]]. Two {{convert|950|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} piers and three smaller ones would be enough to accommodate two [[carrier strike group]]s or [[amphibious assault ship]]s.

Hainan's economy is predominantly agricultural, and more than a half of the island's exports are agricultural products. Hainan's elevation to province-level status (1988), however, was accompanied by its designation as China's largest "[[special economic zone]]", the intent being to hasten the development of the island's plentiful resources. Prior to this, the province had a reputation for being a "[[Wild West]]" area, largely untouched by [[industrialisation|industrialization]]; even today there are relatively few [[factories]] in the province. [[Tourism]] plays an important part of Hainan's economy, thanks largely to its tropical beaches and lush forests. The central government has encouraged foreign investment in Hainan and has allowed the island to rely to a large extent on market forces.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 December 2017 |script-title=zh:海南省人民政府关于扩大对外开放积极利用外资的实施意见 <!--2017年12月6日 琼府〔2017〕93号--> |url=http://xxgk.hainan.gov.cn/hi/HI0101/201712/t20171214_2500764.htm |publisher=Hainan People's Government |access-date=18 April 2018 |archive-date=9 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309190845/http://xxgk.hainan.gov.cn/hi/HI0101/201712/t20171214_2500764.htm }} or [http://www.hainan.gov.cn/hn/yw/zwdt/tj/201712/t20171217_2502515.html hainan.gov]{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Hainan's industrial development largely has been limited to the processing of its mineral and agricultural products, particularly [[rubber]] and [[iron ore]]. Since the 1950s, machinery, farm equipment, and [[textiles]] have been manufactured in the [[Haikou]] area for local consumption. A major constraint on industrial expansion has been an inadequate supply of [[electricity]]. Much of the island's generating capacity is [[hydroelectric]], and it is subject to seasonal fluctuations in stream and river flows.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:海南岛综合开发计划(摘要) |url=http://www.hnszw.org.cn/data/news/2011/09/50401/ |website=hnszw.org |date=30 September 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In December 2009, the government of China announced that it plans to establish Hainan as an "international tourist destination" by 2020.<ref name="thechinaperspective1">{{cite web |url=http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hainan-province/ |title=Hainan Province: Economic News and Statistics for Hainan's Economy |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |access-date=12 November 2011 |archive-date=24 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324220402/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hainan-province/ }}</ref> This announcement contributed to a surge in the province's economy, with a year-on-year increase in investment of 136.9% in the first three months of 2010. Hainan's real estate sector accounted for more than one third of the province's economic growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-05/10/content_9829683.htm |title=Hainan officials rule out bubble burst |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=10 May 2010 |access-date=9 August 2010 |archive-date=4 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804075556/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-05/10/content_9829683.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the Statistical Communiqué of National Economic and Social Development of the statistical authority, the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] of Hainan Province in 2017 was 446.3 billion [[Renminbi|yuan]] (66.1 billion [[United States dollar|US dollars]]), up by 7.0 percent over the previous year. Of this total, the [[value added]] of the primary industry was 97.9 billion yuan (14.5 billion US dollars), up by 3.6 percent, that of the secondary industry was 99.7 billion yuan (14.8 billion US dollars), up by 2.7 percent and that of the tertiary industry was 248.6 billion yuan (36.8 billion US dollars), up by 10.2 percent. The value added of the primary industry accounted for 21.95 percent of the GDP; that of the secondary industry accounted for 22.34 percent; and that of the tertiary industry accounted for 55.71 percent.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Near Xinlong, Hainan - 02.JPG|thumb|right|One of the many rice fields in Hainan]]
Owing to Hainan's tropical climate, [[paddy rice]] is cultivated extensively in the northeastern lowlands and in the southern mountain valleys.<ref name="thechinaperspective1"/> Leading crops other than rice include [[coconut]], [[palm oil]], [[sisal]], [[tropical fruit]]s (including [[pineapple]]s, of which Hainan is China's leading producer), [[black pepper]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[cashews]], and [[sugarcane]].

The hot [[Hainan yellow lantern chili]], a variety similar to the scotch bonnet, is unique to the island, and is grown in the southeast and southwest.

The total tropical crop area of Hainan is 100,000 hectares.<ref name="marketwatch.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ceis-hsf-release-xinhua-hsf-price-indices-in-s-china-haikou-2018-04-23|title=CEIS, HSF release Xinhua HSF Price Indices in S.

Hainan is a major rubber producer. In the early 20th century [[overseas Chinese|Chinese emigrants]] returning from then [[British Malaya]], introduced [[rubber tree]]s to the island; after 1950, state farms were developed, and Hainan now produces a substantial amount of China's rubber. Natural rubber is now grown on 246,000 hectares of land. This ranks 6th in the world in harvest area and 5th in terms of output.<ref name="marketwatch.com"/>

Hainan has almost 93,000 hectares of [[Areca catechu|areca palm]]s. The product, the [[areca nut]], is consumed locally and also sent to the mainland. Ninety-five percent of China's production of this nut is produced in Hainan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/global/2019-04/05/content_37455633.htm|title=Public health warning a tough nut to crack – Chinadaily.com.cn|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=26 July 2020|archive-date=15 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215195023/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/global/2019-04/05/content_37455633.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Domesticated farm animals comprise mainly goats, cows, water buffalo, chickens, geese and ducks.

====Fisheries====
[[File:Fish farms in Chengmai - 01.jpg|thumbnail|[[Fish farm]]s in [[Chengmai]]]]
Grouper, Spanish mackerel, and tuna{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} constitute the bulk of the catch from offshore fishing grounds. Scallops and pearls are raised in shallow bays and basins for local use and export.

Shrimp production is estimated to have been {{convert|120000|to|150000|MT|ST}} in 2007, more than 50% of which was exported. Hainan has over 400 [[shrimp farm|hatcheries]], most being located between Wenchang and Qionghai.

[[Tilapia]] production in 2008 was {{convert|300000|MT|ST}}. The island has an estimated 100,000 local, commercial fish farming families.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euchinawto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=314&Itemid=36 |title=Sustainable Aquaculture in South China – Shrimp and Tilapia Farming in Hainan and Guangdong Provinces |publisher=Euchinawto.org |access-date=12 November 2011 |archive-date=7 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807203456/http://www.euchinawto.org/index_php.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=314&Itemid=36 }}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:HainanSanya4.jpg|thumb|right|Located in Sanya, this beach is typical of those along the entire eastern coast of Hainan]]
Hainan Island is often divided into eight regions for tourism purposes: Haikou and area (Haikou, [[Qiongshan]], [[Ding'an County|Ding'an]]); the Northeast ([[Wenchang]]); the Central East Coast (Qionghai, Ding'an); the South East Coast; the South (Sanya); the West Coast also called the [[Chinese Riviera]] (Ledong, Dongfang, Xianghsui, Changjiang); the North West ([[Danzhou]], Lingao, Chengmai); and the Central Highlands (Baisha, Qiongzhong, and Wuzhishan/Tongzha).

====Historical sites====
{{main|Major national historical and cultural sites (Hainan)}}
Haikou is the province's capital and contains interesting historic sites. Also known as Coconut City, Haikou is a major port. The [[Five Officials Temple]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|五|公|祠}}|p=Wǔgōng cí}}, {{Coord|20|0|35.79|N|110|21|17.34|E|type:landmark_region:CN-46|display=i}}) consists of five traditional temples and halls that were built in honor of five officials of the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) dynasties. These officials were banished to Hainan for periods ranging from 11 days to 11 years for speaking out against what they felt were wrong practices by the emperors. (It is perhaps significant that the establishment of the Five Officials Temple in the late 19th century coincides with a time when China's territorial integrity was under threat, and that several of the officials honored here were exiled for espousing aggressive policies on the recapture of the north of China from the [[Jurchens]] during the Southern [[Song dynasty]].)

[[Xiuying Fort]] was built in 1891 to defend the southeastern corner of China during the [[Sino-French War]]. The Xiuying Fort Barbette covers about a third of an acre. Its five large cannons are still intact and viewable at the site.

[[File:Hai Rui tomb 01.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Hai Rui]]]]
The Tomb of [[Hai Rui]] ({{Coord|20|0|29.66|N|110|17|30.18|E|type:landmark_region:CN-46|display=i}}) is a key national cultural protection site. [[Hai Rui]] was a compassionate and popular official of Hainanese origins who lived during the Ming dynasty. He was famous for his lifelong honesty and his willingness to speak out on behalf of local people. In later life, Hai Rui was persecuted and fell out of favor with the emperor. His admirers built the Hai Rui Tomb after his death to commemorate his great works. Construction of the tomb began in 1589.

The [[Yangpu Ancient Salt Field]] is a heritage site in Yantian village on [[Yangpu Peninsula]]. The area comprises more than 1,000 stones, cut flat on top, used to dry seawater to produce salt.

====Other attractions and destinations====

==Transport==

===Road===
Before 1950 there were practically no transport links with the interior of the island. The first roads were built in the early 20th century, but no major road construction was undertaken in the mountains until the 1950s. Parallel north–south roads along the east and west coasts and through the interior of the island constitute most of Hainan's road network.

Hainan is the only province in China that does not have highway toll stations. This is due to the 1994 "fee-to-tax" reform.<ref name="xinhuanet.com" /> Instead, road maintenance costs are raised through a 60% tax on fuel.<ref>{{Cite web|date=10 December 1998|title=Road taxes|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/265369/road-taxes|access-date=12 February 2022|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref>

There are several major highways and expressways linking Haikou on the north coast with Sanya on the south coast. The [[China National Highway 224|G224]] is 309 kilometers long and runs through the middle of the province. The Hainan Ring Highway has three parts: The [[China National Highway 225|G225]] is {{convert|429|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} long and is the western part. For most of its length, the G225 runs parallel to the [[Hainan western ring railway]]. The [[China National Highway 223|G223]] is the eastern part, running from Haikou to Sanya. It is 323 kilometers long. The [[G98 Hainan Island Ring Expressway|G98]] is a 612.8-kilometer-long orbital expressway that encircles the island. [[Hainan Highway 1]], a new 1,040-km-long scenic highway, will be built around the island, along the coast starting in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201903/13/WS5c88c7c4a3106c65c34ee715.html|title=New highway lets tourists drive around Hainan Island – Chinadaily.com.cn|website=global.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=26 July 2020|archive-date=15 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215194817/https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201903/13/WS5c88c7c4a3106c65c34ee715.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

There are also numerous rural roads within the province. These are typically two-way asphalt roads and connect larger towns. Connecting the thousands of villages to one another and to farms, are concrete roads about 6 meters wide. Many of these were built from roughly from the year 2000 onward, and as of 2019, are still being built.

===Bridges===

While a bridge connecting Hainan to the Leizhou peninsula on the mainland was planned in the early 2000s it never came to fruition. A bridge or tunnel received continued consideration in 2018, as travel by air or ferry can leave residents and visitors isolated when bad weather sets in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chinaplus.cri.cn/news/china/9/20180223/94355.html|title=Hainan travel chaos: Is it time to build the cross-strait subsea tunnel?|date=8 June 2018|access-date=8 June 2018|archive-date=15 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215194801/http://chinaplus.cri.cn/news/china/9/20180223/94355.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Province-wide infrastructure development====
From 2015 to the present, a widespread program to improve cities and other settlements in Hainan island has been taking place. It includes the removal of litter from towns, villages, and many roadsides. [[Illegal dumping|Small, illegal dumps]] are being removed. However, [[illegal dumping]] of [[construction waste|construction debris]] still occurs on rural roads. Large, plastic dumpsters have been put in place within villages and at countryside road intersections. Towns are being improved with new road and sidewalk surfaces, landscaping features are being created, and many buildings are receiving new façades.

This [[Haikou#Massive city-improvement campaign|initiative in Haikou]] has seen entire neighborhoods demolished and rebuilt, sanitation improved, illegal structures used for business removed, roadside vendors banned, roads and sidewalks replaced, and new street crossings with traffic lights installed.

==Settlement==
[[File:Hainan Museum 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hainan Museum|Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]
As a frontier region celebrated by such exiled poets as [[Su Shi|Su Dongpo]], Hainan acquired an air of mystery and romance. The influx of large numbers of mainlanders after 1950 – particularly in the 1970s, when young Chinese from southern Guangdong were assigned to state farms to help develop Hainan, and in the 1980s, when thousands more came to take advantage of the economic opportunities offered – has perpetuated the frontier atmosphere on the island.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

In the late 1960s, the influx of [[sent-down youth]]s (primarily from Guangdong) to Hainan island led to the use of the phrase, "being rooted in Hainan" to refer to commitment to the revolutionary cause.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Rodriguez |first=Sarah Mellors |url= |title=Reproductive realities in modern China: birth control and abortion, 1911–2021 |date=2023 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-009-02733-5 |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |page=152 |oclc=1366057905}}</ref> By the early 1970s, the meaning of the phrase had evolved to refer to getting married and starting a family on the island.<ref name=":0" />

==Media==
As well as programs from [[Central China Television]] (CCTV), Hainan has a number of local TV stations including [[Hainan Television|Hainan TV]] and [[Haikou Television|Haikou TV]]. The Chinese language ''[[Nanguo Metropolis Daily]]'', ''[[Haikou Evening News]]'', and ''[[Hainan Daily]]'' newspapers are published in Haikou.

A large film studio is located in the south part of Haikou. [[Movie Town Haikou]] comprises several studio buildings and an artificial town used as filming sets and a visitor attraction.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Typical Hainan lunch - 01.jpg|thumb|right|Common dishes served in Hainan]]
{{Main|Hainan cuisine}}
Hainan cuisine is said to be "lighter, with mild seasonings." A lot of local taste is mixed with the Han Chinese taste. Seafood predominates the menu, as shrimp, crab, fish and other sea life are widely available.

[[Wenchang chicken]] is a dish known throughout the province of Hainan. Although there are many varieties of this dish, the name is usually used to define a type of small, free-range chicken from [[Wenchang]], located on the east coast of the province. As opposed to [[Battery cage|battery]] chickens, its meat has more texture and is somewhat drier.

[[Hainanese chicken rice|Hainan chicken rice / Coibui]] is a famous dish in Southeast Asia, particularly [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]],  bearing the region's name. However, while many restaurants use chicken fat to quickly add flavor to the dish, the proper local method is to 'marinate' the rice with chicken soup to add a more full flavor.

==Events==
Numerous events are hosted or sponsored on the island, including:
* [[Blue Bay LPGA]] – Women's Golf [[LPGA]] tournament, held annually at Jian Lake Blue Bay Golf Course
* Swatch Girls World Pro China – Annual Elite Women's surfing competition, held at [[Wanning]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.swatchgirlspro.com/en/china/2013/home|title = Swatch Girls World Pro China|archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131214061620/http%3A//www.swatchgirlspro.com/en/china/2013/home|archive-date = 14 December 2013}}</ref>

==Miscellaneous topics==
*The novel, ''[[Red Detachment of Women (ballet)|Red Detachment of Women]]'', by [[Liang Xin]], was set in Hainan. The novel was first adapted to a feature film in the 1950s, and then a ballet in the 1960s as one of the [[Eight model plays]]. Most of the people of that time derived their romanticized image of Hainan Island from the scenes in the ballet, particularly that of the vivid forests of coconut trees, the Five Finger Mountain ([[Wuzhi Shan]]), and the [[Wanquan River]].
*Two notable lighthouses are located on Hainan: the [[Baishamen Lighthouse]] and [[Mulantou Lighthouse]] are among the tallest in the world, the latter being the tallest in China.
*[[3024 Hainan]], named after the province, is an [[Outer asteroid belt|outer main-belt]] [[asteroid]] discovered in 1981.

===Space center===
{{main|Wenchang Space Launch Site}}
One of China's satellite launch centers is located in Hainan east of the city of [[Wenchang]]. The [[Wenchang Space Launch Site]], a {{convert|1200|ha|acre}} facility, is the closest Chinese launch center to the equator. The construction plan was first announced in October 2007. The new launch center began operations on 25 June 2016 with the [[Long March 7]] rocket making its [[maiden flight]].

==Notable residents==
The poet [[Su Shi]] (1036–1101) popularized Hainan's isolation and exoticism when he was exiled there under the [[Song dynasty]]. The [[Dongpo Academy]] was built on the site of the residence where he lived in exile.

[[Hai Rui]] (1514–1587) was a famous Chinese official of the [[Ming dynasty]]. His name has come down in history as a model of honesty and integrity in office.

[[Chih-Ping Chen]] (1906–1983) was a distinguished diplomat and statesman for the Republic of China, who served to build the Yunnan-Burma Road, and a diplomatic career that spanned four decades.

The most well-known native of Hainan is Chinese businessman, [[Charlie Soong]], father of the [[Shanghai]]-born [[Soong sisters]]: [[Soong Ai-ling]], wife of [[H. H. Kung]] (once China's richest man); [[Soong Ching-ling]], wife of [[Sun Yat-Sen]]; and [[Soong Mei-ling]], wife of former [[Republic of China|ROC]] President [[Chiang Kai-shek]].
