{{nihongo|'''Kure'''|呉市|Kure-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Hiroshima Prefecture]], Japan. {{As of|2023|04|30}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 208,024 in 106,616 households and a [[population density]] of 590 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Kure-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.kure.lg.jp/soshiki/54/people.html|title= Kure city official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{convert|352.80|sqkm|sqmi}}. With a strong industrial and naval heritage, Kure hosts the second-oldest naval [[dockyard]] in Japan and remains an important base for the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force]].

== History ==
The area of Kure is part of ancient [[Aki Province]], and the port of Kure was an important seaport for [[Hiroshima Domain]] in the [[Edo period]].

The [[Kure Naval District]] was first established in 1889, leading to the construction of the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] and the rapid growth of steel production and shipbuilding in the city. Kure was formally incorporated on October 1, 1902. From 1889 until the end of the [[Pacific War]], the city served as the headquarters of the [[Kure Naval District]].

Kure dockyards recorded a number of significant engineering firsts including the launching of the first major domestically built capital ship, the battlecruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tsukuba||2}} (1905)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=David|title=Kaigun:Strategy, Tactics and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887-1941|date=1997|publisher=First Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=978-0-87021-192-8|page=159}}</ref> and the launching of the largest battleship ever built, the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} (1940).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=William|title=The Pacific Campaign in World War II: From Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-70175-4|page=17}}</ref>

During the Pacific War, Kure acted as the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s single-largest naval base and arsenal. Most of the city's industry and workforce were employed in the service of the naval installations, munitions factories and associated support functions. In the later stages of the conflict Kure came under sustained aerial bombardment culminating in the [[bombing of Kure]] in June and July 1945.

From February 1946 until the end of Japan's postwar occupation in 1952, military establishments in Kure served as the operational headquarters for the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]].

Since 2005, Kure has attracted attention as a tourism center with the [[Yamato Museum]] hosting a 1:10 scale model of the ''Yamato'' alongside a waterfront JMSDF museum of Japanese naval history.

The city continues as a major maritime center hosting both the dockyards of [[Japan Marine United]] and numerous shore-based facilities of the JMSDF including training centers and a major hospital. The city serves as the home port of an Escort Flotilla (Destroyers), a Submarine Flotilla and the Training Squadron of the JMSDF Regional Kure District.
