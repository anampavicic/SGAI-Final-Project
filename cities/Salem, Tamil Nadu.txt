==History==
{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2021}}

=== Early period ===
During the third century BCE, there was the period of [[Bogar]] – a notable Tamil [[Siddhar]], and at that time [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] arrived. Around the beginning of the [[common era]], the existence of a culturally and economically advanced society in Salem two thousand years ago is evident from the discovery of silver coins of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero|Tiberices Claudices Nero]] (37–68 CE) in Koneripatti of Salem in 1987. Later, the [[Pandya dynasty]] started ruling the region around Salem. Afterwards, the [[Pallava dynasty]] arose in Salem, followed by Mahendra Varma Pallava coming to Salem and the rise of [[Saivite]] principles. Mahendra Varma Pallava was succeeded by Narasimha Varma Pallava. Soon, the Pandya dynasty ruled over Salem. The Hoysala rule established in Salem and parts around Salem was retained under the Pandya dynasty.

=== Medieval period ===
The city has also been a part of the Chola Dynasty. A mosque in the city is believed to have been built by Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore Kingdom in the present-day state of Karnataka. The town and the surrounding hilly regions were part of the [[Chola dynasty]] and were part of the trade route with the [[Roman empire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Far East Kingdoms of South Asia: Cheras|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaCheras.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217112250/http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaCheras.htm|archive-date=17 February 2017|access-date=25 February 2017|work=The History Files}}</ref> It was later governed by [[Poligars]], who built temples and forts in and around the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=E.
