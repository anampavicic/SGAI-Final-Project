== Etymology ==
During the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' period in ancient India, a king named Rewat had a daughter named Rewati. The father used to call her Rewa, and founded a village "Rewa Wadi" named after her. ''Wadi'' and ''wada'' mean a neighbourhood (small and big, respectively) in Hindi and many other Indian languages. When Rewa married [[Balram]], elder brother of [[Krishna]], the king donated the village "Rewa-Wadi" to his daughter. In the course of time, the name Rewa-Wadi became Rewari.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rewari.gov.in/history/ | title=History &#124; District Rewari, Government of Haryana &#124; Veer Bhoomi &#124; India | access-date=8 April 2023 | archive-date=8 April 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408092207/https://rewari.gov.in/history/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
===Medieval===
[[File:Maharaja Hemu Bhargava - Victor of Twenty Two Pitched Battles, 1910s.jpg|Hemchandra (Hemu) Vikramaditya in a poster of a {{Circa|1910s}} book on him|thumb]]
[[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]] was educated and brought up in what is now Rewari. Hem Chandra had developed a cannon foundry in Rewari, laying the foundation of a metalwork industry in brass, copper sheets. He had supplied cannons and gunpowder to [[Sher Shah Suri]] from 1535 onwards and was an adviser to the last ruler of Sur dynasty until 1553, Adil Shah Suri, when he became Prime Minister and Chief of Army. Hem Chandra had won 22 battles from [[Punjab]] to [[Delhi]] during 1553–56. He defeated Mughal king [[Akbar]]'s forces at Agra and Delhi. Hem Chandra was crowned as a Vikramaditya king at [[Purana Quila]] in Delhi on 7 October 1556, reigned as king of Delhi for one month but lost to [[Akbar]] on 5 November 1556 at Panipat where he died. His haveli (house) still stands in the Qutubpur area of the city, which in his day was a village in its own right. His two-story haveli, with carved sandstone doorway, is made of local stone from Aravalli range, brunt-mud lakhori bricks and lime mortar. Walls are plastered with lime and painted with limewash. Roof has lakhouri bricks and stone slabs rested on timer beams. Doors and niches have stone lintels or brick arches in the local regional architecture. Over-hanging roof chhajja has stone brackets to anchor the stones. Akbar made Rewari a sarkar under Delhi Suba. Aurangzeb attacked and recovered it from the rebels. Mughhals granted the local rule to Nand Ram, Ahir leader of Bolni village in 17th century which lasted up to 19th century. A small Ahir principality was established there in the early century and ruled over the surrounding Ahirwal area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

 Than facing fearful odds,<br/>	
 For the ashes of his fathers,<br/>	
 And temples of his gods.

Built in 1893, it was the only loco shed in [[North India]] for a long time and a part of the track connecting Delhi with [[Peshawar]].<ref name=bl>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-10/delhi/28274419_1_steam-engine-rewari-locomotive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106050445/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-10/delhi/28274419_1_steam-engine-rewari-locomotive|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 November 2012|title=Eye on Games, black beauties gather steam|date=10 August 2010|location=India|first1=Dwaipayan|work=[[The Times of India]]|last1=Ghosh}}</ref> After steam engines were phased out by 1990, the loco shed remained in neglect for many years before it was decided by Indian [[Railways]] in December 2002 to revive it as a heritage museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/archieve/lreleng/lyr2002/rdec2002/02122002/r0212200218.html|title=National Conference on Steam Heritage Tourism inaugurated|date=2 December 2002|publisher=Ministry of Railways|access-date=5 October 2010|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064145/http://pib.nic.in/archieve/lreleng/lyr2002/rdec2002/02122002/r0212200218.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The shed was refurbished as a [[heritage tourism]] destination, its heritage edifice was restored and a museum exhibiting Victorian-era artefacts used on the Indian rail network, along with the old signalling system, gramophones and seats was added.

[[File:Rewari Junction Railway Station.JPG|thumb|right|Rewari Railway Station]]
Rewari was first connected by a railway line in 1873 when the first [[metre gauge]] railway track in India became operational. This track was laid between [[Delhi Junction railway station|Delhi]] and Ajmer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history2.html|title=IR History: Early Days - II - Chronology of railways in India, Part 2 (1870 - 1899) |quote=World's first commercial MG service runs from Delhi to Rewari |website=irfca.org |access-date=7 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213191919/https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history2.html |archive-date=13 December 2004}}</ref> The gauge was converted to {{Track gauge|5ft6in|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]] in 1995 for one of the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history5.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: IR History: Part 5|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=9 January 2020|archive-date=9 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309122643/https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history5.html|url-status=live}}</ref> This allowed metre gauge trains from Rajasthan to continue up to [[Sarai Rohilla Railway Station|Delhi Sarai Rohilla]] station on the remaining track.

[[Rewari railway station|Rewari]] is a major junction on the [[Indian Railways|Indian railway]] network and is connected to the major cities of India by direct trains. Six railway lines branch out from it to Delhi, [[Ajmer]] via [[Narnaul]] and [[Ringas]], Ajmer via [[Alwar]], [[Loharu]] via [[Kanina khas|Kanina]], [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]] and [[Jhajjar]]-[[Rohtak]]. The latest sixth single-track line to [[Jhajjar]] and [[Rohtak]] was constructed in 2008–12 and commissioned in January 2013. A seventh double-track line starts from Khori near Rewari to Asaoti near [[Palwal]] for facilitating carriage of goods on [[Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India|Western Dedicated Freight Corridor]]. "New Rewari" railway station has been built on this dedicated freight railway line. A line branches off from New Rewari station, goes over Rewari-Narnaul and Rewari-Kanina-Mahendragarh tracks to join the Rewari-[[Bhiwani]] railway line 2&nbsp;km after the Rewari junction, thus bypassing the Rewari junction. This obviates the need for goods trains on Western Dedicated Freight Corridor to pass through Rewari junction for going towards [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Rewari-Delhi double railway track was electrified in 2018. Rewari has electrified tracks on the Jaipur-Alwar-Rewari-[[Bhiwani]]-[[Hisar (city)|Hisar]] and Rewari-[[Narnaul]]-[[Ringas]]-[[Phulera]] routes. These tracks have a high catenary with 7.45&nbsp;m high OHE for double-stack containers. The electrical locomotives on these tracks will have a special pantograph for the high catenary. Electric trains (EMU) may run between Delhi and Rewari in future. Rewari-Alwar-[[Bandikui]] and Rewari-Bhiwani routes became double tracks in 2019.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

A new railway line Rapid Regional Transit System (RRTS) is being constructed from Nizamuddin station in New Delhi to Alwar via Gurgaon-Manesar-Dharuhera-Rewari-Bawal-Shahjanpur. A loop of this RRTS will have a railway station east of Rewari at village Majra Gurdas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amarujala.com/delhi-ncr/noida/111537033818-noida-news | title=अरावली में अंडरग्राउंड गुजरेगी रैपिड रेल | access-date=7 October 2018 | archive-date=7 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007185300/https://www.amarujala.com/delhi-ncr/noida/111537033818-noida-news | url-status=live }}</ref>

===By Road===
Rewari is connected by five national highways: 
* [[National Highway 48 (India)|NH 48]] (former name NH 8 before [[List of National Highways in India by highway number|renumbering]] of all national highways) (Delhi-Jaipur-[[Bombay]]-[[Pune]]-[[Bangalore]]).
* [[National Highway 11 (India)|NH 11]] (starting from [[National Highway 352 (India)|NH 352]] off Delhi-Jaipur NH 48 and going to [[Narnaul]]-[[Jhunjhunu]]-[[Bikaner]]-[[Jaisalmer]]).
* [[National Highway 352 (India)|NH 352]] (former name NH 71) (Rewari-[[Jhajjar]]-[[Rohtak]]-[[Jind]]-[[Narwana]]).
* [[National Highway 919 (India)|NH 919]] (former name NH 71B) (Rewari-[[Dharuhera]]-[[Sohna]]-[[Palwal]]). 
* [[National Highway 352W (India)|NH 352W]] (former name [[State Highway 26 (Haryana)|SH-26)]] (Rewari-[[Pataudi]]-[[Gurgaon]]).

Before NH 48 was built in early 1960s, the Rewari-Gurgaon travel was via Dharuhera-[[Bhiwadi]]-[[Taoru]]-Sohna. NH 919 was a state highway before it was declared NH a decade ago; NH 352 was newly constructed in 2011–13; and NH 11 was declared to start from Rewari only three years ago and a 4-lane Rewari-Narnaul bypass on NH 11 from east of Rewari city (starting at NH 352 just off NH 48) to west of Rewari city (at Khori railway station) has been constructed in 2021-23 to bypass the city.

State highways connect Rewari to all major towns in Haryana and adjacent districts of Rajasthan.
* SH-24 Rewari-Kanina-Mahendragarh-Loharu 92&nbsp;km. (It may be converted to NH and become a part of Rewari-Kanina-Mahendragarh-Tosham-Hisar.)
* SH-15 Shahjahanpur-Rewari 21&nbsp;km.
* [[State Highway 26 (Haryana)|SH-26)]] Gurgaon-[[Pataudi]]-Rewari 52&nbsp;km.

The two-lane SH-26 was declared a national highway, NH352W, in 2018 and is being widened to four-lane to provide an alternative to NH 48. It will be ready in early 2024. The new alignment of NH 352W will join [[Dwarka Expressway]] (NH 248-BB) and provide fast connectivity of just one hour duration from Rewari to Palam airport and Delhi bypassing congested NH 48 in [[Gurgaon]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurugram-pataudi-rewari-highway-to-be-ready-in-a-year/articleshow/95926860.cms | title=Gurugram-Pataudi-Rewari highway to be ready in a year | newspaper=The Times of India | date=2 December 2022 | access-date=1 April 2023 | archive-date=1 April 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401144334/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurugram-pataudi-rewari-highway-to-be-ready-in-a-year/articleshow/95926860.cms | url-status=live }}</ref>

A road bridge is being constructed on SH-15 at Rewari Anaj Mandi and the road will be widened to 4 lanes.

There are frequent bus services between Rewari and Delhi, as well as other towns of [[Haryana]], [[Punjab]] and [[Rajasthan]].

==Education==
[[File:Govt. School for Boys, Rewari.jpg|thumb|Govt. School for Boys, Rewari, established in 1890. One of the oldest schools in Haryana]]
Rewari has one university, ten-degree colleges, two BEd colleges, 110 secondary / higher secondary schools, one industrial training institute and one footwear training institute. Government Higher Secondary School was started in the year 1887. Hindu High School was started by the [[Bhargava]] community in 1890 in the building now known as Bhargava Boarding House located near Bhadawas Gate. The nearest college was in the nearby princely state of [[Alwar]] until independence. Ahir College was set up in 1945 by Rao Balbir Singh, a descendant of Rao Tularam. Kishanlal Public College is another educational institute. Shishu Shala was the first English school, established in 1950 in Model Town.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

A [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]] (Central School) has existed in Rewari city since 1980. A [[Sainik School]] was started in 2008, temporarily housed in Rewari city awaiting completion of construction of its permanent campus at village Gothra Tappa Khori, about 15&nbsp;km southwest Rewari-Narnaul Road.

The Meerpur centre of Rohtak University was upgraded to a [[Indira Gandhi University, Rewari|university]] in 2013. It is a [[state university (India)|state university]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Marks mess at varsity |url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/marks-mess-at-varsity-48198 |access-date=18 July 2022 |work=Tribune |date=28 February 2020 |archive-date=18 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220718125755/https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/editorials/marks-mess-at-varsity-48198 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Several private colleges have been set up around Rewari in the last decade to teach engineering, management, law, and nursing though the quality of education in some of them is low as in the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmindia.nic.in/speech/content.asp?id=555 |title=PM's address at the 150th Anniversary Function of University of Mumbai |author=Prime Minister Manmohan Singh |access-date=18 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112072640/http://pmindia.nic.in/speech/content.asp?id=555 |archive-date=12 January 2012 }}</ref>
