== Etymology ==
The name Taunggyi means "huge mountain" in the Burmese language, and is named after the ridge on the east of the city, part of the [[Shan Hills]] system, whose prominent high point is called ''Taung-chun'' or "The Spur." Locally this spur is popularly known as ''Phaya Taung''. The ridge has a more prominent and more popular feature known as ''Chauk Talone'', meaning the ''Craigs''.

== History ==
Prior to [[British rule in Burma|British colonisation]], Taunggyi was a small [[Pa'O people|Pa'O]] village of a few huts and the majority of Shan ethnic. The area lay on a wide shoulder of the [[Sittaung Hills]] of the [[Shan Hills]] and was populated by those ethnicities at the time. The signs of the original village of Taunggyi are long gone, but nearby villages can still be discerned quite easily.

During British occupation, the town became the chief city and capital of the Southern Shan States. Taunggyi's modern development began in 1894, when the British moved their administrative offices from [[Maing Thauk]] (Fort Stedman) on the eastern shores of Inle Lake to the higher elevation of Taunggyi, for health and geographical reasons. Although geographically within the state of [[Yawnghwe]], the town was denoted as a "notified area" by the British, exempt from the [[Sawbwa]]'s administration.  By 1906, there existed a thousand houses. Because of civil unrest throughout the Shan States during the early 1900s, Taunggyi served as the chief garrison for military police. Taunggyi also served as a supply centre for the Shan States, and catered to persons of many nationalities.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Taung-gyi|volume=26|pages=452–453}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:3 Taunggyi (2).jpg|left|thumb|307x307px|Taunggyi city in 1961]]
Taunggyi is at an elevation of {{convert|4712|ft}} above sea level.  It sits on a high intermontaine basin (erroneously called a plateau) that rapidly descends to the western lowland river valleys that make up central Myanmar, but is otherwise surrounded by mountain range.
The city is {{convert|635|km|mi}} from Yangon (Rangoun) by road.

===Climate===

Taunggyi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa''), closely bordering a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb''). There is a winter dry season (December–March) and a summer wet-season (April–November). Temperatures are very warm throughout the year; the winter months (December–February) are milder but the nights can be quite cool.

==Transportation==
The main access to Taunggyi is by the mountainous road.  A railway line that passes through Taunggyi was recently built in 1995, but at the moment{{when|date=May 2019}} it offers no passenger service to Taunggyi. Regular railway passenger service to the rest of the country is through the town of Shwenyaung, {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the west.  The nearest airport is [[Heho Airport]], {{convert|24|mi|abbr=on}} about an hour driving distance, by road to the west of Taunggyi. Heho Airport has regular flights to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]] and [[Bagan]].

==Culture==

[[File:Taunggyi Chinese temple.jpg|thumb|The Guan Yin Buddhist Monastery (''Kwan Yin Si Hpaya Kyaung'') in Taunggyi serves the local Chinese community.]]
[[File:St. Josephs Cathedral Taunggyi.jpeg|thumb|St. Joseph's Cathedral in Taunggyi serves as the headquarters of the [[Archdiocese of Taunggyi]].]]
[[File:Taunggyi St.George Anglican Church.jpg|thumb|St.George Anglican Church]]
Taunggyi is the melting pot for the [[Myelat]] area of the Shan State. Like in most of Myanmar, influence of Buddhism is most evidenced by the monasteries scattered throughout the city.  However, being a relatively new city, the monasteries are not of historical significance and architecturally not unique.  There is also a significant Christian population, as the center of the Roman Catholic [[Archdiocese of Taunggyi]] the St. Joseph's Cathedral and its associated seminary are the main facilities, as well as a Baptist church. Both churches were established by early missionaries.  There is also a smaller [[Anglican church]], which originally served the British administrators, but recently it has fallen into a state of disrepair.  Four [[mosque]]s serve the Muslim communities of the city. Among four mosques, Panthay mosque serves the Chinese [[Panthay]] Muslims mainly. The other mosques are for large population of [[Burmese Muslims]].  There are also a few temples serving the Chinese Buddhist community. After 1990s, Chinese migrants are settling in Taunggyi and now they constitute the considerable proportion in communities.

The Taunggyi celebration of the [[Tazaungdaing Festival]], a national holiday marking the end of the rainy season, has achieved international notoriety for pyrotechnic rockets involved in the [[Taunggyi Hot Air Balloon Festival]].<ref>"Taunggyi's fire balloon festival".

Being the capital of the Shan State, Taunggyi hosts many government offices. The city also hosts Eastern Command of the [[Tatmadaw]] (Myanmar military) and it occupies a significant portion of the north-east area of the city. [[Shan State Cultural Museum]] lies in Taunggyi. The museum displays the Shan culture, as well as items of historical interest, such as the belongings of [[Sawbwas|Sawbwa]].

== Economy ==

=== Tourism ===
The Taunggyi area is a popular tourist destination.  The city itself has an interesting [[five-day market]], where farmers from around the area would come to the Taunggyi on market day and sell fresh produce in the open market, but with more development of the city, the significance of market day has been lessened.  However, the market-day tradition continues strong in the outlying small towns.  Nearby, [[Inle Lake]] is the home of the unique [[Intha people|Intha culture]].  Inlay is famous for its traditional crafts industry and [[floating market]]s that are accessible via traditional longboats. The most unique thing is that Intha row the boat with their leg. On the way to the [[Pindaya Caves]] provides visitors with a good view of the Myelat countryside. Near Taunggyi, in Kekku, there are hundreds of stupas which dates back to 16th century.

=== Industry ===
There is no significant industry in Taunggyi.  It used to be the trans-shipment point for many of the agricultural products of southern Shan State.  However, due to recently imposed zoning regulations, most of these operations have been moved to the surrounding new town of [[Aye Thar Yar|Ayetharyar]].

=== Agriculture ===

Another economy of Taunggyi is farming and gardening. Farmers around Taunggyi are mostly Shan and Pa-O ethnic origins. The main agricultural products of Taunggyi are potatoes, tea leaf, tomato, beans, damson and seasonal fruits.

== Education ==
The city is home to:
* [[Taunggyi University]] 
* University of Computer Studies, Taunggyi
* [[University of Medicine, Taunggyi]] 
* [[Technological University, Taunggyi]]
* [[Taunggyi Education College]]

== Sports ==
The 7,000-seat [[Taunggyi Stadium]] is a multi-use [[stadium]] in Taunggyi. The stadium is the home ground of [[Shan United F.C.|Shan United FC]], a [[Myanmar National League]] (MNL) football club.

== Health care ==

=== Public Hospitals ===
* [[Sao San Tun]] General Hospital
* Taunggyi Women and Children Hospital
*Taunggyi University Hospital<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pyithuhluttaw.gov.mm/question-2198|title=ဦးကျော်ဝင်း ( ကန်ကြီးထောင့် မဲဆန္ဒနယ်)|website=www.pyithuhluttaw.gov.mm|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100918/https://www.pyithuhluttaw.gov.mm/question-2198|url-status=dead}}</ref>
