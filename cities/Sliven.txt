'''Sliven''' ({{langx|bg|Сливен}} {{IPA|bg|ˈslivɛn|}}) is [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|the eighth-largest city]] in [[Bulgaria]] and the administrative and industrial centre of [[Sliven Province]] and municipality in [[Northern Thrace]]. It is situated in the [[Sliven Valley]] at the foothills of the [[Balkan Mountains]].

Sliven is famous for its heroic [[Hajduk|Haiduts]] who fought against the [[Ottoman Turks]] in the 19th century and is known as the "City of the 100 [[voyvoda|Voyvodi]]", a Voyvoda being a leader of Haiduts.

The famous rocky [[massif]] [[Sinite Kamani]] (Сините камъни, "The Blue Rocks") and the associated nature park, the fresh air and the mineral springs at [[Slivenski Mineralni Bani]] offer diverse opportunities for leisure and tourism. Investors are exploring the opportunity to use the local wind (Bora) for the production of electricity.

Another point of interest and a major symbol of the city as featured on the coat of arms, is the more than thousand-year-old Stariyat Briast (Старият Бряст, "The Old Elm"), a huge [[Smooth-leaved Elm]] in the center of the city. During Ottoman rule, Turkish officials used to hang Bulgarian revolutionaries on it. Today the city is helping the tree to live on by frequent evaluations and reinforcing its base. It was elected Bulgarian tree of the year in 2013. On 19 March 2014 the results of an online poll were revealed at a ceremony in the European Parliament. The Old Elm was voted [[European Tree of the Year]] 2014. The city also served as an important strategic centre for the [[Bulgarian Army]], with the headquarters of the Bulgarian Third Army located in the centre of the city, being situated relatively near to the sensitive Turkish border.

[[Sliven Peak]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Sliven.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from the Slavic word ''sliv'' ("pour, confluence") + the Slavic suffix or ending ''-en''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sliven.gvardia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=221&Itemid=80 |title=За Сливен |publisher=БНС – Сливен |language=bg |access-date=2008-09-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928233719/http://sliven.gvardia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=221&Itemid=80 |archive-date=2008-09-28 }}</ref> In Turkish the name of the city is İslimiye, while in [[Greek language|Greek]] it is Σλίβεν.

== Geography ==
[[File:Karandila2.jpg|left|thumb|View of Sliven and the [[Upper Thracian Lowlands|lowlands of Thrace]] from southern [[Stara Planina]]]]
Sliven is situated in the [[Sliven Valley]] at the foothills of the [[Balkan Mountains]]. It is located 300&nbsp;km east of Bulgaria's capital [[Sofia]], 100&nbsp;km from [[Burgas]], the country's largest commercial port, 130&nbsp;km from the border with [[Turkey]] and 130&nbsp;km from the border with [[Greece]]. It is located in close proximity to the cities of [[Yambol]] and [[Nova Zagora]].

West of the city lies the so-called Peach Valley which contains large [[peach]] orchards. The city is also known for the mineral baths at [[Slivenski Mineralni Bani]] some 12&nbsp;km southeast, whose water is used to treat diseases of the liver and nervous system.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.tourism.government.bg/bg/spa-destinations/6497/6504 |title=Slivenski Mineralni Bani |website=Official Site of the Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=20 April 2024}}</ref>

The most visited geographical location and attraction in the city is the Karandila (Карандила). It is a hilltop 1050m above sea level, with great sights overlooking the city. The rock formation Halkata (Хaлката, "The Ring") is located on the Karandila. It is a rock protrusion with a peculiar hole in the center. According to myth, one would have their most sincere wish granted upon passing through the ring. Karandila is the site of the annual [[Sarakatsani|Karakachani]] festival, organized by the [[Federation of the Cultural and Educational Associations of Karakachans]] (ФКПДК) in Bulgaria each July.<ref>[http://www.ourbulgarianworld.info/new-forum/37-bulgarian-traditions-and-customs/13788-annual-karakachan-festival-karandila Annual Karakachan Festival, Karandila]</ref>

Karandila is located in the nature park [[Sliven Province#Nature Park Sinite Kamani - The Blue Rocks|Sinite Kamani]] (Сините камъни), whose peak Bulgarka (Българка, 1181&nbsp;m.) is the highest in the eastern Balkan mountain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bulgariainside.eu/en/articles/%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8A%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B8-%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0/467/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515032138/http://www.bulgariainside.eu/en/articles/%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8A%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B8-%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0/467/index.html |archive-date=2014-05-15 |title=BulgariaInside: online travel guide|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=Jul 20, 2022}}</ref>

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Saint-Dimitrius-church-in-Sliven.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Demetrius]] church in Sliven, built 1831]]
[[File:Hadji Dimitar.JPG|thumb|The monument of [[Hadzhi Dimitar]] in Sliven]]
Remains of the oldest settlements on the territory of Sliven date back to around 6000 BCE of the [[Neolithic]]. Ruins of a [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement dating to around 5th–3rd century BCE as well as [[Thrace|Thracian]] ceramics and [[Hellenistic]] coins have been discovered in the area of Hisarlaka — a small hill in Sliven. In antiquity it was known as ''Selymnos (Σήλυμνος in [[Greek language|Greek]])''. The area occupied by present-day Sliven has in the past been settled by the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes Asti, Kabileti and Seleti. These tribes held their independence until time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered them.

The 2nd century BCE marked the beginning of the Roman conquests of northeastern [[Thracia]]. Sliven was conquered by [[Rome]] around 72–71 BCE when the [[Thracians|Thracian]]<ref>Fol, Aleksandar. The Thracian Royal city of Kabyle. - In: Settlement Life in Ancient Thrace. IIIrd International Symposium “Cabyle”, 17–21 May 1993 Jambol. Jambol, 53-55.</ref> [[Kabile]] and later [[Greece|Greek]]<ref>An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen,2005,Index</ref> cities of [[Kabile]] and [[Sozopol|Apolonia]] are conquered. With the emergence of the [[Roman Empire]] the region of the city became part of the [[Thrace|Thracian]] province of the [[Roman Empire]].

A new stage in the city's history began around 2nd-4th century. The first written records of the settlement's name, Tuida/Suida/Tsuida date to this period. This name is most likely of [[Thracian language|Thracian]] origin. Its etymology is currently not understood. It is also mentioned by [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]], who identifies it as one of the four cities in the province of [[Haemimontus]], established as part of the [[Diocese of Thrace]] under [[Diocletian]] and also by [[Procopius of Caesarea]]. The Roman road from Anchialos (today [[Pomorie]]) along the [[Tundzha]] to [[Serdika]] was built.

In a written record from the 3rd century, the settlement was called <nowiki>''</nowiki>Tarzhishte" and most likely belonged to the territory of the city of Augusta Traiana (today [[Stara Zagora]]).

The fortress avoided the [[Gothic War (376–382)|Gothic War]], but was destroyed in the Huns' raid in the 5th century. During the reign of Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus]], it was rebuilt, which retained the previous one's plan, but was considerably fortified.

In the ancient fortress' interior and near its eastern wall, are excavated the remains of a basilica with a baptistery, which functioned in the 5th-6th centuries.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last1=Dimitrov |first1=Dimitŭr Alekseev |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893974801 |title=Khristii︠a︡nskite khramove po bŭlgarskite zemi (I-IX vek) |last2=Димитров |first2=Димитър Алексеев |date=2013 |isbn=978-954-2972-17-4 |edition=Pŭrvo izdanie |location=Sofii︠a︡ |pages=50–51 |oclc=893974801}}</ref> It was likely destroyed by the Huns and rebuilt under [[Justinian I]]. A larger church was founded in the south of the fortress, built in the 5th century and enlarged in the 6th century. This indicates that the settlement was not limited to the territory of the fortress, but also expanded in the surrounding area.<ref name=":0" />

The city of Tuida/Tsuida was the seat of a bishop, subordinate to the Metropolitanate of Adrianople. Until that time the bishop seat was in [[Cabyle]]. In the 4th century, most likely due to the proximity of the two cities, which were in different provinces, Cabyle was abandoned and its population moved to [[Yambol|Diospolis]]. The seat of the bishop, however, for unknown reasons, was moved to Tuida, which very likely marked the beginning of the proverbial rivalry between Sliven and Yambol.

Tuida ceased to exist around 598-599, when it was again destroyed, most likely by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]]. There is a theory that this happened as part of a major battle between the Avars and the Byzantine general Comentius.

=== Middle Ages ===
The area of Sliven was incorporated into the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] around 705 as part of the Slav-settled [[Zagore (region)|Zagore]], according to [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel's]] treaty with the Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian II]]. A settlement was established on the area of Tuida, of which the etymology is unknown. The beginnings of the settlement weren't dated, but were before 870, when a lead seal of [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] was discovered. The Bulgarians reconstructed the walls of the fortress and also the water supply at the northern gate. New buildings were built, some of which, have lined marble slabs made in [[Preslav]]'s stonemasonry workshops.

Paleoornithologist Zlatozar Boev discovered bone remains of 14 species of wild and domestic birds in Hissarlaka from the 10th-12th centuries. The findings of [[Hawk eagle]] ([[Aquila fasciata]]) and [[grouse]] ([[Tetrao urogallus]]) are among the rarest in the country.

The town continued to exist after the dissolution of the first empire. The Pechenegs briefly controlled it in mid-10th century, after which it began to decline. In 1153, the town was rebuilt. The fortress was abandoned and ceased.

During the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], twenty-four monasteries were built in its vicinity, which formed a complex. Under Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]], Sliven was a town near the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Димитър Ангелов, Въпросът за политическите емигранти в отношенията между Византия и средновековна България // В: Античная древность и средние века. – Вып. 10. – 1973. – С. 121.</ref> During the Ottoman invasion, the medieval town was destroyed and the monasteries were burnt. The city was known as "İslimye" by the Turks.

=== Early modern history ===
Sliven distinguished itself as a Jewish center. By 1859, 30 Jewish families lived in Sliven, where a synagogue and a Jewish school were built for them.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Raĭchevski |first1=Stoi︠a︡n. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/256501426 |title=Bŭlgari i evrei prez vekovete |last2=Райчевски |first2=Стоян. |date=2008 |publisher=Bŭlgarski bestselŭr |isbn=978-954-463-021-8 |edition=1. izd |location=Sofii︠a︡ |oclc=256501426}}</ref>

The town was the settlement of a strong [[Hajduk]] movement against the Ottomans and became known as "the town of the hundred voivodes". Among them were [[Hadzhi Dimitar]], Zlati Voivoda and [[Panayot Hitov]]. As the chief priest of the Bulgarian Militia, Amphilohiy from Sliven consecrated the Samara flag in [[Ploiești]]. 

In the 17th century Sliven developed as a crafts centre and also famous for the production of guns, pickaxes, iron tools.

During the Renaissance, Sliven emerged as an important trade, craft and cultural centre. The town was divided into residential, commercial and craft and administrative parts. Through the efforts of [[Dobri Chintulov]] and other Sliven notables, the Zora Community Centre was founded in 1860. The founder of the Bulgarian theatrical work was the Sliven-born public and cultural worker [[Sava Dobroplodni]], who wrote the first play in Bulgarian history - "Mihal Mishkoed". In 1843, the first textile industrial enterprise in the Ottoman Empire was established in Sliven, with [[Dobri Zhelyazkov]] as its head. In 1864 a second one was opened, and in 1872 tobacco and spirit factories were established.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Добри Желязков отхвърлил исляма и останал без фабрика |url=https://www.24chasa.bg/bulgaria/article/137105 |access-date=2023-01-18 |website=www.24chasa.bg |language=en}}</ref>

From the beginning of the 16th century Sliven was the centre of a [[kaza]], which retained its territory until the middle of the 19th century.

In 1738, the population of Sliven was predominantly Turkish.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Leo |first=Michel |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1062162833 |title=Bŭlgarii͡a i neĭnii͡at narod pod osmanka vlast : prez pogleda na anglosaksonskite pŭteshestvenit͡si (1586-1878) : otkrivaneto na edna narodnost |date=2013 |publisher=Tangra TanNakRa |others=Marieta Glukharova |isbn=978-954-378-106-5 |edition=1. izd |location=Sofii͡a |oclc=1062162833}}</ref> In a register from 1792, Sliven [[Sanjak]] is mentioned for the first time. Many Sliven residents participated in the [[Greek War of Independence]]. Hadzi Hristo was made a general and took the lead of the troops of Bulgarians, Albanians and Greeks, and was later elected to the Greek parliament.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Every crucial battle in the Greek War of Independence involved Bulgarians |url=http://www.grreporter.info/en/every_crucial_battle_greek_war_independence_involved_bulgarians/11010 |access-date=2023-01-18 |website=grreporter.info}}</ref> The inhabitants of the town also supported the [[Brăila]] revolt, [[Crimean War]] and participated in the [[Second Bulgarian Legion]].

During Ottoman rule it was a sanjak centre in first [[Rumelia eyalet]], then [[Silistra Eyalet|Silistre]] ([[Ochakov|Özi]]) eyalet, [[Edirne vilayet]].

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829, the troops of General [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]] entered Sliven. Continuous massacres of the Muslim population and desecration of mosques were made, involving both Bulgarian and Russian soldiers and local residents.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Doĭnov |first1=Stefan |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63519471 |title=Bŭlgarite v Ukraĭna i Moldova prez Vŭzrazhdaneto (1751-1878) |last2=Дойнов |first2=Стефан. |date=2005 |publisher=Akademichno izdatelstvo "Marin Drinov" |isbn=954-322-019-0 |edition=1. izd |location=Sofii︠a︡ |pages=86 |oclc=63519471}}</ref> The first Russian consulate was opened here in April 1830.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Doĭnov |first1=Stefan |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63519471 |title=Bŭlgarite v Ukraĭna i Moldova prez Vŭzrazhdaneto (1751-1878) |last2=Дойнов |first2=Стефан. |date=2005 |publisher=Akademichno izdatelstvo "Marin Drinov" |isbn=954-322-019-0 |edition=1. izd |location=Sofii︠a︡ |pages=101 |oclc=63519471}}</ref> After the withdrawal of the Russian troops, more than 15,000 people from the town and surrounding villages were displaced to southern Russia, Bessarabia and Wallachia, while only 2,000-3,000 Bulgarians remained in the town.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Doĭnov |first1=Stefan |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63519471 |title=Bŭlgarite v Ukraĭna i Moldova prez Vŭzrazhdaneto (1751-1878) |last2=Дойнов |first2=Стефан. |date=2005 |publisher=Akademichno izdatelstvo "Marin Drinov" |isbn=954-322-019-0 |edition=1. izd |location=Sofii︠a︡ |pages=109 |oclc=63519471}}</ref> With this, Sliven suffered a severe demographic and economic blow, which blunted the momentum of its former development.

The inhabitants of Sliven became actively involved in the national church struggle. In 1859, the people of Sliven expelled the Greek bishop, and the Diocese of Sliven entered the borders of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] established on 28 February 1870. The first spiritual leader of the diocese was Metropolitan Seraphim of Sliven.

During the [[April Uprising of 1876|April Uprising]], Sliven was the centre of the Second Revolutionary District. Battles were fought near the town during the Russo-Turkish Liberation War of 1877-1878 which in return burnt 800 shops and 100 houses in the town centre. Metropolitan Seraphim is particularly credited with saving Sliven and a number of settlements and [[Chiflik|chifliks]] in the region from complete destruction. Sliven was liberated by Russian troops on 16 January 1878.

In the 19th century, the town was a district centre and was one of the largest towns in Bulgaria with a population of over 20,000. The majority were Bulgarians.

For a short period a centre of a department in the autonomous province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] before its inclusion in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885.

=== Modern history ===
At the municipal elections in September 1911, the [[Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists)|Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party]] won the most seats, but failed to take over the municipality until August 1912, when Dr. Yordan Danchev was elected mayor. The party won elections again in 1915 and 1919. A welfare bureau, a labor bureau, and municipal housing for the homeless were established. Binding regulations were issued on relations between workers and employers on wages, on weekends and holidays. The administration was dissolved on 31 January 1923 by a decision of the [[BZNS]]-dominated Sliven District Court. 

During the [[First World War]] it was the site of the [[Sliven prisoner of war camp]], the largest such camp in the country. It was the place of internment for Greek and Serbian civilians and soldiers, with peak numbers of 19,000.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pissari |first=Milovan |date=2013 |title=Bulgarian Crimes against Civilians in Occupied Serbia during the First World War|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2013/0350-76531344357P.pdf|journal=Balcanica |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies  |issue=44 |pages=357–390 |doi=10.2298/BALC1344357P |access-date=8 May 2016|doi-access=free }}</ref>

From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Bulgaria until the beginning of the socialist economy, the industry was concentrated in the northern parts of the city.

The new government gradually began to consolidate the existing factories and built new ones, with industry concentrating around the newly built station. At some point the industrial workforce numbered 20,000, 1/2 of whom were in textile production - wool and cotton textiles. The second most important is the food industry and the third is the machine building industry (ZMM - Sliven, Dinamo Plant, etc.).

In more modern times, Sliven became one of the most significant cultural centres during the Bulgarian National Revival, with much of its old heritage still preserved and enriched and today offers to its citizens and visitors a lot of opportunities for cultural life. It served as the birthplace of many prominent Bulgarians, including [[Hadzhi Dimitar]], [[Dobri Chintulov]], [[Ivan Seliminski]]. Another notable native is [[Anton Pann]] who composed the [[Romania]]n national anthem. Another notable resident is [[Yordan Letchkov]], whose goal in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] eliminated defending champion Germany. Letchkov was mayor of Sliven from 2003 to 2011.

== Politics ==
Mayors from [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] have been in charge of Sliven Municipality in the period 1990–1991, 1999–2003 and 2011–2015. For his second term (2007–2011), Yordan Letchkov was nominated by [[GERB]]. Since 2015, Stefan Radev is the mayor of Sliven Municipality. In the local elections in [[2015 Bulgarian local elections|2011]] and [[2019 Bulgarian local elections|2019]], he was nominated by GERB (he won in 2019). Hristin Petkov was mayor of the SDS from 1991 to 1995.

In the 2011 local elections, the BSP candidate (and non-member of the party) General Kolyo Milev won in the second round with 52.94% of the votes counted against the GERB candidate (also non-member) Yordan Letchkov.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-01-03 |title=Избор на кмет и общински съвет :: Избори 2011 |url=http://results.cik.bg/tur2/mestni/2127.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103001158/http://results.cik.bg/tur2/mestni/2127.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-01-03 |access-date=2023-01-18 }}</ref>

Since 2015, the mayor of Sliven has been Stefan Radev, nominated by PP GERB (2015 and 2019), re-elected with 64.75% in the second round of local elections in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Резултати :: Местни избори 27 октомври 2019 |url=https://results.cik.bg/mi2019/tur2/rezultati/2020.html |access-date=2023-01-18 |website=results.cik.bg}}</ref> On 11 November 2019, he officially took office.

== Economy ==
The economy of Sliven has centered around industry since the early 19th century. In 1834, [[Dobri Zhelyazkov]] established the first factory in Bulgarian lands, thus starting industrial development in Bulgaria. Sliven was one of the largest industrial centers in Bulgaria, playing an important role during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. It has long-lived traditions in textiles, machine-building, glass-making, chemical production, and the technical and food industries.

Following the beginning of communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944, most industries were nationalized and much industrial building and development was spurred. Industry continued to develop until the fall of communism, at which point much of the previously built industry stagnated; many plants and factories were shut down and there was little development.

In contemporary times, Sliven has experienced a surge in economy with increased investment, banking establishments and new industries have begun to emerge. The dairy industry, which has long been present, continues to grow and thrive. The wine industry, with companies such as [[Bulgarian wine|Vinprom]] and Vini Sliven and about a dozen others, continues to grow as grapes are easily grown due to the climate conditions. In terms of heavy industry, the city produces electric lights and electrical machines. The city has also become notorious as a source of young girls who are trafficked into the sex industry.

Light industry in Sliven is mostly devoted to textiles with many companies making wool clothing, socks, and food.

In 2024, it was reported that a gang based in Sliven had been receiving up to £200 million annually in fraudulent welfare payments from the British government.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bolton |first=Will |date=2024-05-28 |title=The Bulgarian town that boomed from UK’s biggest benefits fraud |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/28/bulgarian-town-boomed-from-uks-biggest-benefits-fraud/ |access-date=2024-05-29 |work=The Telegraph |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}</ref>
