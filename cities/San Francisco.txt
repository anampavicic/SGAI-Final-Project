== Etymology ==
{{see also|List of San Francisco placename etymologies}}
San Francisco, which is Spanish for "Saint Francis," takes its name from [[Mission San Francisco de Asís]], which in turn was named after [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]]. The mission received its name in 1776, when it was founded by the Spanish under the leadership of Padre [[Francisco Palóu]]. The city has officially been known as San Francisco since 1847, when [[Washington Allon Bartlett]], then serving as [[List of pre-statehood mayors of San Francisco|the city's alcalde]], renamed it from [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (Spanish for "Good Herb"), which had been name used throughout the Spanish and Mexican eras since approximately 1776. The name Yerba Buena continues to be used in locations in the city, such as on [[Yerba Buena Island]] and in the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]] and [[Yerba Buena Gardens]].

While people residing outside the San Francisco Bay Area use nicknames including "Frisco" and "San Fran", local residents in the Bay Area sometimes refer to San Francisco as "the City" or "SF".<ref name="TBI20130630"/><ref name="is-it-ever-ok">{{cite web |last1=Brinklow |first1=Adam |title=Is it ever okay to use "San Fran?" |url=https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/26/16936872/san-fran-frisco-survey-nickname-francisco |website=Curbed SF |access-date=February 17, 2020 |language=en |date=January 26, 2018}}</ref> The choice of nickname a person uses is a common way for locals to distinguish long-time residents from tourists and recent arrivals.

===Spanish era===
[[File:Victor Adam after Louis Choris - Vue du Presidio san Francisco, 1822 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Juan Bautista de Anza]] established the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] for the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1776.]]
[[File:Mission San Francisco de Asís (Oriana Day) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mission San Francisco de Asís]] was founded by Padre [[Francisco Palóu]] on October 9, 1776.]]
The [[Spanish Empire]] claimed San Francisco as part of [[Las Californias]], a province of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. The Spanish first arrived in what is now San Francisco on November 2, 1769, when the [[Portolá expedition]] led by Don [[Gaspar de Portolá]] and [[Juan Crespí]] arrived at [[San Francisco Bay]]. Having noted the strategic benefits of the area due to its large natural harbor, the Spanish dispatched [[Pedro Fages]] in 1770 to find a more direct route to the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] from [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], which would become part of the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] route. By 1774, [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] had arrived to the area to select the sites for a [[Spanish missions in California|mission]] and [[presidios of California|presidio]]. The first European maritime presence in San Francisco Bay occurred on August 5, 1775, when the Spanish ship [[San Carlos (1768 ship)|''San Carlos'']], commanded by [[Juan Manuel de Ayala]], became the first ship to anchor in the bay.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Raup|first1=H.

Soon after, on March 28, 1776, Anza established the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. On October 9, [[Mission San Francisco de Asís]], also known as Mission Dolores, was founded by Padre [[Francisco Palóu]].<ref name="DeAnza-Moraga-Palou"/> In 1794, the Presidio established the [[Fort Point National Historic Site|Castillo de San Joaquín]], a fortification on the southern side of the [[Golden Gate]], which later came to be known as Fort Point.

In 1804, the province of [[Alta California]] was created, which included [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], which was the former name of San Francisco. At its peak in 1810–1820, the average population at the Mission Dolores settlement was about 1,100 people.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cleary |first=Brother Guire |url=http://www.catholic-sf.org/013103.html |title=Mission Dolores Links San Francisco with its 18th Century Roots – Founded as La Mission San Francisco De Asis by Franciscans, it survived earthquake and fire |work=Catholic San Francisco |date=January 31, 2003 |access-date=March 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205190950/http://catholic-sf.org/013103.html |archive-date=February 5, 2007 }}</ref>

In 1821, the [[The Californias|Californias]] were [[Mexican War of Independence|ceded to Mexico]] by Spain. The extensive [[missions in California|California mission system]] gradually lost its influence during the period of [[First Mexican Republic|Mexican rule]]. Agricultural land became largely privatized as [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]], as was occurring in other parts of California. Coastal trade increased, including a half-dozen [[barques]] from various Atlantic ports which regularly sailed in California waters.<ref name="From 1820 to the Gold Rush">[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/early.html "From 1820 to the Gold Rush"], at San Francisco Museum.org, accessed 2022.06.03.</ref><ref>Cf., Richard Henry Dana Jr., ''[[Two Years before the Mast]]'' (1840).</ref>

[[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (after a native herb), a trading post with settlements between the Presidio and Mission grew up around the ''Plaza de Yerba Buena''. The plaza was later renamed [[Portsmouth Square]] (now located in the city's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] and [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]]). The Presidio was commanded in 1833 by Captain [[Mariano&nbsp;G. Vallejo]].<ref name="From 1820 to the Gold Rush"/>

In 1833, [[Juana Briones de Miranda]] built her [[ranchos of California|rancho]] near [[El Polín Spring]], founding the first civilian household in San Francisco, which had previously only been comprised by the military settlement at the Presidio and the religious settlement at Mission Dolores.<ref name="Briones de Miranda"/>

In 1834, [[Francisco de Haro]] became the first [[Alcalde]] of Yerba Buena. De Haro was a native of Mexico, from that nation's west coast city of [[Compostela, Nayarit]]. A land survey of Yerba Buena was made by the Swiss immigrant [[Jean Jacques Vioget]] as prelude to the city plan. The second Alcalde [[José Joaquín Estudillo]] was a [[Californio]] from a prominent [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] family. In 1835, while in office, he approved the first land grant in Yerba Buena: to [[William A. Richardson|William Richardson]], a naturalized Mexican citizen of English birth. Richardson had arrived in San Francisco aboard a [[whaler|whaling ship]] in 1822. In 1825, he married Maria Antonia Martinez, eldest daughter of the Californio [[Ygnacio Martínez]].<ref name="Richardson">{{cite web

Following the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] in Sonoma and the beginning of the [[Conquest of California|U.S. Conquest of California]], American forces under the command of [[John B. Montgomery]] captured Yerba Buena on July 9, 1846, with little resistance from the local Californio population. At the end of the month, the ''[[Voyage of the Brooklyn Saints|Brooklyn]]'' arrived with a group of Mormon settlers, who had departed New York City six months earlier. Following the capture, U.S. forces appointed both [[José de Jesús Noé]] and [[Washington Allon Bartlett]] to serve as co-[[alcalde]]s (mayors), while the conquest continued on in the rest of California. Following the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, [[Alta California]] was [[Mexican Cession|ceded from Mexico to the United States]].

The discovery of silver deposits, notably the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further fueled rapid population growth and economic expansion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wiley |first=Peter Booth |title=National trust guide- San Francisco: America's guide for architecture and history travelers |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-471-19120-9 |location=New York |pages=31–33 |oclc=44313415}}</ref>

San Francisco, as the gateway to the goldfields, experienced a surge in population and commercial activity. However, the influx of fortune seekers also brought challenges. Lawlessness was rampant, and the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco|Barbary Coast]] district became synonymous with vice, attracting criminals, prostitutes, and illicit activities, including but not limited to prostitution, [[Rum-running|bootlegging]], and gambling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wiley |first=Peter Booth |title=National trust guide- San Francisco: America's guide for architecture and history travelers |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-471-19120-9 |location=New York |pages=237–238 |oclc=44313415}}</ref> The rapidly growing population, with its lawlessness, gambling and other vices, and the fact that there were no churches to be found, prompted missionaries like [[William Taylor (missionary)|William Taylor]] to come  to San Francisco where he began preaching in the streets, using an upright barrel as his pulpit. Taylor was able to garner enough generous donations from successful gold miners with which he used to build a church.<ref>[[#taylor1895|Taylor, 1895]], p. 195</ref>

One of the most influential figures of this era was [[William Chapman Ralston]]. A shrewd banker and investor, Ralston amassed considerable wealth and influence in San Francisco. He gained control over a significant portion of the [[Comstock Lode]]'s gold and silver mines, establishing a virtual monopoly. Using his incredible clout, Ralston was able to generate millions of dollars for San Francisco during its heady boom years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=William Ralston - FoundSF |url=https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=William_Ralston |access-date=2024-08-08 |website=www.foundsf.org}}</ref> He founded the [[Bank of California]], the first bank in the Western United States, and built the opulent Palace Hotel, a symbol of San Francisco's newfound prosperity and the largest hotel in the country at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Calic |first=Dan |date=2024-01-05 |title=Blog: How The Mighty Fall.

The bond issue was objected to by the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors, however, and they were not delivered to the WPRR and CPRR until 1865 after Writs of Mandamus ordering such were issued by the Supreme Court of the State of California in 1864 (''"The People of the State of California on the relation of the Central Pacific Railroad Company vs. Henry P.

==Geography==
[[File:San Francisco Peninsula by Sentinel-2, 2019-03-11 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Satellite view of San Francisco]]
San Francisco is located on the [[West Coast of the United States]], at the north end of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and [[San Francisco Bay]] within its boundaries. Several picturesque [[islands of San Francisco Bay|islands]]—[[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], [[Treasure Island, San Francisco|Treasure Island]] and the adjacent [[Yerba Buena Island]], and small portions of [[Alameda (island)|Alameda Island]], [[Red Rock Island]], and [[Angel Island, California|Angel Island]]<!--Alameda island is capitalized correctly; "island" is not part of the proper noun and is used here to distinguish the island from the [[municipality]], which also includes of Bay Farm Island, Balena Bay, Coast Guard Island, etc. -->—are part of the city. Also included are the uninhabited [[Farallon Islands]], {{convert|27|mi|km}} offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a "seven-by-seven-mile square," a common local colloquialism referring to the city's shape, though its total area, including water, is nearly {{convert|232|sqmi|km2}}.

There are more than 50 hills within the city limits.<ref name=peak_experience>{{cite news

The nearby [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are responsible for much earthquake activity, although neither physically passes through the city itself. The San Andreas Fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989. Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis. The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city's infrastructure development. The city constructed an [[San Francisco Fire Department Auxiliary Water Supply System|auxiliary water supply system]] and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes, requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction.<ref>{{cite news

San Francisco's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Entire neighborhoods such as the [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina]], [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]], and [[Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunters Point]], as well as large sections of the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]], sit on areas of [[Land reclamation|landfill]]. Treasure Island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from the excavation of the [[Yerba Buena Tunnel]] through [[Yerba Buena Island]] during the construction of the Bay Bridge. Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes. The resulting [[soil liquefaction]] causes extensive damage to property built upon it, as was evidenced in the Marina district during the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web

In the southeast quadrant of the city is the [[Mission District]]—populated in the 19th century by [[Californios]] and working-class immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Scandinavia. In the 1910s, a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and, in the 1950s, immigrants from [[Mexican American|Mexico]] began to predominate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qualityoflife-themovie.com/website/mission.html |title=Quality of Life (film website) |work=Mission District History |author=Morgan, Benjamin (Director) |year=2007 |access-date=July 25, 2010}}</ref> In recent years, gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino, to [[Twentysomething (term)|twenty-something]] professionals. [[Noe Valley, San Francisco|Noe Valley]] to the southwest and [[Bernal Heights, San Francisco|Bernal Heights]] to the south are both increasingly popular among young families with children. East of the Mission is the [[Potrero Hill]] neighborhood, a mostly residential neighborhood that features sweeping views of downtown San Francisco. West of the Mission, the area historically known as [[Eureka Valley, San Francisco|Eureka Valley]], now popularly called [[The Castro, San Francisco|the Castro]], was once a working-class Scandinavian and Irish area.

The [[Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview-Hunters Point]] in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods, though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and [[urban renewal]] projects.

The construction of the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]] in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar, hastening the development of [[West Portal, San Francisco|West Portal]], and nearby affluent [[Forest Hill, San Francisco|Forest Hill]] and [[St. Francis Wood, San Francisco|St. Francis Wood]]. Further west, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to [[Golden Gate Park]] lies the vast [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]], a large middle-class area with a predominantly Asian population.<ref>{{cite news

The northwestern quadrant of the city contains the [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond]], a mostly middle-class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park, home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many [[Russian people|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] immigrants. Together, these areas are known as [[Neighborhoods in San Francisco|The Avenues]]. These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions: the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions.

Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]], while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace.

Retrieved September 5, 2006.</ref> San Francisco's weather is strongly influenced by the [[California Current|cool currents]] of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city, and the water of [[San Francisco Bay]] to the north and east.

As part of the retrofitting of the Golden Gate Bridge and installation of a suicide barrier, starting in 2019 the railings on the west side of the pedestrian walkway were replaced with thinner, more flexible [[slat (aircraft)|slats]] in order to improve the bridge's aerodynamic tolerance of high wind to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

Interstate 280 continues south from San Francisco, and also turns to the east along the southern edge of the city, terminating just south of the Bay Bridge in the [[South of Market (San Francisco)|South of Market]] neighborhood. After the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], city leaders demolished the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] and a portion of the [[Central Freeway]], converting them into street-level boulevards.<ref name="freeway" />

Cohen writes that many credit "Friscophobia" to newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], whose first book, published in 1953, was "Don't Call it Frisco" after a 1918 newspaper article of the same name. Caen was considered by many to be the recognized authority on what was, and what was not, beneath the city's dignity, and to him, Frisco was intolerable. {{cite web
