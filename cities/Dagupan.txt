'''Dagupan''' {{IPA|tl|dɐˈgupan|}}, officially the '''City of Dagupan''' ({{langx|pag|Siyudad na Dagupan}}, {{langx|ilo|Siudad ti Dagupan}}, {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Dagupan}}), is a 1st class [[Cities in the Philippines|independent component city]]<ref name="pangasinan.gov.ph">{{Cite web |url=http://pangasinan.gov.ph/the-province/cities-and-municipalities/dagupan-city/ |title=Dagupan City |website=Official Website of the Province of Pangasinan and its People |access-date=January 28, 2017 |archive-date=June 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627065017/http://pangasinan.gov.ph/the-province/cities-and-municipalities/dagupan-city/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> in the [[Ilocos Region]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 174,302 people.{{PH census|current}}

Located on [[Lingayen Gulf]] on the northwest-central part of [[Luzon]], Dagupan is a major commercial and financial center north of [[Manila]]. Also, the city is one of the centers of modern medical services, education, media and communication in North-Central Luzon. The [[National Economic and Development Authority|NEDA]]-Regional Development Council officially establishes Dagupan as a regional center.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ilocos.neda.gov.ph/page/9/ |title=RDC-1 Approves NLGC Strategic Plan, Ilocos Development Report and Resolutions for Socio-Economic Growth in Region 1}}</ref>
The city is situated within the fertile [[Agno River]] Valley and is in turn a part of the larger [[Central Luzon]] plain. 

The city is among the top producers of [[milkfish]] (locally known as ''bangus'') in the province. From 2001 to 2003, Dagupan's milkfish production totaled to 35,560.1 metric tons (MT), contributing 16.8 percent to the total provincial production. Of its total production in the past three years, 78.5 percent grew in fish pens/cages while the rest grew in [[brackish water]] [[fish pond|fishponds]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru1/dagupan_feature.htm |title=Dagupan City: The Home of the World's Longest Barbecue |website=National Statistical Coordination Board |access-date=May 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726121322/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru1/dagupan_feature.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2014}}</ref>

Dagupan is administratively and politically independent from the provincial government of Pangasinan and is only represented by the province's legislative district. And also, it is the second most-populous city in that province and in Ilocos Region after [[San Carlos, Pangasinan|San Carlos City]].

Dagupan is one of the proposed metropolitan area in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wowdagupantoday.blogspot.com/2011/01/new-metropolis-rising-in-pangasinan.html |title=New Metropolis Rising in Pangasinan |date=January 7, 2011 |website=Wow Dagupan Today |quote=Dagupan Metropolitan Area or Metro Dagupan (DMA) is a metropolitan area in north central Luzon.}}</ref> Metro Dagupan is proposed to include the independent component city of Dagupan, as well as the towns of [[Binmaley, Pangasinan|Binmaley]], [[Calasiao]], [[Lingayen]], [[Manaoag, Pangasinan|Manaoag]], [[Mangaldan, Pangasinan|Mangaldan]], [[Mapandan, Pangasinan|Mapandan]], [[San Fabian, Pangasinan|San Fabian]], [[San Jacinto, Pangasinan|San Jacinto]], and [[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan|Santa Barbara]].

== Etymology ==
The city's name was derived from the local [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] word ''pandaragupan'' which means ''gathering place'' as the city has been a [[market (place)|regional market center]] for centuries. The root word is ''dagop'', Pangasinan term of ''gather''.

== History ==

=== Caboloan ===
{{See also|Caboloan}}

During the 15th century, Pangasinan had been the site of an ancient polity called the [[Caboloan]] (kingdom of Pangasinan), which sent emissaries to China in 1406–1411.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-21-1983/scott.pdf |title=Filipinos in China in 1500 |last=Scott |first=William Henry |author-link=William Henry Scott (historian) |page=8 |series=China Studies Program |publisher=De la Salle University |year=1989 |access-date=July 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724123829/http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-21-1983/scott.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Spanish period ===
The area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.philippine-islands.ph/en/dagupan_city-pangasinan-philippines.html |title=Dagupan City |website=Philippine Islands |access-date=November 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208135804/http://www.philippine-islands.ph/en/dagupan_city-pangasinan-philippines.html |archive-date=December 8, 2015 }}</ref> The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area ''Bacnotan'' which would later be incorporated into the ''[[encomienda]]'' of [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]] that was established in 1583.<ref name="PHIVOLCS-Physiographic">{{cite web |url=http://earthquake.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/1990LuzonEQ_Monograph/pp043/pp062_077.html |title=The July 16 Luzon Earthquake: Dagupan City, A Case Study |website=Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology |access-date=July 27, 2019 |quote=In 1590, the house clusters were resettled into compact communities and converted into a town named initially as Bacnotan and renamed later in 1720 as Dagupan.}}</ref>

The first long distance railroad in the Philippines connecting Manila and Dagupan was opened on November 24, 1892.

=== Japanese occupation ===
The Japanese planes bombed in Dagupan in December 1941; Dagupan was occupied by Japanese forces starting in 1942.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lindseywilliams.org/LAL_Archives/Reporter_Predicted_Japanese_Attack.htm |title=Reporter Predicted Japanese Attack |date=December 8, 1971 |website=lindseywilliams.org |access-date=November 27, 2015 |archive-date=October 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008142038/http://www.lindseywilliams.org/LAL_Archives/Reporter_Predicted_Japanese_Attack.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city also served as a wartime capital of Pangasinan.

=== Allied liberation ===
[[File:General Douglas MacArthur landing at Luzon, Philippines, 1945.jpg|thumb|General Douglas MacArthur Landing at Luzon, Philippines, 1945. "Blue Beach", Dagupan]]

On January 8–9, 1945, U.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] landed his [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|amphibious liberation force]] in the city's "Blue Beach" section in [[Bonuan Gueset]] along the shores of [[Lingayen Gulf]].<ref name="PhilStar-MacArthur">{{cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2017/01/10/1661085/macarthur-landed-dagupan-not-lingayen |title=MacArthur landed in Dagupan, not Lingayen |first1=Eva |last1=Visperas |first2=Cesar |last2=Ramirez |name-list-style=amp |date=January 10, 2017 |work=The Philippine Star |access-date=July 27, 2019 }}</ref><ref name="Time-MacArthur">{{cite magazine |url=https://time.com/3461755/life-with-macarthur-the-landing-at-luzon-the-philippines-1945/ |title=LIFE With MacArthur: The Landing at Luzon, the Philippines, 1945 |last1=Cosgrove |first1=Ben |date=November 10, 2014 |magazine=[[TIME]] |access-date=July 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118110100/http://time.com/3461755/life-with-macarthur-the-landing-at-luzon-the-philippines-1945/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 18, 2014 |language=en-us}}</ref> From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen, [[Binmaley]] and [[San Fabian, Pangasinan|San Fabian]], MacArthur's forces under General [[Walter Krueger]] together with the Philippine Commonwealth troops under the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary units were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war near [[Cabanatuan]] in the province of [[Nueva Ecija]], and in Manila's [[University of Santo Tomas]], among others.

=== Cityhood ===
{{Main|Cities of the Philippines}}

Dagupan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 170, authored by House Speaker [[Eugenio Pérez]]. It was signed into law by President [[Manuel Roxas]] on June 20, 1947.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA">{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno170.html |title=Republic Act No. 170 – An Act Creating the City of Dagupan |website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |access-date=January 31, 2016}}</ref>

=== Contemporary history ===
The westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao, which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name ''Lucao'' may have been derived from the shellfish called ''lukan'' that used to abound in the swampy area. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic church. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased substantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles and other modes of transportation.

On July 16, 1990, a [[1990 Luzon earthquake|magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon]], causing liquefaction, which made buildings tilt and sink due to their heavy weight and the looseness of the ground, which turned into sediment-rich mud. The Magsaysay Bridge, one of the two bridges especially spanning the Pantal River, collapsed, delaying people from crossing to the other banks and vice versa. Major damage caused businesses to be permanently transferred to the neighbouring towns of [[Mangaldan]] and [[Calasiao]], but somehow, Dagupan and its inhabitants managed to recover from the earthquake.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/235745/dagupan-rises-from-1990-nightmare |title=Dagupan Rises From 1990 Nightmare |first=Gabriel |last=Cardinoza |date=July 24, 2012 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}</ref>

At the turn of the millennium, seeking to promote the thriving milkfish industry that harnessed the city as the milkfish capital of the country, The Bangus Festival was formally launched in 2002 by then-Mayor Benjamin Lim. The city earned the World's Longest Barbecue record from the Guinness World Records in 2003 during the holding of the Kalutan ed Dalan where 10,000 pieces of bangus were grilled on the longest barbecue grill measuring 1,007.56 meters long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1173396 |title=Dagupan's Bangus Festival is back |first=Hilda |last=Austria |date=May 1, 2022 |website=Philippine News Agency }}</ref>

Dagupan is the economic center of [[Pangasinan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nicp.org.ph/next-cities/dagupan-city |title=Dagupan City |website=National ICT Confederation of the Philippines |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915042923/https://www.nicp.org.ph/next-cities/dagupan-city |archive-date=2017-09-15}}</ref> As a major regional hub, many people in Pangasinan and nearby provinces commute to the city during the day; this causes the city's daytime population to rise and cause traffic in parts of the city, especially the downtown area. The city is a vital financial center housing numerous banks, non-bank financial institutions, headquarters of corporations and offices of major government departments and agencies.

[[File:Milkfish (Chanos chanos) locally called 'bangus' in a Philippine market.jpg|thumb|Milkfish, locally known as ''bangus'']]

Historically, Dagupan was a center for salt making in numerous salt evaporator beds in the low-lying swampy areas close to [[Lingayen Gulf]]. Beginning in the 19th century, some of the salt making operations gave way to pond culture of fish, most prominently, the [[milkfish]] (locally known as ''bangus''), for which the city has become famous. Fisheries, [[aquaculture]] and processed fisheries products are an important mainstay of the city's economy.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258767267 |first1=Michael A. |last1=Rice |first2=Arthur Z. |last2=Devera |name-list-style=amp |title=Aquaculture in Dagupan City, Philippines |journal=World Aquaculture |volume=29 |number=1 |pages=18–24 |date=March 1998 |access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref>
