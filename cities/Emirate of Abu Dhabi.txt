In the early 1970s, two important developments influenced the status of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The first was the establishment of the United Arab Emirates in December 1971, with Abu Dhabi as its initially temporary political and administrative capital. The second was the sharp increase in oil prices following the [[Yom Kippur War]], which accompanied a change in the relationship between the oil exporting countries in the Middle East and foreign oil companies, leading to a dramatic rise in oil revenues.<ref name="Abu Dhabi Over a Half Century"/> See the [[1973 oil crisis]].

In 2023, Abu Dhabi had a nominal GDP of AED 1.02 trillion (US$277.9 billion), a nominal GDP per capita of US$84,900, and a government debt to GDP ratio of 16%.<ref name="Cullinan">{{Cite web |last=Cullinan |first=Trevor |last2=Filocca |first2=Giulia |last3=Nair |first3=Purnima |date=24 Nov 2023 |title=Emirate of Abu Dhabi 'AA/A-1+' Ratings Affirmed; Outlook Stable |url=https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3094184 |access-date=2024-02-03 |website=S&P Global Ratings}}</ref> In 2022, the size of oil and mining trade increased by 54% and accounted for 48% of GDP.

==Etymology==
Before the area got the name Abu Dhabi, it was known as ''Milh'', which means [[salt]] in Arabic, probably because of the [[salt water]] in the area. Milh is still the name of one of the islands in Abu Dhabi.<ref name="name">{{cite web |title=How did Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other cities get their names? Experts reveal all |publisher=UAE Interact |date=3 October 2007 |access-date=5 April 2013 |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/news/rss-news.asp?ID=24335 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407043402/http://www.uaeinteract.com/news/rss-news.asp?ID=24335 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |language=en}}</ref>

"Dhabi" is the Arabic name of a particular species of native gazelle, the [[Arabian gazelle]], that was once common in the Arabian region. Abu Dhabi means "the father of the Dhabi". The first use of the name goes back over 300 years. Since the origin of this name has been passed down from generation to generation through [[poem]]s and [[legend]]s, it is difficult to know the actual [[etymology]] of the name. It is thought that the name came about because of the abundance of gazelles in the area, and a popular folk tale about the founding of the city of Abu Dhabi involving Sheikh [[Shakhbut bin Dhiyab Al Nahyan]].<ref name="name"/><ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=http://www.uae-tour.com |title=United Arab Emirates |access-date=19 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721122534/http://uae-tour.com/ |archive-date=21 July 2013|url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation, the [[Bani Yas]], in the late 14th century, which also assumed control of [[Dubai]]. In the late 18th century Abu Dhabi was formed. In the early 19th century, Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9780230603493 |title=The Political Culture of Leadership in the United Arab Emirates |year=2007 |language=en |doi=10.1057/9780230603493 |last1=Rugh |first1=Andrea B. |isbn=978-1-349-53784-6 }}</ref>

The Emirate of Abu Dhabi was first established in 1540 after the fall of the [[Jabrids]] as the Emirate of Al Dhafrah. It was ruled by the [[Bani Yas]], who are originally from the [[Banu Hilal|Bani Hilal]] tribe. Their rule in Al Dhafrah was cemented by the construction of the Al Dhafrah fort in 1543. Around 1761, the tribe discovered freshwater sources on [[Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi Island]], which lead them to establish the Abu Dhabi Emirate.

From 1881 to 1893, the emirate, under [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]], was embroiled in a fierce [[Qatari–Abu Dhabi War|war]] with [[Qatar]]. This culminated in the [[Battle of Khannour]] near the village of Maza'a from January 1889 to February 1889, which extended to several regions within the emirate, including [[Liwa Oasis|Liwa]], [[Al Dhafra, Abu Dhabi|Al Dhafra]] and Al Ain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hayajneh |first1=Raed Ahmed |year=2021 |title=Khannour Battle 1889, Causes, Results, and Reactions in the Arabian Gulf: Documentary Research |url=https://digitalcommons.aaru.edu.jo/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&context=aauja |journal=Association of Arab Universities Journal for Arts |language=Arabic |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=77 |accessdate=18 July 2024}}</ref> The emirate also had several victories over [[Qatar]]. Abu Dhabi demolished the capital, Doha, twice and occupied the broader Al Hasa region after ottoman intervention. In 1893, an agreement jointly brokered by the British and Ottomans resolved the long-standing conflict between Qatar and Abu Dhabi.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Omar |first1=Ihab |date=30 May 2018 |title=خراب الدوحة... عن الخلافات القديمة بين قطر وجيرانها |url=https://raseef22.net/article/120756-%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%82 |accessdate=18 July 2024 |publisher=Raseef22 |language=Arabic}}</ref>


The Emirate at its greatest extent stretched from [[Sohar|Sohar, Oman]] to [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia]], during the wars of the 3rd & 4th Destruction of Doha where the Emirate declared war on the Ottoman Empire and Qatar over a dispute. Contrary to popular belief, the emirate & the other 6 emirates weren’t under Omani rule, instead being independent self governing emirates. The name Omani Coast refers to the emirate’s location within the historical and cultural region of Oman, and not the [[Oman|Sultanate of Muscat & Oman]].

[[Abu Dhabi]] was a base for the tribe to trade, dive for pearls, and for other maritime activities.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |date=June 2017 |title=Statistical Yearbook of Abu Dhabi 2017 |url=https://www.scad.ae/Release%20Documents/SYB_2017_EN.PDF |access-date=3 February 2024 |website=Abu Dhabi Statistics Centre |page=114}}</ref> Into the late-19th century, the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to flourish mainly by [[camel]] herding, production of [[Date Palm|date]]s and vegetables at the inland [[oasis|oases]] of Al-Ain and [[Liwa Oasis|Liwa]], and fishing and [[pearl]] diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city, which was occupied mainly during the summer months. Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were, at this time, constructed of [[Arecaceae|palm]] fronds (''barasti''), with the wealthier families occupying [[Mudbrick|mud huts]]. These businesses were very profitable and a strong source of income for the local Dhabyanis, until [[Cultured pearl|cultured pearls]] were invented in the early 19th century in Japan which caused the pearl trade to crash.<ref name=":12">{{cite web |title=United Arab Emirates {{!}} History, Culture, Population, Map, & Capital |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Arab-Emirates |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210814055742/https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Arab-Emirates |archive-date=August 14, 2021 |access-date=2021-08-31 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}</ref> This continued until the late 1950s, when oil was discovered in the emirate & its coastlines.<ref name=":22">{{cite web |title=United Arab Emirates |url=http://www.uae-tour.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721122534/http://uae-tour.com/ |archive-date=21 July 2013 |access-date=19 April 2019 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1939, [[Sheikh]] [[Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan]] granted petroleum concessions, and oil was first found in 1958. At first, oil money had a marginal impact. A few low-rise concrete buildings were erected, and the first paved road was completed in 1961, but Sheikh Shakbut, uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last, took a cautious approach, preferring to save the revenue rather than investing it in development.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

[[File:Stamp Abu 1967 40f-170px.jpg|thumb|Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], the emir of Abu Dhabi and founder of the federation (stamp from 1967)]]
His brother, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi. The ruling Nahyan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country. On August 6, 1966, with the assistance of the British, Zayed became the new ruler.<ref>{{cite book |last=Al-Fahim |first=M. |title=From Rags to Riches: A Story of Abu Dhabi |chapter=6 |publisher=London Centre of Arab Studies |year=1995 |isbn=1-900404-00-1}}</ref>

With the announcement by the UK in 1968 that it would withdraw from the area of the [[Persian Gulf]] by 1971, Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the UAE. After the Emirates gained independence in 1971, oil wealth continued to flow to the area, and traditional mud-brick huts were rapidly replaced with banks, boutiques and modern highrises.

Land cultivation and irrigation for agriculture and forestation over the past decade has increased the size of "green" areas in the emirate to about 5% of the total land area, including parks and roadside plantations. About 1.2% of the total land area is used for agriculture. A small part of the land area is covered by mountains, containing several caves. The coastal area contains pockets of wetland and [[mangrove]] colonies. Abu Dhabi also has dozens of islands, mostly small and uninhabited, some of which have been designated as sanctuaries for wildlife.<ref>[http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/what.to.see/islands.aspx Islands of Abu Dhabi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026103353/http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/what.to.see/islands.aspx |date=October 26, 2014 }}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Temperature Abu Dhabi.JPG|thumb|Average temperatures in Abu Dhabi emirate]]
The emirate is located in the tropical dry region. The Tropic of Cancer runs through the southern part of the Emirate, giving its climate an arid nature characterised by high temperatures throughout the year, and a very hot summer. The Emirate's high summer (June to August) temperatures are associated with high relative humidity, especially in coastal areas. Abu Dhabi has warm winters with occasionally low temperatures. The air temperatures show variations between the coastal strip, the desert interior and areas of higher elevation, which together make up the topography of the Emirate.

Abu Dhabi receives scant rainfall but totals vary greatly from year to year. Seasonal northerly winds blow across the country, helping to ameliorate the weather, when they are not laden with dust, in addition to the brief moisture-laden south-easterly winds. The winds often vary between southerly, south-easterly, westerly, northerly and northwesterly. Another characteristic of the Emirate's weather is the high rate of evaporation of water due to several factors, namely high temperature, wind speed, and low rainfall.<ref name="scad.ae"/>

The [[oasis]] city of Al Ain, about {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, bordering Oman, regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country; however, the dry desert air and cooler evenings make it a traditional retreat from the intense summer heat and year-round humidity of the capital city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT002910 |title=Sharjah, United Arab Emirates |work=BBC Weather |access-date=2009-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123142007/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT002910 |archive-date=January 23, 2008 }}</ref>

The extraordinary increase in population in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi during the past half-century has made the size, structure and distribution of the population a key concern for future development.

The population of Abu Dhabi reached 1.968 million in mid-2010, with an average annual growth rate of 9.6% since 1960 - among the highest in the world. The total population has increased 99 times in 50 years. The number of citizens increased 39 times and Non-citizens 173 times in the half-century from 1960 to 2010. The most important reason behind the increase in the population growth of citizens is the increase in naturalization (before 1971, and later from other UAE emirates), while immigration constitutes the main factor in increasing the population overall.<ref name="Abu Dhabi Over a Half Century"/>

The resident population of the Abu Dhabi Emirate exceeded 2 million people in 2011. In mid-year 2011 the estimated population in Abu Dhabi Region was 1.31 million (61.8%), Al Ain Region 0.58 million (27.6%), and Al Gharbia 0.23 million (10.6%), making the total mid-year population for the Abu Dhabi Emirate 2.12 million.<ref name="SCAD">{{cite web |url=https://scad.ae/ |title=Statistics centre − Abu Dhabi |access-date=September 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923181558/http://scad.ae/ |archive-date=September 23, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In Abu Dhabi, fertility is higher than in most developed regions of the world, and mortality remains extremely low. In 2011, Crude Birth Rates and Crude Death Rates among Citizens were 15.1 births per 1,000 people and 1.4 deaths per 1,000 people respectively.<ref name="SCAD"/>

[[File:Annual rates of inflation, Abu Dhabi Emirate.JPG|thumb|Inflation rates for Abu Dhabi]]

The Emirate exported 747.2 million barrels of crude oil in 2010. Japan, the top importer, received around 35.6 per cent of the Emirate's total crude oil exports. In 2011, the Emirate exported 10.0 million metric tons of refined petroleum products, of which the Netherlands bought 16.9 per cent, followed by Japan, which purchased 13.9 per cent. One of the main oil pipelines is the [[Habshan–Fujairah oil pipeline]]. The Emirate's LNG exports increased by AED 2,973.0 million in 2011 compared with 2010, reaching AED 17,128.2 million. Japan topped the list of importers by 98.4 per cent of the LNG exports value, followed by India by 1.0 per cent in 2011. The Emirate imported 828,093.9 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2011, at a daily average of 2,268.8 million cubic feet.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The inflation rate in 2011 was 1.9 per cent. This was a result of an increase in the CPI from 119.3 points in 2010 to 121.6 points in 2011.<ref name="scad.ae"/>

The [[National Bank of Abu Dhabi]] (NBAD) is the largest lender bank in the emirate and the second-largest lender in the federation. NBAD has the largest market capitalization among UAE banks. The government has put in efforts to diversify the economy and invest in other areas such as the service and tourism industry. The capital city has seen various construction projects and the opening of shopping malls. The opening of the [[Emirates Palace]] marked the opening of the most expensive hotel ever built. The annual [[Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]] is a [[Formula One]] motor race held in the capital city, which further attracts tourists. Apart from the capital city, the [[Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge]] is held in the countryside and the tourism board is trying to highlight other places in the emirate.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The Emirate encourages major international film productions which boost employment and the economy in general. A 2019 report stated that the Film Commission provides "30% cashback on production and post-production spend in the Emirate".

==Transport==
[[File:13-08-06-abu-dhabi-airport-46.jpg|thumb|Sunrise at Zayed International Airport]]
[[Zayed International Airport]] (AUH) and [[Al Ain International Airport]] (AAN) serve the emirate. The older AUH airport was at Al Bateen Airport. The local time is [[GMT]] + 4 hours. Private vehicles, rideshares and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city, although public buses, run by the [[Abu Dhabi Municipality]], are available, mostly used by the lower-income population. There are bus routes to nearby towns such as Baniyas, Habashan and the garden city of the UAE, Al-Ain, among others. There is a newer service started in 2005 between Abu Dhabi and the commercial city of [[Dubai]] (about {{convert|150|km|mile|abbr=on}} away). The government is planning to build a railway in Abu Dhabi.{{Citation needed|date=November 2024}}

==Education==
All private and public schools in the emirate come under the authority of the [[Abu Dhabi Education Council]], while other emirates continue to work under the Federal Ministry of Education. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}
