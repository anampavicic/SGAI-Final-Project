Situated along the [[Bay of Bengal]], Kakinada is one of the largest ports in Andhra Pradesh and holds historical significance as a major port city. It was the most populous city in Andhra according to the 1911 and 1931 Censuses. It was once the starting point of the [[Buckingham Canal]] during [[British Raj|British rule]]. Known for its well-planned layout, Kakinada is also an educational hub, featuring prominent institutions such as [[Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada|Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University]] (JNTU), [[Rangaraya Medical College]], the [[Indian Institute of Foreign Trade]] (IIFT) campus, and Andhra Polytechnic. Kakinada is also a gateway to the scenic [[Konaseema]] region and is located near the [[Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary]], home to one of India's largest [[Mangrove forest|mangrove forests]]. [[Hope Island (India)|Hope Island]], situated off the coast, acts as a natural barrier protecting the city from cyclones and the effects of tsunamis, and is a popular tourist destination.

Kakinada's economy is mainly driven by industries, agriculture, and fishing. Key sectors include fertilizer production, automobile components, edible oil refineries, and natural gas extraction. The strategic Kakinada Port acts as a natural harbour, boosting the export of seafood and agricultural products. The city also has industries in information technology and power generation and is a significant hub for fertilizer and petrochemical companies in the [[Krishna Godavari Basin|Krishna-Godavari Basin]].

The city is renowned for its distinctive [[Kakinada Kaaja|Kakinada Kaja]] sweet, along with local snacks such as Bajji. Kakinada is also culturally and politically significant. The city is known for its unique Godavari dialect of Telugu and has been home to several Telugu film personalities. It is one of the three [[smart city|smart cities]] in the state under the [[Smart Cities Mission]].<ref>{{cite web |date=28 January 2016 |title=Govt. announces list of first 20 smart cities under 'Smart Cities Mission' |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/list-of-first-20-smart-cities-under-smart-cities-mission/article8162775.ece |website=The Hindu}}</ref> In the past, many residents of Andhra migrated from this seaport to countries such as [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]] and various [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian]] nations for work, where they were referred to as "[[Telugu diaspora|Coranghees]]."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Satyanarayana |first=Adapa |date=2008 |title=Telugu Diaspora in South East/West Asia, 1871-1990 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44147252 |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=69 |pages=904–914 |jstor=44147252 |issn=2249-1937}}</ref>Additionally, the city holds a geographic distinction, as the [[Indian Standard Time]] (IST) longitude passes through it.{{TOC limit|3}}

== Etymology ==
Kakinada, previously known as Kaki Nandiwada, has various theories regarding its name. It was a [[Dutch India|Dutch]] settlement,<ref>{{Cite web |last=srinivas |first=vadrevu |date=24 November 2015 |title=Dutch building in Kakinada cries for attention |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/151124/nation-current-affairs/article/dutch-building-kakinada-cries-attention |website=Deccan Chronicle}}</ref> and one belief is that the name "Cocanada" originated from the Telugu word "Koka" or "Coca," referring to [[Sari|saree]] products stored and exported by the Dutch.<ref name="city_desc">{{Cite web |last=Kumar |first=V. Rishi |date=18 March 2016 |title=Kakinada: 'Pensioner's paradise' goes fishing for more |url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/kakinada-pensioners-paradise-goes-fishing-for-more/article8366177.ece |website=[[The Hindu Business Line]]}}</ref>

Another theory suggests that during British rule, the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] found the name "Cocanada" difficult to pronounce, modifying it to "Co-Canada" for convenience. The city was also called "Coringa" due to the proximity of its port to the [[Koringa River|Koringa]] river.

The British later used the name "Cocanada" when establishing the first [[Canadian Baptist Mission]] in the area. After India gained independence, the city was officially named Kakinada during 1968. Additional theories link the name to Kakasura, a mythological figure from the [[Ramayana]], or to "Kakulavada," meaning an abode of crows, due to the birds catching fish along the shore.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://kakinada.cdma.ap.gov.in/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702002241/http://kakinada.cdma.ap.gov.in/ |archive-date=2 July 2016 |access-date=13 June 2016 |website=Official website of Kakinada Municipal Corporation}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:District Collector Office building at Kakinada.jpg|thumb|District Collectorate Office, built during British rule in Kakinada|alt=|267x267px]]

During the [[Dutch India|Dutch colonization]] of the [[Coromandel Coast]], the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) established a [[trading post]] in the area known as Jaggernaickpuram (variously spelled), in present-day Kakinada. On 25 September 1734, Haji Muhammad Hussain, the Nawab of Rajamundry, granted a parwana and kaul to the Dutch, officially transferring the hamlet of "Jagernaykpalam" to the VOC for the construction of a trading lodge.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2001 |title=Numismatic Society of Bombay, Volume 23-24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFNmAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Numismatic Society of Bombay |page=99}}</ref>

The British established a [[shipbuilding]] and repair facility in the area in 1759, which they referred to as Coringa Town, located on the [[Koringa River|Coringa River]], a branch of the [[Godavari River]]. As a principal seaport on the Coromandel Coast, Coringa became a significant shipbuilding hub. In 1802, a dock was constructed to repair [[Royal Navy]] and other vessels, becoming the only wet dock between [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. The area, including Cape Cori (now known as [[Hope Island (India)|Hope Island]]), gained international recognition for its shipbuilding and repair capabilities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sankar |first1=K.N. Murali |date=20 July 2016 |title=Coringa's relic of the past |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/coringas-relic-of-the-past/article3379198.ece |access-date=24 April 2018 |work=The Hindu}}</ref>

However, the facilities suffered extensive damage from massive cyclones. A storm in 1787 caused the loss of 20,000 lives, and another storm on 9 and 10 May 1832 further devastated the area.<ref name="Coast of Golconda- Coringa Bay2">{{cite book |last1=Horsburgh |first1=James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbhAAQAAMAAJ&q=Coringa+ship+building+AND+india&pg=PA602 |title=The India Directory, Or, Directions for Sailing to and from the ..., Volume 1 |date=1841 |publisher=Wm.

This was one of the storms cited by [[Henry Piddington]] in a speech to the [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society of Bengal]] where he first used the term ‘'cyclone'’ to describe the phenomena. Following this disaster, the port never fully recovered, and homes were relocated further inland.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://knappily.com/On%20this%20day/november-25-1839-coringa-is-destroyed-by-a-cyclone/5a1971e09622cdde40a8faf9 |title=1839 Coringa destroyed by cyclone |date=25 November 2017 |publisher=Knappily Books |access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref>

By 1901, due to [[Siltation|silting]] and sand deposition in the [[estuary]], no large ships could enter the port. Shipbuilding activities had ceased by 1905, and the port was eventually closed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coringa |url=https://knappily.com/On%20this%20day/november-25-1839-coringa-is-destroyed-by-a-cyclone/5a1971e09622cdde40a8faf9 |access-date=25 April 2018 |website=Knappily Books}}</ref><ref name="Building of docks2">{{cite book |last1=Frowde |first1=Henry |url=http://scans.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/2/25/imperialgazettee11greauoft/imperialgazettee11greauoft.pdf |title=Imperial Gazeteer of India.

In 1823, during British rule, the District of Rajahmundry was created within the [[Madras Presidency]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bhaskar |first=B. V.

[[Rajahmundry]] served as the headquarters of Godavari district until 1925, when the district was bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts. Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari, while [[Eluru]] became the headquarters of West Godavari. On 4 April 2022, East Godavari district was further bifurcated, leading to the creation of [[Kakinada district]], with Kakinada as its headquarters.

=== Climate ===

Kakinada experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Aw) , characterized by hot and humid conditions throughout most of the year. The hottest period occurs in late May and early June, with maximum temperatures ranging from 38°C to 42°C (100°F to 108°F). January is the coolest month, with minimum temperatures of 18°C to 20°C (64°F to 68°F). The city receives most of its rainfall during the southwest monsoon, though it also gets significant rainfall from the northeast monsoon between mid-October and mid-December. Kakinada is frequently affected by cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal.<ref>{{Cite web |last=S.
