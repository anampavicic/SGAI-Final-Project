Evidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original [[Polynesia]]n migrants to the archipelago comes from oral histories and artifacts.

His court relocated in 1809 to what is now [[downtown Honolulu]]. The capital was moved back to [[Kailua-Kona, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]] in 1812.

In November 1794, Captain [[Butterworth Squadron|William Brown]] of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now [[Honolulu Harbor]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kuykendall |first=Ralph S. |date=June 1923 |title=A Northwest Trader at the Hawaiian Islands |page=121 |journal=[[Oregon Historical Quarterly|The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]] |jstor=20610240}}</ref> More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia.

==Climate==
Honolulu experiences a [[Semi-arid climate|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen classification]] ''BSh''), with a mostly dry summer season, due to a [[rain shadow]] effect.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Monthly weather forecast and climate Honolulu, HI|url=https://www.weather-us.com/en/hawaii-usa/honolulu-climate|publisher=Weather Atlas|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> Despite temperatures that meet the tropical threshold of all months having a mean temperature of 64.4&nbsp;°F (18.0&nbsp;°C) or higher, the city receives too little precipitation to be classified as tropical.

Temperatures vary little throughout the year, with average high temperatures of {{convert|80|–|90|°F|°C}} and average lows of {{convert|65|–|75|°F|°C}}. Nevertheless, there are slight seasons. The "winter" months from December to March can occasionally see lows fall below {{convert|64|°F|0}}, whereas the "summer" from June to September can get a limited number of hot days achieving {{convert|90|°F|0}} or higher. This occurs on an average of only 32 days annually,<ref name = NOAA/>{{efn|There have been as many as 116&nbsp;days (in 1995) that reached {{convert|90|°F|0}}, and as recently as, 2012, no days.<ref name = NOAA/> The average is comparable to Philadelphia despite being slightly warmer during the summer.}} with lows in the upper 50s °F (14–15&nbsp;°C) once or twice a year.

The annual average rainfall is {{convert|16.41|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}},<ref name = NOAA/> which mainly occurs from October through early April, with very little rainfall in the summer. However, both seasons experience a similar number of rainy days. Light showers occur in summer, while heavier rain falls during winter. Honolulu has an average of 278 sunny days and 89.2 rainy days per year.

Although the city is in the tropics, [[hurricane|hurricanes]] are quite rare. The last recorded hurricane that hit near Honolulu was Category 4 [[Hurricane Iniki]] in 1992. [[Tornado]]es are also uncommon and occur about every 15 years. [[Waterspout]]s off the coast are also uncommon, hitting about every five years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=28119&refer=&units=us |title= Weatherbase.com |publisher= Weatherbase.com |access-date= May 22, 2012 |archive-date= June 13, 2022 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220613063421/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=28119 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

===Public transport===
====Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation====
In November 2010, voters approved a charter amendment to create a [[public transit]] authority to oversee the planning, construction, operation and future extensions to Honolulu's rail system, now known as [[Skyline (Honolulu)|Skyline]]. The Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) has a 10-member board of directors, with three members appointed by the mayor, three selected by the Honolulu City Council, and the city and state transportation directors.<ref name="HART">{{cite web|url=http://www.honolulutransit.org/hart.aspx |author=Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation |author-link=Skyline (Honolulu) |title=HART – Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation |publisher=Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation |location=Honolulu |access-date=July 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422000532/http://www.honolulutransit.org/hart.aspx |archive-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref>

The opening of the first phase of the Skyline was delayed until 2023, as HART canceled the initial bids for the first nine stations, rebid the work as three packages of three stations each, and allowed more time for construction in the hope that increased competition on smaller contracts would drive down costs;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.kitv.com/news/hart-cancels-bids-for-first-9-rail-stations/27967000 |title=HART cancels bids for first 9 rail stations |newspaper=[[KITV]] |date=September 10, 2014 |access-date=November 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129163425/http://m.kitv.com/news/hart-cancels-bids-for-first-9-rail-stations/27967000 |archive-date=November 29, 2014}}</ref> initial bids ranged from $294.5&nbsp;million to $320.8&nbsp;million, far surpassing HART's budget of $184&nbsp;million.<ref>honolulutransit.org [http://www.honolulutransit.org/media/280559/20140814-weekly-eblast.pdf Honolulu Transit E-Blast (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225150532/http://www.honolulutransit.org/media/280559/20140814-weekly-eblast.pdf |date=December 25, 2014}} August 18, 2014.</ref>

====Bus====
{{Main|TheBus (Honolulu)}}

Established by former Mayor [[Frank F. Fasi]] as the replacement for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (HRT), Honolulu's [[TheBus (Honolulu)|TheBus]] system was honored in 1994–95 and 2000–01 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]] as "America's Best Transit System". TheBus operates 107 routes serving Honolulu and most major cities and towns on Oʻahu. TheBus comprises a fleet of 531 buses, and is run by the [[non-profit corporation|nonprofit corporation]] Oʻahu Transit Services in conjunction with the city Department of Transportation Services. {{As of|2006}}, Honolulu was ranked fourth for highest per-capita use of [[mass transit in the United States]].<ref name="NTD 2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/other_data_products/Top_Transit_Cities.xls |website=National Transit Database |title=Top Transit Cities 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720225645/http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/other_data_products/Top_Transit_Cities.xls |archive-date=July 20, 2010 |date=February 11, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

'''Para-transit Options'''

The island also features TheHandi-Van,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.honolulu.gov/dts/aboutus/publictransit.html|title=Public Transit|website=www.honolulu.gov|access-date=November 13, 2019|archive-date=November 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113031647/http://www.honolulu.gov/dts/aboutus/publictransit.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> for riders who require para-transit operations. To be eligible for this service, riders must meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). TheHandi-Van has a fare of $2 and is available from 4am to 1am. There is a 24-hour service within 3/4 of a mile of TheBus route 2<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.honolulu.gov/rep/site/dts/dts_docs/24hrserviceforrte2.pdf|title=Route 2}}</ref> and route 40.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.honolulu.gov/rep/site/dts/dts_docs/24hrserviceforrte40.pdf|title=Route 40}}</ref> TheHandi-Van comprises a fleet of 160 buses. The parantransit branch also runs Human Services Transportation Coordination (HSTCP), which mainly provides transportation for people with disabilities, older adults, and people with limited incomes, assisted by the Committee for Accessible Transportation (CAT). Both organizations work together to provide transportation for elderly and persons with disabilities.

====Rail====
{{Main|Skyline (Honolulu)}}

Honolulu has no [[urban rail transit]] system, though electric street railways were operated in Honolulu by the now-defunct Honolulu Rapid Transit Company before World War II. Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&year=1888 |title=Hawaii's History in 1888 – Hawaii History – 1888 |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |access-date=May 22, 2012 |archive-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604124747/http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&year=1888 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The City and County of Honolulu is constructing a {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near [[Pearl Harbor]] and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. Skyline aims to alleviate [[traffic congestion]] for West Oʻahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project has been criticized for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership. The line's first segment connects East Kapolei and Aloha Stadium and opened on June&nbsp;30, 2023.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!-- Staff writer -->|title=With new name, city hopes for a positive rebrand of Honolulu's rail project|date=June 16, 2023|work=Hawaii News Now|url=https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2023/06/16/city-announce-official-name-brand-honolulu-rail-system/|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Vantuono |first=William C. |date=June 30, 2023 |title='Skyline' Opens in Honolulu |work=Railway Age |url=https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/rapid-transit/skyline-opens-in-honolulu/ |access-date=December 23, 2023}}</ref>

====Bicycle sharing====
Since June 28, 2017, [[Bikeshare Hawaii]] administers the bicycle sharing program in Oʻahu while Secure Bike Share operates the ''Biki'' system. Most ''Biki'' stations are between Chinatown/Downtown and Diamond Head, but a 2018 expansion added stations toward the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Campus, Kapiolani Community College, Makiki, and Kalihi area.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bikeshare Hawaii | url = http://www.bikesharehawaii.org/ | access-date = August 14, 2017 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170815061101/http://www.bikesharehawaii.org/ | archive-date = August 15, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = 10 new Biki stops to be installed from Downtown to Waikiki | url = http://www.kitv.com/story/36133094/10-new-biki-stops-to-be-installed-from-downtown-to-waikiki | work = [[KITV]] | date = August 14, 2017 | access-date = August 14, 2017 | archive-date = August 14, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814233624/http://www.kitv.com/story/36133094/10-new-biki-stops-to-be-installed-from-downtown-to-waikiki | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Zielke | first = Aydee | title = Honolulu's bike share program ready to roll in summer 2015! | url = http://www.hhf.com/2014/04/02/honolulus-bikeshare-program-ready-to-roll-in-summer-2015/ | work = HHF Planners | date = April 2, 2014 | access-date = August 14, 2017 | archive-date = February 25, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225085123/http://www.hhf.com/2014/04/02/honolulus-bikeshare-program-ready-to-roll-in-summer-2015/ | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Bikeshare Hawaii selects PBSC Urban Solutions as partner to supply bikes for Honolulu | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/12/08/bikeshare-hawaii-selects-pbsc-urban-solutions-as.html | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | location=Honolulu | date=December 8, 2015}}</ref>
