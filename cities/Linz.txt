Linz originated as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort named ''Lentia'', established in the first century. The name reflects its location at a bend in the [[Danube]] ([[Celtic languages|Celtic]] root ''lentos'' = "bendable"). This strategic position on the river made it the first Roman fort in the [[Noricum]] region, protecting a vital transportation route.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Linz |first=Stadt |title=Geschichte der Stadt Linz |url=https://stadtgeschichte.linz.at/8187.php |access-date=2024-02-26 |website=Stadt Linz |language=de}}</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite web |author=Paul Hofmann |title=Letting Linz Castle cast a spell |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9B0DEED9163BF936A35757C0A961948260&scp=5 |work=The New York Times |date=5 April 1987 |access-date=2 December 2008}}</ref>

The ''[[Oeconomische Encyclopädie]]'' (also simply known as ''the Krünitz''), with the entry about Linz being written around 1800,<ref>{{cite web|title=Oeconomische Encyclopädie: Stichwortliste|url=https://www.kruenitz1.uni-trier.de/background/entries.htm}} </ref> describes the city as well built and fortified and its economy as growing, partially because of its location on the Danube and the connection to routes to Hungary and Vienna. When written, the city had a population of 16-17 thousand. Major industries were the productions of gunpowder, iron, steel, salt, firewood and predominantly, the wool industry:

A wool manufactuary, established in 1672, was the biggest in then-Austria, or rather, the [[Federal states of Austria#Historical development|Austrian states]]. It was nationalized in 1754. Plans, made in 1770, of selling it to a tradesman were canceled. Although it kept production going, its ''golden era ''was over. 

When the ''Krünitz'' entry was written, the manufactuary had a yearly revenue of 1.5 million ''Gulden'' and was generating a hundred thousand in profit and was employing around 30 thousand people.<ref>{{cite web| date=1800| first= Heinrich Gustav | last=Flörke |url=https://www.kruenitz1.uni-trier.de |title=Oeconomische Encyclopädie}}</ref>

[[Adolf Hitler]] was born in [[Braunau am Inn]] (an Austrian town near the German border) and moved to Linz during his childhood. The notorious [[Holocaust]] bureaucrat [[Adolf Eichmann]] also spent his youth in Linz. Until the end of his life, Hitler considered Linz to be his hometown.<ref>Ian Kershaw (1998) ''Hitler: 1889–1936: Hubris''. New York: Norton. pg. 15</ref> Hitler effected the founding of the Bruckner Symphony Orchestra, which began presenting concerts in autumn 1943.

Evans (2008) ''The Third Reich at War'' Penguin Books pg.579 {{ISBN|9780143116714}}</ref> 

During [[World War II]] Linz was a giant industrial complex in support of the Nazi war effort. [[Hermann Göring]] supervised the construction of the Voest complex, ultimately a gigantic construction site built by slave labour. The [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] was established to the east of Linz, but three Mauthausen sub-camps were within the Voest complex.<ref>{{cite book | author1= Raoul Bunschoten |title=Urban Flotsam: Stirring the City |publisher=010 Publishers |year=2001 |page=277 |isbn=9789064503870 }}</ref>

In 1945, immediately after the end of the Nazi dictatorship, 39 streets in Linz were renamed, but from 1946 to 1987, only two streets were renamed. However, since 1988, 17 new traffic areas were named after victims of National Socialism or resistance fighters.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

== Economy ==
[[File:Containerhafen Linz.jpg|thumb|right|The container terminal at the harbour]]
Linz is one of the main economic centres of Austria. [[Voestalpine]] is a large technology and capital goods group, founded as the "[[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]]" during World War II. It is now known for [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] technique. The former "Chemie Linz" chemical group has been split up into several companies.

The Meeting Industry Report Austria (mira) ranks Linz as the third most important destination for congresses in Austria, with a share of 7.4 percent in the total number of congresses, conferences and seminars held in Austria.<ref>{{cite web |title=LINZ AUCH IM KONGRESSBEREICH AUF ÜBERHOLSPUR |url=http://www.linztourismus.at/presse/linz-kongressbereich-erfolgreich/ |language=de |access-date=29 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705024807/http://www.linztourismus.at/presse/linz-kongressbereich-erfolgreich/ |archive-date=5 July 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Linz has more than 60 congress and event venues. With the Blue Meeting concept, the local tourism association has developed a conference format which focuses on individual needs of participants and adapts to the idea of green meetings, therefore supporting [[waste minimisation]], [[electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]], climate-neutral travel, as well as regional [[added value]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tagungshandbuch 2014 web |date=17 December 2014 |url=http://issuu.com/linz.austria/docs/tagungshandbuch_2014_web/0 |language=de |access-date=29 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Donau-Harbor ===
Furthermore, due to the fact that one of the four Donau-Harbors (Donauhäfen) in Austria is located in Linz, it constitutes an attractive location in regards to logistic and trading enterprises. Manufacturing plants can be found along the waterfront. The economic importance of Linz was founded over centuries in trade. Large industrial enterprises are still located in Linz nowadays. Important examples are the [[Voestalpine AG]].

=== Shopping ===
[[File:Landstraße 02-12 (Linz).jpg|alt=|thumb|Landstraße, Taubenmarkt]]
Thirteen shopping malls can be found in Linz, three of which are situated in the city centre. Shopping centres include: Arkade, Atrium City Center, Shopping Mall Auwiesen, Shopping Mall Biesenfeld, Shopping Mall Industriezeile, Shopping Mall Kleinmünchen, Shopping Mall Muldenstraße, EuroCenter Oed, Shopping Mall Wegscheid, Infra Center, Lentia City, Passage, and PRO-Kaufland.

According to a study by Infrapool in Oktober 2010, the Linzer Landstraße is the busiest shopping street outside of Vienna. The weekly frequency is noted between 240,500 (Monday-Saturday, 8 a.m. until 7 p.m.) and 228,400 (8 a.m. until 6 p.m.) passers-by, which is the second highest value – only in 2005 more passers-by were detected. 

=== Markets ===
There are eleven [[farmer's market]]s as well as one weekly [[flea market]], and two Christmas markets in Linz. One of these markets, the "Urfahraner Markt", takes place in spring and fall every year. Furthermore, there are annually Christmas and New Year's Markets. The aim of the market administration is to provide the population with a wide range of products, as well as operating the markets in an economical, suitable and customer oriented manner. Additionally, the annual market called "Linzer Marktfrühling" sets further accents and lures new customers with attractive offers.

[[File:Pöstlingbergbahn, nahe Tiergarten, 09.10.2016.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pöstlingbergbahn]], a part of the [[trams in Linz]]]]
[[Linz Airport]] lies about {{cvt|14|km}} southwest of the town centre, in the municipality of [[Hörsching]]. The airport can be reached easily via federal highways B139 and B1. The bus line 601 connects the airport within 20 minutes with the centre of Linz. There is also a free shuttle service from Hörsching railway station. Direct flights include [[Frankfurt]], [[Düsseldorf]] and Vienna with additional seasonal routes added during the summer and winter months, like for example [[Mallorca]], [[Ibiza]], [[Tenerife]], several Greek islands (like [[Kos]], [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]] or [[Corfu]]) or [[Hurghada]]. [[Ryanair]] also flies to [[London Stansted Airport]].

The city also has a central railway station ({{langx|de|[[Linz Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]]}}) on Austria's main rail axis, the [[West railway (Austria)|West railway]], linking Vienna with western Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The Linz central station has been awarded eight times (from 2005 to 2011 and 2014) by Austrian Traffic Club as the most beautiful train station in Austria.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vcoe.at/projekte/vcoe-bahntest-2014 |title=VCÖ Bahntest 2014 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119010849/https://www.vcoe.at/projekte/vcoe-bahntest-2014 |archive-date=19 November 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Local [[public transport]] comprises the [[Trams in Linz|city tram network]], the city [[trolleybus]] network and the city bus network, all operated by the Linz Linien division of Linz AG.<ref>[http://www.linzag.at/portal/portal/linzag/linzag/linzlinien/unternehmensdaten/centerWindow?plaginit=1&action=1 Linz Linien GmbH for Local Transport.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108161126/http://www.linzag.at/portal/portal/linzag/linzag/linzlinien/unternehmensdaten/centerWindow?plaginit=1&action=1 |date=8 November 2017 }} Linz AG.

==Population==
The urban area includes (parts of) 13 other municipalities with together 271,000 inhabitants. Linz is also part of the Linz-Wels-Steyr [[metropolitan area]] of [[Upper Austria]], home to around one third of the state's population (460,000 people) and second-largest urban area in Austria.<ref>[https://www.statistik.at/blickgem/blick1/g40101.pdf City of Linz Website]</ref><ref>[https://www.linz.at/zahlen/040%5FBevoelkerung/040%5FHauptwohnsitzbevoelkerung/ Population ] </ref>{{historical populations|1869|49635|1880|56569|1890|65090|1900|83356|1910|97852|1923|107463|1934|115338|1939|128177|1951|184685|1961|195978|1971|204889|1981|199910|1991|203044|2001|183504|2011|189889|2021|206853|align=none|cols=2|source=Censuses<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic Censuses - STATISTICS AUSTRIA|url=https://www.statistik.at/en/statistics/population-and-society/population/population-stock/historic-censuses|publisher=Statistics Austria}}</ref>}}

As many central European cities, the cityscape of Linz is characterised by small and several sacred buildings. The Mariä Empfängnis Dom or [[New Cathedral, Linz|New Cathedral]] is the biggest church in Austria, not by height (it is roughly 2 metres shorter than the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] (''Stephansdom'') in Vienna), but by capacity.

The historic centre is characterised by its medieval architectural style, whereas in those parts of the city that border with the historic centre the architecture is of [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], [[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-baroque]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neo-renaissance]] styles. Even further from the historic centre there are living areas, such as ''Franckviertel'', ''Froschberg'', ''Bindermichl'' and ''Kleinmünchen'' southern of the Danube and ''Alt-Urfahr'' northern of the Danube. These areas are where residential buildings can be found that are still referred to as "[[Hitlerbauten]]" or "Hitler buildings", because they were built during the interwar period and the time of Nazi dictatorship. The residential area called ''Gugl'' became a well liked living area among the wealthy at around 1900, which is why there are numerous villas still there today.

Amongst the newer buildings is the Linz Hauptbahnhof station, which was designed by [[Wilhelm Holzbauer]] and added the Terminal Tower skyscraper as part of a mixed-use complex. Between 2005 und 2011 it was voted Austria's most beautiful railway station seven times in a row by the ''Verkehrsclub Österreich''. The Wissensturm ("Tower of knowledge") with a height of about 63 metres, houses the public library and the ''[[Folk high school|Volkshochschule]]'', an adult education centre. It was designed by Franz Kneidinger and Heinz Stögmüller and opened in 2007. [[Lentos Art Museum]], which opened in 2003, was designed by Zürich-based architects Weber & Hofer and the [[Musiktheater Linz|Musiktheater]] (music theatre), which opened in 2013, was designed by Terry Pawson.

==Culture==
The city is now home to a vibrant music and arts scene that is well-funded by the city and the state of Upper Austria. Between Lentos Art Museum and the "Brucknerhaus", is the "Donaulände", which is also referred to as "Kulturmeile" ("culture mile"). This is a park alongside the river, which is used mainly by young people to relax and meet in summer. It is also used for the [[Ars Electronica#Festival|Ars Electronica Festival]] in early September and the "Stream Festival", which takes place annually. In June, July and August the "Musikpavillon" is placed in the park where musical groups of different styles perform on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays free of charge. <br />

Linz has other culture institutions, such as the Posthof, which is near the harbour,<ref name="PosthofLinz">{{cite web |url=http://www.posthof.at/ |title=Welcome Posthof 04 2008 |publisher=Posthof |access-date=6 April 2008}}</ref> and the [[Stadtwerkstatt]], which is by the river Danube.<ref name="Stadtwerkstadt">{{cite web |url=http://www.servus.at/stwst/ |title=Stadtwerkstadt |publisher=Stadtwerkstadt |access-date=6 April 2008}}</ref> The [[Pflasterspektakel]], an international street art festival, takes place each year in July in and around the Landstraße and the main square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pflasterspektakel.at/eng/index_default.asp |title=Pflasterspektakel Festival |publisher=Magistrat der Landeshauptstadt Linz |access-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808084131/https://www.pflasterspektakel.at/eng/index_default.asp |archive-date=8 August 2010}}</ref>

The Ars Electronica Center can be considered as the centre of media art and attracts every year during its festival national and international guests to Linz.

The latest project developed by Linz in the context of the City of Media Arts project is the Valie Export Center, which is located in the Tabakfabrik (tobacco factory) and carried out in cooperation with the University of Art and Design Linz. It serves as an international research hub for media and performance art. Beyond that, it comprises the legacy as well as the archives of the most renowned media artist coming from Linz, [[Valie Export]], who has received numerous national as well as international prizes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Valie Export Center in der Tabakfabrik |date=15 February 2017 |url=http://ooe.orf.at/news/stories/2825967/ |access-date=29 January 2018}}</ref> Along with the Ars Electronica archives, Linz hosts two internationally renowned archives for media art.<ref>{{cite web |title=Linz & Media Arts |url=http://www.cityofmediaarts.at/linz-media-arts/ |access-date=29 January 2018}}</ref>

Since 2009, the Open Commons Linz initiative has made available a wide variety of "free" data: geo-data and statistical information having to do with city life, local government, recreation and tourism. An associated effort is the Hotspot initiative that has installed 202 hotspots providing free WLAN, as well as Public Server, the municipal cloud available to all citizens registered in Linz. Linz is thus at the forefront in Europe when it comes to universal access to open data.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Commons Linz |url=http://www.cityofmediaarts.at/topic/open-commons_linz// |access-date=26 May 2017}}</ref>

===Cinema===
The history of cinema and film begins in Linz in September 1896, when, as part of a variety programme, a film programme was shown in "Roithner's vaudeville" for the first time in Upper Austria. Until the next screening of a film it took until 20 March 1897, when Johann Bläser's travelling cinema guested in the "Hotel of the Golden Ship".

Until the opening of the first cinemas with regular programme, it took till the end of the year 1908. At that time, Karl Lifka opened his "Lifka's Grand Théâtre électrique" in that building, where already the very first film showing took place. Subsequently, the second cinema of Linz was opened a few months later.

As the owner of travelling cinemas, Johann Bläser, got settled in Linz, he bought the "Hotel of the Golden Ship", and installed a cinema in it, the "Bio-Kinematograph". 
The third stationary cinema, called "Kino Kolloseum", in town was founded around 1910 by the vaudeville operator Karl Roithner. Its first location was the former festival hall at Hessenplatz.

The Linz International Short Film Festival is the first film festival in Upper Austria to focus on international short films. It launched in October 2018 at the Moviemento in Linz, showing 114 films over four days. The concept goes back to the festival director Parisa Ghasemi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Linz International Short Film Festival Presse |url=https://linzisfilmfestival.com/de/presse/ |language=de |access-date=27 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010213515/https://linzisfilmfestival.com/de/presse/ |archive-date=10 October 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Culinary specialties ===
In Linz there are both traditional restaurants and old wine taverns, as well as modern and exotic cuisine. The influence of 140 nations can be felt in Linz's culinary offerings. A coalition of over 40 restaurants, cafes and among other locations bars are called "hotspots". Moreover, Linz has several à la carte restaurants and [[Gault Millau]] gourmet restaurants.

Typical dishes in Linz include not only the famous [[Linzer torte]] but also [[knödel]] and [[strudel]] in many different kinds of variations. Another specialty is the [[kartoffelkäse|erdäpfelkäs]], a spread made from mashed potatoes and cream. Some well-known chefs from Linz are Lukas Erich, who cooks in the ''Verdi'' and Georg Essig from the ''Der neue Vogelkäfig''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Linzer Gastronomie |url=http://www.linz.at/tourismus/549.asp |language=de |access-date=20 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629091616/http://www.linz.at/tourismus/549.asp |archive-date=29 June 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Commemorative year 2018===
The project "Linz 1938/1918", which started on 29 June 2018, commemorates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic (1918) and 80 years of "political union" (1938). With this installation in the public space, presented in the city center, Linz fulfills its responsibility and commitment to maintaining peace with its declaration, making a contribution to dealing with the past. The idea is to reach people who have little relation to the years of 1918 or 1938.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.linz.at/presse/kultur_top_news_86865.asp |title=Gedenkjahr 2018 |access-date=25 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529053919/https://www.linz.at/presse/kultur_top_news_86865.asp |archive-date=29 May 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

* Lakes and public swimming pools: [[Pichlinger See]], [[Pleschinger See]], [[Weikerlsee]], Biesenfeldbad, Hummelhofbad, Parkbad, Schörgenhubbad. One of the first public swimming pools was the former "Fabriksarm", a Danube branch stream (from Parkbad to Winterhafen) that was filled up in 1890. Afterwards a makeshift at the "Obere Donaulände" was built, which existed until a flood in 1954. In 1901 the "Städtische Schwimmschule" (city swimming school) was built at the place of the former Parkbad. 
* Botanischer Garten: About 100,000 visitors are attracted by Botanischer Garten, which makes it one of the most visited sights of the city since 1952. Situated at Bauernberg, and comprising 4.2 hectares, the arrangement distinguishes by its harmonious design, its abundance of plant species (about 8,000 different types in culture) and the multifaceted cultural and event programme. 
* Donaulände or "Lände": public park on the Danube between Lentos and the [[Brucknerhaus]]. In summer, the Donaulände is a common meeting point among young people living in Linz. It also hosts the Linzer Klangwolke.

With 10,807 square metres of green area, it is the second largest inner-city park. The city of Linz has acquired this area due to a barter with the Austrian postal service. Since Schiller Park in 1909, there has been no newly opened park of this magnitude in the centre of Linz.
* Landschaftspark Bindermichl-Spallerhof: In the first phase of the establishment of the 8.3 -hectare sized area, which reconnects the boroughs Bindermichl and Spallerhof, the province of Upper Austria was responsible for the expansion of the park. The park replaces the urban motorway, which runs subterranean in this area since 2006. Old paths were re-established and until mid 2007 the city's gardeners designed prethe new parkland with 550 trees and various shrubs, perennials and flower beds.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
