According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 140,751 people.{{PH census|current}}

The [[Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway]] (SCTEx) traverses this town, the exit of which is located in Barangay Manuali.

==History==
Porac was founded on October 31, 1594, upon acceptance by Fray Mateo Peralta in the Friar's Intermediate Chapter (recorded by Fray Gaspar de San Agustin, by saying Porac has its First Minister and Friar, Fray Mateo de Mendoza.

The General Headquarters and Military Camp Base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] was stationed in Porac from 1942 to 1946 and the local military operates against the Imperial Japanese military and local collaborators from 1942 to 1945. The [[Mexican Expeditionary Air Force]] were given a base around Porac to help liberate the country from the [[Japanese Empire]] in [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://municipalityofporac.com/hop.html |title=History of Porac |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425050120/http://municipalityofporac.com/hop.html |archive-date=2013-04-25 }}</ref>

Babo Pangulo offers a view of Porac and Mount Negron.

Porac is an important source of granite and a tamping ground of minerals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Porac |url=http://eksite.com/balen/porac.html |publisher=electronic Kabalen |access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref>

Porac is home to the Mekeni Food Corporation, an "AAA" Meat Processing Plant accredited with the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS). Being classified under the "AAA" category, it is qualified to market its products, not just in the local, but in the international market as well. This means that it is compliant to all government regulatory requirements to assure food quality and safety in its operations (Sun Star, 2006).

In 2014, [[Ayala Land]] and Leonio Land embarked on developing a mixed-used estate in Porac known as Alviera. The development project combines business, residential, recreational, leisure, and institutional. The local government dubbed Alviera as the regional growth center of Central Luzon.[http://www.poracpampanga.gov.ph/index.php/business/attractions/25-welcome-message-11?highlight=WyJzYW5kYm94Il0=] Now, it is a premiere tourist destination in the north, and the Philippines' hub for karting with the presence of the [[Pampanga International Circuit]].<ref>Ladaw, D.

==Government==
[[File:Poractownhalljf.JPG|thumb|right|Town hall]]
The municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and the barangay captains for the barangays. The legislative branch is composed of the [[Sangguniang Bayan]] (town assembly), Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] for the youth sector.

==Spanish-era Roman Catholic churches==
[[File:Poracpampangajfa.JPG|thumb|Façade of Santa Catalina de Alejandria Parish Church]]
Since the founding of the town of Porac in 1867,<ref name="Porac LGU">{{cite web|title=History of Porac, Pampanga|url=http://www.poracpampanga.gov.ph/index.php/about-porac/history-of-porac|website=www.poracpampanga.gov.ph|access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref> various Roman Catholic structures have been built in the area to aid in the religious practices of the devout Kapampangans. As of writing, three notable Spanish-era religious structures are extant within the municipality. The largest of the three, the [[Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church (Porac)|Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church]] is located at Barangay Poblacion and still functions as one of Porac's main parochial structures. The other two are currently utilized as barangay chapels.

===Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church===
The [[Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church (Porac)|Santa Catalina de Alejandria parish church]] is under the jurisdiction of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando]]. Its original structure, built in 1872, is largely intact but slight revisions have been made to the inside. It underwent restoration in the 1980s. The church is {{convert|52|m}} long, {{convert|12|m}} wide and {{convert|9|m}} high.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pampanga.islandsphilippines.com/natural.php |title=Pampanga Religious Tourist Attractions - Pampanga Province Islands Philippines |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-date=2013-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103193107/http://pampanga.islandsphilippines.com/natural.php |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the earthquake of 2019, the church belfry has been destroyed a day after Easter Sunday. Rebuilding operations are planned with call for donations to restore the church bell tower.

===Pio Chapel===
The 1861 [[Pio Chapel]] is a circular chapel built by Don Felino Gil, founder of the Escuela de Artes y Oficios (now the Don Honorio Ventura Technical State University).<ref name="Henares - Pio Chapel">{{cite web|last1=Henares|first1=Ivan|title=Pampanga: Pio Chapel and the ethics of transferring heritage structures|url=http://www.ivanhenares.com/2006/11/pio-chapel-and-ethics-of-transferring.html|website=www.ivanhenares.com|access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref>

===Hacienda Dolores Chapel===
Another vintage chapel is located at Barangay Dolores, north of the Porac town proper. The Our Lady of Sorrows Chapel was said to be built by the Dolores family within the old Hacienda Dolores in 1856.<ref name="Flickr - Dolores chapel">{{cite web|title=Dolores chapel|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/11541098@N06/9582106406/|website=www.flickr.com|date=25 July 2013|access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref> The chapel, like the Pio chapel, is currently utilized as a community chapel. The chapel boasts of a slender octagonal belfry and Doric columns adorning the two-level façade. Notable features of the chapel are finials found on both levels of the façade.
