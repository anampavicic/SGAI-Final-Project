'''Ahmednagar''' (officially '''Ahilya Nagar''')<ref name="EconomicTimes-13Mar23"/><ref name="ToI-13Mar24"/> is a city in, and the headquarters of, the [[Ahmednagar district]], [[Maharashtra]], India.

Ahmednagar is a relatively small town and shows less development than the nearby western Maharashtra cities of Mumbai and Pune. Ahmednagar is home to 19 sugar factories and is also the birthplace of the cooperative movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Due to scarce rainfall, the city often suffers from drought. [[Marathi language|Marathi]] is the primary language for daily-life communication. The city administration has recently published a plan of developing the city by year 2031.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nagarick |url=http://nagarick.blogspot.com/2007/06/ahmednagar-by-year-2031-city-planning.html |title=Ahmednagar by year 2031 |publisher=Nagarick.blogspot.com |date=6 June 2007 |access-date=23 November 2011}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Ahmednagar took its name from [[Ahmad Nizam Shah I]], who founded the town in 1494<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Ahmednagar |volume=1|page=432}}</ref> on the site of a battlefield where he won a battle against superior Bahamani forces.<ref name="The Kingdom of Ahmadnagar">{{cite book|title=The Kingdom of Ahmadnagar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5C4hBqKdkEsC&pg=PA38|year=1966|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-2651-9|page=38}}</ref> It was close to the site of the village of [[Bhingar]].<ref name="The Kingdom of Ahmadnagar" /> With the breakup of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], Ahmad established a new sultanate in Ahmednagar, also known as [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Nizam Shahi dynasty]].<ref name="sen2">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=118–119}}</ref>

==History==
The town Ahmednagar was founded in 1494 by [[Ahmad Nizam Shah I]] on the site of a more ancient city, [[Bhingar]].<ref name=EB1911/> With the breakup of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], Ahmad established a new sultanate in Ahmednagar, also known as [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Nizam Shahi dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sohoni |first1=Pushkar |title=The Architecture of a Deccan Sultanate: Courtly Practice and Royal Authority in Late Medieval India |date=2018 |publisher=I.B. Tauris |location=London |isbn=9781784537944}}</ref>

It was one of the [[Deccan sultanates]], which lasted until its conquest by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]] in 1636. [[Aurangzeb]], the last Mughal emperor, who spent the latter years of his reign, 1681–1707, in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], died in Ahmednagar and is buried at [[Khuldabad]], near Aurangabad in 1707, with a small monument marking the site.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

In 1759, the [[Peshwa]] of the [[Maratha]]s obtained possession of the place from [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and in 1795 it was ceded by the Peshwa to the Maratha chief [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]]. In 1803 Ahmednagar was besieged by a British force under [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]] and captured.<ref name=EB1911/> It was afterward restored to the Marathas, but again came into the possession of the British in 1817, according to the terms of the [[Treaty of Poona]],<ref name=EB1911/> and was known as '''Ahmednuggur'''.

In 19th century American Christian missionaries opened first modern schools in this town. According to a report there were four girls' school running under the superintendence of [[Cynthia Farrar]] around the 1850s. [[Jyotirao Phule|Mahatma Jyotirao Phule]] visited them and got inspired to open school for girls in Poona. Later, he enrolled his wife [[Savitribai Phule]] in Farrar's school in a teacher's training program. Farrar was from America and spent his entire life in Ahmednagar running her schools, these girls' schools were one of the first such kind in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cynthia Farrar — Missionary woman who inspired Jotirao Phule |date=28 January 2023 |url=https://thesatyashodhak.com/cynthia-farrar-missionary-woman-who-inspired-jotirao-phule/ }}</ref>

On 31 May 2023, [[Eknath Shinde]] (the [[List of chief ministers of Maharashtra|chief minister of Maharashtra]]) announced that Ahmednagar would be renamed "Ahilya Nagar", in honour of [[Ahilyabai Holkar]]<ref name="HindustanTimes-31May23">{{cite news |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-ahmednagar-to-be-renamed-as-ahilya-nagar-announces-cm-eknath-shinde-101685533253429.html |title=Maharashtra's Ahmednagar to be renamed as Ahilya Nagar, announces CM Eknath Shinde |newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=31 May 2023 }}</ref> who was [[Rani]] of [[Indore State|Indore]], within the [[Maratha Confederacy]] in the late 18th-century.
