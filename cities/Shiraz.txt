The earliest reference to the city is on [[Elam|Elamite]] clay tablets dated to 2000 BCE, found in June 1970, while digging to make a kiln for a brick factory in the south western corner of the city. The tablets written in ancient [[Elamite language|Elamite]] name a city called Tiraziš.<ref>Cameron, George G. ''Persepolis Treasury Tablets'', University of Chicago Press, 1948, pp. 115.</ref><nowiki> </nowiki> [[Phonetically]], this is interpreted as /tiračis/ or /ćiračis/. This name became Old Persian /širājiš/; through regular sound change comes the [[modern Persian]] name ''Shirāz''. The name Shiraz also appears on clay sealings found at a 2nd-century CE [[Sassanid]] ruin, east of the city. By some of the native writers, the name Shiraz has derived from a son of [[Tahmuras]], the third Shāh (King) of the world according to Ferdowsi's [[Shāhnāma]].<ref name="Conder 1827">{{cite book|last=Conder|first=Josiah|title=Persia and China|publisher=Printed for J.

==History==
{{Main|History of Shiraz|Timeline of Shiraz}}

===Pre-Islamic era===
Though, there is no definitive record of its existence prior to the late 7th century CE, few archaeological finds dating from 1933 and beyond indicate that the site or vicinity of Shiraz was likely settled in the pre-Islamic era as early as the 6th century BCE.<ref name="BerneyandRing644">Berney and Ring, p. 644.</ref> A number of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]-era remains have been discovered around the city, including reliefs at [[Barm-e Delak]] to the east and [[Guyim, Shiraz|Guyim]] to the northwest, and ruins of Sasanian fortresses at [[Qasre Abunasr|Qasr-e Abu Nasr]] to the east and Fahandezh.<ref name="Limbert4-5">Limbert, pp. 4–5.</ref> The latter is identified with the fortress of Shahmobad mentioned as being in Shiraz by the 10th-century geographical work, ''[[Hudud al-'alam]]''.<ref name="Limbert4-5" /> the Sasanian and early Islamic-era clay seals found at [[Qasre Abunasr|Qasr-e-Abu Nasr]] mention the name "Shiraz" alongside the name of the Sasanian administrative district of the area, [[Ardashir-Khwarrah]].<ref name="Limbert5">Limbert, p. 5.</ref> According to the diplomat and academic [[John Limbert]], this indicates that the name "Shiraz" is traced back to the Elamite "Shirrazish" and that both refer to a settlement that existed at the site of [[Qasre Abunasr|Qasr-e-Abu Nasr]].<ref name="Limbert5" /> 

Interpretations of what type of settlement ancient Shiraz was vary. According to Berney and Ring, the lack of references to Shiraz in early Persian sources suggests the city could not have been more than a way-station in the plain in which it lies.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> On the other hand, according to [[Abdul Majid Arfaei|Abdolmajed Arfaee]], Achaemenid-era Shiraz must have been one of the most important settlements in the area.<ref name="Arfaee 2008">{{cite book |last1=Arfaee |first1=Abdolmajid |author1-link=Abdul Majid Arfaei |title=The Geographical Background of the Persepolis Tablets |date=2008 |publisher=University of Chicago |location=Chicago |pages=29–33 |url=https://www.proquest.com/openview/142c3a3a61b1cf0a4710fd1dd240b728/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750}}</ref> He bases this on its frequent appearance in the [[Persepolis Administrative Archives]] (84 different tablets) as well as the number of workers present – in groups as large as 490.<ref name="Arfaee 2008"/> Most textual references to Shiraz involve rations for workers; it is never mentioned as a travel destination.<ref name="Arfaee 2008"/> Arfaee says that Sasanian Shiraz was relatively insignificant before its re-foundation in the early Islamic period.<ref name="Arfaee 2008"/> According to John Limbert,<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Limbert |url=https://www.mei.edu/profile/john-limbert |access-date=2024-03-02 |website=Middle East Institute |language=en}}</ref> however, Shiraz prospered between the 6th and 8th-centuries CE and was possibly the administrative center for the Shiraz plain until the modern city of Shiraz was founded.<ref>Limbert, pp. 5–6.</ref>

===Early Islamic era===
Shiraz was founded or restored in 693 by [[Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi]], the brother of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] viceroy of the eastern half of the [[caliphate]], [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], or the latter's kinsman [[Muhammad ibn Qasim]].<ref>Lambton, p. 472.</ref><ref name="Limbert4">Limbert, p. 4.</ref> The Arab Muslim army had conquered the wider region of [[Fars Province|Fars]], where the site of Shiraz is located, in several expeditions launched from their garrison town of [[Basra]] between 640 and 653, and specifically captured the immediate area around Shiraz early on, in 641. This area did not possess any cities, though there were a number of forts which were forced to pay tribute to the Arabs.<ref name="Limbert6">Limbert, p. 6.</ref> The Sasanians held firm in [[Istakhr]], their capital in Fars, until the Arabs captured it in a heavy battle in 653, during which the plain of Shiraz had been utilized as an Arab campground.<ref name="Limbert6" /> Because of [[Istakhr]]'s deep association with the Sasanian Empire and the [[Zoroastrian]] religion, the [[Arabs]] sought to establish in nearby Shiraz a rival cultural and administrative center.<ref name="Limbert6" /> Thus, during its initial founding in 693, the city was planned to be much larger than [[Isfahan]].<ref name="Limbert6" /> However, the initial ambitions were not realized and Shiraz remained a "provincial backwater" in the shadow of Istakhr until at least the late 9th century, according to Limbert.<ref name="Limbert6" /> This is partly attributed to the reticence of the largely Zoroastrian population of Fars to inhabit the Islamic Arab city.<ref name="Limbert6" /> As the population gradually shifted to Islam from Zoroastrianism and Istakhr concurrently declined, Shiraz grew into the practical center of Fars.<ref name="Limbert6" />

According to Muslim traditional sources, Shiraz was used as a hideout by three of the brothers of the [[Shia Muslim]] imam [[Ali al-Ridha]] following the latter's death in 817/18 and later by one of the brothers' sons, Ali ibn Hamza ibn Musa, until he was found and executed by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] authorities in {{Circa|835}}.<ref>Limbert, pp. 6–7.</ref> As Abbasid authority waned during this period, regional dynasties emerged with considerable autonomy.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> In the late 9th century, the Iranian Muslim [[Saffarid dynasty]] under [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar|Ya'qub ibn al-Layth]] made Shiraz the capital of their autonomous state, which encompassed most of modern-day Iran.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /><ref name="Limbert6" /><ref name="Lambton473">Lambton, p. 473.</ref> In 894, Ya'qub's brother and successor, [[Amr ibn al-Layth|Amr]], founded the city's first [[congregational mosque]], today known as the [[Atigh Jame' Mosque]].<ref>Limbert, pp. 6–8.</ref><ref name="Lambton473" />

The Iranian [[Buyid dynasty]] under [[Imad al-Dawla|Imad al-Dawla Ali ibn Buya]] ousted the Saffarids in 933 and his nephew and successor, [['Adud al-Dawla|'Adud al-Dawla Fana Khusraw]], took over and ruled Fars between 949 and 983, and added Iraq, the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate, to his Shiraz-based domains in 977;<ref name="Lambton473" /> the Abbasids thenceforth became a puppet state of the Shiraz-based dynasty.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> Shiraz developed into the largest and most prosperous city of Fars and an important economic and cultural center of the [[caliphate]].<ref name="Lambton473" /><ref name="Limbert9">Limbert, p. 9.</ref> Adud al-Dawla had a large library, a hospital and several mosques, [[bazaar]]s, [[caravanserai]]s, palaces and gardens built in the city, while south of it he erected a fortified camp for his troops, known as Kard Fana Khusraw, in 974.<ref name="Lambton473" /><ref name="Limbert9" /> One of the congregational mosques built by Adud al-Dawla has survived until the present day.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> Two Zoroastrian [[fire temple]]s also existed in Shiraz,<ref name="Lambton473" /> catering to the Persians who had not converted to Islam.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> One of Adud al-Dawla's palaces stretched out for nearly three miles and consisted of 360 rooms.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" />

Under the Buyids, Shiraz was divided into twelve quarters and had eight gates.<ref name="Limbert9" /> It owed its economic prosperity to the booming agricultural trade of Fars.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> The city largely consumed the agricultural products of the province, including [[Grape|grapes]], [[linen]], [[wool]], cotton, [[collyrium]], rose, violet and palm-blossom water.<ref name="Limbert9" /> It was also a market for rug weavers and painters to sell their pricey products, a testament to the residents' wealth.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> At the time, wine, grains, gold and silver were exported from the Farsi port cities of [[Siraf]] and Najairam.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" /> Adud al-Dawla patronized scientific, medical and Islamic religious research in Shiraz.<ref name="BerneyandRing644" />

The city was spared destruction by the invading [[Mongolian Empire|Mongols]], when its local ruler offered tributes and submission to [[Genghis Khan]]. Shiraz was again spared by [[Tamerlane]], when in 1382 the local monarch, Shah Shoja agreed to submit to the invader.<ref name="Shiraz history">{{cite web|url=http://www.shirazcity.org/shiraz/Shiraz%20Information/shiraz_history/History%20e.htm|title=History of Shiraz|access-date=31 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206151708/http://www.shirazcity.org/shiraz/Shiraz%20Information/shiraz_history/History%20e.htm|archive-date=6 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, thanks to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists.

===Safavid Empire===
[[File:76 Chardin Shiraz.jpg|thumb|260px|An illustration of Shiraz by French traveler [[Jean Chardin]] in 1670s while he was travelling through the Safavid empire]]

In 1504, Shiraz was captured by the forces of [[Ismail I]], the founder of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Eynasty]]. Throughout the Safavid empire (1501–1722) Shiraz remained a provincial capital and [[Imam Quli Khan (governor)|Emam Qoli Khan]], the governor of Fars under [[Abbas the Great]], constructed many palaces and ornate buildings in the same style as those built during the same period in [[Isfahan]], the capital of the Empire.<ref name="Shiraz history" /> After the fall of the Safavids, Shiraz suffered a period of decline, worsened by the raids of the [[Pashtun people|Afghans]] and the rebellion of its governor against [[Nader Shah]]; the latter sent troops to suppress the revolt. The city was besieged for many months and eventually sacked. At the time of [[Nader Shah]]'s murder in 1747, most of the historical buildings of the city were damaged or ruined, and its population fell to 50,000, one-quarter of that during the 16th century.<ref name="Shiraz history" />

Shiraz soon returned to prosperity under the rule of [[Karim Khan Zand]], who made it his capital in 1762. Employing more than 12,000 workers, he constructed a royal district with a fortress, many administrative buildings, a mosque, and one of the finest covered bazaars in Iran.<ref name="Shiraz history" /> He had a moat built around the city, constructed an irrigation and drainage system, and rebuilt the city walls.<ref name="Shiraz history" /> However, Karim Khan's heirs failed to secure his gains. When [[Agha Mohammad Khan]], the founder of the [[Qajar dynasty]], eventually came to power, he wreaked his revenge on Shiraz by destroying the city's fortifications and moving the national capital to [[Tehran]].<ref name="Shiraz history" /> Although lowered to the rank of a provincial capital, Shiraz maintained a level of prosperity as a result of the continuing importance of the trade route to the Persian Gulf. Its governorship was a royal prerogative throughout the [[Qajar dynasty]].<ref name="Shiraz history" /> Many of the famous gardens, buildings and residences built during this time contribute to the city's present skyline.

Shiraz is the birthplace of the co-founder of the [[Baháʼí Faith]], the [[Báb]] (Siyyid 'Ali-Muhammad, 1819–1850). In this city, on the evening of 22 May 1844, he first declared his mission as the bearer of a new divine revelation.<ref name="babism-browne">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Browne, E.G.|title=Babism|encyclopedia=Religious Systems of the World: A Contribution to the Study of Comparative Religion|pages=333–53|publisher=Swann Sonnenschein|location=London|year=1890|url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm|access-date=21 February 2007}}</ref> For this reason Shiraz is a holy city for Baháʼís, and the city, particularly the house of the Báb, was identified as a place of [[Baháʼí pilgrimage|pilgrimage]].<ref name="smith2">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith|first=Peter|encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title=Shiraz: the House of the Báb|year=2000|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-85168-184-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/314 314]|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/314}}</ref> Due to the [[persecution of Baháʼís|hostile climate towards Baháʼís]] in Iran, the house has been the target of repeated attacks; the house was destroyed in 1979, to be paved over two years later and made into a public square.<ref name="smith2" />

In 1910, a [[pogrom]] of the Jewish quarter started after [[1910 Shiraz blood libel|false rumours]] that the Jews had ritually murdered a Muslim girl. In the course of the riots, 12 Jews were murdered and about 50 were injured, and the 6,000 Jews of Shiraz were robbed of all their possessions.<ref name="Littman12">{{Cite book|author=Littman|date=1979|pages=12, 14|title=Jews Under Muslim Rule: The Case of Persia}}</ref>

During the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], Shiraz became the center of attention again. Many important landmarks like Tombs of Poets' such as [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]]<ref name="saadi-iranchamber" /> and [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]],<ref name="hafez-iranica" /> were constructed and presented to the public.

Lacking any great industrial, religious or strategic importance, Shiraz became an administrative center, although its population has nevertheless grown considerably since the [[Iranian Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Clint Lucas|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/iran/shiraz/history|title=Shiraz History – Shiraz Travel Guide|publisher=Lonely Planet|date=29 April 2011|access-date=5 May 2011|archive-date=13 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913160141/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/iran/shiraz/history|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Modern times===
[[File:Narenjestan qavam pic by erfan hosseinpour.jpg|alt=Narenjestan Qavam|thumb|Narenjestan Qavam]]

The city's municipality and other related institutions have initiated restoration and reconstruction projects.<ref name="Shiraz history" />

Some of the most recent projects have been the complete restoration of the [[Arg of Karim Khan]] and of the Vakil Bath, as well as a comprehensive plan for the preservation of the old city quarters. Other noteworthy initiatives include the total renovation of the [[Qur'an Gate]] and the mausoleum of the poet [[Khwaju Kermani]], both located in the Allah-u-Akbar Gorge, as well as the restoration and expansion of the mausoleum of the famous Shiraz-born poets Hafiz and Saadi.<ref name="Shiraz history" />

==Geography==
[[File:Shiraz Gardens.jpg|thumb|Shiraz Garden Drives, in the north, has gardens predating the city's expansion.]]

The city of Shiraz, the capital of [[Fars province]], is located at 52 degrees 32 minutes east longitude and 29 degrees 36 minutes north latitude, and is 919 kilometers from [[Tehran]]. In the first official census of Iran in 1335, the city of Shiraz with a population of 170,659 people was the sixth most populous city in Iran. Shiraz is located in the south of [[Iran]] and the northwest of [[Fars province]]. It is built in a green plain at the foot of the [[Zagros Mountains]] {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Shiraz is {{convert|800|km|mi}} south of [[Tehran]].<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://landofaryan.tripod.com/shiraz.htm|title=Shiraz|publisher=Landofaryan.tripod.com|access-date=5 May 2011}}</ref>

A seasonal river, Dry River, flows through the northern part of the city and on into [[Maharloo Lake]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shiraz – Iran Observe|url=https://iranobserve.com/destinations/shiraz/|access-date=2022-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref> As of 1920, the area had a large forest of [[oak]] trees.<ref name="Sykes75">{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Percy|title=A History of Persia|year=1921|publisher=Macmillan and Company|location=London|page=75|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7307/view/1/75/}}</ref>

===Gardens===
Shiraz contains a considerable number of gardens. Due to population growth in the city, many of these gardens may be lost to give way to new developments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} Although some measures have been taken by the Municipality to preserve these gardens, many illegal developments still endanger them.{{Clarify|reason=|date=June 2020}}

===Climate===
[[File:Sunset in Shiraz.JPG|thumb|Sunset in Shiraz, with [[Mount Derak|Derock Mountain]] in the background]]

Shiraz's climate has distinct seasons, and is overall classed as a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh'', bordering ''BSk'').<ref name="autogenerated3" /> [[Summer]]s are hot, with a July average high of {{convert|38.7|C|F|1}}. [[Winter]]s are cool, with average low temperatures below freezing in January. Around {{convert|320|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain falls each year, almost entirely in the winter months, though in some cases as much as this has fallen in a single month (as in January 1965 and December 2004),<ref name="rainfall">{{Cite web |url=http://www.chaharmahalmet.ir/stat/archive/iran/far/SHIRAZ/25.asp |title=Shiraz rainfalls 1951 to 2005 |access-date=9 February 2013 |archive-date=16 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216014915/http://www.chaharmahalmet.ir/stat/archive/iran/far/SHIRAZ/25.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref> whilst in the year from July 1965 to June 1966 as little as {{convert|82.9|mm|in|1}} fell. The wettest year has been 1955/1956 with as much as {{convert|857.2|mm|in}}, though since 1959 the highest has been around {{convert|590|mm|in|1}} in each of 1995/1996 and 2004/2005.<ref name="rainfall" /> Due to Shiraz' high elevation and low latitude, the [[UV index]] is extremely high during summer which is further exacerbated by the high frequency of sunshine.

Despite being in a relatively dry climate, extreme weather is not a rare occasion. On 25 March 2019, flash floods from heavy rains has resulted in 19 deaths and over 200 injuries.

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of Iran}}

Shiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India.<ref name=Bahai>{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/2000/urbanbh2.htm|title=Religious Dissidence and Urban Leadership: Baha'is in Qajar Shiraz and Tehran|publisher=Personal.umich.edu|date=20 April 1968|access-date=5 May 2011}}</ref> Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf.

He left his native town at a young age for [[Baghdad]] to study [[Arabic literature]] and [[Islamic Science|Islamic sciences]] at [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]]. When he reappeared in his native Shiraz, he was an elderly man. Shiraz, under Atabak Abubakr Sa'd ibn Zangy (1231–1260) was enjoying an era of relative tranquility. Saadi was not only welcomed to the city but he was highly respected by the ruler and enumerated among the greats of the province. He seems to have spent the rest of his life in Shiraz. Hafiz, another famous poet and mystic was also born in Shiraz. A number of scientists also originate from Shiraz. [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]], a 13th-century astronomer, mathematician, physician, physicist and scientist was from Shiraz. In his ''The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens'', he also discussed the possibility of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>A. Baker and L. Chapter (2002), "Part 4: The Sciences". In M.
