The city is populated by a mix of ethnic [[Alifuru people|Alifuru]] (original [[Moluccans]]), [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Butonese people|Butonese]], [[Bugis]], [[Makassar people|Makassar]], [[Papuan people|Papuan]], [[Minahasan people|Minahasa]], [[Minangkabau people|Minang]], [[Flobamora]] (Flores, Sumba, Alor and Timor ethnics) and those of foreign descent (Chinese, Arabian-Ambonese, Spanish-Ambonese, German-Ambonese, Portuguese-Ambonese and Dutch-Ambonese). Between 1999 and 2002, there was [[Maluku sectarian conflict|social unrest]] motivated by racial intolerance.

==History==

===Colonial era===
[[File:Amboina. 17th century print, most likely English..jpg|thumb|250px|left|Amboina in the 17th century under Portugal.]]
Ambon was colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1526 and originally named ''Nossa Senhora de Anunciada'', founded by Portuguese-Moluccan Governor ''Sancho de Vasconcelos''. The Portuguese were driven out by the Dutch in 1605. Except for brief periods of British rule, the island remained under Dutch control until Indonesia's independence in 1945.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Ambon (1930).svg|thumb|200px|[[Coat of arms]] of Ambon during colonial era, granted in 1930]]
During the Dutch period, Ambon was the seat of the Dutch resident and military commander of the [[Maluku Islands]]. The town was protected by Fort Victoria, and the 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' characterized it as "a clean little town with wide streets, well planted".<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Amboyna}}</ref> The population was divided into two classes, ''orang burger'' (citizens) and ''orang negri'' (villagers), the former being a class of native origin enjoying certain privileges conferred on their ancestors by the old Dutch East India Company. There were also, besides the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], some [[Arab]]s, [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] and a few [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers. Ambon was a center of Christian missionary activity, and Ambon and the surrounding islands have many Christians as well as the Muslims that predominate in most of Indonesia.

On 22 December 1902, the Apostolic Prefecture of Dutch New Guinea was established in the city, later to be promoted as the [[Diocese of Amboina]].
[[File:Ambon refugees, 1999.jpg|thumb|Indonesian military forces evacuate refugees from Ambon.]]

Ambon Island was the site of a major Dutch naval base and was of strategic importance during WW2. In 1941, Dutch forces with the assistance of Australian forces reinforced Ambon in anticipation of a Japanese attack.{{sfn|Koninklijke Nederlands Indonesisch Leger|1948|pp=284}} Japanese forces attacked Ambon as part of their [[Dutch East Indies campaign|attack on the Dutch East Indies]]. Despite formidable defenses, Ambon fell when its defenders surrendered after [[Battle of Ambon|four days of fighting]] on 3 February 1942.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=434}} Following the battle, Japanese forces committed numerous acts of atrocities, including the execution of over 300 Dutch and Australian POWs at Laha airfield.{{sfn|Klemen |2000}}

===Conflicts since independence===
In 1950 Ambon was the center of an uprising against Indonesian rule, caused by the self-proclaimed [[Republic of the South Moluccas]]. Indonesian troops invaded the city during the [[Invasion of Ambon]] and reasserted control in just a few months. Many important buildings such as the Victoria Fort (APRMS main base) were heavily damaged during the confrontation.

In April and May 1958 during the [[Permesta]] rebellion in [[North Sulawesi]], the USA supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a [[Taiwan]]-based [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[front organisation]], [[Civil Air Transport]], flying CIA [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invader]] aircraft, repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned targets in and around Ambon. On 27 April a CIA raid set fire to a military command post, a fuel dump and a [[Royal Dutch Shell]] complex.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=115}} The attack on Shell was deliberate: the CIA had orders to hit foreign commercial interests in order to drive foreign trade away from Indonesia and undermine its economy.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}} The next day, the same CIA pilot [[Balikpapan#CIA air raid|bombed Shell interests at Balikpapan]] in [[East Kalimantan]] on [[Borneo]], which persuaded Shell to suspend tanker services from there.<ref>{{cite hansard |title=Commons Sitting: Oral Answers to Questions {{ndash}} Indonesia (British Vessels) |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1958/jun/11/indonesia-british-vessels#S5CV0589P0_19580611_HOC_160 |house=Commons |date=11 June 1958 |column_start=202 |column_end=203 |speaker=[[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]] |position=Minister of State for Foreign Affairs |access-date=21 November 2011 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231101224610/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1958/jun/11/indonesia-british-vessels#S5CV0589P0_19580611_HOC_160 |date=1 November 2023 }}</ref>

On 28 April a CIA air raid damaged an [[Indonesian Army]] barracks next to a marketplace.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=117}} On 30 April a CIA air raid hit the airstrip.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=118}} On 7 May a CIA air raid attacked Ambon airstrip, seriously damaging a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] and an [[Indonesian Air Force]] [[North American P-51 Mustang]] and setting fire to a number of fuel drums.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=121}} On 8 May a CIA B-26 tried to bomb an [[Indonesian Navy]] gunboat in Ambon harbour.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} Its bomb missed but it then machine-gunned the boat, wounding two crew.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} The [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] reinforced Ambon City's anti-aircraft defences with a number of {{cvt|12.7|mm|1}} machine guns.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} On 9 May a CIA B-26 attacked the city again.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} The machine-gunners returned fire and an Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang chased the B-26, but it escaped.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}}

On 15 May a CIA B-26 attacked a small ship, the ''Naiko'', in Ambon Bay.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} The ''Naiko'' was a merchant ship that the Indonesian Government had pressed into military service, and she was bringing a company of Ambonese troops home from [[East Java]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=128}} A CIA bomb hit the ''Naiko''{{'}}s engine room, killing one crew member and 16 infantrymen{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=128}} and setting the ship on fire.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} The B-26 then attacked Ambon city, aiming for the barracks. Its first bomb missed and exploded in a market-place next door.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} The next landed in the barracks compound but bounced and exploded near an ice factory.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} The B-26 in the May air raids was flown by a CAT pilot called [[Allen Lawrence Pope|Allen Pope]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=128}} On 18 May Pope attacked Ambon again. First he raided the airstrip again, destroying the C-47 and P-51 that he had damaged on 7 May.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=136}} Then he flew west of the city and tried to attack one of a pair of troop ships being escorted by the Indonesian Navy.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=136–137}} Indonesian forces shot down the B-26 but Pope and his Indonesian radio operator survived and were captured.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=139, 141}} Pope's capture immediately exposed the level of CIA support for the Permesta rebellion. Embarrassed, the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] quickly ended CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from the conflict.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=143}}

As part of the [[transmigration program]] in the 1980s, the [[Suharto]] government relocated many migrants, most of them Muslim, from densely overpopulated Java.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Between 1999 and 2002, Ambon was at the centre of [[Maluku sectarian conflict|sectarian conflict across the Maluku Islands]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/jan1999/indo-j30.shtml |title=Ambon rioting leaves 100 dead in Indonesia |newspaper=World Socialist Website |date=30 January 1999 |access-date=15 August 2006 |archive-date=10 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110224506/http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/jan1999/indo-j30.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/DB15Ae01.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020305153024/http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/DB15Ae01.html |url-status=unfit |archive-date=5 March 2002 |title=The Spice Islands legacy of violence |first=Bill |last=Guerin |newspaper=[[Asia Times]] |date=15 February 2002}}</ref> There was further religious violence in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/archive/religious-strife-a-daily-reality-in-ambon/ |title=Religious Strife a Daily Reality in Ambon |first=Nivell |last=Rayda |newspaper=[[Jakarta Globe]] |date=2 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924192012/http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/archive/religious-strife-a-daily-reality-in-ambon/ |archive-date=24 September 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
