'''Dumaguete''', officially the '''City of Dumaguete''' ({{IPA|tl|dʊmɐˈgɛtɛ|lang}}; {{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Dumaguete}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Dumaguete}}), is a 2nd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Negros Oriental]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 134,103 people.{{PH census|current}} It is the most populous city and the smallest city by land area in Negros Oriental as well as one of the two regional centers in [[Negros Island Region]] (the other one is [[Bacolod]]).

Dumaguete is a [[college town|university city]] with four large universities and several colleges, attracting students of the province and students from across the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. The city is best known for [[Silliman University]], the first [[Protestant]] and American university in the country and in Asia.<ref>[http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20080714-148252 "Heritage Diary of Negros Oriental"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312083544/http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20080714-148252 |date=2018-03-12 }}.

Accessed October 15, 2009.</ref> [[List of schools in Dumaguete|Schools in Dumaguete]] include 18 public elementary schools and eight public high schools.<ref name="Tourism"/>

Dumaguete is bounded by the towns of [[Bacong]], [[Sibulan]], and [[Valencia, Negros Oriental|Valencia]]. The power source of the city comes from the [[Palinpinon Geothermal Power Plant|geothermal power plant]] in Valencia.

==Etymology==
"Dumaguete" was coined from the [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] word {{Lang|ceb|daggit}}, which means "to snatch". The word {{Lang|ceb|dumaguet}}, meaning "to swoop", was coined because of the area's frequent raids by [[Moro people|Moro]] pirates and its power to attract and keep visitors, both local and foreign. In 1572, Diego López Povedano indicated the place as Dananguet, but [[cartographer]] Pedro Murillo Velarde in 1734 already used the present name of Dumaguete for the settlement.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |date=2018-07-18 |title=Dumaguete City |url=https://dumagueteinfo.com/attractions/listing/dumaguete-city/ |access-date=2024-02-03 |website=DumagueteInfo Attractions |language=en-US}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Dumaguete City was once settled by [[datu]]s from Borneo who exiled themselves into the newly established [[Madja-as|Kedatuan of Madja-as]].<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015034052020&seq=1 Maragtas: The story of the life experienced by the datus of Borneo ... and their purchase of the island from King Marikudo, who was king of the Negritos, in the year 1520  (Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro; Translated to English by Esther Abiera)]</ref> They participated in a successful war against [[Chola Empire|Chola]]-occupied Odtojonan in [[Borneo]] (The former homeland) as a constituent kingdom of Madja-as (the re-established nation). Eventually, they allied themselves under the nearby [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] as the people of Dumaguete adopted the Cebuano language, culture, and customs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/10-fun-facts-about-cagayan-de-oro/ |title=10 Fun Facts about Cagayan de Oro |date=5 February 2016 |website=About Cagayan de Oro |language=en-US |access-date=6 September 2018}}</ref>

=== Spanish colonial era ===
After the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]], the island of [[Negros]] was divided into the provinces of Negros Oriental and [[Negros Occidental]] by a royal decree executed by Governor General [[Valeriano Weyler]] on January 1, 1890. Dumaguete was also made the capital of the new Negros Oriental Province.

In 1898, months after the arrival of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] from exile, the [[Negros Revolution]] suddenly broke out. [[Negros Occidental]] Province, which was still ruled by the Spanish authorities, eventually surrendered to the Negrense Revolutionary Forces after a battle on November 6. They then began a week-long march which captured Dumaguete on November 24. By this time, the Spanish forces had left the entirety of [[Negros]]. The "[[Negros Republic]]" was then proclaimed on November 27.

=== American era ===
The American era saw the allegiance of the [[Republic of Negros]] grow towards a collaborationist stance as a Pro-American Protectorate amidst the [[Philippine–American War|Philippine-American War]]. The Americans saw the people of Negros as more dependable allies compared to other Filipinos. Therefore, Dumaguete observed the establishment of [[Silliman University]], the first American-founded university in Asia.<ref name="NHI">[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9c6mrxI4zoYUmFrNXU4ZGhlQWM/viewf "NHI Resolution No.7, Series 2002"].

=== Japanese occupation era ===
[[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|forces]] landed at Dumaguete on May 26, 1942, after the fall of the [[Philippines]], and all of [[Negros Oriental]] Province surrendered shortly thereafter. Resistance against the Japanese occupation continued by guerilla groups in the inner mountains, where many native residents had fled to. The local Negrense guerillas attacked the remaining Japanese officials and troops on August 6, 1945, and after their victory, they welcomed combined American and Filipino forces that formally liberated Negros Oriental.

=== Cityhood ===
The City of Dumaguete was formally created on July 15, 1948, under Philippine Congressional Republic Act No. 327, also known as the "Charter of the City of Dumaguete". This was later amended on June 21, 1969, by Republic Act No. 5797, which clarified and refined the powers and functions of the local government unit in the earlier act.

=== Martial law ===
{{main|Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|NASUTRA monopoly|Negros famine}}
According to journalist [[Crispin Maslog]] who was teaching at Silliman University at the time,<ref name=CrisMasML>{{Cite news |last=Maslog |first=Crispin |date=April 15, 2021 |title='Probinsyano' remembers Martial Law |language=en |work=[[Rappler]] |url=https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/probinsyano-remembers-martial-law |access-date=October 4, 2021}}</ref> Dumaguete was one of the first cities in the country to learn about [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]]' declaration of [[Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos|martial law]] on September 23, 1972. Local news station DYSR was able to pick up the news from an Australian broadcast. Elsewhere in the country, media outlets such as newspapers and broadcast stations had already been shut down, but DSYR was able to make the announcement before Information Secretary [[Francisco Tatad]] did at around noon. DYSR itself would be shut down later that day.<ref name=CrisMasML/>

Maslog recounts that Silliman University in Dumaguete was one of the last four universities in the Philippines to be allowed to reopen for classes, with Marcos himself complaining about instances where members of the political opposition such as Senators [[Jovito Salonga]] and [[Juan Liwag]] were invited to speak at the university.<ref name=CrisMasML/>

In the mid-1980s, the [[Marcos cronies|crony capitalism]] which characterized the Marcos administration had a major effect on the island of Negros in which Dumaguete is located.<ref name="ChicagoTribuneNegrosFamine">{{Cite news |last=Reaves |first=Joseph A. |date=November 24, 1985 |title=SUGAR-CHOKED ISLAND STARVING |language=en-US |work=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-11-24-8503210570-story.html |access-date=October 4, 2021}}</ref><ref name="CañaEsquire">{{Cite magazine |last=Caña |first=Paul John |date=April 15, 2021 |title=Sugar Wars: Looking Back at the Negros Famine of the 1980s |url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/negros-famine-of-the-1980s-a00289-20210415-lfrm2 |url-status=live |magazine=Esquire Magazine Philippines |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415100028/https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/negros-famine-of-the-1980s-a00289-20210415-lfrm2 |archive-date=April 15, 2021 |access-date=October 4, 2021}}</ref> A [[NASUTRA monopoly|sugar hoarding scheme]] by [[National Sugar Trading Corporation]] (NASUTRA) of [[Roberto Benedicto]] backfired,<ref name="CañaEsquire"/> resulting in the mass-firing of sugar workers in Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental.

==Geography and environment==
Dumaguete has a land area of {{convert|3362|ha}}, situated on the plains of the southeastern coast of the large island of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], near the mouth of the [[Banica River]]. Of the province's 19 municipalities and 6 cities, Dumaguete is the smallest in terms of land area. It is bounded on the north by [[Sibulan, Negros Oriental|Sibulan]], south by [[Bacong, Negros Oriental|Bacong]], and west by [[Valencia, Negros Oriental|Valencia]].

As a coastal city, it is bounded on the east by the [[Bohol Sea]] and the [[Tañon Strait]], serving as a natural border of the southeastern border of Negros Oriental. The city's topography is generally flat from two to six kilometers from the shoreline. It slopes gently upwards to the adjoining municipality of Valencia. The highest ground elevation is located at the boundary of the municipality of Valencia, about one hundred meters above mean sea level. About 93% of the land have slopes of less than 3%. The remaining areas have a 3% to 5% slope.

===Climate===
Dumaguete has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] according to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Climate classification with two distinct seasons: wet and dry. The wet season covers the period from June to November, and the dry season starts from December to May, the hottest being April and May. The average maximum temperature is 30.9&nbsp;°C and the average minimum temperature is 24.8&nbsp;°C for the 1991-2020 normals. The relative humidity of the locality for the past years was 81% with January registering the highest.

Northeast monsoon winds (amihan) bring cooler temperatures with little sometimes moderate rain to the city during late October until early March. Trade winds from the Pacific help moderate the sultry conditions of the dry season during April and May, and usually record less hot daytime conditions than the rest of the country; yet nearby warm seas also cause warm and humid nights during this time. When no major wind system is in power, trade winds can occur all year round, providing similar conditions.

[[File:BuglasanFest.jpg|thumb|Buglasan Festival]]
One of the city's important annual celebrations is the Sandurot Festival, which is held every September to commemorate Dumaguete's history.

''Pasundalan'' follows, gracing the city streets with dancing to drumbeats and other instruments participated by different barangays and schools in Dumaguete. The street dancing ends at Quezon Park after which the participants prepare for the grand ''Pasundayag'', a display of dances portraying different stories of the Dumaguete tradition.

Another important annual occasion in Dumaguete is the Buglasan Festival, also known locally as the "Festival of All Festivals", which is also held throughout the whole Negros Oriental province every October since 2002. The majority of activities are held in the Provincial Capitol and Ninoy Aquino Freedom Park with booths and local products either on display or for sale. It is also spread to other venues such as the Sidlakang Negros Village at Barangay Piapi and the city's Rizal Boulevard.
