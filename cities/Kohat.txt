'''Kohat''' ({{langx|ps|کوهاټ}}; {{langx|ur|{{Nastaliq|کوہاٹ}}}}) is a city that serves as the capital of the [[Kohat District]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]. It is regarded as a centre of the [[Bangash|Bangash tribe]] of [[Pashtuns]], who have lived in the region since the late 15th century.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HX-kit-U6y0C&q=kohat+1505&pg=RA1-PA22|title=Report on the settlement of the Kohat district in the Panjáb|last=commissioner.)|first=Henry St George Tucker (officiating deputy|date=1884|language=en}}</ref> With a population of over 220,000 people,<ref name="census2017" /> the city is the [[List of cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by population|fourth-largest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the [[List of cities in Pakistan by population|35th-largest in Pakistan]] in terms of population. Kohat's immediate environs were the site of frequent armed skirmishes between [[British Raj|British colonialist forces]] and local tribesmen in the mid to late 19th century. It is centred on a British-era fort, various bazaars, and a military cantonment. [[Pashto]] and the [[Kohati|Kohati dialect]] of [[Hindko]] are the main languages spoken in Kohat.

The city of Kohat is also the namesake of and largest city in the [[Kohat Division]], being over four times larger than the second-largest city in the division: [[Karak, Pakistan|Karak]].

== History ==

=== Early history ===

[[File:Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur - Foray to Kuhat (Kohat) - Walters W5967A - Full Page.jpg|thumb|left|A miniature painting depicting the 1505 visit of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]] to Kohat.]]

Little is known of Kohat's early history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_p_fAAAAMAAJ&q=kohat+history|title=The Eagle strikes: the Royal Indian Air Force, 1932-1950|last1=Chhina|first1=Rana|last2=Research|first2=Centre for Armed Forces Historical|date=2006|publisher=Ambi Knowledge Resources|isbn=978-81-903591-0-8|language=en}}</ref> According to local lore, Kohat was founded by an ancient Buddhist king by the name of ''Raja Kohat''.<ref name=":0" /> Another Buddhist Raja named Adh is believed to have established his domain on the north side of the city.<ref name=":0" /> A fort, now in ruins, serves as a marker of their domain. The remains of this fort known as Adh-e-Samut, is possibly named after Buddhist Raja Adh. The fort is still fitted with weaponry from the Buddhist period. The Buddhist kings built roads, which were in use until the end of the Mughal rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WRlAQAAQBAJ&q=kohat+buddhist&pg=PA338|title=A Concise History of Afghanistan in 25 Volumes|isbn=978-1-4907-1446-2|last1=Alikuzai|first1=Hamid Wahed|date=October 2013|publisher=Trafford }}</ref>

According to local tradition they arrived here in the time of Daulat Khán son of Bai Khán. This would make their settlement contemporaneous with that of the Baizai Bangashes which seems to have taken place previous to the time of Babar's invasion (A.D. 1505) . I believe, however, that they must have arrived before the settlement of Baizai.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tucker |first=H. St George |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HX-kit-U6y0C&q=kohat+1505&pg=RA1-PA22 |title=Report on the Settlement of the Kohat District in the Panjáb |date=1884 |publisher=Calcutta Central Press |language=en}}</ref>

The region had been primarily populated by [[Orakzai]] Pashtuns, who were then displaced from the west by the [[Bangash]] in the 14th-15th centuries, and [[Khattak]]s from the south.<ref name=":0" /> The Kohat region was likely firmly dominated by Bangash tribesmen by the early late 15th century following a decisive battle at nearby [[Alizai, Kurram|Alizai]],<ref name=":0" /> after which Bangash tribes settled in the fertile valleys and assimilated remaining indigenous inhabitants into the larger Bangash tribe, while Orakzai tribes were confined to the nearby hills.<ref name=":0" />

The first historical record of the city comes from the ''[[Baburnama]]'' autobiography of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]].<ref name=":0" /> After capturing Peshawar, Babur was reportedly told of vast riches in Kohat. He invaded and plundered Kohat in 1505,<ref name=":0"/> only to discover the tales of its wealth were exaggerated.<ref name=":0" /> After capturing Kohat, Babur's army marched towards Bangash country, where he defeated a band of tribesmen.<ref name=":0" />

=== Durrani period ===
[[File:Durrani prince tomb in kohat.JPG|thumb|A royal Durrani tomb near Kohat]]
During the [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|Persian Empire's invasion of the Mughal Empire]] in the 1730s and 1740s, Kohat escaped destruction as Emperor [[Nader Shah]]'s forces followed invasion routes north in the [[Valley of Peshawar|Peshawar Valley]].<ref name=":0" /> Following the departure of Persian forces, Kohat was absorbed into the [[Durrani Empire]] by 1747.<ref name=":0" />

Following the fall of [[Shah Shujah Durrani|Shah Shuja Durrani]] in 1810, Kohat was brought under control of the Durrani kingdom based in Peshawar and [[Kabul]], which leased lordship of the city to various chiefs.<ref name=":0" />  The first chief of Kohat was Mirza Girani, who was followed in succession until 1818 by Shakur Khan, and Sultan Muhammad.<ref name=":0" /> In 1818, Kohat came under the control of Samad Khan following the collapse of Durrani suzerainty,<ref name=":0" /> though the city then came under the influence of Pir Muhammad in 1827.<ref name=":0" />

=== Sikh period ===
[[Ranjit Singh]]'s armies marched to Peshawar in 1819.<ref name=":0" /> In 1834, Azim Khan was defeated by the Sikhs and the chiefs of Peshawar became tributaries of the Sikh Government. Kohat was captured by [[Sikh]] governor Avtar Singh Sandhanwalia in 1839,<ref name=":0" /> and became part of Ranjit Singh's [[Sikh Empire]], though Pir Muhammad was allowed to continue administering the region around Kohat.<ref name=":0" />

In 1840, the Sikhs abandoned Kohat, and Sultan Mohammed became ruler of Kohat. In 1848 during the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]], Colonel George Lawrence, the British Resident at [[Lahore]], sought refuge in Kohat, but was instead taken prisoner and handed to Sikh forces in Peshawar under Chattar Singh before being released. In 1849, Kohat and the rest of Punjab was formally annexed by the British.

=== British period ===
[[File:Tehsil gate.jpg|thumb|Kohat Tehsil gate in 1919]][[File:Ktrailway.jpg|thumb|Railway station in 1900]]
Following British victory over the Sikhs in 1848, Kohat came under British rule and was annexed in March 1849.<ref name=":0" /> Lieutenant Pollack was appointed as Kohat's first Assistant Commissioner.<ref name=":0" /> British authorities in [[Peshawar]] commenced construction of the [[Kohat Pass]] road in 1849,<ref name=":0" /> and completed it by 1850 despite violent opposition from local tribes.<ref name=":0" /> The pass was closed temporarily in 1853 after a quarrel arose among nearby tribes.<ref name=":0" /> The road which connected Kohat to [[Rawalpindi]] via [[Khushalgarh]] was of little trouble compared to the Kohat Pass road.<ref name=":0" />

Kohat remained largely peaceful during the [[Sepoy Mutiny of 1857]], and local Pashtun soldiers largely ignored calls for rebellion.<ref name=":0" /> The British established a [[Hill Station]] at [[Cherat]], just north of Kohat, in the 1860s. Kohat Pass road was closed on and off by British authorities for several more years on account of quarrels among local tribes, including in 1865 when it was closed for more than one and a half years.<ref name=":0" /> Armed skirmishes between British forces and Pashtun tribesmen continued on and off between the 1860s and 1870s. [[Kohat Cantonment]] was established by the British in 1874.<ref name=":0" /> Routes between Kohat and [[Bannu]] and [[Thall]] were frequently blockaded by [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazir]] tribesmen by 1880 that resulted in large clashes between the British and Wazirs.<ref name=":0" />

In 1924, [[1924 Kohat riots|Kohat was the scene of widespread communal rioting]] that resulted in a 21-day fast by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], known popularly as Mahatma Gandhi, as a plea for unity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi|author=Sankar Ghose|publisher=Allied Publishers|year=1991|isbn=978-81-7023-205-6}}</ref> During the [[1947 Kashmir War]], Pashtun tribesmen from around the region convened in Kohat before departing for [[Kashmir]] in hopes of capturing the territory for Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mcXVjswUrcC&q=kohat+history&pg=PA129|title=Roar of the Tiger - Illustrated History of Operations in Kashmir by 4th Battalion The Kumaon Regt in 1965 War|last=Singh|first=Sm Jasbir|date=2013-05-01|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-82652-03-8|language=en}}</ref>

=== Parks ===

==== Tanda Wildlife Park ====
Tanda Wildlife Park is located near Kohat city. The total area of the park is 2800 acres (11 km²), consisting of Tanda reservoir and its catchments in Kohat. This is the largest wildlife park of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. Its wonderfully rich and varied landscape supports a range of mammals and birds, both migratory and indigenous, as well as a few reptiles. Kohat is famous for guava.

The park is bounded by three different villages, Bar, Kaghazi, and Tanda Banda. The park is approachable by Hangu-kaghazi [[gravel road]], shahpur-Bar road which is 18&nbsp;km from Kohat.

The local people do not have any right of grazing, lopping or firewood collection as the ownership lies with the provincial government. The park area falls in the natural habitat of urial and chinkara, and also provides suitable habitat to hog deer. The urial is associated with scrub forest of Olea species and Accassia species. Urial were once abundant in the area but due to continuous habitat destruction these were disappeared from the area in the near past. The natural habitat of urial and chinkara lies in close proximity of human habitation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.khyberpakhtunkhwa.gov.pk/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi|title=Site Maintenance|website=www.khyberpakhtunkhwa.gov.pk}}</ref>

====Kotal Pheasantry====

==Transportation==
===Rail===
Construction of the [[Kohat Tehsil railway station]] and railway line was started in 1897, and was completed in 1902. The [[Kohat Cantonment railway station]] serves as the terminus for the [[Khushalgarh–Kohat–Thal Railway]] - which ceased onward narrow gauge (762&nbsp;mm or 2&nbsp;ft 6 in) railway service to Thall in 1991. Kohat is the terminus railway station of Kohat<ref>[http://www.ugo.cn/photo/PK/en/8745.htm kohat railway station, Photo-Pakistan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310015647/http://www.ugo.cn/photo/PK/en/8745.htm |date=2014-03-10 }}.

The Kohat Rail Service, suspended in 2013 due to unforeseen circumstances, caused immense hardship for the local population. Undeterred, President Saleem Altaf Advocate spearheaded a peaceful movement through Karwaan-E-Amal Kohat. Following a resilient 4-year struggle, the Kohat Rail Service was triumphantly restored in 2017. Today, millions of people in Kohat reap the benefits of this vital transportation link.
