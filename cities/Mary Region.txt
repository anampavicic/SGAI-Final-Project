'''Mary Region''' ({{langx|tk|Mary welaýaty}}) is one of five [[regions of Turkmenistan|provinces in Turkmenistan]]. It is located in the south-east of the country, bordering [[Afghanistan]]. Its capital is the city of [[Mary, Turkmenistan|Mary]]. Its area is {{convert|87150|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and population 1,613,386 (2022 census).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Turkmenistan: Regions, Major Cities & Towns - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/turkmenistan/ |access-date=2024-01-16 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref><ref name=yb2005>''Statistical Yearbook of Turkmenistan 2000–2004'', National Institute of State Statistics and Information of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat, 2005.</ref> The average population density is about 15 persons per square kilometer, but it reaches 150–200 per square kilometer in the most developed [[oases]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 2000, Mary Region accounted for 23% of Turkmenistan's population, 19% of the total number of employed, 26% of agricultural production (by value), and 21% of the country's total industrial production.<ref>''Social-economic situation of Turkmenistan in 2000'', National Institute of State Statistics and Information of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat, 2001, pp. 137–138 {{in lang|ru}}.</ref> The region's industries include [[natural gas]] extraction (the [[Galkynysh Gas Field]]), [[electric power]] generation, textiles, carpet weaving, chemical and food industry.

Agriculture in Mary Region is irrigated by the [[Qaraqum Canal|Karakum Canal]], which runs east to west through the center of the province, and by the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]], which runs south to north, entering the province from Afghanistan. While the northern portion of the province is within the Central Asian southern desert ecoregion, the southern portion of the province is characterized by a savanna of pistachio and desert sedges, classified as the Badkhiz-Karabil semi-desert by the World Wildlife Fund.<ref>{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=pa1306|name=Badkhiz-Karabil semi-desert|access-date=2012-08-05}}</ref>

Ancient [[Merv]], designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], is the main archeological attraction of Mary Province. This is one of the best-preserved oasis cities on the ancient [[Silk Road]].<ref>Bonneville, Patrick and Hemono, Philippe. 2006. The World Heritage. Bonneville Connection, Quebec</ref>

The capital of Mary Region is the city of [[Mary, Turkmenistan|Mary]], located at the intersection of Murghab River with the Karakum Canal. Other major cities are [[Baýramaly city|Baýramaly]] ({{langx|ru|Байрам-Али}}), Ýolöten (Iolotan, {{langx|ru|Иолотань}}), and [[Serhetabat]] ({{langx|ru|Серхетабад}}, formerly {{langx|tk|Guşgy}}, {{langx|ru|Кушка}}) on the border with Afghanistan.

===Prehistory===
[[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] finds support the probability of advanced civilizations in the area including finds associated with a society known to scholars as the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]] (BMAC) – near the modern city of [[Mary, Turkmenistan|Mary]], and at the [[Jeitun]] and [[Gonur Tepe]] archeological sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/886.pdf|title=State Historical and Cultural Park "Ancient Merv"|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|access-date=March 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkmenistanembassy.org/turkmen/history/history.html|title=History & Culture<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=turkmenistanembassy.org|access-date=March 18, 2018|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011110084224/http://www.turkmenistanembassy.org/turkmen/history/history.html|archive-date=November 10, 2001|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Founding of Merv===
[[Alexander the Great]] conquered the territory in the 4th century BC on his way to South Asia. In 330 BC, Alexander marched northward into Central Asia and founded the city of Alexandria Margiana ([[Merv]]) near the [[Murghab River]]. A busy [[Silk Road]] caravan route, connecting [[Tang dynasty]] China and the city of [[Baghdad]] (in modern Iraq), passed through Merv. The city of Merv was occupied by the lieutenants of the caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]], and was constituted as the capital of Khorasan. Using this city as their base, the Arabs, led by their commander [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]], brought under subjection [[Balkh]], [[Bokhara]], [[Fergana]] and [[Kashgaria]], and penetrated into China as far as the province of [[Gansu]] early in the 8th century.

Merv achieved some political spotlight in February 748 when [[Abu Muslim]] (d. 750) declared a new [[Abbasid]] dynasty at Merv, and set out from the city to conquer Iran and Iraq and establish a new capital at Baghdad. The goldsmith of Merv famously challenged Abu Muslim to do the right thing and not make war on fellow Muslims. The goldsmith was put to death.

In the latter part of the 8th century, Merv became obnoxious to Islam as the centre of heretical propaganda preached by al-Muqanna "The Veiled Prophet of Khorasan". Present Turkmenistan was ruled by [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] between 821 and 873. In 873, Arab rule in Central Asia came to an end due to the [[Saffarid]] conquest. During their dominion, Merv, like [[Samarkand]] and Bokhara, was one of the great schools of learning, and the celebrated historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]] studied in its libraries. Merv produced several scholars in various branches of knowledge, such as Islamic law, [[Hadith]], history, literature, and the like.

===Arrival of the Turkmen===
{{See also|Teke (Turkmen tribe)|Turkmens}}
In 1055 Seljuk forces entered [[Baghdad]], becoming masters of the Islamic heartlands and important patrons of Islamic institutions. Until these revolts, Turkmen tribesmen were an integral part of the Seljuk military forces. Turkmen migrated with their families and possessions on Seljuk campaigns into Azerbaijan and Anatolia, which began the Turkification of these areas. During this time, Turkmen also began to settle the area of present-day Turkmenistan. Prior to the Turkmen habitation, most of this desert had been uninhabited, while the more habitable areas along the Caspian Sea, [[Kopet Dag]] Mountains, [[Amu Darya]], and [[Murghab River]] ({{langx|tk|Murgap deryasy}}) were populated predominantly by Iranians. The city-state of [[Merv]] was an especially large sedentary and agricultural area, important as both a regional economic-cultural center and a transit hub on the [[Silk Road]].<ref name=lcweb>{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=Glenn E.|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/tmtoc.html|title=Turkmenistan: A Country Study|series=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|location=Washington|year=1996|oclc=45380435}}</ref> The last powerful Seljuk ruler, Sultan [[Sanjar]] (d. 1157), witnessed the fragmentation and destruction of the empire because of attacks by Turkmen and other tribes.<ref name=lcweb /> During the reign of Sultan Sanjar or Sinjar of the same house, in the middle of the 11th century, Merv was overrun by the Turkish tribes of the Ghuzz from beyond the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]]. It eventually passed under the sway of the rulers of [[Khwarezm]] (Khiva). After mixing with the settled peoples in today's Turkmenistan, the Oghuz living north of the Kopet Dag Mountains gradually became known as the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]].

=== Mongols and Timurids ===
In 1157, the Seljuk dynasty came to an end in the province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. The Turkic rulers of [[Khiva]] took control of the area of Turkmenistan, under the title of [[Khwarezmshah]]. In 1221, Central Asia suffered a disastrous invasion by [[Mongol]] warriors who swept across the region from their base in eastern Asia. Under their commander, [[Genghis Khan]], founder of the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Mongols]] conquered [[Khwarezm]] and burned the city of Merv to the ground. The Mongol leader ordered the massacre of Merv's inhabitants as well as the destruction of the province's farms and irrigation works, which effectively ended the Iranian dominance in urban areas and agricultural communities of Khwarezm. These areas were soon repopulated by the Turkmen who survived the invasion and had retreated northward to the plains of Kazakhstan or westward to the shores of the Caspian Sea. After the [[division of the Mongol Empire]], present Turkmenistan was passed to the [[Chagatai Khanate]], except the southernmost part belonged to [[Ilkhanate]].

===Khiva and the Persians===
The invasion of the Khan of Khiva, [[Abulghazi Bahadur|Abul Gazi Bahadur Khan]], from 1645 to 1663, caused some difficulties to the Turkmens, coupled with the impact of the drought that occurred at about the same period.  Most of the Turkmens within the khanate moved to [[Ahal Region|Ahal]], [[Atrek]], [[Murgap, Turkmenistan|Murgap]] and [[Tejen]]. Most of present-day Turkmenistan was divided between the Khanates of Khiva and Bukhara, except southernmost parts under Persian suzerainty. [[Nader Shah|Nader]] of Persia conquered the entire region in 1740, but after his assassination in 1747 Turkmen lands were recaptured by the Uzbek khanates of Khiva and Bukhara. During the 1830s, the [[Teke (Turkmen tribe)|Teke Turkmen]], then living on the Tejen River in today's Turkmen-Afghan borderlands, were forced by the Persians to migrate northward. Khiva contested the advance of the Tekes, but ultimately, by about 1856, the latter became the sovereign power of southern and southeastern parts of present Turkmenistan.

Lieutenant Colonel C.E. Stuart reported that in the 1830s the Teke tribe began to settle in the lower Murghab River delta near Merv, which, he said, they destroyed around 1855.  From here the Teke extended their reach to [[Serdar (city)|Kizil-Arvat]] (today's city of Serdar), ultimately splitting into the Ahal Teke, located between Kizil-Arvat and [https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/582668354 Gawars] (an area Stuart called "Daman-i-Kuh"), and the [[Mary, Turkmenistan|Merv]] (today Mary) Teke, mainly between the Tejen and Murghab Rivers.  [[Edmund O'Donovan]] described Merv as of 1881 as 
:...a heap of melancholy ruins.  There are remains of baths, and palaces, and ramparts crumbling around, with nothing living but snakes and jackals to be seen, or perhaps some wandering Turkoman looking out for his sheep...This is all that remains of Merv...<ref name=odonovan>{{cite book|title=The Country of the Turkomans|date=1977|publisher=Oguz Press and the Royal Geographical Society|place=London|isbn=0-905820-01-0|chapter=Chapter 15, ''Merv and Its Surroundings''| last=O'Donovan|first=Edmund|editor-first=Sir Duncan|editor-last=Cumming}}</ref>
O'Donovan also asserted that as of 1881 
: The Turkomans of Merv have only been twenty-six years in the oasis.  They formerly inhabited the district around [[Sarahs|Sarakhs]] on the upper part of the [[Tejen River|Tejend river]].  They were driven from there twenty-seven years ago by the Persians, who objected to the neighbourhood of persons so disagreeable as to insist in carrying off Persian men, their wives, and daughters, and selling them at 5''L'' per head in Bokhara.<ref name=odonovan />

===Russian Empire===
Following Russia's defeat of the combined Ahal and Merv Teke army at the [[Battle of Geok-Tepe]] in 1881, Russian forces sought to pacify and occupy the area of today's Mary Region. Merv was taken in 1884, followed by Kushka (today's [[Serhetabat]]) in 1885.  The latter precipitated the [[Panjdeh incident]] and very nearly a war between Russia and Great Britain, which feared Imperial Russia intended to push on through [[Afghanistan]] into [[India]]. A spur of the [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] was extended to [[Serhetabat|Kushka]], both to allow delivery and supply of troops guarding the border with Afghanistan, and to haul out cotton produced in the Murghab River valley.

===Soviet period===
Following the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] power was fully in place by 1924, when the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created. The name "Merv" was changed to "Mary" in 1937. The region initially was directly under control of the Turkmen SSR government, but in 1939 Mary ''oblast' '' ({{langx|ru|Mарыйская область}}, {{langx|tk|Mary oblasty}}) was created.  It was abolished in 1963, then re-established in 1970.<ref name=tkmenc>{{cite book|title=Туркменская Советская Социалистическая Республика|date=1984 |place=Ashgabat |publisher=Изд-во Чувашского обкома КПСС |article=Столица и области Туркменской ССР |page=486 |language=ru}}</ref>
