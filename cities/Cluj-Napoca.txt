==Etymology==

===Napoca===
On the site of the city was a [[List of ancient cities in Thrace and Dacia|pre-Roman settlement]] named ''Napoca''. After the AD 106 [[Roman Dacia|Roman conquest of the area]], the place was known as ''Municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napoca''. Possible etymologies for ''Napoca'' or ''Napuca'' include the names of some [[Dacian tribes]] such as the ''Naparis'' or ''Napaei'', the Greek term ''napos'' (νάπος), meaning "timbered valley" or the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European root]] ''*snā-p-'' ([[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch|Pokorny]] 971–972), "to flow, to swim, damp".<ref>Lukács 2005, p.14</ref>

===Cluj===

The first written mention of the city's current name – as a Royal Borough – was in 1213 under the [[Medieval Latin]] name ''Castrum Clus''.<ref name="Clujeanet-2">{{Cite web |title=O istorie inedită a Clujului – Cetatea coloniștilor sași |url=http://clujnet.com/romana/001_cluj_napoca/istorie/03-colonistii_sasi.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130171551/http://clujnet.com/romana/001_cluj_napoca/istorie/03-colonistii_sasi.htm |archive-date=30 January 2008 |access-date=2008-03-16 |publisher=ClujNet.com |language=ro}}</ref> Despite the fact that ''Clus'' as a county name was recorded in the 1173 document ''Thomas comes Clusiensis'',<ref name="Lazarovici et al-6">Lazarovici et al. 1997, p.32 (3.1 De la Napoca romană la Clujul medieval)</ref> it is believed that the county's designation derives from the name of the ''[[castrum]]'', which might have existed prior to its first mention in 1213, and not vice versa.<ref name="Lazarovici et al-6"/> With respect to the name of this camp, there are several hypotheses about its origin. It may represent a derivation from the [[Latin]] term ''clausa&nbsp;–&nbsp;clusa'', meaning "closed place", "strait", "ravine".<ref name="Lazarovici et al-6"/> Similar meanings are attributed to the [[Slavic languages|Slavic term]] ''kluč'', meaning "a [[Spring (hydrology)|key]]"<ref name="Lazarovici et al-6"/> and the German ''Klause&nbsp;–&nbsp;Kluse'' (meaning "mountain pass" or "[[weir]]").<ref name="Gaal-2000">{{Cite web |last=Gaal |first=György |date=19 July 2000 |title=Kolozsvári kronológia – Kolozsvár kétezer esztendeje dátumokban |url=http://www.szabadsag.ro/archivum/2000/0sep-19.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207090923/http://www.szabadsag.ro/archivum/2000/0sep-19.htm |archive-date=7 December 2008 |access-date=2008-03-15 |publisher=Szabadság |language=hu}}</ref> The Latin and Slavic names have been attributed to the valley that narrows or closes between hills just to the west of [[Mănăștur|Cluj-Mănăștur]].<ref name="Lazarovici et al-6"/> An alternative proposal relates the name of the city to its first magistrate, ''Miklus''&nbsp;–&nbsp;''Miklós'' / ''Kolos''.<ref name="Gaal-2000"/>

The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian form]] ''Kolozsvár'', first recorded in 1246 as ''Kulusuar'', underwent various [[phonetic change]]s over the years (''uar'' / ''vár'' means "castle" in Hungarian); the variant ''Koloswar'' first appears in a document from 1332.<ref name="Asztalos-2003">{{Cite web |last=Asztalos |first=Lajos |date=4 August 2003 |title=Kolozsvár neve |url=http://www.szabadsag.ro/archivum/2003/08/3aug-04.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207090427/http://www.szabadsag.ro/archivum/2003/08/3aug-04.htm |archive-date=7 December 2008 |access-date=2008-03-15 |publisher=Szabadság |language=hu}}</ref> Its [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] name ''Clusenburg''/''Clusenbvrg'' appeared in 1348, but from 1408 the form ''Clausenburg'' was used.<ref name="Asztalos-2003"/> The [[Romanian language|Romanian name]] of the city used to be spelled alternately as ''Cluj'' or ''Cluș'',<ref name="Szabó-2007">{{Cite web |last=Szabó |first=Attila m. |title=Dicționar de localități din Transilvania |url=http://dictionar.referinte.transindex.ro/index.php3?action=betu&betu=k&kezd=60&co=nemet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822094410/http://dictionar.referinte.transindex.ro/index.php3?action=betu&betu=k&kezd=60&co=nemet |archive-date=22 August 2010 |access-date=2008-03-15 |language=ro}}</ref> the latter being the case in [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s ''Poesis''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cluj-Napoca|Timeline of Cluj-Napoca}}

===Roman Empire===
[[File:Part of Tabula Peutingeriana centered around present day Transylvania.png|thumb|text-top|upright=1.5|Napoca on the [[Roman Dacia]] fragment of the 1st–4th century AD [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] (upper center){{sfn|Bunbury|1879|p=516}}]]
The [[Roman Empire]] conquered [[Dacia]] in AD 101 and 106, during the rule of [[Trajan]], and the Roman settlement Napoca, established about 106, is first recorded on a [[Milliarium of Aiton|milestone]] discovered in 1758 in the vicinity of the city.<ref name="Lazarovici et al-10">Lazarovici ''et al.'' 1997, pp. 202–03 (6.2 Cluj in the Old and Ancient Epochs)</ref> Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] granted Napoca the status of ''[[municipium]]'' as ''municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses''. Later, in the second century AD,<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p. 17 (2.7 Napoca romană)</ref> the city gained the status of a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' as ''Colonia Aurelia Napoca''. Napoca became a provincial capital of [[Dacia Porolissensis]] and thus the seat of a [[promagistrate|procurator]]. The ''colonia'' was evacuated in 274 by the Romans.<ref name="Lazarovici et al-10"/> There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter.<ref>Brubaker et al. 2006, p.89</ref>

After the 1848 revolution, an [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] regime was established, followed by a liberal regime that came to power in 1860. In this latter period, the government granted equal rights to the ethnic Romanians, but only briefly.

In the autumn of 1918, as World War I drew to a close, Cluj became a centre of revolutionary activity, headed by [[Amos Frâncu]].

===Climate===
Cluj-Napoca has a [[humid continental climate|warm-summer humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb''). The climate is influenced by the city's proximity to the [[Apuseni Mountains]], as well as by urbanisation. Some West-Atlantic influences are present during winter and autumn. Winter temperatures are often below {{convert|0|C|F|0}}, even though they rarely drop below {{convert|-10|C|F|0}}. On average, snow covers the ground for 65 days each winter.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mediu: Cluj-Napoca |url=http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/proiecte-dezbateri/Politici_comunitare_de_mediu.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125155551/http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/proiecte-dezbateri/Politici_comunitare_de_mediu.pdf |archive-date=25 January 2007 |access-date=2008-03-21 |publisher=Primăria Cluj-Napoca |language=ro}}</ref> In summer, the average temperature is approximately {{convert|20|C|F|0}}, despite the fact that temperatures sometimes reach {{convert|35|C|F|0}} in mid-summer in the city centre. There are infrequent yet heavy and often violent storms in summer. During spring and autumn, temperatures vary between {{convert|0|C|F|0}} to {{convert|22|C|F|0}}, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.

Because of the last years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Becaș, Făget, Zorilor South), but most of them are still construction sites.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2005 |title=Hotărâre privind propuneri de atribuire denumiri strazi si cartiere in municipiul Cluj-Napoca |url=http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/phcl/7-10-2005/27.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302004936/http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/phcl/7-10-2005/27.aspx |archive-date=2 March 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Cluj-Napoca City Hall |language=ro}}</ref> Beside these, there are some other building areas like ''Tineretului'', ''Lombului'' or ''Oser'', which are likely to become districts in the following years.<ref>{{Cite web |date=7 June 2007 |title=Emil Boc îl sfidează pe Tăriceanu |url=http://www.ftr.ro/emil-boc-il-sfideaza-pe-tariceanu-892.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729013944/http://www.ftr.ro/emil-boc-il-sfideaza-pe-tariceanu-892.php |archive-date=29 July 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Foaia Transilvană |language=ro}}</ref>

Additionally, as Cluj-Napoca is the capital of [[Cluj County]], the city hosts the palace of the prefecture, the headquarters of the [[county council]] (''consiliu județean'') and the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]], who is appointed by Romania's central government.<ref name="Parliament of Romania-2"/> The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the local level.<ref name="Parliament of Romania-2"/> Like all other local councils in Romania, the Cluj-Napoca local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population.<ref name="Parliament of Romania-2"/>

Cluj-Napoca is also the capital of the historical region of [[Transylvania]], a status that resonates to this day. Currently, the city is the largest in the [[Nord-Vest (development region)|Nord-Vest development region]], which is equivalent to [[NUTS-II]] regions in the [[European Union]] and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and regional development.

In order to counterbalance the political influence of Transylvania's Hungarian minority, nationalist Romanians in Transylvania founded the [[Party of Romanian National Unity]] (PUNR) at the beginnings of the 1990s; the party was present in the Romanian Parliament during the 1992–1996 legislature.<ref name="PUNR">{{Cite web |title=History of PUNR |url=http://www.punr.ro/istoric.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041014191152/http://www.punr.ro/istoric.htm |archive-date=14 October 2004 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Partidul Unității Națiunii Române |language=ro}}</ref> The party eventually moved its main offices to Bucharest and fell into decline as its leadership joined the ideologically similar [[Greater Romania Party|PRM]].<ref name="PUNR"/> In 2008, the ''Institute for Research on National Minorities'', subordinated to the [[Romanian Government]], opened its official headquarters in Cluj-Napoca.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 August 2007 |title=Institutul minorităților se înființează la Cluj |url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=1760 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321123616/http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=1760 |archive-date=21 March 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Ziua de Cluj |language=ro}}</ref>

Eleven hospitals function in the city, nine of which are run by the county and two (for oncology and cardiology) by the [[Ministry of Public Health (Romania)|health ministry]].

===Justice system===
Cluj-Napoca has a complex judicial organisation, as a consequence of its status of [[Cluj County|county]] capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of [[Dej]], [[Gherla]], [[Turda]], and [[Huedin]].<ref name="Parliament of Romania">{{Cite web |title=Law no. 92 / 4 August 1992 for the judicial organisation |url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=13169 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208230505/http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=13169 |archive-date=8 February 2007 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Parliament of Romania |language=ro}}</ref> Appeals from these tribunals' verdicts, and more serious cases, are directed to the Cluj Court of Appeals. The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals.<ref name="Parliament of Romania"/>

Cluj-Napoca has its own municipal police force, ''Poliția Municipiului Cluj-Napoca'', which is responsible for policing of crime within the whole city, and operates a number of special divisions. The Cluj-Napoca Police are headquartered on Decebal Street in the city centre (with a number of precincts throughout the city) and it is subordinated to the [[Romanian Police|County's Police Inspectorate]] on Traian Street.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Law no. 218 / 23 April 2002: Law on the organisation and work of the Romanian Police |url=http://www.politiaromana.ro/legea_politiei.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224033407/http://www.politiaromana.ro/legea_politiei.htm |archive-date=24 February 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Parliament of Romania |language=ro}}</ref> City Hall has its own community police force, ''Poliția Primăriei'', dealing with local community issues.

Also notorious was the case of serial killer [[Romulus Vereș]], "the man with the hammer"; during the 1970s, he was charged with five murders and several [[attempted murder]]s, but never imprisoned on [[Insanity defense|grounds of insanity]]: he had [[schizophrenia]], blaming the [[Devil]] for his actions. Instead, he was institutionalised in the Ștei psychiatric facility in 1976, following a three-year [[forensic]] investigation during which four thousand people were questioned. [[Urban myth]]s brought the number of victims up to two hundred women, though the actual number was much smaller. This confusion is probably explained by the lack of attention this case received, despite its magnitude, in the Communist press of the time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 February 2008 |title=Citește povestea celui mai temut criminal al Clujului: "Omul cu ciocanul" |url=http://www.clujeanul.ro/cluj/citeste-povestea-celui-mai-temut-criminal-al-clujului-omul-cu-ciocanul-2394295 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301111548/http://www.clujeanul.ro/cluj/citeste-povestea-celui-mai-temut-criminal-al-clujului-omul-cu-ciocanul-2394295 |archive-date=1 March 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Clujeanul |language=ro}}</ref>

Efforts made by local authorities in the Cluj-Napoca district at the end of the 1990s to reform the protection of [[children's rights]] and assistance for [[street children]] proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police).

In the modern era, Cluj's population experienced two phases of rapid growth, the first in the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist period]], when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people [[Urbanization|migrated from rural areas]] and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital.<ref>Brubaker et al. 2006, p.112</ref> About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on [[Net migration rate|net migration]] inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, [[natural increase]] was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.<ref name="Lazarovici et al-3" />

From the [[Middle Ages]] onwards, the city of Cluj has been a multicultural city with a diverse cultural and religious life. In 1930, the city was 26.7% Reformed, 22.6% Greek Catholic, 20.1% Roman Catholic, 13.4% Jewish, 11.8% Orthodox, 2.4% Lutheran and 2.1% Unitarian.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Cluj_religie_1930.jpg |title=Populația Statornică în 1930 După Religie |publisher=Institutul Central de Statistică |volume=2, Part 2 |page=588 |language=ro |access-date=2013-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625131120/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Cluj_religie_1930.jpg |archive-date=25 June 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Contributing factors for demographic shifts were the extermination<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 2006 |title=Cluj Children Survivors |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/Holocaust/0127_Cluj-survivors.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223124826/http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0127_Cluj-survivors.html |archive-date=23 December 2007 |access-date=2008-04-05 |publisher=JewishGen}}</ref> and emigration<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 2007 |title=Background Note: Romania |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35722.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604191232/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35722.htm |archive-date=4 June 2019 |access-date=2008-04-05 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}</ref> of the city's Jews, the outlawing of the Greek-Catholic Church (1948–89)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Boia, Lucian |url=https://archive.org/details/romaniareaktionb00boia |title=Romania: Borderland of Europe |last2=Christian, James |publisher=Reaktion |year=2001 |isbn=1-86189-103-2 |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/romaniareaktionb00boia/page/n151 150] |url-access=limited |name-list-style=amp}}</ref> and the gradual decline in the Hungarian population.

In Kolozsvár, however, the religious lines were blurred. Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania<ref name="Brubaker et al-4"/> and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory, many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations.

The [[Romani people in Romania|Roma]] form a sizable minority in contemporary Romania, and a small but visible presence in Cluj-Napoca: self-identifying Roma in the city comprise only 1 percent of the population; yet they are a familiar presence in and around the central market, selling flowers, used clothes, and tinware.<ref name="Brubaker et al-4"/> They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level; however, Cluj-Napoca, with its small Roma population, has not been a major focus of Roma ethno-political activity.<ref name="Brubaker et al-4"/>

Cluj-Napoca has a diverse and growing cultural scene, with cultural life exhibited in a number of fields, including the [[visual arts]], [[performing arts]] and [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]]. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably [[St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca|St. Michael's Church]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Băldescu |first=Irina |title=Transilvania Medievale: Le Citta Fondate Di Sibiu, Bistrița, Brașov, Cluj |publisher=Bonsignori |year=2005 |isbn=88-7597-371-7 |language=it}}</ref>

In terms of [[visual arts]], the city contains a number of galleries featuring both classical and contemporary Romanian art, as well as selected international works.

The [[Bánffy Palace|National Museum of Art]] is located in the former palace of the count György Bánffy, the most representative secular construction built in the [[Baroque]] style in [[Transylvania]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Palatul Bánffy |url=http://www.cluj4all.com/adrese/istorie,18/obiective-istorice,60/palatul-banffy-sec.-xviii,711/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106061512/http://www.cluj4all.com/adrese/istorie,18/obiective-istorice,60/palatul-banffy-sec.-xviii,711/ |archive-date=2007-11-06 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Cluj4all.com |language=ro}}</ref><ref>Lukács 2005, pp.83–5</ref><ref>Pascu 1957, p.63</ref> The museum features extensive collections of Romanian art, including works of artists like [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], [[Ștefan Luchian]] and [[Dimitrie Paciurea]], as well as some works of foreign artists like [[Károly Lotz]], [[Luca Giordano]], [[Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin]], [[Herri met de Bles]] and [[Claude Michel]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Official website of the National Museum of Art |url=http://www.macluj.ro/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118054156/http://www.macluj.ro/ |archive-date=18 January 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=National Museum of Art |language=ro}}</ref> and was nominated to be European Museum of the Year in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Muzeul Național de Artă din Cluj-Napoca |url=http://www.cimec.ro/Muzee/Cluj/cluj.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302155406/http://www.cimec.ro/Muzee/Cluj/Cluj.htm |archive-date=2 March 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=CIMEC (Institutul de Cultură Morală) |language=ro}}</ref>

The most notable of the city's other galleries is the ''Gallery of the Union of Plastic Artists''. Situated in the city centre, this gallery presents collections drawn from the contemporary arts scene. The Gallery of Folk Art includes traditional Romanian interior decoration artworks.

Historically, the city was one of the most important cultural and artistic centres in 16th-century Transylvania. The Renaissance workshop, formed in 1530 and strongly supported by the Transylvanian princes, served local and wider requirements: from the middle of the century onwards, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had [[Battle of Mohács|conquered]] central Hungary, it extended its activity throughout the new principality. Its style, the "Flower Renaissance", used a variety of plant ornament enriched with coats of arms, figures and inscriptions. It continued to be of great importance into the 18th century, and traces of it are still apparent in 20th-century vernacular art; Klausenburg was central to the long, anachronistic survival of the style, particularly among Hungarians.<ref name="Oxford University Press-2008"/>

==Architecture==
Cluj-Napoca's salient architecture is primarily [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. The modern era has also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the [[Mid-century modern|mid-century style]]. The mostly utilitarian Communist-era architecture is also present, although only to a certain extent, as Cluj-Napoca never faced a large [[systematization (Romania)|systematisation]] programme. Of late, the city has seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings, mainly constructed after 2000.<ref name="Ion Mincu">{{Cite web |title=Arhitectura perioadei moderne pe teritoriul României |url=http://www.iaim.ro/catedre/istorie_teorie_restaurare/note/APA/2-2-1-arh-mod-rom.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408202135/http://www.iaim.ro/catedre/istorie_teorie_restaurare/note/APA/2-2-1-arh-mod-rom.doc |archive-date=8 April 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher="Ion Mincu" Architecture University |language=ro |format=DOC}}</ref>

===Historical architecture===
[[File:Palatul BanffyCJ.JPG|thumb|[[Bánffy Palace]]]]
[[File:Palatul Széki, Cluj.jpg|thumb|[[Széki Palace, Cluj-Napoca|Széki Palace]]]]
The nucleus of the old city, an important cultural and commercial centre, used to be a military camp, attested in documents with the name "castrum Clus".

[[File:CatedralaSfMihail (32).JPG|thumb|left|[[Iuliu Maniu Street, Cluj-Napoca|Iuliu Maniu Street]]: construction of this symmetrical street was undertaken during the 19th century.]]

The oldest residence in Cluj-Napoca is the [[Matthias Corvinus House, Cluj-Napoca|Matthias Corvinus House]], originally a Gothic structure that bears Transylvanian [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] characteristics due to a later renovation.<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p.56 (3.2 Monumente medievale)</ref> Such changes feature on other Hungarian townspeople's residences, built from the mid-15th century mostly of stone and wood with a cellar, ground floor and upper storey, in the Late Gothic and Renaissance styles; although the late medieval houses have often been considerably altered, the street façades of the old town are mostly preserved.<ref name="Oxford University Press-2008">{{Cite web |year=2008 |title=Cluj-Napoca |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T018268 |access-date=2008-10-10 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> [[St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca|St. Michael's Church]], the oldest and most representative Gothic-style building in the country, dates back to the 14th century. The oldest of its sections is the altar, dedicated in 1390, while the newest part is the clock tower, which was built in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style (1860).<ref name="Lukács 2005-2"/>

As Renaissance styles survived late in the city, the appearance of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at the centre of the development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, but by the end of the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the ''[[Adoration of the Magi in art|Adoration of the Magi]]'' (1748–50) is the work of [[Franz Anton Maulbertsch]]. The [[Cluj-Napoca Piarists' Church|earliest two-towered Baroque church]] was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of [[Košice]] and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town.<ref name="Oxford University Press-2008"/> The Baroque [[Bánffy Palace]] (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in the appearance of the principal façade.<ref name="Ion Mincu"/>

Both [[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|Avram Iancu]] and [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|Unrii Squares]] feature ensembles of [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] and [[baroque]]–[[rococo]] architecture, including the [[Palace of Justice, Cluj-Napoca|Palace of Justice]],<ref name="Cluj Tribunal"/> the [[Cluj-Napoca National Theatre|Theatre]],<ref name="Clujonline"/> the [[Iuliu Maniu Street, Cluj-Napoca|Iuliu Maniu symmetrical street]],<ref name="Lazarovici et al-5"/> and the New York Palace, among others.<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 February 2008 |title=Cum va arăta viitorul "Conti" |url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=9446 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113214106/http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=9446 |archive-date=13 January 2013 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Ziua de Cluj |language=ro}}</ref> In the 19th century many houses were built in the Neo-classical, Romantic and Eclectic styles. Also dating to that period are the [[Church with the Two Towers|two-towered Neo-classical Calvinist church]] (1829–50), its new college building of 1801, and the City Hall (1843–46) in the marketplace, by [[Antal Kagerbauer]].<ref name="Oxford University Press-2008"/>

The banks of the Someșul Mic also feature a wide variety of such old buildings. The end of the 19th century brought a building ensemble that fastens the corners of the oldest bridge over the river, at the north end of the [[Regele Ferdinand Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Regele Ferdinand Avenue]]. The Berde, Babos, Elian, Urania, and [[Széki Palace, Cluj-Napoca|Széki]] palaces consist of a mixture of Baroque, Renaissance and Gothic styles, following the [[Art Nouveau]]/Secession and Revival specifics.<ref>Alicu et al. 1995, p.30</ref>
[[File:Canalul Morilor, Cluj-Napoca.JPG|thumb|right|The 17th century Canalul Morii]]
In the 2000s, the old city centre underwent extensive restoration works, meant to convert much of it into a pedestrian area, including [[Eroilor Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Bulevardul Eroilor]], [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|Unirii Square]] and other smaller streets.<ref>{{Cite news |date=14 June 2007 |title=Schimbarea la față a centrului Clujului |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/a98147/schimbarea-la-fata-a-centrului-clujului.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228061239/http://www.romanialibera.ro/a98147/schimbarea-la-fata-a-centrului-clujului.html |archive-date=28 February 2017 |access-date=2008-03-12 |work=România Liberă |language=ro}}</ref> In some residential areas of the city, particularly the high-income southern areas, like ''Andrei Mureșanu'' or ''Strada Republicii'', there are many [[fin-de-siecle|turn-of-the-century]] villas.

===Modern and Communist architecture===

[[File:Blocks Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|Blocks of flats in central Cluj-Napoca]]

Part of Cluj-Napoca's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]], when historical architecture was replaced with "more efficient" high-density apartment blocks. Nicolae Ceaușescu's project of [[Systematization (Romania)|systematisation]] did not really affect the heart of the city, instead reaching the marginal, shoddily built districts surrounding it.<ref name="Ion Mincu"/>

Still, the centre hosts some examples of modern architecture dating back to the Communist era. The Hungarian Theatre building was erected at the beginning of the 20th century, but underwent an avant-garde renovation in 1961, when it acquired a [[modernist architecture|modernist style of architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Detailed technical description |url=http://www.huntheater.ro/oldal.php?soid=9&mm=11&sl=7 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115093329/http://www.huntheater.ro/oldal.php?soid=9&mm=11&sl=7 |archive-date=15 January 2009 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=[[Hungarian Theatre of Cluj]]}}</ref> Another example of modernist architectural art is ''Palatul Telefoanelor'', situated in the vicinity of [[Michael the Brave|Mihai Viteazul]] Square, an area that also features a complex of large apartment buildings.

Some outer districts, especially [[Mănăștur]], and to a certain extent [[Gheorgheni, Cluj-Napoca|Gheorgheni]] and [[Grigorescu, Cluj-Napoca|Grigorescu]], consist mainly of such large apartment ensembles.<ref name="Ion Mincu"/>

Since 1989, modern skyscrapers and glass-fronted buildings have altered the skyline of Cluj-Napoca. Buildings from this time are mostly made out of glass and steel, and are usually high-rise. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the [[Iulius Mall Cluj|Iulius Mall]]), office buildings and bank headquarters. Of this last, regional headquarters of the [[Banca Română pentru Dezvoltare]] is the tallest office building in Cluj-Napoca, with {{convert|50|m|ft}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tallest High-rise Buildings in Countries: Europe: Romania |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/co/?id=100136 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218051431/http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/co/?id=100136 |archive-date=18 February 2007 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Emporis}}</ref> Its twelve storeys were completed in 1997 after 4&nbsp;years of work and house offices for the bank and for divisions of several other companies, including insurance and oil companies.

Another [[Architecture|architecturally]] interesting building is the so-called "Clădirea biscuite" (''the biscuit building''). This building was supposed to house the local headquarters of the Banca Agricolă (Agricultural Bank), but entered in the custody of the city due to the failure of that bank in the 1990s and its subsequent purchase by the [[Raiffeisen Romania|Raiffeisen Bank]], to be eventually converted in an office building.<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 December 2006 |title=Emil Boc inventeaza "tivul la Biscuit" |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1711762-emil-boc-inventeaza-tivul-biscuit-city-business-center-plateste-primariei-cluj-napoca-parcare-care-nu-are.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521110834/http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1711762-emil-boc-inventeaza-tivul-biscuit-city-business-center-plateste-primariei-cluj-napoca-parcare-care-nu-are.htm |archive-date=21 May 2009 |access-date=2008-03-17 |publisher=Romania liberă.

The headquarters of [[Banca Transilvania]], at the intersection of [[Regele Ferdinand Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Regele Ferdinand Avenue]] and Barițiu Street, is also a large contemporary building and was originally constructed to host the regional offices of [[Romtelecom]], the public phone company, but was later sold to the bank.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pop |first=Doru |date=26 April 2007 |title=BT spends another 7&nbsp;m euros on headquarters in Cluj |url=http://www.zf.ro/articol_121977/bt_spends_another_7m_euros_on_headquarters_in_cluj.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429032807/http://www.zf.ro/articol_121977/bt_spends_another_7m_euros_on_headquarters_in_cluj.html |archive-date=29 April 2007 |access-date=2008-03-17 |newspaper=[[Ziarul Financiar]]}}</ref>

==Transport==
Cluj-Napoca has a complex system of regional transportation, providing road, air and rail connections to major cities in Romania and Europe. It also features a public transportation system consisting of bus, trolleybus and tram lines.

===Road===
Cluj-Napoca is an important node in the [[International E-road network|European road network]], being on three different European routes ([[European route E60|E60]], [[European route E81|E81]] and [[European route E576|E576]]). At a [[Roads in Romania|national level]], Cluj-Napoca is located on three different main national roads: [[DN1]], DN1C and DN1F.

===Rail===
[[Cluj-Napoca railway station|Cluj-Napoca Rail Station]], located about {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the city centre, is situated on the [[Căile Ferate Române|CFR-Romanian Railways]] Main Line 300 ([[Bucharest]] – [[Oradea]] – Romanian Western Border) and on Line 401 (Cluj-Napoca – [[Dej]]). CFR provides direct rail connections to all the major Romanian cities and to [[Budapest]]. The rail station is very well connected to all parts of the city by the trams, [[trolleybus]]es and buses of the local public transport company, CTP.

[[File:Cluj-Napoca, PESA 82, 2012.06.09 (2).jpg|thumb|A [[Pesa 120Na|PESA Swing]] tram on Splaiul Independenței]]
The city is also served by two other secondary rail stations, the ''Little Station'' (''Gara Mică''), which is technically part of and situated immediately near the main station, and ''Cluj-Napoca East'' (''Est''). There is also a cargo station, ''Halta "Clujana"''.

===Public transport===
[[Compania de Transport Public Cluj-Napoca|CTP]], the local public transport company, runs an extensive {{convert|321|km|mi}} public transport network within the city using 3 tram lines, 6 [[trolleybus]] lines and 21 bus routes.<ref name="Cluj-Napoca City Hall"/> Transport in the Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area is also covered by a number of private bus companies, such as Fany and MV Trans 2007, providing connections to neighboring towns and villages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vasile Racovițan |date=1 July 2008 |title=Curse private, prețuri ca la stat |url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=14080 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113132707/http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=14080 |archive-date=13 January 2013 |access-date=2009-07-03 |publisher=Ziua de Cluj |language=ro}}</ref>

====Trams====
The local transportation company, CTP, manages a tram line that runs through the city. Planned modernisation will involve the installation of new rail tracks and the separation of the tram route from road traffic. This will bring a number of advantages, including vibration and shock reduction, a substantial noise decrease, long use expectancy and higher [[Mass transit|transit]] speed – {{convert|60|to|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 January 2007 |title=Tramvaiul clujean circulă expirat |url=http://www.ftr.ro/index.php?cmd=d&id=1589 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212002628/http://www.ftr.ro/index.php?cmd=d&id=1589 |archive-date=12 February 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Foaia Transilvană |language=ro}}</ref> The route will undergo major alteration on Horea Street, between the [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the central rail station, a rather problematic area.

==Culture and media==
Cluj-Napoca is an important centre for [[Transylvania]]n mass media, since it is the headquarters of all regional television networks, newspapers and radio stations. The largest daily newspapers published in [[Bucharest]] are usually reissued from Cluj-Napoca in a regional version, covering Transylvanian issues. Such newspapers include ''[[România Liberă]]'', ''[[Gardianul]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 March 2008 |title=Cotidianul național Gardianul își lansează ediție regională |url=http://www.realitateacluj.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=642:GARDIANUL-REGIONAL---Cotidianul-național-Gardianul-își-lansează-ediție-regioanală_2008-04-15-03-19-55&catid=12:social&Itemid=13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080503031822/http://www.realitateacluj.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=642:GARDIANUL-REGIONAL---Cotidianul-na%C5%A3ional-Gardianul-%C3%AE%C5%9Fi-lanseaz%C4%83-edi%C5%A3ie-regioanal%C4%83_2008-04-15-03-19-55&catid=12:social&Itemid=13 |archive-date=3 May 2008 |access-date=2008-03-15 |publisher=Realitatea Cluj |language=ro}}</ref> ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', ''[[ProSport]]'' and ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]''.

Apart from the regional editions, which are distributed throughout [[Transylvania]], the national newspaper ''[[Ziua]]'' also runs a local franchise, ''Ziua de Cluj'', that acts as a local daily, available only within city limits. Cluj-Napoca also boasts other newspapers of local interest, like ''[[Făclia]]'' and ''[[Monitorul de Cluj]]'', as well as two free dailies, ''[[Informația Cluj]]'' and ''[[Cluj Expres]]''. ''[[Clujeanul]]'', the first of a series of local weeklies edited by the media trust [[Central European Media Enterprises|CME]], is one of the largest newspapers in Transylvania, with an audience of 53,000 readers per edition.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 December 2007 |title=Clujeanul își schimbă înfățișarea |url=http://old.clujeanul.ro/cotidian/nocache/articol/Cluj/CLUJEANUL_isi_schimba_infatisarea.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080127170826/http://old.clujeanul.ro/cotidian/nocache/articol/Cluj/CLUJEANUL_isi_schimba_infatisarea.html |archive-date=27 January 2008 |access-date=2008-03-12 |publisher=Clujeanul |language=ro}}</ref> This weekly has a daily online version, entitled ''Clujeanul, ediție online'', updated on a real-time basis. Cluj-Napoca is also the centre of the Romanian [[Hungarian language]] press. The city hosts the editorial offices of the two largest newspapers of this kind, ''[[Krónika]]'' and ''[[Szabadság]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |title=Media statistics for newspapers in Romania |url=http://www.mediaromania.ro/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313214129/http://www.mediaromania.ro/ |archive-date=13 March 2008 |access-date=2008-03-13 |publisher=Mediaromania.ro |language=ro}}</ref> as well as those of the magazines ''[[Erdélyi Napló]]'' and ''[[Korunk]]''. ''[[Săptămâna Clujeană]]'' is an economic weekly published in the city, that also issues two magazines on successful local people and companies (''Oameni de Succes'' and ''Companii de Succes'') every year, while ''[[Piața A-Z]]'' is a newspaper for announcements and advertisements distributed throughout Transylvania. Cluj had an active press in the interwar period as well: publications included the [[Zionism|Zionist]] newspaper ''[[Új Kelet]]'', the official party organs ''Keleti Újság'' (for the [[Magyar Party (Romania)|Magyar Party]]) and ''Patria'' (for the [[National Peasants' Party]]);<ref>{{Cite book |last=Forter |first=Norman |url=https://archive.org/details/roumanianhandboo00norm/page/29 |title=The Roumanian Handbook |last2=Rostovsky, Demeter |publisher=Ayer Publishing |year=1971 |isbn=0-405-02747-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/roumanianhandboo00norm/page/29 29] |url-access=registration}}</ref> and the nationalist ''Conștiința Românească'' and ''Țara Noastră'', the latter a magazine directed by [[Octavian Goga]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Blinkhorn |first=Martin |title=Fascists and Conservatives |publisher=Routledge |year=1990 |isbn=0-04-940087-8 |page=230}}</ref> Under Communism, publications included the socio-political and literary magazines ''Tribuna'', ''Steaua'', ''Utunk'', ''Korunk'', ''Napsugár'' and ''Előre'' as well as the regional Communist party daily organs ''Făclia'' and ''Igazság'' and the trilingual student magazine ''Echinox''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Romanian Academy |title=Dicționar enciclopedic român |publisher=Academia Republicii Populare Române |year=1962–66 |volume=1 |page=673}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Reviste literare |url=http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna104.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029030611/http://revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna104.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2007 |access-date=2008-09-11 |website=Tribuna |language=ro}}</ref>

Among the local television stations in the city, ''[[TVR Cluj]]'' (public) and ''[[One TV (Romania)|One TV]]'' (private) broadcast regionally, while the others are restricted to the metropolitan area. ''Napoca Cable Network'' is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports in addition to the national programming. This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for ''[[Radio Cluj]]'', ''[[Radio Impuls]]'' and the Hungarian-language ''[[Paprika Rádió]]'', all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. ''Casa Radio'', situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: [[Palatul Telefoanelor, Cluj-Napoca|Palatul Telefoanelor]] ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Magazines published in Cluj-Napoca include ''HR Journal'', a publication discussing human resources issues, ''[[J'Adore (magazine)|J'Adore]]'', a local shopping magazine that is also franchised in Bucharest, ''Maximum Rock Magazine'', dealing with the rock music industry, ''RDV'', a national hunting publication and ''Cluj-Napoca WWW'', an English-language magazine designed for tourists. Cultural and social events as well as all other entertainment sources are the leading subjects of such magazines as ''[[Șapte Seri]]'' and ''CJ24FUN''.

In the early 20th century, film production in Kolozsvár, led by [[Jenő Janovics]], was the chief alternative to Budapest.<ref name="Balogh"/> The first film made in the city, in association with the Parisian producer [[Pathé]], was ''Sárga csikó'' ("Yellow Foal", 1912), based on a popular "peasant drama". ''Yellow Foal'' became the first worldwide Hungarian success, distributed abroad under the title ''The Secret of the Blind Man'': 137 prints were sold internationally and the movie was even screened in Japan.<ref name="Balogh"/>

The first artistically prestigious film in the annals of Hungarian cinematography was also produced on this site, based on a national classic, ''[[Bánk bán]]'' (1914), a tragedy written by [[József Katona]].<ref name="Balogh"/>

Briefly, it returned to Cluj in the first half of the 1940s, when the city came back under Hungarian administration, but it was again relocated in Szeged, following the reincorporation of Cluj into Romanian territory. The Romanian branch acquired the name ''Babeș''; a Hungarian university, ''Bolyai'', was established in 1945, and the two were merged in 1959. The city also hosts nine other universities, among them the [[Technical University of Cluj-Napoca|Technical University]], the [[Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy]], the [[University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Cluj-Napoca]] (USAMV), the [[Art and Design University of Cluj-Napoca|University of Arts and Design]], the [[Gheorghe Dima Music Academy]] and other private universities and educational institutes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

a.{{note label|a|a|none}} The engraving, dating back to 1617, was executed by Georg Houfnagel after the painting of Egidius van der Rye (the original was done in the workshop of Braun and Hagenberg).

b.{{note label|b|b|none}} After the declaration of the union between the 1918–1920 period an exodus of Hungarian inhabitants occurred. Also, the city grew and many people moved in from the surrounding area and Cluj County as a whole, populated largely by Romanians.

c.{{note label|c|c|none}} In August 1940, as the second Vienna Award transferred the northern half of Transylvania to Hungary, many Hungarians and Romanians chose to leave or were exiled. After some ethnic Hungarians groups considered unreliable or insecure were sacked/expelled from Southern-Transylvania, the Hungarian officials also regularly expelled some Romanian groups from Northern-Transylvania.<ref>A történelem tanúi – Erdély – bevonulás 1940 p 56. - The witnesses of history – Transylvania – Entry 1940 p. 56. - {{ISBN|978-963-251-473-4}}</ref>

d.{{note label|d|d|none}} The 1941 Hungarian census is considered unreliable by most historians. In 1941, Cluj had 16,763 Jews. They were forced into ghettos in 1944 by the Hungarian authorities and deported to Auschwitz in May–June 1944.

e.{{note label|e|e|none}} In the 1960s a determined policy of industrialisation was initiated. Many people from the surrounding rural areas (largely Romanian) moved into the city, giving Cluj a Romanian majority.

f.{{note label|f|f|none}} Data refer to those for whom ethnicity is available, and do not include the 23,165 individuals (7.1% of the city's population) for whom such data are unavailable.
