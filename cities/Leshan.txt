As of the 2020 census, its population was 3,160,168, of whom 1,236,188 lived in the built-up metro area made of Shizhong (downtown), Wutongqiao, Shawan and Jinkouhe districts. A historical and cultural city, Leshan is famous for world heritage sites [[Mount Emei|Emei Mountain]] and [[Leshan Giant Buddha|Leshan Buddha]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mount Emei Scenic Area, including Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/779/ |access-date=2024-09-12 |website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref> It is also a regional center in the southern part of the Chengdu Economic Zone, serving as a transportation hub and port city in southwestern China.

==History==
Leshan has a long history, with written records tracing back to around 700 BC during the Kai Ming dynasty of the [[Shu (kingdom)|Shu Kingdom]]. Around the early [[Spring and Autumn period]], the [[Ba (state)|Ba people]], led by Kai Ming Bie Ling, migrated from western [[Hubei]] and settled at the confluence of the three rivers in what is now Leshan, including present-day Fengzhouba and the Dadu River. They established a tribal center. From the Qin and Han dynasties through to the Wei and Jin dynasties, the central government set up Nan'an County, laying the foundation for the present-day Leshan region.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=乐山简史 |url=https://www.leshan.gov.cn/wwwphp/sdzb/dqsj/lejs/index.html#p=30 |access-date=2024-09-12 |website=www.leshan.gov.cn |language=en}}</ref>

After the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] unification of China, Leshan was part of Meishan Prefecture (''jun''). In the third year of the Kaihuang reign (583 AD) of the Sui dynasty, the prefecture system was changed to a two-tier system of  state (''zhou)'' and counties. During the Tang dynasty's Zhenguan reign, Leshan became part of Jiazhou. In the Northern Song's Chongning reign, Leshan belonged to Jiading Prefecture, which administered five counties. During the reign of Emperor Ningzong of the Southern Song, Jiazhou was elevated to a prefecture and renamed Jiading Prefecture, marking the first use of the name "Jiading." During the Song and Yuan dynasties, Leshan's status rose from a prefecture to a province (''lu''), becoming the third-largest city in Sichuan, after Chengdu and Chongqing. In the twelfth year of Emperor Yongzheng's reign (1734 AD) of the Qing dynasty, Jiading Prefecture was established again.<ref name=":0" />

In the early years of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], from 1912 to 1917, Leshan was restructured into a county under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan Provincial Governor's Office. After [[Yuan Shikai]]'s death, Sichuan broke away from central authority; by 1918, Xiong Kewu took control of Sichuan, implementing the "Defense Zone System," which decentralized military, political, financial, and tax powers to local garrisons, leading to warlordism and prolonged unrest in the region for 18 years. During this time, Leshan was successively controlled by Chen Hongfan, [[Liu Wenhui]], and [[Liu Xiang (warlord)|Liu Xiang]], with local officials appointed by the stationed troops.<ref name=":0" />

After the [[Mukden incident|Mukden Incident]], the [[Nationalist government]] relocated the treasures from the [[Forbidden City]], Beijing to Shanghai, then Nanjing, and a significant portion eventually ended up in Leshan, including Emei and Angu, while the rest of them stored in Baxian (now [[Banan, Chongqing]]). The Forbidden City artifacts were stored in Leshan from July 1939, when the first batch arrived, until March 1947, when the last batch was transported out.<ref>{{Cite web |last=www.fractal-technology.com |title=故宫文物南迁史料馆 |url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/topic/move_south/index.html |access-date=2024-09-12 |website=故宫博物院}}</ref> In addition, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[Wuhan University]] and Jiangsu Sericulture College moved to Leshan, [[Sichuan University]] to Mount Emei, National Central Academy of Arts and Crafts was established at Renjiaba in Leshan, and Fuxing Academy was founded at Wuyou Temple in Leshan. Wuhan University left Leshan in June 1946.<ref name=":0" />

After the founding of the People's Republic, some of the area of Leshan was ceded to [[Emeishan city]] in 1958.<ref name="historyofthenameofLeshan">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnepaper.com/sjdsb/html/2013-05/18/content_10_3.htm|script-title=zh: 乐山老县名考（十）：乐山县|date=18 May 2013|access-date=11 March 2019|script-work=zh:三江都市报|language=zh-cn}}</ref> Until 1978, Leshan had three districts of Shizhong (means downtown), Wutongqiao (literally ''5-"tong"-bridge'') and Shawan (literally ''sand bay'').<ref name="prefecture-levelLeshan" /> In 1978, Leshan as a [[county-level city]] was formed.<ref name="historyofthenameofLeshan" /> In 1985, Leshan became a [[prefecture-level city]], with Emeishan and other county level cities under the administration of Leshan.<ref name="prefecture-levelLeshan">{{cite journal|url=http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/shuju/1985/gwyb198510.pdf|script-title=zh:國務院關於同意四川省撤銷樂山地區實行市管縣給四川省人民政府的批覆|date=20 April 1985|page=286 |publisher=[[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]|volume=1985|issue=10|language=zh-cn|access-date=11 March 2019 |journal=中华人民共和国国务院公报 [People's Republic of China State Council Gazette]}}</ref>

=== Dialect ===
The [[Leshan dialect]] is distinct among the dialects in Sichuan province for retaining the entering tone, the fourth of the four tones in classical Chinese pronunciation, which most Sichuan dialects and Mandarin no longer uses. Unlike other Sichuan dialects, most of which are mutually understandable, the Leshan dialect is difficult for other Sichuan people to understand.
