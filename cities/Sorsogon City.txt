'''Sorsogon City''' is the most populous city in the province, third most populous city in the entire Bicol Region and one of the leading cities in urbanization and most promising city in terms of development. 

The component city was established on the year of 2000, from the merger of Bacon and '''Sorsogon''' municipalities.<ref name="CorpusJuris-RA8806">{{cite web|title=R.A. No. 8806: An Act Creating the City of Sorsogon by Merging the Municipalities of Bacon and Sorsogon in the Province of Sorsogon and Appropriating Funds Therefor|url=https://thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-8806.php|website=The Corpus Juris|access-date=July 27, 2019|language=en|date=August 16, 2000}}</ref> The city's total population spread across [[List of barangays in Sorsogon City|64 barangays]].

==History==
Evidence of human habitation come from 3,000-year-old remains in a cave in Bacon and ancient burial sites dug upstream of Sorsogon rivers. Spanish missionaries came upon settlements in both sites when they arrived in the 1600s. Moro pirates had already frequented the territorial waters before the arrival of the Spanish missions.

Bacon was established as a ''visita'' of [[Casiguran, Sorsogon|Casiguran]] while Sorsogon, originally in Sitio Pocdol in Capuy, was then established as a visita of Bacon. Sorsogon then became an independent, full-fledged parish in 1628 due to an increase in population. The two parishes later became civilian political units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philippinescities.com/sorsogon-city-sorsogon/|title=Sorsogon City History &#124; Tourist Spots, Language and Festivals &#124; Philippines Cities}}</ref>

The Pueblo Civil de Bacon was established in 1754, with Juan Elias as its first gobernadorcillo. Sorsogon became an independent pueblo in 1864. Both Bacon and Sorsogon were under the territorial jurisdiction of the province of Albay until the establishment of the independent province of [[Sorsogon]] on October 17, 1894.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sorsogoncity.gov.ph/?page_id=48|title=Basic profile &#124; SORSOGON CITY}}</ref>

In 1951, Sorsogon was made the center of the episcopal see of the then newly established [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sorsogon]] comprising the Sorsogon and Masbate provinces, with the [[Sorsogon Cathedral|Saints Peter and Paul Parish Church]] in the town of Sorsogon as the designated [[cathedral]].<ref name="gct">{{cite web |title=Sts.
