[[File:Spanish Colonial Architecture-- Iquique.jpg|thumb]]
'''Iquique''' ({{IPA|es|iˈkike}}) is a port [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in northern [[Chile]], capital of both the [[Iquique Province]] and [[Tarapacá Region]]. It lies on the [[Pacific coast]], west of the [[Pampa del Tamarugal]], which is part of the [[Atacama Desert]]. It has a population of 191,468 according to the 2017 census.<ref name="INE"/> It is also the main commune of [[Greater Iquique]]. The city developed during the heyday of the [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] mining in the Atacama Desert in the 19th century. Once a Peruvian city with a large Chilean population, it was conquered by Chile in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883). Today it is one of only two [[free port]]s of Chile, the other one being [[Punta Arenas]], in the country's far south.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Although the city was founded in the 16th century, there is evidence of habitation in the area by the [[Changos|Chango]] people as early as 7,000 BC. During colonial times, Iquique was part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] as much of South America was at the time, and remained part of [[Peru]]vian territory until the end of the 19th century. Iquique's early development was due in large part to the discovery of mineral riches, particularly the presence of large deposits of [[sodium nitrate]] in the [[Atacama Desert]] (then part of Peruvian territory) ; and guano.<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2556090]</ref>

In July 1835, [[Charles Darwin]], during his voyage on the ''Beagle'', traveled to Iquique and described it as a town "very much in want of everyday necessities, such as water and firewood". These necessities had to be brought in from considerable distances. Darwin also visited the [[saltpetre works]].

The city has been devastated by several earthquakes, including the [[1868 Arica earthquake]], the [[1877 Iquique earthquake]], and the [[2005 Tarapacá earthquake]]. The [[2014 Iquique earthquake]] occurred with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 8.2 on April 1, 2014.

[[File:Combate Naval Iquique-Thomas Somerscales.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Iquique|Naval Battle of Iquique]] during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1884).]]
[[Atacama border dispute|Territorial disputes]] between Bolivia and Chile triggered the [[War of the Pacific]] in 1879. The [[Battle of Iquique]] was fought in the harbor of Iquique on May 21, 1879, now commemorated as [[Navy Day]], an annual [[Public holidays in Chile|public holiday in Chile]]. The outcome of the war gave Chile this portion of the Peruvian territory.

Over the years there was substantial emigration from other parts of Chile to this area which was called the ''Norte Grande''. In subsequent years the further exportation of Chilean saltpetre (mainly to European countries) significantly helped in the development of the city, attracting foreigners and rapidly expanding housing projects.

In December 1907, the city was marred by the [[Santa María de Iquique Massacre]] when the [[Chilean Army]], under the command of Gen. [[Roberto Silva Renard]], opened fire on thousands of saltpetre miners, and their wives and children, who assembled inside the Santa María School. The workers had marched into town to protest their working conditions and wages. Somewhere between 500 and 2,000 people were killed. The folk group [[Quilapayún]] recorded an album in remembrance of the event ([[Cantata Santa María de Iquique]]) in 1970. In December 2007 a series of cultural and ceremonial activities were planned, culminating in the week between December 14 to 21, to commemorate the centenary year of the massacre.

Mars 96 was launched by Russia in 1996, but failed to leave the Earth orbit, and re-entered the atmosphere a few hours later. The two RTGs onboard carried 200 g of plutonium in total and are assumed to have survived the re-entry as they were designed to do. They are thought to now lie somewhere in a northeast-southwest running oval {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, which is centred {{convert|32|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Iquique, Chile.<ref name="Ref_q">[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/text/mars96_timeline.txt Mars 96 timeline], NASA</ref>

Prior to becoming Chilean territory, Iquique was home to some of the greatest Peruvian heroes, namely [[Alfonso Ugarte]] (who was elected mayor in 1876), [[Ramón Zavala]], a rich saltpetre entrepreneur; [[Guillermo Billinghurst]], later President of Peru (who after being overthrown in 1914 came to Iquique – then already under Chilean rule – to live out his last years), and [[Ramón Castilla]], thrice president of Peru, who was born in [[San Lorenzo de Tarapacá]] and died in the Desert of Tiviliche, [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá]], who lived in Iquique during his mandate as Governor of Tarapacá in 1825.

==Governance==
As a commune, Iquique is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an [[alcalde]] who is directly elected every four years. The 2012–2016 alcalde is Jorge Soria.<ref name="Official"/>

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Iquique is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Marta Isasi ([[Independent (politician)|Ind.]]) and Hugo Gutiérrez ([[Communist Party of Chile|PC]]) as part of the 2nd electoral district, which includes the entire [[Tarapacá Region]]. The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by [[José Miguel Insulza]] (PS, 2018–2026) and José Durana (UDI, 2018–2026) as part of the 1st senatorial constituency ([[Arica and Parinacota Region]] and Tarapacá Region).
[[File:Iquique Mounted Police.jpg|thumb|Iquique Mounted Police at Cavanche]]

==Economy==
Iquique has one of the largest duty-free commercial port centers of South America, the [[Zona Franca of Iquique]] (free zone of Iquique) which has been traditionally called ''Zofri''. There are around {{convert|2.4|km2|sqmi}} of warehouses, banking branches, and restaurants.

Copper mining, mainly in Quebrada Blanca, Cerro Colorado, and Doña Inés de Collahuasí, is also an important industry in Iquique.

==Demographics==
[[File:Vista de Iquique, Chile, 2016-02-11, DD 01-06 PAN.JPG|400px|thumb|Panoramic view of Iquique.]]
According to the 2002 census of [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]] (''INE''), the commune of Iquique had an area of {{convert|2835.3|sqkm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="INE"/> and 216,419 inhabitants (108,897 men and 107,522 women). Of these, 214,586 (99.2%) lived in urban areas and 1,833 (0.9%) in rural areas. The township has an area of {{convert|2262.4|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and a population of 166,204 inhabitants. The population grew by 42.7% (64,742 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.<ref name="INE"/> Iquique is home to 56% of the total population of the Tarapacá region. In 2008, the city had 226,204 inhabitants.

In the 1910s and 1920s, about a thousand [[Indian people|East Indian]] (from India and [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]]) [[Sodium nitrate|Chile saltpetre]] mine workers hired by British mine companies appeared in Iquique and today, their descendants are mixed into the local population. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Lately, a wave of [[North Americans in Chile|North American]] and Australian immigrants came to retire and enjoy the city's beach climate.

==Climate==
Iquique has an unusually mild to warm [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''[[BWh]]'') with low extremes of temperatures all year round and almost no rainfall. Due to its abundant cloudiness and coastal location, the climate is often abbreviated to ''BWn'', as opposed to the usual ''BWh'' or ''BWk''.<ref name=Cereceda>{{cite journal |last1=Cereceda |first1=P. |last2=Larrain |first2=H. |last3=osses |first3=P. |last4=Farias |first4=M. |last5=Egaña |first5=I. |year=2008 |title=The climate of the coast and fog zone in the Tarapacá Region, Atacama Desert, Chile |journal=Atmospheric Research |volume=87 |issue=3–4 |pages=301–311 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosres.2007.11.011 |bibcode=2008AtmRe..87..301C |hdl=10533/139314 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> It is common for this place to have completely dry years without any precipitation day, making it one of the driest cities in the world, along with [[Arica]].
