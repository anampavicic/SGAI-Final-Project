'''Bihor County''' ({{IPA|ro|biˈhor|-|Ro-Bihor.ogg}}, {{langx|hu|Bihar megye}}) is a county ([[județ]]) in western [[Romania]]. With a total area of {{convert|7544|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Bihor is Romania's 6th largest county geographically and the main county in the [[historical region]] of [[Crișana]]. Its capital city is [[Oradea]].

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name Bihor is uncertain, except that it likely takes its name from an ancient fortress in the current commune of [[Biharia]]. It possibly came from  ''vihor'', the Serbian and Ukrainian word for "whirlwind" (вихор), or Slavic  ''biela hora'', meaning "white mountain".{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}  Another theory is that Biharea is of [[Daco-Thracian]] etymology (''bi'' meaning "two" and ''harati'' "take" or "lead"), possibly meaning two possessions of land in the Duchy of [[Menumorut]]. Another theory is that the name comes from ''bour'', the Romanian term for [[aurochs]] (from the Latin word ''[[bubalus]]''). The animal once inhabited the lands of northwestern Romania. Under this controversial theory, the name changed from ''buar'' to ''buhar'' and to ''Bihar'' and ''Bihor''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Numele Bihorului.

==Coat of arms==
<!-- Descrierea stemei: Stema judeţului Bihor se compune sfertuit; în primul cartier pe fond roşu, se află un turn crenelat de culoare neagră, zidit, de argint, dotat cu o fereastră şi o poartă închisă Tn cartierul secund , pe fond albastru, se află cinci spice de grâu legate cu o panglică, toate de aur. Tn cartierul trei, pe fond albastru, se află un ciorchine de strugure cu o frunză de viţă, ambele de argint. Cartierul patru, pe fond roşu, cuprinde un hrisov natural, răsucit la capete în sensuri opuse, validat cu o pecete roşie, prinsă cu şnur răsucit, roşu şi negru. Trei brâuri undate, dintre care cel din mijloc mai lat, separate de două benzi albastre, broşează peste linia orizontală. Brâul din mijloc conţine trei peşti negri.<ref name="report">{{cite web|title=2013 Legislative Report|url=http://www.cjbihor.ro/hotarari2013/anexa/h271.pdf|publisher=Bihor County Council|access-date=21 October 2017|page=51|language=ro|date=29 October 2013}}</ref> -->

The coat of arms of Bihor County was adopted in 1998, and is a quarterly shield featuring a castle (for the Castle of Bihar), five wheat stalks with a ribbon, and a scroll with the text of ''[[Deșteaptă-te, române!]]'', covered with a fess featuring three fish. It was subject to redesign in 2013 after it was discovered by a local teacher that the text on the scroll was erroneously written in Greek, rather than Cyrillic (the original alphabet used to write the poem's text) or the Latin alphabet. The county has no significant history with Greece.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Totorean|first1=Adriana|title=Blazon greşit: Stema judeţului Bihor va fi refăcută, deoarece conţine un detaliu penibil|url=http://www.ebihoreanul.ro//stiri/ultima-or-31-6/blazon-gresit-stema-judetului-bihor-va-fi-refacuta-deoarece-contine-un-detaliu-penibil-107750.html|access-date=21 October 2017|work=Ebihoreanul|date=23 April 2013|language=ro}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Romanian counties map}}
[[File:RO - Vârful Bihor 1849 m.jpg|thumb|The [[Cucurbăta Mare]], the highest peak in the [[Bihor Mountains]]]] 
This county has a total area of {{convert|7544|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. In the eastern side of the county there are the [[Apuseni Mountains]], with the highest peak being the [[Cucurbăta Mare]] (also known as the Bihor Peak), at {{cvt|1849|m}}. The heights decrease westwards, passing through the hills an ending in the [[Romanian Western Plain]] – the eastern side of the [[Pannonian plain]].

The county is mainly the [[Körös|Criș]] hydrographic basin with the rivers [[Crișul Repede]], [[Crișul Negru]], and [[Barcău]] the main rivers.

===Neighbours===

* [[Sălaj County]], [[Cluj County]], and [[Alba County]] in the East.
* Hungary in the West – [[Hajdú-Bihar|Hajdú-Bihar County]] and [[Békés (county)|Békés County]]
* [[Satu Mare County]] in the North.
* [[Arad County]] in the South.

==History==
Prior to [[World War I]], the territory of the county belonged to [[Austria-Hungary]] and mostly was contained in the [[Bihar County]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of the war, and the declaration of the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]], the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] took control of the county in April 1919, during the [[Hungarian–Romanian War]]. The territory of Bihor County was officially transferred to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] from Hungary as successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. After the administrative unification law in 1925, the name of the county remained as it was, but the territory was reorganized.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 1938, [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] promulgated a new [[1938 Constitution of Romania|Constitution]], and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. Ten ''ținuturi'' (approximate translation: "lands") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by ''rezidenți regali'' (approximate translation: "Royal Residents") &ndash; appointed directly by the king &ndash; instead of the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefects]]. Bihor County became part of [[Ținutul Crișuri]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In August 1940, under the auspices of [[Nazi Germany]], which imposed the [[Second Vienna Award]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] retook the territory of [[Northern Transylvania]] (which included part of the county) from Romania. In October 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]]. In September 1950, the county was [[Regions of the People's Republic of Romania|disestablished by the communist government of Romania]] and was replaced by the [[Bihor Region]], whose territory comprised an area similar to the old county. Bihor County was re-established in February 1968, when Romania restored the county administrative system.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Economy==
Bihor is one of the wealthiest counties in Romania, with a GDP per capita well above the national average. Recently, the economy has been driven by a number of construction projects. Bihor has the lowest unemployment rate in Romania and among the lowest in Europe, with only 2.4% unemployment, compared to Romania's average of 5.1%.

The predominant industries in the county are:
* Textile industry.
* Food and beverages industry.
* Mechanical components industry.
* Metallurgy.

In the west side of the county there are mines for extracting coal and [[bauxite]]. [[Crude oil]] is also extracted.

==Tourism==
The main tourist attractions in the county are:
* The city of [[Oradea]].
* The [[Apuseni Mountains]]:
** The [[Stâna de Vale]] resort and the [[Iad (river)|Iad River]] valley.
** The Caves around [[Padiș]] and on the [[Sighiștel|Sighiștel River]] valley.
** The [[Peștera Urșilor|Bear's Cave]].
* [[Băile Felix]] Resort.

== Demographics ==

According to the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]], the county had a population of 551,297 and the [[population density]] was {{Pop density|551297|7544|km2|sqmi|prec=1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-rpl-2021/rezultate-definitive-caracteristici-etno-culturale-demografice/|title=Rezultate definitive: Caracteristici etno-culturale demografice|website=Recensamantromania.ro|access-date=28 July 2023}}</ref> 51.1% of its population lives in urban areas, lower than the Romanian average.<ref name="CJBihorCountyProfile">{{Cite web|title=Profil administrativ-teritorial - Consiliul Județean Bihor|url=https://www.cjbihor.ro/despre-bihor/profil-administrativ-teritorial/|url-status=live|access-date=11 February 2022|website=[[Consiliul Județean Bihor]]|language=ro|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412060312/https://www.cjbihor.ro/despre-bihor/profil-administrativ-teritorial/ |archive-date=12 April 2021 }}</ref>
