=== Etymology ===
Berlin lies in northeastern Germany. Most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages]]-derived names. Typical [[Germanization]] for place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are {{Lang|de|-ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch}} and {{Lang|de|-in}}, [[prefix]]es are ''{{Lang|de|Windisch}}'' and ''{{Lang|de|Wendisch}}''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of the [[West Slavs]], and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem {{Lang|pox|berl-/birl-}} ("swamp").<ref>{{Cite book| last=Berger| first=Dieter| title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland| publisher=Bibliographisches Institut| year=1999| isbn=9783411062522}}</ref>

Of Berlin's [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|twelve boroughs]], five bear a Slavic-derived name: [[Pankow]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]], [[Treptow-Köpenick]], and [[Spandau]].

The earliest [[human settlement]]s in the area of modern Berlin are dated around 60,000 BC.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}} A deer mask, dated to 9,000 BC, is attributed to the [[Maglemosian culture]].

The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|access-date=18 August 2008|archive-date=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318232831/https://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist–Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in [[East Germany]]. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html |title=Berlin after 1945 |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH & Co.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Berlin}}

=== Topography ===
[[File:Berlin by Senitnel-2.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Berlin]]
[[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.]]
Berlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree (river)|Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=Google Maps|access-date=18 August 2008|archive-date=18 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220218131221/https://www.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k|url-status=live}}</ref>

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at {{convert|122|m|sp=us}} elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed [[Teufelsberg]] ({{cvt|120.1|m|disp=or}}), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.qiez.de/pankow/wohnen-und-leben/gruenes-berlin/der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-liegt-nun-in-pankow-arkenberge/169588800 |title=Berlin hat eine neue Spitze |trans-title=Berlin has a new top |first=Nikolaus |last=Triantafillou |access-date=11 November 2018 |language=de |publisher=Qiez |date=27 January 2015 |archive-date=22 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722225809/https://www.qiez.de/pankow/wohnen-und-leben/gruenes-berlin/der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-liegt-nun-in-pankow-arkenberge/169588800 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Müggelberge]] at {{convert|114.7|m|sp=us}} elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at {{convert|28.1|m|sp=us}} elevation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/das-ist-die-hoehe-arkenberge-der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-ist-neuerdings-in-pankow/11406254.html |title=Der höchste Berg von Berlin ist neuerdings in Pankow |trans-title=The tallest mountain in Berlin is now in Pankow |date=22 February 2015 |access-date=22 February 2015 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |first=Stefan |last=Jacobs |language=de |archive-date=19 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519014725/https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/das-ist-die-hoehe-arkenberge-der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-ist-neuerdings-in-pankow/11406254.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of {{cvt|22|–|25|C}} and lows of {{cvt|12|–|14|C}}. Winters are cold with average high temperatures of {{cvt|3|C}} and lows of {{cvt|−2|to|0|C}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with [[Urban heat island|heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement]]. Temperatures can be {{cvt|4|C-change|sigfig=1}} higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.com/|title=weather.com|publisher=weather.com|access-date=7 April 2012|archive-date=23 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323015551/https://www.weather.com/|url-status=live}}</ref> Annual precipitation is {{convert|570|mm|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year.

Berlin's history has left the city with a polycentric [[metropolitan area]] and an eclectic mix of architecture. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by German history during the 20th century. 17% of Berlin's buildings are [[Gründerzeit]] or earlier and nearly 25% are of the 1920s and 1930s, when Berlin played a part in the origin of [[Berlin Modernism Housing Estates|modern architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/so-alt-wohnt-berlin/ |title=Alt- oder Neubau?

Devastated by the [[bombing of Berlin in World War II]] many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. After the reunification, many important heritage structures have been [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''[[Forum Fridericianum]]'' along with, the [[Berlin State Opera]], [[Charlottenburg Palace]], [[Gendarmenmarkt]], [[Alte Kommandantur]], as well as the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]].

The [[list of tallest buildings in Berlin|tallest buildings in Berlin]] are spread across the urban area, with clusters at [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]].

Over one-third of the city's area consists of green and open-space,<ref name="Senatsverwaltung für Umwelt, Verkehr und Klimaschutz Berlin, Referat Freiraumplanung und Stadtgrün"/> with the [[Großer Tiergarten]], one of the largest and most popular parks in Berlin, located in the centre of the city.

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{cvt|368|m}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|adj=mid|sp=us|-high}} observation floor. Starting here, the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers, and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The [[Museum Island]] in the [[Spree (river)|River Spree]] houses [[#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|World Heritage]] site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums ([[James Simon Gallery]]), as well as reconstruction of the [[Berlin Palace]] (Stadtschloss) were completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/neumann--stadtschloss-wird-teurer,10917074,10924086.html |title=Neumann: Stadtschloss wird teurer |trans-title=Neumann: Palace is getting more expensive |work=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |language=de |date=24 June 2011 |access-date=7 April 2012 |archive-date=3 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203200703/https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/neumann--stadtschloss-wird-teurer,10917074,10924086.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-nullerjahre--nation-building---der-wiedervereinigte-staat-baut-sich-eine-neue-hauptstadt-das-pathos-der-berliner-republik,10810590,10717494.html |title=Das Pathos der Berliner Republik |trans-title=The pathos of the Berlin republic |work=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |language=de |date=19 May 2010 |access-date=7 April 2012 |archive-date=3 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203200702/https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-nullerjahre--nation-building---der-wiedervereinigte-staat-baut-sich-eine-neue-hauptstadt-das-pathos-der-berliner-republik,10810590,10717494.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Also on the island and next to the [[Lustgarten]] and palace is [[Berlin Cathedral]], emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the Berlin Palace, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of [[Humboldt University]] is there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]] came down.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990 |publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development |access-date=18 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610103008/https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |archive-date=10 June 2008}}</ref> To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]].

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|adj=mid|sp=us|-tall}} lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{cvt|55|m}} and an observation deck {{cvt|126|m}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The [[Oberbaumbrücke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Turks in Germany|Turkish German]] residents,<ref name="Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg"/> making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Berlin Became the World's Second Turkish... |url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/germany/articles/how-berlin-became-the-worlds-second-turkish-capital |website=Culture Trip |language=en |date=6 March 2018 |access-date=23 August 2023 |archive-date=23 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230823212341/https://theculturetrip.com/europe/germany/articles/how-berlin-became-the-worlds-second-turkish-capital |url-status=live }}</ref> In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [[Soviet Union]].

Berlin has a vibrant [[expatriate]] community involving precarious immigrants, illegal immigrants, seasonal workers, and refugees. Therefore, Berlin sustains a broad variety of English-based speakers. Speaking a particular type of English does attract prestige and [[cultural capital]] in Berlin.<ref>{{Cite book | title= English in the German-Speaking World| date= 5 December 2019| isbn= 9781108488099| editor1= Raymond Hickey |publisher= Cambridge University Press | page= 150}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{Main|German language|Berlinerisch dialect}}
German is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm |title=Official Languages |author=European Commission |access-date=29 July 2014 |archive-date=26 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926004848/https://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]].

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|surrounding metropolitan area]]. It originates from a [[Brandenburgisch dialect|Brandenburgish]] variant. The dialect is now seen more like a [[sociolect]], largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [[standard German]] in everyday life.

The most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Persian, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.<ref>{{cite web |date=18 May 2010 |title=how many- languages are spoken in berlin |url=https://berlinbnb.co/2023/12/15/how-many-languages-are-spoken-in-berlin-2/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522160634/https://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wirtschaft/article1309952/Zwei-Millionen-Berliner-sprechen-mindestens-zwei-Sprachen.html |archive-date=22 May 2011 |access-date=2 June 2011 |publisher=Morgenpost.de}}</ref>

=== Boroughs ===
{{Main|Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods]] ]]
Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (''Bezirke''). Each borough has several subdistricts or neighborhoods (''Ortsteile''), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called ''[[Kiez]]''. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}<!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

Public transport in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20th-century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since 1989, the transport network has been developed extensively. However, it still contains early 20th century traits, such as the U1.<ref>{{Cite book |author= Winfried Wolf |title=Berlin, Weltstadt ohne Auto? : Verkehrsgeschichte 1848–2015 |date=1994 |publisher=ISP |isbn=3929008742 |edition=1.

=== Airports ===
[[File:Berlin Brandenburg Airport at night.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER) at night]]
Berlin is served by one commercial international airport: [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing [[Berlin Tegel Airport|{{lang|de|Tegel|nocat=y|italic=no}} Airport]] (TXL) and [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport|{{lang|de|Schönefeld|nocat=y|italic=no}} Airport]] (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.<ref>{{cite web| first=Emily| last=Schultheis| date=6 November 2018|access-date=23 May 2019|title=Whatever happened to Berlin's deserted 'ghost' airport?| url=https://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20181030-what-happened-to-berlins-ghost-airport| publisher=BBC| archive-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530013917/https://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20181030-what-happened-to-berlins-ghost-airport|url-status=live}}</ref> Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Berlin's new $7 billion airport has finally opened after 9 years of delays, corruption allegations, and construction woes— see inside |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/berlin-brandenburg-airport-finally-opens-after-9-years-of-delays-2020-11?r=US&IR=T |website=Business Insider |access-date=9 November 2020 |archive-date=9 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109200613/https://www.businessinsider.com/berlin-brandenburg-airport-finally-opens-after-9-years-of-delays-2020-11?r=US&IR=T |url-status=live }}</ref> The planned initial capacity of around 27&nbsp;million passengers per year<ref>{{cite web |access-date=23 May 2019 |title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg BER |url=https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/1872865-2932875-airport-berlin-brandenburg-ber.en.html |website=berlin.de |archive-date=25 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025182145/https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/1872865-2932875-airport-berlin-brandenburg-ber.en.html |url-status=live }}</ref> is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55 million per year by 2040.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=23 May 2019 |title=BER: A brief history of how not to build an airport |url=https://www.tip-berlin.de/ber-a-brief-history-of-how-not-to-build-an-airport/ |date=24 April 2019 |archive-date=25 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425145806/https://www.tip-berlin.de/ber-a-brief-history-of-how-not-to-build-an-airport/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Before the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as BER. Both airports together handled 29.5&nbsp;million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlin-airport.de/en/press/press-releases/2014/2014-03-28-summer-flight-schedule/index.php |title=2014 summer flight schedule |website=FBB |access-date=10 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911063838/https://www.berlin-airport.de/en/press/press-releases/2014/2014-03-28-summer-flight-schedule/index.php |archive-date=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> {{lang|de|Tegel|italic=no}} Airport was a focus city for [[Lufthansa]] and [[Eurowings]] while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like {{lang|de|[[Germania (airline)|Germania]]|italic=no}}, [[easyJet]] and [[Ryanair]]. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller [[Tempelhof Airport]], which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city center, allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport. The airport grounds have since been turned into a city park.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}

== Rohrpost ==
{{Main|Rohrpost in Berlin}}
From 1865 to 1976, Berlin operated an expansive [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic postal network]], reaching a maximum length of 400 kilometers (roughly 250 miles) by 1940. The system was divided into two distinct networks after 1949. The West Berlin system remained in public use until 1963, and continued to be utilized for government correspondence until 1972. Conversely, the East Berlin system, which incorporated the ''Hauptelegraphenamt''—the central hub of the operation—remained functional until 1976.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}

== Energy ==
[[File:Berlin-mitte heizkraftwerk-mitte 20060605 629.jpg|thumb|Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant]]

Berlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and the Berlin-based company [[GASAG]]. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern [[Brandenburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|title=European Green City Index Berlin Germany|website=Siemens|year=2009|access-date=19 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913113150/https://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|archive-date=13 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{As of|2015}} the five [[List of power stations in Germany|largest power plants measured by capacity]] are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these [[power station]]s generate [[electricity generation|electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.

In 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] is the backbone of the city's energy grid.

Berlin is home to 44 theaters and stages.<ref name="berlin.de"/> The [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Mitte was built in 1849–50 and has operated almost continuously since then. The [[Volksbühne]] at [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]] was built in 1913–14, though the company had been founded in 1890. The [[Berliner Ensemble]], famous for performing the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], was established in 1949. The [[Schaubühne]] was founded in 1962 and moved to the building of the former Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm in 1981. With a [[seating capacity]] of 1,895 and a stage floor of {{convert|2854|m2|0|sp=us}}, the [[Friedrichstadt-Palast]] in Berlin Mitte is the largest show palace in Europe. For Berlin's independent dance and theatre scene, venues such as the Sophiensäle in Mitte and the three houses of the [[Hebbel-Theater|Hebbel am Ufer (HAU)]] in Kreuzberg are important. Most productions there are also accessible to an English-speaking audience. Some of the dance and theatre groups that also work internationally ([[Gob Squad]], [[Rimini Protokoll]]) are based there, as well as festivals such as the international festival [[Tanz im August|Dance in August]].

Berlin has three major [[opera house]]s: the [[Deutsche Oper]], the [[Berlin State Opera]], and the [[Komische Oper]]. The Berlin State Opera on [[Unter den Linden]] opened in 1742 and is the oldest of the three. Its musical director is [[Daniel Barenboim]]. The Komische Oper has traditionally specialized in [[operetta]]s and is also at Unter den Linden. The Deutsche Oper opened in 1912 in Charlottenburg.

The city's main venue for musical theater performances are the Theater am Potsdamer Platz and [[Theater des Westens]] (built in 1895). Contemporary dance can be seen at the ''Radialsystem V''. The [[Tempodrom]] is host to concerts and circus-inspired entertainment. It also houses a multi-sensory spa experience. The [[Admiralspalast]] in Mitte has a vibrant program of variety and music events.

There are seven symphony orchestras in Berlin. The [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] is one of the preeminent orchestras in the world;<ref>{{cite news |author=Charlotte Higgins and Ben Aris in Berlin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/29/germany.arts |title=Is Rattle's Berlin honeymoon over? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 April 2004 |access-date=7 April 2012 |location=London |archive-date=28 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828013033/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/29/germany.arts |url-status=live }}</ref> it is housed in the [[Berliner Philharmonie]] near Potsdamer Platz on a street named for the orchestra's longest-serving conductor, [[Herbert von Karajan]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/travel/music-berlin.html |title=Music: Berlin |first=Daniel J. |last=Wakin |work=The New York Times |date=25 September 2005 |access-date=2024-08-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240829173728/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/travel/music-berlin.html |archive-date=2024-08-29}}</ref> [[Simon Rattle]] was its principal conductor from 1999 to 2018, a position now held by [[Kirill Petrenko]].

Berlin is also home to a diverse gastronomy scene reflecting the immigrant history of the city.
