'''East Nusa Tenggara''' ({{langx|id|Nusa Tenggara Timur}}) is the southernmost [[provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]]. It comprises the eastern portion of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], facing the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south and the [[Flores Sea]] in the north. It consists of more than 500 islands, with the largest ones being [[Sumba]], [[Flores]], and the [[West Timor|western part]] of [[Timor]]; the latter shares a land border with the separate nation of [[East Timor]]. The province is subdivided into twenty-one [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] and the regency-level city of [[Kupang]], which is the capital and [[List of Indonesian cities by population|largest city]].

Archaeological research shows that [[Liang Bua]] cave in East Nusa Tenggara has been inhabited by humans since about 190,000 years ago. The site was home to early humans, including ''Homo floresiensis'', who were found in the cave's archaeological layers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Examining the Traces of Indonesian Little People in Liang Bua Cave |url=https://indonesia.go.id/kategori/commodities/1448/examining-the-traces-of-indonesian-little-people-in-liang-bua-cave?lang=2 |access-date=2024-10-12 |website=indonesia.go.id}}</ref>

East Nusa Tenggara is known for its natural beauty such as Komodo National Park, Labuan Bajo, Lake Kelimutu, and exotic beaches. The province is rich in culture, with diverse tribes, languages, and traditions such as ikat weaving and the Pasola ceremony in Sumba.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kain Tenun Nusa Tenggara Timur – Geonusantara |url=https://www.geonusantara.org/2018/03/14/kain-tenun-nusa-tenggara-timur/ |access-date=2024-08-30 |language=en-US}}</ref> East Nusa Tenggara also has a strong missionary history, seen from the majority Catholic population and one of two Indonesian provinces where Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion, alongside [[South Papua]].<ref name="AGAMA">{{cite web|url=http://nttprov.go.id/2018/index.php/kondisi-umum/keagamaan|last=|first=|title=Persentase Agama yang Dianut Menurut Kabupaten/Kota di Provinsi Nusa Tenggara Timur 2019|website=www.nttprov.go.id|accessdate=12 May 2020|archive-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127064929/http://nttprov.go.id/2018/index.php/kondisi-umum/keagamaan|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition, its marine ecosystem is very rich, making it a popular destination for divers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara |url=https://www.travelfish.org/region/indonesia/east_nusa_tenggara |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=Travelfish |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
After [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|the declaration of Indonesian independence]] in 1945, the eastern part of Indonesia declared the [[State of East Indonesia]].<ref>Statute of ''Staatsblad'' No. 143, 1946.</ref> The state was further included in the [[United States of Indonesia]] as part of the agreement with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] contained in the [[Indonesian National Revolution#Transfer of sovereignty|transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia]] in 1949.

In 1950, United States of Indonesia dissolved itself into a [[unitary state]] and began to divide its component area into provinces. In 1958, by Indonesian law (''Undang-Undang'') No. 64/1958, three provinces were established in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]: [[Bali]], [[West Nusa Tenggara]] and East Nusa Tenggara.<ref>{{Citation| author=[[Government of Indonesia]]| url=http://www.djpp.depkumham.go.id/incl-php/buka.php?d=1900+58&f=uu64-1958.htm |title=Establishment of the First-level Administrative Regions of Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara |edition=in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] |id=UU No. 64/1958 |date=11 August 1958 | access-date=2007-08-24 |publisher=Indonesia Ministry of Law and Justice}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The area of East Nusa Tenggara province included the western part of [[Timor]] island, Flores, Sumba and many smaller islands in the region.

The province was originally (from 1958) sub-divided into twelve [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]],<ref>{{Citation| author=[[Government of Indonesia]]| url=http://www.djpp.depkumham.go.id/incl-php/buka.php?d=1900+58&f=uu69-1958.htm |title=Establishment of the Second-level Administrative Regions under the First-level Administrative Region of Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara |edition=in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] |id=UU No. 69/1958 |date=9 August 1958 | access-date=2007-08-24 |publisher=Indonesia Ministry of Law and Justice}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> but on 11 April 1996, the City of '''Kupang''', was separated from Kupang Regency and given regency-level status. Then, following the fall of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|Suharto regime]] in 1998 and the passage of a new regional autonomy law, there was a dramatic subdividing (known as ''pemekaran'') of regional governments across Indonesia, at both provincial and regency level. Between 1999 and 2012, nine new regencies were created in East Nusa Tenggara by the division of existing regencies:
*On 4 October 1999, a new '''[[Lembata Regency]]''' (Regional code 53.13) was formed by the division of the [[East Flores Regency]].<ref>{{Citation| author=[[Government of Indonesia]]| url=http://www.djpp.depkumham.go.id/incl-php/buka.php?d=1900+99&f=uu52-1999.htm |title=Establishment of Lembata Regency in the East Nusa Tenggara province |edition=in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] |id=UU No. 52/1999 |date=4 October 1999 | access-date=2007-08-24 |publisher=Indonesia Ministry of Law and Justice}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
*On 10 April 2002, [[Rote Island]] and adjacent islands were split off from [[Kupang Regency]], to form a new '''[[Rote Ndao Regency]]''' (53.14).<ref>{{Citation| author=[[Government of Indonesia]]| url=http://www.djpp.depkumham.go.id/incl-php/buka.php?d=2000+2&f=uu9-2002.pdf |title=Establishment of Rote-Ndao Regency in the East Nusa Tenggara province |edition=in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] |id=UU No. 9/2002 |date=10 April 2002 | access-date=2007-08-24 |publisher=Indonesia Ministry of Law and Justice}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
*On 25 February 2003, [[Manggarai Regency]] was split into two and a new '''[[West Manggarai Regency]]''' (53.15) was established.<ref>{{Citation| author=[[Government of Indonesia]]| url=http://www.djpp.depkumham.go.id/incl-php/buka.php?d=2000+3&f=uu8-2003.pdf |title=Establishment of West Manggarai Regency in the East Nusa Tenggara province |edition=in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] |id=UU No. 8/2003 |date=25 February 2003 | access-date=2007-08-24 |publisher=Indonesia Ministry of Law and Justice}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
*On 2 January 2007, the administration of East Nusa Tenggara province was expanded by the establishment of three new regencies <br>– [[Nagekeo Regency|'''Nagekeo''']] (53.16) was cut out of [[Ngada Regency]], and [[Central Sumba Regency|'''Central Sumba''']] (53.17) and [[Southwest Sumba Regency|'''Southwest Sumba''']] (53.18) were both cut out of [[West Sumba Regency]].
*On 17 July 2007 a new regency of [[East Manggarai Regency|'''East Manggarai''']] (53.19) was cut out of [[Manggarai Regency]].
*On 29 October 2008 a further regency – [[Sabu Raijua Regency|'''Sabu Raijua''']] (53.20) (comprising the Savu Islands group) – was formed from part of the remaining [[Kupang Regency]].
*On 14 December 2012 yet another regency – [[Malaka Regency|'''Malaka''']] (53.21) – was created out of the southern half of [[Belu Regency]].

Therefore, as from early 2013, there are twenty-one regencies plus the one [[Subdivisions of Indonesia|autonomous city]] ([[Kupang]]) in the province.

The Census population of the province was 4,683,827 in 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 5,325,566 in 2020,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref>

Based on the latest data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), the population of East Nusa Tenggara Province has reached around 5.5 million people.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Nusa Tenggara Timur Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.53)</ref> Population growth in East Nusa Tenggara is at a fairly stable level, although variations in growth rates are seen in various districts and cities. Kupang City as the provincial capital is the city with the largest population, followed by other large regencys such as Sikka and Manggarai.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Projection Number of Population by Sex - Statistical Data - BPS-Statistics Indonesia Nusa Tenggara Timur Province |url=https://ntt.bps.go.id/en/statistics-table/2/NTU2IzI=/proyeksi-jumlah-penduduk-menurut-jenis-kelamin.html |access-date=2024-09-02 |website=ntt.bps.go.id}}</ref>

The average population density in East Nusa Tenggara is around 110 people per km², but the population distribution is uneven. Urban areas such as Kupang City have a much higher density than rural areas spread across the outer islands, such as Alor, Rote, or Savu.

===Ethnicity and religion===
East Nusa Tenggara Province is known for its very rich ethnic and cultural diversity. Ethnicity in East Nusa Tenggara consists of several main groups, including the Flores tribe, Sumba tribe, Timor tribe, Rote tribe, Alor tribe, and Sabu tribe. Each tribe in East Nusa Tenggara has its own regional language that is different from each other, including Manggarai language, Ngada language, Sikka language, Sabu language, Rote language, and various other dialects. Indonesian is used as the official language in administration and education, but regional languages are still used in daily life in many local communities.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024 |title=Jurnal Pengabdian kepada Masyarakat |url=https://openrecruitment.radenfatah.ac.id/index.php/elkiraas/article/download/21972/6857/ |access-date=30 August 2024 |website=Elkiraas |publisher=UIN Raden Fatah}}</ref>

East Nusa Tenggara Province is one of the provinces in Indonesia with a majority Christian population, both Catholic and Protestant. The influence of Christianity is very strong in East Nusa Tenggara, especially in the Flores and Sumba regions, which were influenced by the arrival of European missionaries, especially from Portugal and the Netherlands, centuries ago. In Flores, around 85% of the population is Catholic, making it one of the areas with the largest Catholic population in Indonesia.

However, East Nusa Tenggara also has a significant Muslim community, especially in Kupang City and certain regencies such as in coastal areas or on islands such as Alor and Timor. In addition, there are also Hindus, as well as local beliefs that are still adhered to by some people, especially in Sumba and Timor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Percentage of Religious Followers - Statistical Data - BPS-Statistics Indonesia Nusa Tenggara Timur Province |url=https://ntt.bps.go.id/en/statistics-table/2/ODQjMg==/persentase-pemeluk-agama-.html. |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=ntt.bps.go.id}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Sodli |first=Ahmad |date=2016 |title=Kerukunan Umat Beragama di Provinsi Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) |url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/41969-ID-kerukunan-umat-beragama-di-provinsi-nusa-tenggara-timur-ntt.pdf |access-date=30 August 2024 |website=Neliti |publisher=“Analisa” |language=id}}</ref>

== Economy ==
The economy of East Nusa Tenggara Province is dominated by the agriculture, fisheries, and tourism sectors. Most of the East Nusa Tenggara population works in the agricultural sector, with main crops such as corn, rice, cassava, beans, and coconuts. The livestock sector also plays an important role, especially in areas such as Sumba and Timor, where many residents raise cattle, horses, and pigs.

In addition, the fisheries sector is one of the main sources of livelihood for people in coastal areas and small islands. Fish, seaweed, and other marine products are important commodities developed by local communities.

[[File:Nihi Sumba.jpg|alt=Nihi Sumba Aerial|thumb|282x282px|A resort along Nihiwatu Beach]]

On the other hand, the tourism sector in East Nusa Tenggara has experienced rapid development in recent years, especially with the increasing popularity of tourist destinations such as '''Labuan Bajo''' and '''Komodo National Park''' which attract tourists from within and outside the country. The stunning natural beauty such as exotic beaches, volcanoes, and underwater biodiversity are the main attractions for tourists.

=== Economic activity ===
[[File:Borassus flabellifer.jpg|thumb|The [[Borassus flabellifer|Lontar palm]] has high significance in local agriculture]]

East Nusa Tenggara Province has a diverse economy with agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cultivation as its main pillars. Subsistence farming dominates economic activity, with corn and smallholder plantation crops such as coffee being the main products. Local plants such as the lontar palm (Borassus flabellifer) and the sugar palm (Arenga pinnata) also play an important role in the local economy.<ref>James J. Fox (1977), ''Harvest of the palm: ecological change in Eastern Indonesia'', Harvard University Press, Boston.</ref>

On Sumba Island, palm trees play a major role in providing wood, roofing materials, and producing food in the form of fruits and palm sugar obtained from tapping the fruit stems. In other areas such as West Manggarai, palm trees are also a source of raw materials and processed products that are useful for local communities. Products from palm and palm trees can even be processed into alcoholic beverages through traditional fermentation, which is part of the local economy.<ref>Markus Makur, [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/08/14/abraham-manggas-rescuing-sugar-palms.html "Abraham Manggas: Rescuing sugar palms"], ''The Jakarta Post'', 14 August 2012.</ref>

In addition, the forestry sector also plays an important role in supporting the provincial economy. Forests in East Nusa Tenggara provide important resources such as firewood, building materials, and other non-timber products used by local communities. Forestry managed with sustainable principles not only contributes to the economy, but also helps maintain ecosystems and environmental balance, which is very important for communities that depend on natural resources.

Seaweed farming is one of the fastest growing economic sectors in coastal and island areas. In the Alor Islands, for example, informal village-based seaweed farming has become an important source of additional income for the community. Much of this seaweed is exported in its raw form to countries such as Japan, indicating greater economic potential in this sector.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2013/12/farming-alor-islands "Farming the Alor Islands: One man's weed"], ''The Economist'', 18 December 2013.</ref>

Fisheries are also a mainstay sector for coastal communities. Marine products such as fish, shrimp, and various other marine products are not only a source of food for local communities but also have great potential as export products. This fisheries activity makes a significant contribution to the local economy.

Overall, the economy of East Nusa Tenggara is highly dependent on the use of natural resources traditionally managed by local communities. With agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and seaweed farming as the backbone of the economy, the province continues to develop its potential while preserving the environment and local cultural richness. Through sustainable management of natural resources, East Nusa Tenggara seeks to improve the welfare of its people and strengthen its contribution to the national economy.

'''Poverty and Alleviation in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT)'''

NTT is known as one of the poorest provinces in Indonesia, with various factors causing chronic poverty in this region. The arid geographical conditions and consisting of remote islands make access to basic resources and services difficult. Agriculture, which is the main livelihood, is often hampered by less fertile soil and prolonged drought, resulting in low agricultural productivity. In addition, limited infrastructure worsens people's access to education, health, and markets.<ref>{{Cite book |last=TNP2K |url=https://kms.tnp2k.go.id/index.php?p=show_detail&id=392&keywords= |title=Kemiskinan di Nusa Tenggara Timur, Ciri dan Determinannya |date=2011 |publisher=TNP2K |language=Indonesian}}</ref>

The low level of education in NTT is also one of the main causes of poverty. Limited access to education, especially in rural areas, means that many children cannot continue their education, thus hampering their ability to get better jobs. This is exacerbated by poor health conditions, where many residents cannot access basic health services due to the lack of medical facilities, health workers, and remote access.

The government and various organizations have made a number of efforts to alleviate poverty in NTT.  Some of these include the development of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and health facilities, which aim to open access and improve connectivity throughout the region. Programs to improve the quality of education such as building schools and sending teachers to remote areas are also being implemented to increase school participation rates.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-07 |title=Perubahan Kemiskinan di NTT dan Faktor Penentu Kesuksesan Rote Ndao - ROTENDAOKAB.GO.ID |url=https://rotendaokab.go.id/perubahan-kemiskinan-di-ntt-dan-faktor-penentu-kesuksesan-rote-ndao.php |access-date=2024-08-30 |language=id}}</ref>

Efforts to empower the community's economy include skills training and access to micro-credit to encourage small and medium enterprises. The tourism sector, which has great potential in NTT, has also begun to be developed as an alternative source of income. In addition, the government has launched social assistance programs such as the Family Hope Program (PKH) and Non-Cash Food Assistance (BPNT) to support poor families in meeting their basic needs.<ref>Abidin, Zainal, et al. "Poverty Alleviation Through Village Fund Policy in East Nusa Tenggara." Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Social Sciences, Humanities, Economics, and Law (ICoSHEL), 30 Oct. 2019, European Union Digital Library, doi:10.4108/eai.30-10-2019.2299419. Accessed 2024-08-30.</ref>

Although various programs have been implemented, challenges still exist. Corruption, slow bureaucracy, and lack of community involvement in development often hinder the effectiveness of the program. In addition, the impact of climate change on agriculture adds to the complexity of the problem. However, with a sustainable approach and active community participation, there is hope that poverty in NTT can be reduced significantly, bringing prosperity to its residents.<ref>Nalle, F.

==Infrastructure==
Although infrastructure development in East Nusa Tenggara continues to grow, the province still faces challenges in terms of inter-island connectivity. Land, sea, and air transportation continue to be improved to connect remote areas, but some areas are still difficult to reach, especially during the rainy season when road conditions become less good. On the other hand, the construction of roads, bridges, ports, and airports has been carried out in stages to improve mobility and accessibility, as well as support economic and tourism development in the province.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pemerintah Provinsi NTT Menggelar MUSRENBANG RKPD Tahun 2025 Dan RPJPD Periode 2025 S/D 2045 – Dinas Komunikasi & Informatif Provinsi NTT |url=https://diskominfo.nttprov.go.id/2024/05/21/pemerintah-provinsi-ntt-menggelar-musrenbang-rkpd-tahun-2025-dan-rpjpd-periode-2025-s-d-2045/ |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=diskominfo.nttprov.go.id}}</ref>

===Education===
Education in East Nusa Tenggara continues to improve despite various challenges. Accessibility to education is still difficult, especially in remote areas and islands, where many schools lack basic facilities such as proper buildings, laboratories, and libraries. The quality of teaching also needs to be improved due to the uneven distribution of teachers and the lack of qualified teaching staff in rural areas. Efforts to improve this sector continue to be carried out through government programs such as scholarships and the construction of new schools, although infrastructure and teaching staff challenges remain major issues.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-01-27 |title=Kondisi Pendidikan di Pedalaman NTT yang Masih Tertinggal |url=https://blog.insanbumimandiri.org/pendidikan-di-pedalaman-ntt/ |access-date=2024-08-31 |website=Blog Insan Bumi Mandiri |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023 |title=Tantangan Pendidikan di NTT dalam Upaya Meningkatkan Akses dan Mutu |url=https://ombudsman.go.id/perwakilan/news/r/pwk--tantangan-pendidikan-di-ntt-dalam-upaya-meningkatkan-akses-dan-mutu- |access-date=30 August 2024 |website=Ombudsman RI |publisher=Ombudsman Republik Indonesia}}</ref>

===Health===
The health sector in East Nusa Tenggara sees major challenges in terms of access to and quality of health services. Many remote areas are difficult to reach, and health facilities are often inadequate with limited equipment and medicines. The shortage of medical personnel, especially in rural areas, further exacerbates this situation. Major health problems in NTT (East Nusa Tenggara) include malnutrition, high maternal and infant mortality rates, and infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Efforts to improve are being made through the construction of new health facilities, national health programs, and interventions from non-governmental organizations, although geographic and logistical challenges remain major obstacles.<ref>{{Cite web |last=adminsek |date=2024-06-04 |title=kesehatan |url=https://satudatasektoral.nttprov.go.id/kesehatan/ |access-date=2024-08-31 |website=Satu Data Sektoral |language=id}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017 |title=Perbedaan Karakteristik Demografi dan Riwayat Infeksi Malaria Menurut Status Gizi Balita di Provinsi Nusa Tenggara Timur |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317796726_Perbedaan_Karakteristik_Demografi_dan_Riwayat_Infeksi_Malaria_Menurut_Status_Gizi_Balita_di_Provinsi_Nusa_Tenggara_Timur/fulltext/594c3eb2458515e70348ac50/Perbedaan-Karakteristik-Demografi-dan-Riwayat-Infeksi-Malaria-Menurut-Status-Gizi-Balita-di-Provinsi-Nusa-Tenggara-Timur.pdf |access-date=30 August 2024 |website=ResearchGate |publisher=ResearchGate |language=id}}</ref><ref>Celebrating its 75th anniversary, WHO calls for health for all from East Nusa Tenggara</ref>
